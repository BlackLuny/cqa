I know that it's almost the weekend and nobody probably wants to answer a question about school, haha, but I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to help me out. :D   Okay, so next year I am hoping to take grades 11 and 12 (parents making me be home-schooled so I figured what the heck) and then go to college or university right away the following year. But, i don't know exactly when I would be supposed to apply, because I heard it's best to apply near Christmas to get a spot, but I will technically still be in the 11th grade! If I wait until April when I am well into 12th grade, then would it be too late? And would my chances decrease of getting into the school for applying late? I heard that you can start college/university in January, would that probably be better?   Also, if I did the whole two grades in one year thing, and went to college or university the next year, I would only be 15. Would schools be less likely to accept me because of my age, even if my grades are good?   I know that I shouldn't plan my whole life based on Y!A answers but I am just looking to get a clearer view on the whole situation, so please don't tell me I am being dumb. I just want to figure this out, my parents are not being any help :P   Thank you in advance!   ~Amatiel~

He has shouted at us and said we were the worst school he had been to because we are rude and disrespectful. He became really angry at some students in my class but he gets angry and shouts at the whole class after. Today he said that all people in the class were to make the sign of the cross and pray. There is a jewish girl in my class and she refused to make the sign of the cross for some reason. My religion teacher blew up and asked who in the class was catholic. then he said, 'It's bad enough that only six people in this class are catholic and we're in a catholic school, but some people actually refuse to take part in religious prayer.' The girl was crying and he took her to the head of religion but just when he came back this really dumb girl was throwing a liquid ink pen onto the ceiling fan and it splattered everywhere. he blew up again and said the whole class was on a fifteen minute detention at lunch even though about three people were involved in the incident. I just wanted to ask is it actually alright for a religion teacher to force someone to pray and make the sign of the cross?

20090219214537AA0U9ZK	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Is it embarrassing to be the last student to finish an exam or a test?	I wrote a Math test today. I got so frustruated when I saw other students leaving. I forgot the the Math solutions, I started sweating even though I tried to calm myself it didn't help. It got worse when there were 3 students left in the class..and got ever worser when I was the only one left. I was so embarrassed and I only had 10 minutes left and 4 problems to solve. I didn't finish because I felt like a loser and a stupid. This happened again last week when I took a Biologhy test, but I left the classroom when I saw that there were only 4 students left I didn't wanna be the last one.       Is it normal? If not what can I do? I don't write fast because sometimes I have to read a question 2 or 3 times just to get it right.

I'm a high school senior right now and even though I was accepted to a couple of 4 year colleges they aren't the schools I want to get into, they were all state colleges. So instead I was thinking i'll enroll into a community college and hopefully will be able to transfer to a better University, something of a UC standard because i live in California. But is this a bad choice if I want to get into a good med school? Will they look down upon the fact that I went to community college first and did that whole transfer thing?

20090219170046AAi9rlF	Education & Reference;Quotations	MLA citations...................?	I have a paper due for english tomorrow and I am supposed to use MLA citations.  Most of the choices are just analyzing the books but I chose the option where you make up a narrative from the main character's perspective and you make up what happen's to him after the story. So I was wondering how to cite the information when it is mostly made up.  I know that I have to do some sort of bibliography because the whole story is based off this book.  But I was wondering what to do in the case of in-text citations.  The teacher didn't specify what to do on the assignment sheet and I don't have time to ask him because it is due tomorrow.  Do you think I should just refer back to a few things that were done in the book and cite them just to be safe?
20090219154222AAlV9a2	Education & Reference;Homework Help	How can i do better in science?	I having trouble in science, i have a C in there. My mom is pressuring me to get a B in there. (It's like im her little trophy thing that she can brag around). She's making me study the whole chapter just so i can get it. I got an F on my last teat and that's HER fault for making me study. It seems like if i don't study, i seem to do better.   But i don't know what to do, i told my teacher about it, and she said she'll help me after school.   But i don't want to stay after school and get help from her. And i don't really like help from my parents either. And most of the time, my study habits are bad because all i do is go on the computer and look up other things.   Which doesn't help me at all with studying.   Can you guys give me some tips on how do study better/do better in science?   I really don't wanna let my parents down and i want to do better in that class.

20090219185553AAQIHhd	Education & Reference;Homework Help	8th grade english paper help?	Story Draft      ''Hey Nicole. You know the girl that is adopted? Her name is Megan Lang. She's so fat and ugly.'', Amanda commented, as her and Nicole were strolling down the hallway, before lunch, at East High.      ''Oh my god, yes I know her! Shes in my history class. I totally agree. All she ever talks about is Guitar Hero and being rich. Shes horrible at Guitar Hero. You should see her piggy bank. Its usually empty. She thinks I'm her friend, but the only reason I accepted the invitation to her house after school last week was so that I can spy on her for more evidence.'', Nicole replied, as lockers slammed, and people ran down the hallway.      Lunch period comes...      ''Hey Amanda...Why were you backstabbing me, earlier this morning?'', Megan asked, with a slight feeling of nervousness.      ''Backstabbing?...I didn't do anything...You know I'm you're best friend and would never do such thing to you.'', Amanda replied.      ''Liar. I heard you and Nicole a few hours ago.'', Megan defended, with an attitude.      ''No, that was Nicole. I was just listening to her.'', Amanda shuddered.      ''Stop putting it off on Nicole. You're a liar. You're both making me feel worse.'', Megan snapped.      ''Okay whatever, it still isn't me...'', Amanda mumbled, as she walked away.      Two periods later, in computer class...      ''I want to go onto MySpace and check out my Truth Box Application. I bet everyone loves me and thinks I am their sister, except Nicole and Amanda.'', Megan thought as she was typing      ''OH.... MY..... GOD....!!!! YOU STUPDI LIARS!! LIARS!!! LIARS!!'', Megan yelled, as her face turned red.      The first message displayed ''You stupid bum. Everyone hates you.''   2nd message: ''2 simple words. Ugly and fat. How dare you think everyone loves you. What a shame. Shame, shame, shame...''   3rd message: ''So...This is that stupid adopted brat that thinks everyone loves her, but everyone wants to kill her.''      Megan began to cry.      ''WHY??? Why does this have to happen to me?? WHY ME??'', Megan whined.      ''What happened?'', her friend Sarah asked, as she walked over to Megan and sat down next to her.      ''Look at the screen!'', Megan answered, as she was crying.      ''Aw, sweetie...Well, I think you should relax and be happy that at least everyone's being polite, for the time being. I would also hate it if I found out I was being back stabbed.'', Sarah explained, as she took Megan's hand to comfort her.      Class lets out.      As Sarah was strolling down the hallway, she spotted Amanda.      ''Hey, whats up Amanda?'', Sarah greeted.   ''Hey, whats up?'', Amanda repeated.   ''Nothing much. Can you do me a favor?'', Sarah requested.      ''What?'', Amanda asked.   ''Can you please stop talking about Megan?'', Sarah requested.   ''Yes. As a matter of fact, I was going to apologize. I was shopping at Juicy Couture, spotted her dad, and he told me he works there. I began to feel bad for calling Megan fat, poor, and everything.'', Amanda answered.      ''Oh and by the way, I am not friends with Nicole anymore.'', Amanda added.       ''What? Why?'', Sarah questioned.      ''Because I told her what I just told you. She was all bitchy about it and was like '' I don't care. I think she's still what we said in the first place, fat, and ugly. I mean, look at her.''      I just walked away from her.'', Amanda answered.          This Story Needs   *A place for irony (like where in the story would it make the most sense to add irony/make it ironic)   *A place for foreshadowing (where in the story would it make sense for foreshadowing)   *An ending   *A title   *Punctuation/grammar corrections (not sure about those)   *A scene that can be expanded

20090219203236AAvNpGC	Education & Reference;Teaching	Have any of you experienced  this epiphany?	Hey. I'm 19 years old. I think I've realized something tonight. Have any of you experienced the same? Well, when I was 17, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer for various reasons. I decided to choose political science as a major because I find the subject matter very interesting and I also love history, and just knowledge in general. A little after I turned 19, I changed my prospective hopes with respect to my major from physics, biology, to math. Personally, I am not very strong in mathematics. I was in a phase where I thought I would conquer my mathematical deficiencies by just consuming and practicing the material. Well, long story short, I just realized that I wasn't at all that committed, strong in, or THAT interested in biology, physics, and particularly mathematics to actually major in them - even though I find the subject matter in all three fascinating (though biology is my favorite out of the three). So, I've come back full circle to settle on political science because I know that it reflects my strengths, and interests; political science combines history as well. On a side note, I have reduced my future job/career to either a teacher or lawyer, but we shall see what the future has in store...      I love history, I love science, and I am fascinated by how mathematics is knitted in everyday phenomena. I remember from a young age I always loved social science. I am generally interested in learning, and I greatly appreciate knowledge. So where I'm getting at is, I think that I am really interested in all of these things, but social science is my strong suit, even though I am fascinated by the sciences and enjoy my time watching my Nat Geo/Discovery channel programs and reading about them online. I think of myself as a type of renaissance man, if you will, in that respect. But I think I'm going to go with my strong suit and choose political science. I really enjoy the sciences, but I think I will leave that to reading and watching programs about science to feed my learning appetite for them. Because, maybe some of you have been here before, but haven't you ever felt after watching The Universe on the History Channel that you wanted to be a scientist and major in physics or biology? Ha ha.

I have been doing homeschooling on and off like I think I did the rest of the year in 5th, whole 6th, and now almost all 7th.  I went like 1 week of public school in 7th grade but I didn't like it.  It is so strict in the middle school at my public school.  My sister said high school there is soooo easy and fun.  I am more of a quiet/shy person but I open up to my friends and new people I meet.  I am alittle bit more ahead than the other kids that are at my public school.  I know more than them because my homeschool taught me alot more faster.  In homeschool, I feel I have more time to thoroughly learn everything and it is so much easier to me.  The ONLY reason I would go to public school is because I believe I should experience dating so its easy when i'm older.  I am not boy crazy or anything but I just don't want to be a loser.  When I go to public school, everyone loves me and wants to be my friend.  I have horses and show them so I love being home with them.  I just love homeschooling but don't want to be a loser who has no experience dating guys.  And, I think it will help me stop being so quiet and shy.  I don't know if I shouild join public school or not......

I haven't really learned much so I don't really know if I should take the exam or not. I do qualify for the fee wavier which covers almost everything, I only have to pay $5. So should I take the chance and just take the test even if I might fail? And will that effect my college application at all? (I hope not).

20090219221147AA3lOAp	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What is a surface wave, p-wave, and s-wave?	Well, I'm studying about the earth quake. And my teacher gives us questions to answer. Most of them are pretty easy, but since I don't have the article that I was supposed to have (My teacher said I had to get it after school, but I had a game so i couldn't pick it up). So, one of the question asks how the earthquake wave moves and where each one travels. I've already answered p-wave and s-wave, but not surface wave. Since i'm not entirely sure, would you mind answering the question for all three?      Heres what It said.   Write what you know about how each earthquake moves (side to side or push and pull) and where each one travels (through the body of the earth or along its surface)   a. p-wave   b. s-wave   c. surface wave

For an essay I have to write in english I need to interview a parent with a child who has down syndrome, considering my topic. I have just eight questions to ask about the subject of using plastic surgery to alter one with Down's appearance, which some parents have already gone to. I am in no way trying to offend any one by these questions but just need some personal answers due to my research. If you cannot yourself answer these questions but can have someone else answer them please give them these questions as well. Thanks to anyone who is willing to help!!! Here are my questions------      1. How old is your child with Down syndrome?   2. What was your first reaction to knowing that your child had Down’s?   3. Did you think of the future being difficult for your child because of their condition?   4. How did others around you react to the diagnosis?   5. Have you ever thought of changing your child’s appearance to make them look more, to what some may say ‘normal’?   6. There have been a couple of parents who have already altered their child with Down’s appearance surgically, what is your take on that?   7. Would you consider or would you have ever considered changing your child’s looks now that you know of this being an option.   8. Is this morally right to you that people are doing this because they are personally bothered by their child?      Thank you once again for giving your imput, it is greatly appreciated.
