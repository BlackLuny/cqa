I am the teller and my boss who does loans, runs the office as a supervisor. When I got hired I was told that I would be a teller but, that I would also open accounts including CD's & Money markets, And that I would also do all type of loans. When I got there in August I was ok but for the last month I've been realizing that I am doing more work then my boss and I am getting paid less & I dont understand why? I am a teller, answer phones,send fax, bring her a cup of water when she ask, make copies, open account, do applications for Mastercards, order cash for the vault & ATM, Balance the ATM, count the money when we receive it, post a loan if I need to, do customer service ALL the time. While she sits in her office and does loans only. And I am getting paid $12hr and I am sure she gets paid more then me, shes been there `10 yrs. Is she taking advantage that I am there so that I can do everything for her?

20081012154733AANcnDe	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	If 'toxic mortgages' are the cause of the current worldwide financial crisis why can't they be the solution?	If mortgages have been arranged at a level people can't possibly afford to repay - then why are we having to prop up the banks - wouldn't it be more sensible to recalculate - e.g. extend the loan to 25 years and reduce the payments so that the mortgage would continue to be repaid, then at least the banks would be getting their money back without us having to prop them up.  Arranging mortgages in the knowledge that they are in excess of the mortagee's capability of keeping up the repayments is fraudulent!  I haven't heard this word mentioned YET!

I'm 17 and sick of working in retail so i've decided to start getting into graphic design and probably work as a receptionist.      Only thing is, i don't know how to get into either of them.   Ages ago i started a course for "business admin" but it turned out to be all the difficult subjects too like accounting, which i failed at. So i ended up quitting.      Is there any other courses or any other way to do reception?    if your a receptionist, how did you get into it?          Then there's graphic design, which i realize you have to do courses for.    But there's so many different graphic designers. I want to do something like photo imaging or editing. What jobs can i get from doing that? Besides the magazines. And how do i get into it? I was thinking of just doing basic photo editing courses for Adobe and working my way up.       Sorry i know that's a lot of questions. It's just my hours have been cut down a lot cause they can't afford people anymore. So i need a new job but i want to start getting into a career rather than retail again.

20060718110715AARlPbd	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Should I  abandon the  family business i worked 14 years  for a better opportunity abroad?	My family bussines started 45 years ago. I had decided to take off due to inestabilty of the country where i live. Due to political and economical situation finances in our company are not doing good. Last week I recieved a job proposal from abroad and spoke with my dad about it . He got ballistic . My mom called me also stating i will give my dad a heart attack . My wife thinks it is a good chance and oportunity to leave the country and have a better life abroad with more oportunities. She is afraid of my other brothers to take advantage of me someday will kick me out from the family bussines. She knows i will not fight them . That's why i rather go and find a new way of living . I am still young ( 30 yrs ) but i don't want to break my dad's heart who has been a good mentor, a friend and a boss , but everytime i want to do something for my own , like studies or personal oportunities , he find it difficult to let me do what i have to do .

I've been looking to get into management (an assistant position), a position in a hotel, or a finance position.  But it seems like they all require too much experience for the management jobs and all of the finance ones are too based on sales, and it seems like there is always a catch.  I had the highest grades in my class and I have been working at a law office as an assistant for the past two years so I feel like I should be able to get a good job.  Please help!  Where should I look and what should I look for?

Sometimes at the Unemployment office.  College Career Advisement Offices tended to be good resources, too.  Then Monster.com became a big deal.  During the Bubble, recruiters were really popular - now only used for CEOs.  Craigslist also had gained prominence among certain localities.  Colleges have enhanced their alumni association networks, but mostly re-post stuff from commerically-available websites?
