ThYN1mFFaa	50 mM means 50 mmoles/liter.  If you know the molar mass of the chemical, then you multiply that number by 50 to give the number of grams equal to 50 moles.  Divide that by 1000 to get 50 mmoles.  Dissolve that mass in 1 liter and you have a solution that is now 50 mM.

0U6fSHGOaa	In order to understand why the sky is the color that it is there are a couple of factors that should be taken into consideration. The atmosphere, light waves, the different colors of light, and the light in the air all have to be taken into consideration when approaching thisquestion.<br>  <br>  The atmosphere is composed of different gas molecules and many other materials, but it mostly contains oxygen and nitrogen. Water vapor, ice crystals, and drops of water are also a common thing in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is very dense where it meets the earth and it gets thinner as it blends into space. <br>  <br>  Light is a form of energy, and this form of energy moves and radiates throughout the universe in the form of waves. Light travels in waves of vibrating magnetic and electric fields. Light waves are part of a larger thing known as the electromagnetic spectrum; the spectrum is composed of many vibrating electromagnetic fields.<br>  <br>  There are many different colors of light. Visible light is the part of the spectrum that humans can see. Light in your home from your lamp or the light from the sun in the sky may appear to be the color white, but this is not so.

This belief rests on the fact that there are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. There remains a very significant possibility of life existing somewhere else. The exact form of life that can exist is a matter of speculation – it need not be carbon and oxygen-based like it is on earth. Moreover, these life forms may or may not have evolved intelligence, as we know it.<br>  <br>  Aliens need not look like us to resemble us in more fundamental ways. We now know that our solar system was formed in a way that is common to many stars. Consider that the four most common elements in the Universe are hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen. Helium is inert. The three most abundant, chemically active ingredients in the cosmos are also the top three ingredients in life on Earth. For this reason, you can bet that if life is found on another planet, it will be made of a similar mix of elements. <br>  <br>  Conversely, if life on Earth were composed primarily of, for example, molybdenum, bismuth, and plutonium, then we would have excellent reason to suspect that we were something special in the Universe. So, I think the chances are better than ever that there is life elsewhere in the universe.|`|GIH9JB04aa	Millions? I don't know!

De4vgWXPaa	They're classified in various ways, and I don't which sort of classification you might mean.  You can have a chemical classification in line with their constituents, a pharmacological one in accordance with their effects, or a hard to soft classification in accordance with their potential for resulting in dependency and possible harmful effects.  The latter is a legal formulation which isn't necessarily based only on scientific grounds.<br>  <br>  Other forms of classification are doubtlessly around for various reasons.  Sadly, I've no idea what "classes A, B C" actually means.  Should those have legal significance, then the equivalent in Germany would presumably be in the hart / weich area (hard to soft).

nuhi9H6paa	To begin with, Earth is rotating on its axis at the familiar rate of one revolution per day. For those of us living at Earth's midlatitudes -- including the United States, Europe, and Japan -- the rate is almost a thousand miles an hour. The rate is higher at the equator and lower at the poles. In addition to this daily rotation, Earth orbits the Sun at an average speed of 67,000 mph, or 18.5 miles a second. This is not normally noticeable (other than the fact that day turns to night etc) except when you take a photo with a very long exposure (540 sec) of the night sky and then you can see star trails. <br>  <br>  You can view either a map of the Earth showing the day and night regions at this moment, or view the Earth from the Sun, the Moon, the night side of the Earth, above any location on the planet specified by latitude, longitude and altitude, from a satellite in Earth orbit, or above various cities around the globe on this site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/vplanet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/vplane...</a>|`|YOqbGO2Maa	The speed around the Sun changes during the year.

Indeed it must have been pretty risky to be in inner-city Gaza during the bombardment.<br>  <br>  I'd rate eastern Congo, Ituri province, as pretty dangerous, and North Korea has an ongoing problem with famine.  People regularly die trying to escape, so goodness knows what it's like inside.<br>  <br>  Colombia has had a long-running problem with guerilla armies and drugs gangsters, though recently the government seems to be getting on top of that.  Violent crime is at epidemic rates in parts of South Africa (though large parts of the country are relatively free from that), and living in Zimbabwe will be dangerous because of cholera, malnutrition and state brutality if you dare to object.  Burma (Myanmar) has a pretty oppressive government, prone to kill many of its people whenever they show signs of non-obedience.  A similar fate awaits Tibetans trying to flee Chinese rule.<br>  <br>  Darfur (Sudan) has had a savage guerilla war for some years, and Somalia is in the grip of armed factions vying for control.  Things are flaring up again in Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan's tribal areas have a related war going on.<br>  <br>  There are many unstable places that can be quiet, but then can flare up with much killing.  Some flare ups are a complete surprise - Ivory Coast was one of Africa's success stories before the recent civil war, and the scale of killing and ethnic cleansing during the Bosnian war shocked Europeans.  Even during that war, many more people were being killed in South Africa's Natal due to political instability.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, many long-running situations can change, and dreadful circumstances can improve.  Cambodia and East Timor underwent virtual genocide (Khmer Rouge, Indonesian occupation), but both have left those days behind, though not without some problems.  Iraq has been pretty dangerous as a result of the coalition occupation and opposing militants, though that may now be on its way to stability.<br>  <br>  So, it's always changing!  It seems the world is slowly improving; the number and scale of conflicts at present is still far less than during the 'proxy wars' of the cold war, and we've come a long way from the scale of medieval warfare, though there are exceptions like the Holocaust and Armenian genocide.<br>  <br>  Oh, and other dangerous places would be due to the natural world; towns near an erratically active volcano, the coastal towns of a tsunami-prone zone, etc.<br>  <br>  Which is the most dangerous at this moment?  I'd still put Ituri province top of the list.|`|Rl4tJrhxaa	a place in which people dont respect humans or animals , place which people left their religion and , people dont respect women or children , people dont respect their religion .<br>  israel is the most dangerous place in the world|`|VcrDOsFKaa	whereby men live......|`|T8jmDogAaa	volcano
nYLzis9Saa	There should be no difference in odds regardless of where you purchase them, but we can't be sure if the lottery is slightly biased.<br>  <br>  And if you've got 300 tickets, the odds of winning is simply 300 in 14 million as you said because you've got 300 shots at a 1 in 14 million prize.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way. If there is a pot with 5 balls in it. 4 with 'lose' written on and one with 'win' written on. <br>  <br>  If you're allowed to choose one ball, your odds are 1/5.<br>  <br>  If you instead can choose two balls, you now have a 2 in 5 chance of choosing a win ball because the odds of the first ball being a winner and the odds of the second ball being a winner are both 1/5. and 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. It's the same principal with the lottery tickets.|`|403a9814784d30c5279c74857501be15aa	It makes no difference where you get the tickets from - just make sure each ticket has a different set of numbers.

5H7Wgaknaa	It all boils down to solving spherical triangles. You construct a spherical triangle on the celestial sphere using three points, the RA & Dec of the object, the RA & Dec of your zenith point and the north celestial pole.<br>  The RA of your zenith is the local sidereal time and the Dec is your latitude.<br>  The side of the triangle between your zenith and the object is 90o - ALT.<br>  The side between the north celestial pole and your zenith is 90o - LAT.<br>  The side between the north celestial pole and the object is 90o - Dec.<br>  The angle at the corner of the triangle at the north celestial pole is the hour angle of the object.<br>  The angle at the corner of the triangle at your zenith is 180o - AZ.<br>  To determine hour angle, convert UT to your local sidereal time (LST) and the hour angle is LST - RA.<br>  The general formulae for spherical triangles are as follows.<br>  The angles of a triangle are A, B, C and the opposite sides are a, b, c. Then<br>  sin(a)sin(B) = sin(b)sin(A)<br>  sin(a)cos(B) = cos(b)sin(c) -sin(b)cos(c)cos(A)<br>  cos(a) = cos(b)cos(c) + sin(b)sin(c)cos(A)<br>  sin(a)cos(C) = sin(b)cos(c) - cos(b)sin(c)cos(A)<br>  sin(a)sin(C) = sin(c)sin(A)<br>  The formulae you have already been using will have been derived from the above.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	Yes there is a way.

And mutation will introduce changes to the genes which can be selected against.<br>  <br>  Secondly, there will still be genetic heterogeneity across the population of worms. Individuals will not be all the same (they aren't clones of each other), so there are still variations on which natural selection can act.<br>  <br>  Remember - bacterial evolution (eg the emergence of antibiotic resistance) is a classic example of evolution-in-action.

Mr4DFAVkaa	There are multiple ways to go into neurology. One way is through a graduate program in neurology (to obtain a Ph.D.)... to do this, you would typically major in a science (neurology, biology, etc.) in undergraduate school, where you'd receive your B.S. After this, you could apply to graduate programs, which require 2-3 years of classes, followed by a dissertation period, during which you'd do research (in a clinical or laboratory setting), eventually publishing a work and earning your degree.<br>  <br>  If you'd prefer to go the medical route, you'd receive your bachelor's degree in whatever field you'd like, making sure to take the prerequisite classes for medical school (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.), then applying to medical school, where you'd earn your D.O. or M.D. You can then apply to residencies in neurology, which last 4 years in a hospital setting, after which you are free to practice medicine. <br>  <br>  It is certainly difficult to go either route, but undoubtedly rewarding, and neurology is a fascinating field. I'd recommend picking up some books to read about it - Oliver Sacks is a very well known neurologist with some great books - start with The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat... it is a collection of case studies, and will give you an idea of the type of patients you might see as a neurologist.

PvVs4VIzaa	According to collision theory, only those collison with sufficient energy and collide at correct orientation only lead to product. So it is impossible that every molecule could have overcome the activation energy and form the products.  <br>  <br>  Since this is a reversible process, the EF produced will eventually convert back to AB and CD. at equilibrium, Kc = [EF]/[AB][CD]|`|AA12212224	No.<br>  <br>  The chance that every ab molecule will collide with every cd molecule is pretty low. There's bound to be some AB and CD molecules remaining.<br>  <br>  Additionally, this is a reversible reaction. EF molecules do not have to stay EF molecules. Some will revert back to reagent. The amount of EF at the end depends on the equilibrium constant of the reaction.<br>  <br>  It's like shaking blue and red lego pieces in a box. The pieces need to collide into each other to connect and make a product, but each piece has to hit the other hard enough, and in the right place, to stick. And, if they do stick, they might break apart from the shaking and colliding with other pieces. You would find that you'd never get all the pieces to stick in pairs perfectly.

FHi4drsmaa	Well, what you are trying to do is make a non-newtonian fluid, and one way to do this is to mix Corn Starch and Water. Here is what Wikipedia says about it.<br>  <br>  An inexpensive, non-toxic example of a non-Newtonian fluid is a suspension of corn starch (corn flour) in water, sometimes called oobleck (uncooked imitation custard, being a suspension of primarily corn flour, has the same properties). The application of force — for example by stabbing the surface with a finger, or rapidly inverting the container holding it — leads to the fluid behaving like a solid rather than a liquid. This is the "shear thickening" property of this non-Newtonian fluid. More gentle treatment, such as slowly inserting a spoon, will leave it in its liquid state. Trying to jerk the spoon back out again, however, will trigger the return of the temporary solid state. A person moving quickly and applying sufficient force with their feet can literally walk across such a liquid|`|V3u2R0Tpaa	WTF? you cannot make a solid liquid as each has different properties. A solid is a solid pretty much becasue it is not a liquid or a gas. Things cannot pass through it easily. If ur question is how to make a solid into a liquid then this is accomplished by providing the solid enough heat to melt. Like solid ice left at room temperature, turning into the liquid water.|`|GI0Mkzwzaa	You can make a solid liquid if the solid will reach its melting point and melts. Just be sure that the solid you are melting is not combustible otherwise it will burn.|`|8V7gSeAlaa	You have to make the solid reach it's melting point.<br>  For water it's more than 0 degree C.
kvP6bAySaa	The reaction is mildly exothermic, therefore if you reduce the temperature the position of the equilibrium will shift so as to nullify the change - in other words, it will shift so as to INCREASE the temperature back up again, so to do that it will drive the reaction in the direction of the exotherm, i.e. to the right, which is also the direction corresponding to the formation of methanol.<br>  <br>  If you increase the pressure, the equilibrium will again shift so as to nullify the change, so it will shift to DECREASE the pressure back down again. To do that it will convert more gas (CO2 and H2) to liquid (methanol), therefore increasing the yield of methanol.<br>  <br>  The key thing to remember is principal of le Chatalier, which says that whenever a change is made to a reaction that is in equilibrium, the position of equilibrium will change so as to remove the change.|`|2ef5ca5a39098769a8dac8a2f3c15f57aa	The reaction is an equilibrium reaction, meaning that not all of the reactants will be converted.  The goal is to design the process so that conversion is maximized.<br>  <br>  Reaction rates are higher at elevated temperatures, however, equilibrium shifts to the left as temperature rises.  Additionally, there is a minimum temperature at which the reaction will proceed at all.  The chalange is to design a catalyst that lowers the minimum temperature to start the reaction.  One the reactions starts, heat is liberated and the temperature rises to the point that equilibrium is reached and the reaction stops.<br>  <br>  The reaction is favored by higher pressure because there are fewer moles on the right side than the left side.  As the reaction proceeds, there are fewer moles to occupy the volume (Avogadro's law) and so pressure is reduced.  This is know as Le Chatelier's Principle.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Andesite is a gray to black volcanic rock with between about 52 and 63 weight percent silica (SiO2). Andesites contain crystals composed primarily of plagioclase feldspar and one or more of the minerals pyroxene (clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene) and lesser amounts of hornblende. At the lower end of the silica range, andesite lava may also contain olivine. <br>  Andesite magma commonly erupts from stratovolcanoes as thick lava flows, some reaching several km in length. Andesite magma can also generate strong explosive eruptions to form pyroclastic flows and surges and enormous eruption columns. <br>  <br>  Andesites erupt at temperatures between 900 and 1100° C.<br>  <br>  The word andesite is derived from the Andes Mountains, located along the western edge of South America, where andesite rock is common. <br>  Andesite was the main rock type erupted during the great Krakatau eruption of 1883.

This is a ratio of 162/11 or about 14.73 to 1.  Similarly, if you compare 10.5' to 8.5" you get a ratio of 252/17 or about 14.82 to 1.<br>  <br>  So if you divided your room dimensions by 15, you'd have something that fit on the paper and filled most of the page.

ayB4KsTraa	You're asking why does the order not go 4s, 4d? Remember that would be completely missing out the third energy level. Electrons fill up from the lower levels and gradually work their way out further. This is the basis of the Aufbau principle.<br>  <br>  The order in which the electrons fill is 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d (although you would normally write the final two the other way round). This is because the 4s is actually slightly lower in energy than the 3d orbital. Basically, there is an overlap between the end of the third level and the beginning of the fourth.

So you can use that formula either way if you define a positive velocity as moving away from you.    So solve the equation for your speed:  v = c (observed wavelength - proper wavelength)  / (observed wavelength + proper wavelength)    Remember, interpret a positive answer as a receding object and a negative one as an approaching object.

Freaks, for some reason, always seem more popular in America.    ---    The Mayan calendar merely reaches a round figure.    us -- them    2012.12.20 = 12.19.19.17.19  2012.12.21 = 13.00.00.00.00  2012.12.22 = 13.00.00.00.01  and so on.    The Mayans themselves wrote about events that they say will happen (on Earth and involving humans) well after the year we call 4000.  They use their calendar to give the date.    Obviously, they expected neither the world nor their calendar to end.|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Don't pay attention to the freaks. The world doesn't end in 2012.    This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage?     ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes.   ? Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|De4vgWXPaa	So why pay attention to freaks?|`|LRH9Em0yaa	No..  http://www.universetoday.com|`|7w2Oi1ixaa	Well actually i was researching and may i tell u (copy from another site).  Could there be a bright comet in years 2009-2012? On another page of this Revelation 13 site, I discussed how I thought there could be another bright comet in the next few years, as bright as comets Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake. I relate this to the April 11 1997 fire that the Shroud of Turin narrowly escaped, which was also near the time of peak brightness of Comet Hale-Bopp, with the Shroud of Turn being supposedly the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. The Shroud is kept in a cathedral in Turin, Italy. When the Shroud of Turin narrowly escaped a fire on December 4, 1532, there were seen three bright comets in the years 1531, 1532 1533. I think these three comets in 1531-1533 represented the Holy Trinity -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And at that time there was a major upheaval in Christianity, the Protestant Reformation begun by Martin Luther, and this was shortly after the defeat of a Moslem invasion of Europe at Vienna Austria in October 1529. And therefore will three bright comets be seen during the years near the recent Shroud fire? There have been only two bright comets, Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake.    So will another bright comet be seen soon (there was a very bright Comet McNaught in January 2007)? And will there be a great upheaval in religion with the new Millennium? If another bright comet is seen in years 2009-2012, then these three comets of the new Millennium may represent, rather than the Holy Trinity, the Unholy Trinity of Satan and his two sons the Antichrist and the False Prophet (as described in the Bible's Book of Revelation chapter 13). Although there were 3 barely visible comets in May 2004 (not nearly as bright as Comet Hale-Bopp): Comet Bradfield C/2004 F4, Comet NEAT C/2001 Q4, Comet LINEAR C/2002 T7.  And in May 2006 there was a moderately bright comet, a fractured comet whose pieces are observable with binoculars: Comet S-W3 73P, Comet 73P / Schwassmann-Wachmann 3. It was closest to earth on May 13 and closest to the sun on June 6 (6-6-06!). Also, it is interesting that this comet was discovered by two German astronomers as Hitler was rising to power in Germany in 1930. There could be an Antichrist connection to this comet, with the Hitler discovery connection part of that, and its being closest to the sun on the Beast Number date 6-6-06 (see the Calendar page on 6-6-06). Comet S-W 3 is actually a broken up comet like Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 that hit Jupiter in 1994, that is now actually a bunch of minicomets. ). Comet SW3 was discovered by Arno Arthur Wachmann and Arnold Schwassmann at Hamburg Observatory in Bergedorf Germany, on May 2 1930. The coordinates of Bergedorf are: 53-29 N, 10-13 E. It passed near earth on May 31 1930. At that time Hitler was rising to power, where in a 1930 election the Nazi Party won 18.3% of the vote. So this 6-6-06 comet may be connected with the rise to power of the Antichrist. Perhaps the number 73 relates to Psalm 73. And note that Comet S4 Linear blew apart into pieces on July 28, 2000, as the Antichrist Putin was rising to power in Russia. Perhaps this blown apart comet near 6-6-06 may also somehow relate to Putin?        Note that the number of the antichrist is 666, and 1999 has 666 upside-down, and 1998=666x3. This would suggest that the disastrous events described in the Book of Revelation are occurring now, including weather changes, storms and hurricanes, weather and climate change, volcanos, earthquakes, terrorism, and diseases such as AIDS, Flu, and Mad Cow Disease.    There was a barely visible comet in year 2000. Comet C/1999 S4 LINEAR was discovered in Socorro New Mexico on September 27, 1999 by the LINEAR team of scientists. In late July 2000 it was barely visible to the unaided eye, much dimmer than Comet Hale-Bopp, and it blew apart and disappeared near July 28. It was closest to the sun on July 26 2000. This could be related to the inauguration of President Putin (the Antichrist) in Russia in May 2000.        Above: Hubble Space Telescope photo of Comet S4 LINEAR fragments on Aug. 5 2000, a few days after it blew apart. Source: NASA    Also, in late 2002 and early 2003 there was a barely visible Comet NEAT (C2002 V1), which was discovered Nov. 6, 2002, at the time SARS disease started in China. On Feb. 18, 2002, Comet NEAT was hit by a giant solar flare from the sun, as photographed by the SOHO solar satellite, when it was near the sun, at the time SARS started spreading more. See the SARS page and my discussion of why SARS may be related astrologically to Comet NEAT.        SOHO photo of Comet Neat blasted by a solar flare on Feb. 18, 2002  Source: SOHO (ESA & NASA)    So, could there be another bright comet in 2009 to 2012, as bright as Comet Hale-Bopp, and could this be another comet that is not yet discovered that will be the bright Millennium comet? We will have to see. Three dimly bright comets in the Spring of 2004 were:  Comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) w|`|stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

Ftkr9jqYaa	The hydrologic cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.  Water can change states among liquid, vapor, and ice at various places in the water cycle.<br>  <br>  The scientific consensus expressed in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Summary for Policymakers is for the water cycle to continue to intensify throughout the 21st century, though this does not mean that precipitation will increase in all regions. In subtropical land areas — places that are already relatively dry — precipitation is projected to decrease during the 21st century, increasing the probability of drought. The drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the subtropics (for example, the Mediterranean Basin, South Africa, southern Australia, and the Southwestern United States). Annual precipitation amounts are expected to increase in near-equatorial regions that tend to be wet in the present climate, and also at high latitudes. These large-scale patterns are present in nearly all of the climate model simulations conducted at several international research centers as part of the 4th Assessment of the IPCC.<br>  <br>  Glacial retreat is also an example of a changing water cycle, where the supply of water to glaciers from precipitation cannot keep up with the loss of water from melting and sublimation. Glacial retreat since 1850 has been extensive.<br>  <br>  Human activities that alter the water cycle include:<br>  <br>  agriculture <br>  industry <br>  alteration of the chemical composition of the atmosphere <br>  construction of dams <br>  deforestation and afforestation <br>  removal of groundwater from wells <br>  water abstraction from rivers <br>  urbanization<br>  <br>  Human activities, and changes in the biosphere caused by human overpopulation, agriculture, and greenhouse gases, have caused dramatic global warming (i.e., increases in mean hydrospheric temperatures), resulting in rapid melting of glaciers and polar icecaps, which may soon cause much coastland, and many islands, to be overrun by water or submerged.<br>  <br>  During colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form, and enough of the global water supply accumulates as ice to lessen the amounts in other parts of the water cycle. The reverse is true during warm periods. During the last ice age, glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth's land mass, so that the oceans were about 400 ft (122 m) lower than today. During the last global "warm spell," about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 18 ft (5.5 m) higher than they are now. About three million years ago the oceans could have been up to 165 ft (50 m) higher.  Current projections indicate that ocean levels are likely to be as high by the end of the twenty-first century as they were 125,000 years ago.  The consequences of reduced land mass and increased desertification may be disastrous for human populations.

QnvgAdwbaa	Fertility is basically the quality of being able to reproduce, Fertility can also come in different "strengths", you can be very fertile or you can be infertile basically meaning you can reproduce very easily or infertile means you cant reproduce at all, such as if you have chemotherapy or it can occur naturally. Any more questions... feel free to ask :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|z0bTttPbaa	FERTILITY:- <br>   It is the natural potential of giving birth or reproduction i.e. the state of being fertile and sustaining luxuriant and vigorous growth .<br>  <br>  It is the ratio of the number of live births in a region or area to the population of the region.

S8H5yYcoaa	You want to notice two important things here: cotangent is 1/tangent, and an angle of 330 is the same as an angle of 360-330 = 30.    cot(30) = 1/tan(30) = cos(30)/sin(30) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(1/2) = sqrt(3).
AuKKjaxaaa	There are 20 cows.

So 5/17 of the combined herd are cows and 12/17 are pigs.  5/17 of 68 is 5/17 x 68 = 20 cows.
M9JcanLKaa	The baby weighs 3.8 kg and you want 10 mg/kg, so you want 380 mg.  The suspension has 120 mg/5ml, so you want  380/120 * 5 ml, or 190/12 ml = 15.83 ml|`|EN32vSsCaa	First figure out the dose  10mg/kg x 3.8kg  38mg (40mg is OK)    Setup  120mg/5ml = 40mg/xml    Cross multiply  (120mg) * (xml)  =  (5ml) * (40mg)    Solve for x  x = (5ml * 40mg) / 120mg  [the mg cancel out leaving ml]  x = 1.7ml    Since no calculators are allowed, reduce before solving for x  x = (5ml * 1mg) / 3mg  x = 5ml / 3 [the mg cancel out]  x = 1 2/3ml or 1.7ml    EDIT:  Learn from RobA's  mistake.  He multiplied the baby's weight by 100mg/kg instead of 10mg/kg.  Also, use intuitive thinking, 380mg is an adult dose, you would not give that much to a baby.  Rob, I don't mean to demean you, just using it as a learning tool.
i0ypGmlQaa	1. You can choose any one of the five odd digits at each step. There are six steps to building up a code. Thus the answer is:    5  5  5  5  5  5 = 5^6 = 15625    2. You can simply use any rearrangement of those odd digits. The answer is:    5! = 5  4  3  2  1 = 120    If you don't know how to arrive at that, just pick one for the first digit (5 choices) and then remove it from consideration. Pick the next digit (4 choices) and remove. Then 3 choices, 2 choices, 1 choice, done.|`|ZHvJ1hbVaa	1.  Since repetition is allowed, there are 5 choices for each digit of the six-digit code.

xopIi2Vfaa	I am tired of hearing people state their uneducated opinion as facts. We know quite a bunch about evolution of wings. Just because you can't be bothered to read thoroughly up on it doesn't make your opinion valid.    And the beginning of life is abiogenesis, and if you had been reading science magazine you would know that evolution in self replicating RNA molecules has been recently observed. There was an article about it a few weeks ago as well as a pretty good review on our current knowledge on abiogenesis by Carl Zimmer. But can you be bothered to read current literature on the subject? Obviously not.    Edit: sorry, buddy. Maths doesn't support different viewpoints either. If you insist 1+1=7 you will have to put up with some ragging. Science tends not to be a matter of opinion. If you think it should be, just tell gravity not to work for 2 minutes when you next fall off a high ledge...|`|eulMjLtPaa	Wow, you're brilliant.  I've never thought about these things.

And God said, "Let there be evolution."|`|9vvaFxEeaa	Evolution does not purport to explain how life began, but merely how life came to exist as we know it/see it today.  Evolution is a theory that is based on facts.  There are undeniable truths contained within the theory of evolution.  Evolution is a theory just as Newton's theory of gravity.  We now know that Newton's theory of gravity was flawed, but the facts supporting the theory are nevertheless facts.      The Big Bang theory attempts to explain how so much matter was created out of space.  This is closer to a theory that tries to explain the origin of life, however, that is not the basis of the Big Bang theory.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	1) we don't need direct observation to make conclusions, you don't seem to care that we have never observed a quark. anyway, there are observed intances of animals of the same species that changed so much one population from another, that they were no longer able to reproduce! that's the arousal of a new species!  2) evolution doesn't explain how life began.. abiogenesis does.  3) lizards never evolved wings, dinosaurs walking on their back legs did.  4) what other model of the diversity of life do you propose? you do know that you have to provide evidence FOR it to prove it, not point out dumb things against evolution?    for the record: science is not a belief system.. it is a way of aquiring knowledge through observation and "connecting the dots".|`|X4EBNoNUaa	sponge your disbelief in evolution frompersonal incredulity is typical cerationist blather.

First of all evolution does not say how life began only how it evolved from a common ancestor. You would know this if you actually knew anything about evolution.

Intelligent Design and Creationism are the real reasons as to how this earth was created. Evolution is a bunch of incoherent nonsense|`|1oxBCtmZaa	SPECIES evolve.   Indivual specimens generally do not, but species do.   And that was the main point.    Darwin's point was that species evolve randomly, through "natural selection" - - grizzlies got caught behind the glacial frontier and the ones born white via genetic mutation survived and they mated and the polar bear thus evolved from the grizzly.    A grizzly didn't shed his brown fur and sprout white fur.    Now if you want to believe that God caused the glacial expansion and caused the few grizzlies to be caught behind the glacial frontier and caused the white grizzlies to be born, then that would be some form of guided evolution - it doesn't mean that evolution didn't occur.    It's really a question of philosophy rather than biology.    You might also try reading Henri Bergson's "Creative Evolution"|`|972057f8360b85c255e8dbc7c9bcf59baa	i completely agree there is no evidence on how life began.  you should check out Expelled by ben stein it has some good facts and interveiws about the whole matter.|`|stHol8ITaa	Can't offer any proof? How's this for proof:    http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14...    Not only is the fossil evidence present, but we've SEEN evolution occur right in front of our eyes. Oh, and by the way, there has been no "leaps" in evolution, though fossils might give this impression due to the fact that they're rare (they require perfect conditions for fossilisation to occur). And the theory of evolution has nothing to do with how life occured, what you're thinking of is abiogenesis. Do some research on it.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Actually, your wing argument is really bad. Basic biology shows literally thousands of examples of animals with undeveloped or useless parts of their bodies. If life just springs up, where do these parts come from? Take the legless lizard, for example. It has little knobs on its body where the legs used to be. What purpose do these tiny knobs serve otherwise? None. Or take the human body. There are several organs in the body, including the appendix, that are not necessary. Perhaps they were in the past. Perhaps they will be in the future. Lord knows.     In any case, what you really seem to be missing is basic, primordial biology-- i.e. the studies of microorganisms. We can watch how they develop and create themselves, and see how they evolve into mutated and more complex versions of themselves. Many viruses and bacterias have proven to practically create themselves from non-living matter. That is the key to the theory that life evolved. All it takes is simple logic to trace all these changes back into time and consider how life began, theoretically it is true, but theory based on many, many facts. Doesn't make evolutionary beginning of life a proven fact, but it makes it FAR from impossible and FAR from not being logically observable.    Suggestion: why don't you take a biology class in university and discuss this with someone who actually knows what they are talking about. You seem to be harboring a lot of misconceptions about science, evolutionary theory, and scientific method.|`|KIJ10pCWaa	I totally agree that there is n scientific evidence to prove that evolution is real. I believe that God made everything and that it says NO where in the Bible that God created gorilla and monkey that some how magically people were "evolved" from nothing. God knows what he is doing and there is no proof that evolution actually happened. People are people and monkeys are monkeys. Thats that. Um sure scientists can draw pretty pictures of monkeys evolving into monkeys but it is all FAKE. This is what I believe because I am a christian and I go by what our Creator says. Thanks for letting me state my opinion.|`|qq5nceCXaa	OK evolution doesn't create life it creates diversity, for creation of life you'll be wanting Abiogenisis, but don't worry it'll be in the same area in the library.    Wings could easily evolve.  Look at gliding squirrels and bats.  See how one uses the flap of skin to slow down it's fall and the other actually flies?  So maybe a climbing lizard used to hop from tree to tree.  Any variation that helped it go a bit further, or stopped it from falling onto the ground and into danger would be favoured.  Eventually you have a gliding structure.  Now any variation that allowed flapping and increased lift would be favoured until you end up with flying.  Oh sure you need the variation and lots of time, but millions of years and millions of generations does allow that to happen.    Oh and you seem to be in favour of facts which I think is great.  So any facts to support an altenative solution?  any facts for a god maybe?  No though not.|`|LnL2T4oIaa	yes it is possible. it is a proven fact with years of research  backing it up. animals evolve and adapt to there changing environment. for example, if  a lizard goes into a snowy place and somehow the offspring chain continues for a million years the lizard type will turn white and create a type of skin for cold weather. so why is the theory more insane than a spirit who has just been there taking clay and creating the universe and the world in 6 days?|`|iw1IFxhBaa	There is no such thing as evolution... it is all a big blunder... and so obviously there is no proof for it... life was created by God... only He can explain it... many evolutionists tried to prove that life came into existance through evolution .... but they never succeeded.... all their efforts were useless... they even "MADE" fossils to prove it like "The PILTDOWN MAN" by Dawson (consisting of the lower jawbone of an orangutan that had been deliberately combined with the skull of a fully developed, modern man.) which was later exposed in 1953 as a forgery by the flourine content test.

The Universe works according to its own laws. A tree that doesn't have a firm grip with the ground will fall. A falling tree will create vibrations in the air, which we call sound. Whether there is someone to see/hear it, or there isn't, is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Now, when you get down to the sub-atomic level, things work a bit different there.

Steve|`|IUmAflSqaa	You're right that nonzero divisors need not be units.  The easiest example is Z, since -1 and 1 are the only units.    As for your more general question...  that's a hard question, and a good one, too.  I don't know if it's known in general.  I'm sure there are some specific results for certain classes of rings, but I personally don't know.    For fun, your statement is true in the ring of nxn matrices over a field, that every nonzero divisor is a unit.  Rather, every matrix of nonzero determinant is a unit, and every matrix of zero determinant is a zero divisor.  (0 is an eigenvalue of a matrix A with det(A) = 0, so X divides the minimal polynomial p(X) of A, i.e. p(X) = Xq(X).  Then q(A)  0 and Aq(A) = p(A) = 0.)  And, whenever you can realize your ring as a subring of a direct product of rings of matrices over a field, then you get the same deal.  But this is pretty special.

Xv33QsESaa	Density = 840kg/m3 (or .840g/cm3 in relation to the density of the liquid in which it is floating)    You can figure this in multiple ways.  Below I will document the way my first Master taught me while studying balast planning for marine voyages.    To figure this, you need to know the total mass of the ship (this is equal to the density of the displaced liquid * the density of thte liquid) and the total volume of the ship.    The mass of the ship is equal to the mass of the water it displaces (takes the place of).  Calculate the volume of the submerged section of the ship (8m x 10m x 100m = 800cm x 1000cm x 10000cm = 8,000,000,000cm3) and then figure out what this volume of water would weight (density given as 1.050g/cm3- this is important as the density of water is not constant, fresh water is less dense than salt water), so (8,000,000,000cm3 x 1.050g/cm3 = 8,400,000,000g .    The total volume of the ship is a little simpler to calculate (10mx10mx100m = 10,000m3).    The density of the ship is is fugured by dividing the mass by the total volume (8,400,000,000g / 10,000m3 = 8,400,000g/m3 or 840kg/m3 or .840g/cm3).    Since .840g/cm3 is only 80% of the density of the total equivalent mass of the liquid it sets in, the ship floats with 80% of it's volume below the surface.  Less dense + no leaks in the hull = gotta float!|`|D5QgyGbXaa	The weight of the ship equals the weight of the volume of water displaced by the hull (Archimedes principle of bouyancy).  Volume of water equals 10mx8mx100m in (m^3 units)  Weight of water is 1.050 g/cm^3 x 100^3 cm^3/m^3 x Volume of water displaced (units in g, divide by 1000 for kg, divide by another 1000 for T (metric))  Density of ship is weight of water/volume of ship (total) in Kg/m^3 or g/cm^3 units|`|gCn6bXAFaa	The weight of the ship is equal to the weight of the displaced water. (10X100X8)  the density of the ship is its weight divided by its volume (given)

hHVMrnK3aa	In theory, when shares go ex-dividend, they drop by the amount of the dividend.  Typically this would be reflected in the opening price on that day.    So if the shares closed the previous day at $50,  then they would open the next day at $45.    But there is more to the market price of the shares than that.    The tax info you give suggests that a 'smart' investor would  sell the stock the day before, giving up the dividend,  hoping to capture it the next day for a tax-free gain.    That would artificially change the market for the shares,  so it might not follow the theoretical expectation.    If there was a lot of day-before selling, it might depress  the share price, and a lot of ex-dividend buying the next  day might inflate it.  As a result instead of a $5 dividend,  this 'smart' investor might net only a $3 gain.  That's not  as good as the $3.50 after-tax gain on the dividend.    The dividend payment date has no bearing at all -  it has nothing to do with who receives the dividend.  If you held the stock on the record date (the day  immediately preceding ex-dividend), you could have  sold it subsequently and you would still receive the  dividend, because you sold it ex-dividend (ex = "without").

k2iSDGauaa	you can't think of electrons as "particles." They are so small that they behave like what matter is made out of (energy), or in a way waves. If an atom has 8 electrons, the waves can fit in a certain way, but any more or less, they start "canceling out" in a way, so cannot physically fit in the orbitals around nuclei.  In theory there can be nearly infinite electrons around an atom, but there are areas of higher probability called orbitals, and to fit more would be to have them further away from the nucleus, which lowers the probability.|`|n7ZatrH0aa	The easiest way my teacher explained is because in the bohr model there are 8 electrons in the first 2 rings. Two in the first, six in the second. If an atom doesn't have these eight valence electrons it is unstable or an isotope and will have to share electrons with another molecule. Which brings you into covalent and ionic bonds.

California is a very long coastline, so the dates differ a bit depending on where you are.     In Southern California you can reliably spot whales from late December to mid-April.     Here is a page that shows the density of sightings from Pt. Vicente in Los Angeles County.    http://www.acs-la.org/GWCensus.htm    (Scroll down for the chart.)    There are other whales that can be spotted off the California coast. Humpback Whales come a bit later in the year and are regularly seen off of Santa Barbara from March thru July (and sporadically all over) and Blue Whales are seen off the Channel Islands from June to September. More recently Fin Whales have been spotted reliably in the Channel Islands area feeding.

Learn first aid.   Learn how to turn off the gas, water, and electricity.   Make up a plan of where to meet your family after an earthquake.   Don't leave heavy objects on shelves (they'll fall during a quake).   Anchor heavy furniture, cupboards, and appliances to the walls or floor.   Learn the earthquake plan at your school or workplace.     What to Do During an Earthquake:-  Stay calm! If you're indoors, stay inside. If you're outside, stay outside.   If you're indoors, stand against a wall near the center of the building, stand in a doorway, or crawl under heavy furniture (a desk or table). Stay away from windows and outside doors.   If you're outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall. Stay away from buildings (stuff might fall off the building or the building could fall on you).   Don't use matches, candles, or any flame. Broken gas lines and fire don't mix.   If you're in a car, stop the car and stay inside the car until the earthquake stops.   Don't use elevators (they'll probably get stuck anyway).     What to Do After an Earthquake:-  Check yourself and others for injuries. Provide first aid for anyone who needs it.   Check water, gas, and electric lines for damage. If any are damaged, shut off the valves. Check for the smell of gas. If you smell it, open all the windows and doors, leave immediately, and report it to the authorities (use someone else's phone).   Turn on the radio. Don't use the phone unless it's an emergency.   Stay out of damaged buildings.   Be careful around broken glass and debris. Wear boots or sturdy shoes to keep from cutting your feet.   Be careful of chimneys (they may fall on you).   Stay away from beaches. Tsunamis and seiches sometimes hit after the ground has stopped shaking.   Stay away from damaged areas.   If you're at school or work, follow the emergency plan or the instructions of the person in charge.   Expect aftershocks.     Hope that helps...|`|AA12139405	Read this.  PROTECTION DURING EARTHQUAKES    The following are some of the important precaution to be observed to save our life during an earthquake. Even though we do not have fool proof system to fore warn earthquakes some of the changes in nature or in the behaviors of animals and birds may help to decide the situations.    Before an earthquake.  Have a battery powered radio, flash light, and first aid kids in your house ,  Make sure every one knows where they are kept ,  Learn first aid; teach how to stop electric main and gas supply ,  Dont keep heavy objects in high shelves ,  Fasten heavy appliances to the floor, and anchor heavy furniture to the walls ,  Plan for your family for reuniting after an earthquake if anybody separated ,  Urge your school teachers to discuss earthquake safety in the class rooms, and ask them to conduct drills ,Keep some dry fruits and drinking water.   Find out your office has an emergency plan, know your responsibility at your works during an emergency .Keep some dry fruits and drinking water .    During an earthquake.  Stay calm if you are indoors, stay out if you are out of buildings. Many injuries occur as people enter or leave the buildings.  If you are indoors , stand against the a wall near the center of the building, or get under a sturdy table  keep some cushion on your head, Stay away from windows and outside doors, if you are in a high rise building stand against a support column.  If you are in outdoor  stay in the open place , keep away from over head electric wires. and bridges,  Dont use open flames, if you are in a moving vehicle stop away from over bridges and stay inside the vehicle still earthquake stops.    After an earthquake.  Check yourself and nearby people for injury, provide first aid,  Check electric and gas connection,  Turn on your radio or T.V for emergency instructions, reduce the use of phone lines it may be required for conveying some important messages.  Stay out of damaged buildings,  Wear chapels and gloves to protect against shattered glass and debris.     Stay away from beaches and water front areas where Tsunami could strike, even long after the shaking has stopped.  Have one earthquake alarm fixed in your house.

A pair of chromosomes, one inherited from each parent, that have corresponding gene sequences and that pair during meiosis.     Alleles are different forms of the same gene eg. in the ABO blood group there are 3 alleles (ABO) and everyone has two - eg AA,AO,BB,BO,AB, or OO.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Homologous chromosomes ARE regular chromosomes.  They are chromosomes that have the same arrangement of genes.  You get 23  chromosomes from your father and 23 from your mother.  The longest one from each parent is called  1.  These two  1 chromosomes form a homologous pair, because they have the same genes on them.  The same is true for the  2 chromosomes and all the way down the line, for 22 homologous pairs;  the X and Y are considered only partially homologous.    A gene is a place on a chromosome that produces a protein or polypeptide.  An allele is one form of that gene.  For example, a gene may produce a protein to produce Flower Color, but an allele produces red or purple or yellow flowers.    Here is an idea using both concepts:  human chromosome  1 has a gene for the Rh blood type, but one alle that may appear there produces the antigen and the other allele that may appear there doesn't.  So you have 2 alleles, because you have a homologous pair of chromosome  1.|`|BeFneHRgaa	Oh I'm doing this in school at the moment too.    I have no freakin clue.

i0ypGmlQaa	Let S denote your sum.    Then    3S = 3 / (14) + 3/(25) + .... 1/(n(n+3))    And by the verification,    3S = 1/1 -1/4 + 1/2 - 1/5 + 1/3 - 1/6 + 1/4 - 1/7 + ... + 1/n - 1/(n+3)    So anyway, it converges, so does S, and you know:    3S = 1/1 -1/4 + 1/2 - 1/5 + 1/3 - 1/6 + 1/4 - 1/7 + ...  + 1/n - 1/(n+3)    Rearranging lets you cancel out EVERYTHING except the first and last three terms:    3S = 1/1 +1/2 + 1/3 - 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+2) - 1/(n+3)    Simplify:    3S = 11/6 - 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+2) - 1/(n+3)    S = (1/3) ( 11/6 - 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+2) - 1/(n+3) )    Done.    -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------     This also works for the infinite sum of these terms, but with a little more to say. If you don't know infinite sums, you can ignore this part of the answer, but maybe you will find it interesting. Now let:    S = 1/(1 x 4) + 1/(2 x 5) + ... [infinite sum]    You can rearrange terms of this sequence ONLY if it converges. You must first test for convergence. By the comparison test, you can show this since:    S =  1/(m(m+3))     If you don't know that it's 2/6, fine, but it converges because it is a p-series with p>1.    So like above, we are allowed to rearrange, and the terms cancel except the first three terms (there are no "last three" left over at all):    3S = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 11/6    Giving the infinite sum as:    S = 11/18    This is an example of a telescoping series that requires rearrangement.

x1CcZBENaa	From a philosophical point of view, it might be said that the most important function of the brain is to serve as the physical structure underlying the mind. From a biological point of view, though, the most important function is to generate behaviors that promote the welfare of an animal. Brains control behavior either by activating muscles, or by causing secretion of chemicals such as hormones. Even single-celled organisms may be capable of extracting information from the environment and acting in response to it.[1] Sponges, which lack a central nervous system, are capable of coordinated body contractions and even locomotion.[2] In vertebrates, the spinal cord by itself contains neural circuitry capable of generating reflex responses as well as simple motor patterns such as swimming or walking.[3] However, sophisticated control of behavior on the basis of complex sensory input requires the information-integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.<br>  <br>  Despite rapid scientific progress, much about how brains work remains a mystery. The operations of individual neurons and synapses are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate in ensembles of thousands or millions has been very difficult to decipher. Methods of observation such as EEG recording and functional brain imaging tell us that brain operations are highly organized, but these methods do not have the resolution to reveal the activity of individual neurons. Thus, even the most fundamental principles of neural network computation may to a large extent remain for future investigators to discover.[4]|`|Xd1Vy42Raa	a nucleus in the posterior parietal cortex (area PEG) in the hemisphere opposite the reaching hand

K5KSeqTVaa	The Zimmerman Telegram (or Zimmerman Note; German: ; Spanish: Telegram Zimmerman) was a coded telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, Arthur Zimmerman, on January 16, 1917, to the German ambassador in Washington, Johann von Bernstorff, at the height of World War I. On January 19, Bernstorff, per Zimmermann's request, forwarded the Telegram to the German ambassador in Mexico, Heinrich von Eckardt. Zimmermann sent the Telegram in anticipation of the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare by the German Empire on February 1, an act which German High Command feared would draw the neutral United States into war on the side of the Allies. The Telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the United States appeared likely to enter the war he was to approach the Mexican government with a proposal for military alliance. He was to offer Mexico material aid in the reclamation of territory lost during the Mexican-American War, specifically the American states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Eckardt was also instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan.<br>  <br>  The Zimmermann Telegram was intercepted and decoded by the British cryptographers of Room 40. The revelation of its contents in the American press on March 1 caused public outrage that contributed to the United States' declaration of war against Germany and its allies on April 6.

OXsRXLx1aa	I'm not sure about creating gems specifically, but a metallurgical engineer is someone who focuses on improving material structure (crystalline lattice structures); especially in metals. Their jobs are to create improved metals by spiking the iron (or other base metals) with carbon and other impurities to add strength or heat resistance. They can also tell you how the molecules rearrange themselves at different temperatures. The same principles go into forming diamonds in the laboratory so I don't see why a metallurgical engineer wouldn't work with them.<br>  <br>  Look for companies that currently use diamonds in industrial applications. As manufactured diamonds used for jewelry are a very small fraction of their use, a company that uses them for grinding wheels or cutting instruments would be much more likely to have engineers* (metallurgical engineers) for creation of diamonds, especially in large batches.<br>  <br>  For sizing and molding jewelry it is more of a specific niche of jobs that you really have to be into. As far as moneymaking, all because you haven't heard much about it doesn't mean it doesn't pay well.

iaCfBwaSaa	Palisade cells are a type of leaf tissues and can be found within the mesophyll in leaves of dicotyledonous plants. They contain chloroplasts, which convert the energy stored in photons to chemical energy through photosynthesis.<br>  <br>  Palisade cells show various adaptations: first, their cylindrical shape, which allows maximum absorption of light by chloroplasts. Second, these facinating cells produce carbohydrates in greater quantities than are needed by each cell; these carbohydrates are fed into a wide variety of metabolic pathways and are vital to the functioning of the plant. Third, the palisade mesophyll contains the largest number of chloroplasts per cell in the plant; usually positioned towards the upper surface of the leaf in order to harness the greatest amount of energy possible.<br>  <br>  Palisade cells are placed all over the top of a leaf, maximising the extent of light absorption. As a result, the top of a leaf is often darker than the bottom.<br>  <br>  Palisade cells are grouped together to give the palisade layer of the leaf- this is the leaf tissue where most of the photosynthesis takes place.<br>  <br>  Light absorption and photosynthesis is carried out by the chlorophyll, and it is these that give leaves a green pigment. The cell wall helps the cell keep its shape, and the membrane lets certain substances in and out while being permeable to water. All the deoxyribosenucleic acid (DNA) and genetic information of the cell is stored in the nucleus. It is the 'brain' or control centre of the cell, and (in simple terms) tells the cell what to do. In the cytoplasm chemical reactions take place, including the breaking down of glycogen, the cell's food.The palisade cells also stores glucose as starch a storing sugar.

So, now, people are confused and are wondering what they predicted. The end of the world? Highly doubt it, I say it was just the end of their calendar. Its also possible, they just got tired of making the calendar.

You need to look at a granite and describe the different minerals you can see.<br>  <br>  A basalt is a lot tougher because the size of the minerals is often too small to see with the naked eye.

FLgDn3OTaa	Well, if you want the truth shark attacks are very few and far between- there are less than 100 recorded fatalities per year, which may seem surprising considering how often you may read about it in the news.<br>  <br>  But it is important to remember that this is because they ARE rare. Sharks do not like the taste of humans, as we are rather bony and unpleasant. A shark would much prefer a nice, juicy sea-lion. The only place where shark attacks are common are places where people frequently dive into cages surrounded by sharks. This is a deathwish because it teaches the sharks that humans are an easy food source. But in high risk areas there are usually warning signs, so just obey these and you'll be fine. The film Jaws is not a good depiction of the species in general, and it gives sharks an undeservably bad reputation.<br>  <br>  Surfers are most at risk, but even then, the risk is very, very small and there are plenty of places to surf which are shark-free. More people are killed by donkeys than sharks per year.|`|fc8DuwHaaa	My advice: Face your fear. Find out everything you can about the Great White and i guarantee, you will go from fear to awe in a short amount of time. I don't blame you for being afraid of these animals, but Jaws was fiction, not reality. I felt the way you feel now, although not quite as extreme, but the more I saw and read about the Great White, the more I began to admire and respect this magnificent animal. There is nothing else on this entire planet quite like the Great White shark.<br>  I Hope that helps.|`|85TWIOyraa	Funny! You do realise that sharks are water creatures and you are on land, right?

The deeper this fear, the stronger the impact of the film, and sadly the greater the psychological damage.<br>  <br>  "Alien" had quite an effect on me because of the gruesome special effects. The notion of monsters living inside people and then tearing their bodies apart cost me a lot of sleep. A friend of mine suggested I try and ask myself exactly what it was that frightened me so much. Deep introspection revealed it was a fear of the loss of self control. Reflecting back over my life, this indeed has been a cause of much personal humiliation, such as getting sick in front of friends.<br>  <br>  I then reflected on the movie itself and realized how this fear was cleverly inserted into the film. Most horror movies in which people get dismembered by monsters living inside them typically are isolated and live in cramped quarters. Basically, this is a depiction of "cabin fever" with a heavy dose of poetic license. <br>  <br>  Now that I realized this, that awful thing sticking out of the astronauts chest was just a piece of yellow rubber, not the manifestation of my darkest fears. It also probably was why I was able to watch Carpenter's "the thing" with little effect, although this film was far gorier than "Alien". <br>  <br>  Frankly, I avoid horror films as a rule. Alien was a mistake because I thought it was going to be like "Star Trek". Perhaps after is all said and done, maybe this was a good thing in the long run. It forced me to face myself although it was about as pleasant as shock therapy.<br>  <br>  Therefore, I suggest you forget the shark itself and ask yoursel what the shark represents. "Jaws" used a fairly old story line - monsters lurking in the shadows have been around ever since those old 1950's "B" movies. Back then, everybody in America feared the outside world, Russia in particular. This country is also known to have a rather isolated, self centered lifestyle, so maybe that shark is nothing but the average American's fear of strangers. <br>  <br>  However, don't take my word for this. It's up to you to discover what part of yourself the shark represents. Find it and face it - it's the only way to get a good night's sleep.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps !|`|bY8iv5rwaa	Great white sharks are the most deadly animals in the sea, but it doesnt however mean that they are to be feared.  There are VERY few greatwhite attacks per year throughout the entire world.  I think its less than 20!  But these animals are magnificent.  They are one of the oldest surviving things in the ocean and as long as we respect them and stay out of their way, they won't mess with us.  Really, if you watch movies like JAWS, or Deep Blue Sea (mako sharks...not great whites), then of COURSE its going to be scary!  its a HORROR movie!  but  there is nothing to worry about!  stuff like that doesnt happen in real life!  Hippos are way scarrier!  think about hippos!  at least that will take your mind off the sharks!  :)|`|4N9uc68vaa	well your mind knows that you don't want to think about it so it thinks about it  but the best thing to do is to do something really fun.This has happened to me before....|`|AA10306863	You should try rerecording the movie minus the scary parts. It is a very good movie in keeping with the times. Great white sharks are dangerous but there are actually more common and numerous species of sharks that are more likely to bite you then they are. California, Australia, see more great whites. But in air and sea disasters it is usually the oceanic white-tip and the blue sharks that seem to be circling, waiting, probing, not the great white.

It's the visibility of the world that would cease to exist.<br>  <br>  You see, light is emitted form its source.  Physical objects absorb some of that light, but reflect the remainder of the spectrum.  The light which is not absorbed gives us the color of the object.  Example Given:  A Black object absorbs all the light that strikes it.  However, if light is emitted and a human observer is looking straight at the light-source, then the object which is emitting light would be the only visible object.|`|mCbChkKraa	It exists objectively, however, cannot be seen/detected without reflection.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Sure.<br>  <br>  How do you think the light from distant stars gets to earth?|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	Yes it exists it is just not visible.|`|9fdb8309a82d0fd5cf22e900d46f7662aa	Light does not need to reflect.<br>  Light waves can be transmitted through a medium, or absorbed by certain materials and changed to heat,  or reflected.<br>  In space the sun light goes on forever until it comes to a surface to light up.

RbhLzK9vaa	well amoebas move using extensions of their cytoplasm called pseudopods. Some protists use flagella, or long tail-like cytoskeleton extensions, to move. Other protists, such as paramecia, use cilia, which are like flagella, but shorter, and there are usually more of them. Squids move using jet propulsion. Obviously, bird move by flight, and their anatomy accommodates it by consisting of hollow bones, extra air sacs, and feathers (which are modified reptilian scales!).

nuhi9H6paa	Everything needs some type of energy to exist. It fuels our bodies in the form of food. I agree that other life may not need the same energy to exist...but any life including bacteria needs something to fuel its existence. <br>  <br>  Although hard evidence for this has not yet been found, most cosmologists tend to believe that some form of life is bound to exist somewhere in the universe. This belief rests on the fact that there are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. There remains a very significant possibility of life existing somewhere else. The exact form of life that can exist is a matter of speculation – it need not be carbon and oxygen-based like it is on earth. Moreover, these life forms may or may not have evolved intelligence, as we know it.<br>  <br>  Aliens need not look like us to resemble us in more fundamental ways. Consider that the four most common elements in the Universe are hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen. Helium is inert. The three most abundant, chemically active ingredients in the cosmos are also the top three ingredients in life on Earth. For this reason, you can bet that if life is found on another planet, it will be made of a similar mix of elements. <br>  <br>  Conversely, if life on Earth were composed primarily of, for example, molybdenum, bismuth, and plutonium, then we would have excellent reason to suspect that we were something special in the Universe.|`|68l1TeDjaa	nobody knows anything about aliens. how would we know if they need water, air and sun? they may not need anything!!! we dont know that. we dont even know if there is life out there! they are still studying it. i mean im sure they would need something to survive. but honestly how woudl we know?|`|KkDTGuAXaa	All living organisms need something to sustain them.

The masses of the three reactants are given in scientific notation, probably to indicate that each one is measured to three significant figures.  For convenience, we will convert them to regular notation of 500. g propelene (propene), 5.00. g ammonia and 1,000 g of oxygen.<br>  <br>  Let's assume that propene (C3H6) is a limiting reactant, and then calculate the number of grams of ammonia needed to react completely with 500. g of propene using dimensional analysis and the equation coefficients:<br>  <br>  [(500. g C3H6)/1][(1 mol C3H6)/(42.081 g C3H6)][(2 mol NH3)(2 mol C3H6)][(17.031 g NH3)/(1 mol NH3)] = 202 g NH3 needed<br>  <br>  Since 500. g of NH3 is available, and only 202 g are needed, NH3 is clearly in excess.<br>  <br>  Next, calculate the number of grams of oxygen needed to react completely with 500. g of propene using dimensional analysis and the equation coefficients:<br>  <br>  [(500. g C3H6)/1][(1 mol C3H6)/(42.081 g C3H6)][(3 mol O2)(2 mol C3H6)][(31.998 g O2)/(1 mol O2)] = 570 g O2 needed<br>  <br>  Since 1,000 g of O2 is available, and only 570 g is needed, O2 is clearly in excess.<br>  <br>  Since both ammonia and oxygen are in excess, propene is the limiting reactant that determines the amount of the product acrylonitrile that can be produced.<br>  <br>  Next, calculate the number of grams of acrylonitrile that can be produced from 500. g of propene using dimensional analysis and the equation coefficients:<br>  <br>  [(500. g C3H6)/1][(1 mol C3H6)/(42.081 g C3H6)][(2 mol C3H3N)(2 mol C3H6)][(53.064 g C3H3N)/(1 mol C3H3N)] = 630. g C3H3N produced<br>  <br>  Answer:  6.30 x 10^2 g of acrylonitrile can be produced from a mixture of 5.00 x 102 g propylene, 5.00 x 102 g ammonia, and 1.00 x 103 g oxygen.|`|PvVs4VIzaa	first you have to determine which is the limiting reactants by comparing the number of moles of the substances you have<br>  <br>  number of moles of C3H6 = 5*10^2 / (12.01*3 + 6.06) =11.88 moles<br>  number of moles of NH3  = 5*10^2 / (14.0+3.03) = 29.36 moles<br>  number of moles of O2     = 1.00*10^3 / (32.0) = 31.25 moles<br>  <br>  from the balanced equation, 2 moles of C3H6 react with 2 moles of NH3 and 3 moles of O2 to produce 2 moles of C3H3N and 6 moles of H2O<br>  <br>  from these you can deduce that C3H6 is the limiting reactants.<br>  <br>  mass of C3H3N produced =  11.88 * (12.01*3+3.03+14.0) = 630.35g<br>  mass of H2O produced = 11.88*3 * (2.02+16.0) = 642.23g<br>  <br>  mass of NH3 left = (29.36-11.88) * (14.0+3.03) = 297.68g<br>  mass of O2 left = [31.25-(3*11.88/2)] * (32.0) = 429.76g|`|W0uXQZxSaa	The first thing to do is to convert all of the reactant masses to moles:<br>  <br>  for C3H6 (MW=42 g/mol):  500g * (1 mol/42 g) = 11.90 mol<br>  for NH3 (MW = 17 g/mol):  500g * (1 mol/17 g) = 29.41 mol<br>  for O2 (MW = 32 g/mol):  1000g * (1 mol/32 g) = 31.25 mol<br>  <br>  Now to answer how much C3H3N is produced you need to look at the reaction ratios between the reactants and C3H3N to determine which is the limiting reactant:<br>  <br>  For C3H6 to C3H3N ratio is 2:2 or 11.9 mol C3H6 gives 11.9 mol C3H3N<br>  For NH3 to C3H3N ratio is 2:2 or 29.41 mol NH3 gives 29.41 mol C3H3N<br>  for O2 to C3H3N ratio is 3:2 and to figure out how much C3H3N is made set up a proportion<br>  (3 mol O2/2 mol C3H3N) = (31.25 mol O2/x mol C3H3N)<br>  solving for x gives 20.83 mol C3H3N<br>  <br>  From the above the limiting reactant is C3H6 because is gives the least amount of C3H3N.  Now you know that a 100% yield will give 11.9 mol of C3H3N so to answer the question convert the mol of C3H3N to mass.<br>  <br>  To answer the question regarding water, the ratio of C3H6 to H2O is 2:6 or 1:3 so there will be 3 times the amount of water produced than C3H6 reacted, so 11.9 * 3 = 35.7 mol of water or 642.6 g<br>  <br>  To figure out how much of the starting reactants are left there will be zero C3H6 and the other ones you need to set up proportions again.<br>  <br>  For NH3 the ratio with C3H6 is 2:2 so if 11.9 mol of C3H6 is consumed there will be 11.9 mol of NH3 comsumed, and the starting amount of NH3 was 29.41, so 29.41 mol - 11.9 mol = 17.51 mol of NH3 left (convert to mass = 297.7 g)<br>  For O2 the ratio with C3H6 is 2:3 so if 11.9 mol of C3H6 is consumed the proportion to determine O2 consumed is:<br>  (2 mol C3H6/3 mol O2) = (11.9 mol C3H6/x mol O2 consumed)<br>  solving for x gives 17.85 mol of O2 consumed; therefore the amount of O2 left will be 31.25 mol - 17.85 =13.4 mol O2 left (convert to mass gives 428.8 g O2 left)<br>  <br>  hope you can follow this.|`|836vtf9Saa	Lil' Wayne|`|6MHuI3NXaa	god... im dumb.|`|0jMTJjwYaa	...ok?|`|AA11591717	Do no ask homework questions here!!!

If these survivors bounce back, then the resulting new infection will be stronger than the old one <br>  <br>  ... evolution has occurred, in your body ... in a matter of 1 or 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Remember, evolution just means "change in the inherited traits of a population" ... it does not require evolution into another species ... it does not even require new mutations.  If 10% of the bacteria in your body have some gene X that makes them slightly more resistant to the antibiotics, and by stopping the antibiotics too soon you end up with an infection where 80% of the bacteria in your body have that gene X ... then that change from 10% to 80% is evolution, by definition.|`|3BGJETHYaa	Bacteria resistance is good, and there have been other dramatic events within years in visible animals.

Nk3eQbM7aa	1. Samples are usually injected as a pure liquid or in solution (If the GC is connected to a mass spectrometer for GCMS, the samples are fairly dilute solutions)<br>  <br>  2. As in all chromatography, different components of a sample will have a different affinity for the mobile phase (in this case, gas) and the stationary phase (in the column).  For instance, something like a large organic acid will spend less time in the gas phase, and take longer to go through the column, while something like a low molecular wieght hydrocarbon will spend lots of time in the gas phase and move the column fairly quickly.
DgHXaCfraa	12. You know that 4x = 3y because they are both diagonals.<br>  So y= (4x)/3. Just divide both sides by 3. <br>  <br>  You also know 3x-5 = x + y, subtract x on both sides, and you get<br>  y = 2x - 5. <br>  <br>  Now since both are equal to y, you set the two equations equal to each other: (4x)/3 = 2x - 5<br>  <br>  4x = 6x-15<br>  -2x = -15<br>  x= 7.5 <br>  <br>  Plug that in for y: y = (4x)/3 = [4(7.5)]/3 = 10<br>  <br>  So your answer is x = 15/2 or 7.5 and y = 10.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this help.

To compensate for the leading recative power of the lines, we provide a recator with lagging recative power.|`|AA10133800	In long EHV transmission lines, the line becomes highly capacitive.

X0eTmgEQaa	Put simply, the domain is all the numbers you can put into a function and the range is all the possible numbers that can come out of the function.<br>  <br>  Take the function x = y + 1, if your domain were 1 < y < 3 (as your question states above), then y can take any value between but not equal to 1 and 3. But if we put y = 3 into our function we get:<br>  <br>  x = 3 + 1 = 4<br>  <br>  Similarly if we put y = 1 into the function we get:<br>  <br>  x = 1 + 1 = 2<br>  <br>  These two numbers give us the highest and lowest numbers that could result from the domain we have been given. So x will always be between but not equal to 2 and 4 i.e. our range is 2 < x < 4.<br>  <br>  Note: Usually however you should note that the domain usually looks at x-values and the range looks at y-values, but I tailored my example for your question. So usually the function would be y = x +1 and not x = y +1, as in the above example.|`|KHjYq2bHaa	Is there more information besides that?<br>  <br>  I always thought that the domain are the x-values and range for the y-values.|`|7e963653d931f417ceeeda7ebe5f5fb6aa	The domain is the scope of y values you are allowing to be accepted by a function, ie what goes in.<br>  <br>  The range is the corresponding values that the function (x(y)) will return, ie what comes out.<br>  <br>  A function x(y) = y+1, 1<y<3 would satisfy the above.

If n is a prime number, then it is the product of 1, which is a prime number, and itself. Therefore the statement holds true.<br>  If n is not a prime number, then it is a product of two positive integers, say p and q. Since both p and q are smaller than n, by the induction hypothesis they can be written as the product of prime numbers. Hence n can also be written as the product of prime numbers.

He then took a glass prism and placed it in the sunbeam. The result was a spectacular multicolored band of light just like a rainbow. The multicolored band of light is called a color spectrum. Newton believed that all the colors he saw were in the sunlight shining into his room. He thought he then should be able to combine the colors of the spectrum and make the light white again. To test this, he placed another prism upside-down in front of the first prism. He was right. The band of colors combined again into white sunlight.

A7Z0mmO1aa	Yes! Intitutively, the farther the object is from the axis of rotation, the higher the moment of inertia. A very easy way to internalize this is, if you sit on a rotating chair, and set yourself in circular motion, and extend and contract your legs. When your legs are farther out, you have higher moment of inertia and hence lower angular velocity. As you pull your legs in, you will start spinning faster.<br>  <br>  Since both objects have same mass and density, the hemisphere will have a larger radius and greater percentage of it's mass away from the axis of rotation than the sphere (This is assuming that the axis of rotation is normal to the cut face of the hemisphere)
DRVSCxKpaa	Salt is extracted by two methods:<br>  <br>  Deposits of salt may be mined, and those deposits are of two types:<br>  - underground or open pit mines extracting bulk salt from underground deposits<br>  - Extraction of salt from dry saline salt beds of salt lakes.<br>  <br>  The most common method however, is to extract salt by evaporating sea water in large, shallow basins, each several acres in size.  Countries that have hot, dry summers are ideal such as South Australia.<br>  <br>  Rock mined from a deposit is called 'rock salt'. and salt evaporated from the sea is called 'sea salt'<br>  <br>  Some environmental issues include:<br>  -disposal of waste material from a salt mine<br>  - use of large areas to establish sea water evaporation basins<br>  - displacement of wildlife|`|HRJDrnBRaa	Distillation, Desalinization, Reverse Osmosis|`|GI0Mkzwzaa	There are two methods: the first by mining and the second by evaporation.

4qvrm5xQaa	Some ideas:<br>  <br>  1) A bundle of noodles is stronger than a single noodle.<br>  <br>  Create the beams/struts by bundling a bunch of noodles (like 6 or 7) together with a single marshmallow.  [Take the bundle and push the marshmallow to the midpoint of the length of the bundle.  The marshmallow holds the bundle together like a loose rubber band.]<br>  <br>  2) Triangles make for strong, stable structures.<br>  <br>  Squares are easier to work with, but if you include a single diagonal (to divide the square into two triangles) it becomes stronger.  If you can manage to include both diagonals (to form an X in the square) it is even stronger.<br>  <br>  3) To make stronger joints, consider using heat to melt marshmallows into a goo, apply the goo to the joint, then chill the joint/goo to make it hard.<br>  <br>  Think of Rice Krispie treats: soft and gooey -- that's melted marshmallow with butter diluting it to keep it fluid.  Put that treat in the fridge, and it gets really hard, but not terribly brittle.<br>  <br>  Exploit that behavior in your construction: use soft marshmallows to connect the beams/struts and create the structure.  As you finalize each joint, pour/paint the melted (but cooling) marshmallow on the node to stiffen it up.  Then store the final structure in the fridge before the earthquake test to ensure hardened joints.|`|is4hA8eUaa	OH GOD! not the noodle and marshmallow assignment! it's been done everywhere... boring! Anyway, just look up what everyone does at: <a href="http://www.scsc.k12.in.us/SMS/Teachers/Elliot/Spaghetti%20Earthquake%20WebQuest/Spaghetti%20EQ%20WebQuest%20-%20Notes%20to%20Teachers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scsc.k12.in.us/SMS/Teachers/E...</a><br>  <br>  Something different. Mash a few marshmallows and roll it out as a sheet (make sure you have some flour down first so it doesn't stick to the surface). Make two flat sheets of marshmallow, one should be thicker to serve as the base, the other should be thinner to serve as the roof - cut them out into a square. Get some other marshmallows and slice them up into thin discs. Take some noodles and break them in half. Plant 4 bundles of half-noodles into the thick marshmallow sheet to serve as corner posts of your building. Break the full length noodles for cross bracing between the posts making X in the middle (<a href="http://www.ideers.bris.ac.uk/resistant/strength_brace_cross.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.ideers.bris.ac.uk/resistant/s...</a> Sandwich two marshmallow discs around the intersection of the cross bracing, lightly pinching them together. Break more noodles to span the top of each post, again sandwich the discs around these corners to wrap it tightly. Now cross brace the top. At this point you should have a box shape with 5 cross-braced surfaces. Put the roof on top.<br>  <br>  You can be done with just a one story building but that's no fun. Repeat the steps to make another module and place it on top of the other module, pinch the marshmallow sheets between each module to glue them together. After adding the second story, buddy up the full length noodles against the 4 posts using the marshmallow discs to hold them together. This step makes the two modules one solid piece.<br>  <br>  Now here is the most important part. It's time for the quake table, flatten a layer if noodles on the table wider than the base of the structure then place the structure on top. This will make the structure slide to reduce the lateral shake. Here you are trying to demonstrate "foundation isolation" - meaning the foundation is allowed to shift. (whereas rigid foundations transfer all the quake energy into the walls)<br>  <br>  Have fun!

tAWkYoWJaa	I would try onions, it is super easy!!<br>  <br>  You take a small piece of onion and cut it up into tiny, tiny little pieces (you have to cut it up really small so that it is easier and faster to access the DNA). <br>  <br>  Place this in a small cup or bowl, unless you have test tubes. Add a small drop of dish detergent and a pinch of salt. Make sure you mix this together really well. <br>  <br>  Since the cell has a protective coating around it, you need the dish soap to break down the protein in the coating. Once the cell lining has broken down, the DNA will be exposed. <br>  <br>  DNA is also negatively charged, so the salt (which is positively charged) will make the DNA neutral (no charge). This is important because if the DNA was still electrically charged, it may react with other DNA or react with something in the mixture you have created (for example, it may react with a component in the soap). <br>  <br>  Let this sit for a few minutes, (you can add some rubbing alcohol to speed things up) and you will soon be able to see some white strands forming in the solution. The white strands are the DNA. You can take them out by using a tooth pick and hooking it under one of the strands. Try to isolate one strand so you don't just get a big glob of white goop. (I have also tried apples, strawberries, chick peas, potatoes, etc) All of these should work, but some (like the onions) work better than others.|`|mTPEEaOraa	see talk like an eighth grader even i am an eighth grader.So i can know what's going on in your mind my better suggestion would be to search a simpler,specific and an eye-catching project on google!!|`|k0hhiATsaa	i'd say pick a simpler project that will yield more visual wow<br>  <br>  as awesome as it sounds|`|oyjP2zl0aa	Extracting DNA is not as easy as it sounds.

Why pay for something you don't need? And from where would you get all that hydrogen to power the fuel cells? Not to mention the cost to install DC to AC inverters (fuel cells produce direct current) and maintain all that stuff. Plug and play for now, it's so much easier and less expensive than high-tech pie in the sky.<br>  <br>  Along the same line of reasoning, you also are not likely to see hydrogen fuel cells powering transportation any time in the near future, as long as gasoline and diesel remains relatively inexpensive and readily available. If it ain't broke (yet) don't fix it.|`|oXPDFw4daa	A great deal of work has been done toward development of fuel cell technology, and home applications are possible.  But there are some limitations.<br>  <br>  First, the optimum fuel cell design uses hydrogen.  Hydrogen is not yet a practical energy source - there is no commercial hydrogen distribution system, fuel management for hydrogen presents significant technical issues (which is why hydrogen-fueled cars are a long way off), and the economics of hydrogen are not really favorable - it takes a lot of energy to make hydrogen (by electrolysis), and that production energy translates into losses at the macro level.  The fuels cells are are commercially available use natural gas rather than hydrogen, and are less efficient than hydrogen-based fuel cells.<br>  <br>  Second, fuel cell produce DC.  We can easily use DC for things like residential lighting, but for appliances, we need AC.  To convert DC to AC requires inverters - which add to the capital cost of the installation and therefore make the economics less favorable.  Furthermore, inverters have a problem with some appliance loads - specifically, in order to start the motors in refrigerator compressors, furnace blowers, well pumps, etc, an inverter must be sized several times larger than is required for the steady-state load in the home.  Another hit on the economics.  A way around this is to operate the inverter in parallel with a grid source so that the grid takes the 'impact" of starting those motors, but in that case the economics of the fuel cell source are even less favorable.<br>  <br>  This is not to say that hydrogen-based fuel cells can't happen - but rather that more work is needed to address some of the technical issues, and incentives are needed to overcome the economic hurdles.|`|7dxdpq8saa	Call this company in Connecticut.<br>  <br>  Contact: Peg Hashem <br>  1 860 727 2093<br>  peg.hashem@utcpower.com Download this Release<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Samsung Everland to Install 12 UTC Power Fuel Cell Systems for GS Power in South Korea<br>  <br>  SEOUL, South Korea (Oct. 29, 2008) – UTC Power, a United Technologies Corp.

D4XWrwuaaa	The painter spiral on the engine is there for a very important reason. It is visable when the engine is not turning, but diappears when the engine is turning.  So it helps as a warning to ground crews.  When they can not see the spiral, the engine is still turning too fast for them to approach the engine. Once they can see the spiral, then it is safe for them to get close to the engine without getting sucked into it.

AA11058044	Just some clarifications to the above answer:  it is correct that they are likely overwintering in your home - ladybird beetles seek shelter under leaves, in hollows and burrows and such to spend the winter months, and have adapted well to using human habitation for this purpose.  They get into cracks and crevices around the foundation in the fall.  If there's a warm day, some of them will wake up and start wandering around.  This is likely what you are seeing.<br>  <br>  However, the correct term for them isn't "ladybug" - that is one of their common names, but it's technically incorrect as they are not in the group known as the "true bugs".  Ladybird, or ladybird beetle is correct.<br>  <br>  Also, they don't eat dead bugs.  They eat live bugs.  Their favourite food is aphids, which makes them much beloved by gardeners, and they are often used for biological control in greenhouses.|`|Gt8NoO2waa	I think you mean Ladybugs, during the winter they attract towards each other by means of pheramones, where they form a sort of ball to keep each other warm. If you go under your house you may find one of these Ladybug balls, when there are active (spring,summer, and fall) they are attracted to dead insects, which is there main diet.
efe48b2704958e20b36597e1775c5058aa	Yes, the heat first passes into the water by conduction through the metal of the pan or heating element.<br>  The water as it gains heat, begins to rise as it's Density Decreases. (The water begins to expand). <br>  As the column of warmer water rises, cooler water from the top and sides moves in to replace it and, in turn is heated and rises.<br>  This continues and gets more 'violent' as the water becomes hotter and the Convection currents thus set up produce a Circulatory motion within the liquid.<br>  Eventually, the action becomes very strong and the water takes on a 'Rolling' motion as bubbles of steam form causing the 'Seething' action of boiling water.<br>  <br>  This is also the process that takes place in the atmosphere due to the warming of the Earth's surface by the Sun.<br>  The Lower Density heated air rises, cool air moves in, is heated and rises...and so-on. The Convection Currents set up are called 'Thermals' upon which birds, gliders, hang-gliders depend to obtain the required 'Lift'.<br>  A Hot-air balloon is an example of 'Forced Convection' using the hot air and gases produced from the combustion of Propane to fill the balloon with lighter (less dense) air to obtain the Lift.|`|xnrGBXHcaa	Yes it is. The water at the bottom of the pan gets hot first while the water at the top is still cool. The hot water rises to the top forcing the cool water down where it gets heated. This up and down motion is a convection current. Boiling occurs at all points in the fluid. Not just at the surface.|`|GI0Mkzwzaa	Yes, it is an example. Imagine that there are two layers of water in the part. As the fire heats the lower layer,the molecules tend to go far from each other and makes the lower layer float, as hot air floats a hot air balloon. The upper layer (which is colder) is forced down. And it is the next one to be heated. The previously lower layer is now somewhat cooled and the previously upper layer will be less dense than the previously lower layer. Hotter liquids are less dense than colder ones. For short, imagine the two layers rotating again & again. Heat is transferred through a medium, which is water, and that makes it an example of convection...|`|ROPLbLW9aa	no. the spreading pattern of the heat throughout the boiling chamber is the convection. but yes the water is heated by convection
Ew6A68mOaa	I have never heard that one but I don't believe it. The more layers you have on your bed the more insulation you will have on top of your body. Piling blankets on yourself has the same effect. Eventually you will get so warm you begin to sweat to cool off but the sweat won't be able to evaporate underneath of the comforters so you will end up soaking your bed. As far as I think, that saying doesn't make much sense logically but there might be other factors that I'm missing. Why don't you try testing this at your house by piling several blankets or comforters on top of yourself and see what happens.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	I don't think that's true.

Remember, the equation for this form is:<br>  <br>  y= mx + b<br>  <br>  'm' is slope, and 'b' is y-intercept. To solve for slope, simply look at 'b'.<br>  <br>  y= -2/3x + 4<br>  m= -2/3<br>  <br>  y= 3/2x - 3<br>  m= 3/2<br>  <br>  This is the easiest way to find slope; the only this one must watch out for is that 'y' doesn't have a number in front of it, or you need to divide both sides of the equation with that first. <br>  <br>  The last equation is in standard form:<br>  <br>  ax + by = c<br>  <br>  So, to solve this easiest, you need to solve so that it is in slope-intercept form, like above. To do this, one y needs to be on one side of the equation, alone. <br>  <br>  x + 2y = -4<br>  <br>  To get y alone, get rid of x through subtraction:<br>  <br>  2y= -x -4<br>  <br>  You need to have only one y, with no numbers in front of it, as I mentioned above. So, divide by 2 to make sure there is only one y:<br>  <br>  y= -1/2x - 2<br>  <br>  Remember, when you divide, both numbers are divided by 2. So -1/2, and -4/2 give you that as your answer.<br>  <br>  Now that you are in proper slope-intercept form, what is 'm'?<br>  <br>  m= -1/2

yz6CTowhaa	Limestone is a carbonate rock, it reacts with acid; a pure limestone will dissolve completely in acid. Rain water slowly dissolves limestone, leaving depressions and caves etc.<br>  <br>  Hardness and structural strength will vary according to purity and faulting/joining and other factors.<br>  <br>  Texture (grain size etc)can vary a lot, depending on genesis of the limestone. Same for structure - can be massive or well-bedded. Most limestones are permeable and porous. <br>  <br>  Usually light in colour, but when weathered, can turn black.<br>  <br>  Because it is dissolved by rainwater, weathering of limestone leaves little residue, so tends to have very thin soils.  The fertility of these soils will vary, but in many places, successful agriculture has been practiced on these thin, sparse soils, eg sugar cane in Barbados.

52414242fe3ad4a32e2f2dfe56e02f62aa	Carbon dating has a useful limit of about 50,000 years, because the radioisotope C-14 decays relatively quickly.  Carbon dating is perfectly accurate within certain limitations, but it is almost never used for dating geological materials such as fossils.<br>  <br>  The absolute age of fossils and the age of the earth are determined using long-lived radioisotopes, such as U, K, Ar, Rb, and Pb. <br>  <br>  It is not possible to have sedimentary rocks "way older" than the fossils they contain, or vice versa. There is a fundamental and sound basis of geology that the key to the present is the key to the past.  In other words, geological processes that are happening today are the same as those that have been happening for eons.  <br>  <br>  For example, if a frog dies in a swamp, the frog's bones will end up in mud and in millions of years that mud may end up as a siltstone containing the frog's fossilized bones. There is no other way for a fossil to end up enclosed in rock, so the fossil and the enclosing sedimentary rock have to be of the same age.  Now we can't date the mud directly by radiometric methods, but we can date igneous rocks and volcanic ash under, above, or within, the mud-siltstone.  That gives us the ability to determine both relative and absolute ages.<br>  <br>  It seems there are some religious nutcakes out there who refuse to believe the perfectly sound principles of radiometric dating to satisfy their own ego. The concept of radioactive decay is irrefutable...if it didn't work, there would be no such thing as nuclear bombs or nuclear energy.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	If you set up a computer model of what you *think* something should be, then that is the result you are going to get.  Carbon dating is only good for organic materials, not rocks, which is pretty much what fossils are.  <br>  <br>  It's kind of like the global warming scare.  If you set up a list of perameters in a computer, you can just about tailor the results to what you want them to be.  This is why we have to listen to the latest thing that's supposed to kill us all, unless we dump huge amounts of money into the cause to stop it.  <br>  <br>  Then again, who knows.  Wood pallets have been known to petrify within 25 years.  If penguins and walruses went extinct and we found their skeletons, many would think this is some sort of evolutionary step.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	1.  Carbon dating is not inaccurate - archaeologists use it all the time.<br>  2.  It can only be used for dating material with organic matter that is less that about 50,000 or so years old.  So it can't be used to date anything older than that...OTHER radiochronologic methods are used.<br>  3.  Fossils usually can't be dated by radiocarbon methods because they usually don't contain any organic material anymore, anyway.<br>  <br>  There are a variety of different methods used to date rocks that are older than 50 to 60,000 years old (potassium-argon, uranium-lead, etc.) that can date rocks that are millions and billions of years old.<br>  <br>  BTW...I'm a geologist, I accept the 4.6 billion year old earth, and I'm an evangelical Christian.|`|Gem96NQyaa	For one thing, carbon dating isn't used on fossils... as you've already concluded, they're too old for it to be accurate.  That's why other isotopes are used.  For fossils and rocks in general, it's primarily Uranium-Lead, Potassium-Argon, and Rubidium-Strontium dating that's done.<br>  <br>  As for dating the rocks around the fossil... how exactly would a fossil get into a rock after the rock has formed?

Go to creation truth foundation at creationtruth.com Because people can't accept that there is a God that designed the universe.  Scientists study the layers of earth and speculate how many years it takes to get to each layer.  If they would look at the facts it is simple to see that events such as a world wide flood would account for the multiple layers.  <br>  Carbon dating is inaccurate because you measure the half life of a carbon atom.  If you half a book and measure one side as a given number of years and continue opening each half in the center you will eventually run out of pages to open.  Once you get to one page there isn't anything to half.  Same with the carbon atom.  So the dates are limited.  <br>  Dinosaurs environment changed after the flood and life was not sustainable with the climate change but proof existed that Dino's and man existed at the same time.<br>  Evidence from fossilized footprints, ancient artwork, literature and fossils all strongly support the fact that dinosaurs and humans did co-exist: <br>  <br>  Human and dinosaur tracks have been found together in several places, including the famous tracks near Glen Rose, TX.<br>  <br>  Near Glen Rose, TX, the river Paluxy cuts through layers of rock containing thousands of preserved dinosaur footprints (The type of rock the tracks are found in is similar to a raw form of cement, which hardened quickly and preserved the tracks.). <br>  <br>  The imprints found include those of a large, three-toed dinosaur (probably similar to the T-rex), an Apatosaurus, a large cat, and unique bear. Amidst these tracks are human footprints; in one place, 15 tracks appear in a consistent left-right pattern. <br>  <br>  The discovery of these human tracks among those of the dinosaurs has sparked much controversy and scientific debate between opposing worldviews. There is, however, sound evidence that these footprints exist. <br>  Engraved Inca burial stones from Peru depict numerous varieties of dinosaurs, suggesting that the artists had seen their subjects.<br>  <br>  Since their initial discovery in the 1930’s, over 1,100 engraved burial stones from the Inca culture have been unearthed. One third of these stones depict detailed and accurate pictures of dinosaurs, including triceratops, stegosaurus, and pterosaurs.<br>  <br>  Some of the stones actually show men and dinosaurs together, and since the stones usually depicted scenes from the life of the person with whom they were buried, it seems likely that the dinosaurs etched onto the stones were involved in some way with that person’s life. <br>  <br>  References to a dinosaur in the Book of Job indicate that dinosaurs still lived during the time that Job was alive (circa 1700 B.C.).<br>  <br>  The description of the behemoth found in Job 40 describes physical features not found collectively in any present-day animal. It does, however, match the features of the powerful Apatosaurus (commonly known as the Brontosaurus). The present-tense description of the beast suggests that the animal was living at that time.<br>  <br>  Fresh bone tissue found in a partially fossilized T-rex bone indicated that the animal lived fewer than 10,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  In 1993, a report surfaced in the journal Science that a T-rex fossil found in the United States contained fresh bone tissue with nucleated blood cells. Since organic molecules of this type can only be preserved (even in the best circumstances) for a few thousand years, this becomes compelling evidence that this animal was possibly alive when Noah was building the ark. <br>  <br>  A graduate student named Mary Schweitzer from the Museum of the Rockies in Montana found the fresh bone tissue; upon thorough microscopic investigation, she reportedly discovered nucleated blood cells still present in the tissue. She said that “it was exactly like looking at a slice of modern bone. But of course, I couldn’t believe it…the bones, after all, are 65 million years old. How could blood cells survive that long?” <br>  <br>  She showed the slide to her boss, paleontologist Jack Horner, and he told her to prove that they were not blood cells. She worked on this research for nearly seven years, and reported in Earth Magazine (June 1997, Vol. 6, No. 3, pp 54-58) that “so far, we haven’t been able to.” Dr. Horner and Edwin Dobbs, who co-authored Dinosaur Lives that same year (1997), reported that, “under the microscope there appeared to be blood cells preserved within the bone tissue. Mary conducted a number of tests in an attempt to rule out the possibility that what she’d discovered where in fact blood cells. The tests instead confirmed her initial interpretation.<br>  <br>  The truth is the earth is not that old it is not even 20,000 years old.<br>  <br>  On top of that there is evidence of a world wide flood.  Given all the fossils of sea animals any where from the Rockies to the Arbuckles.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps God Bless You!

Being a musician is a wonderful profession. It is very relaxing, fun, and entertaining. I know this because I play the piano and when I come home from work I love to play the piano after a long day. However, it depends on how successful of a musician you are. If you are no prodigy in any manner or don't truly believe that you can be successful with being a musician, I would not do it.<br>  <br>  Medicine serves as a great profession. It is exciting, inspiring, and challenging. I think that you should never give up music, especially being that you want to go to music school. However, I would do both. I would have a profession in the medical field and on your free time really try to excel as much as you can in music. Have the music serve as a source of entertainment and not a profession. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|oA0e5nHqaa	I agree with the two people above me. Don't do something out of guilt for your mom o that you've been doing it for so many years. You want to go into medicine, so do it. In fact, you can have a side job as a musician. I mean let's face it - musicians don't make a lot of money, and it's very hard to become a successful musician, and a doctor makes a fair amount of money - depends on what you do. So money wise, medecine. You want to do medicine, so do medicine. The only negative of medecine is that it takes a long time. <br>  <br>  Do what YOU want to do. And balance the two.
820e78fb52fa6459785b110a32d806b6aa	Let's break the integral in two and look at each piece<br>  ∫[0..2] dt = 2.<br>  So we are left with <br>  ∫[0..2] arctan(e^t) dt.<br>  Let u = e^t  t = ln u  dt = du/u.<br>  We get<br>  ∫ (1..e^2) arctan(u) du /u.<br>  Unfortunately, this integral is not elementary. It defines a<br>  new function Ti_2(u) called the inverse tangent integral.<br>  It is related to the dilogarithm function by <br>  Ti_2(u) = 1/(2i) * [Li_2(iu) - Li_2(-iu)].<br>  It has an infinite series representation given by<br>  Ti_2(u) = u/1^2 -u^3/3^2 + u^5/5^2- ...  (*)<br>  So to compute the second integral we have to compute<br>  Ti_2(e^2) -Ti_2(1).<br>  Ti_2(1) is a well-known mathematical constant<br>  called Catalan's constant. It's value is<br>  G = 0.91596559 (approximately).<br>  I also used (*) to compute Ti_2(e^2) and<br>  got 3.21278.<br>  So 2 -3.21278 + G = -0.3607 (approximately).<br>  By the way, (*) doesn't work directly to compute<br>  Ti_2(e^2) because it only converges for y <=1.<br>   However, Lewin's book derives the relation<br>  Ti_2(y) = Ti_2(1/y) + π/2 log(y) for y > 0.<br>  Thus Ti_2(e^2) = Ti_2(e^-2) + π and now<br>  we can use (*) to compute Ti_2(e^-2) and then<br>  add π to get the final result.<br>  This is rather reminiscent of trying to compute<br>  log(1+x) by using the usual Taylor series, which<br>  is only good for |x| < 1.

SAgCy83Oaa	Cranes have a long arm which extends out horizontally (or at an upward angle) with pulleys and cabling to hook to objects to be lifted.  At the other end of the arm are counterweights to help with the lifting and avoid the crane tipping or wrenching off its base.<br>  Cranes that move upward as a building rises from the ground don't really "lift" themselves (i.e., use their arm which is what they use to lift other objects).  Instead, they are equipped with hydraulic legs so they in-essence "climb" up to the next floors and get re-anchored so they can continue to lift objects.|`|qkblT2hgaa	You need to be a little more specific. What type of crane are you referring to? Most cranes have massive hydraulic cylinders that will raise the boom into position. Tower cranes, like the ones that you see on tall buildings, are erected (raised) by a larger crane that lifts it into position. These tower cranes can then raise themselves as the building gets taller. They do this by using hydraulic cylinders pushing against the concrete floors.|`|SYZQZGesaa	A typical crane uses pulleys (flexible levers) to do work. They use hydraulics to lift or rather steady themselves and they tip over when the weight at the end of the "lever" is too great.

This just doesn't happen; but eventually some genetic differences (that maybe don't have any outward physical effect) will eventually pass on.  <br>  <br>  But recorded history is only a few thousand years old, and evolutionary changes (for a large animal such as man) just don't happen that fast.<br>  <br>  End of rant.  <br>  Here's a reference to human chromosomal abnormalities:<br>  <a href="http://www.usd.edu/med/som/genetics/curriculum/1ECHROM3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usd.edu/med/som/genetics/curr...</a>|`|1gkoIXRRaa	No. We are still evolving.<br>   <br>  It is easy to think (incorrectly) that all mutations are good ones or that evolution always "improves" the the way we look or act.<br>  <br>  A mutation almost always causes death to the organism, usually very quickly.

nuhi9H6paa	Astronomers can say with near certainty that there are no moons with moons in our solar system. But that doesn’t mean it’s physically impossible.<br>  Although astronomers have spotted some asteroids with moons, a parent planet’s strong gravitational tug would make it difficult for a moon to retain control of its own natural satellite, you would need to have a wide space between the moon and planet. Orbiting far away from its parent planet, a relatively massive moon might be able to hold onto a moon of its own.<br>  Conditions like these might exist in far-off solar systems but because our current methods for planet-hunting—such as spotting one as it passes a large star, lend themselves to detecting mostly huge, Jupiter-like planets, not their moons.<br>  Even if astronomers spot a moon with a moon, it probably won’t last long. Tidal forces from the parent planet will tend, over time, to destabilize the orbit of the moon’s moon, eventually pulling it out of orbit. A moon’s moon will tend to be a short-lived phenomenon.|`|b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	It is theoretically possible, but it has never been observed.  Every astronomical body, be it a star, a planet, or a moon, has a region of space called its Hill sphere, in which that body dominates gravitational attraction.  The size of the Hill sphere depends not only on the mass of the body of interest, but also on the masses and distances of other nearby bodies.  The problem is that the Hill sphere of a moon orbiting a planet tends to be pretty small, making it unlikely that a small enough space rock, like an asteroid or meteoroid, would be in the right place at the right time to get captured.<br>  <br>  However, Rhea, a moon of Saturn, was recently found to possibly have a very small ring system, consisting of fragments the size of a grain of sand, all in orbit around the moon.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	If the moon is heavy enough and far enough away from the other planet, yes. But how massive would then the planet have to be relative to the star that it orbits?|`|KHSOVxViaa	It's not impossible, but such an orbit would likely be unstable due to the gravitational interaction between the planet and major moon.  Even inside the sphere of influence, the perturbation by the planet would be significant.  If anything did become a secondary moon for a while, sooner or later the orbit would change shape, crashing into the moon, or be ejected to somewhere else.<br>  <br>  I think it's significant we don't see any of these in the solar system.|`|8V7gSeAlaa	Yes actually it is<br>  If I'm not mistaken, Jupiter has a moon that has a moon.|`|1c635f446d91828fc99f4dc9a1a95a3baa	Yes it is possible, but often, tidal forces due to gravity tend to break up systems like that.|`|QJ5Lh3wUaa	Yes<br>  <br>  The laws of gravity do not vary with regard to scale (well okay maybe at quantum scales, or an billions of light year scales between distant galaxies - but those are both irrelevant here).<br>  <br>  Simple proof it's possible:   Just as the planet goes round its sun, and the moon goes round its planet, push things up one step (e.g. consider putting the planet where the sun is, the moon where the planet was, etc.)<br>  <br>  Second simple proof:  Spacecraft have been put in orbits around the moon - e.g. Michael Collins on the Apollo 11 command module orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin landed -- so there is no reason why a natural body could not follow the same orbit.
De4vgWXPaa	If they have evidence of life on a distant planet, then they'd have to be incredibly dishonest or stupid not to state such a thing.  Why you should find straightforward honesty somehow pompous is a mystery, especially as this is a matter of your own hypothetical construction.  In reality, I've never heard a scientist claim to have evidence of life on some distant planet.<br>  <br>  <<Scientists in general love to claim things that are not proven but state them as fact.>><br>  <br>  What a fine example of a silly generalized smear.  Well done.<br>  <br>  <<When do you think these pompous goons will devise some creative way to detect "proof" there is life on a planet 40000000 light years away (when in reality, they can't even prove there is in fact a planet at all).>><br>  <br>  That pointless little "pompous goons" says far more about you then it does about anybody else.

Such evidence would include finding that there was high levels of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere of such a planet (which could be remotely  determined by spectroscopy), since there are no known chemical or geological processes which can do this - only life (by photosynthesis).|`|vxSXsn59aa	Speaking of pomposity..........<br>  You make it very clear that you know next to nothing about science, scientists, or the scientific method when you make unsubstantiated (and wrong) claims like this. Yet you act as though YOUR knowledge is superior to that of millions of highly educated and dedicated researchers all over the globe.<br>  That pretty much defines pompous. A little humility is an admirable quality in anyone, and in someone as uneducated as you appear to be, a lot of humility is probably too little.<br>  When a scientist actually asserts that something is a fact, you may be very sure that he can prove it to any reasonable person. By which I mean, anyone but people like you.|`|19PgkkFWaa	OK i swear if your a christian im gonna snap....of course there is life out there...look at the drake equation, there could be 10,000 civilizations in our galaxy alone..scientist say there probably has been 100 million million civilizations in the universe...so why not? how do we know not even ONE of them have visited the earth?<br>  <br>  by the way if you don't believe in evolution and fact go to the r&s section go pray to your fake magical fairy|`|xDPQ700baa	Worst "I hate scientists claims" question yet.|`|lIEUegRiaa	Scientists won't claim to have proof of life on another planet unless they DO have proof. Most likely, they might state "evidence suggesting the possibility" of life, based on a spectroscopic analysis of the light coming from the planet, assuming they can gather enough light to make this determination. Finding evidence of organic molecules in a planet's atmosphere would  be very exciting, but not proof of life. To do that we would have to send a probe to that star system to do a survey, and that would take hundreds, if not thousands, of years (at current technology levels).<br>  I think what you are really saying is that you don't get along with your science teacher. How else would you get these ideas about scientists?<br>  <br>  Within about 50 years, scientists might gather enough evidence to strongly suggest the possibility of life on a specific exoplanet, but without having an alien lifeform or piece of alien technology - both highly unlikely things for a scientist to be able to produce, because such things most likely reside only on and near their own isolated planet of origin - a scientist would never make such an unfounded claim. <br>  <br>  Besides, 40 million light years away is a very long way, as far as neighbouring galaxies, so it is highly unlikely that any determinations about exoplanets that far away will be made within hundreds of years.|`|KHSOVxViaa	If a scientist is caught lying, then the rest of the scientific community will no longer trust his work.  Peer review is a cornerstone of scientific method.<br>  <br>  I've yet to hear of a scientist who claims to have proof of life on an exoplanet.  However, many scientists (and others) may speculate that life _could_ exist elsewhere, creating hypotheses to explain their ideas.<br>  <br>  Could you please give a link or reference to this "proof" or "claimed facts" you mention?

3ZPYB7nxaa	Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy, not science. It is the study of non-material objects. Plato's philosophy proposed all physical objects were manifestations of some immaterial object which was prefect. The physical versions of this perfect object were imperfect, due to the fact material itself was imperfect. The Catholic church then adopted Plato's ideas but reworked the interpretation of "imperfection" as "sin". Metaphysical objects contain neither mass nor energy and can be thought of as completely static, unchanging  ideas. Again, the Church re-interpreted this to mean "truth" and ultimately "dogma".|`|CtZz3z4Waa	Metaphysics is the math behind the underlying structure of the universe and everything in it.

4PK0hiWeaa	It's theoretically possible, you would need to travel faster than the speed of light. Because of relativity you would experience time at a slower rate where everything else would be at a normal rate.  So that said you would only be able to go into the future in that scenario.  If a there was a device that could create a wormhole through time you could travel backwards in time but only to the point of when the wormhole was created.  Of course this is all theory and may never see reality.|`|AAivZMMOaa	have u heard about "john titor"...i read somewhere about him... he claims that he came from future (if im not mistaken year 2036).. he seems to be realistic..he explained the ship that brought him to our time is generating a tiny black holes as big as a donut and the ship go into the hole.. he came before the WTC fall,before tsunami tragedy, and he actually tell about it, but no one believe him.. go read about him... for me, i believe on this time travelling things... here i have a video for you on youtube..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mshn3VFntu4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mshn3VFnt...</a>|`|IpZSfK3jaa	Going forward in future only needs immense technological developments.But to go back to past is a bit tough even theoretically|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Well the people on Lost are time travelers.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	We'll see...|`|5p85tSGgaa	Universe is considered as a sphere and the planets,stars,galaxies,etc. are located on this sphere.

There's no complete answer.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't travel back in time, because it could create distortions in time.

You decide to teleport instantaneously to the west street corner, so that you can look back and see yourself at the east street corner by the light you reflected just before you teleported. So you do, but first you wave at the empty street corner.<br>  <br>  When you get to the west street corner, you look back and see yourself waving from the east street corner. So you instantly teleport back to the east street corner, thinking that you will now be able to see yourself at the west street corner.<br>  <br>  When you reach the east street corner, you see another copy of yourself waving back at the west street corner. You conclude that he is your earlier self, but, that's funny, when you were your earlier self you don't remember your later self teleporting in to stand beside you.<br>  <br>  In fact, if you could teleport back and forth fast enough between the street corners, you could accumulate a whole crowd of copies of yourself at both places. They would disappear, of course, as soon as their timeline reached the moment they teleported. And none of them would see the ones later than themselves. Or would they? What would prevent them from seeing their later selves?
KHSOVxViaa	I'm struggling to think of a time when there WASN'T somebody predicting doom of some kind.

They'll be doing more of it in 2013 onwards.  Look both ways crossing the road and you'll be fine!|`|nuhi9H6paa	There are a lot of rumors, weak though they might be, to predict that the we're all going to die in 2012. These people intentionally try to persuade people otherwise for some sort of attention, fame or profit. <br>  <br>  However, there's one significant fact that the 2012 doomsayers all seem to forget: Despite all the various 2012-ish predictions for the end of the world, there are far more stories of apocalypse with different dates. For example, popular interpretations of Nostradamus found predictions for the end of the world in July of 1999, December of 1999, June of 2002, and October of 2005. It's also been said that his writings could mean the dead will rise from their graves in either 2000, 2007, or the year 7000. Nostradamus never said anything about 2012. <br>  <br>  A number of Bible scholars found firm scriptural evidence that the Rapture would happen in October of 2005. Thousands of Koreans gave away all their money and possessions in preparation for the Rapture on October 28, 1992. Even Sir Isaac Newton made a calculation based on scripture that showed the Rapture could not happen before 2060. Some Jewish scholars place the "end of days" via Armageddon in the year 2240. I couldn't find 2012 mentioned in any of these stories.<br>  <br>  In fact, James Randi's magnum opus publication An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural lists 44 distinct end of the world predictions that all came and went unfulfilled. <br>  <br>  There is no astronomical indication of the existence of another large planet in the inner solar system. Look at Jupiter. Literally! It's about ten times the diameter of the Earth, and it's on average about 750 million kilometers (450 million miles) away. It is easily visible to the naked eye, and in fact is usually the fourth or fifth brightest object in the sky.<br>  <br>  Yet, for Planet X to be here in less then a decade, it can't be farther than a billion or so kilometers away. Even at that distance, it would be one of the brightest objects in the sky. Even if it were too faint to be seen with the naked eye, it would still be seen easily. There is simply no way a big planet so close to Earth could have escaped astronomers' detection.|`|GWCMQUnIaa	Honestly mate, don't believe that crap.<br>  HOW ON EARTH COULD ANYONE PREDICT THE END OF THE WORLD.<br>  That is the most moronic thing I have heard in my life. <br>  The only reason,it may be even remotely true was if something was threatening us directly, such as a meteor. <br>  Not in god's name can the world magically end, it cant just implode and life as we know it disappears in an instant.<br>  Sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but looking at the current theories and theories from the past, it's not going to happen.<br>  Just because a fancy scientist wakes up in the morning and is like, wait, eureka, the world is going to end in about 5 years doesn't mean it will.<br>  Other significant theories were probably 2000, and all the others were useless, the biggest is probably 2012, that's because it's in OUR future!|`|68l1TeDjaa	nobody can predict this!!! they are a bunch of hypocrits wanting attention. 2012? what happened with Y2K?!?! it was supposed to end then! scientists make predictions all the time. next the will predict the end in another year. honestly if it happens it happens. we wont suffer too long. everyone knows that sooner or later it will happen, but not in our lifetime. they predicted it happening in 2012 but then they said it wouldnt happen in this life! why are you so scared? they can not honestly predict when this world is gonna end. they can just study it. its a money thing!!!|`|VRjYO2dLaa	Nobody can't tell when the world ends,but according to the Holy Bible there were signs that Jesus is coming to judge the living and the dead,when war nation against nation, famine, disaster etc. but even Jesus don't know the exact time  He will come to Judge it's only The God Father knows the exact time for judgement.Don't be afraid and nothing to afraid off because all of us will return to the creator of life.We are only like a mist that it will fade away when sun rises.Just do the well of God.And find His Glory by doing the mission He wanted us to do .|`|QPWjtDzcaa	This should get you started:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abhota.info/end1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abhota.info/end1.htm</a>|`|5H7Wgaknaa	Here is a list of previous end of the world predictions: <a href="http://www.abhota.info/end1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abhota.info/end1.htm</a><br>  A litany of crackpots and failed prophecies. 2012 will be no different as it's based on no real science whatsoever.
ajzq5nKIaa	It's generally the form:<br>  <br>  A = {variable : conditions on variable}.<br>  <br>  so e.g.<br>  <br>  A = {x : (x is even) and (x >= 2) and (x <= 12)}<br>  <br>  (where >= is greater than or equals to and sim. for <=.)<br>  <br>  B = {x : (x = 4) or (x = 8) or (x = 12)}<br>  <br>  E = {x: (x is even) and (x >= 2) and (x <= 20)}.<br>  <br>  Note these are not unique answers; for the first one e.g. you could have said<br>  <br>  A = {x : (x is even) and (x > 0) and (x < 14)},<br>  <br>  since this also gives the same set of evens; or you could even have said<br>  <br>  A = {x : (x = 2k) and (k is in the integers) and (k >= 1) and (k <= 6)},<br>  <br>  since this says we can express x as 2 times another number (i.e. it is even), where this other number an be as low as 1 (giving 2) or as high as 6 (giving 12).<br>  <br>  Similarly for B, there were only 3 elements, so we can just express them all one by one as we did, or we could say for instance<br>  <br>  B = {x: (x = 4j) and (j is in the integers) and (j > 0) and (j < 4)}.<br>  <br>  If answering homework though, I'd just put the first and simpler one. In each case, the best thing to do is to try and describe what you've got in words as simply as possible, and try and translate this to maths. You often get conditions involving <, >, <= and >= since x is usually given in some range. Then you can use 'and's and 'or's to 'build' the set.

nuhi9H6paa	Although hard evidence for this has not yet been found, most cosmologists tend to believe that some form of life is bound to exist somewhere in the universe. This belief rests on the fact that there are billions of galaxies in the observable universe. There remains a very significant possibility of life existing somewhere else. The exact form of life that can exist is a matter of speculation – it need not be carbon and oxygen-based like it is on earth. Moreover, these life forms may or may not have evolved intelligence, as we know it.<br>  <br>  Aliens need not look like us to resemble us in more fundamental ways. Consider that the four most common elements in the Universe are hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen. Helium is inert. The three most abundant, chemically active ingredients in the cosmos are also the top three ingredients in life on Earth. For this reason, you can bet that if life is found on another planet, it will be made of a similar mix of elements. Conversely, if life on Earth were composed primarily of, for example, molybdenum, bismuth, and plutonium, then we would have excellent reason to suspect that we were something special in the Universe<br>  <br>  Any beings capable of bridging the vast distances between the stars would be able to clean our clock when it comes to science and engineering. Visitors from other worlds – should any appear – would be enormously ahead of us from a technological viewpoint.|`|SpcYCBndaa	the possibility is zero to none<br>  so there is a chance!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks|`|19PgkkFWaa	Well i do believe very wholeheartedly that their out there...i mean who's to say an extremely intelligent race could bend space time and lets say go through a black hole to another side of the universe where we are? and maybe they have visited earth...chances are they haven't...but who knows|`|AA11926471	you are correct that most assumptions of life on other planets are based on the number of earth-like planets in the universe, and there are probably quite a few. still, i think it very unlikely that any have any life on them at all. <br>  consider that on the most earth-like planet that we know of (earth), life is an extremely rare event. in fact it is only thought to have occurred once. even our best science, in the most ideal laboratory conditions have not been able to reproduce the event. <br>  it is almost impossible that it happened once by chance. to expect it again, even on earth is very unlikely, let alone elsewhere.|`|GIH9JB04aa	Very possible.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	Your question is best answered by Jodie Foster in the movie Contact.<br>  Watch it, it's a good movie.|`|pOL4Z3xAaa	It would be naive to think that there isnt anything else out there, but consider that they might be like us, unable to travel to other places in the universe, or hell there could be a planet with dinasour type things, just because there aliens doesn't mean that they are super intelligent.|`|aHvJcb0uaa	i think other life forms are out there somewhere, apart from humans. because there are places in the universe where even the strongest telescopes cannot reach, places like earth, maybe. people who say aliens do not exist shouldnt be so sure. unless of corse they have met one.........|`|LiIcHo33aa	i do believe in other lifeforms, but i think all these "abductions" are all hoaxes created by the government. but yes, i do believe that far away there are other species of life.|`|xsOE77mxaa	As we are existing in this universe aliens may also exist.<br>  <br>  It may also be in a completely different universe.|`|yy0Ht3fSaa	The top scientists in the world will tell you that the possibility of extraterrestrial lifeforms ("aliens") existing in the universe(s), in space and time, is very high.  They will also tell you that it is very likely that the reason other lifeforms do not make their presence known, or "visit" our planet, is because of one of two reasons...:<br>  <br>       1.)  They simply do not find us "worth their time".  They look at us the same way we would look at ants in a gigantic set of woods.<br>  <br>       or<br>    <br>       2.)  They will come, but only when they feel the need to, or when they are ready.  Other life in space may see that it would not be good to come to our planet for any reason, or if there was a good reason to come to Earth, it isn't the right time to yet.<br>  <br>       Of course, there is another possibility.  That is:  they are already here.  Science would agree that extraterrestrial life that exists in space undoubtedly is far more advanced than we could even imagine.  Aliens could be around each and every one of us, constantly monitoring us, monitoring our every move, reading our thoughts, and even controlling what we think or do in our everyday life.  Their technology would have to be so powerful that they harnessed the power of invisibility.  We would not be able to know for sure if aliens were here, furthermore, if they were, unless our technology was, by chance, as great as theirs.<br>  <br>       To go even further, IF they were here, I can only think of only two reasons why we are not yet extinct as a species.  Scientists all over the world know this, too.  They will tell you that extraterrestrial life is EXTREMELY likely to dislike us, rather than to like us.  It is obvious to scientists that other life-forms that exist elsewhere in space would look at us more like a meal than a friend, or more like an ant than a helpful, interesting being.  <br>  <br>       The two reasons that I can think of, concerning why humanity is not yet extinct, if extraterrestrials were already here, around all of us:<br>  <br>       1.)  They have already wiped us extinct several times, only to find out that TIME itself rewinds and repeats, and to their anguish and frustration, we "come back".  They might know that it is far too easy to destroy a race that appears so simplistic.  They may be able to destroy humanity in the matter of a few seconds.  <br>  <br>       2.)  Even though they intensely dislike us, they may have found out something about us that they themselves find hard to either understand or accept.  It may be something to the effect of humans evolving into their kind eventually, and they have to watch us closely until the reason for that becomes apparent and certain to them.  They might not be able to destroy us until that happens.<br>  <br>       Whatever the actual TRUTH is, the answer to your question "What is the actual possibility of aliens?", is:  "Certain" (they exist).  In conclusion to this discussion, scientists will also agree on one more notable thing:  that there is not just one "different" alien species out there, there is more likely to be several, probably an unimagineable amount, of extraterrestrial lifeforms that exist, in the "infinite" boundaries of deep space.

dGN8YoEQaa	Well...it looks like the taxonomists aren't really sure where the zoophycos belongs.  It seems that it has been classified as a ichnogenus (a fossil produced by an animal or plant)--><br>  <br>  Zoophycos is an ichnogenus thought to be produced by feeding worms.<br>  <br>  An ichnotaxon (aka: trace fossil) is defined by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature as "a taxon based on the fossilized work of an organism". Ichnotaxa are names used to identify and distinguish morphologically distinctive trace fossils. They are assigned genus and species ranks by ichnologists, much like organisms in Linnaean taxonomy. These are known as ichnogenera and ichnospecies, respectively.<br>  <br>  Ichnotaxa include trace fossils such as burrows, borings and etchings, tracks and trackways, coprolites, gastroliths, regurgitaliths, nests, leaf mines, and bite and gnaw structures, as well as secretions modified by organismal activity, such as cocoons, pupal cases, spider webs, embedment structures and plant galls.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichnogenus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichnogenus</a><br>  <br>  I think you are going to have trouble with the taxonomy.  From this website: <a href="http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/paleontology/defTraFos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/paleontology...</a><br>  <br>  Ichnotaxa are given Linnaean-style (binomial) taxonomic names, just as if they were actual organisms. The assignment of names to actual animals (or parts of animals) is usually dictated by the rules set out in the ICZN (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature; there is also an ICBN for botanical names). However, trace fossils are not actual organisms or parts of organisms, so they cannot be given Linnaean names recognised by the International Committee on Zoological Nomenclature.<br>  <br>  Very occasionally, it may be possible (e.g. by finding a fossilised body fossil at the end of a trail or burrow) to learn which particular organism makes a particular trace fossil – assuming the trace is distinctive enough to be sure that apparently identical versions are not created by several different organisms – but mostly the "owner" is unknown. Part of the confusion regarding this nomenclature arises from the common lack of connection between the trace fossil name and the name of its original trace maker. Some trace fossils were made by unknown, extinct, or poorly preserved organisms, hence the ichnogenus name can not be expected to reflect a specific trace maker.<br>  <br>  As far as the crinoid stem goes...I could only find the present day crinoid taxonomy:<br>  <br>  Phylum Echinodermata (echinoderms) <br>   Class Crinoidea (feather stars and sea lillies) <br>   Subclass Articulata <br>   Order Bourgueticrinida <br>   Order Comatulida <br>  <br>  <a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/classification/Crinoidea.html#Crinoidea" rel="nofollow">http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/si...</a><br>  <br>  Here is some information on the fossilized crinoid species:<br>  <br>  Some fossil crinoids, such as Pentacrinites, seem to have lived attached to floating driftwood and complete colonies are often found. Sometimes this driftwood would become waterlogged and sink to the bottom, taking the attached crinoids with it. The stem of Pentacrinites can be several metres long. Modern relatives of Pentacrinites live in gentle currents attached to rocks by the end of their stem, which is fairly short. The largest fossil crinoid on record had a stem 40 m (130 ft) in length.<br>  <br>  In 2006, geologists isolated complex organic molecules from 350-million-year-old fossils of crinoids -- the oldest such molecules yet found.

Then function lost is assumed to be related to the part of the brain that was injured. A famous example is Phineas Gage (see first link). A more modern way to study function of the cerebral cortex is using brain imaging techniques such as fMRI. In fMRI the person is given a task, and parts of the brain where the fMRI sees an increase in brain activity are assumed to have function associated with the task that the person is doing (see second link).

AA10008098	During early development of the fetus, the preponderance of male or female hormones soft wires the individual to be male or female, including visible primary traits.  Females have two X chromosomes and males have an X and Y chromosome and this leads to the appropriate preponderance of male and female hormones (both are present).

fofzdoROaa	A geostationary orbit is when the satellite appears to be fixed relative to the earth. So because the earth rotates once per day so does the satellite in this orbit.<br>  <br>  A polar orbit is one that cuts the axis of rotation of the earth. Depending on the orbital distance, so its speed will change and so will its time. One very close to the earth is about 93 minutes but as the satellite gets further away this time increases.|`|KHjYq2bHaa	Geostationary orbits take the same time as the Earth spins on its axis, 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Polar orbits are at lower altitudes, and so take much quicker time to orbit the Earth.
bKfAte8aaa	Since you have the DNA fragments already cut that means you've already used an enzyme to do so.  After that, you use the micropipet to insert the DNA into the gel slots and run electricity through the gel for 'x' time.  The larger the fragment, the less it'll move down the gel.  The smaller the fragment the more it will move.  So you should see the 2600 basepair move a teeny bit more than the 2700 base pair dna fragment.

z7BiMSWmaa	Both James Hutton and Charles Lyell are considered the fathers of uniformitarianism geology. Uniformitarianism geology is all that has been taught since shortly after the word geology was coined in 1778. Although catastrophism geology is alive and well among many geologists, currently the word geology connotes uniformitarianism. <br>  <br>  It is not that Hutton and Lyell are competing for the title of father. James Hutton is credited with lying the foundation of uniformitarianism geology by questioning the then current belief that the sedimentary rock strata was laid down by Noah’s worldwide flood. Hutton saw evidence of multiple deposition events and subsequent upheavals and igneous intrusions that revealed a long history of the earth. Although it would appear that much of that evidence would point to catastrophism, Hutton saw only uniformitarianism. <br>  <br>  Although 45 years went by before Hutton’s ideas really had a significance influence, at that time, Charles Lyell added a chronology of the rock layers called the geologic column and added age dates and names to the layers. So Hutton laid the conceptual foundation for uniformitarianism geology and Lyell built the structure of geology upon that foundation. <br>  <br>  The uniformitarianism concept, along with its mandatory accompanying old earth philosophy, provided the primary influence for Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution. Together these ideas have caused a paradigm shift from a biblical creationist, young earth worldview to a humanistic, evolutionary old earth worldview

AA10008098	Likely because as you travel downstream more streams (contributaries) join the flow and water can also drain into the river through its banks if the ground water table elevation is higher than the river surface.  Also as the gradient is reduced crossing a plain or approaching the sea, the river's average velocity is reduced and the cross-sectional area perpendicular to flow must increase to maintain constant flow in cubic feet per second, etc.
ThYN1mFFaa	100 uM = 100 umoles/liter.  Since the MW = 6141, then 100 umoles will be 6141 x 100 = 614100 ugms. So this would be in 1000 mls or 614.1 ug/ml.  This is equivalent to 0.6141 mg/ml.  If you want 0.5 mg, you need just less than 1 ml, or 0.814 mls or 814 ul.
JUmfm168aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I'll use u[n] for a general nth term, S[n] for a sum of n terms, d for common difference, l for the last term, and a for first term. Then a = u[1], and l = u[n] at nmax.<br>  <br>  Note that u[n] = a + (n - 1)d. This is explained later.<br>  <br>  The sum of an arithmetic series is S[n] = ?n(2a + (n - 1)d).<br>  <br>  [Why?<br>  Because if you write the sequence forwards, in terms of adding d, then backwards, in terms of subtracting d, and sum, you get:<br>  <br>  S[n] = a + (a + d) + ... + l.<br>                   +<br>  S[n] = l + (l - d) + ... + a.<br>  <br>  So:<br>  2S[n] = (a + l) + ((a+d) + (l - d)) + ... + (a + l).<br>  <br>  But: (a + d) + (l - d) = a + l. This is true for each term.<br>  There are n terms in the sum to n, giving n lots of (a + l).<br>  So: 2S[n] = n(a + l).<br>  Thus: S[n] = ?n(a + l).<br>  <br>  The definition of a term such as l is u[n] = a + (n - 1)d.<br>  Then, substituting: S[n] = ?n(a + (a + (n - 1)d)).<br>  Simplifying a + a: S[n] = ?n(2a + (n - 1)d) as desired. ]<br>  <br>  So: S[4] = ?*4*(2a + (4 - 1)d) = 4a + 6d. And you have that S[4] = 10.<br>  And: S[6] = ?*6*(2a + (6 - 1)d) = 6a + 15d. And you have that S[6] = 33.<br>  <br>  So: <br>  (1) 4a + 6d = 10.<br>  (2) 6a + 15d = 33.<br>  <br>  1? * (1) gives:<br>  (3) 6a + 9d = 15.<br>  <br>  Then, to get d, subtract the a's. Using (2) - (3):<br>  (6a + 15d) - (6a + 9d) = 6d.<br>  33 - 15 = 18.<br>  So: 6d = 18.<br>  Dividing by 6 gives: d = 3.<br>  <br>  Now, in an arithmetic series, each term can be represented by the first term plus a multiple of the common difference.<br>  <br>  Or, u[n] = a + (n - 1)d.<br>  <br>  [Why? <br>  For each progressive term from a, you add the difference d to the previous term. This means that instead of n differences in n terms, there will be only (n - 1) differences, with the first term accounting for the beginning of the sequence. ]<br>  <br>  Now, you have that u[k] = a + 3(k - 1).<br>  And you know that u[k] = 502.<br>  So: a + 3(k - 1) = 502.<br>  <br>  Since you have to know a to get k, we need a way to find a.<br>  From earlier, you have S[4].<br>  S[4] = 4a + 6d.<br>  And, from before, S[4] = 10.<br>  So: 4a + 6*3 = 4a + 18 = 10.<br>  Subtracting 18: 4a = -8.<br>  Quartering: a = -2.<br>  <br>  Returning to u[k] :<br>  Recall: a + 3(k - 1) = 502.<br>  Substitute a = -2 → 3(k - 1) - 2 = 3k - 3 - 2 = 3k - 5 = 502.<br>  Adding 5: 3k = 502 + 5 = 507.<br>  Dividing by 3: k = 507 / 3 = 169.|`|qlFEO5xNaa	Sum of Nth term of AP or Arithmatic series  is written as <br>  S_n =  n/2{ 2a + (n-1)d} where  n is terms number , a is first term and d is common diff.<br>  <br>  hence we have S_4 = 4/2 ( 2a+3d) = 10 <br>  <br>                                  2a+3d = 5<br>  simliraly <br>  <br>                  S_6 = 6/2 ( 2a+5d) = 33 <br>                             2a+5d = 11<br>  <br>  solving these two eqn we get <br>                  d =3 ans and also a = -2<br>  <br>  now    502 =   a+ ( n-1) d subsitute the value and solve for n.|`|VxZl2hTcaa	We can represent the nth term by<br>  a_n = a + (n-1)d<br>  where a is the first term and d is the common difference.<br>  <br>  Then we can represent the sum of the first n terms with<br>  s_n = n[2a + (n-1)d]/2<br>  <br>  The sum of the first four terms is 10:<br>  s_4 = 4[2a + (4-1)d]/2<br>  10 = 2[2a + 3d]<br>  10 = 4a + 6d<br>  4a = 10 - 6d<br>  a = (5/2) - (3/2)d {equation 1}<br>  <br>  The sum of the first six terms is 33:<br>  s_6 = 6[2a + (6-1)d]/2<br>  33 = 3[2a + 5d]<br>  33 = 6a + 15d {equation 2}<br>  <br>  Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:<br>  33 = 6[(5/2) - (3/2)d] + 15d<br>  33 = 15 - 9d + 15d<br>  33 = 15 + 6d<br>  6d = 18<br>  d = 3 {answer to part (i)}<br>  <br>  Plug back into equation 1:<br>  a = (5/2) - (3/2)(3)<br>  a = (5/2) - (9/2)<br>  a = -4/2<br>  a = -2<br>  <br>  The kth term is 502:<br>  a_k = -2 + (k-1)(3)<br>  502 = -2 + 3k - 3<br>  502 = 3k - 5<br>  3k = 507<br>  k = 169 {answer to part (ii)}|`|2s0x8pH2aa	(a) let "a" be the first term<br>  d is the common difference<br>  so,<br>  as per the question,<br>  <br>  a + a2 + a3 + a4 = 10<br>  a + a + d + a + 2d + a + 3d = 10<br>  4a + 6d = 10..........(i)<br>  <br>  also,<br>  a + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 = 33<br>  a + a + d + a + 2d + a + 3d + a + 4d + a + 5d = 33<br>  6a + 15d = 33...............(ii)<br>  <br>  from equations (i) and (ii)<br>  3x (i) => 12a + 18d = 30<br>  2x (ii)=>  12a + 30d =66<br>                 (-)  (-)        (-)<br>                ---------------------<br>                  0 + 12d= 24<br>                           d = 24/12 =2<br>  so, common difference,d = 2<br>  substituting the value of d in equation (i)<br>  <br>  4a + 6d =10<br>  4a + 12 = 10<br>  4a = 10-12<br>  a = -2/4 = -1/2<br>  <br>  (b) kth term = 502<br>  a + (k-1)d = 502<br>  -1/2 + (k-1)2 = 502<br>  (k-1)2 = 502.5<br>  k = 502.5/2 = 251.25 ~ 251(approx)|`|Vb0Y2NHiaa	(i)<br>  From the formula..<br>  <br>  S = (n/2){2a[1] + (n - 1)d}<br>  <br>  for the first 4 terms..<br>  <br>  10 = (4/2){2a[1] + (4 - 1)d}<br>  <br>  rearranging by algebra..<br>  <br>  10 = 4a[1] + 6d<br>  a[1] = (10 - 6d)/4<br>  <br>  for the first 6 terms<br>  <br>  33 = (6/2){2a[1] + (6 - 1)d}<br>  33 = 6a[1] + 15d<br>  a[1] = (33 - 15d)/6<br>  <br>  combining the 2 eqns for a[1]<br>  <br>  (10 - 6d)/4 = (33 - 15d)/6<br>  60 - 36d = 132 - 60d<br>  24d = 72<br>  d = 3<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  a[1] = {33 - (15*3)}/6<br>  a[1] = -2<br>  <br>  (ii)<br>  a[k] = a[1] + (k - 1)d<br>  502 = -2 + (k - 1)3<br>  504 = 3k - 3<br>  507 = 3k<br>  k = 169; 169th term

Gt5JzC2Daa	Starting from something like a bigger/better version of the safety paper cutter here?<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_cutter" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_cutte...</a><br>  <br>  Two simple ways of push/pulling the handle...<br>  First is to use a solenoid. that gets you a direct linear motion. You'd need a REALLY heavy duty solenoid to push/pull the handle, and it's motion would probably be too fast<br>  <br>  Second, and perhaps easier in practise is to use an electric motor (and maybe a gearbox) to rotate a screw thread. If a nut is placed on to the screw thread and the nut is prevented from rotating (by an Adapter than fixes the nut to the handle) the nut and handle will be driven along the axis of the screw thread. It's direction depends on which way the screw thread is turning/the "handiness" of the threads.<br>  <br>  Then you just need a little box that controls the motor. You need a way of sensing when the cutter has traversed across the paper (so that the motor/solenoid doesn't try to force the cutter too far/knows to make a "return trip"). Just use some kind of proximity sensor (read relay&magnet, or even a micro-switch ) to detect when the cutter is at the limits of it's travel.<br>  ---<br>  Still need to explain how to implement the control box, but first I need to understand the kind of motion/control you are wanting.<br>  <br>  Presume you want the fool control to start the machine when it's pressed. Need some more idea about how you would like the control to function// How are  you wanting the controls to to work....<br>  <br>   Having the pedal work like a deadman's brake, and to stop the machine when it's released sound's like a very good /essensial requirement? Do you want the machine to continue go back and forth, doing "cutting cycles" so long as the pedal remains pressed? Or do you want the machine to start a single cycle when the pedal is pressed, and need the pedal to be released and pressed again (at the end of the cycle) to "order" another cycle.<br>  <br>  Also there's question of what constitutes a cycle. Should the handle/cutter be returned to one side, after it's cut the paper? Is it fine for the handle/cutter to just travel across to the other side, without needing to return untill more paper is added?<br>  <br>  ---<br>  threaded rod/nuts can be got from most decent hardware shops. So can expoy resin to make an adapter/holder for the driven nut.(lay tin foil/silcone spray to prevent things you don't want being joined, sticking together, and then pour the expoxy into a mould) Probably be able to get brackets/boxes/screws/sheet metal to make a frame for the machine, and hide the electrics safely away.<br>  <br>  For a motor/gearbox try a (decent) model shop, or an electronics parts supplier like Maplin/RS. electronics parts supplier usually have an asortment of switches you could find useful, as well as the other electrical components you are likely to need to complete your project.|`|BWXZf6j4aa	You can't modify a machine at work because it is potentially dangerous and if an accident occurred: <br>  1.

ajzq5nKIaa	EDIT - I did this an idiotically long way round, sorry :) Here is my new improved answer:<br>  <br>  I think you mean<br>  <br>  f(x) = (x - 3)/(x^2 + 2x - 15).<br>  <br>  Note first that x^2 + 2x - 15 = (x + 5)(x - 3), so that<br>  <br>  f(x) = (x - 3)/[(x - 3)(x + 5)] = 1/(x + 5).<br>  <br>  Note also that f(x) = (x + 5)^(-1). Now we can use substitution: Let x + 5 = u, and f(u) = u^(-1). Then we know that<br>  <br>  df/dx = (df/du)*(du/dx). <br>  <br>  Using the power rule that x^n differentiates to n*x^(n - 1), and the fact that du/dx = 1, the first derivative is<br>  <br>  df/dx = -u^(-2)*(1) = -1/(u^2) = -1/(x + 5)^2.<br>  <br>  Now for the second derivative: let df/dx = F(x) to make notation easier. Then notice that<br>  <br>  F(x) = -(x + 5)^(-2); so then we can use the same substitution: let u = x + 5, then du/dx = 1, and F(u) = -u^(-2), so that<br>  <br>  dF/dx = (dF/du)*(du/dx) = (d/du)(-u^(-2))*(du/dx)<br>  <br>  = 2u^(-3) = 2*(x + 5)^(-3), and since<br>  <br>  dF/dx = (d^2f)/(dx^2), then the second derivative is<br>  <br>  (d^2f)/(dx^2) = 2*(x + 5)^(-3) = 2/((x + 5)^3).|`|IzCCoKNoaa	restart; <br>  with(plots): <br>  <br>  Plot y=x^2-7x+3 and use the first derivative test to determine where the graph is increasing and decreasing. <br>  <br>  > f:=x->sin(x^2-7*x+3); <br>  Df:=unapply(diff(f(x),x),x); <br>  _EnvAllSolutions := true: <br>  critpts:=solve(Df(x)=0,x); <br>  indets(critpts[1]);#indets(critpts[1]) or indets(critpts[2]), <br>  #whichever one is _Z1~ (which is an internal <br>  #MAPLE integer variable) <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  > z:=indets(critpts[1])[1]; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  > a:=plot(f(x),x=0..6): <br>  b:=plot(Df(x),x=0..6,linestyle=2): <br>  c1:=plot([subs({z=-3},critpts[1]),t,t=... <br>  c2:=plot([subs({z=-3},critpts[2]),t,t=... <br>  c3:=plot([critpts[3],t,t=-6..6],color=... <br>  c4:=plot([subs({z=-2},critpts[2]),t,t=... <br>  c5:=plot([subs({z=-1},critpts[2]),t,t=... <br>  c6:=plot([subs({z=0},critpts[2]),t,t=-... <br>  c7:=plot([subs({z=-2},critpts[1]),t,t=... <br>  display([a,b,c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,c7],tit... in solid, derivative in dotted`); <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One can use fsolve to determine exactly where the x-intercepts of the function are. <br>  <br>  > x1:=fsolve(f(x)=0,x=1/2); <br>  x2:=fsolve(f(x)=0,x=1); <br>  x3:=fsolve(f(x)=0,x=2); <br>  x4:=fsolve(f(x)=0,x=5); <br>  x5:=fsolve(f(x)=0,x=6); <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Plot y=(x^2-9)/(2x-4) and use the first derivative test to determine where the graph is increasing and decreasing. <br>  <br>  > f:=x->(x^2-9)/(2*x-4); <br>  Df:=unapply(diff(f(x),x),x); <br>  DDf:=unapply(diff(Df(x),x),x); <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Because of the singularity at x=2, the functions go off the graph near x=2. <br>  <br>  > a:=plot(f(x),x=-1..5,y=-15..15): <br>  b:=plot(Df(x),x=-1..5,y=-15..15,linest... <br>  c:=plot(DDf(x),x=-1..5,y=-15..15,lines... <br>  display([a,b,c],title=`function in solid, 1st deriv in dotted, 2nd deriv dashed`); <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Plot y=x(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) and use the first derivative test to determine where the graph is increasing and decreasing. <br>  <br>  > f:=x->x*(x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)*(x-4); <br>  Df:=unapply(diff(f(x),x),x); <br>  DDf:=unapply(diff(Df(x),x),x); <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  > a:=plot(f(x),x=-1..5,y=-15..15): <br>  b:=plot(Df(x),x=-1..5,y=-15..15,linest... <br>  c:=plot(DDf(x),x=-1..5,y=-15..15,lines... <br>  display([a,b,c],title=`function in solid, 1st deriv in dotted, 2nd deriv dashed`);|`|qTFsfIa5aa	the above one is right........<br>   second = Rem : for this you need to differentiate first derivate

NcfAplShaa	Looking at your last answer I'm not sure if your question has been answered. You'll need some wire, perhaps a switch & the lamp itself. Easiest generator to use would be the type they used to use on bicycles - they used to have a little wheel that ran against the wheel to turn the generator. You could replace the little wheel with your turbine. They used to just screw on with a lock-nut on the top. To make your turbine you could use a 100mm to 150mm disc of tin plate & cut say a dozen or so radial slots around the circumference & then bend the pieces in between 90 degrees so they are parallel with the disc's axis. Another essential part is a nozzle to direct the water onto the turbine blades. Maybe a garden hose nozzle? The nozzle is important as it accelerates the velocity of the water such that it will drive the turbine fast enough to generate usable voltage & current. You'll need to enclose te turbine & nozzle in something & a Friend of mine used a cake tin to house his. His one was used to power his holiday home. Only the turbine & nozzle end need to be enclosed. The generator can poke in from the side. Don't forget to put a drain in the enclosure as what goes in has to come out. Hope this helps. Good Luck.|`|54bidlgDaa	Your water turbine is probably very simple as far as the electricity coil goes. First, you should try testing the easy part; the water turbine itself. Pass some water through it in the way that you would in your demonstration and see how fast it turns. If it is too slow and you can watch a single point go around and around, there is too much drag on the wheel or there is not enough water flowing. If this is the problem, fix this first because even if you have a good coil, it will not do you any good if it does not spin very fast. If this still does not fix the problem, or you want to improve the design, consider how good you made the coil. The more wraps of wire that the armature has and the more powerful your magnets are, the more current you can generate. A good performing coil should have well over 1,000 wraps of wire and the more you have, the better. Your magnets are also very important. If they are too far away from the armature, they lose their field of effectiveness and therefore will not do you any good. You can also try adding a small gearbox to your turbine that will convert the slower speed of the turbine to a much higher speed at the armature. You can do it with 2 gears, but the more gears you have in a more complex gear box, the better your turbine will perform.
nuhi9H6paa	The age of the universe is the time elapsed between the Big Bang and the present day. Current theory and observations suggest that this is between 13.61 and 13.85 billion years. The uncertainty range has been obtained by the agreement of a number of scientific research projects.<br>  <br>  Light reaching us from the earliest known galaxies has been traveling, for more than a 13 billion years. So one might assume that the radius of the universe is 13.7 billion light-years and that the whole entity is double that, or 27.4 billion light-years wide. The universe has been expanding ever since the beginning of time, when theorists believe this event occurred from an infinitely dense point in a Big Bang.<br>  <br>  All the distance covered by the light in the early universe gets increased by the expansion of the universe. Think of it like compound interest. Imagine the universe just a million years after it was born, a batch of light travels for a year, covering one light-year. At that time, the universe was about 1,000 times smaller than it is today. <br>  <br>  Accordingly, that one light-year has now stretched to 1,000 light-years.<br>  All the pieces add up to 78 billion-light-years. The light has not traveled that far, but the starting point of a photon reaching us today after traveling for 13.7 billion years is now 78 billion light-years away. <br>  <br>  That would be the radius of the universe, and twice that -- 156 billion light-years -- is the diameter. That's based on a view going 90 percent of the way back in time, so it might be slightly larger.<br>  <br>  Basically the universe has expanded to 27.4 billion light years wide x 156 billion light years in diameter.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	Yes, it did and does expand FTL.

EofngGK2aa	It depends on the size of the electromagnet, the size of the metal used, the type of metal, the amount of wire coils used, the type of wire, the power source, etc. It's very variable and you can't give a general statement on how much one can lift.
RgSCstkAaa	You can do this in 2 ways. Either you browse a source of information such as<br>  <a href="http://www.coolmagnetman.com/magmath.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.coolmagnetman.com/magmath.htm</a><br>  <br>  or you hunt around for a large bar of soft iron and start wrapping wire round it until you generate sufficient force with the power supply available to you.
Gmvldblraa	You need an iron core - an iron rod - about 30 cm long, 1cm in diameter.<br>  The best shape is to have it bent into a U. That will give you two arms to wrap the coils on and a bend to act as a hook so you can hang the magnet from some sort of stand. <br>  Find about 5 m of wire. It must be insulated and able to carry about 4 amps without getting hot - thats single core electric cable - any hardware store and its cheap.<br>  Wrap about 70 turns of wire around one arm of the U and the same around the 2nd arm ( making sure the turns all have the same "clockwiseness" ) - that will make the coils about 3 layers deep. Keep it neat and lock in place with duct tape.<br>  A 12 volt supply ( as used for some garden lighting setups) will be sufficient to send 4 amps through the wire and the magnet will easily hold of the order of 5kg. You should install a rheostat in series with the magnet to control the current and make sure it doesn't exceed the fuse setting of the power supply.<br>  <br>  Do not write "....stuff like metal or iron...." . You will make you teachers think that you don't know that iron IS a metal; and you might make them think that you think any metal can be attracted to a magnet, when in fact iron is the ONLY common metal that can be attracted. ( Nickel and Cobalt are the other two well known attractors but they are hardly common.)

Q1SABrSXaa	well i know a study on how growth hormone and anabolic steroids has been done and the study is almost finished and results are due in the next yr or so.. this was a long study done over 10-15yrs or there abouts.

bae299c73e121a8a45067e0818073b1baa	Do you mean Reflecting telescopes (mirror-based) vs REFRACTING telescopes (lens-based)???<br>  <br>  Ok, I won't go into cost of manufacture, as you have heard this somewhere before(?). Except to say that the expense is largely due to having to grind and polish not one, but at least two full surfaces in a refractor. But ultimately when you get to the world's largest telescopes there is an upper limit to the manufacture and use of refracting (lensed) telescopes. <br>  <br>  The larger the aperture (diameter of the glass) the thicker the glass must be. The world's largest refracting telescope is a mere 40 inches in diameter, and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Thicker than that and it starts absorbing more light than it can focus. <br>  <br>  Also remember that glass is really a very cold liquid. In a refractor the lens can only be supported along the edge so that the path is clear for light to come through un obstructed. Above 40 inches the massive weight of the refractor's lens causes it to sag and warp from only being supported along the edge, resulting in distorted images. <br>  <br>  Finally, refractors tend to be heavier overall than reflecting telescopes because of their longer solid tubes and require a larger housing and a more massive mount. The 40 inch at Yerkes Observatory has a 63 FOOT-long tube.<br>  <br>  So, when we are talking REALLY BIG telescopes, the advantages of a reflector over a refractor start to add up in a hurry.<br>  <br>  At any size if any observations requiring an accurate recording of colors for say, spectroscopy, reflectors won't disperse color as most refractors are to one degree or another. For variable star estimating, I understand that reflectors are preferable too.<br>  <br>  If you personally use telescopes, it is more comfortable to view an image coming out near the top of the tube (Newtonian reflector) which is merely inverted (upside-down) than to crouch at the bottom of a tube (refractor) which will have the image be reversed right to left when viewing with a diagonal prism or mirror (if no diagonal is used the image will just be upside down).<br>  <br>  There are advantages to using refracting telescopes for certain types of observations, but I won't go into them here since I don't think that was your question.|`|GIH9JB04aa	I'm not sure but I highly recommend a reflector!|`|uApQ57Pyaa	reflectors have no advantage over reflectors, its a tie!<br>  was one of those "reflectors" supposed to be "refractors"?

G5QC5f5baa	You can do a lot with a VFD.<br>  <br>  The strength tester idea would be good if the VFD has a good torque control function and you can construct the mechanical load arrangement.<br>  <br>  You can do a lot with a VFD without connecting a load. Read the manual carefully and see how many of the VFD capabilities you can demonstrate. Connect external components to all of the control inputs and outputs. Many VFDs have outputs to energize lights and relays in response to such things as operating above or below a particular speed or completing the acceleration ramp. There are probably analog outputs proportional to speed and torque. Without a load for the motor, you can still show a brief load by accelerating the motor very quickly. Many VFDs can "ride thru" a brief power interruption. Supply poser to the VFD thru a contactor and interrupt power very briefly by wiring a normally closed pushbutton in series with the contactor coil and just tap on the switch very quickly. If you are allowed to abuse the VFD, you could demonstrate its self protective functions by wiring a circuit to short the output.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	If you have DC power source and a good sized motor, start it with several current limiting resistors in series with it.  As the motor voltage builds up, have it pick up relays that progressively short out the series resistors until it is running on full line voltage.  The idea is to limit the starting current to some fairly low value.  Two or three resistors make for a good project to watch the relays pick up as the motor picks up speed..|`|G3LpGWXbaa	Strength Tester:<br>  Make a spring-loaded grip with a switch and potentiometer attached. Wire the switch to a VFDs start input. Wire the potentiometer to the VFDs torque input. Set up a pulley system to lift a weight attached to a scale. The pulley will be driven from a three-phase motor wired to the VFD.<br>  <br>  With this circuit you could explain in detail the dynamics of speed and torque in an AC induction motor (flux current, slip, frequency, etc...). You could also discuss the control functions of your particular VFD.<br>  <br>  BTW- be sure to limit the max speed on your VFD since you will be controlling torque.|`|SYZQZGesaa	FUN? Hmmm....well if it were me, I would build on the first answer and change a few things. I would use a timer circuit to sync the 2001 SPace Odyssey music with a gradual build up of motor speed that powered lights on with the music, gradually turning more on and getting brighter until a climax with the music. You could even light different sections. One of the key factors with electric motors is their capacity to work both ways.

7uFaB8QQaa	Let's assume both the thrown ball and dropped ball start from the same height h.  Now the ball that is thrown at the ground starts out with some initial speed v0 so the total energy of this ball is:<br>  <br>  E1 = 1/2mv^2 + mgh<br>  <br>  All of E1 gets converted to potential energy when the ball bounces and reaches its new maximum height H, and, assuming no energy is lost on the bounce, then new height can be found using conservation of energy:<br>  <br>     H = [1/2 v0^2 + gh]/g > h<br>  <br>  Now the ball that is dropped has a total energy of:<br>  <br>   E2 = mgh  which is smaller than E1 by an amount 1/2mv0^2 .  So the dropped ball can only return to its initial height.

It is also possible that the blood types of the parents were not being remembered correctly by the person posting the question, or the tests weren't done correctly and one or the other parent's blood types is different from what they think it is.

pRF5LLloaa	You are correct.  What we see TODAY actually happened 12.2 billion years ago.  Quite litereally "A long time ago in a galaxy far far away"!  What we see today is like a "snapshot" of what happened billions fo years ago.<br>  <br>  You might think of it as being like a movie or video tape.  What you see in a move or video ACTUALLY happende when the movie was filmed.  But you only see it when the movie is played.  So in effect you ARE seeing "into the past" -- not because you have a time machine, but just because of the delays it take to do it.<br>  <br>  I don't know HOW they measure these distance.  obviously, no body has a ruler that long!<br>  <br>  But what this DOES illustrate is the extreme falacy and stupidity of things like "Space Aliens" and  the SETI program.  The speed of light is the absolute limit.  NOTHING with any significant mass can come close to that speed because of the Mass Dilation Effect described by Einstein.<br>  <br>  The next closest star to our own is 4.5 light years away.  it would take a radio messge (which travels at the speed of light)  4.5 YEARS to get to us from there, and another 4.5 yeara for a mesage from us to get to them.  So if "aliens" from Alpha Centuri sent us a radio messgae, they wouldnt get an answer for 9 years!.<br>  <br>  But Alpha Centuri is close enough that we can KNOW that it does not have any habitable planets.  And all other stars are MUCH farther way. if would take CENTURIES to talk to them, and much much longer for a space ship to fly from there to here<br>  <br>  Due to these really huge, vast "interstellar" distances, aliens are NOT coming to visit us, they did not "seed" our planet, and meaningful communications with them would be impossible -- their civilizationn would be dead before our answer got back.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	Yes, it happened 12.2 billion years ago, before there was a solar system here.  <br>  <br>  A light year is simply the distance that light travels in one "year" ( the IAU definition specifies one Julian year) or exactly 9,460,730,472,580.8 km or about 9.46*10^12 km.|`|TuR5vMuzaa	Every time you look at sky you look at past.You see a star how it was 1000's of years(may be millions of yrs) back .It may not even present now.To know that you may have to wait again millions of years.|`|1c635f446d91828fc99f4dc9a1a95a3baa	Yes, and they can measure by the redshift, using Hubble's Law:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses//astro201/hubbles_law.htm" rel="nofollow">http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/acade...</a><br>  <br>  And yes, you are looking at the past.

Every time we look up at the stars, we're looking into the past, the farther the star, the further into the past we're looking.  A light year is a distance, not a time.

Even with the Redshift, it's still light they are measuring...so we were seeing something destroyed when the Universe was very young. It was likely a star that was faulty in design, because it would not have lived out it's 5 billion year lifespan when it ended 12.2 billion years ago.

This energy allows the individual to exercise for a longer period of time. Of course, anaerobic respiration will take place after a certain point when the aerobic process cannot take place fast enough.<br>  <br>  Muscle, along with the liver, store a lot of glycogen which (when glucagon is released from Beta cells in the islets of langerhans, a specialised tissue of the pancreas) is converted to glucose, when levels of glucose in the blood are low.

xbma9SuWaa	Water for instance needs a certain amount of energy (based on its mass and intital temperature) in order to boil and once at boiling temperature an even greater amount of energy is required to make the water change into steam.  <br>  <br>  The interesting things is that the temperature of the boiling water will not rise as you add energy.  The heat energy will go into making a phase change from water to gaseous.   Actually a relavtively large amount of energy is required to make this phase change.   If this steam were to turn back into water all of the phase change energy would be relases along with water at boiling temperature.  Therefore if it were to hit your skin you would be feeling the energy of the water + the energy of the phase change + Any energy in the steam.  This would be much more energy than just from the water alone
FUVakx3yaa	A monohybrid cross is a cross in which both organisms are hybrids (heterozygotes) for a single gene.  For example, if a gene has two alleles and the dominant allele is A and the recessive is a, then a monohybrid cross would be:<br>  <br>  Aa  x  Aa<br>  <br>  The offspring would be the following genotypes in equal proportions:<br>  <br>  AA<br>  Aa<br>  aA<br>  aa<br>  <br>  giving a 1:2:1 ratio of the genotypes AA:Aa:aa<br>  <br>  A dihybrid cross is a cross in which both organisms are hybrids (heterozygotes) at two genes.  For example, if there are two genes, each with two alleles and for the first gene, the dominant allele is A and the recessive is a, and for the second gene, the dominant allele is B and the recessive is b, then a dihybrid cross would be:<br>  <br>  AaBb  x  AaBb|`|0efeb3d3eeb7fbb11fad400e45ac3335aa	A Monohybrid cross is an experiment in which only a single genetic trait is being studied.  A popular example of a monohybrid cross is Gregor Mendel's Pea Plants and studying the crossing of a Tall and Dwarf Plant.  A monohybrid cross always occurs in about a 3:1 ratio in that the dominant trait is seen 3 times as much as the recessive trait.  <br>  A Dihybrid cross is an experiment in which two genetic traits are studied.  An example would be studying pea seeds being wrinkled or round (1st trait) and yellow or green (2nd trait).<br>  <br>  To set up a cross of traits for either monohybrid or dihybrid you will have to set up a Punnett Square.  Check out the website below for information on how to set up a Punnett Square.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!

KHSOVxViaa	This could mean several things, but essentially it's a migration of people to or from a colony after it has become independent.<br>  <br>  It could be where the people from the former colony migrate to the former colonial power because of better job opportunities and living conditions.  An example may be the migration of people from Pakistan to the UK after independence.<br>  <br>  It could also mean a migration from the former colony to somewhere else.  Such an example could be the current flow of migrants (and refugees) from Zimbabwe to South Africa, escaping difficult conditions at home after its independence and decline.<br>  <br>  It could also mean an inflow of migrants into the former colony, if it is seen to be an attractive place to live and work.  An example of this is the immigration into the USA after it became independent, or the large-scale immigration into Australia from the 1950s onward.<br>  <br>  Yet another meaning could be the migration of settlers from the colony to 'home country' after independence, if they felt it was a bad idea to remain.  An example of this is the million or more Portuguese who left Angola for Portugal (and Brazil) at Angolan independence in 1975/6|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	In terms of American history, it sounds very much like the influx of Irish ex patriots to the USA in the very early 20th century. Up to this point, the population of America was mostly mainland, Northern European, particularly the English. This all changed when thousands of Irish left their homes to find factory work promised to them by American entrepreneurs. Sadly for many of them, the massive influx of cheap labor saturated the market and this first wave of immigration was forced to live in tenement slums all along the eastern coast of the USA, particularly New York city. The filth and disease forced the city to enact some of the first public health mandates. "Typhoid Mary" was an irish domestic servant who had a natural immunity to Typhoid fever. She unintentionally killed several children and was eventually apprehended and lived the rest of her life quarrentined on a small island just outside New York city. Those Irish who moved inland found work as coal miners in places such as West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal mining was dangerous, and the miners suffered lung disease because of the dust, but this work was the most highly paid and also the most respected. Tragically, when the coal was exhausted at a particular mine the company moved out of town, leaving the population unemployed. This led to the severe Appalacian <br>  poverty which existed in the 1950's and 1960's. Appalacia was the only place in America that people actually starved to death. Like Arfican Americans, the Irish contributed heavily to American culture, despite their hardships. Their major impact has been country and western music, which was based on traditional irish folk songs played on fiddles.<br>  <br>  Of course, American industry grew rapidly in the first half of the 20th century, attracting another wave of southern European immigration, notably the Italians. The italians in turn contributed to American culture as well. In a negative sence, their style of businesslike, organized crime influenced many of the gangsters of the 1930's, like Al capone. Their major positive impact has been in American cusine. The Pizza is not a traditional Italian dish, but was invented in Chicago.<br>  <br>  The Chineese were another group of post colonial migrants. These were recruited to work on the trans-pacific railroad which linked the eastern and western US via rail. Many supervisors found them far superior to the Irish - Chineese workers were more harmonious in large groups and didn't drink habitually. This meant they were far better to use with high explosives such as nitroglycerine. This very unstable compound was needed to blast rainway tunnels though mountains. <br>  <br>  Like the Italians, the Chineese contributed to America in a culinary sense. Not only Chineese cooking, but Chineese resteraunts have become a stand feature in nearly all large American cities. In fact the concept of a resteraunt was Chineese in origin. The notion of a business devoted to feeding workers in the middle of the day was doubtlessly the inspiration for most of the "fast food" franchises which sprang up in America in the middle of the 20th century.<br>  <br>  The latest wave of post-colonial immigrants are latinos from South America, notably Mexicans. However, latinos have influenced American culture all during the 20th century. mexican cooking was well established long before the rush of immigration started. Like the irish, the Mexicans also contributed to an American holiday - Halloween. This has ancient roots in the Aztek "day of the dead" and was assimilated by the Catholic churce.<br>  <br>  Finally in terms of religion, The English were primarily protestants. irish and mexican immigrants allowed the catholic church a foothold in America. Of course, eastern European jews brough their faith to this country along with the Italian immigration wave.

EofngGK2aa	Meiosis:<br>  Phases G1, S and G2<br>  Step 1: Interphase:<br>  Interphase consists of three smaller phases called G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), and G2 (second gap). During G1 the cell grows by synthesizing new molecules, proteins and organelles. In S phase the cell replicates its Chromosomes, however they are not easily distinguished as they are in the form of loose Chromatin. In phase G2 the cell finishes off duplicating its contents (Importantly it now has two Centrosomes) and gets ready for Meiosis to begin.<br>  Phase M1<br>  Step 2: Prophase I:<br>  Prophase I is the most complex phase of Meiosis, and takes a large amount of time to complete. The Chromatin fibres coil and fold together forming several Chromosomes (Can be seen with a light microscope) and the nucleoli dissipate. Each Chromosome consists of two identical sister Chromatids stuck together with a narrow bit located roughly in the middle, called a Centromere. In a process called Synapsis homologous chromosomes (Each made up of two sister chromatids) come together and pair up, forming a tetrad. The Chromosomes composing the tetrad cross over and exchange segments of DNA (This contributes to genetic variability). Outside of the Nucleus the two Centrosomes begin to form the spindle. The Centrosomes move away from each other (using molecular motor proteins) while rapidly extending microtubules which meet between the two. The Nuclear envelope fragments and disappears, releasing the Tetrads. The two Centrosomes migrate to the “poles” of the cell (One Centrosome at each end of the cell). The Chromosomes (Now even more condensed than earlier in the phase) develop protein structures on both sides of the Centromere called Kinetochores (One per Chromatid), the microtubules extending from the Centrosomes latch onto the Kinetochores on both sides, using molecular motors to move the chromosomes towards the centre of the cell.<br>  Step 3: Metaphase I: <br>  At the onset of Metaphase I the spindle is fully formed, having poles at both ends of the cell. The Tetrads (Held together at the site of crossing over) line up horizontally on the Metaphase plate, each chromosome in the tetrad lines up at a different pole. The two chromosomes which compose a Tetrad are both attached to separate poles of the spindle. It is thought that unattached Kinetochores send out a signal preventing Meiosis from continuing prematurely without all Chromosomes aligned. <br>  Step 4: Anaphase I: <br>  Anaphase I begins with the separation of the Tetrads at the sites of crossing over (Achieved through the use of relatively powerful molecular motors on the Kinetochores). Once the Chromosomes are separate they are moved up the microtubules (Centromere first) by ATP powered motor proteins on the Kinetochores, towards opposite poles of the spindle. The Spindle microtubules attached to the Chromosomes shorten while the non-attached spindles lengthen; this elongates the cell and pushes the Chromosomes closer to the poles. Anaphase I is finished when equal and complete collections of Chromosomes are present at both poles. <br>  Step 5: Telophase I and Cytokinesis: <br>  The Cell elongation started in Anaphase continues and both poles of the cell now have a haploid Chromosome set (Each Chromosome is made up of two identical sister Chromosomes at this point). The spindle disappears at the end of Telophase I, but reforms for Prophase II.<br>  Cytokinesis (defined as the process whereby the cytoplasm of a single cell is divided to spawn two daughter cells) is sometimes thought to be the final part of Telophase; however it is a different process which occurs at the same time. A cleavage furrow forms, effectively “pinching” the two poles apart and forming two separate Daughter Cells (Each containing the same genetic information). Cytokinesis is also driven by the Golgi body, which moves Microtubules into the centre of the cell, aiding cell division. The end of Cytokinesis marks the end of the M1-phase. The two cells are now ready to continue the process of Meiosis, or reform the nuclear envelope and undergo a second Interphase in preparation for the M2 phase<br>  Phase M2<br>  Interphase II*<br>  *May or may not occur depending on the organism involved.<br>  Disintegrated cell parts reform and the Chromosomes unwind; the cell rebuilds and “Rests” before condensing the DNA and getting rid of the various structures unneeded for Meiosis (e.g. the Nucleoli).When this has occurred the cell can continue on with Meiosis.<br>  Step 6: Prophase II:<br>  During Prophase II the Centrosomes move away from each other (using molecular motor proteins) while rapidly extending microtubules which meet between the two. The two Centrosomes migrate to the “poles” of the cell. The Chromosomes (Now even more condensed than earlier in the phase) develop protein structures on both sides of the Centromere called Kinetochores (One per Chromatid), the microtubules extending from the Centrosomes latch onto the Kinetochores on both sides, using molecular motors to move the chromosomes towards the centre of the cell.<br>  Step 7: Metaphase II: <br>  At the onset of Metaphase II the spindle is fully formed, having poles at both ends of the cell. The Chromosomes line up horizontally on the Metaphase plate, with each Kinetochore facing an opposite pole. The two sister chromosomes which make up a Chromosome are both attached to separate poles of the spindle. It is thought that unattached Kinetochores send out a signal preventing Meiosis from continuing prematurely without all Chromosomes aligned. <br>  Step 8: Anaphase II: <br>  In Anaphase II the Chromosome is finally split in two identical sister Chromosomes (This is done with molecular motors on the Kinetochores). Once the Daughter Chromosomes are separate they are moved up the microtubules (Centromere first) by ATP powered motor proteins on the Kinetochores, towards opposite poles of the spindle. The Spindle microtubules attached to the Daughter Chromosomes shorten while the non-attached spindles lengthen; this elongates the cell and pushes the Chromosomes closer to the poles. Anaphase II is finished when equal and complete collections of Chromosomes are present at both poles. <br>  Step 9: Telophase II and Cytokinesis: <br>  The Cell elongation started in Anaphase continues and both poles of the two cells now have equal numbers of the separated Daughter Chromosomes. The Nuclei begin to reform and the spindle disappears at the end of Telophase II<br>  Cytokinesis occurs at the same time. A cleavage furrow forms, effectively “pinching” the two poles of the cells apart and forming four separate Daughter Cells. Cytokinesis is also driven by the Golgi body, which moves Microtubules into the centre of the cell, aiding cell division. The end of Cytokinesis marks the end of the M2-phase and therefore the end of Meiosis.<br>  Phase overview:<br>  Phases G1 and G2 are short for “First Gap” and “Second Gap” respectively, these are the periods in which the cell grows by duplicating organelles and producing new molecules. Phase S (Which comes between G1 and G2) is short for “Synthesis of DNA”, during this phase the cell grows as it does in G1 and G2, however it also duplicates its Chromosomes, hence the name. At the beginning of Phase S all Chromosomes are single, the cell “reads” the DNA’s data and synthesises copies of its Chromosomes, which then become double (Having two joined sister Chromatids). M phase stands for Meiosis phase; this is when the cell starts to divide. M1 refers to the first division and M2 refers to the second (and final) division.

So when you plugnchug, just use 0.85 for v, and your answer for speed will come out as a fraction of c.

GhVAFsQGaa	It would be difficult...The classic instruments used in this endeavour use a known sample of a non- condensable gas sealed inside a semi-flexible container....any density change in the atmosphere would cause a deflection ( imagine a drum with a low pressure charge of air SEALED inside, as the air density changes outside the drum, the head would distort) and then the deflection would be measured to determine the density....these devices can't adjust for temp or humidity though, and they have an effect on air density- It is possible to make such a device, but it would not be that reliable....aircraft altimeters are a good examples of such a device, and they rarely work well enough to stay within a hundred feet...how accurate would it need to be?
KHSOVxViaa	We humans are born here because we live here.  We're not aware of any life elsewhere, let alone humans.  While life might well exist in far-off exoplanets, they won't be humans.<br>  <br>  Of course, this answer may change if humans ever send inhabited spaceships on long journeys to colonise exoplanets, as humans will then be born outside this solar system.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	We can only relate to our experience which is earthly. There can be millions of solar systems just like ours out there. No, I can't provide a link.|`|uOqk7PzGaa	There is no particular reason for that. The answer to this question is the following: "that's is just what happened". There is no other possible answer from a science standpoint. <br>  <br>  Now, you can go ahead and invent your own delusion (i.e. god) about it, just like many people in the past have done.|`|24d30303d7dfdc03b1d6d393f19ad4bcaa	This would be more effective if you've asked "Why are we born on this Earth only?" Lets think of our Solar System. The planets which are nearer to the Sun like Mercury, Venus etc. are very hot that there nobody can exist. The planets which are farther than Earth are icy plains and there also no body can exist. Our Earth is the only planet which supports life having water in three forms, atmosphere which supports growth of life. So we are living on the edge. If we are a bit nearer to the Sun, or a bit farther to the Sun, there would be no life on this planet too.|`|PeMADKZJaa	Well, i believe that there are other intelligent life forms in other solar systems and galaxies. Not necessarily little green men that are super genius', but they're probably questioning the same things we are. They'll definitely look different, but that would be normal to them. WE would be the weird looking ones.|`|SKW8awPsaa	u cant decide where u like to born!<br>  <br>  say for example in another solar system there may be a fellow who would be asking this same question that why are we born on this solar system only? hahaha<br>  <br>  there may be another solar system <br>  there may be aliens<br>  there may be POSSIBILITIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ro0lmK5haa	Because we were born by our parents who were also born in this solar system :)|`|P6s2dOw3aa	we born on this solar system because this solar system contains the living conditions for the all the living beings that's why and our almighty lord made us to born on this beautiful mother earth which is making us to leave. So we must very very great full to our mother land and for the god who is being saving us so we are much proud and we are to have this type of solar system with the great god.|`|2bEEtEhDaa	because you were scheduled  to be born on this solar system it was your destiny that brought you here maybe the aliens (if there are any) think why they are born in their respective solar system why not anyone else's but how can you be born in any other Solar System when you ARE A HUMAN !! if you are an Alien then you can ask but it is a law of nature and the universe that all humans have to be born on Earth you can't break that law so stop thinking why and start thinking Why Not ??? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jw84VHTKaa	Every person is born on this solar system because they are assigned some works to complete. There are some works which can be completed by a specific person only. According to Hindu Mythology, We takes 64 times birth on solar system. So to balance the working of earth we are born.|`|GHkpKIamaa	Nobody can prove that that is true, but I believe that since there is no mention of otherworldly intelligence in the Bible, that is probably not true.|`|a82e039a011452a5447702c31ab1e17caa	Somewhere we have to take birth any how. Wherever we are born we will still be asking the same question.

DWBV84NTaa	The bird in your photo is a Bluebird, and I believe it to be a female Mountain Bluebird. That bright, cerulean blue colour is often a good field mark as well.

It is still very possible to see one there, even if outside the normal range. Always keep that in mind. I know it seems unlikly, but the bird in the photo really looks like a Mountain bluebird to me. You never know! **   =)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Female Western Bluebirds usually show at least a little bit of a rusty colour, which your bird does not seem to show.. See this photo for comparisonn:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Oba53bnXINI/SAz7D5oMVMI/AAAAAAAAORA/IoLhjZEGVSc/IMG_0856.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Oba53bnXINI/SAz7D5...</a><br>  <br>  And last would be Eastern Bluebird. Once again, they typically show a rusty colour on the chest and nape area.

Mountain Bluebirds are not found in Arkansas, their range ends further west.

OXsRXLx1aa	Submarines are considered thin-wall pressure vessels because the ratio of wall thickness to internal diameter is larger than 10 (yours is 400!) <br>  <br>  I would check www.matweb.com for a material that suits your needs. It should be a form of steel due to cost constraints of building a real submarine. If a common steel does not suit your design you should redesign your submarine with adequate internal support (as mentioned here) and/or increase the thickness of your submarine. A symmetrical support system would work best.<br>  <br>  You should be particularly mindful that weldments on a submarine are the weakest parts and should note that your submarine model is a single shell perfectly cast out of a single piece of metal.|`|R2XDlMqTaa	basicly......there is no thin shell submarines that go any real depth., just due to the pressures. the hulls were made of hy80 steel and over 2" thick, to withstand the enormous pressures while submerged at deep depths. they are proably a different aloy now.|`|HTmj2BXDaa	If you want something a little easier to model, how about aluminum beverage cans.  They are certainly thin wall and they are not complicated by the presence of reinforcing internal structures.  They are also slightly less expensive to test to failure.  good luck|`|qaMPEdL2aa	I would think that you could just go ahead and do a submarine design.  Real submarines have internal frames in addition to the shell. but you could concentrate on a segment between two adjacent frames.  I have no idea what the radius to thickness ratio is for a real submarine.<br>  <br>  You might also think about an underwater tunnel for autos or trains.
