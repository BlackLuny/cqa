LCA7gdoiaa	I'm in Ohio so you might be just a bit milder.  I've been planting "potted" tomatoes on my back deck for years since we live in the "woods". (It's really thick here)   Plant things like peppers now.  Toward the end of March is good for tomatoes (A grow light is a good investment)   When you put them out in pots (about the third week of April (Plant them Deep - about 2/3 of the stem)   If the temperature isn't going below 45 you can leave them out overnight - otherwise bring them back inside until "Mothers Day"  You can use last years soil with no problem but I usually buy a bag of "Miracle Grow Soil" and mix about 25% in.  Some years I use miracle grow (the mix with water stuff) every couple of weeks. Last year my plants were easily 7 feet tall and I had to put cages around them early on and added dowel rods later to support the forks. For regular tomatoes use the biggest deepest pots you can manage and water about every day. I also use 2 large plastic "window boxes  and I plant about 6 "cherry" tomato plants in each - staggered.  "Sweet Baby Girl" was the variety I planted the last 2 years and they were great with over 500 on the 12 plants. <br>  <br>  Peppers are less maintenance and the only thing needed may be a Dowel rod for support and again frequent watering.<br>  <br>  Last year I actually grew water melons and brussell sprouts.   BUT that's a whole different story. Brussell sprouts drew worms and weren't productive enough.<br>  <br>  The melons did very well but 80 mile per hour winds from Hurricane Ike destroyed my vines and I only got a few.  May try again this year - but they really take up space.<br>  <br>                                       Hope this helps.

If I'm sowing seeds that are several years old, I'll sow them more thickly, since I'll expect some won't grow.<br>  <br>  That said, some seeds have longer shelf lives than others. Depends on the variety, and how they're stored. I've had bean seeds grow that were 10 years old.<br>  <br>  And seed have been found in egyptian tombs and successfully germinated.  <br>  <br>  Keep them in a dry, cool place, and you'll have viable seeds for a long time.|`|LCA7gdoiaa	I have a favorite cherry tomato seed which I've had over the past 5 years.  I keep them in zip lock bags and in the house.  I also have some watermelon seeds in the freezer and they too germinate.  I pre -plant them early so I know they are growing when the weather warms up outside.  The expiration date has a lot of variance.  The only caution is trying to save seeds from year to year if they are "hybrids".  Some of these are a "one shot"  deal.  Hope this helps.

If you must do it yourself, go with a hydraulic cement- but doubt you will be able to fully stop the leak. Hydraulic cement is only a band-aid, covering up the problem and will eventually leak again. They do sell DIY epoxy injection kits at local hardware stores, but is not as easy as one would think to try and fix. Doing anything from the outside i.e. digging down and patching- again is temporary unless doing something in conjunction on the inside- epoxy or polyurethane.|`|PE8vFmGcaa	Get some hydraulic cement from you local hardware or home improvement store. If you have the capability drill into the crack to enlarge it before filling with the cement. You will have to mix a little at a time and start from the bottom. hydraulic cement dries extremely fast so only mix as much as you can get into the crack at a time. you will even be able to fill the crack when it is wet. in fact keep a small spray bottle of water by you to keep the cement wet while you are working with it.|`|DsaYaIsGaa	Patches won't help if you don't get rid of the source of the water (downspouts, terrain/concrete sloping towards the foundation, spaces between the foundation and the patio). If you have done that, you should probably go to the professionals and prepare to get ripped.|`|KHtPan4Jaa	a 6 inch hole in diameter!? That doesn't seem right... if so, you'll need a lot more than caulk.|`|BWzsrvo5aa	Use hydraulic cement.  Go to the hardware first and read the directions on the container.  It is sold in small plastic buckets with a plastic handle.  This stuff is really nifty but tricky to use. You need to  'V' out the crack (not a huge 'V' and mix as directed. It sets very quickly and as it sets it expands.  I the leak is just small there should be no problem but if it is running water you'd better wait until the ground dries and do it in the late spring when it stops.  It'sa good idea to play with it a little first 'til you get a feel for it'sproperties.  Good Luck   If this fails, there are companies that specialize in basement cracks and you should be able to find them in your Yellow Pages.  It makes a difference whether it is a block or poured wall,  READ THE DIRECTIONS!  Don't be a hero.|`|QqWPl6x6aa	You really need to find where the water is entering under the patio and stop that first or soon. No telling where the water will go when you stop it's current travel route.<br>  As for the hole, you can use hardware cloth, a type of wire screen that is bendable enough, yet firm enough to form to fit in the hole where it will press against both the inner front and back of the cement wall if it's cement block. It will work even if it's not. Then you need to use hydraulic cement to fill over the hole and mesh. And with hydraulic cement the repair area can be wet. I use it to fix holes in ponds that still have water in them.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	Clean it out,scrape inside both sides of crack.Get hydraulic cement to put in crack/hole.I added 3 sites for you.|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	I'd try mortar caulk in the crack. It dries as hard as concrete and is the same grayish color. It's just like a tube of caulk, but it's mortar. It takes at least 2 days to dry so you want to wait until it is going to be dry outdoors for awhile.

They run about 65 dollars and you can buy them at some hardware stores or plumbing shops.  I wouldn't pay more that 70 dollars for it though.  Usually this change out should take less than an hour.  make sure when you put the new one is you dont get any dirt in the spud or union gasket or it will compromise the seal.|`|JSFCkne8aa	I would think that it is the city's responsibility to repair or replace it.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	replace it.

cff15c1430c57bf7fd07d037045ba112aa	I don't know about the talking to of plants, but for you misinformed individuals, yes there has been studies on music and plant growth, with a positive outcome. You can find the sites on the internet. Aside from that, my personal belief is that talking does not have any effect on the growth, however, music does. The reason being is that if it is played loud enough and right next to plants, they will not grow per se', but will in fact be stronger stemmed and thicker branched. This is caused by the vibration of the music (better if alot of bass). This vibration causes the plant stem and branching to shake and this in turn triggers a stimuli within the cell structure of said plant to produce more cells to keep these structures from breaking. In other words the cells fill up with fluid and the plants structure becomes more rigid and stronger over time.  Another alternative to playing music for 10 hours a day for your plants would be to...lightly tap them a couple of times every time you walk by them. This will trigger the same response as with the vibrating music. The same thing happens in nature when the wind blows branches and the tree sways back and forth during a windy day. Hope this answers your question....<br>  <br>  ...Billy Ray|`|jcs8gis8aa	Its sorta true. We breath out carbon-monoxied or dioxide (what ever) well the stuff we breath out is the stuff they breath in to make oxygen. And thats why they say it.

Very rarely do well taken care of plants (unless you are over watering) die, because if you are paying attention to them, you notice irregular growth patterns, insects, diseases, etc.<br>  <br>  (The best thing for a garden is the master's shadow means that working in a garden is a lot better than pouring a bunch of "miracle" chemicals into it).
KjQaxGX0aa	Hello   The toilet can be a tricky one it holds unspeakable bacteria and yucky matter that it would make your stomach turn if you knew. One tip for all to read you know when you flush the toilet with the lid up droplets will go over everything in your bathroom. If you have a separate room for your toilet you are very lucky.  Imagine if the droplets contain bits of diarrhea or vomit oh my god!!  Right to your answer ignore soccermom's answer for starters, the other answers aren't too bad.  Firstly what is your toilet made of and how old is it. <br>  Is it porcelain or vitreous china and is it stained.  Secondly have you checked the seal from the back of the toilet to the cistern, you know that black piece of rubber. These seals can wear out and become worn quite quickly.  Thirdly does the cistern function properly have you checked it lately, some cisterns can contain bacteria or mould I have seen it in first hand.  Fourthly when did you last take off the toilet seat completely and clean where it screws on.  Toilet seats can retain smells just like anything else don't you know.  How to take care of the smell.  Is there a window in this room if so open it now and then.  Try keeping the toilet brush if it is in a tall container in a tiny and I mean tiny amount of bleach and some disinfectant watered right down until it covers the brush.  Scrub the toilet with an enviromentally friendly product like Shower Power, I keep a bottle half water half SP never use this product neat as the makers say, you don't have to. Clean behind the toilet and check for any leaks or wear and tear.  Now here is a tip that people may not have heard of before but it works.  Buy things like lemon essence, vanilla essence, orange essence these food flavouring are very concentrated and cheap but the fragance is strong.  What you can do is put a little dish behind the toilet and put as much flavouring in as you like.  I find if you add to potpourri that helps to trap the smell longer.  I am a professional cleaner and I have had to deal with countless problems over the years I hope I have helped.  One more thing the problem could be in the floor under the toilet, or the toilet might just need replacing.  Good luck|`|1hciyvKdaa	Did you view the tank itself in back?

FlmQ2MYNaa	I really like oxiclean.  I really do think it will work - I had a stain on my white capris and it took it out after soaking over night.  I use a scoop of it with every load.  I don't think it matters if you use hot/cold water - it's going to come to room temp anyway.  <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, (but I'm sure it will) I would throw them in the washer machine on the gentle cycle.

Your ground should be leveled so water will be forced to run away from the foundation. Find the area where water is against the house and you can dig a ditch, drop in a drain line to get the water to drain away. FYI water cannot be stopped it has to run somewhere, but you can divert it the direction you want it to go.|`|OathnQfXaa	Hello.  I live in the Chicago burbs.  We have a basement that has only gotten water once in 4 years which was during those floods back in September.  You can have a couple of issues....  You could have leaky basement windows, you could have issues with your foundation, your sump pump may not work well enough to keep up with the amount of water, or there could be a drainage issue with the way your pump gets the water out of your house.  Sometimes people have the hose that leads from the sump pump to the outside yard pouring out water too close to the house, so it just comes right back in.  One other thing could be the grade of your yard.  If the lawn doesn't slope down and away from the house, you can collect too much water and it has nowhere to go.  You might have issues with gutters.  I would suggest calling in a plumber or contractor to take a look.  They have a meter thing they can use to see if there is water inside of your walls even.  Hope that helps!  If all else fails, bust out the canoe and head to Indiana.  :)
vP4S6IZTaa	First, you spoke of a ceiling fan. Stand directly under it and make sure it is spinning the correct way. Under the center of it you should feel wind blowing down onto you. If not there is a chance it is blowing the wrong way. There is usually a switch on the side that changes this. Try both ways because one is for summer use and one is for winter use. Second, any electronic item (light, t.v. even radio) produces heat. The more running the more heat you will have in your room. Third, Something you probably cannot do anything about is the insulation in the attic above your room. If it is less than the rest of the home you will get heat from the roof into your room. I would buy a fan and rig up a screen in my window, place the fan in the window blowing in and have another window in the house open. This will create a draft through your room.

DFmWVb63aa	Mark first of all it sounds like the unit is going into lockout which is a safety built into the electronics to prevent unsafe operation of the furnace. So we have to start at the basics and look at the firing sequence to see where we are losing it. Example:<br>  1. Thermostat calls for heat (same as your #1)<br>  2. Inducer motor begins running (fan motor located above the burners)  which closes a switch that tell the board its ok to fire ignitor<br>  3. Ignitor begins to glow <br>  4. Gas valve opens and allows gas to through burner tubes and ignites <br>  5. flame sensor senses the flame instantly and tells the board its ok to keep gas valve open until thermostat is satisfied<br>  6. Thermostat is satisfied and shut off gas valve <br>  7. Main blower continues to run for an additional 5 mins to cool off heat exchanger in furnace<br>  <br>  This is the cycle that repeats time and time again everytime there is a call for heat. It sounds like you need to start at #2 with the inducer motor. There is a rubber tube that is connected to the housing of the inducer motor and the other end of the tube is connected to a vacuum actuated switch with two wires connected to it. When the inducer motor is running it sucks air/carbon monoixde out of the heat exchanger and propells it into the chimney and in the process it creates a vauum in the rubber hose which closes the switch on the other end of the hose and allows the firing sequence to move on to #3. IF THIS SWITCH DOES NOT CLOSE YOU CAN NOT MOVE ON TO #3. There are several reasons which this switch would not close, so here they are.<br>  1. Bad contacts in switch or vacuum leak in switch caused from bad diaphram which does not close switch.<br>  2. Hose dry rotted and cracked and losing vacuum through cracks and agian not closing switch.<br>  3. A spider has made a home within the inducer housing and has spun a spider web within the metal orifice on the housing that the hose connects to causing a blockage of the vacuum... sounds weird I know but i have run across this before. So the moral of the story is confirm you have a good strong vacuum when the inducer motor is running and confirm switch is closing  and if this is too much for you call a hvac professional to come out and service the unit.<br>  <br>   Best of Luck !!|`|yW7CRnfOaa	LIKELY CONTROL BOARD WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO INTERMITTENT PROBLEM VERY COMMON PROBLEM<br>  IF FLASH CODE IS AVAILABLE AND IS LOCKING OUT ON FLAME FAILURE AND YOU CLEANED SENSOR THAT IS LIKELY THE PROBLEM.

dxt2qSo0aa	Its just the two of us in our house and I can do anywhere from 1 to 5 loads a day. I too change the sheets twice a week and that means two extra loads of laundry. Also in effort to be green we use cloth napkins solely so that can be a rather large load that gets washed by itself. <br>  the bulk of our laundry is clothing though. We both get up in the morning and go down to the gym. When we get home we immediately through the clothes in the washer and get that going. Neither of can stand gym clothes hanging out in the hamper getting funky! Then we change for work. When we get home from work we change and head out for the night. so we typically have three to four sets of clothing changes a day (counting nightgowns and robes) We have apartment size washer and dryer so I can only do a small load. I can fit about three standard size towels in the drum.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything wrong with how often you wash clothes.

I might have an extra load or two a week if I wash sheets/couch cover/comforter/guest room bedding...etc.<br>  <br>  So actually I guess I do around 4 loads a week.(guessing). <br>  <br>  I do have to say that, 5 to 6 times a day is a lot to be changing clothes.<br>  <br>  I do 2 loads(full) with blue jeans, tshirts, colored underwear and bras. Then, I do a load of laundry with whites and towels(brown). Med size or large, depending on amt. of laundry.<br>  If I feel it's time to wash the sheets, then that is another load. <br>  <br>  Then, the couch cover would take another load, but I don't wash that but every once and a while.<br>  <br>  Washing doing the smaller loads is probably costing you some extra money. More than that, I'm not sure how long a regular washer and dryer are supposed to last running 3 loads a day. However, I'm doing full loads and you're doing smaller ones, so I don't know how much harder that is on a machine.<br>  <br>  Most of my clothes are around the same color. They are blue, black, gray, and a few white clothes. So, I wash my tshirts with the blue jeans.

I'm an interior designer and have never even heard of silk sheets.  Satin sheets are easy to come by and would be far less expensive than those made of silk if you could find them.  The downside of satin sheets is that they don't stay on the bed very well as the fabric is kind of slippery and they don't wear well because of the weave of the fabric.  A good compromise is to get only satin pillowcases.  Because they are so slick, your hair doesn't get all jacked up during sleep and you don't wake up with bed head.|`|YXXUnKfSaa	Silk sheets can be very luxurious but challenging to care for.

OdGX5dyRaa	I love growing trees from seeds.  I've got a grapefruit tree right behind me in my office.  I don't think I've tried growing pomegranates before, but I've learned a few tips from growing other things.<br>  <br>  Is there a high chance of mold?  Yes, and that applies whether or not you keep them covered in plastic.  Mold will start to grow any place that water sits too long.  You need to keep the sprouts moist; don't let them dry out; water them regularly, but you have to keep them clean too, until they're large enough for soil.<br>  <br>  Low or high humidity isn't really a problem, as long as you keep them moist, but not sitting in built up water.  The key is watering them well enough to have a chance to absorb water frequently, but drain them soon so as not to let them sit in water and rot.  Needs to be very cyclical.<br>  <br>  I'm not so keen on putting them on the vent.  While it may be warmer, there are some problems.  The biggest is the wildly varying temperature that is probably out of bounds at times as the thermostat goes on and off.  Secondly, there's more airflow around it, which is more likely to scorch or dry out the sprouts, especially if it's too warm.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention how cold the room is, but if it's a room you live in, it should be warm enough.<br>  <br>  Sprouts are a good start, but you may do just as well planting them either soon after sprouting (when you see they're viable), or even from the start.  A good soil mixture will be much easier to keep up with, moisture-wise, and will provide nutrients that plain water can't.

944iJNAdaa	It's totally natural for any of the beetles to turn upside down after death.  Beetles are top heavy, with tiny legs by comparison, and when they die their legs curl up underneath them, and they roll over.  Even beetles that die from natural causes tend to roll over, so this is hardly unnatural.|`|OdGX5dyRaa	I hate insect spray; gross!<br>  <br>  A number of reasons come to mind.<br>  <br>  Many animals "play dead" when they feel threatened.  If the beetle is still alive, but just on its back, this may be why.<br>  <br>  Beetles are rather top heavy with their bulky backs.  The spray itself could knock them on their backs, or it might also be related to the spray making them tense up.  Their flexors being the more muscular set of muscles, their legs would be drawn inward, making themselves less steady, so that they topple onto their backs.<br>  <br>  Hope this provides some useful insight.

With another clean damp cloth, wipe over the stain until the Dawn has been removed. With a paper towel, blot the area well, then let it air dry. I have a Micro Plush couch also & most stains will come off with cold water. If it's oil, you need a degreaser, which is why I suggest Dawn dish soap.

FlsrXuJOaa	I live in an apartment with a balcony, so I know exactly what your situation is. Since I work at a garden center, I took a bunch of extra 1, 5, and 7 gallon pots and filled them with potting soil and compost. I used the 1 gallon containers for herbs, 5 gallons for tomatoes and peppers, and the larger pots for cucumbers and zucchini (with trellis) which would be good for your pumpkins. Your could either do one carrot per pot or do several carrots in a larger pot (probably a more efficient use of space) and do the same with pea plants. This way, they are mobile. <br>  <br>  The only drawback is that you have to water every day during the hot summer, because plants in pots dry out faster. The positives are that you can control the soil and micro-climate of your veggies completely, and there won't be any weeding to do! good luck :)|`|QeVG5CHAaa	Use the largest containers you can for plants.

If your draperies are installed on traverse rods, they should close with no light gap.  It's possible that the panels are not closing completely or that they are simply not wide enough for the rod.  Try overlapping the panels by hand after you close them with the rod cord.  If this doesn't work, you either need to move the ends of the rod in an inch or two on the outside edges or, if there is enough fabric, pull the inside edges of the draperies over each other by hand after closing them.

PoNzWDNEaa	As the other answers have stated it is virtually impossible to cover bleach carpet spots forever.............but you can cover them for long enough that your landlord won't be able to tell and you won't have to pay for it. Unfortunately, the next tenants will probably get blamed.<br>  <br>  Go to your local store and pick up a fabric dye (clothing) that is either a very similar match or one that is a little lighter. <br>  <br>  When you get home, don't bother with the instructions on the packet. Get some paper towel, a bowl to mix colours in, a jug of tap water and an old handtowel or dish rag.<br>  <br>  Pour a couple of cups of water into bowl, then add 1/2 a teaspoon of the clothing dye. Mix until well dissolved. Then test for a colour match using the paper towel as a guide. If it's not dark enough then add little bits until you get to your desired colour. You can always add more water if it's too dark.<br>  <br>  Using your handtowel or dish rag, gently work some of the colour into your spots. Make sure you get all the way down to the bottom of the carpet fibre. If it gets too dark use some water to dilute it on the carpet.<br>  <br>  This will last for a couple of weeks to a month as long as it isn't walked over all the time. It's best to do this after your carpets have been cleaned as the process will remove the dye.<br>  <br>  I have used this myself in countless rental houses and has always worked without fail. I have most recently done it on blue carpet and it worked well.<br>  <br>  Hope it works well for you|`|x4wRqE5Kaa	yeah, like the other answer said, the dye just doesn't stick. i've heard from people that work with carpet that you can't redye it. well, technically you can, but the dye won't last for that long. if a carpet company tries to make you believe they can dye it, it's just a scam for your money.<br>  <br>  ideally, you could replace your carpet, however that's just not practical. maybe you could find a marker that matches the color and when you have guests over just color the spots? that's the cheapest solution i could think of. sorry about your carpet and best of luck to you.|`|zxC1X9U7aa	sorry, but you will have to live with it. adding a dye will just magnify the problem as you will never match the color and by trying to dye the area, you will just have a bigger area to look at that is a different color. either replace the carpet, get an area rug or runner, or live with it. sorry, what a terrible thing...|`|AA10520442	I had the same exact problem.

KjQaxGX0aa	Hi I like Gerald L's somewhat tongue in cheek answer.  Kris S is right about soaking but not the metho, it can be detrimental to your health seriously and I wouldn't have liked to eat in that restaurant. It sounds like you have a lot of cutlery.  It all depends to on what sort of food is caked on the utensils.  To get stuck on bits off you may need to agitate or scrap them off first.  If you have a double side sink fill one with boiling water or very hot tap water and some dish washing liquid.   You need something that will break the food down, boiling water isn't enough especially on forks.  If you only have one sink then maybe use a large cooking pot as this acts like a second sink.  Agitate the water with a dish brush, wooden spoon, whisk so that you create some movement.  The action of the utensils banging causes food bits to come off.  Then let it sit for a while giving it time to desolve bits. Wait about half an hour then fill the other side of the sink with boiling or hot tap water and put everything into that and swish that around as well. Hopefully most of the food particles should have come off.  Let them drain well UPRIGHT never use a tea towel the heat from the water will be enough.  Seriously get some new roommates or just leave their stuff for them and maybe get your own set of crockery etc and teach them a lesson.  good luck|`|QEOx27CUaa	give them a soak,then pour boiling water,with a bit of metho in,into a bowl  and then dry,they will sparkle like new|`|5d798ea7982a3c1ca63d1de4de57b66faa	You could seriously consider getting a dog.

KjQaxGX0aa	Hello <br>  Have come I to the right place. Some of the answers are great. Let me fill you in about dust and where it comes from.  I am a professional cleaner and it drives me crazy but it is a part of life. <br>  Household dust comes from humans and pets and other sources like dirt lifted by wind, busy roads, fires, dirty carpets.  It is particles of solid matter no more than 500 micrometers in diameter. When dust is pale white or light gray it is okay when it is dark gray or black then it is a problem. DUST SETTLES ON EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME EVEN WALLS.  As someone suggested check the seals on your windows.  The real answer lies in how you clean your room.  Always start from the top of a room that is where a lot of dust starts believe it or not.  Use a slightly damp rag to dust and try to vacuum regularly before you dust. If the dust is pale then there is nothing wrong really.  Air your bedding as much as possible, keep clutter to a minimum, use a statically charged duster to remove dust also.  Do you live near a busy road that could be the problem as well.  One trick is to cover your music equipment with a drop sheet might not look good but it keeps the dust off, just shake out regularly.  Years ago equipment would have holes in the top to keep it ventilated which or course lead to massive dust build up.  These day a lot of holes are on the sides and back.  One more thing if you have lots of pets and other people in the house and they come into your room a lot try to reduce this it will help. Good luck and happy dusting|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Excessive dust, meaning not your normal house dust could be a sign of excessive air flow from outside. Try resealing your windows and any other areas where out side air can make its way in. Change your filters regularly on your venting system, and perform regular yearly ventilation system cleaning. This can reduce a lot of the dust.|`|AA12258992	I wish I knew, also, where all the dust comes from.<br>  <br>  It's constant.

Are the filters clean, the hoses cracked, the filter bag or the dust cup emptied when you sweep?  And it just might be time for a new sweeper!<br>  <br>  Sweepers have changed a LOT in just the last few years.  Some have sealed HEPA filtration and washable filters and offer a huge increase in suction and dust/dirt collection.  And you don't have to spend a huge amount of $$ to get a good one either!<br>  <br>  I bought a Bissell Healthy Home model because it offered sealed HEPA filtration, cyclonic cleaning action very similar to Dyson with out the high cost of a Dyson.  I got mine for $200 on sale.  And I am quite pleased with it.<br>  <br>  What told me I had made a good decision was when our middle son came for a visit a week after I got the sweeper.  He's mildly allergic to cats and we have 4.  He never sneezed!  And he still doesn't and no, he's not taking any allergy medications!  This sweeper really does gather and trap the allergens!<br>  <br>  And just because you have hard floors (wood, laminate, tile) does not mean that you don't need to use a vacuum.  All a dust mop, swiffer, whatever does is push the dirt around.  Just like a feather duster.<br>  <br>  When cleaning aim to trap and remove the dust/dirt not just move it around.  Dust with a swiffer duster, use microfiber cloths that are dampened with water and rinse frequently.  Vacuum slowly and deliberately, giving the machine time to do what it is supposed to.  <br>  After a couple of cleanings using these ideas, you should start seeing a difference.|`|79b8592899aa3dcb578c630cb4ebe264aa	I hear Ya I am a House keeper and its always a Problem.<br>  I use swiffer dusters they pick it up unlike others just seem to move it around annd back into the air. and swiffer dry floor sweepers on wood floors.I use both Endust which Repels and also Pledge .Make sure you change or clean your Filter on your heater.
n0vwabadaa	Have a plumber look at it, plumbing uses air vents, for gravity feed and something sounds off in the system, not a do it yourself job if something is off with it.  But sounds like your talking like a little bit if you can wipe it dry with a towel in which case your just expecting perfection.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	New home builders generally use the cheapest products they can find, and install them incorrectly, My guess is that your tub was not installed correctly. If water stands any place other than immediately around the drain when the water level has receded then it isn't installed correctly.|`|az0KD0POaa	Sounds like your tub wasn't installed correct or it's a really cheep tub. to check to see if your tub is level or not. use a clear glass of water and set it on the tub. the side of the tub should be level and the bottom of the tub should slanted toward the drain.|`|yig566gEaa	Most bathtubs are made to angle towards the drain but if it is an older tub then the floor may have settled unevenly. Either towel-dry it or find a way to bring the slant back. If it is settled enough to make a difference a new tub may be needed anyway
avh3kir8aa	First I'd go through everything and throw away anything you don't absolutely need to keep and maybe check out this website. I love their stuff and it's pretty reasonably priced. They have a whole section with expert advice on the best way to get your space in shape. Even if you don't order directly from them you could probably get lots of ideas and buy items close to theirs at your local home improvement store.|`|x4wRqE5Kaa	IKEA has some of the best things for organization at relatively cheap prices. you should check out their website ikea.com and see if anything is right for you. also get a label maker. if everything is labeled it's much easier to put it back where it belongs.<br>  <br>  my mom thinks that i'm insane because i label so much and i make "keys" for things like the linen closet that says where everything goes (like bath towels, kitchen towels, sheets, etc.). hey, it might be insane, but the cabinet hasn't become unorganized since.<br>  <br>  Also, once everything is clean, you and your room mates should go around the house at the end of every day and put everything back in it's place so nothing piles up again. hope that helps and good luck!|`|HxC7uvAPaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I agree with Daniel's answer.  IKEA does have some great storage components, but make sure someone knows how to assemble them.<br>  <br>  To add, have you and your roommates gone through everything to make sure there isn't anything (besides those photo/frame posters) you can get rid of, donate or sell?<br>  <br>  It's good to store things in rooms/areas they would be used, (e.g. bulk food in or near kitchen area, books where a desk or study area is), etc.<br>  <br>  For clothes, those Space Bag things look like a good idea, although I haven't (yet) gotten any.<br>  <br>  Below, is a link to those Space Bags, but also to a ton of other resources for organizing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS: You might put a picture of Martha Stewart up somewhere, and put a bubble with her saying "Stay Organized and Tidy OR ELSE!" ;)

AA10051049	Not sure what you are saying.  Does the engine continue to run when you engage the mower deck?  You say it quits when you lower the deck.  There is no safety switch for that.  A little more information would be helpful.  Have you checked to see that the blade turns freely?  If the engine is dying when you engage the blade it could be that the blade is stuck, the belt is stuck or a safety switch is bad.|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	sounds like you have a bad safety interlock switch.  There's usually 2, one on the seat, and one on the transaxle.  You must be sitting on the seat and the transaxle cannot be in reverse.  If one of these switches is bad, that would explain your problem.|`|PHlcM9YFaa	Prolly needs a new Spark Plug, have you checked it?

e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Joe,<br>  <br>  don't overlook the fact that there are now all sorts of different colored paints that are suitable for appliances.  I just painted my dishwasher with such a special paint and it turned out great.  It looks like it was originally that color when manufactured.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Get what you like. You will eventually be replacing the dishwasher and stove since it was already there and they probably have some age on them being that they are off white.<br>  My fridge broke and I bought a white one. I had an almond stove and dishwasher. The stove broke and I bought a white stove. But the DAMN dishwasher keeps working so I just painted the removable panel with white appliance paint and everything matches now. I even installed a white microwave over the stove which replaced the almond vent-a-hood. After 20 years everything finally matches!|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	you can go stainless  but mismatched appliances are not going to look good.and i wouldn't suggest getting new ones in off-white/almond either-(do they still even make them?) have you looked at the dishwasher most of the older models have a removable panel that can easily spray painted with appliance epoxy in stainless the stove can also be epoxied the stainless color one is pretty close to real stainless and is sold at all the home depot/Lowe's type stores|`|ifC0M58oaa	uhhh, you can mix colors that go good together<br>  but it'll look really tacky<br>  you could probably pull it off, but you have to do it right<br>  its confusing|`|pPr4gWXyaa	I think you could go stainless with the white appliances, thats how it s in my kitchen.

Not all white fabrics can handle chlorine bleach and the wash tag on the item will tell you when you cannot use chlorine bleach.  Once you do, the fabric will be ruined.

Sah5tjD8aa	Don't understand your question, but I hate mowing grass and I detest the high humidity when farmers in our area are irrigating.  Therefore, I do no refer to them as irrigation systems.  I call them irritation systems.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	Take another hit dude.
VWLtJoX2aa	No that is not true.  Inside a wall where there is no ventilation it will remain moist and could mold but as long as it's inside the wall it shouldn't bother you.  I would say if they don't want to do the upkeep on their building then be prepared to move.  Also, make sure you have renters insurance to cover your stuff against any water damage.|`|5rsN7VsUaa	Sam,<br>  Toxic mold grows in a no sunlight environment with a water source. For instance behind a wall with a leaking pipe, basements, crawlspaces etc etc. From your question its no doubt that toxic mold will be forming inbetween your walls. And if this is the case then you are living in an emergency situation. Toxic mold can cause severe brain damage and death. First symptoms are respiratory distress, headaches, severe fatigue, nausea, flu like symptoms, loss of hair, inability to concentrate, slurred speech and the list goes on and on. Toxic mold can grows rapidly(only days) in the right environment. Since you mentioned its been 10 months the management company is incorrect. Do not live in these conditions even for one more day. Your health should be your main concern now|`|a9HSVexoaa	yes, definitely molds take much of the time to grow... so it is not the recent past rather it took many months to reach on this situation. you need to attend your roof off and on to protect from this situation... <br>  <br>  Now the only solution is to use some coating materials to overcome this problem.|`|5NAwX919aa	mold and moisture go hand in hand. If it is consistantly wet it will mold. eg. a house with high humidity with a coach or bed against the wall, will typically cause mold if left long enough in absence of air. <br>  <br>  I would notify them about the condition and set a timeline for them to get it fixed. If timeline not met. consider reducing rent payment and or not paying at all.|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	I wouldn't fall that BS, mold is some nasty stuff.

944iJNAdaa	The commercial buildings I've worked on use 5/8 drywall for fire regulations, and they're not required to be insulated as well as homes.  They tend to have more metal studs and use of metal in general, not that it's required, but maybe it's faster to work with.  All the exterior doors are installed so they swing outward (instead of in, like houses), so if people need to leave in a hurry (like in a fire), they don't all pile up at the exits.  Bathrooms have to be accessible to disabled users, with grab bars and special fixtures sometimes.  Parking lots have to be specially designed, with disabled parking spots located near entrances.  The fire marshal has to approve access around the building for fire department use, and sometimes hydrants are required to be installed.  Fire extinguishers are required inside, too, and they have to be reinspected regularly.  I don't think it's a legal requirement, but ceilings tend to be suspended. with utilities often above.  There's probably a lot more differences, but those are the first ones that occur to me.  :)|`|KDpR83oVaa	Actually the biggest difference between the two are the specifications that are posed for safety.  Number of exits, width of hallways etc. These are all determined based on the occupancy of the building etc.<br>  <br>  The specifications surrounding insulation is the same based on the region.  The "R" Values required are going to be based on the climate.  Same goes for the structural part,  A house in Edmonton is going to face the same climate changes, wind loads and snow loads ans a commercial building so they must be built to with stand them regardless of the types of materials used.  A house in Edmonton will have a greater "R" Value then one build in  Miami but the house in Miami will require different measures because of the potential wind loads.<br>  <br>  The use of material differ but the building practises are essentially the same.|`|zAhBlMQLaa	Both need to have a building permit as well as building plans for review and approval. I think they defer on how they are process and the amount you were going to pay.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Commercial buildings must meet tougher occupancy/evacuation <br>  standards and generally require higher fire rated materials.<br>  Commercial occupancy is divided into many types, and different <br>  standards apply for different uses.<br>  Fire alarms and sprinklers may be required, as well as higher <br>  ventilation and plumbing standards.<br>  Sorry but, even the 'commercial occupany definitions' portion <br>  of the codes makes a pretty thick book.|`|FRJCqN0daa	in a building you have to use heavy materials depend how big it is ..in a house is the same thing  everything is about the safety matters also the codes depend about the area, latitude.  environment,altitude etc etc example.you need sprinkles in a buildings..but you need  smoke detector  in houses for fire protection..also you need a rear  door  emergency escape on both

Poison ivy is a woody vine.

Unfortunately I can't identify it for you, but it's not poison ivy.

Poison sumac (not "sue mac") sounds most likely, because of the height you mentioned.

WThYT17Iaa	I have the J.A. Henckels sets of knives that are just standard quality and I also have the chef-grade knives. The standard quality (steak knives and such) are fine to put in the dishwasher. I didn't really notice a difference and they seem to be fine. The chef grade knives (the ones that cost around $100-150 each) I don't put into the dishwasher just because they were so expensive, I don't want to take the chance.|`|RD05jXYwaa	i don't think they will explode but you will dull their sharpness. but this is an personal preference thing. you don't care i don't care. tmm|`|bKVy6Dv3aa	I would NOT put those expensive knives in the dishwasher.  Wash them in hot, soapy water and dry them.  Store them in a wooden block or on a magnetic knife rack.  The prolonged heat in a dishwasher will affect the handles and the finish on the blades.
OdGX5dyRaa	Oak is perhaps the most popular type of shade tree, but it's not exactly fast growing or that useful.  I would recommend some kind of fruit tree.  Bummer that you didn't like your mango trees.  Maybe you can find better mango trees?<br>  <br>  Another possibility is citrus.  There are various kinds of citrus that grow pretty quickly, given plenty of water and sunlight.<br>  <br>  If speed of growth is most important, you might consider another way of looking at this.  Eucalyptus trees aren't good shade trees, but if you plant them in a row around the perimiter of your yard, they will provide some measure of shade or filtered sunlight when the sun isn't directly overhead.<br>  <br>  You'll have to be the best judge of what's right for your home, but you might want to ask the opinion of the nursery workers.  They know a lot about trees and how well they grow in your area.  You can even take pictures and/or a soil sample with you when getting their opinions.|`|sI8vLjjZaa	Do you want the tree just for shade or do you also want fruit?<br>  <br>  Anyway the fastest growing trees in the world are eucalyptus trees. Just keep in mind they also grow very large.<br>  <br>  At a previous place I lived I planted a silky oak tree, which grew very fast. You can buy these at your local nursery and they are also native to Australia. It’s a nice ornamental tree.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that even a fast growing tree will grow slowly if the soil conditions are not right for it. You got to have the correct soil PH and nutrients present for the tree to perform.|`|AA10520442	Pawlonia is fast growing but I don't know if it is hardy in AU.<br>  <br>  It is covered in purple blooms in the springtime.|`|MlhiDi8paa	Avocado trees grow fast and you'll still have the fruits.<br>  :)

Ideal temp for sprouting is eighty degrees and if it gets below about sixty they will just lay there and rot.  They are harder to start and take longer to sprout than most vegetables so don't give up on them.  A plant heating pad is ideal.  Watering from below usually means using a soaker hose or flood irrigating as opposed to using a sprinkler.  Wet plants can lead to diseases.  All of the seed catalogs offer pepper varieties that are short season, maturing in less time than other, larger types.  If you start them six to eight weeks before the last frost, you should be able to get lots of peppers, even with a short growing season.  Peppers also do pretty well in pots if you use large enough pots to keep them from getting root bound.  A three gallon or bigger pot is recommended.  You may want to take a look at <br>  gardenhbbies.com or any of the dozens of gardening sites on the web.|`|MbUXTe0oaa	I live in Georgia and last year my parents grew jalepeno peppers. What they did was plant them in a row and next to it they carved out a small line running parallel to the row and stuck the water hose on the end and let the water run down to the plants. Those plants thrived and we had tons of peppers. They're really not that hard to grow.. out here at least. And they grow to be a decent sized plant so if you're going for growing it in a pot I recommend a big pot.|`|de72fa747bd877831a656fc97e91fc1baa	here is what you do.  start your pepper seeds in peat pellets.  they are about the size of a half dollar and expand in water.  after they expand, put a couple pepper seeds in each one. 1/4 inch is more than deep enough.  now put the peat pellets on a dish or cheap aluminum pan and cover with some plastic wrap.  you are done.  once the seeds come up, remove the plastic wrap.  watering from below is just simply putting some water in the pan with the pellets and they will soak up the water as needed.  simple.  just add a little water to the pan as needed.  they wont need any sun or light until they sprout.

"The rewarding part of cultivating culinary herbs in Florida is that most of them thrive in the worst soil, so the sandy and acidic Florida dirt is not a problem. As a matter of fact, I have found that some of the kitchen herbs do poorly in improved soil, particularly oregano, thyme, catnip, rosemary, and rose geranium.<br>  <br>  Sage and lavender struggle in the Florida heat humidity, but they have both fared better in the rock garden. Dig in extra sand when you plant these and similar plants and then spread sand around under the leaves and stems to keep the area from holding too much moisture. If you like lavender in your Florida herb garden, consider the Goodwin Creek cultivar, which fares well in the humidity here. And be realistic, there are some culinary and cultivated medicinal herbs that you can only grow in the winter months: cilantro and chamomile, for instance":<br>  <a href="http://www.myherbalnotebook.com/2008/07/a-florida-rock-garden/" rel="nofollow">http://www.myherbalnotebook.com/2008/07/...</a><br>  <br>  Video on growing Rosemary.

Make a selection based on this question and on your available space.  If you have limited space a culinary herb garden in a big pot should include parsley, chives, oregano, garlic and basil (in summer).  Different mints are good for teas and other cooking but don't grow them with parsley and keep mint plants moist.  Get a book on companion planting and if you have the area, plant herbs with your vegetables, e.g basil with tomatoes.<br>  Enjoy your herbs.

I good place to go is Uzi-talk forum and these guys know what they are talking about if you have a question. From what I have gathered, the magazine wells on the receiver(ORF) were not milled out enough for the Orlites. So all you have to do for your Orlites to fit is slightly modify them by sanding them down and they then should be a perect fit. If you don't want to sand them, simply just keep inserting and ejecting them until you have worn them out so they fit. Hope this helps and enjoy your gun!

KjQaxGX0aa	MY ANSWER IS THE BEST BY FAR AND MAKES THE MOST SENSE.<br>  <br>  Hello.  Where to begin some the answers you have are on the money.  I am a professional cleaner and I have worked in some very nice hotels, motels and some not so nice.  The reason I mention this is that some establishments I have seen things that would turn your stomach.  For example two very up market places would use the guests towels to clean the bathrooms and the tea towels to clean the kitchens.  I never once saw any cleaning rags or cloths. It makes you think what if a guest had some sort of skin disorder and it was passed on to someone else(they were breaking the law really).  I don't even think about the kitchen it makes me sick.  I didn't stay at these places.  Another hotel would throw the mops in with the cleaning rags can you imagine the combination, revolting.  Your theory about being clean is right and the towel is only used for a short time and hangs innocently until if gets used again.  Is the towel yours and yours alone or do others use it and do you know.  In our house we tend to stick to our own towels and use clean ones every couple of days unless we are sick or are contagious with something.  You shouldn't wait 2 weeks at all!  You body may be clean but everytime you wipe your body all over your towel picks up things.  For example from your private parts which is always excreting things, your scalp dandruff which is not dead as some people think but a living bacteria OW!  Your feet, under your arms, your eyes, ears if you clean wipe them them out.  Towels are designed to be washed the more they are the better they become(not the cheap ones sorry).  Here's something to think about I presume the toilet is in the bathroom.  Everytime you flush with the lid up the droplets get on all the surfaces in the bathroom<br>  from your toothbrush, hairbrush to your towel(scientific fact).  Imagine if someone has the runs of has vomited or something worse.  Consider using a new towel at least every couple of days and whoever does the washing add a small amount of disinfectant to the water every wash makes a real difference.  cheers and best wishes|`|SsfnitjXaa	I replace my towel about every three days.  When you dry off you sloff off dead skin cells.  Mites love to eat the dead skin.  That is why I change towels.

There are some varieties of oak that are evergreen, but many types also shed their leaves in the fall.  Take one of the leaves to a nurseryman and he should be able to tell you for sure if its a live oak-because even some of the leaves look somewhat similar.  I have three different types of oak in my yard, but only one is evergreen.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Oaks are one of the slowest growing trees.<br>  That's why the wood is so dense.<br>  Give it some time.<br>  Mine shed its leaves every year too..<br>  <br>  Great picture by the way..|`|AA11498082	Live oaks are Evergreen and Do Not drop their leaves.

Not a big deal on small stuff which is why they don't put switches on certain things. But if it has an on/off switch it's better to turn it off before unplugging.

We went over my likes and dislikes to give them an idea and a place to start.  They designed my entire house, 6 bedrooms, 2 living rooms, a large formal dinning room, breakfast area, sitting room, 2 home offices, the main kitchen and the prep kitchen, they also worked with my garage designer to have a the garage and workshop flow with the rest of the house.  One of the members on the team of 5 laid out my landscape to work with the pool and water falls.  They rapped all this up with a wonderful front gate and all outside light fixtures.  Everything came out great.  They had the house design plan done in just over 2 weeks and had the house done in 3 months.  Total for their work and time was less than $40K.  They stayed only went over budget by $17K not bad considering the size of the project.<br>  I am a typical 26 year old guy who would rather manage my company than pick out fabric or tile.  I highly suggest finding someone who is a professional to help you or guide you through the process.  My fiance's design was going to cost us $96K more than the final overall costs.  So in the end we saved money.<br>  Obviously there are people who will so smaller jobs and at a lower cost.  I had someone do my first condo and they only charged me $1,200 for their time.<br>  Decorating is something that anyone can learn.  It takes experience and one needs to know what is available when planning out their project.  I would suggest reading as many mags. as possible and looking at other homes that share the same feeling that you are looking for.  Good luck.
yMHb1quhaa	I would agree with William that the electric chainsaw is "safer" for the environment but you can't necessarily say that there are no pollutants.  The electricity for an electric chainsaw had to come from somewhere and most likely there was some pollution generated from that process unless it came from a wind turbine or hydroelectric plant. <br>  <br>  However, even if it came from other sources such as coal, gas or nuclear you would probably be safe to say that the amount of pollution generated from these sources was less than what would be generated by a standard gas powered chainsaw.  Two stroke engines are notoriously inefficient and are almost never tuned-up well enough to burn cleanly.<br>  <br>  I guess someone might make the argument that nuclear is less safe due to the radioactivity of the spent fuel but I'm working under the assumption that the comparison is being made when everything is working right for all of the sources of energy.    |`|3W18HDxxaa	yes<br>  there's no pollutants to enter the air|`|944iJNAdaa	Ask your teacher about the environmental damages caused by dragging all those extension cords through the woods. :)<br>  <br>  Don in Oregon|`|AA10349442	An electric chainsaw has MUCH less power than the smallest gasoline powered saw.  This results in running the electric saw much longer than the gas powered one. <br>  <br>  Generating electricity with coal, gas, or nuclear power also generates pollution.  Same can be said for manufacturing batteries, insulated wire, wind turbines and solar panels.  <br>  <br>  The chain of a saw requires constant lubrication with either cheap dino produced oil or expensive canola-dino blended oil.  The electric saw will spew much more oil onto the ground than the gas simply because it will run longer to do the same work. <br>  <br>  Using an alternate energy source often creates different problems rather than eliminating problems.  i.e.  Gas saws pollute the air in your immediate area while electric saws pollute the air around power plants. <br>  <br>  To actually say one is more environmentally friendly than the other would be short sighted at best. <br>  |`|l2c2SXVSaa	Do your own homework.  Research is an enlightening tool.<br>  <br>  One would have to consider how the electric energy is generated as well as how fossil fuels are refined and what emissions the burning of fuel creates.<br>  <br>  Obviously, not cutting down trees at all is safest for the environment.

There are installation manuals here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.findanyfloor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.findanyfloor.com/</a><br>  <br>  on every type of floor. DO NOT use laminate in your basement. It isn'r recommended for below grade installations. I would recommend something water resistant... maybe rubber (sounds cheap- $ wise yes-very affordable, the look of rubber comes in ALL types patterns, colros etc.) rubber would be good because it is durable to water... maybe see what your options are by clicking the link above... you can also use a flooring estimator and see how much you'll exactly need so you aren't left with tons extra! Just some help! Hope it's helpful to you!!!
PpXckxtsaa	Unfortunately you can't get rid of stretch marks once you have them. However, you can reduce the 'ugliness' of them. Buy a bottle of Vitamin E tablets, pierce the pill and rub the oil directly onto the stretch marks. Sun also helps the vitamin E work better but don't go into the sun straight after you put it on or you will burn instantly. In a few months you will notice a big difference in the appearance as the stretch marks fade. They will eventually fade back to the colour of your skin so they are hardly noticeable. I hope this helps.|`|GLVMTMPfaa	I know this doesn't help you right now but they do fade over time on their own.

SaCMyfHPaa	There could be a few things wrong with your situation there, <br>  most pressure switches are factory set at 30/50.  Pump turns on at 30psi and off at 50.  Shut off the vavle after your pump so you can try to isolate the problem.  Watch the pump build up to pressure, it should stop at 50 unless its been changed.  If it doesnt build good pressure there could be a problem with the pumps impellar, or the vari nozzle. if there is blockage in the nipple  going to the press switch this could also cause this problem.  If you can get the pump running properly then open the valve to the house and make sure the pump shuts off.  <br>  Too much to write, I would start with trying to isolate it in the pump house then go from there|`|cRxoNPYkaa	Could be several things.  Your pressure tank could have a flat air bladder.  You could have a serious leak somewhere.  Your pump could be worn out.  Your pressure cut out could be malfunctioning.<br>  <br>  I'd need more information to make that diagnosis, or to even get close.<br>  <br>  First, do you have good water pressure?  Then your pump probably isn't worn out, but it will be soon - running 24/7 like that. <br>  <br>  Second, do you have a shutoff valve just downstream of your pressure tank?  Close it.  Does that make the pump stop?  If so, you have a major leak somewhere.  Start digging, I guess.  If that doesn't work, 2 possibilities are that your pump is worn out and can't produce enough pressure to trip the cut out switch, or the switch itself is broken and never signals the control box that you have reached cutout pressure.<br>  <br>  Let me explain the function of a bladder tank.  Pressure and bladder tanks provide a air cushion that produces water pressure in your system so your pump doesn't kick on every time you draw a glass of water.  a bladder tank has a neoprene membrane in the center.  As the pump puts water into the bottom half of the bladder tank the membrane  compresses the air in the top half.   When the pressure reaches the cut off point in the control box the pump shuts down.  However you still have between 40 to 50 pounds of pressure pushing the water out to your system. As the pressure drops in the tank when you make a draw the pump kicks on and everything starts over again.<br>  To check, take something metal and start rapping at the bottom of the tank and work upwards.  You will hear a "clunk" in the bottom half full of water.   On the upper half you should hear a "clink" because the upper half should have nothing but air in it.  IF the sound doesn't change or changes close to to tank top then the bladder tank must be replaced.  Your air setting on the tank should be 2 pounds UNDER the cut in point in the pressure control box. If your pressure control has a 20 PSI cut in and 40 PSI cut out the tank pressure should read 18 PSI. Shut the pump off and drain the system down.  Now check the tanks pressure.  Make sure it's 2 PSI under the cut in point and pressure the system back up.|`|EZMkioAgaa	The pressure switch is bad...or the ball valve near the tank bottom is..valve has a line running from high to low ..usually copper, or the well is dry.

It comes in very handy, because I check my clean out twice a year now to make sure it's flowing properly and if it's not I call and have them come out and clear the line. Then, I have them treat the line with the root treatment stuff.|`|AA11160979	go to hardware store and buy any septic root killer solution and pour it in toilet pronto|`|AA11519830	You can buy chemicals that you flush down the toilet that will attack the roots but they are harmful to the tree.  Another solution is to call a plumber and ask him to install a t joint in between the tree and your house.  That will allow a plumber to access your main line and pull out the roots more easily.  Or you can always remove the tree. No matter how many time you use a chemical treatment the roots will come back.  and it's cheaper to hire a plumber to clean the main if you have a T joint.

The difference is critical to the proper answer. WIthout that infomation, you will only get generic answers, not what you really need to know.<br>  <br>  <br>  You need a separate receiver for each television. You also have a different piece on the dish, depending on how many televisions you will have. Since you have to rent these from the satellite company, few people actually have that many of them. This is very different than cable television.<br>  <br>  There is an excellent chance the signal booster will not work on satellite. Satellite signals are MUCH broader band than regular television cable so the booster must be made specifically to work with that.|`|306c27b7faa3c82ce6ed07ed184fb1e6aa	If all you want to do is view and control your satellite channels around the house, the easiest way is using digi sender units which can be bought from Argos at around ￡80. You plug the sender unit into the output from the satellite box, attach the receiver to another TV via scart (more receiver units can be added) and hey presto, Satellite channels in another room minus the hastle of running loads of cables.<br>  The receiver comes with a "magic eye" which, when placed in front of your satellite box means you can change channels from the other room. Unfortunately, you can only watch the same channel in all rooms, if you want to watch different channels you will need to contact your provider because you need a different head unit on the satellite dish, plus another decoder box.
