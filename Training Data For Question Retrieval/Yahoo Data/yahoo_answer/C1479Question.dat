Su muerte le produjo una gran depresión y despertó en Charles ansiedad y/o pánico por la suerte de sus otros hijos, “potencialmente perdibles”, como le ocurrió con el embarazo de Emma. Temía que hubieran heredado de él un mal gástrico fatal, lo que no estaría lejos de la creencia de que él también lo había heredado, contribuyendo a sus propios miedos a la muerte y mostrando una identificación con su madre.-   Annie falleció en Malvern, un instituto de cura al cual Darwin solía concurrir. Su tumba se encontraba en ese lugar y Darwin sufrió uno de sus peores períodos de enfermedad luego de una visita a la ciudad y tomar conocimiento del estado de la tumba de su hija. Cuando se encontraba próximo a viajar a Malvern se hallaba deprimido, pero cuando llegó sufrió un colapso.-.-.-DTB.-.-.-.

EFE - viernes, 20 de junio, 02.21Washington, 19 jun (EFE).- El polvo cósmico que dio origen a la Tierra y a los otros planetas del sistema solar fue mucho más denso de lo que se creía, según un estudio realizado por científicos estadounidenses que divulgó hoy la revista Science.-   Esa pista sobre el origen de la Tierra fue arrojada por el análisis del contenido de sodio en un meteorito que cayó en Semarkona, India, en 1940, realizado por geólogos de la Institución Carnegie, el Museo Americano de Historia Natural y el Instituto Geológico de EE.UU.-   Ese meteorito, como otros que contienen granos de sodio (cóndrulos), data de las primeras etapas del nacimiento del sistema solar hace 4.600 millones de a?os, según los científicos.-   Agregan que, a diferencia de otros meteoritos, sus elementos no fueron modificados por el calor o por los cambios químicos durante más de cuatro mil millones de a?os, "lo cual abre una ventana a la historia inicial de nuestro sistema solar".

I DO NOT want to install it and i would rather have some things slow and crap than EVERYTHING crash.       anyway, he said "that shouldnt happen" when everything crashed and all i say is "well it DID". this happened last time i tried to improve things and it couldnt be fixed, except with this device, which in turn POTENTIALLY MAY FIX ONE THING but fooks up other things i need and am not willing to sacrifice at this point.       i told him i would install it today and never have. he said he would try to fix it for me if it crashed - ie if it messes up other things- and said, "it shouldnt, it wont" etc etc but i dont want it to crash at all to have someone have to TRY to fix it.       he KNOWS what hes doing but my comp is just too QUIRKY and doesnt behave as it should or react to things as it should. i dont want to fook with it more. i can learn to live with the handicaps for now.       i DONT want him to think im ignoring his help as hes VERY helpful, but i am not risking my comp die on me. especially as when i start to install it and it screwed up he says "well that shouldnt happen". i dont want him to think im irrational or ignoring his help. but from past experience my gut instinct is no.       WHAT DO I SAY TO HIM NEXT TIME I SPEAK TO HIM as to why i wont do it and i wont let him either? i said i would install it at noon and get back to him lol       yeah my system may suck now and have its faults  and risks of dying but its not dead like the risk if i install this.

20090203133306AAe62Wg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, riddle me this..........................…	How can you attack the Bible by saying it's silly WHEN silly is a relative term?      For example, certain cultures and customers may appear to be silly to an outsider.      Some of you (NOT all) attack us for believing in the power of prayer by saying that we believe:      "God uses his special powers to telepathically communicate with Christians and tell them what he wants and that even though not all Christians agree on what God wants and sometimes there are big contradictions between Christians, an individual Christian knows what God telepathically told them is correct and that the other Christian is wrong because they have faith and God lets them know that their faith that their faith is correct lets them know what is true."      --------------------------------------...      Here's the thing. This is a mischaracterization of the facts. There are NO major contradictions between Christian denomations. There are only minor ones.       Also, what APPEARS to be silly is based on how it's PRESENTED.      For example, evolutionists LITERALLY believe we are related to bananas because they believe ALL life evolved from a common ancestor.  See how sillly that sounds WHEN it's presented that way?      So, how can you say Christianity is silly when silly is a relative term in relation to your experiences?

20090203133806AAsKzg7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: What do you live for?	Atheists believe there is no God. So, there's no afterlife. We just live out our lives and at some point we die. We just blink out into nothingness. So what's the point of living? Knowing that no matter what you do with family, friends, possessions, career, in the end you just die and rot.    And part 2 of this question is, what keeps you in line? Why follow the rules if you don't fear punishment? If someone really made you mad, would you be more likely to kill them, because there's no hell for you and you feel it's justified?    Finally, part 3: At some point in everyone's life, most people turn to God in prayer for something; relative died, serious disease, severe injury, etc. Who do atheists turn to when family and friends just aren't enough?      Those who answer all 3 parts get a thumbs up, even if I disagree with their answer.

I was going a bit slow because I was driving somewhere I had never been.  Last I checked there was no car but then suddenly when I changed lanes, it was there.  I signaled and checked behind me as I was moving into the other lane but it was too late.  I do not think I would have ever hit the car because of the fact that I still did check behind me.  Just as I began to move they honked their horn.  Not just a simple honk but a long laying on the horn kind of honk.  Isn't this a little too much?  I know I made a mistake.  I have always had the respect to just do a simple short honk because I understand people make mistakes.  Why do people have to be so mean?  Why does hiding inside a car make it OK to forget courtesy and forgiveness?  Why have we become a nation of mean drivers?  Have you ever had this happen to you?

I really like asians but I like big boobs as well and, this isn't a stereotype, but MOST asians are flat. Which leads me to wonder, why do I like asians anyways? Is it because of their face? I think that they're skin is really soft and they have no acne compared to other races. I guess because they have cute faces also because of their small eyes and soft, baby type skin. Is it because of their personality? Asians seem fun but I don't know if that's true because i've never gone out with one. But anways, what are asians known for, physically and personality wise. Do MOST asians ( stereotype crazy people out there ) have small boobs? Do most have small butts? Do most have nice curves?

20090203134122AAbYFvr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So long everyone, I'm off to the real world?	(not a question so I'm sure it won't stay on here long. Please be gentle Yahoo...)      I've decided to say goodbye. I've tremendously enjoyed my time here, but that time has been too much. I am suffering from Real Life Syndrome pretty hard, seeing as I have a job as a teacher. I always want to know what's going on here when I get home,  even if I'm really to tired to.      I might be back someday. I have half a mind to write a novel with a religious theme (I thought it would be an interesting idea to imagine Paul was a former Mithraist - perhaps kicked out even. I don't believe it's true but it could be and would have interesting consequences... anyway back to now), and my promise to myself is I won't be back until that is finished. Which probably means this is goodbye for good.      I know that Yahoo answers is pretty much the most degenerate part of the internet, and that R&S may be the most degenerate part of that. But I never minded that, in fact I loved the fact that you have to stoop to the lowest common denominator sometimes, and that at other times you have to accept being misunderstood. The lowest common denominator has a bad reputation, and I'm not sure if that's always justified.      Anyway, rock on everyone. I considered leaving some comments here or pming some people but I won't. I'll just leave you with the wise words of Jeffrey Lewis:      "You say you got a heavy heart   And its hard for you to start   Carrying your heavy old home      You say you got a heavy load   Walking down the road   Carrying your heavy old heart      And you sure dont know, where you're going      But I say   The sun dont know, when its glowing   The flower dont know, when its growing   The river dont know, when its flowing      You're doing better than you know"      Blessed be/Namaste/God bless you/may the Force be with you/May you be touched by his noodly appendages/Live long and prosper
20090203065642AAnvwPX	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Hypothetical situation about mermaids and reproduction: What happens when her water breaks?	I had posted a question about mermaids and sex.      Show named H2O (Just Add Water) is about these 3 girls who encountered a mysterious force that turned them into mermaids.  When they are dry, they have legs and are completely human.  When they get wet, they turn into mermaids.      The previous question asked about their being human and then turning into a mermaid while having sex, what would happen with the guy.      Now, the question is, if she's pregnant and then her water breaks, does she turn into a mermaid?  What about when she's sweating during the birthing process, would that cause her to turn into a mermaid and then complicate the birth?

20080803052110AAbY0uq	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Què`piensan de un paìs asi?	Israel: la paradoja entre el orgullo y la imagen         Un artículo divulgado por la Cancillería israelí informó que hay una paradoja entre la contribución de Israel al mundo y la imagen que se difunde de este país, lo que indica que “la industria de la mentira está ganando por sobre todas las cosas”.       El periodista Ben Dror Yeminin se?aló en un artículo difundido por el gobierno de Israel esta semana que “la industria de la mentira está ganando por sobre todas las cosas” ya que, según el autor, existe una paradoja entre la contribución de Israel al mundo y la imagen que se da de este país.       Además, Yeminin se?aló que es hora de presentar el “verdadero Israel, uno que puede celebrar su 60 aniversario orgullosamente debido a su enorme contribución a la humanidad”.       Las contribuciones que se mencionan en el artículo concluyen que Israel es uno de los países líderes en agricultura, alta tecnología, medicina y ciencia.    En agricultura, Israel es líder mundial en el desarrollo de cosechas especiales resistentes a duras condiciones meteorológicas.                    Teva: investigaciones científicasde alto nivel          Además, el Estado inventó el sistema de riego por goteo que permite ahorrar gran cantidad de agua, la leche que produce es la mejor del mundo -hasta dobla el promedio europeo- y el árbol de la palmera en el país produce alrededor de 182 kilogramos de fruta, comparado a los 17 kilogramos obtenidos en el resto de Medio Oriente.       Con respecto a la alta tecnología, el informe se?aló que una parte importante de los desarrollos mundiales en este área son inventos israelíes, como el programa de mensajes instantáneos ICQ, el mejor software de seguridad del mundo, la mayoría de los sistemas operativos de Windows XP que son utilizados por la mayor parte de las computadoras en el mundo y la tecnología VOIP -la base de programas como Skype que simplificaron el sistema de llamadas internacionales a través de computadoras-.                 ICQ, el mensajero virtual que conquistó el mundo          Asimismo, Israel se encuentra en el tercer lugar en el ranking de publicaciones científicas mundiales por persona y es el quinto país con mayor número de jóvenes investigadores becados por el Concejo de Investigación Europeo.       En medicina, la empresa israelí Teva es la compa?ía más grande del mundo en remedios genéricos y, junto con otras, ha inventado diversas drogas, como la que trata la enfermedad de Parkinson, y tratamientos como el que reduce la recaída de la esclerosis múltiple.       Según Yeminin, la mayoría de los informes mundialmente difundidos perciben a Israel como “el país más peligroso para la paz mundial” y los medios omiten mencionar la contribución del país para el desarrollo humano.    “Se puede criticar a Israel, no todas sus acciones son loables”, se?aló el periodista, “pero es hora de presentar el verdadero Israel”.       “Israel no necesita un desfile militar. Necesita un desfile de sus logros. Lo podríamos llamar el Desfile del Orgullo”, agregó.

20081028193043AArYzda	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it wrong to call myself christian if...?	I wanted to know what you guys think.(its really long but please read and help! and i know i am missing some details but i am trying to make this as short as possible) Is it wrong to call myself Christian if I don't believe everything in the bible/religion(stories)? its kind of hard to explain:      1. I don't believe that God can hate people just cause they are gay. I think its dumb. Isn't he suppose to be all loving? how can he hate? and if he does hate someone just cause of something like that, then how is that love in the first place? is like a mom saying to her kid "I love you but if you don’t do as I say I’m throwing you in the fire place"      2. heaven and hell: ok the story of hell is that an angel (Satan) became greedy and wanted gods power. God banished him from heaven so Satan went down and created hell.   for one: angels are supposed to be pure creations of god. they don't feel Petty emotions like greed/hate/jealousy etc. they are filled with nothing but gods light.   two: god knows everything that he creates. he knows them from the inside out, so he knows your soul etc.      anyway my point is: since angels are so pure how can they become jealous of gods power? and since god created them and created Satan doesn't that mean that he purposely created a 'flawed angel'? since god is suppose to know everything he creates and since angels are suppose to be pure (and having bad emotions is being impure) does that make any sense at all? how can something pure, surrounded by other things that are pure, become corrupt?      3. Adam and eve: the story of this is that god created one man and woman basically out of thin air. and they ended up betraying god by eating from a tree that they weren't suppose to because of a talking snake (Satan) tempted them. ( I’m trying to make this as short as possible). I don’t believe that man just appeared out of no where, there is too much proof saying man evolved from apes. I thought maybe god created man through evolution, but that doesn’t sound quite right either.      I believe that there is something greater out there that created everything else, but I just don’t know what to call myself. Christian? spiritual? please be nice! I’m really confused here. my mom gets really angry when I try to talk to her about it and starts crying cause she raised me to be Christian and I question it. Please help!!! I think its wrong for me to call myself something if I don’t believe it entirely, kind of like a 'fake' or something. Am i thinking too much about it? too critical?

20080817230950AADe9XQ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Sobre peregrinajes espirituales y demás yerbas...?	De nacimiento me metieron al catolicismo arrancándome un llanto cuando un cura eunuco me mojo la frente con agua fría.   A?os mas tarde me mandaron a catecismo, donde otro cura de aspecto pervertido me ense?aba cosas de las cuales no comprendía absolutamente nada.   Luego llegaron las aburridísimas misas y mas tarde el rito de la comunión   Ya era un completo católico   Seguí creciendo y busque la espiritualidad que no había encontrado en mi herencia cultural apostólica romana. Así que ingrese a un grupo del Gurú Maharaji.   La libertad sexual de sus miembros era algo que valoraba, no así sus cabezas huecas. Por lo tanto seguí buscando y después de un tiempo de aproximación al judaísmo, me di cuenta de que este tampoco tenia sentido, sobre todo cuando me hablaron de cortarme un cacho de carne.   Mi peregrinaje espiritual me llevo a los evangelistas pentecostales que me aceptaron de buen grado.   Primero me hicieron cortar el pelo, ya que la biblia dice… A mi novia no le gusto el cambio de look.   Luego me inhibieron de mantener relaciones sin estar casado, motivo por el cual mi novia me dejo definitivamente.   Las ceremonias pentecostales cual orgía de gritos, violentos ademanes y gente hablando en lenguas raras comenzaron a irritarme, así que me acerque a los mormones a quienes veía mas tranquilos. Así me convertí en un inútil de aspecto impecable, siempre acompa?ado por otro “hermano” que con el tiempo comenzó a mirarme demasiado cari?osamente.   Decidí dejar el cristianismo y “orientarme” o mejor dicho: volcarme a filosofías orientales.   A partir del Tao concebí un mundo donde imperaba el vacío. Mis amigos aceptaban que en casa no tuviera sillas, pero no toleraban la idea de que ni siquiera tuviera platos para comer. Decidí que había ido demasiado lejos con todo esto, así que busque la espiritualidad en algo mas terrenal y me inscribí en una escuela de Kung Fú.   En el primer torneo me enfrente a un chinito que me dejo fuera de juego a la tercera patada en los ri?ones.   Después de orinar sangre por tres días y por consejo de mi ex novia, abandone dicha practica.   Esto marcó un quiebre dentro mío y fue ahí cuando ingrese al mundo del psicoanálisis.   La sicóloga me diagnostico “depresión”, por lo cual un psiquiatra me medicó con pastillas de colores. Unas para dormir, otras para la serotonina, otras para regular no se que cosa…   Mientras mis fondos disminuían incrementando el de los médicos, viví un tiempo babeante y confuso pero despreocupado.   Un día le dije a mi sicóloga que quería dejar el tratamiento.   -Dese cuenta que su problema es que no puede terminar nada de lo que comienza....!!! - escuche lejanamente mientras bajaba por el ascensor…      Tal vez tenia razón… No se como terminar este relato…

La Asociación Médica Estadounidense ha llamado al suicidio médico "una catástrofe endémica" y hace dos a?os se comprometió a trabajar para prevenir este problema.      Pero los suicidios han continuado. Por ello, la Fundación Estadounidense para la Prevención del Suicidio ha lanzado una campa?a educativa con esperanzas de hacer que los doctores atribulados estén más dispuestos a buscar ayuda.      La fundación, el Colegio Estadounidense de Psiquiatras y los laboratorios Wyeth, un fabricante de antidepresivos, han financiado el programa, mismo que contempla un documental titulado "Luchando en silencio", que comenzará a ser transmitido por canales de televisión pública esta semana."      Las cifras de suicidio en la población en general no son completamente confiables porque muchas veces no se indica en la causa de muerte que la persona se quitó la vida "      En la internet:      Fundación Estadounidense para la Prevención del Suicidio:  http://www.doctorswithdepression.org       AMA:  http://www.ama-assn.org       Tomado de     http://www.impre.com/noticias/nacionales...

Desde peque?a mis padres y mi entorno en general, se han encargado de darme ciertos valores , pero cada vez es más notable el cambio que está dando la sociedad, en el que juzgan a las personas por su aspecto , en el que preomina un consumismo cada vez mas enfermizo , del que , desgraciadamente , depende nuestra felicidad... (ejemplo claro : la navidad) ?Dónde están ésos valores que se nos inculcan desde peque?os?  Pienso que está marcado, mayoritariamente, por el hechizo de la televisión (así como los medios de comunicación) , que sólo nos da una programación basura , en el que abundan los programas del corazón y la publicidad (la mayoría sólo para anunciar comida basura y en el que cada vez es más notable el machismo en muchos de los anuncios ) y donde muchas veces se ridiculiza nuestra cultura, casi sin que nos demos cuenta...(esto último lo lei en un artículo de un periódico, y es cierto)    ?Y qué me dicen de la anorexia y la bulimia? les suena? A nosotros los jóvenes (tengo 15 a?os) se nos ense?a que la belleza está unicamente en la delgadez extrema... y en tener una "cara bonita" , cuando la realidad es muy diferente... ?Son entonces conceptos como "igualdad" o "belleza interior" simples palabras en el que podamos excusarnos ante la realidad?    Bueno, sólo quería conocer la opinión de otras personas... Siempre es más enrriquecedor conocer otros puntos de vista. Agradezco todas las respuestas... siempre desde el respeto porfavor.

Bueno, les comento, en la facultad, en la materia ceremonial y protocolo, me asignaron un trabajo de investigación. Como me parecio interesante decidi que el tema seria sobre ceremonias orientales.

Asi que, por favor, si conocen alguna pagina o cualkier tipo de fuente de donde pueda sacar informacion, desde ya se los agradezco. Besos

20081007123544AAnYaKl	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Am I justified to bail out at last minute?	At school we have these boring church ceremonies for every special occasion. This year I volunteered to play guitar. So the organizer gave me a tape and so I lelearnedhe song by ear on the day which he gave me the cd.       For the band we needed another guitarist and a drummer so I found some and gave a copy of the cd for them to learn. At general practices with the singers and everyone they never came. Not until 2 days before the concert (a day which I bailed out since I thought they wouldn’t show up again.) Turns out that, that day, the guitarist came but still no drummer (which also happens to live with him). Today the concert being tomorrow the guitarist comes up to me and asks me to teach him the song. He also tells me that the drummer will learn the song tonight (so Im guessing no "full band" practice until tomorrow - the big show).      Point is to me from this point I thought it couldn’t be done so I said no count me out. They wasted my time. They even told me they never even bothered to listen to the tape, still expecting me to show him how to play it which is rediculous, an insult to me - even if we did manage get the song right for tomorrow. It was so badly organized so now the singers and the organizer will be disappointed tomorrow, ending up looking bad. What do I do? Is it my fault.      We still didn't even have a bassist.

En la Epístola I a Timoteo (2.11, en adelante), "San" Pablo escribió: “La mujer aprenda en silencio, con plena sumisión. No consiento que la mujer ense?e ni domine al marido, sino que se mantenga en silencio, pues el primero fue formado Adán, después Eva. Y no fue Adán el seducido, sino Eva, que, seducida, incurrió en la trasgresión. Se salvará por la crianza de los hijos, si permanece en la fe, en la caridad y en la castidad, acompa?ada de la modestia”.     ?No puedo creer que este "Santo" sea tan reverenciado?

This is what I mean, why do some parents either give their kids names that are really long, really weird, or just plain ghetto? Let me use my name as an example, for some reason my parents decided to have me use my middle name "enrique" as my 1st name. Can you imagine how it must've been for the people who have to write my name wondering how do you spell that?      Thankfully my real 1st name is Hector which is much simpler to spell. Or take people with REALLY ghetto names like "laquanisha". she could very well be the most educated and respectful classy person on earth but employers and deans at universities are not going to take her seriously because they will assume stuff about her just because of her name. or take for example guys with the name "d!ck". can you imagine how much they must get clowned at for having that name?      so why do people who come to america give their kids names that are either really long, weird, or that simply just make things harder for their kids? I know some of us wanna be "different" but we also have to be realistic here about what kind of "different" names will do for your children?

La maestra  pidió a sus alumnos que, como tarea,trajesen lo que más despertarse en ellos el sentimiento del amor.   Al día siguiente la maestra les dijo:   -Quiero que cada uno muestre lo que trajo consigo.   El primer alumno respondió: Yo traje esta flor, ?no es linda?   Cuando llegó su turno, el segundo alumno dijo: Yo traje esta mariposa.Vea el colorido de sus alas; la voy a colocar  en mi colección.   El tercer alumno completó: Yo traje este pichón de pajarito que se cayó del nido, ?no es gracioso?   Y así los chicos, uno a uno, fueron colocando lo que habían recogido en el patio.      Terminada la exposición, la maestra notó que una de las ni?as no había traído nada y se sentía avergonzada por eso.   La maestra se dirigió  a ella y le preguntó:    -Muy bien: ?y tú? ?no has encontrado nada?   La criatura, tímidamente, respondió:   -Disculpe, maestra-Ví la flor y sentí su perfume; pensé en arrancarla pero preferí dejarla para que exhalase su aroma por más tiempo.Vi también la mariposa pero parecía  tan feliz que no tuve  el coraje de  aprisionarla.Vi también el pinchoncito caído entre las hojas, pero...al subir al árbol, noté la mirada triste de su madre y preferí devolverlo al nido.   Por lo tanto,  maestra, traigo conmigo el perfume de la flor, la sensación de libertad de la mariposa y la gratitud que observé en los ojos de la madre del pajarito. ?Cómo puedo mostrar lo que traje?   La maestra agradeció a  la alumna y le dio la nota máxima,considerando que había sido la única que logró percibir que sólo podemos traer el amor en el corazón.   Esto nos ense?a que el amor no es tomar, arrancar, capturar o forzar, amar es llevar en el alma, amar es ser libre y dejar libre.      Anónimo.   .........................................

Te amo para amarte y no para ser amado, puesto que nada me place tanto como verte a ti feliz.      George Sand (1804-1876) Escritora francesa.      Amar no es solamente querer, es sobre todo comprender.   Fran?oise Sagan (1935-2004) Escritora francesa.      Ni la ausencia ni el tiempo son nada cuando se ama.   Louis Charles Alfred de Musset (1810-1857) Poeta francés.      Ama y haz lo que quieras. Si callas, callarás con amor; si gritas, gritarás con amor; si corriges, corregirás con amor, si perdonas, perdonarás con amor.   Tácito (55-115) Historiador romano.         El que ha conocido sólo a su mujer y la ha amado, sabe más de mujeres que el que ha conocido mil.   Leon Tolstoi (1828-1910) Escritor ruso.         Aprendemos a amar no cuando encontramos a la persona perfecta, sino cuando llegamos a ver de manera perfecta a una persona imperfecta.   Sam Keen (1931-?) Escritor, profesor y filósofo americano.            La se?al de que no amamos a alguien es que no le damos todo lo mejor que hay en nosotros.   Paul Claudel (1868-1955) Escritor y diplomático francés      .   Amar es encontrar en la felicidad de otro tu propia felicidad.   Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) Filósofo, físico y matemático alemán.      Puede uno amar sin ser feliz; puede uno ser feliz sin amar; pero amar y ser feliz es algo prodigioso.   Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850) Escritor francés.      deseaba compartirlo con vosotros!      feliz fin de semana para todos!

Mi pregunta es:   ?Por que el Gobierno Nacional todavía no ha hecho cumplir la Constitución Nacional Argentina, la cual prohíbe los monopolios?   Me refiero precisamente a los monopolios de las empresas de servicios: electricidad, agua, telefonía, gas..   Este marco de ilegalidad en la que operan dichas empresas fue y es avalada por los todos los gobiernos desde la década de los '90. Mientras tanto, nosotros estamos atrapados por los caprichos empresariales de las mismas.      Para quienes opinan que este es un gobierno "zurdo" o "comunista":   ?Como se explica que permitan el capitalismo extremo que representan estas practicas?   Para quienes defienden este gobierno a toda costa:   ?Como se explica que el mismo mantenga intactas las contrataciones leoninas que llevó adelante el turco corrupto?      La pregunta es clara y coherente, por lo tanto solo acepta respuestas del mismo calibre.   Gracias

Para quien no la vio, trata de un millonario que propone a una chica y su pareja pasar una noche con la chica a cambio de un millón de dolares.   Pues bien, esta pareja se la piensa y deciden aceptar, con los conflictos que la decisión acarrea mas tarde.      En lo personal, si un tipo viene a hacerme una propuesta similar, (pasarse una noche con la mujer que amo a cambio de un millón de dólares), le partiría la boca de una trompada antes de que terminara de hablar.

20090217075148AAYVWsJ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Anoche vi la peli, El Sospechoso, en ingles Rendition o Cia.Vuelos Secretos, y después no pude dormir?	Esta película causa verdadero enojo y rme trastorno el sue?o.      Si bien es ficticia, esta parcialmente basada en el siguiente caso real:   "En Canadá vive Maher Arar, un ingeniero de software totalmente inofensivo, originario de Damasco, quien fue detenido en el aeropuerto JFK, de Nueva York, y pasó por un trato casi idéntico al del ficticio egipcio de la película. Se sospechaba que era miembro de Al Qaeda, y la policía montada canadiense transmitió ese "chisme" sin fundamento al FBI.    Lo trasladaron en un avión de la CIA a Siria, donde se le mantuvo en una cárcel subterránea y fue torturado.    El gobierno canadiense después dio a Arar 10 millones de dólares como compensación y recibió una disculpa pública del primer ministro, Stephen Harper.      Pero los matones de Bush no se inmutaron.    Aún afirman que Arar es “sospechoso de terrorismo”, razón por la cual testificó en una reunión especial del Congreso estadunidense el 18 de octubre, en la cual tuvo que aparecer en una pantalla gigante en Washington.       Si la vieron, me darían su impresión?   Gracias

Entre tanto tira y afloje, pro y contras, odios y amores, estoy buscando el lado positivo a lo que denominamos era Kirshner   Por ejemplo, me consta que el PAMI funciona.   Mi madre recibe todos los medicamentos en forma gratuita (como debería haber sido en la época del turco maldito) incluso unas inyecciones que salen $5000 (unos 1500 dólares) cada una. Conste que ella no pertenece ningún partido político.   Los genocidas de los a?os '70 estan siendo procesados y encarcelados por la justicia tal cuál manda la Constitución Nacional, dejando limpios a los sectores militares que no cometieron delitos.   Se va a terminar con el modelo educativo que instauró el turco maldito para volver a un sistema algo anticuado pero mas funcional.   Bueno... digan lo que quieran.. Pero no insulten, si?

Luego, estas empresas ofrecen como "servicio" la provisión de monedas a tres o cuatro grandes compa?ias, como ser cadenas de hipermercados multinacionales.

If you believe we evolved from a ape like ancestor than there could be a possibility that snakes did talk back than. Remember scripture says that God made it to crawl as a punishment. So why say that you believe in evolution but than you deny the talking snake. Hell if we come from a monkey like creature that couldn't talk, why are we talking now? I think it's funny that a lot of atheist want us to believe we come a ape like creature, but we are in the wrong to say that a snake once talk. If you want proof that snakes once talk, I will get it to you the day you show me visible proof that we come from a ape like ancestor.

20090222164857AAGRuKq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians have you ever seen God?	"Has anyone ever seen God?" In John 1:18 we are told, “No one has ever seen God.” However, in John 6:46 we learn that there’s an exception. Here it says, “No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God.” In 1st John 4:12 it says again, “No one has ever seen God.” The writer of 1st Timothy 1:17 tells us that God is invisible. In Exodus 33:20 God warns Moses, “. . . no one can see my face and live.” Then God proceeds to contradict himself. According to Genesis 16:13 God appeared to Hagar, and she admits to having seen him. In Genesis 26:24 we learn that God appeared to Isaac yet he did not die. In Genesis 32:30 Jacob gets the best of God in an all night wrestling match after which he brags that he saw God face to face and lived. But to compound the confusion, in Exodus 24:9-11 we learn that Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and the seventy elders of Israel not only saw God, they had a banquet with him. Confusing, isn't it?

20090222185214AAcXkMn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the difference between faith and religion?	I have checked my Bible and there are only 3 references to religion and they all deal with works. 2 Timothy 3:5 talks of holding to the form of religion but not it's power. James 1;27 says what religion is in that it is obeying God's word in loving others. Paul talks of the religious in Acts 17:22-31 and what is required for salvation.     Faith on the other hand is completely separate from religion when it comes to salvation. there are over 50 references to faith and none of them have to do with religion in order to be saved. Faith is the hope of things unseen. Religion is what is seen by the world.     If you don't agree try this. Try and find one place where Christ tries to establish a religion or says which one to follow. Next, if you have a good concordance, find the word faith and replace it in the verses with religion and see if it works.

If you cannot then can you see how your beliefs about god and religion stop you from having an open mind?

20090222165515AARaLQQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you're an atheist, from whence do human rights come?	One of the sources of human rights is so-called natural law, that is, people have certain rights because, to quote Thomas Jefferson, "they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights."      If you don't believe in a Supreme Being, where do human rights come from?  Would it be safe to say that in such a scenario human rights are wildly subjective based upon current understanding?      Note that I am not suggesting that you have to be a theist to believe in human rights, but it seems to me that the concept of immutable rights is a little flawed without the acknowledgment of a Supreme Being being the source of it.      Thoughts?        Cheers!

20090222193254AAJXBDt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should I Tell My Parents About What My Stupid Uncle Did?	My uncle is an idiot.       My uncle was a huge druggie from the time he was eighteen till about fifteen years ago. Coke, pot, alcohol etc.      It comes out three years ago that my uncle was in debt 250,000 to credit cards. This makes no sense because he made a hundred thousand dollars a year from our business and lived an apartment owned by my dad who charged him much less than what normal rent should be. He has no family, no wife, no kids etc. He never purchased expensive cars or anything. I have no idea where the money went.      My parents get the credit card company to settle with him for sixty thousand. They loan him sixty thousand to pay this cause he doesn't have any money. He is apparently paying them off.      My dad just sold his piece of property partially owned by my uncle. My dad owns like eighty percent and my uncle twenty percent. My dad basically sold the building because he wanted to get out of the business with my uncle and give him a second chance in life after he lost his money. My uncle got around a half a million. This is his last chance.      My uncle has a stupid friend who owned a business that made money for the last thirty years but in the last five it has been loosing money and he is going out of business. The idiot is putting his own money into the failing business. My parents have always worried that my uncle would loan money to his stupid friend. I just found out that he loaned at least fifty grand to the guy.      I don't think that my parents know. Should I tell them?
20090222180928AAIP7ZT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Magic Spells, are they evil? ******?	Magic Spells, are they evil? ******?   Ok so I am a very spiritual persona and believe in magic. I have used spells three times and have always got what I desired but at a cost. These things came in strange ways and normally with bad consequences. I used one to make a guy I liked come abroad with my family, he did but it ended very badly and nothing like it had ever happened to me before. I wished to be popular and now im hanging around with the most popular people in my area and having a great time but I am unhappy as I am never fufilled. I wished to be beautiful and within the past four months I have become very attractive and my best friends are always telling me how much I changed and now im prettier then most of the best looking people in my school but now im obseesed with my looks and get majorly depressed at the slightest criticism and I feel as if I have become fake and lost my identity. I am starting to think magic is evil. I want to use it again I know I should not but it is so tempting but im scared. Do you believe in magic? Did you ever use magic and what were your results? Do you think magic is evil?

20090222165606AAabRCJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Wiccans regarding Dianic Wicca?	From what I understand, Dianic Wicca is generally pertains exclusively to the goddess, celebrating only female mysteries, and most Dianic Wiccan covens/groups are all-female.       My question is, can a male Wiccan become a Dianic Wiccan? In that because of his gender, he cannot join such a coven or be a Dianic Wiccan in the traditional sense, but because he feels a strong connection to the goddess/divine feminine (and to the Goddess Diana), that he can be more of a solitary Dianic Wiccan?       I'm asking Wiccans and Pagans who are knowledgable about this question, so please no smart mouthed comments or evangelizing. If you don't agree or understand then just politely move on...thanks = )

Even I was once seduced by the beauty of an eternal, meaningful, sweet afterlife. I understand the attraction. Despite having read the Bible several times, I still find the notion attractive (especially since the Bible does not support a doctrine of eternal torment for unrepentant sinners). However, isn't Christianity's beauty bastardized (if not by parts of scripture itself) by the evil, fallacious doctrine of eternal torment?

20090222163418AAMa0R6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Truth Seem Too Narrow?	Does Truth appear to be narrow-minded by man's standard, i.e what he thinks truth should be?      Truth is not everything to everybody. It can't be.      There can only be one truth... when man rejects it then he makes his own, or says yours is good for you and mine is good for me. Welcome to post-modern society.      If you don't like the truth, what man does is make it how he likes it, how he says it should be. Problem is, we don't have control or have authority over it... or over all things.      Jesus said "I am the Truth, the Life and The Way. No one comes to the Father except through Me.'      If we reject that, we reject truth, and follow ourselves, which is a dead-end. People can argue all day, it doesn't change what is greater than us, if you reject truth, you fall into a trap of a man-created falsehood.      Man's nature is to please himself, not sacrifice, not even open his eyes to what gives him life or what harms him, if it doesn't ultimately please him or go along with what he wants.      Our condition, our truth, is narrow. Can't change it. But it brings life.      It is a problem of the heart. We try to find it in other things.      It isn't science.   It isn't Evolution.   It isn't Atheism.   It isn't having things.   It isn't in personal beauty.   It isn't in a social life.   It isn't even in education, ultimately.      None of theses things give us what we need to heal our hearts, and touch our lives with what we need. They aren't answers...       The problem is in our hearts, and letting God, who has what we need, being allowed to heal our hearts. It's no place else.      We cannot do what is greater than what we ourselves are. And that is what we try to do, heal and bring life to ourselves, in so many ways... all of which will fall short.      God is not surprised by anything we do... not by your Atheism, not by your good and bad things.... because we all have corrupted hearts. But they can be healed by the only One who can heal them.         Truth has to be narrow, and in it is life.

20090222180550AArHzgt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think that (some) Protestants are too lenient?	I think that some protestant churches are too out of touch of 'real' christianity. I believe that they're too lenient, they teach things that contradicts the Holy Bible such as: "fornication is permitted if the couple are in a committed relationship and are one day going to marry" and "Jesus is the son of God and not God" and "gays are allowed to have sexual relations as long as they are in a committed relationship" and "euthanasia is allowed if the ill person is in loads of pain" and "divorce is allowed". The newer protestant churches say that sex before marriage is alright because they have to get with "the times" but how can they change what Jesus has taught us and replace them with things "of men". So do you agree or disagree?

20090222193236AAt9bX0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religiously speaking, does it matter if homosexuality is "unnatural"?	I've seen this argument over and over again on here and was wondering what exactly about something being "natural" or "unnatural" is irrevocably linked to its inherent "goodness."      1. Plastics:       Plastics are most certainly unnatural.  They are manmade;  without them, most of  modern medicine/technology would not be possible.  I would view this "unnatural" thing as a positive, and would hope you would agree.      2. Cancer:      Cancer is natural and it kills.  It is a negative.      So, given the fact that your argument is obviously an example of the naturalistic fallacy (appeal to nature), and thus is invalid, can we move on to debunking the next of your "reasons" why homosexuality should be legislated against?

20090222164155AASO34k	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	"Atheists are not Americans."?	Would you be willing to join an organization by way of your signature, that states you are are a member of the Atheist Religion in a Church of Atheism in order to be able to have equal rights as theists?      Note: Rights you do not have include:      1.) Labor laws: They do not protect extra days atheists want off but they do protect religious holidays, protect dress code violations if it's related to their religion, protect time off during work hours for religious prayer.      2.) Marriage: Religious people can have a priest marry them, a judge (or legal equivalent) , or if their religion requires they can marry themselves without a priest or a judge. Atheists can only have a Judge (or legal equivalent).      3.) Military: Atheists and theists are taxed to pay for Military Chaplains. In the military many atheists report anecdotes of being forced to attend "spiritual fitness" classes, religious benedictions, prayers, and other classes such as religious marriage counseling. Unofficially they are harassed, denied advancement in rank due to their not being religious, and many other examples of discrimination are imposed upon them.      4.) Cannot hold political offices. Though the United states constitution prohibits it, many state constitutions do not allow for any Atheist to hold any government office.      5.) Taxes: Religions are allowed tax deductions for their representative institutions and their staff. Atheists have no such tax deductible institutions (yet).      6.) No lobbyists: Religious people are able to protect their rights through representation in the government weather by lobbyists or politicians themselves. Atheists, agnostics, spiritualists, and free thinkers more than triple the amount of Hindu's Buddhists and Jews combined in this country but the Congress has only seen one out of the closet atheist EVER.      And many other more examples. Not all of them would be solved by said membership, but many if not most would be alleviated or eradicated by Atheists establishing Atheism as a Religion and founding a Church of Atheism.      Would you join?

20090222192851AAMsayg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do you find Scientology to be a weird religion?	I find it just as credible as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and the others.

20090222165259AAlgN4p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why should gay marriage be illegal?	You should get a kick out of this.      01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.       02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.       03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.       04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.       05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.       06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.       07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.       08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.       09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.       10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

20090222181942AASwgpz	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How will i know if my best friend's gay and in love with me?	Im a guy and in 3rd year highschool. I have a bestfriend who is just sooooooooo handsome and good looking. we've been best friends since prep level and still friends until now. We are really close and very touchy too. When our eyes meet, we gaze into each other's eyes until someone looks away or asks why. We do everything together and I would even pay for everything when were together just because I want to be with him. I honestly go crazy if i dont get to talk/chat/see him. HE is really good looking and alot of girls are doing extraordinary feats to add him in friendster, chat with him or simply see him but he doenst have a girlfriend. He is kinda emo-ish but on a very small level.Aside from the fact that he is not that talkative but only i can make him talk for long. I really love his laugh. I pretty much make a fool out of myself just to see that beautiful smile and laugh. My other classmates have told me that he sometimes looks at me when im not looking. The look that says i love you. That kind of look. When we watch movies, he would sometimes hold my hand if theres a scary part(this could mean that he is either trying to stop me from covering my eyes or just wants to hold my hand) and leans on my shoulder. Its very sweet. I have this strange feeling when he is beside me and he hold my hand. I pretty much go to some school events that are not mandatory just to see him. He is the type of guy who looks like a girl. emo-hair thin body. He doesn't act like a gay-girlish person who flaunts but he acts like a shy girl. Really looks like a girl. I treat him as one. I really love him and i dont know if he feels the same way for me. Im pretty kinda defiantly maybe sure that he is gay for me. I even think he sometimes begs me to kiss him cause he looks at me when our faces are JUST TOOOO close. I also feel the strong amount of WANT AND NEED to simply press my lips against his.u know guys. there was recently an event that happened in my class. one of my friends who is really gay told they guy he was gay for. That guy said that he wasnt gay and now the whole class knows it and their friendship is now destroyed. i wont let that happened to me.   but i did ask him one night if he loved me as a friend. he said yes. I love him. How do i know if He is gay?

20090222164407AAMdkQS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Any chance he's bi or gay?	Me and my friend have been like brothers for 9 years and we've been really close. The past few times he's been over to my house, if we were watching a movie on my laptop or something and we were sitting next to each other on my couch, he would sit like right up against me and sorta put his head on my shoulder. He also jokes sometimes and acts like he's gonna kiss my cheek but turns away and laughs. And a few times he's hugged me but thats only cause were like best friends. He likes girls and has girlfriends but the way he acts around me is different then my other guy friends. Is there any chance that he could be bi or something? Or do you think that since were such good friends, he feels comfortable acting that way around me?

20090222165503AA9LbEz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Meaning or short Summary of LK 15:11-32 ?	Reading   The Prodigal Son (Luke 15: 11-32 King James Version)   Then Jesus said: "A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.' So he divided to them his livelihood.   And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want.       Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything.But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants." '       And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.'       But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' And they began to be merry.       Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.'But he was angry and would not go in.        Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him. So he answered and said to his father, 'Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends. But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.'       Then the father said to him, "Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.'       What does it mean ?    What kind of picture would i use for this ?
20090222165628AAyNOnS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist where is your faith?	I have had Atheist friends and am quite aware as to generalizations of belief, or lack of belief.  My question is not of faith in God or the lack of God, but faith.        Do you have faith in anything?
20090222172331AAWAslE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist or Anarchist?  Do you know the difference?	How many out there are actually anarchist that are claiming to be atheist.  Atheism is simply the disbelief in a God.  I can understand that for some accepting that their is a God may be more difficult than for others.  The part that is confusing to me still, is how their is a lack of faith.  Most atheist answered that they only have faith in themselves.  This is more of an anarchist view point.

Communion is offered in remembrance of Christ.   2. Jesus did not go to Heaven on the same day that he was crucified.   3. God's authority to judge the world may be delegated to various individuals.   4. The days of creation were probably not 24-hour periods.   5. We existed as spirits before the Earth was created.   6. All people, whether good or evil, will be resurrected.   7. The Bible as we have it today is imperfect, and contains some errors.   8. Those who live in serious sin should not be granted full fellowship until they repent.   9. Premarital sex, extramarital sex, and homosexual sex are all sinful.   10. One must believe in Jesus before receiving baptism.   11. Baptism must be performed by immersion.   12. Miracles, healings, and speaking in tongues still occur today.   13. Salvation in the kingdom of God is dependent on the grace of God.   14. Salvation is also dependent on the works of the individual.   15. The church has deacons, bishops, elders, pastors, and other ministers.   16. Christ is the head of the church.

I really want to because he was an amazing person and i'd love to have him back in my life but he hates gay people. This might not seem like a big thing but I'm bi and i never told him. I already feel bad about it but he said if he ever found out i was bi he wouldn't talk to me ever again.

20090222173458AAPdXEi	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are people so hateful and quick to judge?	As I've matured and got older (22 now) I notice more and more how incredibly condemning people are. It bewilders me. Why do people feel such need to make other people feel bad? Why do they feel the need to be 'right' all the time? Why can't people take responsibility for their own actions and admit that they made a mistake?      Like how people get angry because their in a hurry and there's a traffic jam. It's not the other drivers fault if you are late, it's your OWN fault for not leaving home sooner, for leaving it up to chance.      Or people who constantly point out what others do wrong. Is it really necessary? Really? Will the world go under because your friend pronounces a word wrong? Will heaven fall down upon us if someone has an original way of dressing themselves? Why can you not keep it to yourself?      Why is it wrong to have a romantic relationship with someone you love, if you both want it and are of age? What does it matter? Really? If they're the same sex, if there's a large age difference? Why should it matter to YOU? What does it give you to jump up and down and shout your opinion on the matter? Are you so self-centered and so fixated with your own idea of 'right' that you can't look past yourself and see that there are so many Different opinions of right and wrong in the world that that nobody can ever be neither right nor wrong.       Why can't people just accept what is and let it be?

Of course the song must be a Christian one. Also, the dance is lyrical so the song has to be contemporary or slow. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks.

20090203102054AAQMkxe	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Which one makes more sense?	Salam,      both Shia and sunni agree that prophet Mohammad (PBUH) said:      “Do I not have more right over the believers than what they have over themselves?” People cried and answered: “Yes, O’ Messenger of God.” Then Prophet (PBUH) held up the hand of Ali and said: “Whoever I am his (Mawla), Ali is his (Mawla). O’ God, love those who love him, and be hostile to those who are hostile to him.”      and only to mention a few sources:   (1) Sahih Tirmidhi, v2, p298, v5, p63   (2) Sunan Ibn Maja, v1, pp 12,43   (3) Khasa’is, by al-Nisa’i, pp 4,21   and there are lots and lots more.....         Immediately after Prophet (PBUH&HF) finished his speech, the following verse of Holy Quran was revealed:      “Today I have perfected your religion and completed my bounty upon   you, and I was satisfied that Islam be your religion.” (Quran 5:3)         and to mention only a few sunni sources:   (1) al-Durr al-Manthur, by al-Hafiz Jalaluddin al-Suyuti, v3, p19   (2) Tarikh, by Khatib al-Baghdadi, v8, pp 290,596 from Abu Hurayra   (3) Manaqaib, by Ibn Maghazali, p19   and lots and lots more      so, Shias say the word "Mawla" means "Leader", while sunni translate it as "friend"         so does it make more sense to say the religion of Islam was completed when prophet Mohammad (PBUH) told us who our "friend" is?   or does it make more sense to say Islam was completed when prophet Mohammad (PBUH) told us who our "leader" is after his death?                              your honest opinion please...........      Peace.

20090222194944AAGS9rj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would endangerment to the mother's life be the ONLY acceptable reason for abortion?	I am listening to a 12-year-old give a speech about abortion as I am typing this now, and I am just moved by her passion.  According the the speech, about 1% of abortion cases of hard-case categories, including the life of the mother being in danger.  Here is the link:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOR1wUqvJ...       I am not in favor of abortion being used as a birth control method, and I think rape and incest cases should seriously consider giving it up for adoption if they cannot handle raising a child.  However, if it's shown by medical professionals early on in the pregnancy that having the baby can kill you (yes, despite technology and medicines, it can still happen), then I think this should be the only acceptable reason to abort the fetus.      Just imagine that your mother had died giving birth to you, and your father is so upset and outraged by the fact that you took his beloved wife away.  As outdated and cliche as it may sound, he just might turn to the bottle, and not go 24 hours without beating you up and tearing your spirit down, until you are convinced that you killed your mother, and may suffer self-esteem issues because of it.  Your father may even want to put you in an orphanage or drop you off at a random home because he doesn't want to raise you.  Imagine being ostracized and unloved by your mother's side of the family because you took their daughter and sister away.  How would you feel in all this?      I remember overhearing my father tell a friend some years ago that if he were in this situation, he would choose his wife over the unborn baby, because he wouldn't know what to do if that were to happen to him.      This question is open to both pro-lifers and pro-choicers.  Try not to be so preachy, but be as honest as you can.  Thank you.

It honestly seems like the most ridiculous attempt to salvage your "straightness" if you ask me.  I don't think people go through any "phase" of homosexuality, but then again, I've never known anyone to do it and I don't know enough people to know the truth.  I think people might say that to convince the people around them that their homosexual desires are now "gone" and now they're "normal" again if they were rejected at first.
20090203101437AAY2nuf	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Making up lies to promote shia' religion, or whats known as taqeyah, how dangerous is this practice?	they say that taqeyah is obligatory    sources:      "Mix with them(i.e. non-shia) externally but oppose them internally." (Al-Kafi vol.9 p.116) now this Shi'ite hadeeth means that they should mix with us and try to decieve us..It trully shows us Muslims what the Shi'ites are!       "He who conceals his religion has saved it, and he who makes it public has destroyed it." now this contradicts the Quran as will be shown below.       "A believer who does not dissimulate is like a body without a head." (Tafseer al-Askari) It is also interesting that the Shi'ites article of Faith "Taqayyah" is just like what the Talmudites (jews who follow the Talmud) say about the Goyyims (non-jews,) as all Talmudites say that they should lie to us non-jews..You see this explains a lot about the Shi'ites and their Similarities with the Jews as the Shi'ite sect was started by Abdullah bin Saba'. (a Jew who started the shi'ite religion, just with the intent of trying to destroy the Muslims..this in explained in the article "Who founded the Shi'ite Religion")       "Nine tenths of religion is taqiyyah (dissimulation), hence one who does not dissimulate has no religion." (Al-Kafi vol.9 p.110) This shows us that Shi'ites have to lie to us as if they don't then they will not be called Muslims by other Shi'ites....it shows us how sick is the Shi'ite faith.

My family never believed in god or such, but only to live as a good person and have nothing but love for everyone.        Sometimes, American Jews would be confused at how I could be atheist and Jew at same time.  Many also thought it was unusual that I didn't think I was a "Chosen One" and that every person was the same to me.  I thought of myself as a Russian boy with an indicated nationality more than anything.  What was your experience with American or Western Jewish culture when you came over?
