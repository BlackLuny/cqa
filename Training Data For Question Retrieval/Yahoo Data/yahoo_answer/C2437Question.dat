20090220072903AAGxO7y	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A Dorsimbra for the anxious soul....?	I'll Not Doubt Morn Again      The density of fog has left my eyes   On somber moonlit dock I fawn the night   The harbor steals its beauty from the sky   Reflecting starlight’s gift to sailor’s sight.      The golden hands of God   Wait silently for dusk   as the gentle sun bids morning’s   binding slate.      The harrowed moment passes ‘neath the waves    I muffle absent thoughts and stand in awe   An angel sentry leaps horizon’s edge   The density of fog has left my eyes.

Shame      For pride’s sake do I hide my naked body from your view,   I can build no tower for your pleasure   for those machines were taken from me   and now, in darkness even   I am ashamed.      My love, my angel you are my strength,   you could never disappoint me,   just kiss my eyes and face each night   and know, you are the man I choose.      I kissed her eyes, I kissed her face   and she slipped to slumber.   I lay there in the silence then   moistening a pillow with n’er a whimper   and I knew that strength had failed.      When she awoke that morning, it was   to a light-flood through the bedroom window,   the warmth of the sun was succulent and sensual   and she lingered, eyes closed, in its magnificence.   Her hand grazed her stomach as it drifted towards her mate,   she shivered slightly at the touch,   then a lost-ship feeling replaced the hint of ecstasy    and panic erupted to paper-crunch on pillow   reporting yet more unfathomable loss.

It seems like the natural is whiter and more "natural", while the studio (basic studio lighting) is warmer and has more "dimension" (I can't think of  the right word) because of the soft shadows it creates instead of the picture possibly looking "flat?"

Rape is a traumatic thing and it would be hard enough to go through it, but to hear someone else relive it in their mind and cry about it and think 'could he (that random stranger on the street) do that to me too?' especially after it first happened, I know Rosalie was depressed and I know it was always on her mind.

Do you think he tried to comfort her or talk to her?

I saw the Polish film "Katyn", which reveals the mass murder of more than 10 thousand Polish military officers by the NKVD at the Katyn forest in the suburbs of Smolensk, Russia in the spring of 1940.   According to history and the film as well, the Soviets claimed that it was committed by the German Gestapo, and they used it as an anti-Nazi campaign.   Of course, Goebbels also tried to use it as an anti-Bolshevistic propaganda in the German-occupied countries.      Could you tell me how the Germans managed to prove the massacre was committed by the NKVD, not by the Gestapo?

Undervalued   People call you smelly    Shouting hate out loud   You think you’re unworthy    Feeling really down.   This is such a fool’s world;    Makes you feel so sad.   Love is just a cruel word;     Makes you feel so bad.      People call you filthy   Spitting on the ground   Your pain is like a trophy   Making them feel proud.   Tears go on the record   Laughter’s understood   Cuts you like a cord   Makes them feel so good.      You know it isn’t healthy   As you look around   Wishing you’re ignored,   Or hidden underground.   ‘Please somebody save me,’   A prayer to anyone   It’s been much worse lately   This feeling; ’ you’re no one.’      Now you’re getting desperate   You promise by; ‘your word’   You won’t be separate    Your fears are observed.   ‘I’ll even spill my blood’   You shout out to impress   A promise you make good   In the quiet of darkness.      Now they’ll understand   Or so you think they should   But it didn’t go as planned    And you lost too much blood.   Looking down upon them   As they mourn for your loss   Who is most to blame   For this love we’ve all lost?   Edgar Noe   20/2/09
20090220081423AAN3zx4	Arts & Humanities;History	Why did Japan Attack Pearl Harbour?	I'm researching about world war 2 for my School Project and i have to say im a little confused. What I know so far is that, at the end of the 1800's Japan was very modernized and started war with nearly all of her neighbors. This continued to the start of world war 2 and then she made a treaty with germany that basically said that Germany would take over Europe and Japan would have Asia.      The U.S.A. was worried about this the whole time and was sending army supplies to most of the countries that were being invaded, even though Germany said "This would be considered an act of War!".       I know that Japan fealt threatened by the U.S. Islands in the Pacific and was annoyed with the U.S. giving supplies to China (as they were trying to take over China), but I still dont understand why they attacked pearl Harbour.      We were a superpower and they were trying to take over Asia. The last thing they neaded was for the U.S. to get involved. Even Yamamoto said "Do not wake the giant".

20090220092844AA71i9F	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A poem from last year, One of my whimsical ones, please critique?	Damselfly Down.      I here in the sunshine feel warm and alive   My wings with the breeze they want to take flight   I know my days numbered will pass in a flash   My dried up remains a thing of the past      On a tenuous wind I am lifted and soar   A bird swoops above me so I fly lower   Intent on escape killers from sky   I slam into the web of the spider      The more I struggle more wedged I become   Immovable trapped - stuck fast   The spider looks so menacing, hungry   I know for certain my time has now come      He looks at me menacing, staring with greed    His 8 legs waltz stealthily toward me    My eyes filled with terror my end in sight   I closed them now. I closed them TIGHT      As my tensions grew taught, my breath came slow   I felt a hard and lethal blow I dangled by a thread   My eyes flew open and I saw the spider painted red   A paint ball pellet hit him square on the head      The Web now torn and broken down   I felt my body lifted in a small and gentle hand   Two big blue eyes looked down at me   From the kind face of a tiny man      He gently wiped my wings clean   Held me out, arms length - told me to fly   I moved my wings timorously, slowly   Apprehensive, yet feeling indebted      I circled him briefly touched his cheek with a kiss   Before bravely and joyfully, flying away   I’d live to see the wondrous day.   While below me that man child played.

20090220083329AAmwd6n	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How exactly is someone trained to read?	I've seen this brought up on more than one occasion and I'm curious as to how someone is trained to read.       By trained does that mean you know how to read books above a certain level? Do you know how to break it down and analyze it? Or do you just simply pick up a book and read it for enjoyment? Perhaps a combination of the three.       My dislike of English majors in college kept me far away from the English department and into the cave that was the newsroom. My fellow Journalism majors were far more relaxed and less snooty about books. As such, I don't get the idea of being "trained" to read a book. Hell, the last English class I took was about four years ago. I read plenty of books in college and had to think critically on many of them but I don't recall being "trained" per se.      Can someone explain this to me?
20090220082339AAOg34l	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why does society obsess over relationships?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?

20090220102509AAHufM3	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poetry: what do you think of my poem?	Under the iron sea,    a whale has swallowed me.    But in the darkness there,    i didnt really care.    I jumped across the ocean,    with my heart just open.    For whatever i will meet,    for whatever i will see.    I was just prepared,    to do what no one dared.    My mind it was so scared,    my heart was not afraid.    From all what i've seen,    it was safer in the deep black sea.    So what you're gonna say for someone dead like me.    I've wondered laying on my bed,    i turned my thoughts to shreds.    What will i be?     If i always fed the beast.    It will only grow,    to something no one knows.    So i got up and said "thats just cause".    So big white whale,    why have you chosen me?    I will do you no good,    cuz no one ever could.    My own worst enemy,    is all whats beneath me.    He gave my soul to you.    To see what you will do.    A surrendering soul,    thats me there's no more.    Its not really that bad.    Im actually very glad.    For 2 lonely souls to meet.    Under the iron sea.   Lets set the world on pause   and correct all our faults   and then wait and see  what will we be   just you and me

20090220100225AARK1gc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone else do this?	Does anyone else put off reading the last book in a really good series because they're afraid of the closure?      For example, I've been rereading the Harry Potter series, and I finished Half-Blood Prince in December. Since then, I've read about five other books, and both Deathly Hallows and Beedle the Bard are sitting on my bedside table at the bottom of a stack of books.       And I finished The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman (it was amazing beyond belief) in January and have made no move to get The Amber Spyglass out of the library.      I sometimes do this with authors in general. I've only read two of Jane Austen's works (Emma and an abridged version of Pride and Prejudice- the library didn't have an unabridged version). And I have Mansfield Park sitting on my dresser, second to last in another stack of books. She's fantastic, but I don't want to sit there and finish the last of her books. It's not like she'll write another. It's the same with Gregory Maguire, except he'll probably write a few more books, since he's kind of alive right now.      So does anyone do this, or am I just crazy? Because I sound crazy to me.
