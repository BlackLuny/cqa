20090128094724AAd4njf	Dining Out;United States;New York City	Any cool restaurants for teens in NYC?	In March I'm turning 14, and I'm planning on having a Girl's Night Out party in NYC with about 13-15 of my friends. We are planning on taking the train there (with my mother of course) and once we get there we would go to a nice restaurant. Due to the recession, I need a cool restaurant that my friends would like that have dinners from around $13 to $14 each. And hopefully near Grand Central please? If anything, a subway stop away. Your help would be very much appreciated :D      BTW I considered Butter; but then I looked at the menu and it had extremely expensive crap food (in my opinion). Something like the Butter's Birch Room would be nice.      Please and thank you!

20090128101352AAgc4Dy	Dining Out;United States;Other - US Dining Out	Looking for a certain restaurant?	I can't remember where this place is.  I've seen it on tv but I don't remember it's location.  It's a restaurant with water running down the middle like a little spring or something.  I think they built it around this small waterfall and they say it's haunted.  It was built a long time ago.  I can't for the life of me figure out where it is located.  Is it in Northern CA?  I'm heading up there in the next few months and I would love to visit the restaurant if it's there.       Thanks so much in advance!!
