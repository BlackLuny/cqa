Now they have been bailed out by the British public, courtesy of the Labour government.      Can anyone explain in layman's terms, where all the millions of previous years' profits have gone?  It surely cannot all have gone to shareholders, bonuses and bad investments.  But if it has, surely this is bad management and if so why are the British taxpayers being called upon to remedy the situation?  I can't believe all their profits have just vanished into thin air, never to be used again when needed.

Then it said the only thing I need to do is find my state signature form and enter in my DNC (Declaration Control Number) then mail it in.       It says the form was included in the paperwork that I printed. So I'm going through all of that now, but I'm not finding a form that says State Signature Form. Would it be labeled as something else? Also, I looked over all of the pages just to see if I would find a space for a DCN but I'm not finding it.      I actually think its the form titled.

It is on a relatively large lake that also leads into 3 other large lakes, deck, pool, new roof, fireplace.  My problem is that there have been no other houses that have sold on any of these lakefronts in the last few months.  The appraiser said she had to go by near waterfront homes to do the comps.  However, the homes she used were on large ponds, not a lake.  Difference:  You can boat, jet ski, waterski etc. on my lake.  The waterfront she used for the comps only allows canoes.  She also used a fixer upper foreclosure at that!  Plus, none of the other homes she used had pools or a fireplace.  How do I get an accurate appraisal without any generally similar comps?

20090202091341AAJXDhd	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Wash Sale rule on brief trades?	I get the basic concept of the wash sale rule but I am getting tripped up by the fact that it includes shares purchased within 30 days before the sale.   This seems to imply that the wash sale rule applies to quick trades.      Specifically - If I buy 100 shares on Day #1 and sell all 100 shares on Day #20 for a loss I'm thinking that I should be able to claim that loss without the wash sale rule.  But the wording of the rule seems to indicate that I can not claim the loss because the purchase was less than 30 days prior.        In this example - there is one buy and one sell.  I did not repurchase the shares again after the sale.  I understand how the wash sale would effect re-purchased shares.

Yes, it's same-sex marriage.      Aaanyway, my husband already made the will & stated that I will be the sole beneficiary of his properties.      BUT.      I do not have a US Visa. And yes, I have tried millions, well, 5 times (but it felt like a million times already!) & the US Embassy still hasn't granted me yet.      I have my own properties, own business & decent amount of cash in banks which showed in every interview at the US Embassy but still, they haven't granted me a visa.      Why?      Their reason is that I have sisters in the US & 2 of which are citizens already.      Now, our problem is, how will I be able to claim the inheritance (ex. house, valuables etc.) if the US won't even grant me a visa?

China's new 160,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Hainan refinery plans to start up at the end of June, about one month behind schedule, and received its first crude early this week, a company official said on Thursday.        The new plant, whose capacity makes up nearly 3 percent of the country's total, would boost fuel supplies to the key southern Chinese consumers and ease a potential shortage as China heads into peak summer season.       "Deliveries of some of the refining units took longer than expected," said the official from southern Hainan province.       Its first crude, a 2-million-barrel Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) of Girassol from west Africa's Angola, arrived on Monday at Yangpu port of Hainan province, off the southern tip of China.        http://www.zoomchina.com.cn/index.php?/c...

20090202092902AAkBrnC	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Why is the IRS saying I got 1500 for the 2008 stimulus check when I really only got 600?	It is not only delaying my federal income return but according to the Recovery Rebate Credit I am suppose to be able to claim the amount I didn't receive however the IRS is stating on their end I received the full amount and now they have to track the deposit down to either show their error or mine      I know for a fact I only received 600 and not the 1500 they are saying I did, I thought the full amount was only 1200 anyways for married couples and half the amount if you didn't have enough federal income withheld which I did not as I am military and only base pay is taxed.
20090202095158AAgtLI1	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Anyone else having a problem with the IRS stating they got a bigger Stimulus check then they did recieve?

20090202094401AAhVCpa	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	How much should I be getting back?	I attempted to file my state tax return on a free website, and I am confused because it says I should only be getting a return of $99.      I am 22 years old, but I was 21 on December 31st, 2008. I had two different part time jobs in 2008.       Job 1:      Total Wages 6343.54   Federal income tax withheld: 388.05   State income Tax Withheld: 95.00      Job 2:      Total Wages: 3,629   Federal Tax withheld: 164   Social Security tax withheld: 225.00   Medicare Tax withheld: 52.62   State Income tax: 34.00      I worked both of these same jobs last year and got almost all of my federal returns back. I was thinking my return would be in the $400ish range, why are the websites saying it is so low?       I am a full time college student, and my dad claims me as a dependent. This hasn't changed from last year. Could somebody explain it to me?
