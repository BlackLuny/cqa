20090203132841AAR8ZiT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Does anyone else have a 3-month old that won't entertain themselves?	My little one will be 3-months old tomorrow and I'm concerned that she still doesn't seem to be able to entertain herself for more than 15 minutes. I read a lot of the moms on this site talking about how they can lay their 2-month old babies down on an activity mat for up to an hour and they'll entertain themselves so I'm wondering if I just have a "high needs" baby or what? As it is, while she seems to be making great strides with milestones, she still isn't really reaching out to grasp at toys or anything (she'll grasp if I wrap her fingers around something and then she holds it)...she's barely batting at them at this point so when I put her on her activity mat, she just stares up (with a smile, at least) at the toys dangling above her. She just keeps her hands in her mouth and lays there until she gets frustrated and wants me to pick her up again.       I find myself constantly making the rounds all day long through time on the activity mat, time in the bouncy seat (which she seemingly hates), time in the swing, time with mommy reading and mommy dangling toys in front of her, time in the sling carrier, tummy time, etc....but NONE are able to keep her content for more than 15 minutes or so.       High needs baby? (I got this term from Dr. Sears)      Thanks for your feedback.

20090203134011AA2ef6C	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	So frustrated!!!!!!!  =(?	Well, everyone that does know me on here knows my husband and I have been trying for a baby.   We can't try for awhile now.   We are financially in a rut.  I'm not sure why our luck is so pathetic RIGHT NOW.      We are having to pay for things that we shouldn't be having to pay for to begin with like huge gas bills because our landlord thinks we are lieing about the gas.  The pipes have been having problems and just loads of different this and thats.   So, we can't try for another baby until the summer time.  I'm so sad.  =(   I truly am.  Because I am getting closer to ovulating again and can't even try. . .  don't worry I'll still answer questions on here.  I'm not going anywhere in that arena.  Love you guys!

Someone tried to strangle me as a joke but I didn't see that as something funny since living without oxygen isn't too fun.  Today the girls who harass me saw me in the halls and they are like "hey.."  I started walking really fast.  They mentioned some stuff about me winning the spelling bee and how they would love to see an overachiever die.  I started like running!  I was so scared and I don't want to tell my mom since she would be worried and she has enough to worry about (she has heart conditions) and I don't want to burden her.        What do I do???

20090203133715AAWDazy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is he going to stay in there until Saturday? Opinions?	Jan 26 I was 0 cm, 0% effaced, baby was at station 0. (Lol 000 just noticed that!)      Friday I was freaking miserable, my chiropractor could tell I was starting to separate in my hips and I knew baby was even lower.      Over the weekend I had tons of BH and contractions, could barely walk because baby's head was lower and I couldn't really sleep.      Monday, I went in because he wasn't moving as much over the weekend plus the pains and everything. I was 2 almost 3 cm, 80% effaced, baby was even lower (forgot to ask station), and having a few irregular contractions.      Today, she didn't check me to keep from stirring things up and starting labor. I'm not supposed to do a lot of walking or anything to keep from encouraging labor (I'm only 36w 3d today). I go back Thursday and may be checked again. I only had 2 true contractions while there this morning.      Is it likely for him to stay to Saturday (37 weeks) in your opinion? I'm ready to meet him but am worried he may have problems (the whole pregnancy has been problem after problem).

I understand it is safe, but if it did somehow secrete into my breastmilk, how would it affect the baby?

20090203133026AAfcIBB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When did your babies start talking, crawling and eating baby food?	My daughter is almost seven months and I do have a few concerns.  She will not crawl.  She hates being on her stomach for even a couple minutes.  Her legs just start kicking around and either she rolls over on her own or she screams until I pick her up.  I never really gave her much "tummy time" to begin with.  My doctor told me he was not really crazy about the idea at a young age because of sids.  He said if the baby starts to get comfortable on her stomach she will want to start sleeping like that etc.  I think because I never gave her that time,now she hates it.  I even feel like the back of her head is sort of flat, my husband says I am crazy and if the DR never said anything about the growth of her head not to worry but she is even lacking hair growth back there.  She has a ton of hair on the top of her head like none in the back.   In the past couple of days she started talkikng more..she repeats la la la...Da da da..and ba ba ba..and gurgles quiete often lol.     She is not really into the baby food at all...so I dont knw what is up with that.  Any mothers experience similiar concerns?
20090203133330AAYhSNp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How common is this for a baby shower? ?	So my neighbor is throwing a baby shower for her niece. Great idea, right? Babies are great. She's planning this with one of her friends. The niece is giving input on how she wants the shower to be.      The mom to be is not finding out the sex of the baby. That's great too.       The problem is:    They actually put on the card to bring items in both blue and pink since the mommy to be is not finding out the sex of the baby.       They are also considering putting out a jar to gather money for the baby's savings account! They think it'll be cute to put a little sticker on front that says "Baby send me to college!"      I've never heard of such things and I am thinking of not going (yes I am invited!). I have a great relationship with my neighbor and wonder if I don't go, if that would be impolite

I also have two little ones in a duo stroller. And going into the animal buildings were double doors. Every time, someone would turn around and help. Teenagers, moms, dads, and young adults. Just wanted to say thank you for all the help you give us moms. Teenagers to many times get a bad rap. Thank you for the times you say hi to my children. Thank you helping by opening doors. Thank you for helping babysit when I need it. I may not know you personally. But I see you every day. Have a good day.

My question is, she would fly from PHL to Bangkok and have to take a plane to Phuket, which is only an hour but thats not what worries me. Do you think its safe? I feel like if the plane is delayed, than she'll miss her fly to phuket and she'll be in Bangkok all by herself, I mean its a long flight. Would you allow your teenager to do this? She'd be in Bangkok all by herself and than have to fly to Phuket...i just dont know.Shes not nervous, shes flown before but I'm not sure if it sounds like a good idea.

20090425185533AA2GS9p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Heat Rash? Allergic reaction? Something else?	We took a trip to the zoo today, as it was the first super warm day we've had in NE Ohio so far (mid-80's). Before leaving for the hour-long drive, we slathered everyone - including our 14-month-old daughter - in sunscreen. Upon our arrival at the zoo, we noticed that she had developed a rash. It seemed to be mostly on her shins, the backs of her hands and her shoulders. It did not appear on the backs of her legs, her trunk/torso/back, or her face. The bumps were small and red and very slightly raised. It *looked* like a heat rash, but I wasn't sure. We had her in cool, light colored clothing and blasted the AC in the car on the way there, and otherwise made every effort to insure her comfort. The sunscreen we put on her is one approved for babies six months of age and older, and she has worn it many times in the past with no issues. Based on the pictures below, does it look like a heat rash? Could she be having a sudden allergic reaction to the sunscreen? Does it look like something else entirely? I did notice that whenever we went somewhere cooler, it seemed to dissipate somewhat. Regardless, it is not bothering her in the least - she isn't itchy, doesn't seem uncomfortable, and is acting completely normal. We will be calling the pediatrician Monday, even if the rash is gone by then.       http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e94/ba...        http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e94/ba...        http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e94/ba...

20081230184332AA1U4XI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	La maternidad ha sido bien dificil para mi pero no quiero quedarme con un solo hijo, que me recomiendan?	Hola amigos, soy madre de un hermoso bebé de 15 meses y aunque lo adoro con todas las fuerzas y no imagino la vida sin el, debo admitir que hay cosas que no he podido superar: sufrí de depresión post parto a raiz de las pocas horas de sue?o durante los 4 primeros meses y debo decir que el dormir es algo sagrado para mi, es de las cosas que mas aprecio y eso fue lo mas duro, mi ni?o despertaba cada dos horas, yo no tuve ayuda asi que durante el dia no dormia sino que hacia oficios en la casa (se que es un error pero no puedo vivir en el desorden). Mi hijo sufrió de colicos y gases lo que hacia dificil el complacerlo, ni aun en mis brazos el se contentaba por lo que llegué a pensar que no me queria y eso me sumia mas en depresión, fue un tiempo bien pero bien dificil y aun lo es porque yo no soy la persona mas paciente de este mundo. Ahora tengo este dilema que me está matando porque no quiero quedarme con un solo hijo y porque mi ni?o siento que necesita un compa?erito de juegos, me siento mala madre porque estoy poniendo por encima mis problemas a las necesidades de mi hijo y al deseo de todos, incluso el mio de tener otro bebé; por otro lado tengo que tomar esta decisión a corto plazo ya que mi esposo tiene 44 a?os y el no quiere tener hijos despues de los 45.

Would you see your first parents' adopted children as your siblings?      On another forum I belong to, there are 2 first moms who are also adoptive moms (1 in reunion). The one in reunion said her daughter was just fine with the fact she adopted and sees her first mom's adopted daughter (China) as her little sister. But I could only imagine that for an adoptee it would be sad and maybe even confusing, but obviously I do not know.      Are there any first moms here who also adopted or who are thinking of adopting? How do you think your biological children would feel? If reunited; have you spoken to them about it?

20090203102058AAeaTCe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My daughter is just about to turn 14 mos & and is not speaking. ?	She says bye, and is only in the past couple days saying it without it being said to her first. I was reading some other posts and it seems like this is not such a bad thing as long as you child can understand and follow through basic commands. Mine does not. She doesn't go and get the ball she can't point to body parts when i ask her "wheres you arm?"  If she sees milk or juice she cries, and if i take her sippy cup away (to put more milk in it) she cries and follows me to the kitchen, but thats the extent of it. I really feel like she's falling behind. Also, she was saying mama, dadadada, and ohno!, and stop. Thats how she comunicated EVERYTHING. everything was dada, not just  her dad. She would say ohno to anything that displeased her (now she just cries) and "op" (stop) was also used for everything. But even those words are next to never used anymore. I am concerned that shes not cognitively developing properly. She has an appt next month with her dr, but i'd like some opinions now if at all possible.

Later that day I got 4 sharp pains in my right side. I also felt nauseated and felt like my face was very warm, but the rest of my body had chills. I appreciate all of the answers. My hubby and I are ttc # 2 for 2 years and after a miscarriage.      We had sex on the 12th, 14th, 16th(but didn't finish), 20th.

20090222194911AAZkQgN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is it foolish and neglectful to leave month old twins at the office with coworkers so you can go to the salon?	This woman in my office was on maternity leave after having premature twins.  She dropped by the office after the twins' doctors appointment and decided to suddenly leave them with us to run an errand....to get her eyebrows arched.   She said she would be right back in about 20 minutes and she did.   These babies appear healthy but because they were premature, they have to be on electronic breathing monitors for a few months.    This woman is married, has a mother, a mother-in-law and has 3 sisters living in town with her who could have easily watched her babies if she asked them.          Another detail about this situation is that this happened in the SOUTH...in Arkansas and  this woman is black and except for one person all of the coworkers are middle aged  or older whites... some are MEN.        My question is did this woman practice good judgment?  Or does this woman's actions seem NEGLECTFUL AND FOOLISH?

My breasts have been crazy sore (which is the first time that's ever happened), I've been really tired, nauseated and heartburn like nobody's business.  I have PCOS, and this is the first time I've ovualted in a little over 2 years.  Could this just be AF coming on or could I be pregnant??
