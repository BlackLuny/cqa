E a chi dovremmo dare la responsabilità visto che noi non abbiamo il potere di cambiare le cose? Finora questo Governo si è interessato di tutte altre cose rispetto alle emergenze della crisi che abbiamo davanti. Quando provvederà? Non si sa. Ammetto che la crisi è difficile e complessa e non riguarda soltanto l' Italia: ergo, non dipende dai governanti se siano rossi, bianchi o gialli, ma dalla volontà che dimostrano. E questi fino ad ora hanno pensato a salvare le banche, ma non hanno pensato ai prezzi che sono aumentati in modo sproporzionato e spropositato, alle difficoltà di tutta quella schiera di gente che vive con 700-800 euro mensili e che non riesce a finire il mese, ai poveri - veramente tali - che ancora esistono e sopravvivono. Credo che saranno duri i prossimi anni a meno che non si intervenga con qualche sussidio o contributo a chi ha più bisogno. Per le grandi manovre economiche, mi trovi sprovveduto perché non sono un economista e per essere aggiornato leggo i giornali. Ma mi sembra che per risparmiare, non bisognerebbe toccare quelle istituzioni che hanno già il piatto che piange, ma incominciare dai nostri parlamentari e chiedersi: è giusto che abbiano indennità da capogiro? E' giusto che bisogna andare avanti con due camere: deputati e senatori? E' giusto che questi signori abbiamo bende e prebende? E poi, gira e rigira, sono sempre gli stessi che stanno al Parlamento, questi hanno piantato le radici e continueranno ad esserci anche domani. Colpa nostra se li votiamo? No, perché siamo costretti a votarli dato che i candidati ci sono imposti dalle segreterie dei partiti.

Gold lost its glaring as an investment . After the banking system introduced the paper money gold became a 'psychological' store value in times of economical depression, but as metal only in a few manufacturing  and jewelry applications is used.|`|DMNhahNjaa	Hi James,<br>  <br>  Well firstly, our money was used to be backed by GOLD.  Remember, gold used to be our "currency" or money in the past.  Therefore, it is like a "stored value".  <br>  <br>  And I have to say $150 increase is terrible because if we put inflation into consideration and compare it to the real value in 1970s it is a big huge difference.  This shows that the US currency has lost much of its value.<br>  <br>  Investors generally buy gold for two main reasons: to financially gain from increasing gold prices, and/or as a hedge or safe haven against any economic, political, social or currency-based crises.  Because no matter what, gold can be traded for cash again.  Of course, if they really do right now, it's obvious that they are making a lost instead.|`|NmshFbxhaa	GOLD is tangible <br>  you can hold it feel it so the worth is always there<br>  <br>  however i have seen gold lose value also <br>  it is said buy gold when you think inflation will rise<br>  <br>  frankly i think 950 an ounce is 50% over real value<br>  <br>  but if the world collapses people will always take gold over currency|`|yr9yfqjeaa	Gold is a poor investment strategy.

Once that is over, some further investors will move to security of gold. Well, gold may be a great investment at 800/ounce and a foolish investment at 1100. But this is entirely a speculation about what other investors, and particularly large holders of gold, will do.<br>  <br>  Gold certificates are less safe than a government insured deposit. The issuer of the certificate may be unable to return your gold on request, or ever.<br>  Owning bullion or coin can put you at risk if your bank vault is cracked, or your mattress is flipped.<br>  <br>  Gold has not been a stellar performer over the years. There have been times when big money has been made followed by long periods when the results have been negative. Gold does not pay interest or dividends. <br>  <br>  While there is a rush to gold in progress, it can be very tempting.  But gold is ot a buy and hold investment. It is pure speculation. Buy only when it is way down and starting a climb. Sell well before the target price that sellers are talking about.|`|AA10259042	Gold is not actually an investment as such.  It is more or less a hedge. A hedge against the possibility of a currency becoming worthless.  As the possibility of that happening, the price of gold rises to compensate.  And of course as the currency does become more worthless, the value of gold in that currency does increase.

KSFg5rkaaa	Resolve to pay all your bills on time firstly. Next, invest $500 in a reputable credit repair company but do your research. A legitimate credit repair business WITH a track record can save you alot of frustration and wasting of your own time. I did this and was able to raise my score 100 points within a few months. Everything the credit repair people do you can do for free. BUT, they already know techniques, who to mail to etc to get you results. My opinion based on my experience is it works....but if you pay late after hiring the credit repair people they will not do you any good. Bad items fall off after 7 yrs, Bankruptcy 10 years. Sometimes though inaccuracies appear on your report and bad items do not fall off..this is when a good CR company can really help you and offer good advice. And if you are worried about $500 don't, you will get it back in lower interest rates, lower insurance rates etc. Maybe you didn't know that even your car insurance company checks your credit rating before determining how much they will charge you. Not to mention future employers...you may just miss a good job because the person you are competing with has perfect credit.

That should take priority now.  After you are finally out of debt you can start working on your credit score, what you should do is take your oldest credit card (or the one you use the most) and start putting small payments on it each month.  ONLY PAYMENTS YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY OFF IMMEDIATLEY! Next up talk to the credit card company and see if they can raise your credit limit.  Your credit score is based off of whether or not you pay your balance each month and the difference between your monthy balance and your total credit limit.  So stop spending money you dont have, get out of debt, and put very small purchases on your credit cards each month. Thats the only way you can really fix this.

At the time you took out your fixed rate you could get a variable tracker rate BELOW bank base - that was the time to take out a variable rate. Tracker rates are now base plus 3% and more.

What you will have to work out is how much you will save, even with paying the fee because you will also get some other charges in changing your mortgage.  Obviously, if you are going to make a significant saving by changing, do it.  However, bear in mind that mortgage companies have now clamped down on who they lend to and you need to make enquiries as to whether you will get another mortgage if it is with another company and not with your present lender.|`|3f6151909dc1260f5d97f2e15a0ef910aa	The rate isnt always going to be low, now is quite a good time for taking out fixed rate if you can get one on a good deal.<br>  <br>  Going variable now has the risk of it going up, depends on what your current fixed rate is now and what are the chances of a variable rate going above that|`|AA12183016	It could well be a good move as long as the early settlement charge is not greater than the savings you would make.<br>  Just bear in mind that online may not have the newest deals the banks and building societies are offering so visiting them is a much better option. <br>  There are lots of good tracker mortgages out there.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Stay away from anything with the word variable.<br>  Interest rates WILL go up, and could go up sharply.<br>  There is no doubt that invflation is going to hit hard in about 5 years causing that variable interest rate to shoot up.<br>  <br>  You may be saving money now, but in the future you could find yourself in a mess.<br>  <br>  Please stay with 30 or 15 year fixed.<br>  /

The acquisition may continue to operate as a separate entity after the acquisition is completed. A merger is when a company is merged with another. Technically, it is still an acquisition of sorts but the terms could be much different. With a merger you could only have a swap of stock but could also have a combination of stock and cash. Most mergers seem to primarily involve stock. A merger could create an entirely new company, use the name of one company or a combination of the two organizations. Under a merger some of the management of the two companies could change as could the board of directors.|`|5vcASOYVaa	A= force<br>  m=will

There's no papers and he won't be out any money since your friend will still be paying.  Only if he suffers a loss can it become an issue.  But, regarding the security, have your friend pay you the $200.00 and then the full security will be between him and the landlord.  My girlfriend and I moved in together, split all the costs, but after about 4 months, she decided to move in with her boyfriend.  We had a signed lease - I just informed the landlord that she would be leaving - that I would remain and pay the rent by myself and that I was giving her her half of the deposit and he would just deal with me for the deposit when I moved out.  I am still there - it's been about 2 years now.|`|TL2XoF5baa	You have to give 30 days notice and pay for your 30 days whether you are there or not.

Do not roll unsecured debt into your home.|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	Yes you can. But, be very careful, you are not eliminating any debt, you are just moving it around.  This is how everyone gets "under water" on their mortgages. Your house is worth less than what you owe on it. You are getting the feeling of getting rid of your credit card debt, but you aren't. I know, it makes you feel like you are doing something. I did the same thing and I regret it. You have to change your habits. Your overspending got you into the situation you are in. I am not trying to be mean. I tell it like it is. I know because I fell into the exact same trap. You refinance your mortgage and pay off your credit cards. The only problem was that I did not stop spending on my credit cards. I felt like it was a 0 balance so I could just keep on going. I soon had just as much credit card debt as I had before I paid them off and now had a higher monthly house payment to boot. Do you see the trap? You must change your spending habits. Looking back, I would have kept the lower mortgage payment, paid off the cards, and closed the accounts. My wife and I are now getting back to sanity. I know this is going to sound like a commercial but I will tell you anyway. Before you do anything, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE read a book called the Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey. This is a guy we ran across on Fox Business Channel. He has an absolutely tremendous program to pay off debt and get you on the road to financial independence. After watching his show for a couple of weeks, we looked at each other and said this guy makes more sense than anyone we've ever heard. We have been on his "plan" since november and man, has it been great. If you are looking to pay off debt, this is the program. He also shows you how and why to set up emergency funds, pay off debt, save for kids college, invest, insurances, etc. It has really helped us out. We paid off both our cars ($800/month) almost a year early just by adjusting our attitudes and habits towards money. It has also helped us realize where our cash "drains" were by setting up a budget. Yes, I know, the dreaded "B" word. We now know where our money goes each month instead of wondering where it went.  In fact, tonight we are getting together with our new investment adviser for the first time. How cool is that? We now have our debts catagorized and are working exceptionally hard to get them out of our lives forever. We now use cash or debit for everything. It is money we already have and can't go into debt.<br>  I told you it would sound like a commercial. I get a little carried away by my new found enthusiasm and excitement.  Sorry.<br>  But seriously, do not fall into the same trap we did. You will have to carry the cards for a while longer as you pay them off. That's fine, just don't spend any more on the cards or incur any other debt. Keep your current mortgage and get your debts in order. Make sure all your debts are current before you start this program. Like I said above, if I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I would not have done it. I do not want you to go down the path that we went down. We are finally realizing our mistakes and are working diligently to correct them. Please don't make the same mistakes we did. You will be much better off if you have a solid plan of debt elimination rather than just moving debt around. Trust me.

OacSIfSiaa	I wish people would read and understand what a credit score is and how it works.  YES it does affect your score and it will also lower your score.  When they lowered you credit limit it changes your overall utilization ratio which is how much credit you have and how much you owe.  The higher the ratio, the lower your score.<br>  <br>  They no doubt lowered your limit because if your average daily balance was around $4000 then you had used well over 75% of your available credit on just that one card.  This lowers ones score also.<br>  <br>  You can read how your credit limit affects your score at the following links:<br>  Read about credit limits<br>  <a href="http://myfico.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/myfico.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=15" rel="nofollow">http://myfico.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/myfic...</a><br>  <a href="http://myfico.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/myfico.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=3" rel="nofollow">http://myfico.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/myfic...</a><br>  <br>  Your score will go down, but you shouldn't worry, it will be a small drop in your score and will over time (as long as your keep any other accounts current and below 30% of utilization.<br>  <br>  Hope this resolves your question.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Yes, it will hurt your score.<br>  For a top score you need to either pay in full each month, or make sure that your balances never exceeds 30% of your available credit.|`|24kFbAdsaa	The did this based upon your spending habits.  You had a $4800 balance on a $5000 limit.  That indicated to the bank that you like to use your credit card and they see a possibility that you could but the lower $500 limit which would generate over limit fees.<br>  <br>  Yes is will mess up your credit score.  They like to see no more than 30% of your max limit.  So, 30% of $5000 is $1500.  You can buy a lot of stuff for $1500.  But reduce your limit to $500.  30% of $500 won't even buy a week's worth of groceries and gas.  Much easier to bust your limit or exceed the 30% ratio.  A $200 balance on a $500 limit is a 40% ratio.<br>  <br>  The banks are saying they're reducing their risk, but what they are doing is generating more income through over limit fees.|`|kbJt4065aa	It will only briefly affect your credit score. I would actually pay off the card completely and stop using that one. Apparently they don't want your business and if you've paid on time you should be able to get a card that will appreciate your business. If the card has no balance on it, that will also show up after your next billing statement.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	It has nothing to do with it.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Normally, to have paid $4600 towards the balance of a $4800 loan would have brought your "debt to credit ratio" down to an impressive level.  But your credit card company screwed you royally.  They dropped your limit so excessively that now your "debt to credit ratio" is STILL not good.  If I were you, I'd finish paying off that $200, and cancel that stupid card.  Usually, I'd encourage you to just throw the card into a drawer and not use it anymore (but keep the account open) because it helps your score rating to have available credit on your cards, especially if you've had that card for a while.  But, first of all, I'd be irate if they did that to me and, secondly, having only $500 of available credit doesnt help your score any.  If you cancel, it will show up on your report as "cancelled by owner" and is not a bad mark. But, like the other poster suggested, I would send in a letter to the credit bureaus asking them to put a "footnote" on your credit report, briefly explaining why your average balance shows $4500 when your limit only shows as $500.  It's really simple:  just say<br>  <br>   "Dear blah blah credit bureau, please add a footnote onto my report regarding the history with blah blah credit card, and word it as such----'Available credit limit was lowered after a large sum was paid toward the balance of this loan.  Therefore, the average balance compared to the NOW available credit limit is not an accurate representation of my history'."    Sincerely............me<br>  <br>   This will clear things up to anyone in the future who may need to pull your report for a purchase you are making.  Since they arent very likely to ask you personally for an explanation it will suit you best to have the explanation already written as a footnote on your report.|`|8bd9b4b09234aea3505ffd5f84ad0affaa	notify the3 credit bureaus and add a foot note to your credit- but I also have heard, this will not effect your credit score.....but I would watch it.|`|f6415acc134f599e19024ed8d819a2b1aa	No, we've had that happen with our card a couple months ago and when I asked, the card holder said it wouldn't.
AcsvmXY4aa	for starter's what country and state are you in?
kbJt4065aa	The company my husband works for has a one week delay and only pays every two weeks. So, if you started working the Monday after their pay week, you wouldn't get a check yet by the next time they got paid two weeks later. Then, when they get paid next (4 weeks of working there), you would get paid for one week and your next check would be for two weeks worth of work and it would be consistent from there on out. <br>  I hate two week pay periods. They are absolutely brutal when you just start working there. There's no harm though in asking your boss when you will get your first paycheck just to verify.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Do you get paid monthly?<br>  If so you need to wait one week for them to process a check (at most).<br>  Even if you get paid every two weeks, it should never take more than 7 days to get a check. <br>  Never.<br>  Go talk to someone, some companies are in a financial mess.<br>  Tell them you will not work, if you are not going to get paid.<br>  /|`|uZEhrUrvaa	Yes dear, it depends on what kind of job you're doing.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	You seem to be on the right wavelength, but I'd reorder it slightly.<br>  <br>  First, say WHAT INTERESTS YOU ABOUT THE POSITION - so you've already said that it would offer you the chance to get experience working in a research environment, and say why you want this experience - but don't get into talking about long-term goals in case they think you're not committed to this position and only want to use it as a way in to something else.  You can also re-read the job description and mention the duties that specifically excite you.<br>  <br>  Next, say HOW YOUR EXPERIENCE MATCHES THE PERSON SPECIFICATION - so you say that you feel that you have the right skills, but you need to go into detail and give specific examples.<br>  <br>  Then, say that you WOULD LIKE TO WORK PART-TIME.  I suggest that you explain why, provided that it's a good reason.  If you want to work part-time because you study or you have children, then they are good reasons.  If you want to work part-time to fit around another job, then you need to be careful how much you give away because you don't want an employer to think that you're only going to have limited availability or anything.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	Say your Katherine Moennig ;)<br>  <br>  Start talking about your talents.  Tell them that you're applying because you have a general interest in gaining experience in (insert field). <br>  Let them know that you are dedicated to your work and dependable. <br>  Your resume should be well written & have some references readily available.<br>  <br>  Above all you want to stand out above the others, so learn about the business as much as you can from google & their website so that you get a little better grasp on the image & message that the company wants to portray.|`|5I4imquJaa	believe it or not, most employers want to hear the reason is because you need the money!<br>  <br>  if they know you need the money, they then know you will turn up, not just come in willy nilly whenever you like...<br>  <br>  if you need the money, you are more likely to turn up for work|`|aCDWwsisaa	Because the things you enjoy doing (the work that "satisfies" you) and your skillset are an ideal match for the requirements of the job...

XEcoJnt4aa	Personally, if I had to put down more than 10% , I would look for a different contractor. There are an awful amount of "fly by night" contractors out there. Get a contract. A start and finish date. Each and every thing to be done needs to be in that contract. Those contractors that require  a large down payment , seem to be less trustworthy, from my experience! Good luck with addition. have a nice day! My best case scenario would be nothing down at all, with the exception of maybe permit fees.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	Never ever ever pay the full amount up front. NEVER! There are people always on the hunt for suckers like that and it happens a lot more than you may think.  A contract isn't going to help you any if you've just given all your money to a scam artist.  And besides...even if the builder is legitimate, if you've paid him the entire amount up front, you have no leverage if he ends up doing a real crappy job.  Most reputable builders will either require NO up-front money, or about a 10% deposit.  If you get an estimate from a builder who wants the entire payment up-front, run away!!!

AA11573642	In a legal sense, if you have been unemployed, much before your notice period expires, you are entitled for unemployment benefits. <br>  But, if your resignation is shown in the relieving order, then you are not eligible for unemployment benefits.|`|AA11357056	No - whether your employer allows you to work the two weeks or not, you're leaving by your own choice.|`|qWytoOMmaa	If you are in the US and in a "work at will" job (not part of a union or working under a contract) then giving notice is generally a professional courtesy.  It is the "right" thing to do if you are considering using the company you are working for as part of your reference.  I decided to leave because... as opposed to I was fired because...  <br>  <br>  Work at will literally means you can leave at any time for any reason, and your company can fire you for the same.  Some companies will say thanks, pack up now.  Unless they are legally required to pay you through your notice, then it is very unlikely they will.  And depending on the laws where you are working, it may make you ineligible for unemployment.

ksLn21Jfaa	Finland has over-educated IT-engineers in this field for years and now the experts are more or less unemployed. You can't get rich by working in Finland because of the high taxation and high prices.<br>  <br>  Any open position in IT get hundreds of applications so practically your chances of getting a job are minimal. Finnish attitudes towards foreigners can be tough thing to overcome and generally getting a job is no easy task even for a native Finn either.  Many software engineering positions are currently being offshored to India and Asia because of lower costs. <br>  <br>  Many foreigners who have come to Finland have to start from the entry level jobs or start a new career from the bottom if their education is not qualified. (usually it is not)  Also unemployment has always been very high among immigrants.<br>  <br>  So forget what you've heard about Finland being so great place to work.

I wouldn't babysit for them, and when your sister leaves town again they can deal with it.
yCR6qg0baa	If you live in the U.S., say, "I will only ship to addresses in the United States." Unfortunately, all you can do is report them & put your item back up for auction. That's the risk you take when you sell electronics online.<br>  <br>  My husband sold something 2 years ago... I think it was a camera. Anyway, he started the bid at $100 or so. Then this guy bid like $300. Someone else bid like $350, and then he bid $400. Since this camera could have been purchased new for about $175, we knew something was up. Then my husband got this e-mail from this guy saying it was for his son's birthday present & that it needed to be shipped to KENYA (Africa)! Well, I don't know if you've ever watched Dateline's "To Catch an Identity Thief", but most identity thieves in the world are in Kenya & Nigeria (poor law enforcement). He said he didn't have PayPal, so he asked if he could mail a check. We said no, so he created a bogus PenPal with a non-working number... Ugh. Big hassle. Now if we want to sell something, we just use www.craigslist.org & list it in our local area for Cash only.|`|XItuKiZSaa	avoid ebay listing fees and scams. sell it at

vqdurAA5aa	While I do vertical spreads at times, I have none that expire in March. What I do have for March some naked $2.50 GM puts which were part of a diagonal spread at the time I wrote them. However, I just closed the long leg of the spread (January, 2010 $17.50 puts) leaving the March puts naked.<br>  <br>  The entire diagonal spread was an adjustment to a ratioed put spread expiring in January 2010. If you want to see the entire history (to date) of the spread see<br>  <br>  <a href="http://messages.yahoo.com/Business_%26_Finance/Investments/threadview?m=tm&bn=4686677%23optiontradestraderecommendations&tid=3362&mid=3363&tof=1&rt=2&frt=1&off=1">http://messages.yahoo.com/Business_%26_F...</a><br>  <br>  and the later posts linked to it.

And the degree you get will be a B.A. in Computer Applications....and not B.Sc. in Computer Applications. If you want to persue a Master's degree in the same field then you definitly need a maths background. BCA generally doesn't give high level jobs. Most of the students move to another fields for higher studies (like MBA). If you intend to do MBA after you are done with BCA then it is said to be a good combination but if you want to stay as just a graduate then you won't be able to rise from a level of Applications Programmer. <br>  <br>  Other computer related fields are B.E. in computer science, B.E.Softwares, B.I.T. , Multimedia and Graphics Designing etc.<br>  You may also go for advanced courses in Java, C, C++, C#, VB (dot).Net. <br>  You may also go for PGDCA i.e. Post Graduate Deploma in Computer Applications after your Bachlor's degree in any science/arts/commerse stream.<br>  Though B.E. and B.I.T. require maths so my advice.....either do graduation from your commerce stream and get advanced knowledge of computers or do BCA or Graphics Designing.

Around closing time, the payment was much higher than you expected.  Probably the interest rate was higher than what the loan officer first calculated.  To get the payment to a point that would "satisfy" you at the closing table, the loan officer reduced the escrow account significantly - resulting in your current shortage.<br>  <br>  If that's it, the words you're looking for are "PREDATORY LENDING".  Contact your state's agency that regulates lenders.  If you're in Texas, call 1-877-276-5550 to file a complaint.  The FBI is also getting after these people.

It just depends on where you want to work.  If you don't drive, you can take the R7 train from Trenton right to the  (Phila) city or take the train to NY. You should go on Monster.com to look for a job. You can put in the specific job you are looking for and the exact city of where you want to work. Also, take a trip to the city and walk around and put your resume in different places. The same with NJ and NY; again, it all depends on where you want to work but I can tell you there are so many different places in Philly, especially in the city. <br>  <br>  As far as meeting new people, again, you are in a great place. Philly has so many different places to go to as well as NY. Go on to www.gophila.com. It gives you many different multicultural places to go to in and around Philly. Also, myspace is a good place to meet new people and even reconnect with old friends.<br>  <br>  I hope some of this help and good luck with your new life.

But once you do it you can make on avarage about 100 dollars an hour.  It really depends on how good you are.  I have a friend who charges $500 minimum.  He only does big stuff, sleeves murals etc.  That $500 covers a session or two depending on how you spread it out.  My artist charges 120 an hour however I bring in new clients to the shop and sometimes I get a little break.<br>  <br>  *edit*You also have to have your own equipment, which for good equipment is spendy.|`|1261f754a1783085c7edd6698a407369aa	It would really depend on the experience, location, quality, and volume of customers.......research the requirements on the web|`|a7ad2100785a16ae0c2806de50d6d73caa	not sure how much they make, that probably depends on the area and the tattoo shop, but i do know the way to learn is to apprentice under a 'master' tattoo artist<br>  having previous art education helps, too

AA11931048	First, are you attending school at least half-time? If so, you may be able to defer your student loan payments until after you graduate. Also, if you do defer, you can make payments, but no payment will actually be due. Interest will accrue, but you can pay the interest so that it's not capitalized. <br>  <br>  If you can't defer, you may be able to ask for a forbearance. Or, there may be any another payment plan, such as income-sensitive, or interest-only that may be less.<br>  <br>  You also may want to consider consolidating your loans, which will lower the monthly payment. You extend the repayment period, but often times you can lock in a low interest rate too. <br>  <br>  But no matter which option you choose, contact your lender before you become past due. By helping you they ensure that they will get paid. And, you save your credit.|`|kXumdplBaa	We had a lot of problems too with layoffs....

Once you figure in his bonus it is better.<br>  <br>  In general surgeons earn more than actuaries, but there are actuaries who do earn more.  If you go to <a href="http://www.actuaryjobs.com/salary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.actuaryjobs.com/salary.html</a> you can see how type of actuary, years of experience and number of exams affects salary level.<br>  <br>  Often actuaries are promoted to high level executive positions - like CFO (Chief Financial Officer), etc.  If this happens, their salaries may be comparable to - or better than surgeons.  To get to these positions, an actuary needs to be an effective communicator.<br>  <br>  Doctors have a more high profile job, while actuaries are more low profile.  <br>  <br>  Actuaries protect the financial well being of the companies that employ them.  With this responsibility comes higher financial reward.|`|AA11843893	Actuaries can make more money than doctors, but not generally.

The gold would never lose its value. Inflation would be a thing of the past. This would take a major change of political thought by the FEDs, almost a new renaissance.

1552c96c3f7e2c806e83680cf9e07189aa	I would say to look for a location that is near other high traffic stores- location has everything to do with it! If you have a consignment shop that is in a location that only sees traffic during Monday through Friday, it isn't likely you are going to sell many of your items. Make sure it is near a weekend traffic center. If it is an a "chic" part of town, near antique stores, cafes, etc. you have a good chance of moving some merchandise!|`|iUJWCxYVaa	Of course, some shops of this nature are betterr than others, but here is the problem.  When you see something on consignment, it is generally up to you to keep track of whether or not it sold.  The shop often sells it, and you never see a dime, because they figure you forgot about the item, or they have not kept decent records, etc. They're not all that way, of course, but many can be. This is not generally the best way to sell stuff.  Remember, you don't get the full amount of the sale, as they store takes most of it.

Ti consiglio di rivolgerti all'Ufficio Vertenze competente per categoria, di un'istituzione sindacale.

Look at the job posting and the duties and fit what you do now into the categories of experience they are looking for. You are going to be asked "tell me about a time when....." with things like you went above and beyond for a customer, handled making a mistake, etc. These questions are answered in three parts: 1- the situation (one time I was helping a customer) 2- the action (no one else was available so I skipped my lunch to assist) and 3-result (the customer was so happy they called my manager to tell them whata great job I did).

Le banche in questi casi fanno stipulare al garante (fidejussore) un particolare tipo di fidejussione, chiamata fidejussione omnibus: una fidejussione che vale per garantire tutti i debiti presenti e futuri.<br>  In questo caso non riesco proprio a capire a cosa ti possa servire una fidejussione....|`|d57dac0790a4aa2cf0b6cc294441ec8faa	Ti conviene fare la fidejussione se ne hai la possibilità.<br>  Semplicemente il locatore mette a garanzia della banca una certa somma ,supponiamo l'affitto di un'anno ,questa somma non puo essere toccata da nessuno , ne da te ne dalla banca ne tantomeno dal locatore fino alla scadenza.Se a questo punto l'affitto è stato pagato normalmente la somma torna al locatore altrimenti tu hai diritto a rivalerti su quella somma e la banca te ne concederà una parte o tutta , dipenda dagli affitti pagati.Questo sistema è molto usato nell'affitto dei locali ad uso ufficio o pubblici , cosi chè chi affitta si premunisce prima di eventuali "fughe" dell'affittuario.<br>  Tuttavia credo sia difficile trovare qualcuno in grado di dare l'affitto di un'anno in garanzia alla banca e poi pagare te tutti i mesi normalmente , gli converrebbe fare un mutuo almeno diventa sua.|`|wGg5DHzDaa	Ciao<br>  francamente la tua domanda non e' chiarissima perche prima parli di locatore e poi di conduttore....Ad ogni modo la fidejussione bancaria e' un contratto tale per cui la banca si impegna, a semplice richiesta di colui che e' in possesso della fidejussione, di pagare quanto dovuto dal debitore. In parole spiccie se  caio va in banca e fa fare una fidejussione a favore di tizio, tizio nel momento in cui caio non paga le somme pattuite va in banca ed escute , cioè fa valere, la fidejussione e la banca paga a tizio cio' che era dovuto da caio. E' la banca che si preoccupa in fase di istruttoria di verificare la validità delle garanzie offerte, quindi tu non hai nessun obbligo di verificare i documenti prodotti alla banca stessa da chi ti deve fornire la fidejussione. La fidejussione rimane valida a tutti gli effetti una volta rilasciata e di solito ha una scadenza temporale quindi non si rinnova tacitamente. Chi ti deve far avere la fidejussione basta che vada in banca e la richieda. Gli diranno di quali documenti necessitano e quanto e' il costo.

If the residence is not habitable, most laws require the landlord to make any necessary repairs to make the residence habitable.  <br>  <br>  I don't believe he can "legally" shut off your water, unless you are in default of the lease, and even then, that would be a default by Landlord, which I don't think he would be dumb enough to do.  It's probably just a threat at this point. <br>  <br>  I would suggest to you that you "google" the fair housing commission and other Florida based housing authorities...there is a ton of tenant's rights information out there (and believe me, tenants have far more rights than they are aware of)...all you have to do is look...then write down what code sections or "rules" the landlord has broken, and write him a letter asking him to make the necessary repairs.  If he does not, I would recommend filing a formal complaint with local authorities.  BTW, $300 per month is cheap!!!  If your lease term is up (by the way, read your lease to understand the "terms" clearly), then the landlord has every right to raise your rent.  However, it's typcially 3% to 5% yearly increases.  I hope this helps you...good luck!

c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	She should do the offer ASAP. Just because the selling agent is "aware" of your interest doesn't keep him from accepting an offer from someone else. If someone puts in an offer before you, they can accept it right away (locking you out of the process) or make you go into a bidding war with the other buyer, and pay more than the current price. If you get your bid in and they accept it, another offer will not make you lose the house.<br>  Three business days is a really long time to not submit an offer, most real estate agents would have put the offer in within 24 hours and given the owners 24-48 hours to respond, and you would have had your answer by now.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	oh no, fire her butt.

M2AiWt85aa	Right now, in the starting phases of my website, my online marketing budget is $0.  That's right - a big, fat, goose egg!<br>  <br>  I am using the bum marketing method, and traditional offline marketing (with a flair) to get people to my site.  After that works, I will use some of the profit I make from that to start online marketing.  <br>  <br>  Let me take that back - I am still getting all of my ducks in a row (a lot of bird references, aren't there?), THEN I will be starting my free and inexpensive marketing campaign!<br>  <br>  Don't think you need to spend money to get traffic to your site!  Think smart, have a great site that offers value to your visitor, and use some awesome marketing (for free).  <br>  <br>  What kind of marketing?  <br>  *keywords (in content)<br>  *articles<br>  *blogging about your site<br>  *business cards<br>  *vehicle lettering <br>  *incentive programs on your site<br>  *forums<br>  *yadda, yadda, yadda<br>  <br>  Check out "bum marketing method".  And whatever you do, make sure you make your advertising UNIQUE!  We are sick of being "sold" to.  Entertain us with your "ads"...<br>  <br>  You CAN hire people to do all of this for you.  Due to your question, it seems like you have the money to go out and pay people to do this for you.  That should not make a difference in your strategy though.  Hire people to do this unique form of advertising for you.  (It will save you a lot of time!)  But, if you do the same thing that everybody else is doing - you will NOT stand out.  You need to hire people with a unique vision that scares you a little bit.  :)|`|RyyDI1Rbaa	￡500-￡600.

It depends on goals as well. Do you want to build the brand or your goal is transactional marketing. Branding is more expensive, transactional marketing fortunately can be very cheap - you can design a nice web site using a template and pay commission to affiliates if you have cool innovative product and a good affiliate network that sells for you.

SsfnitjXaa	No it means they are still taking applications for a while.  Now get busy and write them a thank you note for them seeing you and you will be happy to send them any other information that they may need.|`|Zadysvg5aa	I wouldn't panic at this time, two weeks is not that long.<br>  Consider that they maybe only allocate one or two hours a day for interviewing, and possibly on only one or two days a week.<br>  They will then make up a short list of candidates and bring them back for a second interview, probably with the person with whom they will eventually be working for.<br>  The fact that is was in a friendly relaxed atmosphere is a positive thing.<br>  The next interview will be more probing about you strengths and weaknesses.<br>  Good Luck|`|jNx9tVxqaa	I have always looked on that as a standard closing statement that they say to everyone with the possible exceptions of someone they are keen to employ. <br>  The other answerers are right, of course. But in two weeks time my interest will have faded and I hope they do not bother sending me a letter saying We are sorry. I will have applied for more jobs and forgot about them as soon as I send each  application off (I do keep copies of everything though just in case).|`|NR1Ftmk7aa	2 weeks is a pretty standard amount of time if they have other applicants to interview, i wouldn't take this to meany anything. Good luck!|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	If they say they will call in two weeks, thats exactly what they mean. They need time to deliberate over all the candidates etc. Don't worry! The waiting is always hard!|`|89dbd497fcd8c6cdb3d35fd8f19c44e1aa	It takes about two weeks to decide, no one will give you straight after the interview. Wait...
YCXxP43Laa	Not for only five days late. It does depend on the terms of your tenancy agreement, but usually he would have to go to court, and it wouldn't be worth it if you are paying... albeit a few days late.<br>  <br>  I would tell your landlord of your difficulty and explain that you will be paying five days late.|`|LpVwWJVsaa	Sometimes people confuse the demand for possession (a statement saying that you have 5 days to pay or court proceedings will be initiated) and an actual eviction notice.  I know that most states have proper court proceedings that you have to go through prior to being evicted.  I would check your local landlord/tenant rules by googling your state and landlord/tenant rules.  Most states have a handbook available in PDF format.<br>  <br>  I would also check the eviction laws in your state.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	nope. Depending on your state laws she/he has to give you at least 30 days notice before eviction.  In most states you have to be at least 60 days in arrears. <br>  In Georgia you have to be 60+ days late and the property owner MUST give you 30 days notice in a WRITTEN eviction notice. <br>  <br>  Call the Court house in your town to find out what exact rules are in place where you live. <br>  Always deal with people fully armed with information, most people consider all other people idiots (especially when it comes to people renting their property out, they usually think "well it is my house I can do what I want" But they can't, if you have a property that you rent, once it is rented you have to follow your state/local renting laws. <br>  If you have a lease, look at it.|`|AA12112469	I agree with the other answer. When I had the house with my boys, I was never able to pay the full rent. However, I had discussed this with my landlord after the idiot that left me hanging left. Read your rental agreement. If you have any other questions, I suggest you contact your local court. I ended up getting evicted.|`|Maho3P5kaa	they shouldn't be able to kick you out. at the most you'll probably have to pay a late fee which varys based on the lease agreement. but let your landlord know you're goin got be late. then they may cut you some slack with the late fees if you tell them in advanced|`|z08TDQXHaa	A landlord does not have to have a reason to kick you out. They can kick you out for nothing.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Only if he immediately starts the eviction process and is stubborn.   But, 5 days will not give him enough time.|`|RZzMse3Haa	Your past payment history is immaterial.  They can legally evict you the first time you are late.  They have to give you a chance to pay though. Landlords typically serve a 3 day pay or quite notice which states you have 3 days to pay the owed rent or move out.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Well, if he has not even served any notices yet, then just go talk to him. Most landlords are pretty reasonable with good tenants.  Just keep in mind what his legal rights are also.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	technically...yes they can (depending on what is written in your lease and following the state's rental laws for amount of delinquency).  in practice, they usually won't kick out someone for being 5 days late, especially if they have always paid on time in the past.  your best bet is to talk to the landlord though.  you will get much further by keeping him/her in the loop than trying to avoid him/her.  landlords hate that.  <br>  <br>  also, it is not the landlord's fault that the place is expensive.  his own equity has gone down and his taxes have gone up.  if the comps in the neighborhood are currently 1100, should he rent out for 900 just to be kind to people?  don't think so!  rental property is a business, after all.|`|AA10263406	Depending on your lease agreement, yes they CAN. Will they? Most likely not, unless you are paying well under market rent or they want the house for some reason.|`|23SkYEw5aa	you are on a month to month lease.  With 30 days notice, he can ask you to leave - without giving any reason.<br>  <br>  Talk with him and find out why.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Be sure to acknowledge you are late and send that 25 dollar fee with your check.
ej9ijnS7aa	So the mortgage and deed are entirely in HER name?  Can she qualify on her own for such a deal?  Is the home just sitting there empty now?<br>  <br>  Something doesn't smell right about your question.|`|AA11206283	Responsible married couples who plan on staying married don't make decisions that way.<br>  <br>  JOBS? In THIS Ecomomy?<br>  <br>  You can find a house anywhere.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	This isn't about a house.<br>  <br>  This is about her having respect for the other partner in a marital relationship.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in ultimatums of a marriage, but this is one of them.  Tell her to pick up the phone, call the Realtor, and see what can be worked out as far as getting the contract cancelled.<br>  <br>  If it cannot be cancelled, I would ask your wife, "Well, how are you going to get a loan without my signature?"<br>  <br>  I would also make sure that starting TODAY that any and all credit cards that you have jointly, be cancelled...you get your OWN as well as separating all bank savings, checking accounts, etc.<br>  <br>  Again, this isn't about purchasing things, it's about respect.|`|23SkYEw5aa	dude, she did tell you. . . just not in words.<br>  <br>  I have read your other posts about your dislike of her habits.  It sounds like she checked out of the marriage and is now checking out of town.|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	Well it seems that she has taken on the entire responsibility on her own (including paying for it)obviously she can't sign for you.California has the highest unemployment rate in the nation-so what she did was just plain foolish(sorry) I truly hope she went out there and looked at the house and didn't make a move like that via the internet.so many people have been scammed that way already people post houses for sale that they don't even own,collect deposits and you end up S.O.L.(i think your next posting should be in the legal section of Y/A does anyone know a good divorce lawyer in Maryland?)|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Ummmmm...no.<br>  <br>  You don't go and buy a house all the way across the country without telling your spouse.<br>  While maybe she's right that you need to be more open to new ideas and talking about such things, and maybe it will ultimately even be the best thing for you to move there, you still don't do things like that behind your spouse's back.  <br>  The fact that she doesn't even know what sort of job she's going to get once she gets out there tells me that you would have had every right to be negative about the idea.  This house that she bought is going to need to be paid for.  You don't buy a house not knowing HOW you're going to get the money to pay for it.  There is a proper way to do things.  I hope that your name isn't anywhere on the mortgage, because her irresponsible way of handling this is very likely going to ruin the credit of anyone whose name is on it.<br>  Personally, if my husband did something like that to me, he'd be signing divorce papers right alongside his mortgage paperwork.|`|4MypYVHYaa	How did she buy a house in California without you knowing it? California is a community property state. Even if she decide to purchase a house in California the husband would have to sign a quit claim deed prior to the escrow closing so the deed could be recorded as a married woman as her sole and separate property.<br>  <br>  The only other way she could legally do this purchase is with a corporation buying the property or she did not tell the lender , title officer or escrow officer that she was married, thus taking title as a single woman, this is called fraud in California.<br>  <br>  Now as I see it I agree with some of the other posters you guys have a few serious problems that need to be worked out, if you decide to stay in Maryland of come to California.<br>  <br>  You need to take your problem to a marriage counselor.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you,good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|ePkiOzPSaa	I don't know your circumstances, but for me that would be unacceptable.  Maybe you are the type of person who always shies from that stuff and needs to be pushed into it.  If you are even asking this question, it sounds like you are.  To me, that's grounds for divorce, your wife appears to be pretty controlling, doesn't trust you, and makes huge life decisions for the both of you without even involving you.  That is a huge decision, and most marriages are built on foundations of trust and compromise.  If you are happy being completely controlled by someone (and honestly, it seems like some people are), then I wouldn't worry about this.  If it was me, it would probably be over at that point.  I would never want that kind of relationship.|`|8ne6XJ5Naa	I think that in that kind of stuff if she is your wife she need to tell you I mean you are a couple aren't you? I don't want to sound inpolite but if you wife did something like that I advise you to keep your eyes wide open beacuse with a woman like that you never know what is behind.  Couple means 2 and because of that the decisions must be taken by 2 otherwise you have a communication problem or something worst. <br>  <br>  Sorry it's only my humble opinion.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Sounds like you nad the wife need to talk! If it were me in your shoes, I would feel like my trust was violated and that possibly your mate wants to leave you. <br>  You don't just go buy a house in another state without telling your spouse for no reason. There is something else going on. I mean it would be different if it were a vacation beach house or something but she is talking about moving! <br>  Best advice, talk to her. (AND Call a GOOD lawyer)|`|p1gzHgAraa	so is she wanting a divorce? and is she planning on moving there herself? sounds like she is just doing whatever she wants, without regarding you at all. not exactly a healthy marriage. <br>  <br>  you need to sit down with her and see what her plans are and if you are included-i couldnt be part of a marriage where im not treated with respect and given 50/50 power in all decisions.|`|TL2XoF5baa	Hey, take a chance and go with it..  As far as Cali go's..  Most people are leaving the state.  The whole state is basically hispanic and the taxes are going to go off the charts there. Someone has to pay their HUGE deficit..  I think I read sales tax is going to be bumped up to 11%|`|T72MvudVaa	Of course it's not right.<br>  <br>  But to go in a different direction from everyone else, let's assume it's not that she wants a divorce. Can she be bipolar? Or have any other kind of mental instability? If not, then read above...|`|ikXRqWxUaa	WTF!  she bought a home in another state and didn't tell you? there are so many things wrong here that i don't even know where to start.  more is going on here than meets the eye.  are you sure that she's not clandestinely seperating finances in anticipation of leaving you?  it sounds to me like her behavior is that of someone making an "end run".  it also sounds like you will have very little choice about her leaving to CA, and that if you say no, it basically gives her an excuse to walk.  <br>  <br>  she has not done a good thing.  marriage is about sharing and being a team.  she has gone rogue and you have to wonder what else she is keeping from you.  i am just hoping that she did not fraudulently add you to the mortgage of the California home.  this is a huge red flag and it's time to have a very long chat this weekend.

qWytoOMmaa	I'll tackle this from the HR prospective.  If what is happening when this manager "manages" the people around him is not conducive to a productive work environment, and/or is degrading, demeaning, slanderous, and/or has harassing overtones, he may actually be putting his company at legal risk.  Certainly he is making it difficult for people to do their job effectively - and that causes undue burden and potential financial hardship to the company.<br>  <br>  So what to do?  I'd consider a fact based conversation with HR that might sound something like this:<br>  <br>  "Mr. (managers name) is very difficult to work with.  When he speak to me he says (quote exactly what the manager says to you that you find disagreeable).  I believe that others may feel the same way.  It make is very hard for me to focus on my job.  I've tried to solve this by (state what you have done on your own to solve this). I don't know what else I can do."  Then sit back and let them ask questions that will help this situation be solved.

lmT3zXa9aa	If you are an "at will" employee (not covered by a contract), and the policy is spelled out in an employee handbook which you have indicated that you have read  then the employer has every right to withhold your pay for that day.  Sick leave is a benefit given to you by your employer, and the employer can dictate how it can be used.  However, if other employees have gotten paid under circumstances identical to yours then you should take up the issue with your human resources department (if there is one) or talk to your boss again in a calm manner to plead your case, but you'd better be willing to make sure the same thing doesn't happen again.|`|7znFg0QEaa	Paid sick leave is not covered by any federal law, some states have it.  Check your state law.<br>  <br>  If not, depends entirely upon Company policy or contract.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Most businesses have specific policies regarding the use of sick time. And in most cases, it includes proper notification which is a designated time prior to the ordinary start of work. The exceptions are genuine emergencies such as accidents. This is not a law, but a typical policy at a business. They are not obligated to pay you sick time, they have elected to provide that as a benefit. It is not unreasonable for you boss to require proper notification, she is trying to operate a department and it is difficult to plan on a minute by minute basis.<br>  <br>  Take this as experience and next time ensure that you make the decision to call out within a reasonable time that allows proper notification.|`|A7cXnCwpaa	If you don't get sick days, you probably won't get paid and calling off too many times can get your fired here in Texas.<br>  <br>  Are you entitled to sick days on your job?<br>  <br>  That is the question.<br>  <br>  It is supposed to be covered in yoru employee handbook -- assuming you got one.<br>  <br>  In Texas, if you work an hourly job, especially with a private security contractor or another small employer and you call off, you generally will NOT get paid. No work, No pay!<br>  <br>  UNIONIZE!

The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Search engine optimization is the key to elevating your website on major search engines which involves placement of indexable "keyword" metatags on your opening webpage.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	?

JIwbiE8kaa	The best answer I can give is this...its up to you.  It all depends on what you want out of it.  When you claim zero, you are telling the government to take all they can and hold on to it throughout the year.  When you file the next year, you then get most of this money back.  By claiming zero you almost always eliminate paying taxes when you file...remember I said ALMOST always.  When you increase your exemption, you are telling the government to take less throughout the year, meaning you have more in your pay check.  You make 28k a year, with the economy how it is now you may want to claim 1 and get a little more throughout the year...still allowing for a return when you file as you have 3 people in your household.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck,|`|AA11284831	As a married taxpayer with a non-working spouse and a child, you can safely claim up to 6 withholding allowances and just about break even at filing time.  If that makes you uneasy, cut it to 5.  Claiming either 0 or 1 would result in WAY too much tax being withheld from your pay.  Here's how it breaks out:<br>  <br>  Self:  1<br>  Spouse:  1<br>  Non-working spouse + one job:  1<br>  Child:  1<br>  Child Tax Credit:  2<br>  <br>  Total:  6<br>  <br>  The object is NOT to get a large refund but to come as close to breaking even as possible at filing time.

kbJt4065aa	The money won't be in there quite yet. The refund goes to the account that made the payment. While you paid with a debit card, it must be verified by Visa and have that little Visa symbol on the front. More then likely, the transaction was treated as a credit card transaction. <br>  I would think that the refund would have been put back on the card you used to buy it. HOWEVER, every bank processes those a bit differently. My bank takes almost a week to process a refund and mere moments to process a payment. <br>  Look at the payment methods on your account and verify that there isn't some old credit card you forgot about still listed on your account somewhere.<br>  I would wait about three business days, probably about Wednesday and see if it made it in. Contact your bank at that point and find out how long it takes for them to process a refund. They may be able to see that it is processing even if it doesn't show up on your account balance quite yet.

Go to www.eeoc.gov they have lots of info about why this is against the law.<br>  <br>  What you are going to need to show is that the manager terminated you close to the date you asked for leave and that her actions were based on pregnancy discrimination.<br>  <br>  While you can file a complaint with the EEOC yourself, pregnancy discrimination has its own nuances and you would be better served if you have a local employment lawyer look at your case.

Non c'entra nulla il fatto di esser stato libero professionista l'anno precedente, ciò che conta è l'attuale stato di lavoratore dipendente.

Of course not.  And when you look at a stock that is beaten down to these levels it is the same thing.  It's like buying the $2 car, and the only reason to do so is to hope you can turn around during some euphoria and sell it to some other sucker for $3 to make a buck.

Value will fluxuate.  <br>  <br>  If there is a mass production of dogfood after you purchase it for $10 a bag and there are massive sales of it by the Grocery Stores, it could be valued at $5 bag.|`|AA11639059	Watch Antiques Roadshow on your PBS station and you will see an abundance of examples. Someone fishes something out of the junk from an Attic that has to be cleared out, and then finds out this "junk" is worth a fortune to the right kind of buyer in the right kind of sale. There was an old song about an auction where a dusty old violin was getting no bids. A man came up, blew off some dust, adjusted the strings, and then played a lovely melody. Suddenly everyone and their dog wanted to bid on that violin.<br>  <br>  There are two approaches to looking at stock market investments. Some look at earnings, so the price to earnings ratio is a factor. A company with a high P/E either is priced because of expectations of a great future, or that the price is in decline because the future earnings will be equally dismal. Others look at equity. Although earnings affect equity, it isn't the whole story. If some buggy whip company were to disband when they heard about Henry Ford's success, then if there were a great deal of equity the stockholders would have something when the company closed. Otherwise they would get nothing for their investment.<br>  <br>  I invested in a company that was dirt cheap, a penny stock, but it had some underwater technology at a time when that was needed for an offshore oil exploration boom at the time. The cost was cheap but the perceived value was higher. The company changed their game plan and borrowed money to invest in some existing onshore oil wells. They did not pursue, or at least not successfully, the sale or licensing of their technology. Debts grew, payments were due, so they sold their underwater machine to satisfy some, but not all, of their debts. The value disappeared. The cost didn't. The cost of the shares did not change, the value was what the company was able to make of the assets (money) that was invested in them. ArecelorMittal, the big international steel maker, bought up junk. The garbage mills of failed or failing steel companies. They cleaned them up and made them work. They took something with no apparent value and gave it value. There was a cost involved, but comparing what they paid for the facilities to what those are now worth today there appears to be a disconnect. Actually, they are still connected, but there are separate steps. If done well, then value is made or expanded. If not done well, then value evaporates and disappears. <br>  <br>  A baby is priceless in the eyes of a normal mother, but as an adult that child has to make his or her own value. The cost has nothing to do with the value then.|`|TAGC3FNOaa	cost is how much money you pay, but it could be more valuble, either because of sentimental values etc.<br>  <br>  or if something is really cheap, its good value cus its better than what you pay for it|`|Get4HnNKaa	the reward is worth any amount of effort.|`|wu47J6WPaa	it means things that are cheap or free can be of value to you too, the best things in life are free!
7PDD5NlAaa	I advise you to ring your local tax office.<br>  <br>  You may find this site helpful www.direct.gov.uk|`|96af43a6ab3bf4045a9898acf5153bb9aa	If they are employing you and you are getting a salary then they have to give you a pay slip that includes deductions fo NI; tax etc  and they have to pay the legal minimum wage otherwise it could be something illegal going on - also most places of work have insurance to cover employees, should something happen to you and you are not on the official payroll - it could be a problem, the next thing is that even if you are temp, you still have the benefits as a worker whether they are permanent or not - the link below is for Directgov - and gives some good advice, you can also talk to people if it is still not clear.|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	I am in the U.S. and I can tell you that here we have to pay taxes, even for temp jobs, but the temp agency takes taxes out of our checks.  Wait and talk to the boss.|`|60ae6d23dffe568b5c9ec2b1938ea05eaa	you should be getting a pay slip temp or not|`|ROPLbLW9aa	everyone who works is entitled to a receipt for that work and the pay that was given for it. Helps prevent tax cheating|`|qgr6Q4qbaa	Hiya<br>  Like others have said the job you are doing is as an employee (for example you have a 'master-servant relationship', and you have to do the job yourself - they would not accept you sending someone else to work in your place) so you are not Self-Employed.  If they disagree then you should contact HM Revenue & Customs, who call this 'status' (ie your status is an employee or self-employed person).<br>  <br>  As an employee, your employer is liable to calculate and deduct any tax or National Insurance Contributions (NIC) that are due.  If you didn't give them a P45 form when you started working for them (the P45 form would have been given to you by your last employer), they should have asked you to compete a P46 form - if you're leaving it's probably too late to worry about this now.<br>  <br>  They should be giving you a payslip whether you are a temp or not.  Like you put in your other question, they should also give you a P45 when you leave this job - the P45 will show how much pay they gave you and how much tax was deducted, it will not show details of NIC.<br>  <br>  If they haven't deducted your tax (if you are liable to pay tax, you haven't actually said how much you've earned), or refuse to give you payslips/P45, contact HMRC for advice & ask them to help you.  HMRC might be able to give them a friendly phone call to see if they need any help, which should get things moving for you!<br>  <br>  I suspect either:<br>  - They haven't deducted tax from you by accident, thinking that they didn't need too,<br>  - Or, they have correctly deducted tax from you, but didn't add you on to their payroll computer system as you are temp staff.  This would mean their computers haven't printed you a payslip like the other employees.  They think this is okay & don't realise they still need to provide you with payslips (whether they are printed, typed or hand written!)<br>  <br>  Hope it's sorted out quickly for you!  If THEY have any questions, they should contact HMRC Employer's Helpline on 08457 143 143.|`|h2pgvZYuaa	I would think, for your personal tax reasons, you should be able to request any documentation of your pay, hours, or anything else pertaining to your job (but your job only) from your employer, no matter if you are a temp or not.  Definitely talk to the boss.  I would recommend not saying the "In case something illegal is going on" thing though ;-)|`|4gjPQFBDaa	By law, your employer must give you a payslip - when or before you are paid your wages. It must include your gross pay, take-home pay and any deductions.<br>  <br>  If you haven't received a payslip then you should first try talking to your work. If that doesn't help then you can apply to an Employment Tribunal.<br>  <br>  Just have a chat with your boss when she gets in. She might say that you are required to pay your own taxes (in which case you'll be classed as self-employed) but that should have been advertised with the job - and it may well have been (as you walked into the surgery). <br>  <br>  Try www.direct.gov.uk for more help or phone up HMRC to check everything is above board. I'm sure they'll be happier to hear from you personally and knowing you want to sort the problem.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!
WuDXQGBgaa	yes,if there's a debt owed on a joint return then the entire refund will be offset,but you may qualify to file an injured spouse 8379 form to get back your portion of the refund(which will take 8-14 weeks to be processed).if you can't wait that long you can file married/separate although that may result in a much smaller refund vs. married/joint where you usually benefit more because you pay less taxes.|`|A1kiUMgvaa	If you file a joint return they can take any refund that the return generates regardless of which of you earnings resulted in the refund.  You can file separately or as an injured spouse to avoid the IRS taking your portion of any refund.  Before you do any of this you should consult with someone that can make a comparison for you.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	YES to all of your questions. If you file jointly and he has debts, his debts become yours.|`|jpqSnCpuaa	if you file jointly they will take yours too|`|dEhGP14daa	Yes they can take yours as well for the student loan if you file joint, you can file a "injured spouse"  form (I had to do that but we weren't married when the student loan was taken out)  saying the debt is his and his alone but that can delay your refund 6-8 weeks and it would still be up to the irs if any portion of your refund should be taken. Same for the business if you file joint you are saying your debt, and income are joint and they will take it.|`|wALSmoHtaa	Unfortunately the answer is yes.  As long as you two are married, they can take your return as well as his to satisfy the debt.  The only possible way is to either file separate or file an injured spouse claim.|`|G9ruFZtbaa	I would absolutely not file with him. If if he tries to convince you to because it will reduce his liability. Your whole tax returned will be swallowed by his debt. Also if you do not file with him now you help avoid a bad situation because he may want to file with you over and over again if you start it now. It would be better for you to file on your own-if you want to see a return. Most tax preparers will not allow you to file separately unless you are separated. So you should go alone to the tax office and say married filing separately. That was if applicable you can get earned income credit and everything you deserve come back to you.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Hint, "my money" is a problem statement in a marriage.<br>  <br>  Yes, the IRS gives you the right to file MFS and/or the injured spouse form, but neither tackles the underlying problem of the debt and the fact that if he's working as a contractor, he's got to put money aside for taxes.<br>  <br>  By the way, if he's doing a lot of contractor work, there won't be a refund, so the injured spouse form won't be an option.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If you file a joint return, then there is no such thing as "my money" and "His money" nor is there "my tax debts" and "His tax debts" Everything is simply "ours." <br>  <br>  First, all the money you paid in will be applied to your tax liability. If there is extra that results in a refund, they will apply it to the student loan debt. <br>  <br>  Filling separately may protect your refund from his debts but its not a good idea. Typically you'll pay more taxes overall by filling separately. It may mean you get a refund instead of it going to his student loans, but the amount you get will be less than the amount they would apply to his loans if you filled jointly.

ZPmqYNuwaa	This is a great question and I hope a ton of people answer because I would also find this information invaluable.  My fiance and I recently went in for a mortgage consultation, they pre approved us for $300,000 with a 10% down payment.  I make $54,000 a year, and my fiance makes $30,000.  I don't have the other information in front of me, but we have yet to decide how much of the loan we will actually use.  We are in a very similar situation and are wondering how difficult it would be to manage the full loan amount, we will probably borrow around $260,000.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

xbmxVmxzaa	DOVE APRIRE:Cercare locali posizionati in zone di forte passaggio pedonale, vicino a scuole, banche, oratori, giardini pubblici, mercati, cinema ecc..   ben visibili con ampia vetrina frontale e con possibilità di parcheggio. Accertarsi che vi sia almeno un servizio igienico e che nella zona laboratorio vi sia una finestra di grandezza <br>  10% della superficie del laboratorio stesso (in caso non vi sia, chiedere giudizio preventivo presso l'ente competente <br>  facendo notare l'inserimento successivo di condizionatori) <br>  La scelta del locale è fondamentale per la riuscita del business.<br>  COME APRIRE. <br>  > Gelateria Artigianale (artigiano)<br>  > Negozio di Vicinato (necessario il Rec)  <br>  > Gelateria Bar (con licenza di somministrazione SAB)<br>  Dopo aver "fermato" il locale assicurandosi di effettuare contratti con l'appoggio del Vostro Commercialista, <br>  contattare sul posto un elettricista, un idraulico e farsi fare preventivi delle varie opere da eseguire secondo i  disegni.<br>  Come si può ben immaginare i costi totali dell'operazione sono variabili in funzione della grandezza del locale e delle finiture <br>  che si vorranno eseguire. Per far sì che l'operazione diventi un affare e non una ambizione di grandezza, <br>  Diciamo che con un investimento di circa €. 60.000-120.000 ( dipende se lo fai con un pò di usato). potrai farcela, il GELATO RENDE!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Non so in quale parte d'Italia sei, cmq se vuoi, ho un azienda di attrezzature ed arredamenti per questo settore, sono disponibile a consigliarti, contattami nella mia e-mail pubblica....................<br>  senza impegni da ambo le parti.<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|S2HYgUh9aa	Il consiglio é quello di capire quali sono i gusti della gente e saperti differenziare bene rispetto alla gelaterie giá esistenti.<br>  <br>  Direi che quello dei gelati é un mercato maturo. Quindi se vuoi fare clienti devi necessariamente soffiarli agli altri concorrenti.<br>  <br>  Prima cosa: capisci quante gelaterie ci sono nel tuo paese (o quartiere se vivi in una grande cittá), stima quante persone ci vanno e capisci se é semplice o facile convincerle a passare ad una gelateria diversa (le gelaterie esistenti hanno un grosso nome/tradizione? Sono famose per fare gelati di alta qualitá? etc).<br>  <br>  Seconda cosa: Capisci come differenziarti. Cosa potresti fare meglio degli altri? A questo proposito ti consiglio di visitare gelaterie in paesi diverso dal tuo che hanno avuto particolarmente successo. Cosa fanno di particolare? C′é qualcosa che potresti copiare?<br>  <br>  Dopo questa analisi dovresti anzitutto capire se ha senso aprire una gelateria, e se la risposta é affermativa, capire cosa é necessario fare per portare avanti con successo la tua attivitá.|`|mZZ1pOM0aa	L'idea mi sembra buona, e, secondo me hai buona probabilità di riuscita. Non ho esperienze di gestioni, ma ti parlo come consumatore di gelato. Come in qualsiasi altra attività c'è molta concorrenza, per cui se vorrai inserirti ed emergere dovrai essere meglio degli altri. Il consiglio che ti do è quindi di puntare su un prodotto di QUALITA'. Impiega ingredienti sani, genuini, frutta vera, evita di farlo con le polverine. All'inizio ci guadagnerai meno, ma alla lunga verrai ripagato con una maggiore clientela. Per lo stesso motivo non fare porzioni micro, ma fai porzioni abbondanti. Non mettere come tuo traguardo quello di fare subito i soldi: è la peggiore via. Punta invece su un buon prodotto, impara bene il lavoro. Fai che si diffonda la voce che da te il gelato è buono e vedrai che la clientela aumenterà. Poi, stai tranquillo arriveranno anche i soldi. Un ultimo consiglio: il locale dovrebbe essere ubicato dove ci sia la possibilità di parcheggiare le auto; ancora meglio se nei paraggi ci sono delle panchine per fermarsi a degustare il gelato.<br>  Poi buona fortuna!|`|Xq3mJdN2aa	siiiiiii: aprila vicino casa mia....!! ;-) falla colorata e metti anke gli yogurt... buona fortuna per la tua attività|`|RLBsepOjaa	Mi raccomando; Fai il pistacchio BBBONO, sennò non mi vedi!

If the income was on a W-2 it won't make any tax difference to him since he  wouldn't owe any tax anyway.

Things like BMW and Mercedes aren't U.S.<br>  <br>  Cars will continue to get made one way or another as long as there's demand. Sure it might require some centralization or even government overseeing the means of production, but they're not going to vanish. If anything you'd simply see people more likely to buy foreign imports. Some manufacturers would be certain to survive just fine.<br>  <br>  Anyway, no, it wouldn't be a good idea to buy 3 or 4 cars. Cars by their nature require maintenance and often require warranty work, and if you buy from a manufacturer that goes kaput, getting replacement parts, etc. could be expensive or impossible. There's also strong likelihood of innovation occurring in areas like fuel efficiency in the future, so anything you stocked up on would likely go down in value over time.<br>  <br>  There might be good deals on nice top quality cars out there right now that might be worth looking into for resale later, but that would be about it.

Instead, his point is that there is no simple way to solve over-population and poverty, and that in order to solve the problem, they needed to stop thinking about/speaking of the poor as if they were some kind of livestock to be traded/manipulated to the most benefit.<br>  <br>  The time it was written was a difficult one for the whole of the U.K., and there were many ridiculous plans to solve economic problems.  This was Swifts response to the vast majority of them, since most Plans spoke of the poor more as "things" or "problems" rather than as people.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :0)

You have to be careful when using SEO some people might offer you 1000urls for your site for peanuts but if you pay peanuts you get peanuts, these sites will use irelavant links off your site and submit them using software really quickly. If you do this google will pick up on it and will punish your site by sandboxing it - basically put you lower in the rankings. The best companies to rely on are companies who do it manually without using nasty software to sandbox your site. They will use deep links with highly ranked sites therefore putting your site higher in the rankings. You could pay for 1000 irelavant submissions and risk getting punished for peanuts or pay about ￡100 for 200 relavant links submited slowly and carefully to avoid getting your site sandboxed and your site will benifit much more. <br>  LOOK AT THIS SITE! it will give you a much better idea<br>  www.socialsubmit.co.uk|`|RjS66IIFaa	Search engine optimisation involves two things<br>  On page SEO.

In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|760c9a7880ffb496e79cab8b9118c0a7aa	Every SEO has own optimization strategy, but goal is how to get fast ranking, fast traffic and Getting Conversion.

Since they have a higher priority (someone paid extra to get them delivered faster) they are the first packages to leave the sorting facility/local hub. <br>  <br>  Depending on how many packages are at that hub, unless your package has some sort of high priority sticker on it, it will be put into normally delivery queue and whenever a truck comes to get it, they'll get it. <br>  <br>  Usually you'll know from the UPS website because when it is scanned and put into a truck your tracking message will say "Out for delivery".

r73Ej1sjaa	Like what was said, all labels have been severely hurt by people downloading music off the computer. They aren't making that much money when you purchase an album or song off iTunes. Now has the recession hurt them, yes and no. But they have been in a decline for a while now. I'm sure their sales went up when the creator of napster was arrested, but look at it now. A few years later and people are downloading movies off the internet. Personally I don't think I have bought a cd in the past 3 years. If I like a song I will try and make the effort to purchase it from iTunes. But usually it gets played on the radio enough to not justify the purchase. I think they are really cashing in making Movies and DVD's. Jonas Brothers have had countless number of movies along with Miley, Hannah and all the others. In my honest opinion, I think iTunes and those dvd's are the only thing keeping the music labels paid. EVERYONE has an iPod, even my grandmother who is 89 has Frank Sinatra on hers.  But what do I know, I don't own a record label nor do I follow the music scene.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	the music industry is being severely squeezed by downloading and sharing songs.  It matters not whether the downloading is free or paid, and sharing legal or illegal -- an increasing majority of listeners seem unwilling to pay or unwilling to pay very much.
nYnZr8AMaa	As the other answerer explained, you are taxed on your net income, and the tax rate is the same as for employment income.  <br>  <br>  The potential tax benefit here is that you may now be able to deduct certain expenses that you would have incurred regardless, such as the portion of your home that you use for business purposes, a percentage of your automobile expenses, and a percentage of your mobile phone, among others.  But in order to deduct these items they have to be reasonable amounts, they have to have been incurred to earn income and they have to be prorated to represent business use only.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, if your expenses exceed your gross income, then you will have a business loss that can be deducted from your employment income.  But if you report a loss year after year, then eventually Canada Revenue may investigate and if there is no reasonable expectation of profit then they will deny the losses.<br>  <br>  See below for the CRA page on the types of business expenses that you can deduct.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Not enough information.  The earnings are not enough to change your tax bracket and you gave no dollar figure for you expenses.  It looks like you have neither improved nor diminished your tax standing.  Also, since you mentioned gas, did you also depreciate the vehicle or include the maintenance expense?  Good you have the accountant.  He will advise you further.|`|5dXsErAaaa	You get taxed on your net profit which is revenue minus expenses so you would have to figure out how much profit you made and how much time you spent providing the service and that would give you an idea how much per hour you are making. If it is less than your current employment why bother. If you are loosing money you are loosing more than you are saving on your taxes claiming a business loss again why bother. If you are claiming a loss every year then Canada Revenue agency will eventually deny the claim because you have what they call no reasonable expectations of profit. As far as the actual taxation there is no difference between Business profit or regular income it just gets added together and you get taxed on your total amount. Remember with self employment your are responsible for your CPP on total earnings under 42000 and there is no withholding tax so again you are responsible.

Just as you have to do everything your boss tells you, the person charged with watching overtime is being required to send out the e-mail at any time overtime is reached.  Don't worry over it.  It's just somebody doing the job they have been told to do.

Perhaps a severance is in order, with the understanding that they be a good reference for you?  You'd be surprised how many employers are willing to pay a little extra to get rid of some employees with a signed agreement.|`|qhENBYAHaa	If you are a union member you have the full rights under your contract and should have a union rep with you at the hearing.  If you are an independent contractor, your contract details your rights.  If you are like the rest of us you are an 'at will' employee and we have few rights.<br>  <br>  At at will employee can be terminated for any or no reason except for matters of discrimination.  Discrimination is based in law (see www.eeoc.gov) and currently is limited to age, sex, race, nationality, religion, disability, marital and military status.  <br>  <br>  Even with a doctor's note an at will employee can be terminated, as long as the employee is not considered "disabled" under the law.  To add to the issue of being at will, there is also the problem with being terminated for "absenteeism".  In all states people who are terminated for absenteeism usually cannot get unemployment benefits.  (people who quit their job also cannot get unemployment benefits)  The courts feel that the employer has a right to demand the employee be at work every day.<br>  <br>  So, you really do not want to be terminated, nor do you want to quit.  Some of the posters have suggested that you bring in doctor's documentation -- that may help, but that should have been sent to the employer already.  If your employer does not have this, it is important that you submit doctors information.  <br>  <br>  You may also want to discuss with your doctor if you can be considered legally disabled.  That would give you the protection of both state and federal laws.  Those who are disabled cannot legally be discrimianted against.  However, the limits of what is a disability and what the employer must do are iffy and you would need an attorney to help with this.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider getting a local employment attorney to attend the hearing with you.  Your employer may or may not allow you to bring a rep -- depends on your state laws.<br>  <br>  Finally you may want to go into this hearing saying you are sorry to have been off so much, that you know how this negatively impacts your co-workers and your boss, and beg (yes I said beg) for another chance.  From the employer's point of view your being absent is hurting them -- right or wrong the employer is more concerned with their own bottom line instead of your immune system.  If you admit that this behavior hurts the employer and even say you are sorry, that will go a lot further than arguing rights that you may not have.  The employer may put you on probation for a period of time just to see if you will show up at work everyday.<br>  <br>  This is not the economy to be out of work.  Sometimes we all have to eat a little crow just to keep our jobs.  Good luck.

OsKDNKTEaa	Hi Lance,<br>  This is a really tricky question with no simple answer. You do need to look at the long term implications of taking on an employee. What happens if the work slows down again - will you have to pay redundancy. What about holiday pay or sick pay? Will they work to your standards? How will they get themselves and the tools to your customers - their van or yours?<br>  <br>  How about looking for someone who will work on a freelance basis in the early days - you may only need them for a few hours a week at first. Or you give them more work to free you up to find new customers.<br>  <br>  If you do employ someone then the rate to the customer had to be high enough to pay their wages/costs and leave some profit for you. that is perhaps the deciding factor - is the profit on the extra work worth the risks with employing someone?

You also pay taxes on the distribution, and the amount depends on your income and deductions. Contributions to retirment plans receive favorable tax treatment because they are for your retirment.

Basically, the mgmt wants to know if the co-signer can afford payments if you break the lease.  I would ask the mgmt over the phone before I got too attached to a unit.  One thing in your favor could be employment history and the size of your income.

J7MTowtkaa	Most recruiting firms can not charge the candidates. They are hired by the companies to find the top talent they are seeking. Very often recruiters will call on people who are currently working to see if they are interested in a position at a company, which an in-house company recruiter generally would not do.  That is why they hire recruiters, to get access to talent they can't get to on their own.  <br>  <br>  They are paid a percentage commission based on your first year's salary, so the higher the salary they negotiate for you, the higher their commission.  Hence, their incentive to get you the best package they can.<br>  <br>  Recruiters are also great because they are the negotiating intermediary, so you don't have to do that awkward salary and benefits negotiation with the person who will then be your boss.<br>  <br>  They also have access to jobs you can't find on your own. Sometimes companies will only list open positions with recruiters to cut down on responses.  A recruiter will send them 3 qualified people to interview as opposed to them receiving hundreds of resumes that they then have to review to find the 3 qualified people.<br>  <br>  I've attached an article that outlines the best way to work with a recruiter. This happens to be a specific recruiter, but the info can go across the board with all of them.|`|ddVOwCJoaa	ysja hit most of the important points. Another reason companies hire recruiting firms is the position they are trying to fill is a niche position and candidates are hard to find.  Recruiters have better resources to source the qualified candidates.  <br>  <br>  Legitimate recruiting firms are paid by companies, not the candidate.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Usually, from my experience, the way it works is they have a contract with the company, the company hires them through the recruiter, and then the recruiter pays you.  They aren't bad, especially when the economy and times are as they are...usually if the company is stable they generally phase you into the company after 90 days or so...

Ja9DNpC6aa	So are interest rates really getting lower? Many potential homebuyers out there believe so, and are on the fence about purchasing a home because of it. <br>  <br>  They hear the media saying that rates may drop as low as 4.5%, and without a second thought, they believe it. How can we all better communicate the REAL truth about rates to our customers so they don’t sit on the fence until it’s too late?<br>  <br>  The Truth About Interest Rates:<br>  <br>  The Fed has been at it again, offering words that sound encouraging at first blush, confirming that their buying program of Mortgage Backed Securities is in full swing and will continue as needed. For those of you who don’t know, they are planning on buying a total of $500 Billion in MBS’s.<br>  <br>  Of course, the media will pick this up and offer their own interpretation, saying "Good news, the Fed's words on continuing their purchasing program means that rates will continue to drop lower, and remain low into the summer..." But is this what that really means? The answer is a resounding NO.<br>  <br>  Here’s the Truth.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Fed has been buying Mortgage Bonds, but if you look at what they are purchasing, they are buying a lot of FNMA and GNMA 30-yr 4.5% and 5.0% Bonds...which won't have much of an impact on present interest rates. <br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  To see the Fed's purchases for yourself, visit the following link:<br>  <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/mbs/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/mbs/in...</a><br>  <br>  So why is the Fed buying these Bonds?<br>  <br>  Well if you think about it, it's very smart of the Fed...and maybe even a little sneaky...because 4.5 and 5% Bonds actually represent outstanding mortgages with rates of 6 - 6.50%, which are precisely the loans being refinanced at today's great interest rates.<br>  <br>  With rates at present low levels, many of the mortgages in these FNMA 4.5 & 5% pools being bought up by the Fed will be refinanced and paid, thus giving the Fed a quick recoup on some of their investment. And this is likely a big reason why the Fed said they could continue this purchasing program beyond June, if necessary.<br>  <br>  The Fed buying these higher rate coupons will not necessarily help rates to move lower, as their actions do not impact the loans being originated at today's low rates.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|tdQTZPI7aa	The costs of doing business has increased plus the large number of defaulted loans makes it more expensive for everyone else|`|Qqz0H2hEaa	Interest rates are no longer standard like they were decades ago.  The interest rate you are offered would be different from the rate offered to me- based mostly on your credit score.  Investors change their internal risk rules also.  In the last week or two several huge investors have changed what types of income they will accept and what credit scores they will accept.  That could have been part of what you saw.<br>  <br>  Also my experience is that the recent fluctuations on thirty year fixed rates for excellent credit and large down payments have been between a low of about 5% and a high of about 6% with no points.  A couple of pints has recently bought down interest rates much more than normal also.<br>  <br>  Investors set their rates based on what they think inflation rates will be over the life of the loan.  If they think all this government spending will cause inflation to spin up and up three or four years from now- then they need to set a rate (that is fixed for thirty years!) that will give them a return they can live with.<br>  <br>  I think that in a couple of years we will be faced with inflation again, don't you?
d7bJIgqlaa	That is a really great question.  My first response would have been absolutely, but I guess I've never seen it written.  I have never been at a job that does not have open enrollment.  Here is the catch though (for the company)...the open enrollment period is also when people get off of the insurance as well as on it so, there would have to be a time or people would be starting and ending all the time!  If you are in the US call this number and just ask.  This is the Department of Labor.  They will be glad to tell you...it's why they exist.  <br>  <br>  1-866-487-2365|`|y2ZukikXaa	Yes, they have an open enrollment at every renewal of their plan which once a year.

It's actually cheaper.  You could even have your company "buyout" your remaining coverage if they would be willing, but it depends on your age and turnover at your company.  If you are very young, or they have a high turnover, they won't likely do it, but it would save them money to give you the money to buy several years of your own coverage.  You could also see if they would set up HRAs which is basically a health care allowance.  It's cheaper for the company and more cost effective for you.  I would look into the book The New Health Insurance Solutions by Paul Zane Pilzer.|`|m45R3s5Daa	be happy your both working and have insurance.<br>  im unemployed and have ****.
9k4d7Kytaa	So you're asking about life insurance?  If that's the case, then yes there can be two policies on the child.  The issue isn't with the number of policies as much as it's with the amount of death benefit on the kids life.  <br>  <br>  If the father has $100,000 on the kids life, then you apply for $100,000 on the kids life, the insurance company will question why you think your kid needs so much life insurance.  The child becomes an adverse risk.<br>  <br>  Now, you could always argue that you're merely trying to lock in some death benefit for the child to insure that he/she always has life insurance.  If you do this, it doesn't matter if your child get's cancer at 21 and can't buy any more life insurance because you've already bought a decent amount of insurance on him/her that can't be taken away as long as the premiums are paid.

These fees and regulations are often charged different depending on your country- or in the US by the State and City that the house is in.<br>  <br>  Your mortgage company will often estimate these very well for you because a large percentage of the costs have to do with creating the loan.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	In the USA this can cost between 5k to 7k.

If you are in charge of her estate, you should attach IRS Forms 56 and 1310 so that any refund can be sent to you.

My sister passed away in Dec 2006 and my oldest sister filed my sister final return, and claimed my sister children and some how her husband filed his tax return first and when my sister tax return was filed the children were already claimed, he is such as loser.  My oldest sister ended up having to pay IRS with my sister estate.  Well lets just say now her husband is very very broke, light turned off, bank account levied, the children choose to not speak to him.  My sister always said he would be hurting when she die and he is really suffering.  <br>  any way, file the tax return and will make your life easier, because IRS will send notices that a tax return was not filed, and then will file it for her and IRS files at a higher tax rate and always end up owing.
mWukMOAeaa	My first job was at a bakery. Yum!<br>  <br>  I like your idea of the library job. That's a very serene environment. Otherwise, try a receptionist job. That certainly involves computer work. By the way, KUDOS for you for wanting to work!! That's great that you are a motivated young person. I can tell you will do well in life. Just had to say that : )<br>  <br>  Does your family know anyone who owns a business that could use office help? Think about the people you and your family know. That kind of net working is very helpful in finding work. It's who you know a lot of times. But you can certainly look on craig'slist.org as well. They have something called summer jobs for teens. I know I saw it there when I was looking for work yesterday. It just might be worded differently. If that fails, which I doubt, type in your state and look under employment<br>  <br>  As for the income aspect, well minimum wage went up to $7.50 hrly. (or around there). Depends on how many hours your job allows you and if there is overtime- which is working over 40 hours a week. <br>  <br>  Retail stores may have you doing a number of things like running a register which is all computerized and easy, using a pricing gun to mark items- I'm sure you've walked passed a person doing that before. You can put out new inventory. You'd be opening boxes (sometimes they have a specific person do that) or taking the new merchandise out to the floor to be hung. You'd be doing customer service is what a retail job is about and it's great experience for a young person. I've done it and loved it. You have to have patience though. Some people just have a bad day and can be mean. Never take anything personal when it comes to strangers treating you badly. You will find this in any job you do and it will probably not be your fault.<br>  <br>  If you have a hard time finding work because of our countries economy you can put out an ad for something like dog walking, house sitting (for when people go on vacation). Try also shopping for the elderly. They love young people! Make sure you ask around though. It's tough out there. I wish you the very best!!!

The problem lies in the fact that most underwriting for home equity lines of credit and first mortgages, requires the same income verification that a purchase mortgage would require.<br>  <br>  Since you are in the very fortunate position of having your current home paid off, do not be afraid to sell it.  Remember, when we are in a tough seller's market, it does not materially affect you in your net worth because if you are moving within the same town it will be a lateral move.<br>  <br>  For instance, you are a seller which puts you in a less fortunate position than a buyer.  So you may have to take less for your current house than when it was in a booming real estate market.  However, let's look at it this way.  You will be buying a house, won't you?  So you will have an advantage in negotiating the best price on the house that you purchase.<br>  <br>  Use the proceeds from the house that you sell and couple it with the $40,000 in mortgage proceeds that you are approved for and go shopping.  Just be sure that you have a lot of reserve funds set aside in cash so that you can ride out your turbulent job situation should you become unemployed after buying your next house.  But I highly doubt that a $40,000 mortgage liability will stretch yourself too thin.  You seem to be a very financially astute person for having your current house paid off for ten years, that it awesome!|`|8KRdkE3baa	DO YOU NEED A LOAN?<br>  <br>  Please Serious Seeking Interested Persons Only in dire Need of this loan or<br>  Mortgage either for Personal or Business or Even Rehabbing.Keep in touch.Un<br>  serious Persons will have their Offers Turned down,when applying for a<br>  loan,please be Ensure that you come alongside with your Full names and<br>  address.Once again you have to be In dire Need of the loan so as not to get<br>  your Offer.

Once there, you need to obtain a Letter of Intent from your future employer stating (on company letterhead), your job title, start date, job duties, and your pay/salary/wage. <br>  <br>  That way you won't have to worry about averaging out previous jobs, as you could use the expected future income.  But, if the new job is in a new line of work, you'll have to keep that job for 2 years before you can obtain a mortgage.  I hope this helps!

y4SUDnpaaa	Don't do anything with your 401K until it's the only choice available. You can also take out a loan against your 401K, that would be better than liquidating it. Also, do you have a life insurance policy, if you do you make a loan against it. There is no interest on repayment and you don't have to pay in back at once. If you never pay it back the only thing that will happen is that they will deduct the amount  you borrowed when the policy is used.......you wouldn't be around to worry about it.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	You can't "cash out" a 401k.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	The IRS may get more than you do.<br>  <br>  Check out the tax and penalties first.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	that would be a very bad idea.  It can be done but it would be at a huge tax penalty.  Also if you are like everyone else your 401k has dropped in value a lot and would be best left for it's intended purpose of retirement so that it has time to recover from the economy.|`|XZG35fxSaa	If you absolutely need the money, you can withdraw it, but you'll have to pay tax plus 10% penalty on it next year.  You can ask them not to withhold taxes if you need all of the money up-front. Otherwise, you can roll it over to a new IRA, and not owe anything.|`|JQZzI49Paa	If you can't transfet it, then you may want to cash it in, and put it away for and emergency|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	I've taken a hit on mine recently as well but I won't retire until 2042 so leaving it in is the best thing to do for me. I think leaving it in there would be the best thing for you to do as well. <br>  <br>  If you're hellbent on taking it out, it should be a last resort. A cash out of your 401k will cost you 25-35% in federal and state taxes AND then a 10% penalty. Let alone, what you do a cash out of your 401k could be possibly 5x-10x that amount in lost retirement money.<br>  <br>  It is not a good idea. Hang in there if you've got the time and things will get better.  I hope you have luck finding another job soon.|`|4ooXYuYFaa	No. Absolutely not until you have no other alternative. Chances are, your investments are down about 40% right now as it is. If you cash it out, the fund manager will automatically withhold 20% and then next year you will be responsible for paying income taxes and a 10% penalty for early withdrawal. <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario, do a direct rollover to an IRA. Then, you can at least withdraw a little bit of money if you need to and you will have the option to not have the 20% in federal taxes withheld. (You will still have to pay taxes on it, but not until next year at tax time). <br>  <br>  Depending on how much and what share are in your 401k, you could be sacrificing huge returns in the future for retirement. There are some good online calculators that can demonstrate how much money will will lose over the next 40 years if you cash it out now. <br>  <br>  Hold on for as long as you can! I too am 31 and left my job in January. Haven't had to touch anything yet...but it sure is tempting!|`|kPKKyZluaa	I would wait to see if I can get into another job or get unemployment before cashing a 401k|`|4d1d61e8ee76ab95bb8d2c7a9badfe1daa	your 401 k is not cash able - may involve heavy penalties.|`|koymw0cZaa	Please save your money and try to find another job|`|osj6pGzJaa	If you can get away with NOT doing that, try to hold out and see if you can pick up another job first.|`|YrrFIoEiaa	Go to CNN News   Watch  Suzie   She vary good on that Are look up cnn online

nYnZr8AMaa	You should speak to the company's payroll department to find out why they issued you a T5 slip.  T5 slips are to report dividends or interest paid.  As an employee you would not normally receive either of these unless you owned shares in the corporation or lent money to them.  <br>  <br>  If it was indeed a mistake, then you should ask the employer to cancel the T5.  If they won't do this then you should call Canada Revenue at 1-800-959-8281 and ask them for advice on how to proceed.

Therefore<br>  they want you to sign on the dotted line.<br>  Go back to the agency that has your contract and tell them<br>  what was suggested to you.  They can submit you for the<br>  other opening also.  You don't need to pay 2 commissions.|`|AA10892706	As a job seeker, you should not be locked into any contract. If you go to register with Firm B, they will not submit you to the same company - that's just not good business practice in the industry. Also, since you were not chosen after your first interview, HR depts. sometimes get a little "funny" if another firm sends in the same person to interview. <br>  <br>  You have no obligation to any firms. You can register with all of them if you'd like. That will certainly increase your chances of finding what you want.<br>  <br>  It's hard to explain why it's not good business practice, but if the company had other openings you felt qualified for, they would've recognized that and brought you back in. Sorry, I don't mean to bring you down - just remember you can go to other firms. If you really would like to, go ahead and go to the other firms and ask to be submitted to the company.
psiHn55vaa	Ray,<br>  <br>  It is very common to have multiple interviews for a management position. You will be working with lots of different personalities in a retail environment and it is part of the screening process. How well you respond and interact will determine your success. Be calm, confident and honest and you will do your best.<br>  <br>  They may be trying to find the best fit for you at a Walgreen's store. There are tons of candidates right now and they want to make sure they make the best decision for them.  How long this process takes is up to the employer and their sense of urgency. <br>  <br>  A good question to ask at the end of the interview with the District Manager would be: <br>       When do you plan to make a Hiring decision? <br>  Some other key questions are: <br>     Based on our interview today, how do you see my skills fitting into the Walgreen's Management position?  Is there anything that would prevent me from being the best candidate for this job? <br>  <br>  No, everyone who applies does not make it to an interview. It just depends on their HR practices - some have minimum number of candidates they have to interview, some only promote from within, and  just have to screen outside candidates to meet their numbers. Don't worry about that and just focus on your preparation for the interviews - know about Walgreen's - research all news about them, find out what you can about the District Manager, be able to articulate your strengths, practice the tough questions.  Good luck!|`|KF5pitm8aa	Walgreens is the fastest growing drugstore chain in the United States. I have no doubt that it will take over Rite Aid within the next 5 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have an interview with the District Manager, you are pretty much already in the club. <br>  <br>  The reason why you had to do two interviews with different store managers is because if you get the job, you will have to work closely with other managers in your district. They want to make sure that you are motivated, reliable, and basically just have a good head on your shoulders.<br>  <br>  After your interview with the DM, there is no shame in asking when he will have made a hiring decision. It makes it sound like you are eager for the job, and that you possibly have other offers on the table (even if you don't). <br>  Remember to send him a thank-you note, along with the other two managers who interviewed you. It may sound a little corny and girl-ish, but it is a small gesture that goes a long way. No need for a novel, just say that you enjoyed meeting them, thank them for their time, and that you hope you will be allowed the opportunity to join the company and work with them.<br>  <br>  You are right, the time of managers and especially the DM is very valuable. They would not waste their time if they did not think you were the right person for the job. If they thought that, you would be done after the first interview.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA10368727	President Obama claims that if you make less than $250K per year, your taxes will not increase at all, once the Tax Cuts extended under the Bush Administration are allowed to expire.<br>  <br>  This is because his intention is to have congress extend (or make permanent) some of the tax cuts.  He's actually borrowing a strategy that was successfully used by the Bush Administration back in the days before the Iraq war, which generated 80% approval ratings for Bush.  That tactic was to enact a tax cut, and then immediately direct the IRS to inform employers to start withholding less money, which put more cash in the pockets of working Americans.<br>  <br>  President Obama knows, as did Bush, that this is a particularly effective strategy.  And so, enjoy your $60 per month extra cash starting in April.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Congratulations are being financially enough to pick up on that.<br>  To meet the spending this new budget entails taxing the rich will not be enough.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	he has said they are going away. he will increase taxes on people making over 200,000 a yr to pay for health care.|`|snh9wzpnaa	Sure it would, if he reversed all of Bush's cuts.  Bush's cuts lowered taxes for anybody making at least $6000 ($12000 joint couple).  But he may not reverse all of them.  After all the so called "stimulus" made the federal handouts for the Earned Income Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit much much more lucrative for people who make $3000 to $15000.<br>  <br>  But I think everybody has seen through the election campaign BS of only squeezing people over $250K for more money.  That just doesn't raise enough money because that is only 2% of taxpayers even though they already pay 50% of all income taxes.|`|AA11132354	NOPE.<br>  Bush's tax cuts were for those at the top.  Under Bush, the middle class has been disappearing.  Look at the statistics.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	There are no plans to reverse the cuts.  They were only temporary.|`|AA10318922	Nope.  Most of the Bush tax cuts didn't do anything for low-income people, so eliminating them won't hurt low-income people.<br>  <br>  For example, who benefits from the lower capital gains tax rates?  Know any Wal-Mart employees with huge stock portfolios?<br>  <br>  How about increased Section 179 deductions for equipment purchases?  That helps the larger "small" businesses, not the mom & pop store or the Wal-Mart employee.<br>  <br>  That was the big myth of the Bush tax cuts-- they didn't do much for most of us.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the cruelest tax on the low-incomers is inflation, which is caused by excessive deficit spending, and Bush set a record for that, doubling our national debt to over $10 trillion.  He made LBJ look like a spendthrift.
