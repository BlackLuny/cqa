20090222191909AAkRO4T	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are the chances? pure coincidence?	my husband just moved to our new home a month or so ago.  we were at the pet store, and there was a woman in front of us checking out and she had her dog with her, i believe it was a lapso apso (spelling) it was so cute, white with big dark eyes and super sweet.  this pet store we went to was about 10 miles away we only went there because we were in the area after eating dinner.  so we buy the dog food, make a stop at the supermarket and come home.  we pull in the driveway and he comes a neighbor we dont know and never saw walking down the street with a white lapso apso on a leach, my hub goes look, that looks like the same dog!  so the dog runs near us to get petted and i go to the owner wow we just saw a dog just like this at pet smart...as i looked it was the same dog with the same collar and leash and the neighbor goes no way my wife just got home from pet smart, which one did you 2 go to so we told him, he said his wife was at the same one with the dog.......      weird huh, whats the chances that you are 10-12 miles away and see a dog in a pet store, only to turn around and find out that dog lives a few doors down from you lolllllllllll      things like this happen to me and my hub all the time
20090222192016AAWlCc4	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Would she like this letter?	I really like this girl at youth group and I’m almost certain that she likes me as well. We have exchanged countless e-mails just talking about everyday stuff but we have never talked about our “relationshipial type problems/ statuses “ I think I’m about reedy to just tell her how I feel. She said something the other day about how she feels sorry for all the letters that have never been written, in reference to a conversation about how people hardly ever send actual letters anymore, so I thought I would handwrite a letter and send it to her telling her how I feel. Anyway this is what I’ve got so far; tell me if it’s any good? I tried writing it in a way that told her exactly how I felt about her, but also in a way where she can choose what she truly wants and also I didn’t want there to be any pressure on her part.

20090222192324AADvbog	Society & Culture;Community Service	In Baltimore, what is this hand signaling?	This morning, my husband and I were driving through the "rougher" parts of Baltimore.  We saw several people stick their hand out in front or to their side (aimed toward the road as we drove past) and start waving it up and down.  My husband noticed one individual do it until he spotted a cop and then quickly disappeared.  Is this an indication of some sort of illegal activity? (I have my suspicions, but do not want to infer the worst.)  I found it to be strange behavior and quite alarming (if it turns out to be what I think it is - due to the sheer number of citizens doing it).

20090222192644AAiNZIi	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why do people get angry when they get a dose of their own medicine?	If someone treats you a certain way consistently over a period of time and you get fed up and decide to give them a dose of their own medicine, why do they get angry?   I used to work with someone who would always make fun of the way I did my work and she would always make subtle insults, but when I finally said something mean to her, she was EXTREMELY angry.  I tried to work out the issues that I was having with her by having a meeting with her, face to face, in front of the manager.  But she would not see things from my perspective.  She even had the audacity to start referring to me as "That One" whenever there was something I needed to know.  She would refer to me as "That one" to another coworker and have that coworker pass along the information to me.  I tried to ignore it but off course it pissed me off.   This whole thing still makes my blood boil, to be degraded in that way by someone who consistently made me feel bad before i ever said anything mean to her.  Have you ever been in a similar situation and how did you handle it?

My husband often chides me for not going to church and tells me how much he is learning at these classes. I don't like church for the way it's such a political organization - with cliques and sub rosa fighting, all of which doesn't bother him. But the worst of it is that I don't feel moved to do what he's doing when I have to live with his unkind behavior toward me and our children. He is not willing to listen when we tell him how we feel about his actions and speech. How is that a good Christian ideal?

The pleasure is permanent; whereas, hitting someone is just a temporary fix that only makes the situation more worse than it is.

20090222173426AA0vuLI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Have you ever thought about cutting/suicide before?	I remember a night back in October 08. I was on the phone all night with Nate. Things were up and down, and at the time, down. I told him that I would cut his name in my arm to prove to him that I loved him. And I did just that. And he wouldn't believe me. So I took a picture with my phone and texted him that picture. :'( I can still see a faint "NATE" on my left arm, just above my wrist.       Suicides always on my mind, intentional or not. I'm not going there. :/      *hugs*      Oh, and I don't cut anymore... Actually, that was the only time I've ever cut.

20090222175157AAzM73i	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Sharing my diary? my question is too short so blahblahblah :p?	would any of you (if they kept one) share a diary with someone?   as in, you write it and let them read it.      the reason i ask is that me and my boyfriend have had a few arguments recently, during which i tend to either not say anything and shut down or go absolutely mental. ??. hmm. he thinks i should try to open up to him more - and i agree. the only problem is im kinda a shy person when it comes to having boyfriends and girlfriends so it's hard to tell him things about my past. i think if he read my diary, he'd see that i'm willing to open up to him, and he'd understand why i act like i do in some situations.      do you think i should let him read it? i'm going round his tomorow to try and make up, ive asked him if he would want to read it and he said if i'm comfortable with it which i sorta am, well more comfortable than if i spoke this stuff and i DO want him to know BUT      there's things in there like "oh my god the cutest girl in the world said hi to me on the bus today" and other silly stuff like that, and also stuff i wrote when i was trying to imitate kurt cobain (anyone who's read his journal will know what i mean :p) and be all deep and failed miserably which might be a bit cringeworthy if he reads.      so would you let your partner read your diary to prove that you trusted them/wanteed to be open to them? if yes, then why, and if no, then why not, and what would you do instead?      thanks sorry if its long :p      ohh, and i know this isn't strictly an LGBT question, but i think the people here are nicer :)      thanks again

Why did God play favorites and choose Europe, Africa, and Asia to preach his teachings and leave out North and South America.  I know that some of you will say that he left it for his followers to spread the good news to the rest of the world when they found it.  He should have had a better plan because the white man's arrival in the America's was the worst thing to happen to Native Americans.

Problem is: what to do? How do I volunteer? I mean by, I don't want to do another bake sale. Do you think the school will permit me to have a club or something? How do I contact a animal shelter for example and do you think they will say yes? I'm up for anything. It doesn't have to be just animals and such. Anything would do good.

20090222173711AAKFBb2	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	Should we move to Florida from the Midwest?	Asking senior citizens as we value your wisdom and also you may have already faced such a move in your life.  I would really like people who currently live in Florida to answer please so I can get a "local's" perspective.  My husband and I are both college graduates. Though we make mortgage payments, even with the current economy, we could sell our home for more than what we paid and end up with a profit.  My husband and I feel we could both get decent jobs in Florida and one of us would probably move first and rent until the house sells or until the other one of us gets a job there also. I work in healthcare.  Also with the prices of homes right now in Florida, we would then be able to pay cash and outright own the home we buy in Florida. And, we would not have any other debt.  We do not have any family here where we currently live nor do we have family in Florida, but we do have friends who live there and we vacation there often.  We are so tired of the cold, and we also believe it would be a healthier lifestyle for us.  Is there any reason anyone can think of why we shouldn't move? Even with not having debts and if our house in FL was totally paid for, should the economy be a concern? Thank you in advance for responses--making a big move is always nerve-wracking, but that's why we would try to do it in steps.

Why can't you understand that it is you and only you making these bad decisions.  No influence necessary.           It must also be true then that every good decision you make is influenced by god or an angel.  Why can't you take responsibility for your actions including tempting yourself, instead of blaming some other improbable demon or angel.

But when jeff showed us the bump in his pants he asked bob to show his and bob said no you would think it was feeky. So i think he was not turned on by it. Later we all went to jeffs house. At After A while jeff wanted to play truth or dare. The dare for bob was to sit in my lap with his butt showing (witch he did like 10 times) and hold my hand. Now i could tell that bob was enjoying him self. But jeff was laughing his *** off and calling it rape. After a while bob went all out h started jumping on me and other stuff. So when i got hard he saw and started to laugh. HOWEVER when he reached down it was only my cell phone.        I went over to bobs house ALONE yesterday. He did his usual and rubbed my leg, held my hand, sat in my lap (after he did all of these he said he was kidding but i could see he liked it) After a while he told me what jeff is planing to do. Tomorrow at lunch he is going to tell everyone that I RAPED THEM. when i all i did was just sit there. Bob asked jeff not to talk at all about what he did and much less the LIE he will make up about me. I want to keep jeff as a friend but i don't want him to keep doing this. I know all he means is too have fun but i know if i tell him the way i usually do he will say that im gay and defending my self so what should i do            Thanks for reading that

20090222180513AApScXF	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How do you deal with being gay?	So I'm gay...       I tried to like girls for years: I can't. I can see a girl or think about one and the result is nothing. A hot, caring guy however, well....      I feel very alone and unable to relate to anyone. My sister found out and threatened to blackmail me by telling my parents (very against gays) if I didn't do what she said. I have no friends, or rather very few that are some distance away from me, so I effectively am isolated. I talk to one girl on the internet in Canada and we are best girlfriends. I love hearing about her boyfriends and being there for her. I hide it well, but I am very much the semi sterotypical gay guy... Practical circumstances make it so I cannot come out yet.       With (perhaps more than) enough backstory, how do you deal with being gay and feeling different? I don't relate well to other men; I get along better with women in casual conversation. However, I never let anyone get close to me and am afraid to make friends. I am seeing a counselor and on anti anxiety medication. I finally told her i am gay.   She keeps trying to gently nudge me towards doing something social but I'm always scared to.       How do I relate to other people as a gay guy without coming out (because I can't at the moment).       All grumblings aside... I'm just trying to figure things out here... Any advice? How did you do it?

20090222183257AA7IxOq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist Challenge: Question no Atheist can answer...?	Since you guys believe nothing can just 'be' into existence from nowhere and nothing...      Where did our entire universe, planets, stars, sun, moon, galaxies... come from? Since everything had to come from somewhere, where did they come from?      If you guys love Science as much as you say you do... you should obviously believe in the Big Bang (which I, as a Muslim, believe in as well- it's in the Quran)...      BUT, since you think nothing could pop out of nothingness... where did the Big Bang come from? That primary nebula... where did that come from?... Surely, everything had to come from somewhere... so WHERE id it come from?      You might respond by asking me where God came from, or responding by saying 'we don't have all the answers'... or by saying 'we don't know yet'... but do any of you genius, super IQ'd scientist Atheists... have an answer for that?      May Allah guide you...

If being gay is just like any other popular sin -- gambling, drinking/drugs, gluttony, pride, etc. -- why does god spend so much of his time trying to quash the GLBT movement while ignoring the other big sins?

Why would any person make the choice to be part of a minority that:      is currently seen (at least legally) as second class citizens   is frequently the victim of hate crimes   is seen as an "abomination" by the majority of the country      Do you think they just really like anal sex?  Because instead of going through all the hardships that they do just live their lifestyle, they could just as easily do that with a woman (both ways after a trip to any sex shop in the country).      So, remembering that people usually tend to act in their own best interests, why would anyone deliberately live a lifestyle that puts them in this position?

Another surah says 2 womens court testemony will equal one man. I wonder how the national organization for women would react if a Senator would ever introduce a law that says 2 women = one man.       Muhammad said in one of the hadiths that a nation lead by a woman couldn't succeed. And what is up with a woman cant go out without a Mahram escort.    How does that liberate women?

20090222183555AAo0tqI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Complicated Living Arrangements?	I dated my ex for almost a year.  Some of that time was long distance.  When she moved back to my city, she moved in with me in my 1 bd/1bth apartment.  Shortly after she moved back, I broke up with her (call me a b*tch, I know.) Things just weren't going right and my feelings had changed.      We have a very amicable relationship and have been sharing the bed in the bedroom (just for sleeping!).  Recently, she has started seeing a new girl.  That girl has spent the night over a few times (they've slept on the futon in the living room).        I think this new girl is an absolute doll.  She's super friendly and I enjoy chilling with them.  I'm happy that my ex has found someone that makes her happy.  However, I'm feeling a little out of sorts.        I feel odd walking out to the kitchen in the mornings with them sleeping/cuddly in the living room.  I feel like I'm disturbing them and slightly invading their privacy.  Plus, then I'm in their way while I'm eating breakfast and whatnot.      I don't want to get in the way of what they're doing, you know.  My ex says its no big deal and that I'm feeling weird for no reason.  I think that if I were the new girl, I'd feel very awkward about the situation.      So help!  Either tell me to get over myself or give me some ideas about how we can all three live in harmony.      [Additional information: the new girl doesn't have a place of her own that would allow my ex to stay the night with her]      Thanks!

20090222182642AALHvwW	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why r a lot of PETA supporters pro-choice when it comes 2 abortion when they r against any killing of animal?	The killing of both animals and people should be important to PETA people.  I think it is wrong to put the life of an animal before the life of a human being and a woman who is pregnant has a life in her even if it is only a single-celled organism or an embryo or a fetus.  So it is wrong to say that it is alright for a woman to have an abortion which is a procedure that kills the embryo or celled-organism inside the woman's womb which means that you are destroying a life because we all started as one-celled organisms and then grew to an embryo and then a fetus or something like that.       All life should be respected by people who fight to protect the lives of animals.      If you don't want an animal to die then why would you support a woman's right to have an abortion?

20090222183927AATC7Zz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the purpose of the law, is it to increase sin?	Could it be that the mere mention of something, increases our knowledge, curiosity, and desire to do said thing? Could it have been God's intention for Adam and Eve to eat the fruit, by telling them not to? But why, if that's true, would God want us to do the very thing He says not to? Would it be to increase our desire and need for grace?      And the law came in addition, to make wrongdoing worse; but where there was much sin, there was much more grace. (Rom 5:20, Basic English Translation)      But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead. (Rom 7:8, Basic English Translation)

Also, some examples of these logical and reasonable explanations are evolution, abiogenesis, the big bang etc. These are all scientific theories and if you don't truly and fully understand what that means or are uneducated on the aforementioned topics then i suggest you educate yourself.

20090222201121AAsG1wh	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why are people so bad at parenting now, no one disciplines their child about inappropriate behaviour in public?	I don't get it as the parents of these badly behaved kids must have been disciplined by their parents as that's the way it was in the past.  So why are they so scared to give their kids a good telling off when it's warranted.  Seriously, they do seem scared of their kid becoming emotionally upset or not liking them.  Examples being:  I know it's not parents but a school group at an observation tower I was at recently where me & the other members of the public were enjoying this fantastic view of the city, then the school group arrives - the kids were about 10 so should have known better - they ran around, tried to break the binoculars there for the public to use, yelled all over the place.  Their teachers said & did nothing about it & let them run riot.  The people running the observation tower ignored them also even though myself & all the other adults there were glaring at the kids & their teachers.  When I was at school we would have gotten a little pep talk from our teachers before going to something like that - we'd be told you're representing your school so behave & don't make noise, etc.  If we did misbehave we would be told off.      The next day I was on a plane & the maybe 8 to 10 year old kid behind me kicked & punched the back of my seat the whole time.  I glared at his parents & they looked embarrased, yet failed to tell him off.  He then stood up on the seat in his shoes & yelled out stuff.  The parents & airline staff did nothing, even though me & the other passengers were looking on, appalled.  He was way too old to be behaving like that.      If you go to the movies & parents are there with their kids they let their kids talk loudly throughout the whole film & if you say something they say, he's just a kid, etc.  But they always look embarrassed & don't know what to say when I ask them, so when you were his age you did that at the movies?  Obviously not, so why won't they tell their kid to shut up?  I'm tired of asking people to tell their kids how to behave.      The worst is when you're in the changing rooms of clothing stores & an unsupervised kid comes & opens the curtains while you're getting changed, exposing you naked to the whole store!!!

Anabolic Steroids   Anabolic Steroids are powerful drugs that help the body gain mass, but also hurts the body with drastic side effects. Anabolic Steroids are a type of natural and synthetic hormone that stimulates cell growth and division, resulting in an increase of muscle tissue and strength. The growth only occurs when combined with physical training (Wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids).   Anabolic Steroids may help you gain muscle mass, but with a high price. Steroids have noticeable side effects including acne and scars, an increased sex drive, increased hair growth in Androgen-Sensitive areas, deepened voice along with an increased vocal cord size, more or bigger muscles, a larger appetite, bone remodeling, increased production of Red Blood Cells, liver damage, headaches, irritability, trouble sleeping, and jaundice (Santella 613.8). In Males, the penis may decrease or increase in size, breasts can be developed, premature balding, and testicular pain. In Females, development of man-like features may occur (Santella 613.8).   There are many different types of Anabolic Steroids, but mostly there are oral anabolic steroids and intravenous steroids (Santella 613.8). Oral Steroids are usually pills that one would take through the mouth. Intravenous Steroids are injected into the body (Santella 613.8). Some different types of Oral Anabolic Steroids are Anadrol, Anavar, Dianabol, Maxibolin, Methyltestosterone, Primobolin, and Winstrol (Santella 613.8). Types of Intravenous Steroids include Triamcinilone, Betamethasone, and Prednisone (Santella 613.8).   Teenagers are often users of Anabolic Steroids. Teens often acquire Anabolic Steroids from dealers at school, the Internet, or some types are even sold over the counter at local health stores. For that reason, a large amount of teenagers have access to the drug for their use. As for the reason teens use steroids, those who have admitted to taking them have said they used them to be better at sports, "fit in" or "be sexy" (Santella 613.8). Statistically, Male teens are more prone to use anabolic steroids than female teens, because males are more likely to try to get an advantage in sports. About 14% of athletes in the 12th grade were found to be using steroids, and about 13.3% of 10th grade were found to be using steroids (Santella 613.8).   Teens have even made up their own slang terms for Anabolic Steroids. Some of these names include "juice", "gum", "candy", "pumpers", and "pops".    "Arnolds", and "Stackers". Such slang terms can be used as "code names" in order to keep them secret from adults or authorities (Santella 613.8).    In the United States, Anabolic Steroids are illegal. The first time a person in the U.S. is caught using steroids, they may get up to ten years in prison, up to a $15,000 fine, and a two year probation period. The second time a person is caught using or selling steroids there is a maximum fine of $30,000, up to two years of probation, and possibly ten years in prison (Monroe 613.8). In Canada and Australia, Anabolic Steroids are not illegal, but are highly discouraged. (Rogak 613.8)   Athletic Associations have taken the subject of Anabolic Steroid use very seriously. Major League Baseball currently enforces a strict code against the use of steroids. For a first positive steroid test, the player caught using the drug is suspended for ten games. For a second positive steroid test, the player caught using the drug is suspended for 100 games. Finally, for a third positive test, the player caught using steroids is given a lifetime ban from baseball. (Espn.com/news)   The National Football League currently enforces rules against steroids that for a positive test, the player caught using the steroids could be suspended for four games (wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Le...    The National Collegiate Athletic Association also enforces strict rules against the use of steroids including being suspended from college sports to even being permanently banned. (wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_...   The Olympics currently enforce the harshest penalties of all of the Steroid restrictions. Steroid usage currently could earn the athlete caught using Steroids a lifetime ban and up to $100,000 fine for a minor infraction, and up to a $1,000,000 fine for serious breaches of the rules. (sportsillustrated.cnn.com)   Anabolic Steroids were invented accidentally in the 1930s by a team of German scientists, but the drugs were not deemed significant enough for any further study. The first known reference to Anabolic Steroids in a United States weightlifting magazine was in a letter to the editor of the magazine Strength and Health. In the 1950s, scientists of the Food and Drug Administration approved the steroid called methandrostelone in the United States. (wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids)   In the 1990s counterfeit drugs became easier to detect using new technology. In 1991, the U.S. Congress passed the Controlled Substances Ac

Political Correctness (PC) is the communal tyranny that erupted in the 1980s. It was a spontaneous declaration that particular ideas, expressions and behaviour, which were then legal, should be forbidden by law, and people who transgressed should be punished. (see Newspeak) It started with a few voices but grew in popularity until it became unwritten and written law within the community. With those who were publicly declared as being not politically correct becoming the object of persecution by the mob, if not prosecution by the state.    http://www.ourcivilisation.com/pc.htm

Do you think they have more of the "holy spirit" in them? But if that were true, then there wouldn't be 10,000 christian denominations, would there? I mean, if these preachers were that much better able to understand the bible's message, then there should be no dissension.      So what good is the "holy spirit" when interpreting the bible? If that meant anything at all, you'd all agree. So having said that, that would make an atheist's (or Buddhists, or Muslims, etc) interpretation of the bible just as valid as yours or your priests, no?      I did ask this earlier, but, oddly enough, had very few christian answers.

20090222194725AAanU9c	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Am I justified to kick out my housemate?	I went interstate for the weekend and checked with my housemate that it was ok that she fed my cat she said it was ok, but when i got back she had no food or water, my housemate said she filled them up but I left a big bowl of water and I know my cat wouldn't drink that amount in 24 hours (which is the time she claimed to have filled it).  When I was away the cat did a number 2 in my bedroom which is annoying because she has a litter but there was obviously too much poop in it so she went elsewhere.  My housemate refuses to pick it up and said that she had to stay at her boyfriend's house all weekend because the smell was so bad and it's my fault.  I really don't see why it's so hard to pick it up if it's really that annoying...      Also, I have done her dishes many times and I left a few cups and she didn't think she should have to do them which I think is quite unfair.      The house is owned by my parents and uncles (joint ownership) so I guess if I wanted her to leave I would have authority, is this worth asking her to leave over?  We have talked about it and she got really upset and yelled at me and cried so it didn't really help...      The reason I did get a housemate was mainly for company so I wasn't alone, but more than half the time she spends the night at her boyfriend's and when he comes to our place they just spend all the time in her bedroom with the door shut so it's not much company.  Am I in my right to ask her to leave and find a more suitable housemate?  We have been friends for a while so I don't want to ruin the friendship, but it might be too late for that anyway.

Should I go back to Australia?	**** THANKS FOR SPENDING A FEW MINUTES TO READ MY QUESTION. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP AND APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE **********      I am 23, male. I have been studied science in an Australian university for 1 year. My parents want me to be a biological scientist but I am not interested in science at all. I didn't do well and finaIly I droped out from the course :( . My university counsellor suggest me to go back to Hong Kong (my hometown) and discover my own interest before I go back to study in Australia. Back in Hong Kong, I am living with my parents and I share the rent with them. The rent is about US$ 900 per month. Dad, mum and I pay US$300 each. My 20-year-old younger sister lives with us as well.However, she doen't pay anything.      Recently all my family members suspect I am gay. They ask , " I'm sure that you drop out from your science course because you are homosexual. Ewww! Everyday they say unplesant things to me ( e.g. I hate you so much, I'll never forgive you, You should turn back to heterosexual, I wanna beat you up because you are gay, All gay men are worse than sh*t, including you ) I face their bad words everyday in addition to having an academic failure, I went back to my room and closed the door and cried. Then sister say I am not allowed to close my room's door. " You need to have your room door opened all the time, including when you are crying. What's the point of closing the d*mn door? Have you ever considered my feelings?You know what? I have been tolerated your gayness for a while!" My parents are always on her side. They say" Listen to *your sister, you f*ggot" My parents also say " Why can't you get along with us well? If you can't get along with us well, it means you can't get along with your schoolmates and colleagues as well. You are a big loser !" My sister, who is studying to be a counsellor, says " Why are you so defensive about yourself? Why don't you loosen up yourself and date women?   " I replied "I have tried to date a girl for 3 months. But finally I've found that it doesn't work. I don't want to cheat the girl and say "I am straight" anymore. I don't want to hurt the girl. We broke up. " I added " I am proud of being gay". My sister replied , " You're so defensive about your homosexuality therefore no counsellor on Earth can help you. "       I also said , " I dropped out from science course because I have no interest in it at all. Mum, My dream is to be an successful accountant, not a scientist ."      Question 1) Which one do you think is better? Get my accounting degree in Australia or stay in Hong Kong ? You are 23 year old laready. My mum said " If you study full-time in Australia for 3 more years , it mean you will lose 3 years of work experience. When you graduate with an accounting degree at the age of 26, no one will hire you again because you are too old at that time. You will not able to find a good job because employers tend to employ younger people. However, I really wanna go to Australia , do my favourite course and stay away my parents. Will I be less competitive in the job market after 3 years ( graduation at the aged of 26) ?      Quetion 2) How do you think of my parents and sisters?      Question 3) I saved a bit money and I enrol in a DJing short course in a musical school. Because I really wanna try DJing. Well, DJing in Clubs/pubs. I wanna to be a part-time DJ. However, my mum say I've made a stupid mistake. She said , " The club DJ working environment is too bad. You can find drugs, prostitute, pimp and manwh0re there. You don't love yourself based on your decision to learn DJing. Someone in pub will put drugs into your pocket and you'll be prosecuted. " I learn it because I am interested"  I said. "You lack of critical thinking since you enrol in that course. You can't earn much money for DJing. Loser! I My mum says I am stupid and she is clever. How do you think ?          Question 4) My mum says I need to accompany her all the time when she needs to dine out. "If you treasure our mother-son relationship, then you must dine out with me. Otherwise, it means you think I am not important in your life. Even you have to work part-time, get a sick-leave and accompany me.I will turn you straight " I refused and she said "F**k off, loser! " I feel that I am a slave. Do I normal to feel this way?      Question 5) Am I suffering from depression now? Since my family gay-bashes me, I have never had good sleep at night. I have also lost my appetite. I always feel anxious when seeing my family members everyday. I even lose interest in collecting stamps( my hobbies) in my spare time.       Question 6) My family suggest me to do my accountant course in Hong Kong and live with them. "Even though you are able to financially support yourself in Australia, you should live with us and learn how to get along with us well." I really wanna cried again! Can you give me suggestions?

20090222195240AAm1hrp	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Lumping: Races of Blacks & Whites?	I am white with other races and I feel that if I use the term "black" that I will be construed as racist. I am not racist in the slightest & do not condone racism. I cannot speak for my whole race, nor can any other person. The term "white" or "black" or "yellow" or "pink" is a definition of a whole, as no one knows every single person in that race. What should I use to voice my opinion in this matter? Why is it ok for white people to be called cracker, but not the opposite? As if I would ever emit that word from my lips.   I believe its wrong to say, "all Arabic's are terrorists" that is a lumping of race. My other question may not be ready to be heard yet.      Also, why do some white people act black?       Thank you and I hope that I do not offend anyone, I need a little clarification, please be polite when voicing your opinions. Thanks!
20090222192318AAniBon	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Based on these facts, would these teacher appreciate a drawing from me as a parting gift?	I'm kind of established as "the artist" at my school, though I wouldn't say I'm the best, yet I guess because I'm a senior, I get more recognition (and I take art seriously, especially commentry on my art) than others (haven't met anyone at school who draws other than manga/graffiti).      Anyway, I plan to give artwork to two teachers. I've heard that giving art work isn't a good idea, yet I think because I'm at a high school I don't apply as a "child". My art style is based of Norman Rockwell (facial wise) and Street Fighter, if that matters. Anyway...   1. My art teacher, currently on maternity leave. She's helped to refine my work in terms of shading and exploring the other aspects of art other than drawing (even though my painting/printmaking/scuplting is particularly weak). I've known her since my Junior year, and she provides me free materials if I need any, mainly torillions (she doesn't do that with many, makes them return them). Also contributes music to me (to listen to and a guitar that's broken (which I still took)).    2. A theology teacher (I've never had him, yet his rep. among the school as one of the better teachers is appearant to me), runs the newspaper, of which I'm the illustrator. There's another one, yet he does a different style of art. I'm also painting his classroom door (inner), which he requested of me. I've known him for about most of my senior year, and since my art teacher is off, I refer to him for art critique (b/c I've gotten a sketchbook I work on and can no longer take art classes as I've done I-IV of them).   I guess I can kinda compare them to each other as they're both mellow and down to earth, and both have an interest in art. =D   Well?

I live in one of the residence halls here and I have a few questions about one of my neighbors.       About a 2 months ago, during winter break, he called and asked me to go to the movies with him or to come to his house and that he would rent one that we could watch together. I declined.       From that point, I've noticed him being nicer and nicer to me and we seem to be growing closer.       Today, he came to my room and we sat on my bed together and watched TV for about 2hrs and talked about random stupid stuff.        Friends say that he's gay, I can't tell for sure. His Facebook profile says that he's interested in women but, IDK...       He's very religious too...      What do you think? Could he be gay? Is he interested in me?

One of the most daunting things in this society is that we, or more precisely myself, cannot distinguish between whether something is clearly in the boundary of satire or actual appeals to an honest opinion.      I came across        http://www.lovegodsway.org/       It's about converting homosexuals into "normal" people as we know it (or do we?). Check out their "gay bands" and "safe bands", and several youtube video, including their smash single.      And then you tell me whether it's satire or a real thing. I watched his youtube (donnie something) channel and he strikes me as a satirist but then he crosses into something more serious.      I am calling it real for now

How do white women especially in the SOUTH feel about black women being raped during slavery. I have always wonderd if they feel now or felt back then any SYMPATHY as women due to the fact that so many black women were raped.    I dont mean black as in 100 % african. Almost all of the women that were raped back then already had some white blood from previous generations. meaning that maybe there mother and grandmother had also been raped by white men, but they were all considered black.    In my family I have been told stories about my great grandmother who told my grandmother about the things that were done to her by white men.    In my experience,most black people and white people alike hate to talk about slavery and  want to pretend like it never happened,  they want to forget that there is evidence of it in the color of my skin and many others like me, they want to forget the fact that black have more than just a little white blood.

My 14 year old daughter is so obsessed with Naruto and I was worried it was just her but her friends are addicted also. Thank goodness my 11 year old doesn't like it. But I have watched a few of the shows and have stopped my child from watching them. She is too old for cartoons and anything as addictive as Naruto can't be good for her. I would like to hear from other parents and their thoughts on Naruto.

20090222192451AAkD8o0	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Should you judge someone because they cut?	I cut myself because a girl broke up with me..We went out for about 4 in a half months and i really loved her.. Though unfortunately her 'love' was just an infatuation.. Ever since then ive been seriously depressed and have just kept it all inside. This is like my deepest secret so its very hard to talk about it even just typing it. I tell my friends im over her and have moved on, although i havent i just dont want any attention on the matter..  My way of releasing all of this is cutting myself.. My friends notice my cuts and i just give them an excuse and they never believe me there like "Yeahhh sure Tim" (my name is Tim). And i feel like they judge me on it because they dont know why i do it, they think i do it for attention. Now that i told you my story here is the original question ive been getting at, are they right or wrong to make an assumption and judge me on it? I mean i dont want to go along thinking there wrong to judge me on that and then get slapped in the face (just an expression not literally slapped) because they were right to judge me. Please give me an honest opinion and thank you.

He recorrido todas las religiones mayoritarias en busca de Dios.Todas me dicen que son ellas las verdaderas y las demas falsas o de sataná. casi todas hablan de jesucristo como salvador pero tienen diferentes maneras cada una de adorar y diferentes esperanzas. Todas tienen los mandamientos de la ley de DIos y sus propios mandamientos que a veces apagan los de Dios. Todas hablan del amor entre las personas y sin embargo han participado en  guerras de hermanos unos contra otro.   Por fabor: Alguno que me pueda aportar algo nuevo y fresco, algo que no sea misterio. Algo que la respuesta no sea mas dificil que la pregunta con palabras enrevesadas y citas de espiritus y almas y cosas que nadie sabe como es, ni que es realmente. Nada de  Alicia en el pais de las maravillas.   Alguien que pueda defender su religion y demuestre que es la verdadera con palabras creibles.

20070507054926AAgAVAB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Vc viu a descoberta dos cientistas que quem acredita em reencarna??o sofre de um distúrbio no cérebro?	WASHINGTON - Pessoas que acreditam que viveram vidas passadas têm    tendência de sofrer alguns tipos de erros de memória, segundo um    estudo publicado pela revista LiveSearch neste sábado, 7.      Esta propens?o explicaria, em parte, o motivo pelo qual pessoas    aderem à filosofia da reencarna??o.      Pesquisadores recrutaram pessoas que, após participar de uma terapia    hipnótica, come?aram a acreditar que tiveram vidas passadas.      Os estudados tiveram de ler 40 nomes de pessoas desconhecidas e    depois de duas horas de espera receberam uma lista com três tipos de    nomes: os mesmos da lista antiga, de pessoas famosas e de pessoas    desconhecidas que eles nunca viram antes.      A tarefa era identificar quais dos nomes eram de pessoas famosas.      O resultado dos pesquisadores foi que os crentes em vidas passadas    erraram duas vezes mais se comparados a pessoas que n?o acreditam em    reencarna??o. Este tipo de erro indica dificuldade de reconhecimento    de onde um determinado nome lhe foi apresentado      O estudo aponta ainda que as pessoas que cometem este tipo de "erro    mental" acabam se convencendo de coisas que n?o aconteceram de fato,    segundo declara??es do pesquisador da Universidade de Maastricht na    Holanda Maarten Peters.      "Quando quem sofre deste tipo de distúrbio passa por algum tipo de    hipnose, onde se é repetido várias vezes que esta pessoa possui uma    vida passada, ela se acostuma com a idéia e cria uma falsa memória    do que pode ter acontecido no passado", disse Peters à revista    LiveScience      "Isto acontece porque a pessoa n?o é capaz de distinguir o que de    fato aconteceu e o que é sugerido", acrescentou.      07 de abril de 2007 - 17:38   http://estadao. com.br/ciencia/ noticias/ 2007/abr/ 07/183.htm

20090222215400AAEaHUt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How could the universe exist if it didn't have a will to create somethng and intelligence to do it?	Doesn't the universe need a will (want to do something) and intelligence to create something? I mean there had to be some way that had to happen to create the universe. How did it react to create something without having a force or way to create something? Wasn't there a force that was creating the universe? When i mean force, I mean ( a way,order, etc.) something that was creating the universe. Isn't this force that took time to create the universe intelligent because it created something, the universe? Doesn't it take intelligence to create something. You have to have a plan and will to create something. What do you guys think? If there is no will, how does anything want to do anything?

My gf of 2 years has been talking lately about having freedom to kiss specific other people if she is drinking & about having a threesome. I dont know what to do - as for both she tells me that I have experienced a lot more, relationships-wise, than she has & she just wants to be able to experience certain things. The kissing "means nothing" & is "just a phase." Same w/ the threesome - she thinks that it is just like saying she wants to try bungee jumping in her life.        I understand where she is coming from bc when I was single the threesome came to my mind & I was up for it. But now that Im in this committed relationship it is a combination of my insecurities & disinterest that is coming into play. Im scared to death that the situation is going to turn bad & she is going to leave - she says it isnt going to happen.        She says she doesnt want to make me do what I am not comfortable w/ but at the same time she wants to have her experiences. Any suggestions to what I should do?Thnx

Perguntou o Senhor: quem enganará a Acabe, para que suba e caia em Ramote - Gileade? Ent?o saiu um espírito e se apresentou diante do Senhor e disse: Eu o enganarei. Perguntou-lhe o Senhor: com o quê? Respondeu ele: sairei e serei espírito mentiroso na boca de todos os seus profetas. Disse o Senhor: tu o enganaras; e ainda prevalecerás; sai e faze-o assim. Eis que o Senhor p?s o espírito mentiroso na boca de todos estes teus profetas, e o Senhor falou o que é mau contra ti".

A tendência de toda minoria discriminada é se comportar como se n?o tivesse preconceitos. Mas isso é uma verdade? Eu sei de gays que n?o gostam de pobres( vide o caso do jornalista gay Duílio Ferronato, que escreve a coluna gay da Revista da Folha, do jornal Folha de S. Paulo, que disse literalmente "n?o gostar de pobres e que todo militante gay é feio, gordo e se veste mal". Antes de representar uma exce??o, Duílio é, infelizmente, uma norma no meio gay. Outro exemplo: conheci um gay que dizia "odiar nordestinos", no entanto, na calada da noite, essa mesma triste figura saia para "ca?ar pedreiros"; pedreiros faziam parte da sua fantasia sexual. Ora, a grande maioria dos pedreiros n?o s?o nordestinos?    Tudo o que é negado n?o é trabalhado, portanto, se negamos os nossos preconceitos, n?o refletimos sobre eles. A ditadura do "Politicamente Correto" também contribuiu muito para que as pessoas fingissem ser o que n?o s?o. E você, quais s?o seus preconceitos? Tem amizades com os exemplos?

Il y a plusieurs raisons :      Mais disons que l'une des principales c'est que je trouve que ?a commence de fa?on très immorale :    S'il n'y a qu'un homme et qu'une femme, ils ont eu des enfants (en admettant qu'ils étaient fertiles !). Bon, mais après cela voudrait dire qu'ils ont probablement couchés avec leurs enfants, et que les enfants ont couchés entre frères et soeurs, et ainsi de suite.... ?! Et oui, comment sommes-nous devenus des milliards ?...      Ensuite, Dieu a fait l'homme à son image : était-ce une femme ou un homme ? Avait-il la peau noire, jaune, blanche... ? Etait-il handicapé, valide, petit, gros....      Vous l'avez compris, je ne suis pas croyante, mais j'adore parler religion, ?a m'intéresse et je respecte les croyants (quelque soit la religion)      J'ai hate de vous lire. Respectueusement.

20061011052612AAS0AaR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think...?	That some people hold onto a literal heaven and hell so strongly because they don't believe that the world we live in is fair?  There are good people all over the world from various religions or of no belief in all, who treat people kindly and with love and respect.  However, sadly there are also those who murder and commit violence from various religions or none.  I accept this as a sad fact of life.  What are some of your thoughts?      IMHO, they do.  The first Christians didn't believe in a literal heaven and hell, they were Gnostics and sought knowledge and heaven and hell were from within.   I'd be curious to know when such a literal vs. a spiritual interpretation began.  Probably with the early Catholic church to the best of my knowledge.

20090222213510AAt2Rt3	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What has happened to the US?	Let me start of by saying: i am proud of my country with all my heart. But something is seriously wrong with our country right now. Not just the economy, but generally the society.       I think it is debatable whether we're a more tolerant society right now, or we were in the past. In the past, blacks and gays were exploited. There was racism and a true freedom of expression.       But i believe that the governments in the past were largely responsible for the racism in the US, the people would just follow the government's leads. The people themselves were no hating, it was institutionalized by the evangelical and Church teachings that governments liked to implement. It was the government that banned the smoking of marijuana because the blacks and mexicans did it, but didnt ban alcohol because the whites drank it.      I believe that the political correctness these days is far worse than the racism in the past. We are not a truly free society anymore. We cannot smoke marijuana even though it is safer than alcohol. Everything is monitored. Everything opposing the politically correct has serious repercussions politically and socially. The Americans in the past used to be exciting, daring, fun people. They loitered with drugs and other ****, but they also worked hard to make our country the best in the world.      These days, we are nothing but conservative pigs, who are actually more intolerant than the people in the past. You can argue that against me, but i think we have become more intolerant. In the past, people could migrate to the US because they knew it was the land of the free. It was a choice they made to come to the US, because it was the best country in the world.      But now, we are trying to accommodate all these Chinese and Asian immigrants in our country, because we can't do anything ourselves. Plus, we are not a free country anymore. All the CEO's and top managers of huge firms are Asian, and we are nothing. We are intolerant douches who cant do anything themselves, who dream of the past but dont do anything to implement it; look for our govt to feed us everything.

I have been getting into spirituality and I don't know much about it, but I would like to know things I can do to clear away bad spirits and negativity.       I have been miserable ever since my family visited me. I'm 18 and moved to Los Angeles from NJ. I started school and have been miserable, getting bad vibes from my roommate, been hitting my head, had my sink get clogged, a picture fall and shatter off the wall, and my power blow out. All in one day. What can I do? What can I do to send back the negativity to who's wishing it on me?         Also, what can I do for good luck and protection?   Anything I can do to speak with angels/spirits? And anything you would like to add in doing spirituality? Thank you!

20090426140723AAP8UVN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could this be a plausible reason against claiming evolution as fact?	This is not an argument against evolution or for creationism, simply something I thought about....(that can be applied to other things)       The scenario is simple enough, lets say you walk into the kitchen and notice a cup tipped over on the counter with some juice still in it and a spill beneath it of the same juice. The first conclusion you reason is that the cup got knocked over and caused the spill, but you decide to look at it more thoroughly. You go about using various methods to study your hypothesis including math and physics. In a lab you even seek to replicate the scenario with the same results, and you are successful. Logic, reason and Science all point to the cup got knocked over and caused the spill, so you call that statement a fact. But you could be wrong, someone could have made the spill then placed the cup, you weren't there to witness it. You in essence put faith in logic, reason and science as the finite means to assessing, without error, what is fact. You may argue that logic, reason and science are depended upon in everyday life to produce facts and that effectively they have. I wouldn't argue with that, I would merely suggest that faith plays just as important of a role. We have faith in our significant others, we have faith that most store bought food is safe to eat, that most drivers are licensed and so forth.       What are your thoughts? Again this is NOT to disprove evolution or prove creationism, but could it be an argument for or against either? Thank you for taking this seriously, I truly want to know what you think. I DON'T profess to have the answers, its an honest question. So that being said I will NOT argue with any of the answers.

Her name is Nikki and shes Viet Namese. She was a baby in an orphanage and the american soldiers were having to leave them because the Viet Cong were coming and had the habit of killing all the children when they overran american sponsered facilities. One of the soldiers was out of the orphanage and fleeing with a child in his arms. He suddenly heard the voice of Jesus speaking to him and it stopped him from running. He heard literally His voice from Heaven say to him, " go back in there and get one more ". He could barely handle the one child he had and was very frightened that he would be caught by getting another one and it slowing him down. He ran back in and grabbed one more new born and it turned out to be my cousin Nikki. Our family adopted her and her life was saved. Blessed Jesus...ty...

Por ser uma interven??o cirúrgica de alto risco creio que somente pessoas totalmente responsáveis por seus atos e suas vidas poderiam tomar a decis?o consciente de faze-lo, sem a press?o de terceiros.   Acredito que às jovens m?es menores de idade seria melhor aplicar medidas educativas, agindo sobre a sua forma de viver e entender o mundo e a si mesmas. Trabalhar métodos educacionais junto com seus respectivos parceiros e acompanhar os nascituros também s?o medidas que podem evitar outras situa??es deste tipo.   O aborto n?o pode ser mais uma forma de matar crian?as pobres.

Eu já fui evangélico e confesso que quando eu ia na igreja eu era extremamente homofobico, pois queria reprimir a minha própria sexualidade, n?o será esse o caso desses evangélicos que nos atacam e nos agridem? Será se eles n?o querem provar algo para eles mesmo e n?o para nos?      Quando alguém fica muito na retaguarda desconfie, alguma coisa ele está escondendo, derepente a sua própria sexualidade, tenho pena dessas pessoas, nas igreja evangélicas tem muitos gays reprimidos, quando ia em baladas encontrei dois rapazes do grupo de jovens em baladas, é obvio que eles inventaram uma desculpa para estarem lá, mas afirmarem serem heteros.

Ora, se o diabo existe e tem mesmo o poder que as pessoas(n?o vou citar grupos) acham que ele tem, por que ele teria medo?   As pessoas acham que o diabo(satanas, carancudo, cramunh?o e outros nomes atribuidos a ele) tem o poder de influenciar pessoas, controlar pessoas e obriga-las a fazer o que ele quer, acham que ele pode causar catastrofes e outros fenomenos paranormais, isto é, ele teria um poder igual ao de Deus, mas voltado para o mal. Ent?o eu pergunto, por que ele teria medo de alguém ou de alguma coisa?   N?o seria uma supervaloriza??o da figura maligna? Com qual interesse?      Dispenso cita??es biblicas.

20070605133023AAaFA4Q	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Certa vez, um pastor da Igreja Brasil para Cristo, voltava de uma  viagem ao?	exterior. Ainda no avi?o, algo lhe dizia que devia saltar em Porto Alegre, onde o avi?o faria escala. N?o conseguia se livrar da tal "vo'z". Em Porto Alegre, n?o teve jeito, saltou e foi para uma pequena pens?o, sem saber o que estava fazendo ali.   Saiu para passear, quando deparou com uma igreja católica. Como ele sempre gostou da beleza das imagens e dos vitrais, entrou na igreja, enquanto decidia o que fazer. Notou, ent?o, mais adiante, dentro da igreja, que um padre rezava diante de um grande vitral. Aproximou-se do  Padre.   - Sua bên??o, Padre.   O padre permaneceu em silencio, concentrado no vitral.   - Sua bên??o, seu padre.   O padre, nada.   - Ah, o senhor já advinhou que eu sou pastor, né??!!   O padre, como que acordando, volta-se para ele:   - O que? O que o senhor está dizendo? Desculpe-me n?o tinha percebido a sua presen?a/   - Estou dizendo que sou pastor e por isso o senhor n?o quis me dar sua bên??o...   - Pastor? O senhor é um pastor? Foi Deus que mandou o senhor aqui.

N?o vem de obras para que ninguém se glorie"
