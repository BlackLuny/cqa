I need to get hold of a couple of bottles of Night Train Express (don't ask...) and live near Poway in San Diego. Does anybody know of any liquor stores that stock it? It's a classic bum wine, and was featured in a GnR song several years back. I have tried calling a bunch of liquor stores near here, but nobody carries it anymore. 10 points for first correct answer. Thanks!
