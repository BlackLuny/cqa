By paying up to $750, GE was able to get 15% of a group of smoking employees to quit smoking AND be tobacco free 1 year later, triple the rate of unpaid. Will the US government begin paying smoking Medicaid and Medicare recipients to quit smoking by June?    The paid group got higher payments the longer they did not smoke.

He answered: "But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers."      2 minutes ago   Quran 32:24] And We appointed, from among them, Imams, giving guidance under Our command, so long as they persevered with patience and continued to have faith in Our Signs.

I have an idea...how about you stop singling out muslims in this section because you will not change their belief...you would have an affect on their ideology...you are just making yourself and your ideology look foolish by acting ignorant towards the answers you recieve. Moreover, why is it that people here claim that they follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (saww) and then break one of his NUMBER ONE GOALS...HIS NUMBER ONE MISSION...      the unification of Muslims, for a muslim Ummah, for a brother-brother, sister sister, brother sister relationship. Why is it that you get to pick some of the stuff to follow from the Prophet Muhammad (saww), and then leave things that you dislike out???       Why is it that there are somethings that the Prophet Muhammad (saww) said, that you would not dare to interpret in a different way...but there are other things....LIKE the Sermon of GADIR....which you dare to say that the Prophet Muhammad (saww) meant something else???      Ok...I admit what I just said here is going against what I said in the above paragraph...that it is futile to single out people (as you will not change their idealogy)...but the reason i am saying this is that i am fed up with some of the muslims on this page...seriously...      its like...if a shi3a says something about sunnis....it gets instantaneously rejected...      but when a sunni says something quite simple...he automatically gets praised for...and I quote "misproving shiism" ....???      There is a dirty game that muslims here are playing, and it is un islamic at all.       You are no better than a bully in a school picking on a smaller kid. Continue joining up against shiias....especially the ones who try to unite the ummah....continue to pick on their religion....you are only bringing hatred to your own beliefs.       tfeeh 3ala hol akhla2 :(       and to the Sunnia and Shiite brothers and sisters who continue to promote unity in this section despite their brothers/sisters constant whining of why they would never unite with the other sect....to you I say continue in your struggle...that is the true Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (Saww).      May Allah (swt) guide us all in the right path.       Ya ar7am ara7imeen

20090227111316AAd2XEP	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Advice from Muslims, particularly western brothers?	I need some advice on something that has been killing me now for almost two years, all the time. I think that my western brothers could be relate or talk about this issue, but any help is appreciated. I must warn that my story is long and contains some sexual content. Thanks for everyone's help and your patience with me.   Hey Everyone. Sorry that this is so long, but it’s been bothering me and I have to get it off my chest, and see what people’s opinions are so hopefully I can put my mind to rest. Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)   She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,   More than half a year ago, I remembered this event and it started bothering me. Did this woman feel violated by my actions? Did I sexually assault someone? I became very harsh on myself and forgot to remember that it was a stupid thing I had done- but I didn’t force her to, and I would have stopped had she asked me to. I have been obsessive about the event and I am now taking meds for my depression. Though the meds have helped and my quality of life is returning, the questions still bother me - Is this woman alright? What if she had never kissed someone before and I violated that for her? Will I ever accept myself and be able to forgive myself and move on? I would never do something to hurt or violate another person, and I feel like I’ll never be able to fully forgive myself.   At the height of my depression I did not want to live and considered myself the worst, most vile scum on the planet, but I am starting to come around to realize I made an honest mistake and didn’t mean any harm      *****NOTE********   I am not muslim now but I study and wish to one day soon convert.   Please do not judge me too harshly. I was just trying to be something that I wasen't at that time.. I am trying my best to reform my life

An average of 29,000 whites commit suicide every year.      Not even 2,000 black people commit suicide a year,   the number is even lower than 2,000, for all black    U.S citizens. The exact number for 2005 and was   a measly combined total of 1,992 blacks.       The fact that blacks are sometimes very over-represented   in things such as crime statistics prove however that the    # of black suicides COULD be much higher, but they are NOT.      Black think suicide is a sign of weakness    and mental instability. Besides, black peoples    minds are typically very strong and black   people can not be *broken* by any situation.

Sahih Bukhari   Volume 8, Book 82, Number 800e:    Narrated 'Ikrima from Ibn 'Abbas:       Allah's Apostles said, "When a slave (of Allah) commits illegal sexual intercourse, he is not a believer at the time of committing it; and if he steals, he is not a believer at the time of stealing; and if he drinks an alcoholic drink, when he is not a believer at the time of drinking it; and he is not a believer when he commits a murder," 'Ikrima said: I asked Ibn Abbas, "How is faith taken away from him?" He said, Like this," by clasping his hands and then separating them, and added, "But if he repents, faith returns to him like this, by clasping his hands again.    --------------------------------------...   Volume 8, Book 82, Number 801:    Narrated Abu Huraira:       The Prophet said, "The one who commits an illegal sexual intercourse is not a believer at the time of committing illegal sexual intercourse and a thief is not a believer at the time of committing theft and a drinker of alcoholic drink is not a believer at the time of drinking. Yet, (the gate of) repentance is open thereafter."

Because I am scared out of my mind.      I do really care for her, I don't want her to stop being my friend but...      It's so complicated. Just need some help....
20090309182849AAA7aJy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Bible is just a story, why so much arguements?	Isn't the Bible just a historical/mythical story?      I am tired of all those Christians arguing whether there's free will in Christianity or not. Because in the story it obviously implies that people have free will and gives concepts of free wills, so no matter what people try to argue, it's only people's different interpretations or views. But the Bible is still the same, the same old story.

Hello,my American friends,I’m a college student from China.My friends have some problemand I don’t know how help my friends.I need your advice   My friends lost himself in the hole of computer game.They nearly spend all the spare time on it.Every night they make noise that make me not to sleep well until 2 am.At the daytime,they didn’t have class,and sleep in the dormitory.I have try many ways to ask them not spend more time on computer game and learn more knowledge in the school.but they didn’t listen to it. I At the begin of college,we always talk about the future and important news happened in the world.But now everything has changed.On their opinion,the company and enterprises they work for in the future didn’t care much what you study in the college but the diploma,and their parents have arranged all of his things after graduating,It’s no need for them to care about,all they should do it to have fun.It’s pity to hear that,but I don’t know how to persuade them to change this thoughts,I need your advice.   As you know in china,the student must work hard,if you want to go to college,our parent and teacher always use this words to inspire us,if you study hard,you can enter the good college,and you will have a bright life.The high school teacher teach the methods of testing not the knowledge.and the student must recite the best answer to solve the problem.The teacher and parents urged the student to work hard,and usually the student not have weekday.All they should to do it to learning well.they didn’t care much other things.When they go to college,everything has changed,most of student out of control,and have no goals for their future.The teacher didn’t care much the students,the student can do all they want to it.   谢谢，我的美国朋友(This Chinese sentence mean:”Thank you my American friends”)

I've heard time and time again that a family has a retarded child becuase God is punishing the parents. But isn't he really punishing the child? The parents will still love him (hopefully, if they don't then it completely defeats the purpose of handicapping the child and thus punishing the parents)....      Just why punish the child and possibly the parents? Seems kinda unfair to me. Like let me kill your wife becuase you killed my son...

20090309191931AALHjqq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To all Christian women. if you believe what Paul taught why do you answer biblical questions on here from men?	Church is wherever you make it. So if you believe that Paul letter are inspired by God. Why do you answer men questions on there? Or is this one of those I choose to disobey the word of God when it comes to certain scripture?   I asked this question because I do not believe Paul letters are all connected with God and most of you have tried defending Paul's letter. So if you are going to defend his letters, shouldn't you at least follow his teaching.    1st Timothy 2:11-15   11   Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.   12   But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.   13   For Adam was first formed, then Eve.   14   And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.   15   Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.      I would never tell someone not to preach or to teach because of what sex they are. But if you are going to say that you believe what Paul state is from the Lord, shouldn't you at least honor that?

20090309191521AAyoUzN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can anyone else see the irony in a Catholic Cardinal criticizing stem cell research because it is…”?	“…treating vulnerable human beings as mere products to be harvested.”       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_o...       Because, you know, the Catholics have been treating ‘vulnerable human beings’ like cattle to be herded and exploited for thousands of years.       I can’t help but think that religious groups use this ‘pro-life’ image as a way of window dressing their specific religion, do you think so too? This situation is more evident in the US where groups of crazy ‘pro-lifers’ make a big show of caring for the unborn but will raise hell if the government hands money out to babies and their parents after they’re born and would rather the babies starve than get money or food for nothing. So, as cynical as it seems, I don’t think ‘pro-life’ religious loonies care that much about embryos and fetuses; I think they just use these issues to advertise their piety. It’s like saying, “Join my religion and give money to my church because just look how much I care for the unborn!”      And another thing that article raises; why do you think the Mormon organization hasn’t yet taken a stance on the issue of stem cell research? Since these guys think of themselves as the bestest ‘Christians’ in the modern era, I would have thought they’d be quick to jump on the ‘anti-stem cell research’ bandwagon…

20090309192904AA2yu7Y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What happens if you have accidentally seen a muslim woman not wearing her hijab?	Today I went over to a friends house who is muslim and had a moment that made me feel slightly uneasy. His mother is caring about their islamic ways and she wears a hijab all the time except when in the home of course. Today after I went over to the house the little brothers kept screaming out the window and I would look until the third time I looked his mother which I had never seen before was sitting on the couch watching TV. As soon as she noticed me she excused herself and later came outside wearing the headscarf. I asked my friend and he said not to worry however I just wanted a second opinion. Does she have to say some kind of prayer because of this or is it really just a simple mistake.

These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.       Genesis 7:21-23    And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.    Num.13:33 And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim); and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.

There is no experienced psychologist or therapist there to actually work things out with you and talk to you about your problems. Instead, there's some preacher who doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. The only thing worse than church counseling is church youth groups.

20090309205651AAzVPqJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A new bible for the christian and atheist alike (now we can agree)?	The Book of Creation   Chapter 1   1    In the beginning God created Dates.    2    And the date was Monday, July 4, 4004 BC.    3    And God said, let there be light; and there was light. And when there was Light, God saw the Date, that it was Monday, and he got down to work; for verily, he had a Big Job to do.    4    And God made pottery shards and Silurian mollusks and pre-Cambrian limestone strata; and flints and Jurassic Mastodon tusks and Picanthopus erectus skulls and Cretaceous placentals made he; and those cave paintings at Lasceaux. And that was that, for the first Work Day.    5    And God saw that he had made many wondrous things, but that he had not wherein to put it all. And God said, Let the heavens be divided from the earth; and let us bury all of these Things which we have made in the earth; but not too deep.    6    And God buried all the Things which he had made, and that was that.    7    And the morning and the evening and the overtime were Tuesday.    8    And God said, Let there be water; and let the dry land appear; and that was that.    9    And God called the dry land Real Estate; and the water called he the Sea. And in the land and beneath it put he crude oil, grades one through six; and natural gas put he thereunder, and prehistoric carboniferous forests yielding anthracite and other ligneous matter; and all these called he Resources; and he made them Abundant.    10    And likewise all that was in the sea, even unto two hundred miles from the dry land, called he resources; all that was therein, like manganese nodules, for instance.    11    And the morning unto the evening had been a long day; which he called Wednesday.    12    And God said, Let the earth bring forth abundantly every moving creature I can think of, with or without backbones, with or without wings or feet, or fins or claws, vestigial limbs and all, right now; and let each one be of a separate species. For lo, I can make whatsoever I like, whensoever I like.    13    And the earth brought forth abundantly all creatures, great and small, with and without backbones, with and without wings and feet and fins and claws, vestigial limbs and all, from bugs to brontosauruses.    14    But God blessed them all, saying, Be fruitful and multiply and Evolve Not.    15    And God looked upon the species he hath made, and saw that the earth was exceedingly crowded, and he said unto them, Let each species compete for what it needed; for Healthy Competition is My Law. And the species competeth amongst themselves, the cattle and the creeping things; and some madeth it and some didn't; and the dogs ate the dinosaurs and God was pleased.    16    And God took the bones from the dinosaurs, and caused them to appear mighty old; and cast he them about the land and the sea. And he took every tiny creature that had not madeth it, and caused them to become fossils; and cast he them about likewise.    17    And just to put matters beyond the valley of the shadow of a doubt God created carbon dating. And this is the origin of species.    18    And in the Evening of the day which was Thursday, God saw that he had put in another good day's work.    19    And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, which is tall and well-formed and pale of hue: and let us also make monkeys, which resembleth us not in any wise, but are short and ill-formed and hairy. And God added, Let man have dominion over the monkeys and the fowl of the air and every species, endangered or otherwise.    20    So God created Man in His own image; tall and well-formed and pale of hue created He him, and nothing at all like the monkeys.    21    And God said, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of the earth. But ye shalt not smoketh it, lest it giveth you ideas.    22    And to every beast of the earth and every fowl of the air I have given also every green herb, and to them it shall be for meat. But they shall be for you. And the Lord God your Host suggesteth that the flesh of cattle goeth well with that of the fin and the claw; thus shall Surf be wedded unto Turf.    23    And God saw everything he had made, and he saw that it was very good; and God said, It just goes to show Me what the private sector can accomplish. With a lot of fool regulations this could have taken billions of years.    24    And the evening of the fifth day, which had been the roughest day yet, God said, Thank me it's Friday. And God made the weekend.           http://baetzler.de/humor/book_of_creatio... 
20090309203158AAtpUVN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why should we honor an insane god?	If the religious mind and the church believes that God represents a loving God, then one must wonder about God. The god of the bible would rejoice in the death of his creations.    "And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to naught; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it." (Deuteronomy 28:63)      Should we hold honor to an insane God? The Bible assures us that God possess an evil spirit with hate, and full of wrath, and here he rejoices in destruction! God appears completely devoid of any wit or humor; a mental state that psychologists have observed in many schizophrenics. Does this seem like a loving deity?

20090309210306AAlvc5h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Trinity Invented...........?	I have always wondered how the Christians feel about the Council of Nicea because they basically came up with the whole trinity thing. They were a group of Chruch leaders and bishops that established the trinity as the deity of The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit under one Godhead.       There was alot of controversy about whether or not Jesus was God, and by majority vote, Jesus was ruled God. They also came up with the whole creed of Christianity that everyone must follow.       So how do people feel about the Council of Nicea basically inventing the doctrine of the deity of Christ?      I really hope I am not coming off rude, this is a serious question and I really want to know everyones views.      Thanks!

20090309203248AAdtLUw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does the Catholic Church hierarchy condone child abuse?	This is truly a sick story:   http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/world/53750...       Upshot is a nine-year-old girl in Brazil was raped by her stepfather and wound up pregnant with twins.  Her mother arranged for her to have an abortion as she likely would not survive the pregnancy.  The church excommunicated the mother and the doctors who performed the abortion, expressing grief for the "two innocent persons" who were "eliminated".  Brazil law only allows abortion in cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the woman (or, in this case, girl).  The person responsible for the girl's abuse was not excommunicated because his crime was not as serious, as heinous, as the girl having a life-saving abortion.      This is the same group who have conspired for decades to protect priests who sexually abuse children by moving them from parish to parish.      What on earth is wrong with the Catholic Church that raping a child is not as severe a sin as that child having an abortion to save her life?

20090309205658AAhQrEv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My prayer is being ignored, but why?	I've been let down by a series of guys but I'm still attracted to men and I still wish for someone of my own in spite of all this. I've prayed and prayed that I'll stop wanting a boyfriend so much. I'm sure this isn't the first prayer that has apparently gone unanswered, but I wonder if there's anything I can do to make it come true.       I want someone that I will love who will love me with their whole heart but i'm just so afraid of being disappointed all over again.        I've prayed and prayed that I will stop being attracted to men and stop wanting a boyfriend. I don't ever want to let someone into my heart because it will inevitably be broken again. I've had a series of disappoinments and I'm sick and tired of having to get over someone.      I think a lot of prayers seem to go unanswered but I have had a series of disappointments and I can see that I'm not meant to have one. I'm not bitter about it. I've just prayed and prayed that I can be content without a boyfriend. There's never going to be that one person that I'll love with my whole heart that won't break my heart. I just want to stop desiring that person.      This is making me wonder if my prayers are even heard.      I'm sure I'm not meant to have one, but I want one so badly. I just want to be able to get rid of this longing and I can't.      It seems so little to ask... and I'm being ignored?      I nearly forgot to mention that I'm 29.      I have a different sexual preference... I'm completely straight, but for some reason I'm attracted to latinos. I absolutely despise racism but I'm just not attracted to men of my own culture.    I hate racism and have really good friends that are latino, but I had a really bad experience with one guy (my best friend in college, actually) and he let me down terribly. I'm just afraid of getting hurt again.

I have never been able to find any evidence of this, but Iv heard an urban legend that says Einstein in his late years, began experiments with bending space and time to essentially develop teleportation. It was said that navel ships were tested under the project name the "ChronoShift" and supposedly they were able to have some success with warping ships around the sea.   However the experiment was quickly shut down because strange things would happen to the ships such as the crew winding up in walls or dead.  I was hoping someone has heard of something like this and knows what I am talking about to help me clarify this story that has intrigued me for years.

It even asked if you were a woman who had had sex with a man who had sex with a man. I know that the idea has something to do with HIV, but heterosexuals can pass it just as easily.       I really just want to know if that peeves anyone else off, or if there's something to their issue with gay guys that I'm missing.

20090309195815AASyMN2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, how do you justify your hate of the USA and all 305 million + U.S. citizens?	The MAJORITY of atheists hate America. The majority of atheists are anti-American.       The MAJORITY of atheists are against American soldiers. The majority of atheists are supportive of the Taliban, Hamas, etc. The majority of atheists are socialists who hate capitalism, and hate ANYONE who doesn't agree with their left wing socialist borderline communist beliefs.       Yet atheists criticize a Christian when they say something hateful, and generalize ALL Christians as being hateful nasty people. There are billions of Christians and atheists seem to enjoy generalizing all of them as being horrible nasty people simply because they're not atheists, AND the majority of atheists deny the fact that in *some* parts of the world, Christians ARE oppressed.       And then there's the 9/11, JFK and Pearl Harbor conspiracy theoricies that the majority of atheists support.       So atheists, tell me, considering how you're so critical of us "evil hateful stupid Christians who need to be wiped off the planet", why is it ok for you people to hate anyone who doesn't agree with you? How do you justify your hate of the USA? And atheist Americans, don't give me this B/S about you not hating the USA, because you do, and I'm not afraid to estimate that about 90% of foreign atheists HATE the USA, and yes, I'm well aware that a lot of foreigners in general (whether they are atheist or not) DISLIKE the US government, but the majority of foreigners (even the French) do not hate Americans to the point that they would hope that the USA is "disassembled" and broken up into different countries so the inhabitents (former US citizens) can be exploited by the EU and China. Majority of atheists, foreign and domestic, do hope for that. The majority of atheists are extremist far left radical anti Americans to the point that their hate is comparable to the likes of people who support Osama Bin Laden.      The majority of atheists, foreign and domestic, *HATE* (major emphasis on the word “hate”) the USA and the people who live there. The reason I am so critical of that is because it’s wrong to hate and generalize MILLIONS of people simply because of their nationality (or religion, or both) and hate them for who they are. Atheists are supportive of that type of hate.      This is a serious question, and if you're going to insult me or be willy, please do not answer (but you most likely will anyways). I WILL give best answer to any atheist who can explain all of the above without attacking me for being a Christian and a U.S. citizen.

20090309205239AAGvJij	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Please tell me your opinon on my situation. I'm 29 year old Christian single mother?	I found Christ when I was pregnant, and I have been trying to always follow Jesus and God. When I found out I was pregnant, I had just moved back in with my mother about a month earlier. I was 24 and had been not living with her for about 6 years. Well, I wasn't going to school and not living life right back then. I think now it was from all the abuse my mother did to me physically, verbally, emotionally when I was younger. I thought she was better. I found Jesus when I was pregnant, and started to, with His help and the help of Holy GOD, turn my life around. I got back in school, stopped dating and partying. I even tried to make it work with my son's father, because I thought it was the Christian thing to do. Throughout my pregnancy my mom used to kick me out, and throw fits and be verbally abusive. I had nowhere to go and lost my job because i was pregnant. After my wonderful son was born, I thought she would stop. My mom is not Christian and mocks me being Christian. Since my son was born she has started a physical altercation with me, yelled, been abusive emotionally and verbally calling me many bad names, telling me she should have had an abortion because she regrets having any kids. I stay because she has a bigger house and my son is used to having a big room in a nice neighborhood with a nice house. but the house is turned upside down when she decides to go on rants. I just gave her 1500 dollars rent for five months, plus I drive my younger sister to and from school every almost school day and pay for the gas. I also buy things for the house and pay for dinners out. I took out a loan to be able to pay for this stuff, so I could do that and raise my son who is four until he is older and can be away from home. The thing is my  mom still tells me I do nothing, and calls me names and always tries to make drama and fight. She fights by getting in my face and threatening me. I don't know what to do. is it my fault?

And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.     18:20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?     18:21 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.    18:22 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.    Surely god or his angels would not have been lying? Hebrews 6:18    "It was impossible for God to lie."   So who was this lying spirit?   A demon?   Read the whole chapter, its very interesting account to do with Ahab and a battle. Apparently God was almost foiled by one of his prophets in his attempt to trick Ahab into getting killed. God didn't have much of a poker face and the prophet saw right through him.

20090309194639AA42UQO	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How do I get my package?	The tracking page for my amazon order says that they attempted to deliver the package today and left a notice, but there is no notice and I was home when it says they attempted to deliver it.      Anyway, it says I can either have it redelivered or pick it up at the post office and if I don't, they will return it to the sender. So, without a notice, how do I contact them to redeliver or let them know that I want to pick it up at the post office?      Also, why did they leave a notice instead of just leaving my package? I've ordered from amazon numerous times with them always just leaving it in the mail box or on the porch and I've ordered bigger orders than this. This order was just 3 DVDs, so what was the big deal?      Thanks.

20090309220027AAlfrqJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Protestants/ Pentecostals, you think that people who are dead can not be in relationship with God..see these..?	Parts of scriptures which give you very vital information about this.   I Peter 4( 5,6): but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is why the gospel was preached even to the dead, that though judged in the flesh like men, they might live in the spirit like God.       Gospel was preached to the dead people as well. If people who lived before Christ can not come into salvation for no fault of theirs, a just God can not ignore them. Physical death is permitted by God for our own sake, since if people do not die, the world will be filled with humans. So physical death is an inevitable need for survival. But it is not the end of a person. He continues to live in spirit and is having his chance to come to the light of God even after his death. But a person who did not live a righteous life, will not be able to accept Jesus since he is bound to his rebellious character. But there are people who would have been saved if gospel was preached to them; such people will spiritually become Christ's servants like us and will receive salvation. This is why Orthodox and Catholic Churches consider dead people as part of their congregation and pray for them.       Revelation 20:4 - Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgment was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God.

What's the difference in pronunciation of "Son & Sun", none whatsoever.  Somewhere in the darkness of man it has been misinterpreted voluntarily or involuntarily.  But investigation of the scriptures show that Yeshua was stating the He is the Light.  He is the Sun of God.  He is the Sun (Light) of God.  Nonetheless He is the son of man who was chosen or bestowed as the Sun (Light) of God.      Look at this, when the Holy Spirit said through Yeshua, " I am the Light of the world".  is no different from saying, " I am the Sun of the world."

I hate eating around people so I'm actually kinda happy I haven't gone on one. But I've been asked several times. I always say no because I don't know how they really work. Like who pays? Do you meet at the place or does someone pick someone else up? Are you supposed to meet the persons family? I'm being honest. I've never actually expected this part of my life to be here and now that it is its like I don't know what I'm doing. I've never paid any attention to this kind of stuff.Any tips and advice would be great.Thanks.

I have good prospects overseas but can't take him with me.  HELP!?	My boyfriend and I are in love.  The problem really is twofold:      1) He's Arab and Muslim and, as such, I don't really know where we're headed as a couple.  He's closeted and so doesn't want to move in with me (his Muslim friends would question why he's living with a white homosexual Christian) and he may or may not decide at some point to return to the Middle East to take a wife and start a family.  So as much as I love him, there are those ever-present uncertainties.      2) I just finished a 1-year ESL teaching contract (ESL = English as a Second Language) in Korea and have good prospects should I decide to return there.  Now, I'm in Texas and am jobless and living in a friend's guest room.  I did have a job offer before I returned from overseas but even that's now dried up.        I'm at a loss.  What would you do if you were me?

20090309212901AAIJzB4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So I had a dream......?	I have lots of dreams and they come true in some way or another but in very detailed manner.       About a year ago though, I had a dream about a house that was supposed to belong to a friend of mines. Now, the house was huge, I'd seen it in detail on the outside. It was like the kind of home you'd see on an estate. A huge brick looking house with a black roof. A curved driveway, surrounded by grass and an iron gate around the driveway.       The gate was closed and locked but the lock did not work. On the inside of the gate I was there with my friend ( a guy) my mom, and his mom. On the other side of the gate was my friends father, who I never met so instead of seeing an image of him, I saw my own father. Also on the outside of the gate was my friend's brother who I also have not met or just don't remember meeting. (My friend has been a part of the family for years). But my brother in-law is who I saw as an image of my friend's brother.       Anyway, like I said I had this dream about a year ago and just recently his family had posted some pictures on a networking site and in the pictures posted, I saw the home I'd dreamt about a year ago. Huge homes, brick some dark some light, but with black rooftops. Huge green lawns and huge driveways. No iron gate but they do have an gateway/entrance that you'd drive past as it's a part of the driveway.       Anyway, this is wierd for me cuz it makes no sense and I don't understand why I'd dream about a place I'd never seen or been to. About people I'd never really met, only heard about. I continue to say to myself as I see each photograph, "No one will believe me if I told them." And I suppose that is because I can't believe it. Well, maybe I do cuz it's not the first time like I said, that I've had a dream come true. Still, I am confused and amazed.       Oops, forgot to ask another question. What would a black iron gate mean in a dream? Especially if in the photographs, it's obvious this is the place I'm dreaming of except it's missing the gate.

Then one day they all decided to try out the new tiki-hut to check out the wet t-shirt contest, but were told that it would be closed down because the guy had to go through there to keep adding dates.

He never came to the Kings, he went to the poor people and those who needed him. When is the last time you seen a King need anything other than his own desires?   Jesus never went to the kings, infact he spoke much about this and you all lack to see that. Why is that you think?   if he wanted to be king he could have easily done that, but he showed you a different way, for that his friends were murdered and their notes stolen and voted upon. Would you take the word of Jesus from a King?

It was quite often for several months but haven't gotten one in a while. Alhamdulilah. The dreams itself are not that scary but it is what happens when I awake thats scary. I imagine myself screaming/shouting in my dream (even though it's not scary) and I awake screaming (not those girly screams but a REAL scream when you're terrified [its in a low voice]). I feel like the scream is in a low voice that its not even mine, even thought I know it is me...       My heart beats fast and I breathe hard. Some times I can't talk. I was told this is "jinn press" and that jinns just like to mess with you.      Is this right? And what exactly is jinn press and how to make it so I wont have these scary dreams. And why am i getting these types of dreams?      P.S. I read quran, listen to lectures and go to islamic classes. And whenever I have these dreams I say audhubillahimina shaytanirajeem. And "spit" to my left 3 times and turn to the other side.      Please help! Jazakallah khair.

About a year ago, I made friends with my neighbor who is a woman in her fifties. When I first met her, I sort of pitied her as she smoked, had a lot of garbage around her house, had no real friends or family etc. I'm guess I'm a nice person so I helped her out, and was there for her when she got cancer.      Yesterday, we were drinking, (we've done it before) and I had quite a bit to drink. Then this happened. Looking back, she'd been planning it. Basically she wanted to have sex with me and confessed her undying love in very creepy ways. Not only am I 0% interested, but I'm gay (closeted), and she's wayy older than me. I said no (even when i'm drunk -- hell no). She was sort of like a grandma to me, and now I feel like throwing up. After that I basically said whatever I could to keep her happy and got the hell out of there. Now I have no idea what to do. I don't even begin to know what to do. Help?

GOD NEVER REPENTS:   Numbers 3:19    God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of a man that he should repent.       1 Samuel 15:29    The Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.       Ezekiel 24:14    I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent.       Malachi 3:6    For I am the Lord, I change not.       James 1:17    With whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.       GOD REPENTS AFTER ALL:   Genesis 6:6    And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.       Exodus 32:14    And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.       Deuteronomy 32:36    For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants.       1 Samuel 15:11    It repenteth me [God] that I have set up Saul to be king.       1 Samuel 15:35    The Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.       2 Samuel 24:16    The Lord repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, it is enough: stay now thine hand.       1 Chronicles 21:15    The Lord beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand.       Isaiah 38:1-5    In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah ... said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live. ... Thus saith the LORD ... I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.       Jeremiah 15:6    I [God] am weary of repenting.       Jeremaih 18:8    I [God] will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.       Jeremaih 26:3    That I [God]may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them.       Jeremiah 26:13    The Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.       Jeremiah 26:19    The Lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them.       Jeremaih 42:10    For I [God] repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.       Amos 7:3, 6    The Lord repented for this.       Jonah 3:10    God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them.       Does he repent or not?
20090309215637AAKL1Oc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this proof that not every statement in the bible is fact?	2 Chronicles 4   4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.   Notice "round in compass" defining a circle.   Then with a diameter of 10 the writer gets a circumference of 30, meaning that Pi is 3, we know that this is incorrect as Pi is not 3.   Surely this is a result of incorrect measurement and reporting by the writer of this part of the bible, proving that not all the bible is accurate?
20090309222350AAMXjQK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you have a ghost experience you would like to share?	I have lived in at least two haunted houses that I am aware of and this subject has always been really interesting to me.      I live in Indiana and before I left for college I lived out in the country right outside a really small town. The room I stayed in was very, er, dirty. The floor was uneven and had a well sticking up in the middle of it and I always stubbed my toes on the damn thing. There was no insulation whatsoever and it consisted of four brick walls. That's it. It was said that it was built before the house was even built...they just connected the garage to it. There were two pulley lights on the ceiling that we had to use. Forget about the privilege of light switches... One of the pulley lights had a metal puller thingamicbop on it and fairly frequently it would clink very, very hard against the light bulb as if someone slapped it-- I reenacted the slapping thing which made the exact same noise and motion of the metal chain afterwards. I eventually stopped becoming so horribly freaked out about it...I just started talking to the ghost when I was in there by myself. lol. The old woman who lived there prior used the brick room as a sewing room, but it is said that her husband died while living there. I don't know if that's solid truth, but the metal clinky noise really made me alert when I was home.      Anyway, enough with my story! I would love to hear your stories!

Therefore, unless atheists are omniscient and know the contents of the universe wholly and can say that in all the vastness of this infinite universe there is no God, they ought not say there is no God but at least that they dont know.

20090309182356AAsmyts	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think our world is kind of ruled by religion?	I mean, We get breaks off of school because of only a certain amount of people's beliefs. When we're in court, we have to swear on the bible or "so God help us". The pledge of alliegance has "under God" in it. O Canada has "God keep our land glorious and free". I'm sure other countries have their own kind of religious reference in their stuff that pretty much has no relevance. Also, didn't they not clone humans because of many religious beliefs that everyone should be different and God intended it to be that way? Even my teachers (especially Science and Social Studies) say something along the lines of Only God Knows, or "Whatever the good Lord had planned" or whatever. It kind of bothers me. Atheists and Theists alike, please voice your opinion.

20090309195743AAmkDmn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question to serious Christians?	God has told me that the Bible is true. Praise Him for that. I look around and many of the people who say they believe don't seem to even read the Bible. I don't want to judge them, because I remember being in that position. I still don't read it like I should.      Something has happened recently and now I understand more and am therefore afraid. Jesus told me to sell my possessions, give to the poor, and have treasure in heaven. I know that what's being commanded is very hard to do. I feel insecure and scared, because I don't know exactly how to go about this. Should I marry someone who believes and go off to other countries preaching (since I'm a woman)? Should I literally sell everything I have? If so, where do I go? Should I go from town to town, asking who's righteous and staying with them? Should these towns be in my country, or one with no access to bibles?      I'm worried that I'm not really willing to die like Jesus said. If persecution arose, would I really be able to give my life? I'm scared of pain. I just want God to save me. It seems like the bible is calling for something much more radical and extreme than I have been told by many Christians. It's as if there are two ways to go: the religious, lukewarm way or the fully devoted, extreme way. I don't see many people who are extreme. I don't know what to do. I know there will be a lot of answers that say I'm reading too much into it or I don't have to do all of this, but didn't Jesus say that the broad path is the one that leads to destruction? Am I missing something?

If you have faith in the contents of the bible, well,.... it's ancient.  So your "faith" would not originate from you, an independent belief, but rather, would come from the writers and changers of the bible. Someone has been passing down the word that the bible is the truth for thousands of years. Isn't your faith, really, in the writers of the bible and your clergymen, who "say" the bible is true, since you've never seen or heard God before?      If you are people of faith in Islam, then doesn't your faith come from claims made by your imams who told you that the quran was written by Mohammad who was unable to read or write?  People have been passing down the word that the Qur'an is the truth for over a thousand years. Isn't your faith actually in the writers of the quran and the lectures of your imams, since you've never actually seen or heard Allah before?

(…) Answering, she couldn’t help looking at him. He was really a boy, tall and beautiful enough, that is he was even too beautiful in comparison with her. But she was very distant from admitting the chance of a relation, even only a comparative relation between them. Her thoughts were only for him and, for example, she would like him not to have a so tidy hair style, with brilliantine, like in the newspaper advertisings, because more girls like him. He would have been more beautiful with his hair cut short, without brilliantine. Then she tried to imagine who he were, what he did in his life and, although nothing in his aspect could suggest this, she imagined he was an engineer. But she was led to believe/think it because there was a memory, among her secret memories, which regarded a young engineer, who once lived next to her and who always quarrelled with his wife, and she, who at that time was eleven and still went to the primary school, fell head over heels for him, her fist big love, or better the biggest, of which nobody had known anything. “Sorry, I wasn’t paying attention,” she said realising that the boy was staring at her with a questioning look/air, like if he was waiting for an answer.

Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didn't faze me as i didn't even turn around to help her as she cried and was kicking and screaming, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk and not payin attention to women getting their butts beat to death? I dont care, they are the ones choosing these losers so they get with they deserve. Thats how i feel about it..

So if Schr?dinger's cat is both alive and dead, it is a zombie.  The creation of zombie cats would thus be in direct proportionality to how many boxes with a cat inside we have.  Now let's say we did this on an indian burial ground.  Now obviously, when dead animals are on an indian burial ground they inadvertantly turn into blood thirsty zombie animals.  Does this mean that the relation between boxes and zombie cats becomes (zombie cats)squared?  Are we looking at the possibility of an exponentially growing army of zombie cats?

20090310013209AA830Eb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is the Christian view of the bible the only accepted one?	I mean come on, I like the book but I don't think of it as a literal history book. I don't believe anyone in it ever actually existed as a literal person upon the earth. I'd never worship the Old Testament God, who is just a dictator.. Come on it has unicorns and satyrs in it, and the way Christians interpret it, some zombie is coming back to kill us to save us in Revelations.. There are actually intelligent and knowledgable ways to interpret it, of course knowledge is forbidden by their religion which considers it the Original Sin.. the downfall of mankind... Most of it is based upon what the Church has deemed occult, such as astrology which was more of a way of keeping time (we still use it today) and also a form of psychology, and various other forms of "mysticism." It's not a bad book, it's all in the perspective from which one reads it...

20090309235313AA9YvBp	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	"Why do women like jerks?" SOLVED?	I might be wrong. But I think I have solves the old question of why women like jerks. Not all do, but most do. They offer the woman more adventure and excitement than the nice guy, of course. But it may be something beyond that. I could be 100% wrong, but this makes some sense.      Maybe girls like jerks because of an evolutionary thing. Stay with me on this. The jerks tend to have more sex. If they have sex the species will be preserved. So then through evolution women have been attracted to them for the sake of reproduction. The jerks have a higher sex drive. They are likely to have more kids and therefore keep the species alive.

20090310015707AAvC6Il	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could the creation be closely linked with evolution?	I've been the reading genesis quite a lot lately!       heres why i think it might   In the begining the sun was created then the atmosphere then all the water collect into one place(the sea) and form dry land.....possible connection one big super continent. Then there was vegetation made on the planet   God let fish swarm in the sea and then birds came after that..... yes i know it should be amphibians then reptiles then a split to either birds or mammals..... but its pretty good! then there were crawlers(inscects) then there were mammals. Then came humans after all that!       Ok yes i know how can someone create all this in a week! well his days could mean 1 of many things! 1 it could mean the old 24 hour period! or it could mean billion years! million years! hundred billion years! notice how man was made last......       Now thats how i think it could be a fairly accurate depiction of what actually happened if you interprete it in a certain way!

20090310014048AA7NGzM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How could the Amalekites, have been smitten before there were Amalekites?	GEN 14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.   14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;     14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.     14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.     14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.     14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.    I have included these extra passages so you can date the smiting of the Amalekites, now read this.    36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.   Amalek, according to the bible went on to found the Amalekites. Since he was born way after the smiting of the nation he founded in chapter 14, how can this make sense?   Do not try to say "bible chronology is not written in order" because I have clearly dated these references. Esau (Amaleks father) lived long after the taking of Lot from Sodom, (which must have occured before god destroyed Sodom).

Before you say anything idiotic like "out of context" or "he stayed chaste and didn't have sex" explain yourself. Also what do you think happens on someones wedding night?
