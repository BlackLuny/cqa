9QBlKlFmaa	The Palestinians already have a state.<br>  <br>  Jordan is indeed Palestine.  This Arab state already was carved out of 76% of mandatory Palestine.  It was first called Transjordan and now is known as Jordan.  It was given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.<br>  <br>  The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "Palestinians"; Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense. Yet even Israel itself and its supporters have bought into this false narrative of Israel being an occupier. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|LWzrCu5caa	Why not just say wipe out Israel?

Where as gas, you pay regardless..  hey they could even make it one year retroactive, you're taxed one year of your paychecks, for the previous year's mileage.<br>  <br>  people would drive less wastefully, there would be more gas available, and thus more oil available for heating, etc.they would decrease in cost. it would be better for the environment, traffic wouldn't be as bad. people wouldn't go on as many unnessecary trips, cars would have less wear and tear. businesses could have heavy discounts on fleet vehicles, etc.<br>  <br>  im not sure how they would have had it put into play, the ins and outs, or all the issues related to it.. but a mileage tax would work fine if done right. it doesn't have to be alot on the individual. maybe 3 cents a mile. im sure it would add up and not kill everyone's pockets.|`|eulMjLtPaa	And yet the lead paragraph of the story said:<br>  <br>  President Barack Obama will not adopt a policy to tax motorists based on how many miles they drive instead of how much gasoline they buy, his chief spokesman said Friday.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	Yep.

They are just distracting you with the idea of having to pay for miles driven.  The REAL motive is HOW they are going to do this.  They would put in ALL cars a satellite transmitter that will identify your vehicles location at ALL times!  They will know where you are and what you are doing... Big Brother is watching you!<br>  <br>  Another insidious plan is to force all doctors to enter all your medical information into the main government computer system.  They will know immediately every doctor's visit, what is wrong with you, and everything you tell the doctor... it will all be entered into Big Brother's computer system.<br>  <br>  Another plan that Obama has spoken of, is to put controls in your home that will allow the government to control the temperature in your OWN home.  The heat of your children's rooms will be controlled by Big Brother!<br>  <br>  What they are wanting is total government control of your lives people!!<br>  <br>  They now control banks, they are working on the auto industry, they want to nationalize the oil industry...<br>  <br>  HOW MUCH WILL WE PUT UP WITH?<br>  <br>  No Big Brother....NOBAMA!|`|46eoAIGZaa	This is a solution they came up with because they are receiving less money from the gas tax, which funding the roads and interstates for the states.  Last year the government had to get an additional 8 billion more to the states on top of what was actually collected for the gas tax.  I understand why they are doing it and I also understand why people who went out and bought more fuel efficient vehicles are made.  I'm not a law maker though, so really there isn't much I can do to fix that problem.  Write your congressman if you feel you have a better solution.

She has managed to stay in the public eye by engaging in further reality TV, Exercise DVDs, etc. I think she launched a perfume as well at one point.

And these things don't happen in your country?|`|NQFV2AdZaa	She was made famous by a reality TV show and most people like her rags to riches story. When she returned to the same reality show, Big Brother, as a celebrity, it all went wrong because of an argument that was blown out of proportion. The 'victim' Shilpa forgave Jade soon afterwards and has been close friends with Jade since. Haters forget that 2 other celebs were involved too, Jo and Danielle. While Jo and Jade were very sorry for their actions, Danielle smirked her way through her eviction interview. Jade DONATED all her fee from Celeb BB to charity and any subsequent fees she recieved for interviews were donated too. She also gave ￡25,000 to an Indian children's charity and has done a lot of charity work in her own right. Now sadly she has cancer and is dying. She's going public to try and obtain as much money for her two sons, aged 4 and 5. It's very sad, she had an awful childhood, but isn't a bad person, just made a few mistakes like we all do. Are you going to jump on the haters' bandwagon too? By the way you criticise the UK, but what excuse do you have for the likes of Paris Hilton becoming famous over a sex tape? Then there's Miley Cyrus posing almost nude at 15! I could name more trashy US 'celebs', but i'm sure you'll know them all.|`|w9L0ACypaa	She made herself famous by showing herself to be an incredibly gobby, ignorant low-life on 'Big Brother' about (5?) years ago.<br>  <br>  When she came out of the show she worked her fame and became a household name, winning popularity by slowly changing into a more normal and liked person.<br>  <br>  She became so well-known that she was invited back onto Celebrity Big Brother (as a celebrity now...) a few years ago, with her boyfriend and mother....  There was a huge media frenzy when footage showed her being a racist bully towards a co-guest on the show, indian actress Shilpa Shetty.  Channel 4 got in a lot of trouble and even Gordon Brown referred to the disgrace of it.|`|QBV7StrBaa	she was on big brother (normal one not celebrity) about 6/7 years ago. She got quite far I think perhaps even won it. She was notoriously stupid in a nice sort of way. e.g. she is from Kent but didn't know where it is. She became a celebrity from somehow managing to stay in the public eye. Then she was on celebrity big brother about 2 years ago, when she and two other celebrity girls (Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara) said some racist stuff to Shilpa Shetty (Bollywood Star). Then most of the UK hated her. She slowly won the public over and made up with Shilpa Shetty. Now sadly she is dying of cancer.|`|KpccFDp8aa	oh dear do you feel better after your little rant, where do you live because if it 's the USA please don't make me laugh,talentless celebs we get all our crap ideas and rubbish Tv programmes etc from your country.think Paris Hilton for starters to name just one recent export from USA Most of the crap in the UK came from the West we had wonderful building great language fantastic theatre until we started importing all that is bad from USA.<br>  I would love to know where your from because I can't think of a country that hasn't got millionaires who have done nothing good to get rich or become celebs with no talent unless you live in middle east then every other communist and capitalist countries breed,  <br>  These people celebs etc are I agree with you  are talentless and pathetic but they exist in all societies particularly in USA.So don't criticise a young woman with small children whi is staring death in the eye very soon.Your comments are extremely cruel.What amazing gifts do you possess and share with your fellow humans ( or is it just to criticise dying young women) SAD !!|`|KXjXN26maa	She was basically the girl from big brother who had a big gob, acted dopey and basically made the show popular.

f79ee758b104472a746b0b45a244c14eaa	I work for a news station and yes we do get some of our news from the AP but if you watch just the other three stations in my market, we sometimes all put a different spin on a story.  The AP gives facts and quotes and it is up to the next person to do what they will with the info.  The AP has offices all over the country, and basically it works just like a news station.  There are reporters and they go cover news.  They write their story and send it out to all media.
gGZz2EGyaa	That is awful to read, and to answer your question yes he should be deported.  First he goes to jail, then deported back to his own country.  The  illegal immigrants are always claiming that they would be in fear of their lives if they went back home, okay for some people that might be the case.  Once they have committed a crime in this country then I say send them back home, they have taken a life in this country. Tough is what I say if they fear for their own lives, tough because they have taken a life of someone in this country!|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	they should be set adrift in the sea with a bomb that will go off if they get near the UK shores again|`|QXhfiYanaa	Deported for sure.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	What difference does it make what we think?  It's up to the legal system to decide.|`|AS4pWko5aa	he should be deported and serve his sentence in his own country|`|aZXnW6AUaa	send hiim back|`|DbSKW8nKaa	Jailed, then deported with as many others as they can get hold of.|`|w9SW2jXoaa	definately deported i think its discusting that sometimes they get to stay here.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	How is it they manage to get into this country in the first place? Wouldn't you think we would have some kind of international agreement about not allowing people like him to have a passport?|`|AA11111822	String him up then there would be no cost in deporting him|`|BhWmEZWNaa	They should tell the country in which they are from.

He would have killed wherever he went.    Deporting him would not be justice to the victim's family    He should be in prison for the rest of his life.|`|xSU4lMm3aa	He should be jailed in the U.K. where he'll actually do his time. It's common in many counties to be able to bribe your way outa prison. To be honest, I only skimmed thru the story quickly but the convicted sounds to be of Mexican or Latin American decent - those are the exact places where there are many corrupt "officials". Bribery is an accepted way of life there.|`|uKrdjrJiaa	Deported.Why should any UK tax payer be responsible for clothing and feeding him.I would like to see him pull the same stunt on a Bolivan policeman man(be it a real one or not) he would be executed instantly.Just proves that some immigrants believe the law in the UK are soft touches!
236c93851f8140793a37dd76c210a733aa	Hello,  Since it is an English class, ou don't have to delve deeper in economics! Just read few articles covering both the crisis (look in Financial Times or MSNBC for instance), and read social articles on joblessnes in the US (articles that match both economy and society, like they have people talking about losing their jobs). Then take a pen and a paper and try to come out with your ideas, inspired by these articles. I am sure you will come out with something concrete.    Good luck|`|vppzyQFaaa	If you are having trouble then ask your teacher for help or research.              Good luck on it I hope you get an A+
qhBKqGdwaa	i completely agree with you. the people who report to leak always provide a link to the picture, which leads to the picture being spread even more on the internet. very hypocritical of them <br>  <br>  but i actually think that it turned out to be for the best that the rhianna photo got leaked cos it reveals chris brown as the abuser he is cos from the photo we can see it wasnt a more shove or light slap, but that it was a serious beating (her face is bruised, swollen,cut)|`|sLEdPDkHaa	I wanted to see it so maybe we are all guilty|`|4mkyTYXDaa	personally, I need serious proof that thats actually her ,,, i probably would believe thats real bruises and everything if the pic was not blurred out ,,,seems to me like the work of a grade A --adobe photoshop fiend :)<br>  <br>  But also if it is her, thats a big coincidence  that since shes staying out of the media and everything she finally shows her face to  a camera (also why a camera or what seems to be a phone camera ..whyyyy?!) its leaked onto the internet?! WHAT ARE THE CHANCES! :) ' :p
5w5su7Zcaa	Yes it is very embarrassing our country acts as if its never seen snow before it's not like we don't know it's coming people get paid alot of money to watch these things.  Don't worry because in the summer we'll get a week of very hot weather and we'll be told not to use our garden hoses because we don't want to use up all that water!!!!|`|OXp8WTouaa	i like the snow but very pissed off cos the mail man isn't coming, i want my dam playstation 3 game to arrive already geez lol|`|7sI4TtEIaa	This winter hasn't been too bad.  I would like to see a big storm before the end of winter.  We only have about 6 or 7 more weeks that it could potentially snow here in the northeast.  We will all be trashed on the beach before you know it.|`|eq0tJ90Haa	i don't mind it on one hand as its given me extra time to get all my work done, but on the other hand i need to get some work checked over before monday and if its still like this by the end of the week i'll be really stuck :/|`|TOoNHNv9aa	we are supposed to get a foot of snow today in NW indiana.|`|BTCtT6edaa	I'm fed up of hearing about how the snow brought the whole country to a standstill when it didn't, it brought south east England to a standstill while most of the country just went about its normal business.|`|AA11569882	Aw, it's only been two days!  Admitedly, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves the way we just can't cope in snow, but still.  I'd love to live in one of those countrues where you get snow for a whole month, and then its beautiful and sunny in the summer!|`|DyEIc0K8aa	I don't mind the snow.. its the real cold weather (10 degrees and below) I don't like. Ask the people in KY if they like snow. After their ice storm it is reported some places will be out of electric power for up to 2 months. Guess the snow isn't so bad after all.|`|VM9KZ0CVaa	Yes, I am way tired of shoveling snow in Ohio.|`|AA12123428	The last time London had snow this bad I was a small girl. I went to school anyway - that year I made my best ever snowman in my school's playing field! However, the same school was closed yesterday and today.  I see what Boris said about the depth of the snow, but the gritters should have been out gritting the same main roads every few hours; the snow would have no chance to build up and the buses would have got out of the depots!|`|HUlyRTrraa	Yes I was fed up of it on Sunday night / Monday morning at about midnight when I opened my front door to have a look out and ended up with several kilos of the stuff on my carpet.    It was clinging onto the front door waiting for me to open it...|`|9kTejB0uaa	If I may inject some sanity into all this hysteria about a little proper Winter weather.  For once in a couple of decades we actually get some snow (great! it might kill off a few of the nasty bugs that have survived recent Winters).  And actually it has been quite a significant snowfall in some places (made all the worst because UK snow is wet, and heavy).  We lived in Canada for 15 years and I can tell you that when we did get a major dump (a snow storm) everything did stop.  You cannot carry on trying to keep roads open if the rate it's coming down makes this impossible.  So yes, roads were closed, schools were shut etc., until the storm passed.      The big difference over there was the reopening began immediately, and it was back to business as much as possible with the minimum of delay.    I'm afraid the media play a huge part in hyping up the situation (any situation) in this country and these events immediately become a major crisis when it's NOT.    We had a lot of snow coming down - in the SW where it 'never snows' first thing this morning - and within about an hour, it was raining!!  I'd say I'd get fed up with it if it lasted, again as it does in Canada, from October to March/April.  That's cause for complaint!!!  LOL|`|VlzlPAEwaa	I live on the west coast, after two weeks of snow i thought it was over, then last week it started dropping again...I love snowboarding, but can't even make it to the passes...it does suck|`|ijeninncaa	Hmm..yes I am a bit too. The first day of the snow is alright, it's soft and   not that bad but the day after, it turns into crumbly ice which is annoying.     ..Now I'm stuck at home when I'm meant to be at school.|`|CvLwS9p5aa	im fed up with being coped up inside and i cant go out because my boot are too small to take off without hurting my feet, but im happy because i get to stay off school|`|6qsocyK3aa	I know, it's so stupid. We get a scattering of snow (and compared to some places, it really is just a scattering) and schools close, public transport stops running, the whole country is at a standstill. I suppose it ws just so unexpected. We can deal with drizzle just perfectly - it's what we're fced with most days - but snow? PANIC! Floods? PANIC! Gales? PANIC!|`|AA10798839	Though with your climate snow would be more common. Keep it all over there LOL. Part of States were this person lives we have two more months of it.|`|JjRhlOg5aa	I'd kill for it to snow here.  In Australia its so hot that 33 people have died in the last few days from heat stroke.  Ouch.|`|xmg9CBnCaa	try moving here to Adelaide - Australia, where we're having a 40 degree celcius heat wave. i dunno what it is in farrenheit, but its bloody hot! there have been blackouts, people fainting and some people actually dying from heat exhaustion. its hectic.

So, please be cautious if you choose to listen to him.  Global injustices would imply a broad global problem, not just bashing the US for the sake of it.  Here's a few:<br>  <br>  1. Man Made Global Warming - evidence is not supportable, but we all have to just eat the fudge the Global Warming crowd feeds us.  This is a topic for all countries.  If you are in college, your professor probably won't like this one, and you'll get a bad grade, so maybe choose something less offensive to liberals. <br>  <br>  2. Poaching and illegal animal/animal products trade<br>  3. Slavery - it still happens in some countries, and has affected all countries throughout history.<br>  4. The United Nations - an organization that can't seem to get anything worthwhile done, has no real power, and half of them are thieves disguised as diplomats.  Again, prof. probably wont like this one. <br>  5. The disparity in trade with China.  Nearly all countries have this problem<br>  <br>  So, here's a start.  Good luck.|`|9iDAB7oFaa	Seeing that President Obama has done the impossible...why don't you do some research on the "Slave Trade".

Whilst Jews made up the bulk of victims, Poles, Romanians, gypsies, gays, the disabled, Soviet cilvilians, Dutch and Soviet POW and Germany's own mentally ill were all processed through the camps.    The is tons of verified evidence.  Auswitz has meticulous records of all it's victims.  They are on display there and you can actually sift through them if you wish.  Auswitz also has a surviving, in tact gas chamber with the victims' scratch marks on the wall and the last gas canisters to be used.      Yes, by the yardstick of the massive waste of life in WW2 the number of 6 million seems small, and many people are willing to be challenged on the exact numbers, but it happened.  It really did and to tarnish the memory of its victims in the way you have done is very sad indeed.  I can't quite believe you are so insesitive to questions if it "isn't a bit smelly".|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Its very sad that even today people still believe that the Holocaust never happened, but it did.  We should make sure that something like that does not happen again. Forgetting it and trying to say it did not happen will not make it go away.  There has always been proof that all this happened and I just cannot see why they are still trying to say it did not happen.  There are still people alive today that lived through it all and can prove it. Having said that I watched a programme a few years ago where they interviewed some German people who denied that the concentration camps existed at all.  You can see why, they lived there and do not want to be associated with something like that.    Your link is very good and thats what is left as a reminder so how can they say that it never happened!

Should anyone dare to deny Moses, Jesus, Mohammad, capitalism, socialism or any ism is not a crime! However, in many European countries denial of holocaust is punishable by jail!! Ironically, the same mobs do not see the Israeli Holocaust in the occupied Palestine. Do you call it double standard and hypocrisy or manufacturing consent and opinion?    By the way, during the WW2 50 million people died. 30 million civilians and 20 million military personals! Yet, we do not talk a lot about those 44 millions and belting the Christ out of lost and found six millions. Isnt it a bit smelly?    Holocaust supporters,  Is it possible to present EVIDENCE instead of insulting and abusing people?     Remember this Israeli Holocaust in the occupied Palestine is going on in front of you and me.

9SB2Y5r8aa	In fact  there is no need to any change of HAMAS Charter , as peace is still so far ;<br>  >>><br>  Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people.<br>   <br>  >>Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace is so far.|`|GOifC7i3aa	i doubt it has changed<br>  <br>  their recent behaviour supports their charter and ambition to remove israel and jews from the middle east ..one way or another<br>  <br>  and terrorist leopards do not change their spots .....it is ancient hatred supported in the koran that encourages their policies......|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	Sirithil,haven′t you understood the tricks used by Amber and her dirty ilk yet?When they have nothing to say,they start to sink the opponent in the cascade of very noble-sounding but absolutely out- of- the- theme phrases,then give the link to what some "professor" who "served in the IDF" said-and then invite you to make "your own research".<br>  Amber is desperately trying to make you look unsure,but you are absolutely right,Hamas NEVER changed its Charter.Since Hamas was founded in 1987 by the rabid dog sheikh Akhmed Yasin,its Charter remains the same as it used to be in 1988,when it was first published.<br>  The text of the Hamas Charter can be found at many sites.For example,at <a href="http://www.acpr.org.il/resources/hamascharter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.acpr.org.il/resources/hamasch...</a><br>  <br>  Starford,how old am I,according to you?14?Thank you,darling.|`|jWNTwnEFaa	wow, you're saying because you cant find the new charter, the old one must be correct, despite being given pretty solid evidence from good sources its been changed? thats pretty dumb. whyd you even bother asking? obviously you only wanted another israeli propagandist like tambovi (whos 14 btw) to agree with you...|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I doubt any Israeli propagandists bothered translating the revised charter to put on the internet seeing as it doesn't paint Israels actions in such a favorable light as the old one. <br>  <br>  Here's one mention from an Israeli professor who used to serve in the IDF.<br>  <br>  "Like other radical movements, Hamas began to moderate its political programme following its rise to power. From the ideological rejectionism of its charter, it began to move towards pragmatic accommodation of a two-state solution."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/07/gaza-israel-palestine" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan...</a><br>  <br>  Other than that, I suggest you do your own research into why you support Israels murderous regime.<br>  <br>  Actually, you'd do well to read that entire article.<br>  <br>  -Just because searching through a mountain of biased propaganda web pages to find a correct translation of their charter that is widely recognized to have been changed since it was written well over two decades a go by people studying it is next to impossible doesn't mean it hasn't been changed.

Don't believe all internet sources just because they're "online". <br>  <br>  I've linked you two newspaper articles that speak of the reform. Newspapers obviously aren't going to have the entire charter, and other sources aren't reliable.

Do you readily have online access to any other countries charter? No. You don't. I certainly can't find the charter for either of the two countries I call home, and they're in English. The one from the 1980s is ONLY put online by Israeli propagandists. And as stated in the first article I linked, and pointed out by the person below,  the political party no longer works from the new or old charter.|`|LgKYrup2aa	The link that Tombovi has given you is an Israeli propaganda site. There are lots of them on the web. They pose as sites of independent resources. Israel has a huge depatment in Tel Aviv that produce information, monitor the media, they protest against many media organisations (incl BBC). There is one section that monitors blog sites and sites such as this.<br>  <br>  The link he has provided is an example. ACPR is a spin off from the "Ariel Centre for Policy Research" - an organisation backed by Ariel Sharon. It quotes the Hamas Charter from 1988.<br>  <br>  It's about as relevant as looking at any political party's documents from 1988. (the date usually appears at the bottom of the page)<br>  <br>  Hamas have a different outlook now - as they have said many times. (especially since 2004 when they received more media coverage) They do not work from a charter anymore. Their leaders have changed several times and the new leaderships do not refer to the charter. They say they have a flexible outlook to a possible peace settlement and have offered Israel a ten year ceasefire whilst negotiations take place.(in 2004, 06 and 07)

Since that time they are killing children, women and old people using phosphorous and chemical weapons, and forced the natives to leave their homes and live a refugees in other countries since 1948 until now.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Latest Israeli war on Gaza starts on 27 Dec. 2008, killing children, women and old people using phosphorous and chemical weapons.|`|SWxcuGlOaa	When Terrorism is warranted as genuine self defence that group would be better called as Freedom Fighters.<br>  Irish War of Independance, for some reason British people even think that the OLD IRA were Terrorists even when they held the same opinion of the vast vast majority of Irish people in Ireland, to be free from British rule, and they used whatever means they had, but of course, them having the name IRA, British people would consider the Old IRA terrorists without even knowing the history.<br>  It would be like calling the Free French Terrorists during WW2 for wanting their country free from German Rule,.<br>  Simply put, they are not Terrorists.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  <br>  To the lady below, you seem to have grossly misunderstood me.

Let them die there – the more the merrier.<br>  <br>  Should the order ("Hands Up") not be immediately obeyed, shoot and shoot with effect. If the persons approaching (a patrol) carry their hands in their pockets, or are in any way suspicious-looking, shoot them down. You may make mistakes occasionally and innocent persons may be shot, but that cannot be helped, and you are bound to get the right parties some time. The more you shoot, the better I will like you, and I assure you no policeman will get into trouble for shooting any man." <br>  <br>  Lt. Col. Smyth, June 1920<br>  <br>  _____________________________<br>  <br>  You simply don't know Irish History, ok?|`|TQOVizbsaa	Terrorism is as old as civilization. Already there were "terrorists" among Barbarians attacking Rome's imperial troops. Both Robin Hood and William Tell, if they existed we don't know, were "terrorists" if we can call them that way. And "terrorism" was widespread during the "Thirty Years War" of the Seventeenth century, and later during the thirteen colonies independence war of the Eighteenth century. Also "terrorism" during the Napoleonic wars, American Civil War and the two world wars. Even Sitting Bull and Geronimo could be called "terrorists". Anybody who said "Islam invented terrorism" is a complete ignorant of history.<br>  P.D.: Even Israel was founded through...terrorism. <br>  For one side is a "freedom fighter" for the other, a "terrorist". Depends the eyes of the beholder. Also: American Civil War Gen Sherman, who coined the phrase "War is Hell", once said that in a war you had to lower yourself to defeat the enemy. Isn't that a form of "terrorism"? Much to think about. [And while the Japanese imperial army used terrorism like Nanking in 1937, USA was forced to lower itself by nuking Japan to make it surrender. For me that is terrorism plain and simple] Hate me, but I tell it like it is.|`|LWzrCu5caa	First you have to define "terrorism."<br>  <br>  I kind of like this definition.  "Acts of violence taken by one person or group against another person or group that is in violation of the Geneva Conventions."  <br>  <br>  Under that definition the freedom fighters of France in WW II were covered as they followed the Conventions in place at the time so they were not committing terrorism.    <br>  <br>  However,  under the Conventions in place today,  Hamas is clearly a terrorist group because they go out of their way to violate the Conventions.   <br>  <br>  So you could say terrorism is being used as self defense by Hamas but as far as it being justified or not,   it depends upon which side of the measuring stick you are on.   Do you believe in the Geneva Conventions or not?|`|a6fUSU2Paa	There is a huge difference between self defense and terrorism.<br>  Terrorism is the act of using violence to intimidate. Self defense is protecting yourself.<br>  <br>  Hiroshima & Nagasaki was terrorism?? Are you f*cking kidding me?! That was far from terrorism.<br>  Would you have preferred the USA use its only other option of invading Japan? Which would have cost thousands of more Japanese, American, British, Australian, and NZ lives than the # of lives lost in the atomic bombings?|`|teeQmWsBaa	I think you should look up the definition of terrorism. Terrorism is offensive, surprising and unprovoked. <br>  <br>  Hiroshima and Nagasaki was terrible but, not terrorism.|`|zfme8PO1aa	You are quite right that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were terrorist acts.<br>  The minor terrorism of Hamas rockets is self-defense against the terrorism of the joint main perpetrators of terrorism in the last seventy years - US / Israel.<br>  Israel, backed by the US which uses Israel as their puppets to deliver that terrorism (anywhere in the world) when it is politically unviable to do so itself, have encroached upon and 'settled' the occupied territories to such an extent that they are now unviable 'concentration camps (far vaster and more populous than the Nazis').  Their isolation of the territories, seizure of power and water sources farms and random stoppage of supplies, blockade of food fuel and medical supplies and periodic air and land strikes killing and even targetting civilians (eg the UN and other international aid agency bases) justify their response.  This removes them from the realms of terrorism which tag the US Israeli terrorist oppressors are keen to slough off their own shoulders.<br>  Do you think its coincidence that US and Israel refuse to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court.  Your hierarchy are well aware of their international criminal status.<br>  The above is from my own head after a lot of reading but eg... <br>  UK newspaper - UK press is US biassed but not nearly as bad as US.<br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/07/gaza-israel-palestine" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan...</a><br>  This is an Israeli human rights website.<br>  <a href="http://www.btselem.org/english/OTA/" rel="nofollow">http://www.btselem.org/english/OTA/</a>|`|8I9uduIiaa	Terrorism, by definition, is not used in 'self defence'.<br>  <br>  And contrary to what some people here try and argue, a terrorist is a terrorist. None of them are 'freedom fighters'.<br>  <br>  If someone straps a bomb around their waist, and then walks into a packed school or restaurant, then they are a terrorist, full stop.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter what 'cause' they may cite.

Korea would do anything as stupid as declare war against S. Korea.<br>  <br>  Their military isn't as well equipped as the US or Chinese forces.  I believe China would step in on the side of S. Korea.  There's no reason for them to back a madman, and besides, it would be bad for business.  China needs the US to keep buying its stuff you see.  Anyways, this would also forge a new relationship with S. Korea, which could also have positive economic effects for both countries.<br>  <br>  With the exception of the military, N. Korea is on the verge of utter collapse.  Any such war would be short lived, and unlike Iraq, the coalition forces would certainly win over the people instantly simply by saying "Hello.  Have some rice.  We won't shoot you."<br>  <br>  N. Korea has regularly rattled its saber, as it were, at S. Korean and US forces for decades.  It seems every few years they do something to get into the news.  Perhaps only so that the rest of the world doesn't forget about their existence.  Otherwise, N. Korea isn't of any consequence to anyone but the S. Koreans,  and the US forces stationed along the border.  Then there's Japan who grows tired of N. Korea trying to lob missiles over their air space as "accidents" knowing full well Japan won't - and can't - do anything about it.  (after all, the last time Japan entered Korea it wasn't well received by Asia, much less the Koreans...)
tDvyf3Q5aa	Israel has nothing to do without US support; they love the smell of billions of dollars that US tax payers send them happily. if Israel starts such a war, then certainly USA must be in. and if such a war happens, it will be the last WW.|`|LTS3GCpQaa	The US won't just look the other way --- they will be complicit in the crime <br>  <br>   --- Russia has said they will see any attack on Iran as an attack on Russia <br>  <br>   So the US might look the other way at Israeli wars of unprovoked aggression but Russia will not <br>  <br>   If Israel launches an unprovoked attack on Iran ---- Russia will end the existence of Israel and has said so many times --- they were warned and therefore have no excuse --- If Russia follows through on their warning then Israel has committed suicide and that will be their own dam fault|`|J9RuKMPXaa	It would be disastrous for all three countries if Israel attacks Iran. Iran can do lot more damage to Israel than you realize. Iranian response would not be one or two rockets but a barrage of rockets, overwhelming US-supplied patriot missiles. Iran can also attack tankers passing through the Gulf which would make oil prices so high that the US economy would simply collapse. The US would then have two options: invade Iran, which would be very bloody (more of a genocide), or do nothing, which would make Iran victorious. Israel's attack will also do little to reduce Iran's nuclear capability, as they have spread out their nuclear assets over scores of locations, some within mountain caves, which cannot be destroyed by any bomb.|`|LWzrCu5caa	It is not necessary to "destroy Iran."  All that is needed is to take out Iran's nuclear assets such as their reactors,   gas centrifuges,   uranium mines, etc. <br>  While they are at it,  they probably would take out airfields and missile launch pads.   It would not even come close to "destroying Iran."|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	<a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=30871" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?i...</a>|`|NMpbLtuTaa	If Israel goes ahead and bombs parts of Iran, the U.S. will probably give it some sort of "slap on the wrist".|`|zfme8PO1aa	Israel's job in the Middle East is to act as a projection of US power in that area.  It is the US which gave Israel nukes in violation of international treaties - the US corporate plutocracy has always had just as much contempt for the rest of the world as they have for their own population.<br>  The problem with Iran is that it is Shi'ite (as are the southern Iraqis and the main oil-bearing region of US' great fundamentalist Islamic Sunni Saudi oppressive dictatorship mates) and may encourage democracy among them.  This could threaten US hegemony and oil supplies in the area.<br>  The same "push Israel into the sea" policy which died a very early death last century, but which the US has dishonestly continued to use to excuse to western voters its blockage any peace deals in the area, is being used to cover US ambitions in the area and deter Iran or any other would-be power.<br>  Israel meantime, is definitely capable of starting a real nuclear holocaust.  They said as much shortly after their nukes were outed when they threatened that if they don't get what they want or are pushed too far then they are not afraid to take everyone with them.<br>  It is extremely unlikely, however, that they would do anything without the permission of their US masters.|`|tod8jy9Paa	Although they have never admitted it Israel do have nuclear weapons over 200 of them but Israel may be greedy but they are not that stupid to even think about using nuclear weapons.|`|6N47TXvsaa	<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-7706851,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/st...</a>|`|IKbch9Juaa	Yes i would hope they do, i think Iran should be wiped from the earth and that Israel could do just that.|`|dOelpoecaa	Hah.

I doubt it. This is hardly the saddest thing in the news at the moment, and people should really leave the kids who have enough to deal with right now alone. Considering the amount of crap they've gotten from the media attention, I think it would be well within their rights to sell the results and story and actually get something back from so many peoples unwanted attention, that they're going to have regardless thanks to the media publishing their names.<br>  <br>  No, he wouldn't be arrested. He would have to be over 16 to be arrested. It's only statutory rape if one of them is over the age of consent and she wasn't. And only one of the boys was 12.<br>  <br>  Also, it's very easy for 9 guys to claim they've slept with her for attention. It doesn't mean they all have. Like I said, they're kids and have enough negative media attention when it's really no ones business. Leave them alone.
YWjhqlxbaa	I didn't think the article was racist at all. Personally, I just think that Al Sharpton wants attention.

The Times is guilty of similar tactics that keep their readers "happy".|`|7xk2N7xJaa	Obama isn't represented by the chimp, Congress is, perhaps Pelosi specifically.

I am grieving for the injured woman.|`|CCl6Eexcaa	The fact that you guys aren't aware of which paper printed the cartoon makes me skeptical of how in tune you are with the immediate and underlying historical, political, and philosophical attributes of the issue at hand.<br>  <br>  p.s. It was the New York Post. <br>  <br>  And, yes it can be argued that it was aimed at congress rather than President Obama. However it's rare that any one person, animal or symbol is used in a political cartoon to symbolize congress as a whole outside of a side by side elephant and donkey or blue and red figures. <br>  Or in Aaron McGruders case ribbon and flagy. This combined with the heavy affiliation and President Obama directly had with the bill would make the average reader believe it is President Obama at the butt of the joke.<br>  <br>  Chimps were long used as an insulting comparative to blacks and in some states in private news letters still are. Thus with the obvious negative historical usage of chimps related to African -Americans it was not only irresponsible but just stupid.<br>  <br>  RESPONSE TO PRAC&MAG'S ADD. INFO.<br>  Wow, name calling? You're calling me an idiot whilst you didn't even know the source to the political cartoon you're defending? There is a world of difference in the quality and staffing of the two papers that you confused. additionally do you even know the comics writer or his history or political views? Don't jump blindly into everything. DO some research.<br>  <br>  And your rebuttal makes no sense at all. <br>  1. yes , I have seen an elephant and a donkey, why do you ask?<br>  <br>  2. President Obama is THE politician most associated with the stimulus package by far. More than any rep in the house of the senate.  If you want to be childish and say he didn't Technically write it then why don't you go hunt down the dozens  upon dozens of congressional staffers that did, get their names and show the list of names to Sean Delonas and see if he recognizes even 1. If he does, you can argue he aimed is comments towards them. If not, ur SOL on your argument.<br>  <br>  Anyway the cartoon was poorly thought out on a number of levels. R.S. Martin said it best "...the piece was clearly all fun and laughs. But anyone with half a brain, especially someone knowing the history of African-Americans being called monkeys and gorillas, would have said, "We need to rethink this."

You are on the back of a moving truck and you throw a ball to someone standing beside the road.  By the time they catch the ball, you are further away than when you threw it.  How much further mostly depends on the speed of the truck and how fast you threw the ball.<br>  <br>  Likewise this big explosion.
