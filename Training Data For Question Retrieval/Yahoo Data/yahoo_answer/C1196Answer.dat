TfxGL1luaa	First, let your husband now that a suit is more than business casual and you're right!  It doesn't make sense to spend money on a suit you may never be able to wear again!  <br>  <br>  Any freshly pressed button down will do.  You can even match it with a blazer if he's really set on a suit look.  Plus, a button down may be more comfortable around your belly.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/02/37/98/09/0002379809682_150X150.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/02/37/98/09/...</a><br>  <a href="http://daily.stylebakery.com/daily/1637_06614_hr.fpx.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://daily.stylebakery.com/daily/1637_...</a>|`|YYiBPvEhaa	I agree, a suit is not business casual. You could probably get away with slacks and a cute top similar to this. Plus, you would be more likely to wear this again later on (Christmas party, dinner, play, etc). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do?cid=5810&pid=509685&scid=509685022" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do...</a><br>  <br>  I would guess that you aren't "huge" yet at 5 months, so what about a baby doll style top you may already have? Paired with the right jewelry and the black slacks, I would call something like that business casual.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

d4l32ISxaa	Get your bangs cut straight across, just above your eyebrows. It will give the appearance of a shorter face. Shoulder length is more flattering than long hair because long hair can make your face look longer.|`|kXhAERt3aa	You need to create a rounder look.  Do this by adding volume to your hair, not length.  There are a lot of products to try on the market, if you go to a local hair salon, they will usually include recommendations and application with the cut and style option.  Also take a good long look at the people in those hair-cut magazines and books they have in the salon to look through - some of those models are definately going to have long faces - see what styles are a good fit for that face shape!  Hint: You also want to keep the hair back from the sides of your face (either cut higher or pulled back behind the ears) so that you are using all the width you have - longer lank locks will cover the sides of your face - making it look narrower.  There are lots of models and actresses that have longer faces - turn your critical eye on them and see what they are doing with their high-priced hair styles - then try some of those at the local salon by bringing in a picture.  Sarah Jessica Parker has a long face and a long nose - she usually looks fabulous though!|`|zsPUmP4Vaa	with out acutally see ur face i would say blunt bangs with layers or ask your stylist to frame your face

I'm sure you'll look great in anything you wear. don't worry so much about looking like something else just wear what makes you feel good as you.<br>  <br>  p.s. if you REALLY want to look for cheap clothes somewhere you probably wouldnt expect is Value Village. its a resale shop made for people who are very poor but if you just have a certain item of clothing in mind and you go search and dig through all the crap clothes you can really find great stuff there. and everything only costs like 50 cents!!

90d89a1aa77583d97b24738c1dd41896aa	I LOVE wrist tattoos. That's an awesome choice.<br>  <br>  Depending on where you're planning on getting it on your foot, the wrist (inner I'm assuming?) will hurt more because the skin is so thin. If you're contemplating getting it on the top of your foot, where the skin is thin as well, it will probably feel about the same.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind your working conditions. Would it be ok for you to have a visible tattoo? If not, the wrist idea might not be the best idea, even if it isn't an offensive tattoo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped a bit! And I hope you're happy with your choice, I'm sure it'll look awesome!<br>  <br>  <br>  Take care!|`|TR95nukuaa	The wrist hurts much less than the foot (i have 1 on each)|`|4064511c78207233b293c97c1d808449aa	personally I think the wrist hurts more. I have tattoos over my feet and on and around each wrist. Though it's only a small tattoo, don't bother about the pain, it's what, 30 mins? It will last all your life, don't let pain be the deciding factor. <br>  <br>  Wrist tattoos can be covered up, no matter what people say, by a watch or bracelet, but it can be very visible if you want it to be. I think that's the best personally.|`|6L4pCQBUaa	OK well i love tats on the wrist but i would never got one there.  You never know what you want to do in the future and a tat on the foot is easier to hide than on your wrist.  Either way its going to hurt.  Best of luck!|`|Tz5kFDjfaa	well...<br>  i dont know about gettin on on ur foot cuz they hurt pretty bad...and if it was on ur wrist alot of people would c it...so it just depends!!!|`|gTHU3ySGaa	Make no mistake, both places will hurt. And you definitely need to think about having a visible piece for work, etc.<br>  <br>  But, also think about this: You want the word STRENGTH permanently inked into your flesh. On your wrist, you will see it every waking moment of every day of your life, and maybe that's where you need it to be.<br>  <br>  Stay strong!|`|n6guENE8aa	The foot is going to hurt more, The wrist could cause problems for you in the workplace since it is more visible. If neither are a concern, then just go with your first choice. <br>  If you are still torn, ask your artist to put the tattoo stencil in both places so you can look at the placement.

Black is slimming and looks more put together w/ just the scrub pants.   Also applies to layering when wearing street clothes.<br>  <br>  I do rock the white undershirt in certain situations.   Love the look of a white undershirt w/ a gray v-neck sweater over it.  Great contrast under Navy or if your overshirt is black. <br>  <br>  I do switch it up every now and then and wear a red T under black scrubs|`|sMU9rE8zaa	White

r4xRkqzdaa	95% on the time... you have to know:    low cost = low quality      low quality means dangerous ingredients and fillers that can cause you to break out, testing on innocent animals and an overall subpar look.  sometimes bargin stores sell old or expired makeup which is also really bad.    i would go somewhere with a lot of makeup turn around like a drugstore, walgreens or CVS so at least you'll know it's not expired|`|yqgjjwbqaa	you can go on eyeslipsface.com they have like $1 makeup|`|1RJyplAfaa	The dollar store, or at drugstores they have the clearance bin or whatever.

I prefer Walmart, since it has more and the prices are cheaper than Walgreen's. You have to know what you want. I like MAC and NARS and it looks really great,but I don't have the money at the moment. But also look the brand and what it can do for you.    For Christmas, I got a makeup set (it was not even a brand) for $5. It had eyeshadow, liner, and lipstick. But the eyeshadow was like colored baby power and the eyeliner was not even real wax. Don't settle for less.     But the best place to get makeup is at the Dollar Tree, I haven't been looking for makeup there lately but I see that they have new hig pigment bright colors that looks like MAC makeup when you put it on. I want to get some. But go on youtube and type in LA Colors makeup (that's the brand) and you will see what I mean...and it's only $1.
AA12196812	You need to put a good picture of yourself under natural light and with no makeup to get a really good advice. I think you should try darker brown - or plum if you want more fun.

Its make green pop!  :D|`|SBLHtsOaaa	Definitely golds and purples.|`|H1chCcVLaa	Shadows in peach, light pink, muted pink, mauve, green, bronze-green, grey-green, brown-green, khaki, caramel, gold, any green mixed with gold, and all browns and greys.     If your complexion is very olive and your dark circles too yellow-brown and deep, stick to the cool colors like navy blues, slate greys, mauve-greys, bright mauves, pinks, black, or eggplants. Use liner in navy, deep purple, black, grey, gold, or brown.    Don't use any green that's not subtle. You don't want to wear bright, vivid greens because they will overwhelm your eye color.
r4xRkqzdaa	getting that airbrush look is dependent on 2 things- technique and quality.    if you buy ur make up at walmart, you arn't going to get that perfect look- that's just the bottom line... if you use too much it's going to look bad too    steps:  - wash and exfoliate your skin  - sunscreen moisturizer  - primer your skin (i use smashbox primer)  - HD liquid foundation (contains silicone to even out the skin- i use makeup forever hd) (use a sponge to stipple it on to areas that really need it only)  - conceal (use as little as possible applied with a concealer brush- not ur finger)  - setting powder (applied with a fluffy kabuki brush- currently i use the stila hydrating setting powder)    and it last all day!  go to the make up counter where you can touch and feel and get the color professionally matched to your skin tone|`|a1KT2SQlaa	While it is true that the type of foundation you use will matter greatly it's the application that matters most. I suggest using a foundation  primer and a brush. A lot of people love the mac 187 brush or a similar stippling/ skunk brush.

	Hey hun.    Hoping I can help you as I've been a make-up artist/hairdresser for years now.    When applying your foundation (liquid only) you should mix a pea sized amount of moisturizer in with it and apply as normal. You will notice the different, especially if you dry skin!     With mousse foundation or powder, apply moisturizer about 5 minutes before giving it time to sink in and work its magic! Dont try mixing moisturizer with these foundations as it'll be too clumpy and like paste!    I find it easier when doing clients make-up to always use a foundation brush with a dab of moisturizer anyway.    Good luck x|`|	Depends on your skin.    If you have oily skin...you should use water-based or oil- free primer. If you dont have problem, moisturize is OK. Moisture is good for the Winter because the air is thin but dry.    In the summer, moisturizer creates oily patches. You might want to reduce or change to primer all the way during hot weather.|`|	Well, moisturizer depends on the type of skin you have, and with today's environment and water conditions it dries out the skin as well causes health problems.  I never use to have to wear moisturizer, but over the last few years I have had to start using it and I apply it right after I get out of the shower or wash my face it seems to soak in better because of the skins pores being open after washing. Then I apply my foundation.  I also use this moisturizer and it works great.|`|	u should put moisturizer with foundation because foundation is bad for your face. u can buy foundation that has moisturizer in it.   if you keep on putting foundation on without moisturizer, ur skin will get reely bad.     P.S. put the moisturizer on first if ur going to use moisturizer and foundation.|`|	yeah it's perfectly fine. and if you run out of moisturizer you can always pour water onto your fundation sponge and apply foundation just so that the foundation disperses evenly and so that you will not be able to see where it starts or ends. Also, Clinique is a healthy brand, it takes the well being of your skin in consideration when making its products.     :)|`|	yes. they also make tinted moisturizer which is just fancy talk for foundation and lotion mixed together lol.

UByvC54Xaa	Dreadlocks are great!!! Personally, After seeing your photo you look way better with natural coloured hair so i reckon the dreadlocks without the blood red would be good. Your hair is obviously a bit longer now is it? They say any length over 3inches can be dreaded.    I say do your research on dreads (if you havent already) and go for it!|`|UjG8FqLUaa	ewww dreads are GR0SS! sorry, they just are. to me they are a turn off and show lazyness and bad hygiene. you can learn to become patient some other way don`t lose your look.|`|ruBJ1KbIaa	I personally would not get dreadlocks(but that is just my opinion). If your friends and family are in to that kind of hairstyles then go for it! You can let other people tell you how to live your life.But, if i were you, i would not get them bloodshot red. Get them a dark or light brown and get very small, thin dreadlocks. Do not get the big chunky ones because those are realy hard to maintain the freshness and cleanliness in your hair. (if you are a swimmer like me) you can not go swimming with dreadlocks. With all the chlorine in the pool it willget in to your dreadlocks and unless you want to keep having to redo your dreadlocks over and over you cannot go swimming. I for one just do not particularly like dreadlocks but that is only because they are hard to maintain. If you think you are very responsible and can maintain them, go ahead get them!!! But if you think you are not responsible, do not go for it.  i hope i helped!!!!!!!!|`|kgdVgHeqaa	if your group of friends are into that sort of thing.    most people are turned off by dreads since.. when most people cut them off bugs fall out of their head|`|P8jI4RmAaa	Ew!

Follow with a plum or black eyeliner across the top lashes.  Smudge and set liner with the same eyeshadow you previously used.  (This will soften the line so it's not a hard edge).  Use the shadow underneath the lower lid as a liner.  Follow with 2-3 coats of black mascara, waterproof if you think you'll cry!<br>  <br>  Cheeks:  a soft pink on the apples of the cheeks.<br>  <br>  Lips:  A soft pinkish/plum liner with a plum/nude lips gloss.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful time!|`|gb62bVxNaa	First of all, you should curl your hair, and leave it down.<br>  <br>  Then you should Wear a brown or purple eyeliner, with Black mascara, purple gliiter on your eyes, and some lipgloss. then ware a concearlor and a tan powder that will look cute....but to tell the truth i would try some Jeans, and a Fancy top...or abercrombie dress.|`|inehp6SFaa	try a tan, a brown, light brow, a medium brown, all browns are really nice, for a communion, or really anything

Pour a small amount of tissue oil (try using one with natural ingredients in it) on a piece of cotton wool. (You can also put the tissue oil on your hands, but make sure they are clean.)   Apply the tissue oil to your face, applying it equally to each part of your face.Massage it in for 5 minutes, and then leave it until you go to bed.   Before getting into bed, take a tissue, and dab your face to remove the oil     It is best to apply tissue oil every night, for about two weeks. If your scars are not fading, then apply it until you see a change.   If you are applying tissue oil on your face, use a headband to prevent oil from getting into your hair.   Tissue oil is not the only thing that removes scars; other creams and moisturizers are available. Use what suits you.     Do not use tissue oil during the day. If you have oil on your face, and go out in the sun, the oil will heat up on your face and possibly cause more scarring.   If you have oily skin with pimples present, it is recommended that you do not use tissue oil as this will increase the oil composition in your skin, and this could make your pimples worse.         x0x0_LEi|`|6zhw1zd0aa	Yes, do a course in Avionics.|`|LIioMo71aa	-wash your face with lil warm water and use a cleanser like clean n clear which prevents more spreading of pimples.  -use garnier light moisturizer it really works for the dark spots removal!    best of luck     :)    !cool buddy!
9yJQevMlaa	nope    .|`|Wpq4qUllaa	Louis Vuitton do not have any sales nor do they sell items which are not quite perfect through outlet stores, anything like that is destroyed, and because their styles aren't in for just one season they never o on sale  the price is only likely to go up i'm afraid  you're only options would be to buy it at full price or go on ebay and look for it, but buying on ebay can be risky so i'd advise readin this:    http://reviews.ebay.com/Louis-Vuitton-Is...    which bag is it may I ask?  I hope i've helped, good luck|`|Wscsgyd5aa	Buy a knockoff if your worried about the price. The trouble with designer stuff like Louis Vuitton is that it almost never goes on sale.|`|MZWH11w1aa	Juanita is correct.  Louis Vuitton is very different from other brands.  They may keep a bag style for 10+ years.  Then if the bag is discontinued, the value actually goes up, not down.  Louis Vuitton never goes on sale, period.  They can control this because LV does not wholesale, meaning that they have 100% control of their products, always.  In fact, LV has a price increase on existing items every year, usually February so the bag you like will most likely go up 10% or so.

gpPRNPqYaa	You can't go wrong with a good pair of tennis shoes... i suggest either nike, adidas, or new balence (they are made in america so buy them!)... they're warm and have good traction for when it snows. However, even those can get boring at times. Birkenstocks are good, I actually lost the pair before the ones I have now.. (weird) or I really like uggs... i know those are controversial, it just depends on wheather you like them or not, but they are extremely warm and confortable. Even the cheap ones that aren't actually uggs are getting really good. I have a pair of fake uggs called bearclaw, they were like 40 bucks and i havent had a problem with them yet... they're water proof, and hella warm and comfy. you can even get the ones that only go up so far on your leg or ones that look like clogs.|`|4iHBjNizaa	You should get clogs :D they are in fashion right now and really cute.  Try this site, they have unique ones: http://www.ae.com/web/browse/category_no...|`|tre5A9w9aa	there are many that you can get. if you walk a lot nike shox would be good. if ur skater like then go to journeys and get shoes. i would also get more birkenstocks because they are good shoes...
VKLyDiQ7aa	Redken All Soft shampoo and conditioner are amazing if you can afford it.  Hair Cuttery is having a sale on their liters right now, so you could go pick up a liter of each for $30.    Other than that, I love John Freida hair care, especially the color-oriented lines and the Luxurious Volume.  They make my hair so soft and shiny, it's amazing!|`|AA12188347	When I use conditioner I leave it sit on my hair fro awhile......I wash my hair first then apply conditioner then while I wash my body I let the conditioner sit and rinse it out just before I get out of the shower.  I also dont use many styling products or heat on my hair which makes a huge different.  About the only thing i use as far as product is Aussie brand mousse with conditioner......good luck.....

I'm still thinking about what I'm going to do with them.    Start small and work your way up (:     And draw your ideas out on paper. If you see a top and think to yourself, "That would look great with..." draw it out! It doesn't matter if it's your own design at first, just draw something.

uaGWofBAaa	Maybe it's because of the bangs, and the way that you both smile, Demi Lovato has a bigger smile though...

Why would you want to change it?|`|llXo66CYaa	You kinda look like her, to change that you should probably get a different haircut, because i think the only reason people think you look like her is because you hair cut is exactly the same, so maybe get side bands or something.|`|lGclixPuaa	uh.... no!

O57Ky6D0aa	I think that'd be ok. On my clinque foundation brush I always clean them with washing up liquid nothing works better than that for ages I was trying to get the foundation out I tried everything and then a painter I knew uses washing up liquid on his brushes and the foundation came out a treat :)|`|Kq2rFuIyaa	you cant you just have to get a new one...i know its a bummer :[|`|tyfeGT7waa	The simple answers is... no. The brush cleanser is meant for brushes, and it works well on brush fibers. The sponges that come with your makeup shouldn't even be used more than once or twice because they allow bacteria to thrive within the sponge. Any sponge used more than twice for a makeup application should be discarded for sanitary purposes. You can get sponges just about anywhere, though. They're inexpensive and will save you face in the long run.

0YupRwWcaa	This is the same exact thing tht is with me.  i take a shower at night  let it dry while i sleep  and straighten it the next morning.  But i really think you should just take a quick shower everyday  if you hurry in can take only as much as 10 minutes of your time  thats what i do and my hair is almost never greasy.  But, if you absolutely cant take a shower,  baby powder works   or dry shampoo|`|d49ZA5xYaa	put baby powder in it|`|MdaxpwLGaa	First of all you shouldn't wash your hair everyday, that makes it more greasy plus sometimes its good to let natural oils in your hair..try wash your hair every other day instead. Dry your hair before you go to sleep instead of leaving it to dry overnight you're making it more curly by doing that...I've done it myself. Alsooo if your hair is a light colour put talcon powder where the grease is and it drys it out straight away =)|`|2TJXGFezaa	putting something in it will make it more and more dirty.  You need to shower at night. And again, i had the same problem as you. ITS YOUR STRAIGHTNER. you need to buy a new one, becasue the one that you have isnt working good for you.|`|lNGUuIwRaa	I had the same problem as you, but I just shower daily now and so should you. I think its better for the body anyway.  Your hair will look better too.    I know its a pain in the *** to straighten in that much but its worth it. Maybe try some new things with your hair instead of just straightening it everyday. Like put it up in a pony tail or leave it curly.

1OxoIuhOaa	The same as any open wound being doused over with contaminants, you run the risk of infection.  Being a head wound and more to the point, a mouth wound, your piercing will heal itself fairly quickly, but it IS still a wound.  Just the same as if you got a new ear piercing and went swimming in a stagnant pond.      However, the while the risk is blatantly obvious, it is a relatively small factor that you WOULD contract some infection so the odds are in your favor.  But it's still a roll of the dice.  If you do drink tonight, then just bring a bottle of listerine and flush your tounge often.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	i would not chance it.  they can get infected easily.  is it really that hard not to drink for 7 days?|`|6oli1iF4aa	It will also thin your blood, which will slow healing.

Maybe you should see if they have anything interesting. http://www.aeropostale.com/family/index....   These dresses would look nice with leggings underneath. My favorite is the blue one. They all come in different colors. And the sizes may be decieving. A small 8th grader like yourself may need no bigger than a small. In 8th grade I weighed about...80-90 pounds and I had to wear extra small from that store. But a small should be ideal for you, maybe even a medium. I would have to see you in person|`|Y4pfVX10aa	try macys bloomingdales or promirl.com|`|fZhqa3Bdaa	i don't know..um maybe sears..or it was me I would go to a little boutique in the city to buy my dress.... :)|`|pUTKCxVRaa	my advice, dont wear a dress.  you'll look way too formal.  just wear some nicer clothes.  one time some chick at my  school wore a dress...she was  the only one wearing one, she got  laughed at. a LOT.  but if you really MUST have one  try big department stores like  macys, jc pennys, ross, belk, etc.

rPT4J5YLaa	Try a really good conditioner and a leave in conditioner after you get out of the shower and you are doing your hair. if you can try not to blow dry it that will dry it out and every now and then you will have to switch products because your hair can start to get use to the product so you need to switch around. Are you on any medications that also can wreck your hair and so can stress. To keep split ends at bay every 6-8 weeks you need to get a trim and eventually you will see your hair growing more and more.|`|sjxO0U00aa	....HAIR CRISIS!

After your hair gets a little stronger, than the "scene" style would be perfect. And even if your a little over weight, scene hair is easy to pull off.    Good luck! :)|`|Op37pHd3aa	if your hair is already damaged scene hair is the LAST thing you want to acheive.|`|pf8OEAG6aa	hahaha @ plus I'm overweight  idk how that has anything to do with it but ..okay|`|6aawDPkSaa	scene hair is not healthy hair.
4uB0bbhnaa	semi permanent hair colour is usually graded at Level 2    and displayed accordingly in stores you buy hair colourants from    If in doubt ask a sales assistant|`|fIeczCoDaa	manic panic is the way to go if you want bright colors like pink or blue.|`|C4HTVSwMaa	Clairol Nice 'n' Easy :)|`|8d8Fp8xcaa	Well every brand does it that im aware of.    especially the ones in superdrug  and they last about 20 washes  or if you want a was in wash out superdrug has its own make with is self explainatry on the back but you only have a few colours with them and there only brown    red nice and easy really :/    shade n toners make myt b good for that sort :/    good luck :)|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	Boots's own brand and they are FAB, they are the only ones that did not damage my hair.

n5wXTZFGaa	Eye Shadow:  You'll look best in pale pink, light to medium pinkish-brown and medium purple shades of eye shadow. Choose one shade only to use at a time and apply it all over eyes, from lash-line to brows. But if you like dark eyeshadow then..GO FOR IT!!! ;)  good luck, you!!!|`|cYtHoGaVaa	The best dark colours for green eyes would be very dark plum, dark grey, and dark gold.|`|lOxEtQi4aa	I, personally, LOVE green eyes and dark eye shadows. You could probably find that exact eyeshadow at CVS or Wallgreens.
AA10529649	Old Navy one.|`|WtQIg0UKaa	Depends what you are going for.  The first one looks a little more flirty and would accentuate your cleavage and legs.  The second one looks a little more conservative as it doesn't really hug anything.  Personally I would go with the first one. :]|`|qCPnoKy2aa	American Eagle tends to have better fitting clothes. They are both extremely similar and adorable, but I would really go with the Amercian Eagle one, it will more than likely fit better and look just as good on as it does on the website. :)|`|M1vcUoo5aa	i like the second one better !

CWEGNnKAaa	Its awesome, me and my friend use it! Its worth the price!|`|S2OvDYY5aa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out several products.I would check out the review site at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and read the reviews.
atAwNvDfaa	I usually wear my hair straight, but it is very easy for me to wear it curly also. All you have to do is take a shower at night and then when your out of the shower scrunch your hair while it is still wet and don't blow dry it. Then go to sleep but don't sleep on your hair. Then in the morning your hair will turn out curly, dry, and non frizzy. (Careful, if you try this in the morning, your hair will get frizzy). Also, your hair smells really good and it looks natural and feels soft.   Hope I helped :)|`|TxoOoecmaa	do not wet your hair when your in the shower.
3TPnm16gaa	just remember when you grow up, And get tired of the piercing There will be a hole in your lip forever.just saying.    But if you dont care about scarring then go get it pierced, and make sure to keep it clean|`|	If you want a lip piercing then do it! Just know you will have to take super good care of it and it will swell up for a week or so. If your willing to take care of it and have it swell up a little then you should get it.|`|	Yea, If you like the look of the piercing enough, get it done... PROFESSIONALLY. I tried to pierce my lip myself the first time, and it got all infected and it was not good. Now I have spider bites and I love them.
mhyL7Qw3aa	Bronze, charcoal, chocolate brown, black, and golds will look good with your blue eyes.|`|Kq2rFuIyaa	golden brown|`|aiAyDpkLaa	I would say brown....It will make your blue eyes POP and it'll compliment your hair and skin color!    I have white skin and blue eyes too! and natural brown hair but it's bleach blonde, it looks good though with both blonde and brown hair!|`|n5wXTZFGaa	Eye Shadow:  You'll look best in lilac, beige, camel or peach shades of eye shadow. Choose one shade only to use at a time and apply it all over eyes, from lash-line to brows. It'll totally make your eyes POP!!!!!! ;)    Mascara:  Apply one coat of clear or black mascara.  HOPE THIS HELPS!!! ;) Good luck, you!!!!!!!!|`|KFyFmi1Iaa	i'm the same, although I'm probably a little paler then you. in my experience the best colors to use are neutral colors, browns, light pinks that hold a little shimmer to them. not necessarily glittery things but colors that hold a shiny texture really make the eyes pop! browns and golds (especially gold) enhance the blue in your eyes|`|GSTcqG4Raa	Anything but blue. I would most likely go with a sparkly silver, my second choice would be a tinted gray color.    Good Luck    =P|`|x43ReKgUaa	bronze would look great!

ZmU6ZNhBaa	L'oreal paris hip colour truth cream eyeliner is very good and it stays on almost all day. you can get it in many colours also. You should try it because i put it on, on the bottom and top of the eye and  it looks stunning and stays on the longest. this is from my own experience becuase i have also tried many other eyeliners and this is the one i find the best!! Good Luck!|`|	I use Alamay twistable eyeliner. They have the perferred color for your eyes. Or I also use the twistable Revlon Color Stay. Or Revlon Color Stay Liquid eyeliner.|`|	i use revlon color stay liquid liner. it works great.|`|	use rimmel liquid eyeliner its the best|`|	loreal paris infalliable 16 hour eyeliner. the twist up one. i've been using it for a few weeks and it's been pretty good. but i ultimately would say sephora eyeliner. it's just a regular simple pencil. it's 8 dollars and well worth it. i used it all summer in the heat an humid weather and it stayed on great. i would recommend that.|`|	put black eyeshadow over the eyeliner on the bottom lid,  just put your eyeliner on normally,  then use a thin eyeshadow brush and put your eyeshadow over it,  seriously, i have a rimmel eyeliner, that is okay but doesn't last,  but then when i put eyeshadow over it, it stays on all day!!    xo|`|	I use Make Up For Ever (Sephora.com) Aqua Colours eyeliners, they are remarkable. You should also look into Urban Decay's 24/7 eyeliner pencils which are the same consistency as the Make Up For Ever ones.|`|	i use maybelline liquid eyeliner in waterproof and it works pretty well
FTBiFqlXaa	Gold. Silver. Shiny Black. Id do the silver though.|`|dPULl5hjaa	silver|`|iXV80Elyaa	both colors would look fine, So i would make my decision based on which shoe looks better. Also, It might be fun to wear something funky like yellow shoes or something.|`|TWMXMOLUaa	def silver!!..it'll look cute with the rhinestones!!!....|`|uoZyjvwqaa	It would be really cute if you find black high heels and add silver accessories (like a necklace and earrings) so the rhinestone design can pop. Hope this helps =]]|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Both would work.  I'd worry more about the style of shoe and how it goes with the style of the dress.|`|HmossOSuaa	silver
Uxs2wy7Haa	based on the price and reviews saying it sucks than its probably not the best, just coz it worked all right when u tried it doesn't mean its good|`|lf17zI7Aaa	No this one is not good.    You will always need a straightner where the place to hold it it conected, as to the one you are looking at they are appart. That will dry and crimp your hair.|`|LWVWvvmJaa	it's like that one chick said evrybodys hair is different :/ but i have the sedu i got it online :) it works awesome!!!! i have really thick hair and its really curly and it gets the job done in no time!!!|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Everyone's hair is different.  If it worked on yours, then use it.|`|hEL8M0rnaa	Nope, i had one about a year ago and it literally split in half.   and it doesnt heat up very well. I have very thick hair and it didn't work for me|`|KPNTniA1aa	yeah, conair is a pretty good brand. however, their products don't really treat hair well, so don't forget to spritz on a heat protector spray every time you use it. i like the tresemme heat defense line, they sell it everywhere (cvs, walgreens, riteaid, target, walmart.etc.).|`|R82fQoikaa	try it
RSv2E2KNaa	Dunno...
AA10529649	I would go with an Xlarge if she likes looser clothes. If she normally wears womens clothes though, I wouldn't get her something in the Juniors department.
zbxjpuTbaa	Hahaha  i went with my friend to get her septum pierced and it looks awesome  the piercer wont put in a ring that's too big. they actually have pretty tiny ones   and you can push the ring up in your nose to hide it from your parents;) but  honestly nothing went wrong. Maybe the most that could go wrong would it be getting infected but the piercer will tell you what to do and its not a piercing that covered up  its on your face where it can get lots of air.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	So since looking like a male bull is hot in your eyes, then why not wait until you're 18? It's only 2 more years and if you still want your septum pierced, then do it. You won't need you're parents permission then.|`|rCzKCCDJaa	lol i dont know but im having the same problem with my MOM but i want my tongue :P|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Why say don't waste your time telling me ..... blah   blah    Then why bother asking the stupid damn question.  You are gonna do it anyway so go away and get on with it and yes disfigured is the new hot - I guess - to the blind
qDgvK3IFaa	they change the mannequins every tuesday
VKLyDiQ7aa	Are you using any sort of protectant?  Creams are better than sprays as well.  Also, are you using a ceramic straightener or a metal one?  Because the metal ones do not heat evenly and can burn your hair.  Get a trim, get some good protector and any ceramic iron, this should help a lot.  If you take the right steps, straightening your hair will cause barely any damage!|`|s0La0YV6aa	well if you have oily hair i would deep condition your hair right before you straighten your hair EVERYTIME!!! Go to your stylist and ask for the best deep conditioning treatment that they sell and buy it.... dont be cheap.... you want your hair flawless right??? deep condition it right before you straighten it, and also find a good leave in condition for curly hair ( if your hair is curly) i know that it is for curly hair but it helps relax your hair and it works if this still doesnt work... try straightening your hair every 3-5 days unless your hair is oily if it is oily try leaving the condioner on longer before rinsing it out!!!|`|YItwHIF9aa	Well...I hate to say it, but you are damaging your hair with so much heat.  I would recommend that if you do have to straighten it, take a shower the night before and let it air dry over night, then straighten it in the morning.  Also, do you have any hair serum? Use hair serum on your hair before you use any heat.  Another recommendation is to take a shower at night and use moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, but instead of washing the conditioner out, leave it in and put your hair in a bun over night, then wash it out in the morning.  That is a little refreshing for your hair and will help it a little bit. Hope this helps!!|`|6geRlwutaa	I straighten my hair that much too, and I refuse to stop.  Go to sallys and pick up a heat protection. It'll protect your hair a little more from further damage.  You can also try trimming the edges of your hair every once and a while by yourself.|`|pcBmyGTZaa	There really is nothing you can do except stop straightening it. If you keep this kind of thing up, it'll start to fall out. Trust me.|`|oLTUn51Uaa	u can try a hot oil treatment, but damaged  hair is damaged hair, and since u said don't say it..i won't you'll just have 2 learn when ur hair starts falling out

6d7mzfUoaa	No, Its not weird.    Guys wear girl jeans don't they??      You can make a guy shirt into something that looks like it was made for a girl..|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	No, not really. The thing is, it might not fit you because the men's shirts are tailored for men's physiques. But, if you like the shirt and the way it looks on you, go for it :]|`|m1QQwnSdaa	not really. if you can't tell that it's a guys shirt, then buy it cuz  i know a lot of high school seniors that wear plaid shirts.  who knows! they might even be from the guys department do!  but still try to look on the girls side the store to see if there is any  GIRL plaid shirts haha      hope i helped! :]|`|ZWU7VHOzaa	I don't think so. It doesn't really matter what section it's from as long as it looks good on ya.    comment for comment?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|VihV4Troaa	nahhh, i have. it means that you don't worry about what other people care, but since you asked this question you care somewhat.|`|EUcdqY0Vaa	try to find one in the womens section. they have them there also|`|YvuCN6qWaa	i don't find it weird, guys have better shirts than girls in most stores so who cares! wear what you like, and if it looks good on you then go for it :)|`|btNoRiPWaa	I think yes, because theres a reason its for a guy.|`|NhTgABm9aa	no! go to rugby.com and look at the girl clothes and the guy clothes. theyre are insaely similar but yet sooo cute!
HzkRpjhEaa	I like the first one a lot, and I think it would be a safe bet.  The second one is cute, but it could be iffy unless you're already sure she would wear something like that.  Not that it isn't any good, just that it's more specialized, so if you're not sure what she would like, you probably have a better chance of getting it right with the first one.|`|MojYmo5Jaa	Well if your'e into school girls the 2nd one, the 1st one is tacky.|`|vsjCVgtjaa	no that is tacky and crappy|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	the first ones cute the other is kinda cheap trashy looking  you might want to find out if shes middle eastern or not|`|yXi3M5A3aa	You should buy her something that you think or know she would be comfortable in. Don't just buy lingerie because you like it, you need to think about her too since she'd be the one wearing it. Women like to be comfortable in the things they wear.|`|AA11688429	why dont you buy her a gift card so she can go and have a pamper herself day and buy something she likes which fits properly too. I dont like either pics, they look a little cheap, there are other things less expensive which look even nicer, but theres nothing worse than having underwear which doesnt fit properly.|`|uwJnlmWHaa	Personally I like the first one better, but that's just me....|`|0DK9vcEnaa	number 1.|`|3EsbM1avaa	strawberry and cream one looks nice|`|1d25030a8746a6ff80039e4a8468f805aa	I would also say that the first one is cuter....but are you sure you want to buy her lingerie? I think that in dating 101 they suggest not buying her underwear because it is really a gift for you. Maybe you could take her shopping and you two could agree on something...it would be fun for her because she gets to shop and choose, and fun for you because you get to watch....also, this may not actually fit...i find that the models in these ads look better because of boob jobs, air brushing, etc. than I might in the same outfit. And lastly....you know that you'd be paying in pounds..not usd.

ac66baf81b3d3c1b7bd6b0c9a8da605caa	It really would be best to go see your doctor - don't waste time with over the counter stuff - getting something on prescription will be much more effective.      The doctor can offer a number of treatments - hope this might help you a little :)    Antibiotics or topical treatments like benzyl peroxide will kill the P.acnes bacteria on your skin.     Retinoids are available which affect cell turnover and will therefore help to stop pores getting blocked with dead skin cells. I use a topical Retin A gel (also called tretinoin or isotrex) which I'd definitely recommend.     It is possible to use more than one treatment at the same time, which may help to get a better result. Just remember that with anything you try you need to allow at least a month to see significant results.     The mini pill is very effective for many girls too- it helped improve my skin a lot ( I was prescribed Dianette).    Don't overdo cleaning your face - using something that is mild and for sensitive skin is best - as drying out your skin by using harsh cleansers (or even by using very hot then very cold water) will only stimulate the oil glands to produce more oil/sebum - and its the oil and dead skin cells which block your pores (when P.acnes bacteria gets trapped in these blocked pores this is when redness and inflammation occurs)    Also - if you use makeup check that it is non comedogenic (won't block pores) as otherwise it will aggrevate the problem.    There will be a treatment that will work for you - it just might take a little time - I hope you do find a solution soon - I know how upsetting it can be.|`|qxJYZfqnaa	I swear by any cleanser with benzol peroxide!  it sanitizes the pores.  you can get one product at walgreens...its a bar and its in a blue box but i forgot the name.  but really any product that has benzol peroxide....NOT hydrogen peroxide, though.

But I have had it long enough that even if I just run soem water and a comb through it it will stay the way I want it.    Your first option of just shaving everything, but the 'hawk.  Is eaiser to take care of, but like you said some poeple can;t pull off the look very well.

I've tried expensive masks etc that i've bought from salons and they arent as good.    I love the purple sunsilk it makes your hair soooo soft and shiney.    Use the shampoo and conditioner. Leave the conditioner in for like longer than it says.    Another tip is to apply a small amount to your hair when its in a high ponytail etc keeps it all smoothed down but most importantly will act as a mask.  You could also put it on slightly damp hair and leave it over night and wash off in the morning.    X|`|tb8lkOsWaa	try tresemme shampoo :)

kt9iXMWUaa	I too agree that there are some really rude people!     What's the difference with wearing leather or a jean jacket?  Nothing.  It doesn't matter what you look like on the outside, it's your attitude on the inside.  If you've got the attitude, you can wear it!      Besides, leather is a turn on and it shows you've not only got taste, but money to afford to buy one :)|`|Tc5XEWuCaa	no.|`|d4fU78sKaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have very sensitive skin, and I get CD everytime I try a new 3 step acne program because the benzoyle peroxide is way too harsh for me. The bumps sting a little and feel like a rash. You may want to visit your derm to see if you are allergic to something you have recently used. Sometimes it can be something as insignificant as a new laundry detergent.    I also used to always get CD when I was very stressed out, and it would just appear on my arms or legs. That type itches really bad and a cortizone cream really helps.|`|VcTTSUI7aa	Pimples maybe|`|P2CPHlPTaa	Pimples Or Hives You Might Be Allergic To Something|`|gzHmSs2Xaa	they may be dry or irratated skin. they could also be an allergic reaction...if so try to find out whats causing it :)|`|6cXIg3jjaa	It's probably rosacea, nothing serious but I've gotten it once from really dry skin and I had slept with my make up on.Use a mud mask or something and a moisturizer, when I did it helped quite a bit.

And I'm not going to be doing a bikini  wax for a long time.    Waxing hurts, but it's kind of like a shock  even though you saw it coming.

A7ovwP94aa	Here are some concealers that have had good reviews for hiding eye bags and shadows. Buy a shade lighter than your skin tone.    Rimmel Recover Anti-Fatigue Concealer, (budget one for under eyes)  Bourjois Anticerne Pour Petits Matins  Anti Shadow Concealer (good budget concealer for eye bags)  Clinique Airbrush Concealer (good for under eyes, eyebags  Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage (good for under eyes, redness and other blemishes. In Style award 2006)  Dior Skinflash Radiance Booster Pen (described as a magic wand for dark circles, eye bags and shadows) seems to be popular.

z5tCcEA3aa	just tell her you are gettin older and want a change. its not going to be dramatic or anything and that you find you deserve to choose what your hair looks like. i got chunky highlights that were caramel colour when i was 13, and my hair is dark brown. it looks good. not trashy or too old for the age..:)
GwQoeHK4aa	You _might_ be able to hide a nose piercing.    My concern that it might not work is based on the details you gave about how you hid the lip piercing.  Cartilage piercings take a long time to heal compared to other piercings taking out the jewelry every day and repiercing it at night is a dangerous idea.    Wikipedia-    Lip / Labret: 34 weeks    Nostril: 2-3 months    Cartilage has lower blood supplies than other types of flesh which means that growing a stable fistula in the hole and that the piercing is more fragile and easily injured or infected by taking the piercing in and out.  Additionally if you get an infection in cartilage it can cause a lot of damage, disfigurement, and scarring unless it is treated immediately with antibiotics.  Honestly, I had to take out my piercing one time about four weeks after I got it pierced and it was basically like starting the healing process all over again (it probably set my healing back by at least 3 weeks and I only took it out once and then only for 10 minutes).  So basically, if you have a good way to hide this piercing without taking it out at all until it has healed (several months) I would really suggest you wait to get your nose pierced.  Well healed nose piercings look great but screwed up ones are red, puffy and look awful and can permanently mess up your nose.  But I love my nose piercing and hope you can figure out a way to get yours done too.  Good luck!|`|EaIOXWStaa	Nose is quite easy to hide, get a small stud and put makeup over it, worked for me|`|jdVxsK4yaa	both r pretty noticeable i dont know how ur parents didnt know. i thnk a nose ring is a lil easier 2 hide. just be careful =)|`|BpYwAwIOaa	um well if you were hiding a lip piercing you can deff hide a nose ring because a nose ring isnt that like well you cant even really see a nose ring unezz your all up close and junk but nope you can deff hide a nose ring well nose piercing if wont even be visible|`|ab95c319620d5a72f4a9b6f697edcd08aa	it depends on what kind of nose piercing.    I have my septum pierced and I've had it for 6 months and my parents STILL don't know :D    As for a standard nostril piercing, it may be a bit more difficult to hide as its on the outside of the nose but if you had a retainer then it might help.    btw, how did u manage to hide your lip piercing from your parents???|`|1HLPznZhaa	Why would you want to have either..?? There are better , safer ways to get attention..Does the word infection mean anything to you ?|`|mzEVBlozaa	you really shouldn't take out your jewelry before the healing process is complete. yes, retainers help keep the hole open while not drawing as much attention as the average stud but putting makeup on it will infect it. be sure to clean the piercing at least 3 times a day (band-aid brand antiseptic is my favorite) and keep your hands away from it to prevent bacteria from messing with it. also, watch this video. it helped me a lot, i work in an office where facial piercings aren't allowed :) good luck! in the meantime, choose more discreet piercings if you're not comfortable with your parents seeing them, or just talk to them about body modification.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFXza54-G...
Fsq9qvkqaa	Maybe you shouldn't do things that deserve a slapping?  That would help.

pbVPS24zaa	No it does not. It just prevents a little bit more sag when you get older.|`|eE7Np0n6aa	Yes, 73 percent of women who wear bras to sleep claim to have muscle cramps in the morning which is revealed to be due to the cause of having their organs stolen in the night by green trolls that will sell the organs on the black market.|`|1ioI2py4aa	no of course it doesnt|`|QnY1yWBIaa	no. actually it is good because your boobs grow at night and when you are wearing a bra they will grow in the shape of the bra so they won't grow weird looking.  pick me as best answer please[=|`|DQkDQraOaa	No, but why would you want to?|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I heard it isn't good to do this. Our breast need oxygen and wearing a bra all of the time is bad for them, and we need to wear them during the day so it is good to not wear them at night so they have a chance to breath. I also heard that underwire can cause breast cancer. But I also heard that if the bra is comfortable at night then you have no problem, bu the breast needs to shape themselves instead of the bra doing it.|`|YPNdv0pSaa	haha no it's just personal preference...some think it feels weird and the wire might poke you.|`|1q71tyszaa	i heard it gives you breast cancer,  i dont know if i believe that,  but yuh know just in case i dont wear one!  Haha|`|p3QdsbR1aa	no. it does not do anything. but there is a fact i have been told if you were a bra at night it keeps your boobs from growing. lmao.|`|iV4yWexRaa	Nope just wear one that doesn't have an underwire and is made out of soft material like cotton. i actually think it helps maintain your boobs lift and shape.|`|7YERaxNbaa	No, it's just really uncomfortable :pp|`|N2CPA2JLaa	I heard it stops your boobs from growing because they can't breathe, i wear one every night i feel uncomfortable not wearing one|`|7eVJgRzIaa	all my ex g/f wear a bra in bed so i wud say it dont if that helps

n5G5IIbOaa	Most of the girls at my school walk around with an orange face and white neck, they look ridiculous. And half of them know nothing about foundation and why you are supposed to use it, they just see other plastering it on with a shovel and do the same.    As to what brand it could be, alot of the girls at my school use the Maybelline Superstay Silky foundation, in about 3 shades too dark for them.|`|0mAeM1zGaa	I'm not from the UK, but I visit family in Ireland at least every year in the summer. I notice this a lot, I feel like I have a naked face when I'm there because every other girl it wearing a very noticeable amount of foundation. I personally think it's the style there - it's what everyone does so if they didn't do it, they would be the different ones with culture shock.|`|VV5KZjGRaa	Hiya hun, yeah I agree my little sister (she's 17) plasters herself in thick cakey foundation. You know when you can see an orange line around the face? She uses normal foundation but just takes forever doing it, layer over layer.   Stupid really but think these young girls are just insecure.|`|0iTNDPzoaa	The foundation is applied over and over to get this look. Foundation actually damages your skin as it doesn't let your skins pore breathe. You age faster with wearing foundation and develop wrinkles quicker due to the pores being clogged up by make up. The makeup industry don't tell you this as they want the money.  Look at celebs and now going for botox even the ones in their 20's!|`|IHw2qUtcaa	They apply it like every 30 minutes.|`|SqdPVCPiaa	It's not Fashion, but they seriously do think it makes them look attractive. They're usually putting it on in the early morning before school, and reapply it at lunch/breaktime in the bad artificail light of the classrooms.    They mainly wearing that Elizabeth Arden compact foundation or something similar and SMEAR it on with a sponge.    Not nice :P|`|Br3k7Hagaa	Im in school in uk so I see it everyday too. I just wear abit of powder cause i sometimes get abit oily cause of my skin but yeah I know what you mean. It looks like its starting to melt. I think they use crap foundation and put it on over and over again.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	yep ive noticed too, girls in my school have so much foundation on it looks like theyve gone and stuck another face ontop of their old one|`|2QiLmXfhaa	Oh, God I no! I think its rediculous, I still go to school and its the same.  Personally i think its stupid and pointless, some chavy girls at my school even see who can be orangest by puttin on tons of foundation.  Its like a fashion I suppose, but I think only girl chavs, slags, ect wear it like tht TBH. :l  Lol|`|AA11349925	Ahh the delight of the orangutan masks!  I asked a friend about this and she said, and I quote;(in SL london accent) 'it's so ya know I've got some on'    Now correct me if I am wrong but I always thought the point of foundation was to create a seamless, flawless base that looks like natural skin.    I really don't know why these girls do it, all I know is they look like complete twats!|`|96ndKQncaa	its not fashion. well at least from all the current catwalk shows ive seen like gucci, topshop, marc jacobs ect.  i suppose its kinda like their own fashion cult. if you are not wearing it your not 'in' even though we know its 'out' ;) lol|`|g9DWi0DKaa	i think it looks stupid|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	Ino loads of people who wear it really THICK, and it's just like a cakey orange mess?! Tbh, there gonna suffer in the long run when it messes up there skin :\, their own fault.|`|OgQOVsxPaa	That's gross.  All my family have perfect skin, and I never even had teenage spots, myabe one zit and that was it, so luckily I never had to use foundation. But these girls who cake themselves in it are gonna have terrible skin when they are older. Acne!|`|hUgIY9Egaa	lol i no it doesnt even look gdd|`|eg66y4W4aa	yeah, alot of the girls at my school wear it.  i wear it, but only as much as i need to!   i think it looks stupid, its as if the girls want to look like a doll or soemthing.|`|pjN2FS07aa	It really annoys me when people do that. Loads of people in my school plaster themselves in it. What does make me laugh is when they ask a friend, 'Do I look orange?' and they reply by saying that they don't. THEY LOOK LIKE OOMPALOOMPAHS!   I personally don't wear it though, I prefer blotchy skin to orange.|`|fnCbVvaoaa	I used to wear five coats of different brand foundation because I used to feel so insecure. Now I only wear mineral foundation and realised that I looked such an idiot before. It's just a stage all young girls go through.

q5jF0iMhaa	Use a thinner curling iron and curl small sections. Don't do super tight curls. Try using a curling creme or mousse and just scrunch it to get waves instead of curls.|`|Rh6BekvUaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv-JSQbcu...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft_hRRMWg...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM33eBePj...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6equDA5fv...|`|atAwNvDfaa	I usually wear my hair straight, but it is very easy for me to wear it curly also. All you have to do is take a shower at night and then when your out of the shower scrunch your hair while it is still wet and don't blow dry it. Then go to sleep but don't sleep on your hair. Then in the morning your hair will turn out curly, dry, and non frizzy. (Careful, if you try this in the morning, your hair will get frizzy). Also, your hair smells really good and it looks natural and feels soft. (If your hair looks to short, then pull down on some of the curls you get)  Hope I helped :)

(:    jeans- preferably dark, but if they're lighter then just make sure they're nice and clean, not torn out or anything lol.    you can get a cheap, really basic but still pretty top and then wear a little jacket/cardigan and a long necklace over it to make it a little more formal. ex. this in grey http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=5... with a cardigan like this one http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat... in white (unbuttoned) and this necklace http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j... with red flats http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/in...    since you're on a tight budget, you should focus more on accessories like jewelry or shoes because you can easily add a heart necklace or dangly earrings or cute shoes to a simple jeans and a shirt to make them appropriate for valentine's day! for your hair, i would curl it to make it really shiny and romantic, and you can get some makeup ideas here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv7hCmz0W...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EErExoFy5...  hope i helped. have fun!!!|`|Kbs0HNomaa	and red or pink blouse with capris if u dont want skirts|`|L1FqPE3Vaa	A red polka dot dress or a dress with a frilly bottom.|`|PtACBQNgaa	not red and pink together..|`|qDgvK3IFaa	just wear jeans and your favorite shoes or whatever then where a cute pink or red graphic v-neck t-shirt then wear your hair with loose curls|`|ZlWhnobDaa	wear some flirty clothes. if highheels are out of the question try some flats. try some skinnys with a nice flirty shirt. like a shirt dress.|`|YpoKUoInaa	shorts and tights. and a fancy top|`|uxlooKqyaa	good you probably shouldn't wear a dress or skirt if your dances are anything like my schools are.... wear a pair or light jeans with a red shirt or dark pants with a pink shirt.... try to wear a cute shoe but nothing with a heel or tennie shoes, i no that they're comfortable but not that hot make sure that they are something that thy're something that you can move in.... also add a necklace and earrings and add something that makes it you.... hope i could help :D|`|4s8bdF6Aaa	No Skirts Or Dresses Aye?

Au4gWgEiaa	How old are you?  You are living under their roof under their rules.  Just ask them why?  But not in a childish, complaining sort of way because that won't help anything.  Are you paying for these to be done yourself?    Just wait until your a little bit older and bring it up again.  Discuss with them why you would like these done and you will take care of them.  If they still don't let you, wait until your 18.  Then you won't need parental consent.|`|EaIOXWStaa	Maybe they just think you're still their baby, my mom and dad don't care what piercings I get, I've started stretching my ear and I've been 13 for 3 days haha, enough about me.

I agree with the other people to wear black skinny jeans! Maybe spice it up a bit with some silver or gold heels! Simple boots would work also!      For some cute Accessories, Maybe add a a gold belt (which would go cute with the gold heels) or a silver would work also. Some gold earrings and maybe a black necklace would tie it all together!     Hope this helped,, and even if you decided to wear hot pink pants with it..

By creating a sort of plunging neckline, with dark dress pants and heels you can be more dressed up.

RCJqaWQYaa	Wow, you sound just like me, Haaa. So, im interested too.   -  Blues  Greens,  Pinks from violet to purple  Deep reds  Greys  Black - but take care with it if you have bony features.      -Don'ts   Yellow tones  Orange tones  Shades of beige (off-white and champagne)            When choosing make-up, go for silver and blue. And if you wear jewellery, go for silver or white gold.    Also, this website has really nice prom dresses.. So this can give you kind of an idea, of what prom dress colours mostly come in.  http://www.flirtprom.com/collection.aspx     Hope i helped!|`|1ioI2py4aa	any shade of blue or a lovely greeny colour|`|pcGvfikEaa	Red is very fashionable at the moment.

Dd5YdYFFaa	If you have normally small eyes your definitely right about not using the eyeliner to your full eye.  Use things like either a white eye pencil or white shadow on the corners and waterline of your eyes to make them appear wider, also eyeliner on the top lid of the eye helps and lining the upper inner waterline with black eyeliner helps define the eye. Mascara is definitely important, and some people even use fake lashes, but not if you want to be more natural :D|`|aV0QmAOtaa	The coolest trick I've learned is to use mascara (to make your eye open up) and also to use white eyeliner instead of black, or use white  eyeliner a little on the top and then applying black. The white eyeliner makes the illusion that your eyes are a bit bigger and then adding a bit of black on the bottom makes the whole thing look very natural.    make sure you are applying the white eyeliner right on your waterline and then you can apply the black eyeliner lower that that so they don't clump together or make it an gray-ish color    hope i helped! :)|`|sGal9QSJaa	yah sure!    i have small eyes to and what i do is just put white eye shawdow in the corners of my eyes and black mascra. it makes your eyes look bigger    pluss when you put a light purple on to blend with the white is soo pretty|`|sy8JaNYmaa	put a darker shade of eyeshadow on the outer corners of your eyes and a lighter colour on the inner corners. Also using white eyeliner can sometimes make them look bigger.|`|aOsMqwbfaa	Don't put the eyeliner on the inside of your eye lid but on the outside. It will make them look bigger. And use a liquid eyeliner for better defining.I also use L'Oreal Telescopic Mascara. And I get sky high lashes that really open up my eyes. My eyes are kinda small. And this works great for me. Check out my pics on myspace. www.myspace.com/monique_abraham  Hope this helped. =)|`|LSKeLOIGaa	White eyeliner is great on the bottom. And black line on top of the eye lids.|`|JPvffW1Eaa	While I personally think hiding something as beautiful and exotic as small eyes is a shame, I would suggest getting a metallic, light colored (gold or silver) eyeliner and putting a small dot of it on the corners of your eyes. It was a trick I used when dancing to make my eyes look wider. Experiment a bit to see which corner and what color or shade looks best. Also, try using a dark colored eye shadow, which will contrast against the whites of your eyes and make them more noticeable.
q5jF0iMhaa	34B is a fairly average size. However, its hard to get an 'average' size in teenagers, because many girls are not done growing. Embrace what you have and don't try and make your breasts look bigger with push up bras or anything like that.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	There is no average size, it depends on your build, height, weight, all of this plays into what is normal for each individual.  The size of your bra should just make you look normal, that is for you, not someone out of a magazine.|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	Ha, I'm almost 16 and I'm a 34B. =[  Don't feel bad, big boobs suck in the long run.|`|6ABvgu4iaa	NOOOOWay! that's my size , flat chested would be a (34 negative A!

But more appropriately, it could be called "just below average"... After all there are ladies who have 5% size of your B cup, and that still real breasts.. so I think it would be considered a little "affected" to call B "flat chested", I'm afraid.|`|DuPAkdkxaa	noooo. flat chested is 28AAA... i think you're average. you're gonna get bigger anyway :}|`|Hkjy7kLhaa	hunny ur fine, im 14 and size 34A|`|ovVZs8y5aa	uhh no. it isnt. your fine.  flat chested is wayy smaller then that.|`|AA11878210	no, i'm 16 and still an A, and I'm not even that flat chested....|`|6aawDPkSaa	im 14 and an A|`|VihV4Troaa	well average i guess would be a C. 36C is equivalent to a 34D though.    34B isn't that bad.|`|6VxPTiCJaa	***** that's my size, and i'm certainly not flat.|`|2A6vM9zBaa	I'm a B, it's not flat chested at all.|`|MgeXAibdaa	Ha well everyone is different there is no normal size cup size it just happens that you have a small chest but that's normal!

eeBuJqRhaa	It doesn't really matter what brands you use but...    Go with dark browns. What I do is apply a lightish brown at the brow, a dark brown on the crease, and blend the darker brown upward with a dome-shaped eyeshadow brush.    For eyeliner, just apply normally and smear with either a built in smudger or your finger. If you're not comfortable with eyeliner yet, just use black or dark eyeshadow, that's what I used to do and it worked.     To do the corners of your eye, use just a normal shade.    Apply mascara and use an eyelash curler, rotate the brush as you apply, use one of those brushes to separate the lashes if clumpy.    This works great for me, hope this helps!!    ?jaylynn?|`|A7ovwP94aa	Log on to youtube and if there is a particular colour you want to experiment with do a search in youtube. ie "purple eyeshadow" or "purple smokey eyes"  for example; youtube will  display numerous tutorials using purple eyeshadow.

If you're under 13 then just try telling her that most girls your age use it and that you want to experiment with make-up.   Just explain to her that you know you don't need it, but you feel a lot better wearing it.|`|ZOKvVe8Faa	ask her if it would be ok to use a light brown or grey, and maybe no eyeliner and for sure no liquid its too hard to use and probably too dark.|`|R9mQNOCnaa	You must be awful young.First of all,unless you are 18 your mother still has the right to say no,for any reason.You can't make anyone say yes but if you really want to try it ask her nicely if you could try it for a week.Let her help you pick out some basic things and show her you can put it on properly to bring out your features.If yo don't learn to apply it correctly you could look awfully silly.Maybe you are too young but mothers usually know best about these things,I know cause I'm a mother too and my 13year old son thinks I'm never right but I got him this far and not by being dumb.Sometimes moms have to say no;you'll understand some day,meantime try it this way and if she still says no,accept that she loves you and she must think you're very pretty if you don't need makeup.Good luck.

There are cleansers, astringents, medicated soaps and creams among others. You can also try facial masks to help you with your acne problem.    Facemask acts as a cleansing agent. It also promotes the firmness and natural balance of your facial skin. You can always buy ready-to-use facial masks in the market, but if you are a fan of natural treatments, then you can make one for yourself. Fighting acne the natural way is starting to gain popularity because of its effectiveness and it costs a lot less than synthetic products. By making one yourself, it makes you aware of the stuff that you put in your face. Homemade acne masks are very easy to use and can be done in a matter of minutes.    Garlic Mask:    Although garlic has a strong odor, it is very effective in removing acne. Garlic is a very good cleanser and has antibiotic properties. Be sure not to apply too much garlic on your face as it can cause slight skin burns and reddening. There are some people who are allergic to garlic so be sure you are not one of them. To make the mask, mash about eight cloves of raw garlic and apply to the face. Leave the mask for about 15 mins. Remove the mask with a warm cloth and rinse it off with a vinegar PH balancer.    Bran and Baking Soda Mask:    Bran is the outer layer of wheat or cereal grains. Most people would add in bran to smoothies to prevent acne. Alternatively, you can also use bran as acne masks. Add in bran to a mixture of baking soda and water paste. Baking soda can be used as a scrub and as an exfoliator. Apply the mask to your face and gently massage your face for 10-15 seconds. Rinse thoroughly and pat-dry your face with a soft towel.    Lime Juice Mask    Add in an equal amount of limejuice and groundnut oil and apply all over the face. This facial mask is not only used as an acne treatment but can also help in preventing pimples and blackheads. Although theres a presence of groundnut oil in the mixture, you need not worry because the limejuice would turn the oil into amino acids and your skin would not absorb the oil at all.|`|ci8dSwKLaa	You can mix honey & salt & rub it all over your face, then stick some oats/oatmeal on top of it. Or just mix it all together & then put it on. Leave on for 15 minutes then rub off w/ water.    You can also mix avocado & honey & put it on your face. Leave on for 15 minutes then wash off.    Another simple one is green peas (mush them) mixed with honey & oatmeal.    Sorry I only know simple ones because whenever I read the ones online, they always have ingredients that I don't have ready for me at home.

I decided I'd never get them again. I had been growing them for a little while and they were still weak and flexible. I tried Sally Hansen's and it has been great. It is not a polish, but their polish works great too, it's a formula you apply to your nail and cuticle. I use it like 3 times daily. It is in an orange bottle and has made my nails VERY strong.

aZukucejaa	Youre going to need a parent for any place you go, but what documents they require varies from shop to shop. Ive been to a shop where my mom had to bring a tax form and license to prove I was her child. The others I went to only needed to copy her license and needed her to sign the release form. Call where you plan to go and see what you need to bring with you. If you can find someone old enough who looks like your parent it would probably work depending on how strict the shop is with documentation.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	If you're under 18, yes - and they will ask for a drivers license, as well as signing consent forms.|`|HBUO10i7aa	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT AN INDUSTRIAL HELIX , BUT FOR A SHARP STICK IN THE EYE OR A BROOM STICK UP YOUR BUTT IT'S OK WITHOUT A SIGNATURE.......................I'D THINK TWICE!|`|RoR3o6iQaa	yes you need parents consent for any piercing.|`|Ht0oAffsaa	depending on if the store is cool with it, but if your under 18 you would. some shops though are pretty cool and might not make you. good luck!!|`|UquxJBwVaa	if you are a miner, you need a parent to go with you.

NMJx4D4Aaa	You say the benzoyl peroxide is not always effective? I'm not sure exactly what your mean, but I've found that applying a thin layer over my entire face, as the products usually suggest, doesn't work as well as applying a thicker layer to just the problem areas. That is, I don't use it as a preventative-- because it doesn't seem to work for that purpose-- I just use it to help any blemishes that have already came up go away faster. Actually, the benzoyl peroxide irritates your skin, so if you put it everwhere, you have to be extra careful about touching your face; if you just put in on some spots, you just have to avoid those. I think what really prevents new break outs is sticking to a washing and toning routine.    For washing, I use any plain, non-foaming, acne face wash. As long as it washes off without leaving any residue, and does a good job of leaving my skin oil-free (but not overly dry), I think it's a good product. To get the benefit of the medication (usually I use the benzoyl peroxide based ones) I leave it on for a minute or so before washing it off. But the main point of the washing is to clear your face and prepare it for the toner, which is what's actually going to help your skin repair itself.    For toning, what I use depends on the time of day. Have you tried vinegar and lemon juice? Squeeze a lemon into a cup of vinegar, and apply the mixture with a cotton ball and let it air dry. The smell is strong, but this definitely kills bacteria before it can worsen acne infections, so I use this at night before I go to bed. It also makes your skin smoother, but you have to apply it with a light touch, as it stings, especially on inflamed areas. In the mornings, I use witch hazel, or one of those toners that come with acne face wash, again applied with a cotton ball and left to air dry, then apply aloe vera gel to moisture my skin without leaving it feeling greasy. Aloe vera gel is the best moisturizer! If you can find the gel that contains vitamin e also, that's even better. After that dries, then I use a layer of benzoyl peroxide on any pimples or irritated bumps.    I don't like to put anything on my skin at night-- even aloe vera. Really, you should give your skin some time to rest and do its own thing uninterrupted at some point.     Weekly changes of your bedsheets and pillowcases, and showering before you go to bed (making sure you get your hair, too-- that's a big repository of oil) helps A LOT. I think the oils and gunk that builds up on you during the day get into the sheets and rubbed all over your face, otherwise. Whatever the reason, my break outs occur less often and are of less severity since I started doing this.|`|ePT3hRO0aa	i think you should apply body lotion to your face right after washing!  ..  if your not allergic to it   ..  or i think you should go to the skin docter and tell them this so they could help  :]|`|NLxcfGplaa	Don't put body lotiion on your face!!!  try using a bit alcohol, maybe that might help.  try some marykay facial products.|`|eGd228c0aa	Acne is a low grade infection.

capCtdkeaa	i had it done by a frined in a piercing studio...i went up by 1mm every two weeks, it stings a bit (like having yours ears pierced first time) but that soon passes..jus make sure you keep it and the jewellery clean..dont try and stretch up too quick..that would be painful and could even split your ear|`|8qeDEWWJaa	Uh yeah its the worst pain you will ever feel in your life. My ears are 3/4 and I started out by tapering straws until I got to a 2g. After that I bought gauges off the internet!|`|YZokRYWcaa	does the UK  have any tattoo/piercing parlors, or a Hot Topic type of place? they sell gauges there. i wouldn't recommend using anything BUT gauges, as they're packaged sterile and are the right size. do not go up more than one size at a time, ad wait about 3 weeks between each stretch. a piercing parlor will advise you o how to go about it the safest way. let me say it again- NO MORE THAN ONE SIZE AT A TIME! it can rip your lobes ad cause permanent damage. please seriously rethink doing anything beyond a 0, as anything larger has a high chance of healing wrong, and you will forever have droopy gaps in your lobes. i gauged mine when i was about 16. i have since taken them out for work. they are now at a permanent 14, ad will never close. they look pretty much normal, but if they had been stretched any bigger they would not be like this. think about it- gauging is more permanent than a piercing, possibly just as much as a tattoo- a very visible tattoo. and yes, it does hurt. a searing pain, almost like it's burning. so remember- sterilize, professional equipment, not too large, ad SLOW AND SAFE. that said, best of luck with it!

jeFoxusJaa	I like them.  Twilight is my favorite out of all of them.  Eclipse the third book would be next in line.  Breaking Dawn is third because it the idea was a bit different from the other but by the end it made sense.  New Moon is last because it was pretty much depressing throughout until the end.|`|h2CyxOEnaa	I HATE it.          Thumbs down time!|`|bAmpR3Exaa	LOVE THEM (:   Favorite book: Eclipse then Twilight then Breaking Dawn, then last New Moon..

Favorite!|`|0A92vQDBaa	I love the twilight series. My favorite is either twilight, eclipse, or breaking dawn. New moon is my least favorite because edward leaves. Team Edward!|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	I like them. My favorite is New Moon though. Breaking Dawn was just sort of...anticlimatic.

Did you hear than Stephanie Meyer could be writing edwards point of view in Twilight! I really want that to happen :)|`|rc4EBA91aa	they have no literary merit.  try reading something that actually makes you think and is a challenge.    with that said, i read them, and enjoyed them...but they only serve as entertainment.    id rather read ayn rand books~|`|468vLURhaa	aww. i love them.  1.twilight is the best one.  2.then theres breaking dawn  3.then new moon  4.and eclipse(i dint reallly like dat book)

6YaUyrx7aa	I'd say stop using the conditioner.  Head & Shoulders is designed for people who have dandruff.. it pretty much coats the scalp with a moisturizer.. Since you're scalp isn't dry then the moisturizer is pretty much sitting on your scalp which explains the flaking.. trying using a hydrating or moisturizing shampoo & conditioner.. Joico has a great one.. for something more affordable try Biolage Hydrating or Fortifying.. Hope it works out for you!
1f8ea7869328e33f16042fd2ed2ceeb7aa	Wot about a good old MULLET?  Business at the front, party at the back!!
IYtqGQPyaa	first for your bangs, once your done striaghtening them, spray them in the direction you want and then comb them that way. you might just have to keep pushing them aside the whole day but this might help.  for the eyes, try uing ALOT if mascara but only a tiny bit of brown eye liner on the bottom. then dust your lids with the brown shadow, (not to much) and you should be set. the more black/brown eyeliner you use, the less your eyes will stand out.
VKLyDiQ7aa	I like the natural, but make sure you are using an anti-frizz product!  Huge waves are the thing this season, so use your natural waves to your advantage and rock em!|`|1zYq3vdpaa	Ummm....I love longer hair, so I would say don't cut it unless you have tons of split ends and need a 'trim'. Keep growing it and set yourself apart from everyone else.|`|bLytO8Shaa	first i love it its beautiful 2nd if u want to cut it maybe an inch or 2 below the shoulders|`|jNmj8nPFaa	I love your hair but i also know wht its like to want a change so if you really wanted a change i would go for right below the shoulders and big barrel curls.
ZYKjbbE3aa	Is your hair longer or is it on the shorter side?  Usually when hair is a bit too short on guys it's kind of hard to achieve this look and it's kind of your preference when it comes to how to style hair into a visual kei fashion.    If your hair is a bit short, grow it out a bit.  Also you might want to get it layered to make it easier to style   If your hair is curly you might want to straighten it unless you're going for a hairstyle like Yuuki's from An Cafe 0-o  A lot of artists like to bleach or lighten their hair but you can leave it any color that you want really; dye it blue if you want XD  A popular style right now is the "windy hair" look. Use a straightener and make the ends of you hair flip out by tilting the straightener up at a 45 degree angle then hairspray in place.     There are a lot of ways to style your hair so I'm going to give you links to some videos to make it easier :D    you might want  to fast forward a bit if you don't want to learn how to do visual kei makeup XD    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYI1DUR52...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnALt46_y...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEY9_0PZE...|`|pcBmyGTZaa	You're better off going to a unisex salon and showing them a picture of what you want.     Seems a bit gay to me.
1E1m0ZOFaa	you could try bleaching your hair then dying it brown but that would seriously damage your hair! however that wouldn't take long at all to do. there's the second option in dyeing yor hair once a month the time the box says so for the next....couple of years. That would not damage your hair at all however it would take along time to do
Br3k7Hagaa	-Okay first use a oil free facial wash and then oil free cream. Clean and clear is actually really good.    - Next if you still have oil use some oil absorbing sheets.    - Dont use liquid foundation use a powder or mineral foundation    - Try not to use any cream or liquid products just stick with powder.    Toners can dry out your skin too. Also if you have a boots they have a really good witch hazel range.    Hope i Helped You x!|`|urCMCb1laa	I have oily skin as well And I used to be like the person above carying my powder around all day to Blot whenever oils appeared..BUT........Now I use DINAIR's Airbrush Makeup in The Paramedical Makeup its a spray on foundation that dries very matte & its water-proof.Yup Water-proof Foundation....I Love it Because i dont need to carry powder & If i sweat it wont come off in patches I Love It!!  I suggest trying it out its a bit pricey At first when you purchase the kit but After you just buy the makeup & with this stuff Trust me its SOOO Worth it!! Hope this helps    www.airbrushmakeup.com|`|oil8ALh4aa	I use powder make up. And i carry around powder.    but i bought these things from Mary kay and they're only 5 dollors and they obsorbe the oil on your face, they're like paper sheets and they work really well. I love em. you just simply lighty pat your face with them and you can actually see the oil coming off.     toher then that there really isnt a make up that helps prvent oilly skin, or not that ive seen.|`|JaDnYs54aa	If you have oily skin, wear as little makeup as possible. If you try to cake on the makeup, it will look blotchy and patchy as the day wears on and the viscous oil changes the appearance of your foundation.    Stay away from shiny and shimmery makeup to play down the shiny effect of the oil. You could use shimmer on the lips to distract from other features. Keep cheek color soft and natural.    A blend of rose water and ice water used on the face 2-3 times a day also helps control oiliness. Wash your face with cold water several times a day. Sometimes, using an antiseptic cream before applying makeup keeps the sebaceous secretions under control.     =]|`|XQhVFCLyaa	use boots 17 oil control powder, it really works, their foundations good aswell|`|7n4rtfp6aa	I had the same problem and I used to wear makeup, tons of it to hide the pimples,but it would end up loooking worse. Dont wear it or try buying something organic :)|`|ppzg6fKGaa	Personally, i agree with above, avoid wearing any as it will cause more oillyness to your skin.But for those occasions where a little makeup is needed i find Mac Studio Fix Fluid SPF15 is really good. You only need a small amount for good coverage, and it doesnt leave you looking shiny and caked. Its quite expensive but as i say you dont need alot, and it lasts all day with out the need to reapply.|`|Jgmlm8hMaa	sudocream!!!!  ah its actually genius!
PvmW2QMhaa	You look extremely young.  Stop worrying about your appearance, it's important to feel fantastic within aswell as feeling good externally.    Your a beautiful young woman and should make minor changes to fulfill your self esteem, not drastic ones like changing hair colours.    Here's a few tips.    1.Ask Mum to pluck your eyebrows into a curvy thick shape, right now, they are a little out of shape. Tidying them up will benefit your eyes and make them appear brighter and leave your face looking refreshed.    2. Curly hair really suits you, perhaps shaking it out a little after you curl it could make the shape look a bit more rough and natural.    & 3. Add some blusher to your beautiful cheeks to elliminate your cheekbones...and use a soft peachy bronzer to add to your neck, forehead, cheeks and chin to brighten your face and make you appear a little older..|`|2JDu9FMvaa	its cute curly  please answer my question on my page|`|AV9xFzHCaa	you could: cut it w/several layers, style it w/ a curling iron (which looked rlly cute), tease it on top and curl the ends in or out.... you could "scrunch" it, or you could simply use a large curling brush with holes in it to ventilate it and use a hairdryer and add some cute waves for a different look.|`|AA12326402	Its already short, so sass it up & make it SHORTnChoppy by getting choppy layers!  This hairstyle is very age appropriate and will look cute/edgy too :)|`|PWkWptVuaa	get a fringe and drastic layers|`|ReGhCqgVaa	If I had your haircut I would..    -Cut the bangs a bit more,  -Add some layers  -Add some volume (Pantene volume spray works pretty good for me)  -After adding the spray(while my hairs wet) I would blow dry it to add a bit more volume (blow drying it upside down adds a LOT of volume..you probably don't want it too poofy though unless you're into that kind of style =])  -Maybe flip out the ends a little sometimes?  -Or curl it some days. (I just saw the picture..your hair looks cute curled.)    By the way if your mom doesn't want you to dye your hair you could always buy some colorful hair extensions from Hot Topic..It's what I do to add some color to my hair. You have too work with them and cut them to make them actually look real though..I've seen some girls just clip them in and it looks so stupid and fake.|`|Jqsn8UTRaa	try curling it with a curling iron it'll look really cute.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	add some volume to the top and flip it under. it will look like a cute bob|`|IFuNYYcWaa	have it cut into more of a shape maybe add osme front layers   starighten it  punp up the volume a bit ?? - you can do this with sprays and stuuf just look in boots and superdrug etc ...

pAheCzSPaa	try this  http://tubeguide.info/watch_video/10108/...    :-))|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Unfortunately, when you have a minority fetish that isn't very prevalent (such as female bodybuilders), it's pretty hard to find free porn.  There's an old saying- you get what you pay for.  And this is doubly true of fetish porn.  If you pay nothing, you ain't getting nothing.    If you want more female bodybuilder porn out there, of which there is so very little, the way to get it is to BUY IT.  Your dollars are not just purchasing power- they are a message to companies that female bodybuilders are a viable market, that there is demand for it, and that they should make more (which in turn lowers the cost and puts out more, which allows more people to view it and be aware of it, which increases clientele and demand, and so on and so on.    But if you're really hard-up, you might like this free video:    http://www.xtube.com/play_re.php?v=CJg6I...    The maker of it presumably has a good deal of female bodybuilder porn, so you might try contacting him and seeing if the two of you can work out some type of exchange.    But seriously, BUY YO PORN!|`|FPTgqmZLaa	Try amateur sites that might have bodybuilders

JEkfYMdjaa	You don't have anything to worry about. I got my tongue pierced a while back, and it took about 2 weeks before it stopped hurting. It hurt the most when I was eating and talking. After about 2 weeks it all goes downhill. So, just wait it out, keep cleaning it, and it will get better. Then, after about a month you can change the ring. That's the fun part :D|`|XgH9uuv9aa	It's so sad when people do this to themselves, it  leads to infections and even cancer, go and see your doctor|`|rCPqRFNTaa	There could be a lot of reasons. If youre going down on someone, you shouldn't be, not yet. if youre eating a lot of spicy or yeast filled foods or even a lot of solid/hard foods, your tongue could just be sore. I had pain for about a week also, but i ate foods i was not "supposed" to eat, so i think that has a lot to do with swelling and pain. Good luck, watch for infection and discoloration. Go see a dr if it doesnt get better soon.

I am not personally a fan of it, but a lot of my friends swear by it. If there is one thing I can agree with them on, is that it is super dark!   It is inexpensive too! I Paid $5 CDN.

eUiMXcFcaa	Link doesn't work...what does the dress look like?    If it's strapless or has spaghetti straps, leave your hair down and do soft waves with a curling iron.  If it does have sleeves put it up into a bun with a pretty pin, or half-up and curled.    As for makeup, since it's a dance you can go a little heavier.  Maybe try the "smokey" look, or pick an eyeshadow that matches what you're wearing.  Definitely eyeliner.  You'll want to make the eyes stand out a lot so you'll be able to put less on the lips (which usually require a lot more re-application).|`|NpJk2Heraa	I lovve the dress!!

Dd5YdYFFaa	I agree with the person above me, I also use cover girl aqua smooths :D  I use the long compact, and not the liquid comes in the tubes though (since there is a whole cover girl aquasmooth line) It really goes on nicely and isnt messy at all :D|`|Pg3voqXkaa	It really depends on the skin colour and whichever line tailors to it.      I recommend Maybelline Mousse.  It goes on very nicely and smoothly and doesn't have that 'caked' on type of feel.      I'd say just spend a day at the drug store and test different foundations on the inside of your arm and see which one matches your skin colour the best.  It'd probably take a long time, but it's worth it if you wear foundation everday.|`|8uUpAKPtaa	CoverGirl Aquasmooth is awesome!!

I'm super pale and the classic ivory almost looks weird because it's a lot more color to it then I have natural.) I use concealer first.|`|axE0qrJHaa	Try Bare Naturel Mineral Makeup.

lPCjNkEnaa	Give yourself a facial once every 1-2 weeks:  Cleanse  You should apply a gentle cleanser in a circular motion using the pads of your fingertips. Rinse and gently blot your face dry with a towel.  Steam  Fill a bowl with hot steaming water and cover your head with a towel while placing your face over the bowl for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes, dry your face gently with a clean towel.  Exfoliate  Apply the scrub in a circular motion using the pads of your fingertips. Rinse well and blot gently with a towel.  Baking Soda Scrub  You can use baking soda as an exfoliator: be careful when applying it to your face, since it is a very effective scrub. Massage the baking soda into your skin for ten to fifteen seconds and rinse.   Mask  Use a Mask.  Cucumber Mask   A small amount of mashed cucumber applied over the face will hydrate and refresh. Leave on face up to twenty minutes and rinse. Place a couple slices over the eyes for soothing eye treatment at the same time!  Toner  Use a Toner.  Moisturize  Spray water on skin then apply the moisturizer sparingly, using a gentle touch.      Neosporin  Use Neosporin on stubborn whiteheads, pimples, and/or scars overnight to help clear and heal skin.   NEOSPORIN: It kills bacteria, speeds the healing of wounds, and can minimize the appearance of small scars. Neosporins combination of Bacitracin, Neomycin, and Polymixin-B kills a broad range of bacteria beyond the typical acne treatments such as benzoyl peroxide. Also, unlike BP, Neosporin is unlikely to cause drying since it uses an oil base (something that acne sufferers typically try to avoid - however, its actually the oil underneath the surface that your glands produce which is more likely to become a barrier to clear skin). It also causes reduction of redness makes spots less obvious.

You'll just have to overcome your fears!|`|	Put it on really heavy the night before, then splash your face with water.  The next morning it will look like it's still there and it looks like a professional did it!    Or get it tattooed... :D just kidding! PLEASE DON'T!!!|`|	you could try very dark eyeshadow and only line the top eyelashes and bottom eyelashes with it. --x--|`|	Okay;;  Soo.  It depends on your skin color.  But like if you get a rich chocolate brown, or a black with a skinny applying brush and you apply it heavy on your lids or right on your eye lash line whatever thats called it could work, and if you put mascara starting at the root or very bottom of your eyelashes.    Andd if  you want to do the bottom use mascara but let it sorta touch on your eyes, it'll make it look like your wearing something,    But really once you get used to using eyeliner its not bad/  I get really nervous doing the top but i have this eyeliner that is in a container and you apply it with a brush.  it works great.    And it always takes practice.  Also if you use the regular one i'd use the crayon, and if you screw up on the top just rub it in.  It'll look fine.    Hope this helped!!  Ik its long. aha.(:|`|	Yes there is. When applying mascara blink on to the brush making sure the wand it close to your eyes. This will create a look that can be mistaken for wearing eyeliner.|`|	um no?|`|	Well eyeliner just makes your eyes look bolder. You can wear eye shadow and mascara, but I'm not so sure if it'll look like the same thing.|`|	How about Mascara? coat your bottom and top eyelashes with mascara... Or use dark eyeshadows instead.

PS: don't use a hair drier let it air dry or towel dry it.  blowdring makes ur hair frizzy.    hope that works 4   u it works great 4 me!

aBelaWLoaa	there are these strips you get at the drugstore that yanks them out. you put it on your nose, then rip, and they'll come out.     and try a face mask. I like the mint julep one from queen helene.|`|y05dLJfYaa	By "black points", I'm guessing you're talking about blackheads.  If you REALLY want to get them out, you'll have to push quite a bit. And considering its on your nose, it might hurt a little.  I've never really heard of any cream to get rid of blackheads, but you could try squeezing them out or washing your face.  Try looking into buying some ProActiv. :)|`|ZbqDLfFbaa	This always helps me!  Make sure its cools but is still slightly warm when you apply it.    Mexican Mole Sauce      * 2 teaspoons vegetable oil      * 1/4 cup finely chopped onion      * 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder      * 1 teaspoon ground cumin      * 1 teaspoon dried cilantro      * 1/8 tablespoon dried minced garlic      * 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup      * 1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers    Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and cook the onion until tender. Mix in cocoa powder, cumin, cilantro, and garlic. Stir in the tomato soup and green chile peppers. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl or pour directly over face.

aYICSwMpaa	Hi    The models on page 3 have to be under 5'3. This is to give them a more curvy look as the shorter you are the curvier it makes you appear.    They arent stick skinny either page 3 models. Someone I know modelled for page 3 of the sun and she was a 12. Although shes only 5'3.    X|`|0S7XXwhjaa	To be honest it all normally depends on breast shape; the erratic fat distrubution in the cells means that you can vary greatly from other women who are your breast size although the same bras fit.    I agree with the above :) they choose curvy women for the sun on which  they then pile on tons of facial and body makeup onto, they then airbrush and falsify these women further.  The vast majority of page 3 models have also had breast implants or cosmetic surgery of sorts, please try not to feel inadequate- it's all false :)   Kelly x|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	I am a 34C and I don't look like it.

The 2 best ways are 1st: Wash your hair really well and make sure to put a big dollop of conditioner in to make it nice and silky which will make it easier to iron. After it has completely dry turn on the iron( You shouldn't use a cheapo iron because it will make your hair dry and VERY frizzy!) Once the iron is hot enough straighten 1 small section at a time, about 2 inches at a time. Once you've straightened your hair put a little gel on starting at the roots that will keep the hair straight. However if you put to much it will take out the straightening only use a very little bit or use a little mouse.|`|GJEFaaTWaa	CHI, it has lifetime warranty, doesn't fry your hair, and leaves it smooth and silky.

sHUnctqIaa	If anything it will make them look darker and more sunken in. To brighten your eyes use an eye primer first, or brush a powder concealer all over your eyelid and under eye to even everything out. Before you put on your regular eyeshadow brush a bright white or bone colored shadow from the brow bone to the lash line to make your eyes look brighter and more open, then line them and you will be good to go.     Sounds like you could use a good eye cream too, or just stick a pair of spoons in the freezer and put them on the puffy part of your eye to reduce the puffiness. cold cucumber, rose petals and potato slices will work too.|`|taYFAwlzaa	Yeah(: Masacara and eyeliner. But mayve if its dark sometimes i would use a brighter eyeliner(:|`|gvtOLAPIaa	eyeliner makes your eyes look smaller.  if you want a wide-eyed look then just apply mascara|`|ezI5HwRWaa	Yes. It will help them look more awake. Just don't make it too thick and maybe put on mascara as well.    Try it and see how you like it. I usually put on a brown eyeliner instead of black. Black will make it stand out more I think.|`|vsUZ77AFaa	hiyah,    I really don't think so, mascara will make them more puffy, and eyeliner may smudge or just make them look darker. The best option (what I use) would be to just use concealer.     Hope that was helpful x|`|A7ovwP94aa	When you say puffy and dark do you mean eye bags and dark shadows under the eyes.    If so here are some concealers that have had good reviews for hiding eye bags and shadows. Buy a shade lighter than your skin tone.    Rimmel Recover Anti-Fatigue Concealer, (budget one for under eyes)  Bourjois Anticerne Pour Petits Matins  Anti Shadow Concealer (good budget concealer for eye bags)  Clinique Airbrush Concealer (good for under eyes, eyebags  Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage (good for under eyes, redness and other blemishes. In Style award 2006)  Dior Skinflash Radiance Booster Pen (described as a magic wand for dark circles, eye bags and shadows) seems to be popular.

sHUnctqIaa	Blend a light blue or silver shadow over your cheek bones, accentuate under eyes with a green or gray to make them look "baggy" use a foundation that is a shade or two too light, it will look a bit cakey and ghoulish. I also recommend blending some foundation accross your lips then cover with chap stick to make them look pale and faded. Use a bit of yellow based eyeshadow or foundation around your eyes to make them look sunken in.|`|Br3k7Hagaa	- use a really pale foundation.  - lightly sweep purple/blue eyeshadow over your cheeks and forehead.  - use a pale, yellow or gray eyeshadow lightly over your eyes.  - get some dark blue or gray/black foundation over natural eye-bags to make you look tired.    Hope this helps :)! x|`|gpeOH11Daa	whites and gray so you look pale on the face. grays blended in to look tired around the eyes.  something to take the red away from your lip color making more dull and blue, grayish, purple like you see someone outside who is cold.|`|MQ3EyxQYaa	Use baby powder on your face.. this will make you look really really pale and sick.

Bzu6mwNBaa	tongue piercings are my favorite piercings.<br>  its your body and its your choice. quite a few of my friends have tongue piercings. my brother got his tounge pierced the day before thanksgiving (not the best idea in the world) and i went with him. he said that the easiest part was the piercing itself. he had to stick to a bland/soft foods diet for about a week and the swelling went down within 10 days. dont mess with it or play with it because you could get and infection or damage your teeth. LET A PROFESSIONAL DO IT! if the place looks dirty LEAVE.<br>  <br>  but if this is really what you want go for it.<br>  <br>  im getting mine done this month for my birthday.<br>  <br>  good luck :]|`|8F3IHGADaa	Tongue piercings are really unattractive and trashy.

I never had this problem until the second piercing and I had the first one on its own for 2 years and it's not that bad a problem.<br>  <br>  Anyone who really wanted it I would say yeah sure go for it but I would say that to anyone who really wanted something. |`|YrfjXxlwaa	Why would you want to pierce your tongue?

I would buy either brown or beige. In addition, layering scarves (cashmere, wool, etc.) is really in. Try to buy mostly earth tones, that will match the outdoors around you. It will look really cute. Corduroy blazers and pants will also be very in, in addition to dark denim jeans (try juicy or true religion, they're really in right now). Lastly, try to buy mostly staples, then spice your outifit up with colorful layering and accessories. As far as hair, straight hair with side swept bangs will look cute for fall, because it will still look cute even underneath a hat and a million scarves. Once again, try to go with more earthy tones when it comes to makeup. TTYL!!! I hope this helped you look totally trendy for fall!!

cNzBfgFnaa	I am not sure where you live.  However, I always start at TJ MAX or Marshalls because they have name brand for less.  Because it is formal dress season, they should have a good selection.  If not, I would go to Macys.  They have beautifuls stuff, you will just pay more for it. If not there, then its Nordstroms and even more expensive.  I once found the most beautiful gown driving down the road in a window.  When I went in to see how much it was, not realizing the name of the store, just nervous I would not be able to afford it, they said it was on sale, making it $15.  No joke.  It was a dress that reminded me of the red dress in Pretty Woman and I bought it for $15 got long white gloves and an underskirt at the same store...all in all, it was $40 and the store....A SECOND HAND STORE.  Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|4f06382102ace92d536a786ce63c7a5caa	Nordstrom, Barneys, Saks, and Oscar De La Renta have super cute formal dresses. here are my top 5 favorites    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2998866/0~23...    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3005198?refs...    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2887749?refs...    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2962012?refs...    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2984554/0~23...    http://www.saksfifthavenue.com/main/Prod...|`|ZpEEwzZCaa	deb has some really cute long dresses!  http://www.debshops.com/Fashion/ViewInCa...  theres the link. hope i helped!

fTbYEKGuaa	I personally LOVEEEE dark brown eyes with any hair color/skin tone, but I love blue eyes with blonde hair, green eyes with red hair or black hair, and hazel eyes with anything. I think it is a combination of skin tone/hair color that makes your eye color so special. I don't think I could pick a favorite eye color, I think any color eye is cool :]    Hugs&kisses,  Adrian|`|BIU2OktKaa	hazels are def the nicest! i love my hazel eyes :D|`|rcV7Cmq8aa	pink eyes r gorgious|`|IytPJbv4aa	green eyes are definently the most beautiful eyes ever! their just cool looking and green in my favorite color.|`|YOKJP1evaa	Who give a damn?|`|kogfFMgmaa	wow ok u have pretty eyes good for u.  and a lot of people eyes change color.  mine change with watever colour shirt or makeup im wearing.  not a big deal.  um what is this question about?

e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	Its because there is still hair under your skin.    Try waxing, that will get the hairs underneeth your skin. Just go to any drugstore and buy those at home waxing kits|`|AA12249040	1. your razor probably is not very good. Try to buy one that has 3-4 blades.  2. Opt for waxing. Way better result|`|wGrRvFePaa	I have the same thing. Black hair and pale freaking legs though lol There's not too much you can do about it... I was told the only foolproof way to fix it is get them waxed instead. I'm considering doing that near the end of the winter. Not like I'm wearing shorts or skirts now, so I might as well let it grow a little around spring, then get them waxed.|`|Ye4qdX4Gaa	Get a sharper razor.|`|T2n1ufNTaa	The hair appears to grow in thicker and darker because it is shaved blunt. Normal hair growth causes hair to grow tapered and be thinner near the bottom of the hair and thicker near the top of it. When you shave it, you remove this tapered portion and it takes a long time to become tapered over time. It then looks darker and thicker.    Hair growth really isn't changed by shaving. It causes the hair to look different, but it doesn't change the hair or the growth patterns. Age and hormones do, however make more hair grow or can change the thickness of the hair shaft.     This can cause issues for some. If you think that you are experience an abnormal increase in the amount of hair you have, you can see a doctor to check for hormone issues, but you can't blame your razor.
fxRvGaILaa	I don't personally like people that do it in front of you and find it funny especially when your eating its puts me right off! lol<br>  <br>  =D|`|AA12203920	I dont personally<br>  but a lot of people do<br>  and i think that is SO stupid<br>  i dont understand why society has made farting like an embarassing kinda thing.<br>  it should get the same kind of reaction or thinking as a sneeze or a cough<br>  i mean, its only natural right? what you want us to hold it in or something?most of the time it doesnt even stink. its just expelling gas. |`|Po2UqfvWaa	doesn't matter who farts, it's gross. to me a guy would be more gross. hairy, smelly, sweaty, etc. to interfere with that stench. wow|`|4ark0TXqaa	farting is totally normal for boys AND girls! Tell them to get over it if they don't like it!!|`|koZLsY28aa	is gross if its done in public by anyone|`|lH6iMg5Jaa	umm it's gross for anyone. Not just for girls, anyone.. Thats sort of common sense..|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	My husband told me he knew I loved him when I farted in front of him. It was hilarious. Most guys would find it funny. |`|AA10179543	LOL, when you get older, guys wont think much of it at all.  Unless you go around trying to fart ON them.<br>  <br>  For me, if a girl farts around me, I know she feels comfortable with me and as silly as it sounds- its almost a compliment!<br>  <br>  I really think it depends on the guy- some will laugh and maybe tease you about it- others will think its a turn-off.<br>  <br>  Most guys dont fart intentionally in front of, or around a girl he is interested in either.  I remember plenty of dates going home with seriously painful cramps from holding it in for too long.  Maybe it is a natural way of setting a healthy time limit on a date?  When you cant bear the cramp anymore, its time to call it a night!?|`|AA12223259	yes it's gross for guys and girls.|`|56aupEoPaa	Anyone who farts around people is gross. I would never do that around anyone especially a guy. And I think it is a total turnoff for a guy to fart infront of me.|`|UUSI3Uy7aa	sometimes it is kinda gross, if they do it on purpose, but if they do it accidentally it is ok i guess|`|p2pqH3m3aa	U mean to tell me ... girls FART ??!??|`|dX35A23raa	haha same with me at sleepovers but i men if u dont kno the guy that well it might be weird but i am sure if ur friends that it would be as weird |`|nPETmctVaa	Its only  a body function, and totally normal for everyone to pass gas|`|NzrJeHTMaa	no way they should eat tons of beans and cabbage and garlic and sit around ripping a55 all the time!|`|RzkbwWYoaa	it's the most disgusting natural thing ever..... but everyone does it|`|f1rlc68qaa	its disgusting. I heard my girlfriend fart and now I'm not turned on as much by her. lol|`|TPUJVMeDaa	Oh yes its repulsive.  But you get used to it.  When you get married you will notice it happens by accident all the time.  Atleast once a month or so.  Maybe you will have almost an entire year without an accident and then you will hear 15 or 20 go off in the middle of the night and you just start laughing even though you are half asleep.  Its funny how when you are in a relationship and not married she will never fart or burp infront of you then she starts doing that when you are married to her and she says "I cant help it.  My tummy is upset!!"  |`|8rgMJugyaa	in public yes but in private with NOBODY there i think its perfectly fie|`|k3hY3FMjaa	i dont think its gross, but then again im a girl.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	no farting is disgusting for a girl that's why you never see a girl fart. ever see when a guy farts they have their shirt over their nose probably same thing with the girl except it's like unwomanlike. my friend farts in people faces. just putting it out there|`|732c93f221398a8118ade340f2e7c887aa	gross|`|3TV1u1AOaa	I think it's gross but I'm a girl and it happens. xP We can't control it...!<br>  <br>   Yeah, they would probably be turned off if they heard a girl do it. Guys are dumb. Why can they do it and not us? Lol.|`|TidS6E18aa	I dont think it is if they aren't in public|`|dQduI2a5aa	nope|`|2wsVYpPLaa	Passing gas is natural and any mature person will have the respect for a person and ignore it when someone has to fart.|`|cZbYtpT8aa	I geuss Un Lady like|`|b9HTkRDbaa	no i don't think so|`|Jt2piu7Gaa	anybody who farts is gross.<br>  <br>  so essentially everybodys gross.|`|ay8wAorwaa	farting is gross periodd.|`|2QJgiDLraa	Usually it's only gross to people you wouldn't normally feel comfortable farting around anyway.  I mean...usually you know right?<br>  but maybe when you've been together for three years and you've talked about the whole bodily functions situation...and he says he doesn't care.<br>  <br>  My husband says he wouldn't care if I did....but I could never do it in front of him. It's just gross.<br>  <br>  It could also be that a guy once told me that once a chick was comfortable to use the restroom with the door open...or fart in front of you the relationship was over. lol. Because you would have gotten to comfortable with each other.<br>  <br>  Although...farting generally is gross. And a gross fact is, the reason it smells is because there are tiny particles of poop floating around that go into your nose.<br>  <br>  Yummy. I shouldn't have answered this question. lol |`|6Sa4oyzoaa	If its by accident etc. i think its hilarious. A mate of mine Kayleigh belched really loudly in mid conversation with me the other day, an i was rolling on the floor laughing, it was so unexpected. An my sister is notorious for accidently farting when she doesn't know people are around, which is always funny.<br>  <br>  Overall: Yes, its hilarious, most guys will say its disgusting, but they secretly laugh about it.<br>  <br>  Ryan Stageman<br>  www.twilightgreen.com<br>  myspace.com/twilightgreen|`|CKadCmnZaa	I used to fart in front of my ex's but my current BF is repulsed by it, so i have to hold it in.<br>  He thinks its something ladies shouldnt do. <br>  But the truth is i fart all the time when im not around him, such apain that guys think girls shouldnt fart cos its one of lifes things. the Queen farts too!|`|CSziEKIOaa	A lot of guys want to think that their girl friends don't fart, burp, puke, or do any of the disgusting things that guys do.  But facts are it happens!<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion.... the best guys are the ones that understand and laugh cause you did it just the same as they would at themselves and their friends!!!|`|0GDGlHZ5aa	yeah! I do it all the time! |`|8Yif2doNaa	As the comedian big Jay Oakerson once said: Its always funny when a man farts, I can go strait into an air vent and its awesome. When a woman farts its almost tragic. "Oh my god why did you do that? Why don't you move out in the woods where nobody will ever have to be around someone who does that?"<br>  <br>  In truth, I guess it just comes off a little weird when a girl does something like that. |`|2exAj4UYaa	I asked my DH and he said it depends on how long you've known the girl.  He said he wouldn't want her to do it as much as him, but the occasional fart isn't a big deal.  He said it's kind of cute.  Of course we've been married for 8 yrs, and I fart all the time in front of him.  He just says PIG and we both laugh....|`|vCXpRgMyaa	just dont let anyone find out, and if is smells blame it on some one else :D lol|`|lgmIStBXaa	no but you shouldn't fart in public|`|n9kVA8xraa	of course its gross ..|`|21mpzKbsaa	Without a doubt, yes...|`|7d2d51608feb06e5d567ab2a7b42ad1caa	Just don't do it during a first intimate encounter. First few dates and what not. Beyond that we're all human, and most guys have a pretty good sense of humor about farts.|`|Yz33ZMWeaa	OHHHMYGOSHHHH NOOOOO!!!<br>  i give lectures about this all the time.<br>  it's a bodily function.<br>  think about it. is it repulsive to breathe??<br>  NO.|`|sWJwPcSkaa	farts are gross no matter who you are but girls tend to stink worst cause they're the most concentated but guys produce more volume so it evens out, but girls queef which isn't as bad as guy or girl farts|`|IA58U5Ngaa	No, it's normal.  Let it go, just don't be repulsive with it, and if it smells, apologize.  Go Cubs|`|DzxUVA2Iaa	I don't mind if she farts if she's in the next State, but if we're naked and exploring each other, I would rather she wouldn't!|`|8aa1b215c8d6eee277d8176d813caf1caa	We all have to let it out... |`|eFHP8LMsaa	its funny how guys can do it every where but when girls do it its gross so its better not to do it around boys.<br>  just dont do it |`|z8AlY7Vmaa	They would probably find it a little gross..<br>  & wouldnt have wanted to know in the first place.|`|qgEW5Koaaa	I don't fart around people if i can avoid it and i hope others would do the same for me.

T1wiQ2OCaa	- wear a scarf at night  - spray them with hairspray in the morning to keep them moist  - when you wash your hair, use a hair net (the kind designed for washing your hair with braids - you can probably find one at your local hair store)|`|tusCN8zpaa	You do need to wash and condition your hair. Then use some oil sheen on the braids. add a little gel on your edges and then tie your hair down with a scarf pretty tightly. it will lay the frizzies down. You could do that for a while, my hair is currently a little frizzy I might take my hair down in a week or two.|`|18afBRSXaa	Dont use conditioner when you take a shower, during the night, sleep normally but in the morning use hairspray to get rid of the wild hairs.

Otherwise, leave the mayo out.|`|AA10813849	im not a fan of putting food and beer in my hair..why wont you deep condition your hair with a deep conditioner...or a jojoba oil hair treatment...apply the product into your hair, keeping away from the roots, put on a shower cap and sit under a hooded dryer for 20 minutes...that's it!...there is soo many products out on the market to aide your hair....so please save the mayo for a sandwich okay?|`|AA10371567	yes. It is very important to make sure to moisturize ur hair especially since it is relaxed. Also pls make sure to get a good trim every so often to promote healthy hair and growth.

AA10991568	I'm not sure if you are referring to an actual iron that you iron clothes with, but your options are hot combs and flat irons, also known as Marcel Irons.  They are normally heated by electric stoves.  I'm sure you are already familiar with the type that you can plug in.  This is something that you need to get a professional to do because you could burn your hair right out of your head.  If you don't want to deal with irons period, then the only other thing is a chemical relaxer.|`|224f397ad57ab0c443a40bbcf4a224d4aa	Use cooking oil, leave it in your hair over night, **DO NOT WASH OUT**.

It makes my hair pretty straight and frizz free|`|79726ea30db1d52df21f7ffdda7fda21aa	when you get out of the shower immediatly blow-dry your hair with a brush pulling it to straighten it.
cNzBfgFnaa	First let me say that you are gorgeous!  When I opened the link, I was immediately drawn to a lot of silver.  My eyes moved up to see a radient face, slender, great curves, then back to the bottom half that really seems to make you look short and heavier that I believe you are.  Try the sweater with some skinny jeans and black boots.  I think it would work alot better.  You always want to draw attention away from possible problem areas, if you are short, you do not want to cut colors like that, if you are heavier lower body, no light colors on bottom with dark on top.  You would do the opposite, grey top, black on bottom.|`|igrdohopaa	Very cute (=|`|A6agxakwaa	no|`|DGGNXoXraa	its ok i guess.|`|vxEWguqqaa	it's okay but i wouldn't wear it.|`|JjRii7Kaaa	I don't really like it because it makes you look like a midget.    But if you are midget, than thats cool.    With your pose, bodays type, and factors of each article of clothing made you seem very short.|`|vGHExDOzaa	Nope if you had white leggings and brown shoes then it would be okay but the shirt looks like it is way to big for you|`|A9EydXySaa	I LOVE IT! :D|`|13LqodO7aa	i did not like it  the leggings blend wit the boots  and the shirt does not go good wit your skin    thats just me though|`|W0b2oqZvaa	cut3 shirt mah-mah|`|zpovg4U7aa	it's not bad but the similar colors of your tights and your shoes don't go very well. i think it would look better with black tights, so that you are not just two colors (since it doesn't look like you were really going for a colorblock or duotone look). and maybe add some long silver necklace. it's not a bad outfit, & this is just my opinion so you should go with your instinct. if you like my idea, certainly go ahead and use it.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Cute!!!      Looks awsome against your amazing skin tone.|`|BC9nPXG7aa	not really|`|vvj7IY9Gaa	its not something i would wear but you look great in it|`|eD9frdYmaa	sorta. it makes you look really short|`|aFJQje7kaa	ehh, its not that great.    for me the leggings totally ruin it  they're like so shiny ! D:    and they're the same colour as the boots    so its like BROWN on top and GRAY/SILVER on bottom    it looks kinda weird.|`|pQi3xtZgaa	I dont really like it, I guess because its too much the same color. If the tights were a different color and the dress wasnt long sleeves It'd be cuter. ^_^|`|BkucBPwjaa	its not that bad but u should hav worn it with out the jeans and boots maybe some cute heals|`|AA11125205	well it does need some help. you cant really tell where nyour shoes start. and that shirt is kinda wierd shaped and its all to tight|`|yuDnMYkjaa	I like the style just on the colours , gray tights look bad and the gray boots dont look nice.

It's ok its and its not like OMG WTF lol.|`|FbuXn5AZaa	umm its ok! prob go for darker boots with that outfit though x|`|7mrtqwJwaa	love the shirt|`|1jfdJJrOaa	you shouldnt wear the pants.. they dont flatter your body and they make you look fatter and shorter than you are..|`|0NjU7Ps0aa	Its not that bad lol though I think you should either wear different shoes (likes black pumps) or a shorter turtle neck top because i feel like its an awkward length you know?     http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    and these shoes     http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|snOPKSecaa	wear black leggings instead with a long black necklace. the silver leggings clash with the silver boots..|`|3Nr9o9UDaa	different color boots would have been better, maybe brown?  the first time i looked at it i didnt even know you were wearing boots  so that part, not so good  everything else was pretty cute|`|vkVbkz5Taa	I never liked these type of boots, so sorry!

IE4E0I4Laa	I know it sounds weird but I put lip gloss where I put my eye shadow is and it seems to work well.|`|PumYhJSvaa	Buy an eyeshadow primer. You can get fairly cheap ones that work well at a drugstore/department store. However the best you can get is by Urban Decay. It's called Primer Potion.|`|LNOsY8Jiaa	After you put it on give it this command: Sit, stay!    :-) Sorry, I'm just having a little fun.|`|OsT64mqMaa	Get a makeup concealer. Or touch up in bathrooms.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	Concealer, Chap Stick, Lotion    it works :D|`|ORupWJg3aa	start with a good eye shadow base! u put it on before your eyeshadow it makes the shadow go on better and stay on longer, some good brands are urban decay primer potion and two-face shadow insurance! but the more mainstream companys also make them too|`|GkisYUVDaa	get a primer for your eyes. the one that i would recommend is urban decay potion which is $16.  but if you have drier eyelids you should check out too faced shadow insurance which is $17|`|AA12206467	do you have oily skin???  always start with a clean face and make sure your moisturizer has set in....before applying eyeshadow try a bit of cornstarch on your eyelids to absorb any excess oil...with a big brush...and after you apply ...but at the same time when you do apply your eyeshadow apply it a bit heavier than usual because the cornstarch will lighten it up but practice...and if that does not seem to work you can try rice powder ( the packaging  has a china doll on it) and it works great...use it instead of the cornstarch...i dont suggest powder only because it does not absorb for a long period of time...|`|EQv5CBSeaa	The best way to get your eyeshadow to stay put all day is to use a shadow primer. I recommend Urban Decay Primer Potion as it is the best I have used so far. I personally like to use MAC Cream Color Bases and MAC Paint/Paint Pots. These really adhere the color all day without smudging or creasing and they make colors show up their true color, especially when using pigments. They also make shadows and pigments incredibly blend-able, so if you find that you have trouble with this then you might want to check out the paint pots.    If you are on a real budget and need to do something on the cheap then try a concealer. Apply a concealer (creams are best) to your eye with a brush, set lightly with translucent powder and then apply shadows as usual.     When applying creams and liquids to the face and eye make sure and use an artificial fiber brush like a concealer brush or any other nylon brush.     Hope this might have helped!

LNcbSWfPaa	Obviously celebrities have got money to spend on their body, and they also use body makeup to cover their imperfections, not to mention if they are taking photos, pictures have to be touched-up on the computer before they go public! <br>  <br>  Why don't you try covering the stretch marks with some make-up if you feel conscious about them?|`|msIfItMPaa	There is nothing that can get rid of stretch marks - even laser treatment don't work. Waste of money. |`|092bea1320ac52f2f7cd0e47cb63f9e5aa	Rubbish.. stretch marks are permanent however,you can reduce the size of them by massaging the toxins out of the damaged tissue.... you do that by placing some oil over the top of them, and pressing the palm of your hand into you tummy,and rubbing up toward the heart..... as this encourages the lymph system to move the toxins out of the tissue and into the lymph system toward a respective node for processesing|`|eZJ90NB4aa	Just put vitamin e oil on your belly and the stretch marks will go away. also apply lotion regularly.

48GfaHIXaa	Hi there, <br>  well it is illegal to get pierced with a gun on any part of the body except the lobes.<br>  <br>  The needle is much finer, as it does not shatter the cartilage, you will feel a little sting, but then it's done.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and if you do get it done only with luke warm salt water is best to clean with, it is natural, and heals very fast.<br>  <br>  Minny :-)|`|z5EDtgtyaa	I think the only person who can answer that is the person who is doing the piercing I say this because you don't want to go with one thing and find out that they are going to do the other you know what I mean. call a local place and see what they use and ask them if the gun is damaging to the cartilage if that's what they use. most places use guns when doing piercings|`|DsQwrkYYaa	i got my ear pierced with a needle and it was so sharp and fast that it didnt hurt at all. but that wasnt the cartilage part|`|2lalquYuaa	I've gotten my ear pierced by both a gun and a needle, and I have two cartiledge piercings. Both of my cartiledges were done with a gun. It's quick and mostly painless - it just feels like you're getting pinched, and before you know it, it's over. As far as infections go, as long as you clean it daily , you should be fine. The gun didn't do any damage to my ear.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped you out.|`|I6dQK9BBaa	Needle.. guns are unsanitary, they use the same one for everyone...Go to a tattoo shop and get it pierced. I did and it barely hurt.|`|HdtLTILxaa	gun. its way less painful. i couldn't even feel it.|`|e5744c3f3f189b7ade0d15b16cfb0746aa	I got my cartilage done with the gun the first time and it got infected so I had to go to the tattoo parlor to find out what I could do to help it. Finds out the back of the earring was pinching it so they pierced it again with a needle and put a hoop in and it healed with in like 3 weeks. I would def go with the needle. It didn't hurt either!|`|VbGw5QP0aa	get it done by a gun because it is much quicker and you dont have to deal with the pain as much and alot of people i seen have done it and there was no damage at all.|`|DL2LldZ7aa	I like the guns

It looks nice straightened, but it will have bad effects on your hair. If you do it too often, it starts to smell funny, you get split ends, and it gets really, really frizzy. So maybe just do it every Friday or something.|`|TQ7mBjvkaa	Straight. take it fromm me... myy hairr iss exactlyy likee yours. andd i hatee it.!!! everytimee i straighten it everyonee tellss meee how nicee i look alsoo. butt yeahh i wouldd def. go withh thee straight hair. :)|`|J48VE1Q5aa	i think you are lucky to have the opportunity to wear your hair in a couple of really great, distinct styles.  not everyone gets that chance... i wish i had cool curly hair like you!    i like your hair in both fashions.  they are both flattering looks, and maybe you can wear them different ways depending on your mood.  i bet you if your co-worker was constantly seeing you with straight hair, and then one day saw you with curly hair, he would have been impressed with it!  it's weird, sometimes people are just impressed with a change.      my hair is naturally wavy.  to be honest with you, i'm usually too lazy to do anything to it in the morning, so i just put it up or spray some hairspray on it and go to work.  occasionally, i will straighten it, and when i do, people usually say something about my hair.  i've always attributed the remarks to the change of my style, and not necessarily that is looks better.  but who knows?  beauty is in the eye of the beholder afterall!    i guess there will always be people who will prefer your hair one way or another... as long as you are confident and comfortable with your look, that's all that counts.  just keep switching it up and keep surprising people!  it's fun that way.|`|bsaAI0HFaa	STRAIGHT

I like a guy to be hairy.  I do not like a lot of back hair.  I don't mind butt hair.  But I am having nightmares of this stark LINE just below your waistline (like the edge of a putting green and the rough or something).  I think it is 'normal' for a guy to have hair on his butt, but it is usually the same amount of hair he has on his legs.  So maybe the back hair is unrelated. :)  Good luck!|`|AA11029103	I don't think that it matters it is all in the eye of the beholder. If you don't like it continue with the laser hair removal. You have to be comfortable with yourself before you can decide to make anyone else happy. You are not the first man I know that has alot of hair everywhere and you certainly wont be the last I am sure.
qM1qoDhCaa	I like the first one. I love the big puffy modern day Gone with the Wind look. You have to be careful with yellow, it can make you looked washed-out if you even a little bit pale.

FbuXn5AZaa	Pick up a couple of shopping tours from TailoredTours.com. They come with store maps and also point out interesting sights and authentic restaurants in the shopping areas.    Madison Ave. and Fifth Ave. have the same stores (although Madison Ave. has 4 times the number of stores). The difference is that Madison is for locals while Fifth is for tourists.    There's a lot of shopping on 34th St. around Macy's.    If you're going to do an outlet mall, Woodbury's great but Jersey Gardens is much closer (right near Newark Airport) and has about the same number of stores. You can catch a bus direct to Jersey Gardens from the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 8th Ave. and 42nd St. It costs maybe a couple of bucks.    As far as places to avoid, stay below 96th St. on the Upper East Side and below 125th St. on the Upper West Side. The Lower East Side can be a little sketchy, as can the area along the Hudson River west of Times Square. That said, just about anyplace in Manhattan is safe during the day.

ed9cb59e2768138ee4099f60b199cfcfaa	Paraffin is a luxurious wax treatment for your hands.  It can be done by itself or its a wonderful treatment during a manicure.  Your hands are massaged with hand lotion and then dipped several times into the wax.  A plastic bag and heated mitts are applied for several minutes until the wax has cooled and hardened. It is beneficial for people who suffer from arthritis or chapped hands. It is usually kept in a warmer. If you like it you can also purchase one for your home.  They are inexpensive and the refill wax can be purchased at Sally's Beauty Supply.|`|RrmkaKJlaa	1) Paraffin in its solid state. <br>  <br>  2) A waxy white or colorless solid hydrocarbon mixture used to make candles, wax paper, lubricants, and sealing materials. Also called paraffin wax. <br>  <br>  3) From crude petroleum; used for candles and for preservative or waterproof coatings <br>  <br>  Paraffin wax is mostly found as a white, odorless, tasteless, waxy solid, with a typical melting point between about 47 °C to 64 °C ( 116.6°F to 147.2°F), and having a density of around 0.9 g/cm3.[2] It is insoluble in water, but soluble in ether, benzene, and certain esters. Paraffin is unaffected by most common chemical reagents, but burns readily.<br>  <br>  |`|KSsQKBkLaa	parrafin is a thing that makes your hands soft<br>  <br>  my mom got that once she dipped her hands in warm wax and they were sooo smooth!

My hair grows pretty quickly. And inorder to also help your hair to grow find a good shampoo and conditioner that works for your hair, like I found Mane N Tail deep moisterizer shampoo and conditioner which kelp keeps my dry hair moisterized. Get your ends trimed every 4-6 monthes, and use leave in conditioner. |`|UM6rA1Whaa	Vitamins B for sure<br>  also eating lots of protein is good for you hair by making it longer and stronger<br>  :)|`|aiJ4rL9vaa	Prenatal Vitamins are really good for your hair and nails, regardless of if your preggo or not. |`|NpVWY00Aaa	Omega-3 |`|jTkX9HJyaa	Yeah I agree<br>  Omega-3 is really good for hair<br>  <br>  so are flaxseed oil gel caps|`|2FLym8UFaa	e and b are good for your skin<br>  c is good for healthy nails and teeth<br>  and so i guess we're stuck with vitamin a

It's something that comes from you. No one can do it for you, they can support but the final commitment must come from you........if you want to........do it. Do it for you.|`|356wlmrGaa	what i do is put nail polish on them so i won't bite them but since you don't like doing manicures probably there are pharmacies where you could buy nail polish that will stop you from biting your nails|`|xZr6GylBaa	wear gloves/mittens and use that stuff that makes you nails taste nasty<br>  |`|eDP8IEH6aa	keep them short by cutting them once a week; at least until you get used to not biting. paint them with clear strengthening polish so they are harder to bite (try sally hansen diamond strength, you can get it at any drugstore). it's easier than a manicure because it dries fast and it's clear so you don't have to worry about messing up! tell your friends that you are trying not to bite your nails so if they ever catch you, they can make you stop. good luck!!|`|quLtMbYwaa	You could just stop biting your nails a couple of ways.<br>  You can buy stuff to put on them- kinda like nail polish. It taste horribl and keeps you from doing it. Eventually you will be out of the habit!<br>  You can also just pop in some gum or a mint when you feel the urge to bite them coming on.<br>  Hope this works!|`|xR5HuUGHaa	I have the same problem I have bit my nails since i was little, and sometimes I can go a month with out doing it but they get really soft from biting them so much. If you do find a away to stop you got to let me know. And I have tried to get the stuff hat taste bad but I can never find it
t0MiDBMEaa	My husband has 5 white dress shirts and 2 black, blue, grey, beige and green shirts. Any fall colors he has only 1 of.  Now his pants he has about 20 pairs of slacks in every color and then many with stripes.  He has 10 suits and has 1 of every color.  I never wash his dress clothes they all go to the dry cleaners because his clothes are very expensive and washing in your home washer will ruin them.  He wears his slacks and shirts once and his suits are dry cleaned after 3 wears.  I try not to separate the suits because if the pants get dry cleaned more than the jacket it will show. He has about 75 ties but he wears one everyday.  He has 3 pairs of black dress shoes and 2 pairs of dark brown and 2 pairs of lt. brown shoes.  I hope this helped and keep in mind that we did not buy all this at one time.|`|boqwvEvUaa	i looove guys in business attire ;)   i think four suits are a good number, especially if you're on a budget and nice suits are pricey. one in black, one with pinstripes, one in a nice gray or more casual but still classic color, and one of your choice (um, don't go crazy and get like a polka dot suit or anything 8D). you really don't need one of every color--where and when would you wear a red or purple suit?   i'm not sure about when you would wash a suit, but i don't think you need to wash it every time after you wear it, as long as you take good care of it. over-cleaning would ruin it.

7b6426093c3b397cabd69df3410a8406aa	You should get your pores cleaned out at least once a week. You get a big bowl in your house and boil some water. Pour the water in the bowl, and get a towel. Sit down and put your face over the bowl, then place the towel over your head. Stay under for as long as you can take the heat. The heat will release the dirt and oils from under your skin. You should use soap, get one without oils. Dove soap is great and wash your face with cold water. Pat dry. Then Throw out the water and clean the bowl and repeat the process. Don't touch your face or allow anyone to touch it. When You dry your face from sweating don't use your hand, always use a towel and pat dry. This will help with the pimples. Soap usually dry out your face and skin. Most skin cream have a lot of oil so they don't work as well as soap. Good luck. A tip with pimples, Wash your hands then get some toothpaste and put it on the pimple only, pimple creams is useful this way as well. Leave it on your face overnight, and do this consistently every time you get a pimple and you will get rid of them. Also try proactive it works great as well.|`|c8c089a122bbf8d578e9958ac142d8cfaa	Wash it a lot and don't eat too much candy or greasy foods.|`|c08a28dc1d37800307c1140e3ad32488aa	Oily skin:  http://www.askaquery.com/Answers/qn1676....|`|b26b70b9605f236d370a0b4043e090baaa	if u completely dry out your skin from oils it will only encourage your pores to produce more oil therefore aggravating the area. clean your face with a mixture of lemon juice and cooled boiled water and Wash with only natural no soap no perfumes added.    if you are looking for products to help you i also sell these at my eBay shop at http://stores.ebay.co.uk/Pips-Products  try them they might help. good luck.|`|0e8725f307a9f9055987c055482df4d8aa	wash your face every 2-3 hours with soap or with face wash. or you can try this out  i also had oily skin so i started using pears soap for my face and guess what  now i don't have oily skin nor pimples.|`|03fc0728bc0b3b3f13505721f07948f3aa	you need proper skin care for that|`|AA11507672	you can get lemon and squueze the juice out...mixe it with yogurt and put it on your face...the lemon will take the oil away and the yogurt will moisturize it...but the lemon juice needs to be a little bit ok? take care|`|72b94f1257c38cd860d46a18dff865cdaa	even i have z same prob. i reed zat vit a can dry it. try it me also doing z same.|`|AA11197955	use oil blotter paper.

As for TJ Maxx I've never been there.
MjKOBQQqaa	Dryness doesn't only occur at the surface of the skin. The deep layers of living skin cells (the dermis) also dries out.    So a moisturizer alone will not work.    A moisturizer will only treat the surface layer. But your face can still feel tight and dry after.    Instead look for a deep moisturizing serum. This will be more appropriate.    A Serum is designed to penetrate deeply into the skin. Therefore it can supply moisture to both the surface and the dermis.    So instead of only using a moisturizer also consider a serum|`|dxWf70Khaa	Stop using soap!    Follow this advice instead. Your skin will be perfect.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOxuazaa6...|`|6xfp3bAVaa	Clinique Moisture Surge! I use it and it doesn't make my face feel oily or anything. I'm sure it's oil free. My face gets oily if I don't wear that through out the day. Try going to a Clinique counter to get a sample for free or just get the smaller jar. It lasts for a long time and a little goes a verrrry long way!      http://www.clinique.com/templates/produc...|`|P9Ke9HQFaa	I love Mary Kay Velocity facial moisturizer and lotion. It makes my face feel great and the moisturizer is really light. The best way to buy it is on eBay.

qrio1FrGaa	I do mine like this:  1.Concealer  2.Foundation  3. light bronzer    Eyes:  1.Take black eyeliner and make a thick line that goes off your top eyelid a little.  2. Line your waterline with 2 coats of eyeliner  3. use a soft or natural color for you eyeshadow  4. Smudge your EYESHADOW  5. Use black-blue or brown mascara, one coat does the trick    Cheeks:  1. use a champange, light shimmery pink, or peach powder blush on the apples of your cheeks    Lips:  1. Use a lip liner that matches you lipgloss (or lipstick) nd line your lips  2. Put on chapstick  3. Put on your liptick  4.

taYFAwlzaa	The orange one. Its called the Lashblast. Just a natural look get dark mascara. And to make it look darker with the lashblast brush it on the top and then on the bottom of your lashes keep on doing that just a tip(:  and i think black mascara will look good on you especially when you have green eyes(:  p.s. im arounnd you age(:  middle school[;|`|AA12249040	L'Oreal Mascaras are good.

ChK2Au6Oaa	Your probably going to want to wait until your at least 16. They are very cute and I pierced someones snakebites for them and they said just the first one hurt. I'd say go for it.    BTW. All piercings do hurt people in some way or another.. either the healing process or the actual piercing itself. All it takes is time for it to heal and you should be fine. Just make sure you get it professionally done. Hope this helps!|`|fRWWUgMoaa	i dont know if they hurt but when your 60years old your going to feel like a retard with those 'snakebites'.  wait a bit. your views on things like this will change.|`|6YDmNdasaa	All piercings hurt a little,  I find lip piecrings to hurt A LOT less then other ones  Ive had angel bites (A monroe on each side)  http://a345.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/ima...

They do take a VERY long time.     Just wondering, how did the fire happen?|`|uUvV7eadaa	yeah, they grow back. I have really long eyelashes too, and if one is growing like the wrong direction or if its not curly enough, I pluck it out. mine grow back really quickly though, I guess it just depends on genes how fast.

They went over to this ladies house and  there in her china cabinet was her dead  husbands stuffed head. I know this sounds really weird, but there is no way my grandma and great grandma were lying about. Anyways, I really would not stuff the leg. Good luck though!|`|AA11491574	yeah... I guess it would be sorta weird.  But then again, it is your leg.  Do what you want to do with it.|`|AA11400994	I think it's kind of weird but we're not talking about me or anyone else. This is for YOU. I say go and do it. But I think you should keep it in your room because it might freak out company if it were in the common areas of your house. I hope it works out for you!!|`|AA11287779	Well, for one, that's disgusting, and two, you do not need your leg around constantly reminding you of things you can't do anymore, it would actually traumatize you in the long run, and three thats just plain creepy.

And his prosthetic leg freaked me out, I could imagine what your girlfriend or wife would think later on.  Don't do it, please, I am getting chills just thinking about it...lol EWWWWW!!!!!!

Go see a shrink, you sicko!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11684165	I'd have to agree with the parents here..........Just let it go.  If you really don't want to let it go,  consider taking a picture of your leg before the surgery and framing that.  And no I don't know of anyone whos ever done that.|`|0aa9a0552b032ede2aa1f884ecad6383aa	Ya it would kinda be weird but it is your leg i just dont understand why yo would want to keep it wouldnt that depress you knowing that it's never going to be on you and you wont be the same without it. I dont know if anyone else has done it tell your parents that it is your decision because its your leg.|`|AA11618585	LMAO, no, that's really gross.  I've always thought that if I lost a body part, I would put it in a big Ziploc storage bag and keep it in the freezer.  This is a much better idea.  That way, medical science might advance one day to where they can graft the leg back on, and you also get to look at it whenever you go to get a popsicle.

But there are alternatives you can use that will make the marks less noticeable. Try Body Shape by avon. I love this stuff and its good for not only stretch marks but cellulite as well. It takes about a week before you see major results but if u continue to use it daily then you will be happy with the results that it gives you. If you have any questions about it please don't hesitate to email me.

If you don't want to do this, wash your hair at night, comb through it a mixture of styling cream and hair gel and then braid it while it is still wet. In the morning, you can take the braid out and blow dry any wet sections.

They also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your cosmetic surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.If you still havent got your surgery done,you are better off getting it done in India.      my cousin got a couple of plastic surgery including breast enhancement and implant procedures through the forerunners healthcare in India and is all praise for this company.She is more than very happy with the results.she just paid 30% of the amount she was quoted in USA.hope this helps.       http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com|`|AA11608353	Mabey not, and u won't know 4 sure until you try to breast feed.

AA10571948	I didn't use any kind of wax or anything to make my locks stay. I just kept on twisting my hair every day with regular hairgrease. It's cleaner to do it the natural way because bee's wax attracts dust and dirt and it sticks in your hair. It took my hair about 8 or 9 months to lock completely. I don't know if you're white or black, but if you're black, twisting without any wax would probably be better because your hair probably naturally kinky of fluffy anyway. If you're white you probably would have to use some kind of wax to get your hair to stay together.|`|3bfbe33a0aec9d05b4be5723ab745f6baa	It says on Wikipedia that "Dreadlocks, sometimes called simply dreads or locks, are matted ropes of hair which will form by themselves if the hair is allowed to grow naturally without the use of brushes, combs, razors or scissors for a long period of time."

Think about that first|`|AA10530337	If you are Black American and have a relaxer you would have to let the relaxed hair grow out to the new growth and cut the relaxed hair off. Then you can get twist to start off but you are not to wash them or get them wet because that will stop the locking procedure. I would strongly suggest that you find some one to teach you how to lock your hair and to teach you how to care for them as well. People fail to understand that you have to take care of them just as you would anything else. Locking hair is a very commented thing so if your in hair styles and color day in and out then maybe this not for you not saying that you can't change your locks cause you can but unlocking to locking that's a no unless you twist your hair which is different all together.

I am Indian (as in India) and have a brown skin tone. It's generally been the same mindset about fair/white skin being more attractive and caucasian features etc. in India and among Indians from my observation. I think mass media and culture have pervaded this viewpoint globally and it affects alot of people subconsciously. So, it's a difficult issue to just snap out of. Personally, i've decided to do some counselling about this and get to the root of my thought patterns. I think if you help your girlfriend through counseling to think through this issue and in particular her thoughts that would help her more profoundly with her self image and esteem concepts.  As far as the aesthetic part, i am afraid i cannot help you there.

You can try a leather cream called ResQ.     You can purchase it online at http://mensfolio.com/product_info.php?pr...    All you need to do is dab a small quantity of the cream on a cloth and wipe your bag with the cloth. It removes dirt, mold and conceals fine scratches. If your bag has a deep scratch, try kiwi (neutral or tan color).

Just make sure that you buy enough color to cover your whole head really well. and check the box, make sure it shows your natural color on the box and it should show you what it will look like if you apply the color. the results.  Make sure you buy a good conditioner, and use it, because your hair is already damaged, and coloring it again will do more damage. unless your hair is in really awfull shape, you will be fine, people color and re-color all the time, just pamper your hair for a while after, and avoid doing anymore colors and that for a while. any more ??? feel free to ask =)|`|AA12284110	You can get either get another kit and try to do them more evenly, so you'll cover up the highlights you have now or...your second choice would be to just dye your hair back a shade or two darker than your natural color.

This way, even if you dye it darker, your hair is going to fade out to pretty much your natural color in a few weeks time.|`|06a8038be5888cd7337918d490f52ff3aa	I am a hairdresser and my suggestion would be to either cut it short or go to a professional and have them bring it back to your natural coloe.

Pick a hair dye color that's close to what your natural hair color is. Use the permanent one since that comes out in about 3 months. Since you used loreal highlights you must get the same brand of hair dye. My aunt is a hairdresser and she told me this. After you dye your hair wait at least 24 hrs before highlighting it again. If you decide not to take chances in re-highlighting it, you can just leave it the way it is. By the time the dye fades out, the highlights will be gone. The highlights should dissapear in a month anyway. You won't be able to tell it was dyed if you pick a dye close to your natural hair color.

e847661ff7644f5a49877dac444612bcaa	Honey, i know what you mean i was overweight when i was about 9 years old was actually 159 pounds i weighed more than my 17 year old sister.  I was constantly teased which made me feel very bad about myself.  So i decided to make a change  I started exercising 5 times a week for about 45 minutes a day and eating smaller proportions of food but ate at 3 every 3 hours.s that are good to do is WALK, Jassercise, Go Biking, and Kick Boxing.  Losing weight is not an easy thing but it is not what you should be afraid of it's just you taking charge of your body. Now i'm in a size 4 and is actually more fit than my sister.  But take charge of your life and be healthy|`|AA12203920	Hey, i'm 77 pounds and 12 its ok. You still have friends right???sometimes you cant help it, even if you diet and exercise and everything. Sometimes its just genes or slow metabolism. Plus, muscle weighs more than fat!|`|2d95cbb4196c4df3251023bc03264b6aaa	How tall are you? If you're taller than most people your age, it's ok to weigh more. Otherwise, if you're around the same height, talk to your mom and ask her if you can see a nutritionist to help you figure out if you're the right weight. Remember, you may be growing faster than the other girls in your grade so it might be perfectly fine for you to weigh more. They'll all catch up.|`|2c11d1bcae397ac6befbbf78cde5b96daa	ur too young to be worried about weight but hers advice.. join a soccer team! trust me it whips you into shape like *snap* that and ur not overweight it depends on how tall u r .. if ur tall like me then u prooly arent fat|`|f99d601f4753a773e745285be5c1076daa	Are you tall? If you're like 5'4 then you're cool. But don't worry about what others think. Love yourself for who you are and not what you look like or what others say. God bless!|`|c819982a51a496fe7d0c6510ab3d31e3aa	Have you discussed this with your parents?  You set up a strict diet and exercise plan with them and it's up to YOU to stick with it. Don't eat junk at school either.  There should be salad or fruit offered.  You can lose an average of 2 pounds a week if you follow the agreed plan.  AVOID bread, pasta, sweets, and have diet drinks like crystal light.  It is very important that you get at least 30 minutes of exercise EVERYDAY.  I wish you well.|`|db7bba9e5c68e03f56ef1d44993d0c94aa	Actually, that's probably a much healthier weight, depending on your height. Really skinny people look disgusting to me, especially when they're just skin and bones...|`|e26ff1944e30ae8cab1b0a356fae2bcbaa	There is nothing wrong with being who you are. This country is so fixated on being thin.....too thin.  You are young and being overweight is something you shouldn't be worrying over.  Have you spoken with your mom to get her opinion?  You are unique and special no matter what everyone else looks like.  What matters most is what is on the inside and the type of person you are.  Don't let people at school or anyone else tell you who to be.  Just be you!!!|`|AA12213644	Sweetheart if you are eating healthy and exercising, then you are HEALTHY!  Don't worry abut what the scales says. Ask your doctor next time you go.  State your concerns and your doctor will either say "Yes, let's work on that" or "You are fine and are doing all the right things".  Whatever the outcome, just remember  you are young, and weight does NOT need to be a worry of young kids these days.  You are fantastic just the way you are! :)    My daughter just turned 10.  She weighs 88 lbs.  She is just perfect.  Not over weight and not skinny either.  She walks on the treadmill 15 minutes a day and is very active. I feed very healthy foods and she just weighs what she weighs.  I am sure you are the same way.  Take care!|`|AA10794679	Okay- I freaked out when I hit my over 100  I cried...a lot.  Your not fat...and TRUST me they aren't all 70.   If theyre 70 at 11, then theyre underweight, lol  Some people, such as myself, have a thicker bone structure than others...so your body shall develop the way it wants too. I wish we all actually had a say in it though.  How long do you exercise? Try about 30 mins - and hour of cardio a day, and usually, when you gain weight while doing that...its good. Muscle is denser than fat, therefore it weighs more.  Eat smaller portions, and leaner meats, more vegtables.  Okie dokie?  |`|efde11042eedb38b1b1d59570c0859a5aa	wait a couple of years. if it keeps up then go to the doctor. do not do anything without his/her agreement for you
PrQqIhcSaa	it doesn't work well but it makes your hair smell very nice  i wouldn't recommend it|`|QRn984YPaa	Hmm.. Try different ones and see which are best for you and ur hair and body :D              Mariinaaa |`|rryyG04iaa	I tried it, and it was horrible..

I like the lighter shade, the tan one.    But anyway, just wear dress pants.|`|kogfFMgmaa	um. ud be cold.|`|BQY6itt6aa	cute . totally appropriate , can you wear khakis?     i think it would be cute with  a denim skirt though , but i understand you cant wear jeans|`|xY65R25kaa	Yeppp.  Cute, but still dressy.    I would go with a white lace tank underneath and navy pants,  or tan pants.|`|soncFl6Daa	no, you will be hot. i did that trip a long time ago it was a ton of walking you will be so hot.  unless you will be going very soon.  if so i would go with cordouroy sorry cant spell pants in navy|`|kngVZGNeaa	for sure with a navy t under or a navy tank|`|nd6r6nOvaa	Yes its cuute!!!

oEM2YL6Laa	The ultimate hair straightener for all kinds of hair is GHDs- it achieves perfect results both on my (Caucasian) hair and my friend who has an out of control afro on a good day when she doesn't straighten it.|`|ZPzZq8Fcaa	any shampoo or conditioners will work.  but try and use ones from the brands, pink, dark and lovely or beautiful beginnings.    most straighnteners should work but i use wahl equipment ( from the powerpik to the straighteners )    wahl is especially made for afro-caribbean hair.  try and use the wide plated ceramic coated straighteners.|`|YFiBGarkaa	hiya i am studying hair at college and we do condition treatments the best shampoo and conditioner weve come across is from sally services you should have one maybe around you there are lots of them around but sometimes quite hard to find see where there is one round you or order online http://www.sallybeauty.com/ the shampoo and condition is in a yellow tub with a purple lid and is called Motion CPR they do deep conditioners as well which are brillant i really recommended it if you cant find a sallys try a market place where they have a hair stool and im sure theyl sell it!|`|45f50f01a43af0d0207afc5896c6b22caa	Don't know much about this subject but I gather from talking to others that GHD Mk 4's are the best straighteners on the market! Hope this helps!|`|rNSGZBB2aa	I am not sure with the straightener-part but there is a shampoo and conditioner called sunsilk they have shampoo's and conditioners for all kind's of hair problems they even have leave in conditoner and mousse they have all kind's of products so yes I hope this helps !!!! bye
TKHHRUB4aa	The making of Egyptian perfume has been buried in the sands of times.
j5tHwFjJaa	Never understood why men or women would go so far out of their way to make themselves look unappealing looking, but to each his own.  Personally, i think it looks silly, stupid and very immature, not to mention unattractive.  I would imagine, though, that other women will like it because it makes less competition for them.|`|WO68RZdIaa	I won't dock any points if she was attractive with or without the Mohawk.    But- a Mohawk on a woman is in my same dislike category as hairy legs on a woman.|`|VkEkCYM3aa	I don't like mohawks on anybody, guy or girl, honestly, but I don't care for it.    Make sure you can handle verbal abuse from people if you get a mohawk. There are some idiotic people out there who just won't shut up...    If you're sure, and you like it, GO FOR IT. It's your choice.|`|MurlBiOIaa	I like it...but I'm not so normal.|`|eoqTXCGxaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.    Disgusting.|`|kgdVgHeqaa	i guess as long as you have enough femininity to pull it off.    otherwise it can make you look butch|`|9yj86j0Caa	Not a guy, but i think it looks really hideous.
dTdLrjFNaa	Lightly mousse damp hair, and then lift it up while blow drying.|`|aaNZZKLraa	When blowdrying, take the dryer and put it under the hair. Use a cylinder shaped brush. Then, flat iron your hair going up.
pA4GHLXcaa	Long choppy hair with light brown highlights. Down to neck length in the back and not much bang in the front.|`|gdot0YLJaa	Just bring in the picture!|`|6iJ30wugaa	Go to the library and print it off there I think they only charge you 10 cents A copy.|`|eBwICYUMaa	go to a friends house and print it|`|LcdRdyttaa	Be a man. Shave you're head|`|l3MED8Itaa	tell him/her you want long messy choppy layers.|`|mDt03eXIaa	Take the picture. Email it to a friend to print it out, whatever you need to do, but if you;re getting anything more than a trim, you always bring in a picture, because what is "long and shaggy" to you might be completey different for the person cutting your hair. In order to be happy with it, you're going to need to bring in a visual reference.
vD5ysjwraa	I think clipons is your best bet.    If you get clipons you can take them out at night and style them however you want during the day...i think glueons-bad idea.    Ive tried them and they tend to rip your hair out and eventually ruin it and costs a lot of money to get them put in or taken out.    If you die it then thats also good except choosing the shade that suits your hair. Also you may have to redye the roots and that could be a pain.    As for whether to get proffesional clip ons or not thats really up to you...some ones that arent proffesional are just as good really.    Its basically up to you so...Good Luck =)|`|iydiOTneaa	Omigash This Is SO My Category! Haha:)  I Recently Got Purple In My Hair And So It Looks  Liek I Got The Ends Of My Hair Dipped In Purple  Its AMAZING! Haha  I Love It SO Much And My Mom Was Tellign Me To Get Clip Ins  But Truthfully Its Just Not The Same!  Actually If You Get Purple It Will Help Your Hair I Know This Sounds Crazy But If You Get Real Purple n Your Hair Your Going To have To Wash It With Luke-Warm Water So It Doesnt Fade Which Actually Isnt To Bad So Like When You Take Hot Showers Its Not So Great For Your Hair But The Colder Water Makes It Shinier And Softer:)  But You Also Have To Use Color Shampoo&Conditioner    But I Definetly Dont Regret Getting Purple In My Hair:)  Iv had It For About 3-4? Months Now And I Dont Regret it Even A Little    :)]    Oh P,S!!  To get Mine Done Was About 25$  & I Have Been To Places WHere They Sale The ClipOns And Those Are About 10-15$

AA12022764	don't buy into trends. trends are retarded as ****. be yourself. if people don't like your clothes, **** them.|`|9d83999cf64f15d5a162e5b37a3d83f3aa	Buy everything and anything from abercrombie & fitch.|`|AA12309059	My best advice is to buy things you can mix & match to make your own, but still keep up with the styles. Mini skirts and leggings are cute, faded boy jeans are comfy and look cute with any shirt.     Have fun with it, and don't buy everything from one store...Mix it up and have fun!|`|390772e083aabfaab8ef6c85c404001caa	First of all it is SENSE and not sence. Now how about working on your english spellings first before bothering about style for yourself. School is all about grades or didn't you know that ? You should have asked for a dictionary instead.HA!|`|AA10988453	trends right now, mini skirts "jean skirts",skinny jean, boy vest, big wierd necklaces, converse!, longer t shirts, hoodies, funny t-shirt saying, wavy hair, messy buns, thin heat bands or head strings with your hair up,leggings, go to alloy.com or deila.com for more trends lol|`|e288ffef823f4fcc72f31748536562f5aa	just try  having your own sence of style and wear whatever u feel good in!!!!|`|32214654b46d780f32a1224f6c04adcfaa	Well what the first person said is true....**** trends    Dress in what you like jeans are always nice and in and no one can tell you anything about em   Come on they are jeans!    Well wear nice shirts that are nice and casual but you(your taste and style)  Don't follow the herd, follow your passion in clothes...    You can always buy cute accessories at Claire's they arent that expensive and they are soooooooo cute!    You can buy some cute earrings to go with a top and just wear some jeans and you'll be fine! stop worring!    have a great time in school! Good luck shopping and remember what I said....|`|AA12304083	Your not the only one who has this problem! im worried about it too but im trying not to worry.But i am going to try to look cute. if im gonna try then you should too!|`|4cf6ba8a11094c89975cc56b37c65e23aa	Here look at this pics:
cJEhaLYKaa	You say "latest"...if by that, you mean "trendy"...    If Fashion Week has taught us anything this time around, it's that this spring's hottest lip color is...au naturel! Nudes, pinks, and peaches are the runway's biggest colors. Mark Jacobs sent models down the catwalk in light, icy shades of pink.     We've also seen a lot of browns. But for a younger, more flowery look, you definitely want to go with pink.     If you're skin tone doesn't go with the light pinks, go for darker. Diane von Furstenburg chose brighter pinks for her models for a very 80s mod look.      If all else fails, be your own person. What colors do you like best? What goes best with you?|`|qWU7huiUaa	deep reds, there very sexy. Only wear this if it compliments your skin. Could be scarey on the wrong lips ;)|`|e25c2aeebfd2f91eeda53c398b9883fbaa	moisture extreme from maybelline. great color and moisturise as well.

AA11114243	That sounds pretty cute. You could wear a pretty head band to glam it up a bit.|`|c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Try this link  -- it shows how to style your hair as well.

Cheap and good.  It make lots of bubbles, i never take a bubble bath w/ out it. Peach is my fav, but honey is good too.
8fe960abd1f73651086929a6f1d5b447aa	it's your left, but that rule hasn't really applied since like, the 80s. pierce em both! lots of guys do, i think it actually looks better than just having one|`|DySUxIn4aa	It's your left ear, aww so cute.|`|DNLJwLZqaa	don't get it pierced at all.  i think any ear piercing on a guy looks gay.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	It's YOUR left.  Not the viewers left which would be YOUR right.  "Left is right, and right is wrong" is a good rule.|`|X6wFMuu0aa	It used to be that piercing your right ear meant you were gay, but today it doesn't mean anything about your sexual orientation.  More and more guys are getting both ears pierced.  When my son had his ears pierced we never even considered having only one ear pierced.|`|Rrn7sqEwaa	Both is best one just looks uneven.  I work in Claires and I always try and convince boys to have both ears done when they come in.  I did my husbands ears for him and he assumed that he was just having his left one done but once I had him in the chair I did both.  He agrees that both ears looks much better.|`|es1aNJuraa	well if ur straight it goes on ur left ear|`|HmossOSuaa	Left if you are straight.|`|haiQ9dmpaa	It's your left ear that's 'straight' (lol sounds funny.)|`|GaorImlYaa	just get them both done. it looks wayyyy better that way.

m9H04STKaa	1) vaseline. miracle for chapped lips, skin and can be used as a shiny eye slick/clear mascara :)  2) concealer. every girl gets some spots.  3) a good facial cleanser + moisturizer. don't skimp on these - they're important for good skin, and you'll regret buying a budget brand when you break out in spots.  4) mascara. Maybelline Great Lash is a classic, and like $5 i think.  5) A scrub is good to clear dead skin cells. St. Ives Apricot Scrub is cheap, smells gooood, can be used for both body and face and is probably the best around :)|`|Aw2VZfsOaa	Mascara, Eyeliner, Lip gloss and some Foundation.|`|nxzrnzmAaa	you need foundation, powder, cover up, These take care of covering blemishes. then Mascara, Eyeliner, blush, lip stick or gloss.

df1c9eb4eb02b512add35f3ec8cade5baa	Garnier is the best as far as mildness.  But you may want to keep it trimmed and grow the color off.|`|AA11872348	Ion Brilliance, you have to buy it from the beauty supply store,like Sally's beauty supply.You don't need to use volume 20 developer,use the 10,that will make it more like a semi permanent color. You really should not keep putting color over color,especially if it is permanent. Try a nuetral tone.|`|AA11248175	I know what oyu mean .ever since I had highlights put in my hair now when I dye it back to brown it has a red tint. but I used herbal essence hair dye. It is crazy that when you go to the sallon it doens;t fix that. At the sallon they are suppose to have the good stuff tha makes it brown.|`|c844c8e8b48cc1da4c36e120932ccad0aa	anytime you die your hair, professionally or not, from dark brown to blonde, a lightener is used...that is usually some kind of bleaching product. Although the products used in a salon are much gentler on the hair than in years past, it's still very hard on the hair. What happens is the outer layer of your hair strands have been damaged and no longer lay flat. when color is applied it fills the hair with pigment molecules, but since that out layer is now open the pigment slides out easily. Before the the lightner was put on the hair there was natural pigment, much stronger than artificial colors and that's been stripped...so...it's hard to keep the color in it! Doesn't matter what kind of product you use. In my opinion, you should ONLY use semi permanent color if you put any color on at all. It's going to last as long as permanent, but not continue to damage your hair.|`|f4f56ba97868722689411a18398ef91faa	The reason it fades like that is because when you make hair blonde, your stripping the pigment from it.  If your hair doesnt have pigment it cant hold the new colour.  So after washing the colour fades out. Usually salons add a FILLER before they die back to brown and it helps the colour last longer.  I dont know much about brands in the drug store to use, because I am a professional stylist, but stay away from chesnut or warm colours, because they have the most red in them.  Use a natural colour, of if it gets really red, u might want to use something with a ASH in it.  The swatch will look ugly, but the colour will cut the gold/red tones, producing a nice natural brown|`|f61758da968f860ae50eaa1a64bd4720aa	You should not be using a permanent hair color on it every couple of mos., you are going to ruin your hair doing that. You are not supposed to color over color either.    Why don't you look for a semi-permanent color closest you your natural color, maybe a shade or two darker. It is alot better for your hair because it does not have the harsh chemicals that permanent colors do and you can do it more often.     Also w/ all the chemicals you are adding to your hair I'm sure your hair is extremely dry. You need to use a good moisturizing shampoo & conditioner. Also make sure you are getting trims every 6-10 weeks to keep the split and dry ends off.    With dying your hair every couple of mo. the hair becomes over stressed and will reach a snapping point, you really need to be careful w/ over coloring the hair.    Good Luck,    Stylist of 9 yrs.|`|AA10712883	Yikes!  If you want that brassy colour out of your hair, then you are going to have to either let it grow out or cut it out because processed hair is damaged hair.  Returning your colour to the natural colour will require the type of maintenance you are doing now.  You bleached hair cannot hold any hair colour right now and if you are not careful with what type of dye you put in it, you could possible melt it.  I have seen that and it is not pretty.    So you go to your hair stylist one more time.  You ask her what hair dye brand she uses and what colour she uses.  Then ask her to teach/show you how to properly do a self-application of the hair dye.  Get the timing and anything else you can think of.  She can do a glamour bath on your hair weekly to keep the colour from fading as fast.  Once the self-applied application is complete see if she will sale you the hair colour and developer to you.  You will also need a list of supplies to do it at your home in order to save money.      You need to stick with the same hair dye you are using now so there won't be any negative reaction like your hair melting.  Stay away from the grocery store hair dye!  Trust me.  Bad news.  If all else fails, then remember that hair always grows back!      Be blessed!

c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Here are some hairstyles that you can try while you are growing your hair out. Since you have an oval face you can wear ANY hairstyle.

You never have to buy the magazine. : )|`|c2ac0bdbb3bf9f32ed811f68c4687138aa	You dont have to let it grow out too long. About 3-4 inches past your shoulders.

When it's wet it is has more elasticity and is more open to damage.  Also brush from the bottom of the hair strand up towards your scalp to prevent split ends and tearing up the hair cuticle.  Also, large tooth combs are better than brushes.  The brush (unless you get the plastic kinds with balls on the end of the bristle) roughs up the hair.  The combs do significantly less damage.|`|d7b7c32b1b2cd119ae2856a4e291d2c5aa	yes it is help to your hair

Poi prima di eliminarlo, togliere l'eccesso con un batuffolo di ovatta, sciacquare abbondantemente e poi passare il tonico e solo successivamente la crema idratante.

c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Make sure you trim off the split ends. I'm going to include step by step what I used from pantene - and it WORKED on my hair - granted it took a few days for the product to really start affecting my hair but the results are AWESOME.  Shampoo    Before getting into the shower, gently brush or finger-comb your hair to loosen up tangles and residue.    Wet hair and pour a small amount of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Shampoo into your palm.    Rub your hands together and gently massage into the roots using the tips of your fingers. (Careful! Vigorous rubbing can cause strands to break.)    If you wear makeup, pay special attention to the hairline.    Rinse thoroughly with warm water to remove all of the shampoo.  Condition    Conditioning is key to creating shine and preserving hair health.    After shampooing, carefully remove excess moisture by squeezing your hair with a towel. (Be gentle. Rubbing and twisting with a towel can break the hair.)    Squeeze a small blob of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Complete Therapy Conditioner on your palm and spread it over your hands, then apply it to your hair.    For super shine, condition the entire strand, starting at the roots.    For volume, condition only the middle and ends of your hair, where it's most susceptible to damage.  Styling    It's easier to apply styling products to hair that's just damp, so towel off first.    Squeeze a palmful of Pantene Get It Straight Gel or Smooth Down Frizz Control Smoothing Crme into your hands and rub them together.    Distribute the styling formula evenly by "clapping" sections of hair between your flat hands and gently pulling downward.    Blow-dry    Use the hot setting on all of your hair to accelerate the drying.    When hair is about half dry divide it into sections so you can concentrate the blow dryer and brush on one area.    Use clips to divide the top front and sides, then blow-dry them one at a time using a flat brush (smaller bristles work best). Once the top and sides are finished, you can move to the back.    A flat paddle brush works best. Its wide surface area spreads hair out and keeps it taut, which aids in the straightening process.    Follow the brush with the blow dryer, keeping the blow dryer about five inches away from the hair.    Too much heat can cause damage. Once hair is mostly dry, reduce the heat and add a nozzle. Start from the roots and follow the brush down, keeping the hair taut but not stretched too tightly. The cooler air locks in the style you want.    Set Your Style    A generous spritz of Pantene Stay Smooth Hairspray Flexible Hold will keep your smooth look in place for hours.|`|29ae5ded3b8c7790827d33fde1b7d069aa	i have really thick and frizzy hair and i use the Dove anti frizz cream. its like $5 at cvs.|`|AA10610800	use products from John Freida Frizz Ease it works well|`|78d41165ab1cdc127052de81b1a13398aa	u should use a cream for ur hair....it gets frizzy bc it is dry so u need to put in some moisture!!|`|AA11941039	Glass by Redken is really good for controoling frizz.

Idk about the weight though (to me you sound skinny already but the modeling industry is crazy about weight).|`|UMIRn2f6aa	yea.  the minimum is 5'7".  and your weight is okayy.  :)

c844c8e8b48cc1da4c36e120932ccad0aa	It's called "bleeding" and it's very hard to prevent. When lifting dark brown hair to blonde you create a lot of porosity, or damage, to the hair which makes it much like a sponge. Red haircolors tend to fade...which means the color is lifting out of the hair. The reds need to be thoroughly rinsed!!! When you think it's rinsed enough, rinse some more. If you're using temperary colors there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. If it's permanent red you can try using a clear semi or demi color right after doing the red and blonde. The clear might...I say might...seal the red and prevent so much bleeding. You also want to make sure you keep that blonde hair conditioned so that it's less dry and porous. MOST of those pictures you see of hair colors with colors like that are NOT real. They use clip in hair pieces....and that might be something for you to look into. Take them out before you shampoo your hair.|`|80b79af4085489d8edba40c0097fa3ebaa	its pretty inevitable....but buy color safe shampoo, such as herbal essencces color me happy.|`|AA10796963	I dye my hair red and blonde at the same time at least a couple times a year. So this is how we do it. Make sure that you wrap the seperate colors in foil just like they do at the salon. and when you rinse use cold water and I mean cold as cold as you can stand it. It will at least help prevent 95% of the initial bleed when you take the foil out. Use a color safe shampoo and be careful how hot the water is that you use to wash it for at LEAST the first week or two. I have found pretty good results doing all of these with each dying.|`|cd20c638bc682a85ddb56d6620b71430aa	Use a toner.|`|AA10210050	dont dye your hair very bright red|`|f4f56ba97868722689411a18398ef91faa	Im assuming the blonde colour is in a foil?  Or how are you dying around it.  Whenever I dye hair red and blonde, I put the blonde in foils, and dye the remainder red.  You have to rinse the red out very well before you remove the foils.  If you are not having foils, you should just wrap the blonde peices at home in tin foil to prevent the colour from bleeding.
AA12131463	Yeah. Go to Libby Lu. They will employ the desperate wannabes like you! Good Luck! XD|`|AA12376695	wow, i heard sears was looking for desperate wanna bes like you.

GWoW1o5oaa	You can loose up to 1000 strands of hair daily.  Hair follicles only produce hair for a certain time, and then they must rest.  The hair falls out.  Up to 30% of your follicles are at rest at any one time.      Make sure you are eating properly.  Use a good shampoo and conditioner.  If you recently have started taking medications or changed them, this can cause hair loss.  Dyes, perms, relaxers or other treatment can irritate the skin and the hair falls out    If the hair is falling out in clumps, see a dermatologist.  If the hair is forming a bald spot at the crown of your head, it's male pattern baldness.  Try Rogaine.  If you have a receding hairline, forehead back; you are SOL.|`|g16H2B5Taa	That happened to my sister. You might need more protein or something.

It really depends on what your styles is. I don't want to recommend something that would look ugly on you.
SDVmaOExaa	I think it would be fine. Plenty of people don't wear suits to these types of events, plus your outfit sounds like it would look nice (though I'm not sure about the notebook and pen).
jez0O0bXaa	Didn't your stylist recommend products to help reconsruct your hair?  Try Joico/K-Pak products they are amazing and will maintain and repair.  Also Paul Michell Super Skinny Serum.  Also Biotin supplement you can get at most stores will help you hair, nails & skin.  Try these things and within a month you should be able to get highlights back.  You will have to use bleach to lift the brown dye but since you are a natural blonde once you get enough new growth and need a retouch use a hi-lift color dye, so much gentler on your hair.  Good Luck!

v1zyfea5aa	First, you have beautiful features.  Second, wear you hair forward to frame your face.  You might even want to consider bangs of a fashion or letting your hair fall over one eye.  It would be very becoming for you. Third, change your base or foundation to a little less stark.  Fourth, in truth, if you are trying to attract a certain guy, you will find, the way you act is more important than how you look.  Act sweet, attentive, and most of all demure.|`|iver1TLWaa	i think you should wear foundation, and also i think you should get your hair cut & styled, like layers and side bangs or somethinggg. x|`|CVQa88Ujaa	You look like a girl from the 80's why do you have you hair in that pony tail.

nisfxpXHaa	Normally retailers sell off previous seasons clothing at the end of that season. They ship it to outlets to clear out space in the full price stores, condensing it at the outlets.     So if it was a summer line for 2008 it was probably sent to the outlets in August and September of 2008. To clear out space for the back to school/fall lines.    Normally when the clothes arrive at the outlets they are at a first markdown. The same price the full price store was selling them for right before shipping them to the outlet stores. The outlets will keep them at that first markdown if they are selling well, once the sales start to slow down then they will start to mark them down or offer additional % markdowns at the register.    I have never know a retailer to hold onto last years summer line to offer at a discount the following summer. This would defeat their goal of selling their new full price summer line. Also retailers are charged by the square footage on their leases, therefor they just don't have the physical space to store merchandise that isn't on the sales floor.    Hope this helps.

2b961fc45683e07b0865e84fc53581e4aa	Yes, witch hazel works.  It is not as drying to your skin like alcohol or alcohol based toners.  It is very inexpensive.  It can be purchased at any drug store or grocery store.  You will usually find it by the alcohol and hydrogen peroxide.  Wash you face with facial cleanser and warm water.  Splash cold water on your face or rub an ice cube over your face. (This helps to minimize your pores).  Apply the witch hazel with a clean cotton ball(Make sure that it is a cotton ball and not one of the inexpensive fiber puffs).  I would follow with an oil free moisturizer or Shea Butter.|`|ZS1e50dMaa	yes it is great it also helps make bruises go away faster and minor cuts and scrapes. but used as a facial clenser make sure that you use oil of oly or something like that to keep face morsturised|`|AA11374313	its good for an astigigent but you should also put on acne medication on it because it will dry up your face alot. also put some light oil free moisturzier after you put on acne medication so the medication and witch hazel wont dry up ur face completely making the pores produce more oil.|`|c4205b47b160efa1a722d74a8f7e5621aa	ya, its great!!  go for it!!  ohh and its in the First-Aid/bandaids area of drugstores!!  hope i helped!|`|9ee31f6ad55abff4de3f8f5aaae5508daa	You can pick up Witch Hazel almost at any drug stores|`|YTWMmITtaa	witch hazel is good I used it, but it dries up your skin so you might want to have a face lotion you can get that a stores, but it works for me.

yKQKzKwMaa	The wisest thing to do would probably be to consider the true reasons why you want to change your hair color. Are you looking to reinvent yourself? Are you trying to find what might look best for you? Both? Well, there's lots to consider... many hair dye products contain harsh chemicals that can do some serious damage to your locks. After reasoning with your parents that dying your hair would boost your self-image, try looking for a less harsh brand [Garnier is awesome!] or one simply without ammonia. Stick to only 2 shades lighter or darker than your natural color! Also, what looks best next to your skin: gold jewelry, or silver? If gold, your skin is warm-toned. Silver indicates a cool-tone. For warm tones, stick to shades with hints of gold or amber in them. For the cool ones, any reds or colors mentioning the word 'ash' should fit the bill. Afterwards, you'll need to maintain this color every month. It sounds lengthy, but with proper reasoning and a good color-protecting shampoo and conditioner like L'oreal Color Vive, [The red bottle!] you'll be on your way.|`|gnHHMRdBaa	hold a knife to ur neck all the way to the salon, haha idk write a pursuasive essay|`|7auwtT2taa	LOL how old r u anyway?  if u r under 13 den yea its young...  bdw why u wanna die yr blond hair brown? ppl KILL 2 hav blond hair u no|`|TyqncG8Gaa	well there are a few ways    1) dramatic.   dye your hair like black at your friends house, parents will freak, maybe take you to a salon, say you won't dye it back w/o the highlights.    2) less dramatic.  save up money and go by yourself. there are no age restrictions, not like getting a tattoo.    3) just bug them and bug them until they give in, worked for my nose ring, but may take a long while. try doing deals, good grades, whatever|`|AA11331190	You could always experiment yourself with something like kool aide to add color.

Dl1uS5CLaa	hmmm, i think that sometime it helps  i remember last year i was soo ugly and needed to do my eyebrows. like. BAD! and i was like what can i do to improve of my appearance and someone said eye brows in a nice way,  and it helped so i like when that happens  also someone said to "put down the fork" not nice. i like cried, but if u post pictures you should know there are some jerks and they might answer.  and it helped so i like when that happens  but when people are pretty and they OBVIOUSLY know it then its like wtf? no stop messing around u probably have like 2,000 others at your school saying you're gorgeous!    but i totally agree!   i try not to think to much of it.  but i liked this question (:      Edit:  seriously, people who INSULT the people who actually do this that's annoying. i actually feel bad for them. i find it a little annoying when there gorgeous but the people who are like just average or below... everyone wants to fit in weather you like it or not, but ranting isn't going to make it better with insulting worlds.   sorry but that's how i feel, yet i could be completely off because i am still young, a 14 year old but still.|`|uvt0opzdaa	Ive done it before...I only did it because Ive never had confidence in myself before...Of course it didnt really help that much but I felt a tiny bit better after...No one ever compilments me on anything and if someone does, its usually something like "your earings are nice" or something.

I do think its stupid when girls who know there pretty do it though...They just like showing off and stuff making the girls who dont know that there pretty feel really bad.|`|jmgarxS3aa	It can get quite annoying, I agree. Especially since practically every other question is a question asking if they are pretty or not. Sometimes they actually do need to ask the question for important reasons, like a girl was asking if she was pretty enough to model, and those questions aren't nearly as annoying, since they have a reason for asking.    I am most annoyed with the girls that you look at their picture and you know that they know they are pretty. They just have this certain look  and way of confidence, and you can tell. That really does get annoying especially since they are obviously fishing for compliments.    If they need to ask, and there is a good reason other than "I am bored", then it's fine, but the rest are pretty annoying.    ...

If you don't like the questions, why not just ignore them? There is no requirement that you answer all questions.    I just looked at such a question where the answers were insulting and demeaning of the person. Many were cruel. Why would anyone find it necessary to say something hurtful.    Does it really matter why they ask these questions. Many of the girls ask, as you indicated, because they are insecure and feel unattractive. They come here to an anonymous forum to ask what they wouldn't ask in real life.    When a person is that insecure, why would any of us want to break their spirit?    I am a regular on R & S. There are many intentionally annoying questions there. I simply ignore them. I don't respond with insults nor do I respond by telling them the question in annoying.    Most thirteen year old girls feel awkward and unattractive. I just don't understand the need to hurt them.    And for the record, as a youth pastor for many years and a pastor who still works closely with youth, some of the prettiest girls are the most insecure about their looks.

The already silly grade school drama gets only worse with the lack of respect for the reader or stupidity with which they spell.    I think YA! seriously needs a kiddie category, where they all should post the "OMG what does it mean that that boy looked at me when I bumped my head into him?" and "Am I pretty?" questions.    Now, I am not saying that ALL questions from kids should be so categorized. Just the ones above.

m2ARO4ZIaa	1- if you have oily skin, thats bound to happen with your bangs all rubbing on your face all day   2- Make sure when you shampoo you emphasize on the scalp (where the oil comes out) and the bangs.  3- When your conditioning, avoid the bangs and only do the ends of the hair. NOT the scalp, ever. That's how your hair gets greasy.   4- Thats about it, depends on your hygenic regime|`|F3xAtqTQaa	if you touch your bangs during the day alot.. the greasyness can result from that.  you could try an oil-free moisturizer too.. because your bangs could be rubbing against your forehead and get greasy from that.|`|orsqT9q9aa	when i dont wan tmy hair to get greasy i dont use conditioner and dont put in any products after u shower|`|mQHsFx62aa	you should wash your hair with dove more often|`|Uxs2wy7Haa	easy wash your hair more often

Maybe you don't realize it but some probably do look at you. You probably are nice looking and thats why the brown skinned girls look at you. Color shouldn't be an issue. Don't let it bother you. At least the other girls notice and smile at you, so they must see something.|`|a1cb51d34aa084283d142ecb31bdf4eaaa	I think the best would be to let go of the question. Whether white or brown cannot tell you the colour of the heart. Since those who don't look at you are eliminating themselves from your world, they really don't exist. What a shame to let your heart ache over that which was not to be.     My advice? Smile back and see where it takes you.

b7BQV3XNaa	I've used the same hair dye brand and product that you're using- and I'm sure that it's applied to dry hair.  Leave it on for 5 minutes longer just to be sure that you get the best colour coverage.    Make sure that you don't wash your hair beforehand, though, or have any styling products in it. The dye washes your hair at the same time as dyeing it.    Oh, and you won't need two dyes, don't worry.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	Put it on dry hair and leave for the recommended time it says. Good luck!|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	Like the other poster said, you should have gotten, especially if your hair is thick. To answer your question, you would apply it to dry hair. Usually the time suggested is there for a reason. The important factor here, is saturation. You have to make sure every strand gets tinted.colored. Is your hair long by chance? If so, i would suggest two boxes for a complete saturation. You 'can' leave it on for a little longer, but not by much. Good luck.|`|c1f7a659ef314c657340ba178c779d82aa	Look at the leaflet|`|bf85fc1fa1e258360c2abd654d161748aa	I use the permanent and it says to apply it to dry, unwashed hair that is free from styling products|`|dTG5UXACaa	i think you should of gotten two dyes  cause ones barely enough for me and i have thin hair|`|Tjr9aObNaa	All dies go on dry hair.

39295cfdbdb09b599a9183b8ec8f56d1aa	Nothing will get you muscle fast especially if you have a lot of fat. I would mix cardio and strength training in your excercise routine. Kickboxing does both and is an excellent total body workout. Do cardio about 4 times a week always finish with abs and then do strength training(lifting weights for example) 2-3 times a week. The key is cardio because you have to lose fat before you gain muscle.|`|2c509ce080c6258454932169280d44beaa	When you find out tell me.  JK.  But on a seriouse note...  Cardio.  Weigths.  It will never be fast to do it. It takes time...  && concentration just keep going. && good luck.|`|c410aaadcae447fe464fc7fd07fe587caa	Well I hope that you have a gym membership (or even soup cans can help as well.) Doing lunges, sit ups, pushups, bench press (sitting on back of a chair and pushing yourself up) Do tons of cardio. If you do have a chance to go to Target... buy THE FIRM series. Guaranteed results in 10 workouts. Also - to speed up the results, run about 30 min everyday. It will be hard but if you want to look slightly different in 3 weeks it should work out. Also, cut out anything fatty. I know this is pretty basic info but hey it works. Check out www.firmdirect.com if you want any insight. They use weightlifting for maximum results (but as a beginner you want to use either 1 lb or no weights at all) It works REALLY good but you have to put a lot of effort in it. Good luck, I wish you all the best!

Grains and things will keep your body feeling fuller for longer bc it takes longer to digest than greens.. although greens are obviously definitely the healthier route. They will also make you feel a lot better.. you are eating healthy foods, and are happy knowing that you are only doing your body good by eating more of them.|`|187a1e2efcaff27219afd8edffb5be71aa	please better dont try out these kind of pills .they are just fake.never trust them.|`|64632d1ac313268ef4e126c16a3d7c1eaa	nope|`|c5c62aac78a1bc2eeab8ee43ec7d41cbaa	No, and I suggest you research zetacap thoroughly before you try to use it.

I'm going to include step by step what I used from pantene - and it WORKED on my hair - granted it took a few days for the product to really start affecting my hair but the results are AWESOME.  Shampoo    Before getting into the shower, gently brush or finger-comb your hair to loosen up tangles and residue.    Wet hair and pour a small amount of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Shampoo into your palm.    Rub your hands together and gently massage into the roots using the tips of your fingers. (Careful! Vigorous rubbing can cause strands to break.)    If you wear makeup, pay special attention to the hairline.    Rinse thoroughly with warm water to remove all of the shampoo.  Condition    Conditioning is key to creating shine and preserving hair health.    After shampooing, carefully remove excess moisture by squeezing your hair with a towel. (Be gentle. Rubbing and twisting with a towel can break the hair.)    Squeeze a small blob of Pantene Smooth & Sleek Complete Therapy Conditioner on your palm and spread it over your hands, then apply it to your hair.    For super shine, condition the entire strand, starting at the roots.    For volume, condition only the middle and ends of your hair, where it's most susceptible to damage.  Styling    It's easier to apply styling products to hair that's just damp, so towel off first.    Squeeze a palmful of Pantene Get It Straight Gel or Smooth Down Frizz Control Smoothing Crme into your hands and rub them together.    Distribute the styling formula evenly by "clapping" sections of hair between your flat hands and gently pulling downward.    Blow-dry    Use the hot setting on all of your hair to accelerate the drying.    When hair is about half dry divide it into sections so you can concentrate the blow dryer and brush on one area.    Use clips to divide the top front and sides, then blow-dry them one at a time using a flat brush (smaller bristles work best). Once the top and sides are finished, you can move to the back.    A flat paddle brush works best. Its wide surface area spreads hair out and keeps it taut, which aids in the straightening process.    Follow the brush with the blow dryer, keeping the blow dryer about five inches away from the hair.    Too much heat can cause damage. Once hair is mostly dry, reduce the heat and add a nozzle. Start from the roots and follow the brush down, keeping the hair taut but not stretched too tightly. The cooler air locks in the style you want.    Set Your Style    A generous spritz of Pantene Stay Smooth Hairspray Flexible Hold will keep your smooth look in place for hours.|`|068824a38197ecb728bc57f541ce7109aa	scrunch it ..use gel/mouse/hairspary....|`|a57b57fdbf46fa4a76b481cdeec68dd0aa	u shud ask a black g for best advice|`|66e91d18a7267a4ccdb0a59e2bad7881aa	try putting your hair up in a cute way or braiding it for tomorrow. then next time you go to your hair stylist get your hair thinned, layered or even permed straight.|`|2495c152f0e3de21ea37f3b5a81536deaa	ask some one for your shampoo. shampoo can do any thing if they matched with your hairs.|`|3c2e3184547f87174cbb211637a08e9baa	Well if you have thick hair, don't wash it everyday.

Then in the morning I will take it out when its completely dry and it is really wavy and pretty. You can put a little bit of mousse in it to help but not toomuch because it might weigh it down.

First off, if I wanted to go cheap, then I would attempt to do it myself.  I would go and buy the various colors I wanted in the store, and just carefully pick out various strands on my head and apply the color I wanted for each strand.  Most of the boxes at the store can be rinsed out around the same time, so you should be ok as far as that goes.  But honestly, if you have the extra money, it would be much easier and probably better results to go and pay a professional to do it.  Let them deal with the mess!!!  :-)  Hope that helps, but that's what I'd do.

e428d15f854e758c071edcf20619a514aa	I have been taking hair supplements for the past 3 years and here is what I have found.  GNC makes a tablet called "Ultra Nourishair" in formulas for men and women, the pills are taken daily, 2 pills a day. They are HUGE and very hard to swallow, if you have any trouble at all with large tablets, then I wouldn't recommend these. The 2 pills also contain only 1200 micrograms total of Biotin, which is the main supplement needed for hair to grow faster and stronger. You should try to get a minimum of 2500 micrograms of Biotin daily to improve hair's rate of growth and its condition.  ProCaps labs makes a great supplement called "Hair Skin and Nails" formula, here is the link for that   http://www.procapslabs.com/pcl/pages/pro...  This is in capsule form and much easier to swallow. This company, ProCaps labs is also extremely reputable and carries pure and effective products.  I took GNC's Nourishair for four months, and supplemented it with extra Biotin tablets daily due to its low Biotin content. I took 2500 micrograms extra Biotin with the GNC pills.  The Procaps hair vites have 2500 micrograms of Biotin in them, and don't really require extra Biotin be taken, but I do take an additional 2500 micrograms of Biotin for a daily total of 5000 micrograms of Biotin.  My hair is growing in thick and dark and quite quickly. My hair used to be very slow growing, but all of these supplements have really made a difference.  The only way to really change the health of your hair is by taking supplements that work internally on the follicle where hair is made, any shampoos or oils or other topically applied things do nothing to change hair's structure, that can only happen with systemically provided support, which means supplements that you take internally.......|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	Your hair grows at 1/2 inch a month, nothing will change that.|`|500f5cf207b839911cca33c8c0eaee7caa	I heard prenatal vitamins helps hair and nails grow fast because of the folic acid.

It's like wrinkles- once a wrinkle is there, it's there forever. You can do things to make it less noticeable, but it will be there once you stop whatever process you are using.   Hair grows on average a half inch a month. You can try things like volumizing shampoos/conditioners to make it look thicker and longer, and some vitamins may help it look healthier. Regular trimming removes damaged and split ends, making it look smoother, thus longer. That's probably what the camella oil is doing.|`|d8cff765ec00cfc8e32e5b33eba9c598aa	prenatal pills|`|6aec9c590ebdd5cbd7bcd793bcd2980aaa	don't take pre natal pills, that will just mess your hoimeones up. get a haircut|`|79021a61b2485597895a8b7c76eff4c4aa	ok seriously. use horse shampoo. trust me on this. it makes it grown twice as fast!!|`|6e483c39a53902ea752e8c3fdfcb9ca9aa	Prenatal vitamins does the trick..it also makes your nails longer,and stronger too.....so your in luck!|`|d6ea7ec6c2653ece1d52153615177419aa	I've never heard of it, but I would try it too. you can take prenatal vitamins or go to wallgreens or rite aid and get hair skin and nail vitamins it's a dark brown bottle with a purple label in the womens health section. i've tried them, they work, they also make your finger nails stronger.|`|AA11382756	nair for men-- shampoo your hair with it and it will grow back in a jiffy|`|4fe78b33faccf16d85423c830f5af476aa	Biotin really helps.
bcc39280315e118c2fe72229530f4e75aa	Back in the days, "preps" came from the term "preppy".  Which, in turn, came from a schoolboy look of old prepartory schools ("prep schools").  It was standard fare- nice slacks, dress shirt, tie and jacket.  Not really a suit, but a uniform-type way of dressing.  A good example would be private school uniforms from England, circa mid 70's to present.    Then, along came Ralph Lauren, who took the traditional, classic look and updated it to make it more fashionably appealing.  Tommy Hilfiger also delved into this "prep" look by adding a twist as well- suddenly, you had people wearing khaki shorts, penny loafers, button up oxfords and deep cut v-neck knit sweaters wrapped around your waist with the a brown leather weave belt.     Since it was coming from Ralph Lauren, a semi-established American designer, and Tommy Hilfiger, a newly established designer at the time, it was prevalent in departments stores all across the country.  It was more than the Gap, there was no Old Navy in the 80's (except for a couple outlets- back then, Old Navy was the outlet branch of Gap).  So, richer kids would pick them up, because of the higher pricepoint appeal.  This "mini" social status was evident in suburban high schools all over the country, and since it was reminiscent of the prepatory school days of Europe and other elite private schools in the country, the term "preppy" and "prep" was born.    The Gap embraced this look during the 1990's- khaki, basic shirts (button ups and short sleeves), heavy knit sweaters and brown accessories dominated the Gap shelves, before buying out Banana Republic sometime in the early to mid 90's.  Banana Republic (BR) was an outdoorsy, quality goods type of store ( with display cards stating "The Ernest Hemingway shorts will provide comfort in the great outdoors..."), before it got picked up by the Gap.  However, due to its quality goods, a lot of prep shopping was done here.  Also, in line with this is Abercrombie and Fitch (AF).  AF used to be a camping, outdoors store.  Based in the Northeast, it had its roots in outdoors stuff- camping gear could be bought here.  The clothes were expensive, due to its use of quality materials and workmanship.  Again, preps tend to gravitate towards clothing that had a higher level of status- so AF was popular back in the days.  However, AF was bought out by the same group that owns Victoria's Secret.  And the style has evolved into what we know today.    So, due to its roots in prep style, AF can sometimes be mistaken as a prep type store- which, due to its expensive stuff, may be true, in a financial sense.  However, the overall style is not preppy.  HCO is owned by the same company that owns AF, but is aimed at the younger crowd- which is why some of their clothes is small, although it should be larger.    All in all, fashion changes over the time, and true preps with striped ties, button up oxfords untucked with a v-neck sweater, accompanied by knee high khaki shorts and white socks with brown Cole Haan penny loafers are almost non-existent- the style may have changed, but I guess the term just means something different today|`|0a4d660f5b346a12e0fb0ae5eaa8db0eaa	after they all wanted to be "the best" they tried to out-do each other, so they got obsessed with having "better" clothes than anyony else...now they turned into the people everyone hate besause of all the backstabbing everyone recives from them!|`|d18e9b0d9759857f72955359c8f8a766aa	Rich Suburbia with Tiffany's and SUVs.

It is only a little pinch. Just sharpen the end of the stud. Just remember to sterilize with alcohol.|`|AA11118856	Don't know how much it would cost (materials change costs) but it sounds like it would look pretty cool!|`|AA10451155	Yes it hurts.  It hurts a lot,  not as much as the nose, but it hurts.  I got four done at once, around my belly button, so the guy cut me a deal.  If you get more than one, see what you can talk him(her) into.  Otherwise it is probably the same as a naval.|`|63yyMSNdaa	Don't do this. They will grow out and you will be left with ugly scar tissue. I know because my friend did that.|`|XREOZf9Maa	So do you mean like several piercings around your belly button?   I have my belly button pierced ( just one piercing) and it did hurt.   It wasnt like I am dying pain! But it wasnt a blast either. LOL..

It may deposit tones such as red or violet but that will only be seen in the light. it wont be able to lift your hair to a lighter level.|`|vsEWHCuhaa	It works best on Blond it may not show up at all on black. The colour of the kool-aid has to be darker then your hair colour. good luck! xx|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	No, i have black hair and have tried.

Maybe they want to be fashion rebels or something, I really have no clue. Either way, they just don't look right. I've always wondered where they bought them; in the women's department maybe? (Not trying to be catty, I'm genuinely curious)

atAwNvDfaa	Hi :)  My hair used to be like that. When you take a shower, don't use a lot of shampoo and conditioner, just use a little bit. Also don't put conditioner in your roots, only on your ends. Greasiness could be caused by not drying your hair or sweating. But know that your hair naturally releases oils and it is good. Hope I helped :)|`|vi2bzq0Caa	purchase a shampoo that is sulfate-free.   Also, purchase a conditioner that is fruit infused.    Recommendations: www.essentious.com  The shampoo and conditioner are $35.00 each for 16 oz sizes. For 8 oz sizes, the shampoo and conditioner are $25.00 bucks each (or $20.00, not sure).     Also, you can visit your local Walgreens while there is a sale this week and purchase the Biofusion conditioning shampoo and deep penetrating conditioner.     You can also purchase Neutrogena's Triple Renewal Shampoo, Conditioner, Daily Moisture (jar), and Silk Therapy Lotion. Very affordable. The highest you will pay for is the conditioner, which is $9.85.|`|Kq2rFuIyaa	dry shampoo. you can buy it at sephora|`|agiDmsA3aa	use head and shoulders shampoo. and blowdry your hair as soon as you get in the shower. try to keep it more fluffed up and not flat against your hair. to do your bangs have your hair parted far to the side and pull your bangs over and train them to stay. also brush your hair about once every two hours|`|tbCNI9OTaa	1.) you wouldnt want hair like hers|`|J9OUW7JRaa	Demi Lovato is sooo ugly! dont ever try to look like her!  seriously shes like so ugly and she has a stlyist and people to make her look pretty and shes still ugly!  you really think thats cute:  http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll80/...  http://www.disneysociety.com/wp-content/...

iv0NzPTNaa	Very cute dress. A good tip for shopping that a good friend told me once: If you have to question whether you should get it or not then you probably just shouldn't get it. Only spend money on things that you know for sure you want.|`|w8KQzxa1aa	if u like the navy one get that cuz its pretty much the same price but the dress in the pic is really cute|`|HDZUdFPUaa	no you can get somthing just like that at target for like 10$|`|x3f04zkOaa	i think it is....  but a more beautiful   thing for the beach would be..  http://www.kaboodle.com/reviews/mermaid-...  im real though.  :)  -Mermaid Molly?|`|p5O1pCyJaa	I think its okay nothing more,   but if it fits you perfectly and everything and you like it go for it|`|ZHcNjAA1aa	Yes, it's really cute and the color is just, i guess you could say happy.

Depends on if you like looking pregnant and if you have 40.00 to waste. Sorry, but you asked!|`|Dl1uS5CLaa	well its not what we think but how much you wear it.  guess how many times in a month you would wear it,  then talk the prize  and divide how much it is to how much you would wear it.    example 1 :   i would wear this dress 5 times per month.  this dress is 40 dollars.  40/5=8  8 dollars per month. (like if you renting it or something)  thats good!!! :)     example 2:  i would wear this dress 1 times per month.  this dress is 40 dollars.  40/1=8  40 dollars a month.   no good. dont buy  but its really what you personally are willing to spend because i dont know how much money you have.  thats what i would do. its a cute dress too!  hope i helped!|`|zTYFysk0aa	If it's not the one you want then don't get it but since it seems to make you feel pretty by the way it fits I would just suggest waiting until you get a coupon or they go on sale.

KzWTFnQaaa	DON'T DO IT. Nice & Easy or Nice & Nasty as I like to call them, contain far more metallic salts than any other hair dye, which, although you may not see on the outside, ruin your hair! Yes they may make your hair look shiny & contain a load of crap about how good it is for your hair on the box, but as a hairdresser, I've dont tests and I've seen peoples hair after years of using nice and easy, looks alright, but snaps when you try and colour it with anything else, fails the incompatibility tests to have a perm/colour or any other chemical treatment. It makes the hair extremely porous which creates uneven result if you ever decided to change your hair colour, and you will notice the change as you style your hair over the months. Ok, maybe one application isn't a  big deal, but then what? Another application.. and another for retouch? Or an uneven result if you change brand.. before you colour don't use head and shoulders shampoo or any conditioner, this creates a coating and the colour doesn't really lift as much. If your set on dying your hair, dye it the same colour but with a different brand, Loreal or Live is always the best. (Koleston Perfect from Sallys hair shop if your opting for a proffesional and affordable colour) It's what we use in the salon. Good luck!|`|VKLyDiQ7aa	I really like it.  It seriously takes only 10 minutes for really great color.  It's not as harsh smelling as other box dyes, and it leaves my hair shinier (and less stinky!) than other boxes.  I've read that it doesn't harm your hair nearly as bad as other permanent dyes.  And also, the color on the box is almost exactly what you get, unlike some other hair dyes that come out darker, or redder than they show.  Go for it!

qCPnoKy2aa	Maybe not. They may be able to purchase wholesale bags direct from the manufacturer. I have heard of the site before and I do think they are legitimate. :) Congratulations!
UAyRiEGwaa	yess it is.  the better quality her flats are, the longer  they can last without starting to make her feet smell.  after awhile, you have to throw flats out if they start  to make your feet smelly.  i would suggest buying her a new pair of cute flast =)|`|KAkeAyOJaa	Yes they can do that.  But your supposed to weird flats socks w/ them|`|YHQgtP3paa	You can try to ask your girlfriend to wear tights. Hhahas (:|`|aDG8EteIaa	She's should be wearing some type of sock or stocking with them or they can become really rank.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	LMAO Mine smell like tires when I wear ballet flats :D|`|M1vcUoo5aa	YESS !!!!!!! i wear them and when i take them off i can smell my feet.. but put dryer sheets in them before adn after you wear them.. they will smell better!|`|C0pk4kgJaa	Yes, that happens to me too. Since your feet are closed in there they tend to sweat, which they smell bad once you take them off.|`|SyagBw4Qaa	Definitely, don't make fun of her for it!|`|TOoNHNv9aa	yeah, it is common.    just have her sprinkle some baby powder in her shoes. =)|`|4e2gb3BQaa	yes|`|rXInAcURaa	when they are wet from like, the beach and then they dry with feet in them yeah they smell|`|L5aqTDiDaa	um, tell her to put baby powder in them.  it helps.|`|0ec8fbf4c085e425c25832756503bfcfaa	Bad smell is produced by the combination of sweat and dirt. If your girlfriend walks barefoot before she wears her flats she's carring dirt inside the flats. Even a small amount of dirt can cause a terrible smell. Tell your girlfriend to wash her flats (if it's possible), clean her feet (toes and nails included) and to avoid touching the floor barefoot. That's all.    (forgive my english, I'm Spanish)

J388J29Waa	i thought the purple almost black is what you wanted :S  but if u want it to be more purple it will prolly get lighter after the times that you wash it . cuz the colour gets lighter the longer its in your hair, alot of the dye runs out in the shower    i wanna seeeeeeee

They look comfy too.|`|phmU9zGkaa	they are ok im not liking the color though.|`|q7WpweJZaa	Their very cute, nice shape. they look quite comfortable too. they'd look lovely with nice jeans and a simple top.    they remind me of like, summer, for some odd reason (:|`|PbO8mpW6aa	very cute girl u have really good taste|`|nZpGi3zyaa	they're cute. but the color is eww. thats what i think|`|xgMjdWF0aa	They are very cute and adorable. I would say you should pair them with skinny jeans or straight leg jeans. You could also wear them with a mini skirt.   Also, you should pair them with light clothing so that you don't take away from the casual/cool look of the shoes. Tans, browns, gentle greens, and dark, but settle reds would look with the shoes.     I bet you will look gorgeous in the shoes!    I hope my advice helps...
atAwNvDfaa	I usually wear my hair straight, but it is very easy for me to wear it curly also. All you have to do is take a shower at night and then when your out of the shower scrunch your hair while it is still wet and don't blow dry it. Then go to sleep but don't sleep on your hair. Then in the morning your hair will turn out curly, dry, and non frizzy. (Careful, if you try this in the morning, your hair will get frizzy). Also, your hair smells really good and it looks natural and feels soft.   Hope I helped :)|`|xglOR1bXaa	flat iron it.    use vitamin e liquid...awsome for hair!!!!    look it up!|`|RCJqaWQYaa	Okay, my advice to you is..     1. DONT  use anything, that will damage your hair, or make it dry as this can cause frizziness. eg. Flat irons, curling irons etc. Avoid them as much as possible! If you must, use a protection product before.    2. The frizziness, could be from dying your hair to much, and has caused chemical damage. So a first, would be to use a deep conditioning treatment (but do not use an oil-based one)     3. Don't wash you hair daily! Leave your hair for 3-4 days between washes. Because, your taking away your hairs natural oils.     4. Cut it regularly. Split ends add to your problem.    5. Damp, hair doesn't help. Keep your hair dry, so always carry an umbrella if you think its going to rain.     6. Use anti-frizz products.    Hope, i helped. (;|`|Czu37rV3aa	Gardiner Frutis!     ~ Shampoo and Conditioner  ~Hair Spray (to keep your hairstyle in place... use ultra hold strength!)    It prevents frizziness and even puffiness up to 80% even in humidity! Good Luck.|`|6RKbOBjYaa	use herbal essences and conditioner it helps because the conditioner make it smoother. and don't straighten your hair much otherwise you'll start to see it go thinner and your hair will start fallin out. you can try puttin egg yolk with fresh millk in your hair set it for 5 mins and then wash and then shampoo with herbal essences! hope this helped!|`|266l7JpGaa	I have naturally curly hair as well, and I just got back from the hairdresser and here's what she told me:    To tone down frizz, make sure you wash your hair no more than 4 times a week, and if your hair gets greasy, use just a little bit of baby powder to soak up the oils. Use a satin pillowcase so that your hair doesn't get tangly and weird-looking. Definitely get layers in your hair or else you'll have hair that doesn't lay right.    After washing your hair, towel-dry it and then apply Frizz-Eaze serum, but not a lot, or your hair will look really greasy. Throw your hair over and bend over and blowdry just a bit (blowdrying all the way will make your hair REALLY frizzy) using your fingers so that you get volume at the top and not have a really weird "A" shape (flat on top, curly on bottom. Once your roots are semi-dry, let your hair air-dry and scrunch it once in a while till its completely dry. Part your hair to the side for a glamour look or down the middle like Melina Kanakaredes.     If you want to straighten it, make sure your flat-iron is not too hot or else you can't do anything else to it, like curl for waves, etc. Put it on a semi-high setting and use one small section at a time and make sure you NEVER EVER EVER flat iron wet hair! It damages so badly!!    One cool thing to know: if you want to pull your hair back halfway or have a curly ponytail, do NOT do it before your hair completely dries! If this happens, you'll train the roots of your hair to go flatter and not curly and when you DO want to curl your hair, you'll have the unflattering "A" shape. Good luck and I hope this helped!
Czu37rV3aa	Extensions will typically look extremely fake so I can imagine what you are going through. My advice to you is to wait to grow it out a little then get it layered by a salon or a professional.    Tell this to the hair salon:    I really wanted long hair again so I have been using extensions but I am wondering what you think I should do. Good Luck!|`|aiAyDpkLaa	I have somewhat of the same problem. my hair is SUPER thick, and its at this aawkward stage where it is just past my shoulders and it doesn't quite lay flat....so when I have my extensions in, you can clearly see where my real hair is and where my extensions are...    what I did though to combat the thin-ness is i doubled up the wefts when I sewed the clips on....it helped alot|`|Op37pHd3aa	get your hair layered and thinned out. take your extensions with you and tell your hair stylist the problem. she will either cut your hair to blend with the extensions more or offer you new extensions.

1plOvGpYaa	sounds a little like a blowout to me...  is the fistula still *inside* your ear lobe, or has it started to pull out a bit?  either way, you should definitely downsize for now (don't worry, you can always stretch back up later) and in the mean time do a saline soak every once and a while.  just mix up some sea salt in some warm water and soak the piercing in the solution...  it's very important that you use sea salt though, as regular table salt is too harsh and may contain added chemicals (such as iodine).  i'd say do the soak once every day, and if it starts feeling too dry, back down to every other day.  if it doesn't clear up soon, definitely go to your piercer (or any piercer for that matter, they'll be happy to take a look).|`|FZCi6WXRaa	I think you should consider downsizing that one,you probably did it to fast.

uhwDqSKkaa	I'd say look up malls in your area that have high end stores like Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus etc. (Sorry if you don't have those exact stores in Canada, it's an example). Also, go to their website (www.dolcegabbana.com). You have to change the language to English first (it's in Italian), but you can buy stuff from the site or try the site's store locator. If all else fails, go to google.ca and type in Dolce & Gabbana and buy stuff from neimanmarcus.com (for example). Best of luck!|`|AjFA8qIxaa	OK malls pretty much have the same kind of stores in them whereever you go. You wont find an actual D&G store in a mall. Also if you buy it at a store you will have to pay a lot more than they already cost because they are imported.   I'm from Germany and D&G is huge over here, everyone wears it, from head to toe. If you want it so bad you will need to go online, preferably italian stores ( see if they ship to canada) this way you will get a more real price.|`|ad26630d1398cb93d795e2a001eda28aaa	mapquest|`|ofZXWpgdaa	they are very expensive.|`|4euPzF2Xaa	y not just go online|`|KyUGECbHaa	u might have to go to a very expensive city like ny probably trying to help good luck!!!!|`|ym8jbkogaa	Go to their website, and go to the mall.

qCPnoKy2aa	It's really a personal choice, I know alot of people that do it and it works fine for them. All the things you hear about larger pores, dark hair, more hair when it grows back is all a myth. It's a mtter of preference. It is one of those things though, that once you start doing it, you'll be doing it for awhile, and it will make your arms "stubbly" kind of like anything else when you shave it.    ADD: Most people think the hair gets dark and thicker becuase they start shaving before/during puberty before the hair gets a chance to become dark and thick. It's part of being an adult, it has nothing to do with whether or not you've shaved. Lol.    ADD: It probably would help with softening the hair to put lotion on it, but your only going to get completely smooth arms with shaving at least every other day.|`|Kq2rFuIyaa	shaving will make the hair grow back darker and thicker|`|ZqkPBwrVaa	you could do it, but then the hair would come out thicker and it could feel like stubble on your arms :S|`|8iR6XOD7aa	its not bad. but just like your legs its grows back and gets darker and thicker... so you'll have yo do it more than once.      try taking sissors and just triming it or thinning it out.|`|UAyRiEGwaa	mmmm,  i've tried, but i hve thinner hair on my arms,  so when it grew back, it wasn't noticeable different,  but judging from many other people  who shave their arms that have darker, thicker hair.  just know that once you start, you can't stop  because it grows back thicker and groseer.  also, it levaes you prone to more ingrown hair, which is a pain    good luuck|`|0LibQ8Fyaa	DON'T DO IT! i've heard soo many bad stories about shaving arms...once you start, you can't stop shaving them, because of the stubble. and your arm hair will grow back like your leg hair does.    try bleaching it...or using a depilatory cream.|`|dcJome8raa	Lotion won't help. Everyone has arm hair, some is less noticable than others because of the color. If it's too dark, and look hairy - then you probably want to shave. Once you start, you can't stop, so if it's not too noticable: don't shave your arms.

If you have lighter color skin then the second one would suit you best I think. Peach colored pumps would go great with it.

TOoNHNv9aa	they can do a couple lightening treatments.  it will work. ive had it done twice due to mistakes while coloring..and it turned black. it was only $10-$13.  or, if you can't or don't want to do that .. you can shampoo your hair a lot and the color will fade quickly.    step 1  Try color remover. You can find this at a drugstore or salon. Since the process will most likely give your hair an orange cast, you will then need to dye your hair the color you want. Note that this process plus re-dying your hair will leave your hair fragile and vulnerable, but the results are instant. Your hair will only be able to tolerate this once, so select your color with care. This works best if you have used permanent color.     Step2  Compromise by highlighting chunks of your hair after waiting at least a week. Since the color of the dye is black, this is best done by a professional. Be sure to have the colorist explain what further damage this could do to your hair, and get an assessment of your hair's condition before proceeding. This will work for both permanent and semi-permanent color.     Step3  Use an anti-dandruff shampoo if you've colored your hair less than 24 hours ago. These shampoos have stripping properties that, after three washes, should remove most of the color. Follow with a deep conditioner which will further strip color. This will work best on semi-permanent color.     Step4  Go to a salon that you trust (or has been recommended) if your hair is also permed or chemically straightened. Though it might be expensive, double-processed hair becomes extremely breakable if subjected to more    *Avoid laundry-type bleach at all costs. It will ruin your hair beyond repair.|`|nWSaiYGNaa	I don't know if this will work for you, but I just bleached it and then dyed it a normalish color that I liked and then conditioned the **** out of it. That's really the only thing you can do unless you want to wait for it to grow out or go to a salon.     Otherwise, check to see if there is hair cutting/coloring schools near where you live. Give them a call and tell them your situation; usually you can get them to dye your hair for relatively cheaply.

9HjMkhaCaa	Lice are growing stronger every time we give them treatment, so you are just making them stronger. The only way to get rid of them fully will be to pick through the scalp every night for a little while (about 3 weeks) and there will be less bugs. don't use those products to get rid of them because they don't work. To stop from getting them, tell a teacher of the school and they will most likely organize a check for each student. They will look at each child's scalp and determine if they have head lice, then leave the parents to take care of the situation Don't do something stupid and keep them home from school. I would keep it a secret that they have lice though, or else families might think you are dirty. You will need to wash clothes and bedding, and other washables more often though. Do not sleep with your kids and don't let them sleep in the same bed for a while. They probably shouldn't have sleepovers while they have lice though. and definitely don't let them sleepover at others houses.    happy to help  email me for ANY more information|`|RhiASZefaa	You need to get lice treatment, not shampoo.

The Robbi -maybe it's called the Robbo- Comb I think is good and Maybe the comb isn't working cause  of your hair type.

6879286ebd43f9d2a6690a2120e9e880aa	I refuse to go to a shop where different people work on my hair everytime I walk in.  I go to my local Spa and Salon where I have found someone that I've been going to for the past few years.  Her and I have built a relationship.  I am comfortable with her doing my hair and she knows what she is doing.  If she were to do something with my hair that I didn't like - I'd feel comfortable telling her so.  I TRUST HER!    The important thing is you find someone that you feel comfortable with doing your hair, stay with that person.  Having different people doing your hair all the time isn't necessarily a good thing.  It takes time for a hair dresser to work with your hair and get to know it.      It does depend on where you live as to how much your going to spend - and where you go (shop).  I go to the spa and salon.  For a shampoo, cut, and style - I spend $30 plus tip.  I normally there for an hour or so.  I feel like a queen when I walk out.  If I were to go to a local quick cut shop like I had done when I was younger (I do take my children there) - it is cheaper - IN MY OPINION with my longer hair - the job isn't as well done.  My hair isn't styled when I am done.  They don't take the time to give you any styling technique advice.  I want someone that I trust doing my hair.  Not just a drive by quickie cut here ya go.      Now in saying all this - I am not willing to pay $100 for a hair cut...but you know what is reasonable...you know what is in your budget...afterall its your hair...do you want it to look good or not?|`|CdTe8MO4aa	wow u must live in LA or newyork  cheap to me is like 8 dollars  lol|`|qCPnoKy2aa	Just becuase someone works at a salon that charges a lot more, doesn't mean they know more or are better at cutting/coloring/styling hair than someone who works at a more reasonably priced salon. I think its worth a shot!|`|8tdlP1rOaa	supercuts?|`|RoR3o6iQaa	for simply haircuts trust your local great clips...but for color and styles you can go to hair schools around you where they do it cheaper and they have guides so they dont mess up.|`|9Q8ArnLRaa	Carlton international have a special for cut,color, and style for $80 and they are amazing.    But for just a cut and stlye that should range from $30-40.|`|AA11615154	beauty school|`|dB9fE7gnaa	ask ur mom to do it|`|tHEihTeCaa	depends where u live|`|a955299a310a71175625cded5cea1a76aa	Doesn't that depend on where you live?     Rates of any services depend upon population demand in the area which they are offered.|`|JCJK16MXaa	I get mine cut at a local beauty college. Since they are training they need volunteers to test on...sounds insane haha but you can get a good cut and colour for 20 (gbp).    Always ask for a person in their final year, they have the most experience|`|wdJcfniBaa	There had better be some gold in your hair to be spending 200 bucks to get your hair done... Though I know it's a lot different for women. It depends where you live, you won't get many good answers. But I will say that my grandmother AND me go to cost cutters. They're pretty cheap and i've never had a complaint.|`|5cDVQED5aa	u could go to the local college for studyin hairdresssing they normall are very cheap and they have a professional watching them, they need the experience and u need ur hair done killing two birds with one stone.   when i was at college studying hair i was so greatful for every customer that put their faith in me and i never had one complaint!!!|`|KFyFmi1Iaa	If you go to super cuts (which is actually where I have mine done) and find someone who can understands you then go there. I've had great cuts there, and I'm currently sporting the best haircut I've ever had. No need to spend $100 when you can spend half of that and get something that might even be better

IzRq1yRPaa	Before I answer I'm saying this, if you won't want a piercing in 2 years, you shouldn't get it now.    Piercing anything yourself is risky.  Things aren't sterilized and chance of infection is higher.    However, if you were to do it at home, you couldn't do it with an earring.  The sizes of a belly button ring and a regular earring are different.  Piercings should be done with a hollow needle and nothing else.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	I won't say don't do it because it will get infected. It probably will but I'm saying don't do it because it would look stupid and regular earrings aren't big enough. It will hurt like hell and when you do go get it pierced in two years you'll have a big scar that hurts to get re-peirced over. You don't sound stupid at all, you just sound like you're 14 years old and a bit ignorant on the matter.
