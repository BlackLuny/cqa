That is why some prophecies can have double and even triple reference. You have probably heard the wise ole maxim: “history always repeats itself”. There’s more truth to that than you may know!<br>  <br>  False time ('Satanic Calendar') is the 13:20 ratio of the Tzolkin long count of 5,125 years broken down into 13 baktuns of 144,000 days each. This count only runs from right before the Great Flood til the 'abomination of desolation' (winter solstice 2012). It was given to the bloody Mayan pagans by Pacal Votan. Other parts of the world received it by meduimship, spirit conjuring, and divination like the Chinese I-ching for example.<br>  <br>  True Time is a dispensation of 7777 years that started back in 4762 BC.

The 7777 years can be divided into 7 periods of 1111 years. 1111 whispers out in many ways to all ready for True Time understanding and no it is not a coincidence.

It was observed by the physicist Johannes Kepler.<br>  <br>  The Sun is not at the center of the Ellipse, which means there is a farthest position from the planet called Apehelion, and the shortest position from the planet, Perihelion.  At the Perihelion the planet looks larger.  And Vice Versa at the Apehelion.  The brightness has to do with the reflecting of the Sun's rays (which planets do very well, though not as good as the Moon).  <br>  <br>  The cities are filled with air pollution and many other lights.  The country side is a very good place to see the sky and shooting star since there aren't that many distraction and distortions in the sky.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	Elliptical orbits.

This means we see it as phases.  But it's distance also varies.  Interestingly enough, the closer it is to us, the "larger" it is (in total angular size)...  however, it is a thinner crescent at these times as well, so less of it's surface (atmosphere actually) facing us is illuminated when it is closer.  For the most part, Venus' distance "usually" overcomes the amount of total illumination for it's total brightness.<br>  <br>  Shooting stars:<br>  The luck is purely superstition.  You are more likely to see them in the country vs. the city due to light pollution...  Less city lights illuminating the sky makes it easier to see fainter objects in the sky.  And *most* meteors are fairly faint, although from my suburban home, I can usually see about 2-5 meteors per night on *non* meteor shower nights.  I would likely be able to see that many per half hour from a darker location.

Medical nitrogen provides a source of pneumatic pressure for powering gas-operated medical devices and as a coolant for carbon dioxide surgical lasers.<br>  2)Medicinal nitrous oxide has well-known and well-documented dose-dependent analgesic and mild anesthetic effects with a MACawake of about 60 vol.% and a MACincision of about 110 vol.%. Nitrous oxide is not sufficiently strong to create general anesthesia as a sole agent. The interaction when combined with inhaled or intravenous anesthetics is more or less directly additive. It can also be combined with all clinically used hypnotics, analgesics and anesthetics. Apart from its analgesic/anesthetic properties, medicinal nitrous oxide exhibits only very minor effects on autonomic functions such as respiration and circulation. Spontaneous breathing is relatively better preserved when anesthesia is created by the combination of medicinal nitrous oxide and any of the commonly used inhaled anesthetics when compared with anesthesia induced by the potent inhaled anesthetic alone. The cardiovascular variables are also less affected. <br>  The rapid “wash-in” (uptake) and “wash-out” (fast elimination) of medicinal nitrous oxide is well known. Because of this rapid elimination and well-maintained spontaneous respiration, emergence has been shown to be faster in many studies where a modern inhaled halogenated anesthetic has been combined with medicinal nitrous oxide than when that has been used alone.<br>  Medicinal nitrous oxide is relatively inexpensive and certainly far more so than most other commonly-used anesthetics/analgesics.<br>  Taking its clinical features, rapid on-set of action, minimal cardio-respiratory effects and rapid off-set, emergence into account as well as its low cost, medicinal nitrous oxide is an interesting cost-effective choice in modern anesthesia. Improving spontaneous respiration during surgical laryngeal mask anesthetic procedures (lasting an ever-increasing number of days) shortens emergence and brings early recovery, facilitating a rapid patient turnover in the operating theatre.<br>  A long and highly extensive record of medicinal nitrous oxide in clinical use is also worthy of consideration. The contraindications for patients for whom the use of nitrous oxide could cause side effects are well recognized and easily identified. There is scarcely any other drug in use today that has been used so widely and so safely with such a vast number of patients
pXra2klxaa	Interesting question!<br>  <br>  Factors that make the rolling down of circular objects on an inclined plane to be slow are the "coefficient of roughness" of the object as well its "mass or weight". The lighter and rougher the object, the slower it will roll down. The soother and the heavier is the object is the faster it will roll down.<br>  <br>  Coefficient of roughness will provide friction between the object and the plane that will lessen the speed of rolling down. The lesser the mass will create lesser potential energy for the object to start rolling down.<br>  <br>  Some example of the objects are the cotton ball and ping pong ball.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
c4b40d3f07535b46185ffe5fc8c3613eaa	If you mean do all turbines rotate at the same speed, i.e. do the blades spin at the same speed, then no.  Different sizes and designs mean that invariably some will operate at lower or higher speeds.  <br>  <br>  For large scale generators connected to the national grid, the rotor speed must be geared so the generator is turning 50 times/second to match the frequency of the grid.  The speed of the turbine is automatically controlled by changing the pitch of the blades.<br>  <br>  For small generators such as those the public can use to provide free electricity, these are not connected to the grid, rather they simply charge a collection of batteries.  The battery output is then passed through an inverter to convert it to AC before it is routed to appliances.<br>  For this reason, there is no need to synchronise the rotation of the generator to 50Hz and the blades can rotate at whatever speed the current wind allows.<br>  Under these circumstances, control gear can load the generator with a dummy load to slow the rotation of the blades, should the wind become too strong and risk damaging the turbine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  xx|`|H4gqyAa0aa	The speed of any AC generator is controlled by the frequency of the grid it supplies. If a generator has two poles, it will need to rotate at 3000 revs/ minute in the UK to give a frequency of 50Hz (50 cycles per second)<br>  <br>  If the generator has four poles, it will rotate at 1500 revs/ min and so on. So, if they all have the same number of poles, they will rotate at the same speed.<br>  <br>  There are governors on all generators - all designed to the same parameters - which will prevent over-speeding.<br>  <br>  The grid is massive compared to a single generator and any attempt to increase speed by any generator will only result in an increase in output on that generator.<br>  <br>  Trying to keep this answer simple, hope this helps.|`|oXPDFw4daa	Wind generators rotate at a speed that is controlled by the speed of the wind and the pitch of the rotor blades.<br>  <br>  That's one of the technical challenges with wind generation - its inherently a variable speed technology.<br>  <br>  Most wind generators today are either asynchronous (induction) generators, or special double-fed squirrel-cage machines with variable frequency excitation to compensate for the fact that the rotational speed will vary.

9GMePSopaa	Electrons orbit the nucleus just like planets orbit the sun.<br>  It seems counter-intuitive at first, doesn't it?<br>  The Sun is exerting a HUGE gravitational force on all planets that orbit. So why don't the nearer ones just fall in?<br>  <br>  It's because the motion of orbiting planets satisfies circular motion. In that there the a force pulling it to the centre, thus creating a linear speed perpendicular to the direction of force. The direction of the linear speed (tangential to the circular path) must be changing constantly to satisfy this perpendicular relationship between linear speed and centripetal force.<br>  If you were to sketch this out, keeping those two lines perpendicular, you would find that the more and more you do, you begin to form a circle. (I know that the planets are in elliptical orbits, but the concept is still similar).<br>  This same concept can be applied to electrons orbiting the nucleus of an atom, since it too satisfies circular motion :)<br>  <br>  Electrons are much smaller because they are fundamental particles, meaning that we know no way of breaking them down further (as of yet). Protons, however, are composed of even smaller constituents known as quarks. These quarks are fundamental too. As protons are baryons, they are made from 3 quarks. So in terms of fundamental particles, protons are greater by 3:1.<br>  <br>  What do you mean by electrons existing as pairs?<br>  I'll presume you are talking about within the atomic structure?<br>  This is more chemistry than physics, but yes electrons can be 'paired up' within energy levels of atoms. They do actually repel a little, but the nuclear attraction still keeps them in place. Repulsion within atoms can result in electrons being removed more easily.<br>  <br>  It's good that you think like this though!<br>  I'm always the one sat in my Physics, Maths & Chemistry classes who says "But why?".<br>  I think that the best way to understand something is to know WHY it happens, rather than just knowing that it does. Keep it up ;D|`|278PAUbkaa	Take quantum physics.
OIDejLJXaa	Because the tilt of the Earth's axis means we have the shortest hours of daylight in these months.<br>  <br>  This means we receive direct heat from the sun for a smaller fraction of the day, than we do in the summer months.|`|6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	Mr Sceptic is pretty much correct. The Earth's seasons are not caused by the differences in the distance from the Sun throughout the year (these differences are extremely small). The seasons are the result of the tilt of the Earth's axis. <br>  The Earth's axis is tilted from perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic by 23.45°. This tilting is what gives us the four seasons of the year - spring, summer, autumn (fall) and winter. Since the axis is tilted, different parts of the globe are oriented towards the Sun at different times of the year. <br>  <br>  Summer is warmer than winter (in each hemisphere) because the Sun's rays hit the Earth at a more direct angle during summer than during winter and also because the days are much longer than the nights during the summer. During the winter, the Sun's rays hit the Earth at an extreme angle, and the days are very short. These effects are due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. <br>  <br>  Solstices|`|JhfG5RUaaa	Yup that's a good deal.

RT4OtkDDaa	This is an... interesting question, but it does touch on some important topics nonetheless. Really, it has a lot to do with human psychology. <br>  <br>  First, you have to define 'sexual morality'. Are you saying sexual morality is essentially all-consentual, that is, without rape? I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to get at.<br>  <br>  Problems with this social format would be thus:<br>  - pretty obvious, but not everyone would want to have sex with with just anyone, plain and simple. Its in our biology to select 'the fittest'<br>  -Males have the extreme advantage in this situation, I think this would increase male influence<br>  -This resembles some tribal communities in which women are 'shared', and that seems pretty degrading. Like it or not, i think this system would quickly dissolve into 'woman sharing' due to male dominance<br>  <br>  I dunno, seems pretty strange to me
AA10929714	There are two forces acting on the object once it leaves one's hand, the gravitational force and the drag force.  <br>  <br>  Let the upwards direction be the positive x direction, then:<br>  <br>  F_grav = -M*g, where g is the gravitational acceleration.<br>  <br>  You didn't specify the functional form for the drag force, so I'll assume it is of the form:<br>  <br>  F_drag = -b*v<br>  <br>  where v is the velocity and b is the drag coefficient.  Note that the drag force is always opposed to the direction of motion (given by the sign of the vector quantity, v).<br>  <br>  The total force is then:<br>  <br>  F = M*a = M*dv/dt = -b*v - g<br>  <br>  dv/dt + (b/M)*v = -g<br>  <br>  We'll eventually solve for the position, but let's first solve for the velocity.  This is a first order linear differential equation.  We can solve it using an integrating factor (IF):<br>  <br>  IF = exp(INTEGRAL of {b/M dt}) = exp(b*t/M)<br>  <br>  The solution is then given by:<br>  <br>  v(t) = exp(-b*t/M) * INTEGRAL of {-g * exp(b*t/M) dt}<br>  <br>  v(t) = exp(-b*t/M) * [ -(g*M/b)*exp(b*t/M) + c]<br>  <br>  where c is a constant of integration.<br>  <br>  v(t) = c*exp(-b*t/M) - g*M/b<br>  <br>  When t = 0, v = v0.  Use this to solve for the constant of integration:<br>  <br>  v0 = c - g*M/b<br>  <br>  c = (v0 + g*M/b)<br>  <br>  So the solution for the velocity as a function of time is:<br>  <br>  v(t) = (v0 + g*M/b)*exp(-b*t/M) - g*M/b<br>  <br>  Remember that at the top of the trajectory, v(t_max) = 0, so let's use this to solve for the time at which this occurs:<br>  <br>  0 = (v0 + g*M/b)*exp(-b*t_max/M) - g*M/b<br>  <br>  (g*M/b)/(v0 + g*M/b) = exp(-b*t_max/M)<br>  <br>  (-M/b)*ln[(g*M/b)/(v0 + g*M/b)] = t_max<br>  <br>  (-M/b)*ln[(1/(v0*b/(M*g) + 1)] = t_max<br>  <br>  (M/b)*ln(1 + (b*v0/(M*g))) = t_max<br>  <br>  We'll need this result later.<br>  <br>  Now, the velocity is just the derivative of the position with respect to time, so:<br>  <br>  v(t) = dx(t)/dt = (v0 + g*M/b)*exp(-b*t/M) - g*M/b<br>  <br>  dx = [(v0 + g*M/b)*exp(-b*t/M) - g*M/b] dt<br>  <br>  x - d = (v0 + g*M/b)(-M/b)*exp(-b*t/M) - g*M*t/b<br>  <br>  where d is another constant of integration.<br>  <br>  If x = 0 when t = 0, we have:<br>  <br>  0 - d = (v0 + g*M/b)(-M/b)<br>  <br>  d = (v0*M/b + g*(M^2)/(b^2))<br>  <br>  x(t) = (v0*M/b + g*(M^2)/(b^2)) + (v0 + g*M/b)(-M/b)*exp(-b*t/M) - g*M*t/b<br>  <br>  x(t) = (M*v0/b + g*(M^2)/(b^2))*(1-exp(-b*t/M)) - M*g*t/b<br>  <br>  We know from above that the maximum height occurs at t_max = (M/b)*ln(1 + (b*v0/(M*g))).  Plug this in for t and solve for x_max.  After a bit of tedious algebra, one gets:<br>  <br>  x(max) = M*v0/b - ((M^2)*g/(b^2))*ln(1 + b*v0/(M*g))<br>  <br>  which is the result you are looking for.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Astronomers have found less than 2,000 pulsars, yet there should be about a billion neutron stars in our Milky Way Galaxy. There are two reasons for this shortfall. One is age: most neutron stars are billions of years old, which means they have plenty of time to cool and spin down. Without much available energy to power emissions at various wavelengths, they have faded to near invisibility. But even many young pulsars are invisible to us with radio telescopes because of their narrow lighthouse beams. "Because pulsar beams are much broader in gamma rays, GLAST will allow us to detect some of the youngest, most energetic pulsars in our galaxy," says GLAST Interdisciplinary Scientist Stephen Thorsett of the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Getting a much more complete sample of the Milky Way's population of neutron stars is one of the most important ways that GLAST will advance our understanding of the life cycle of stars."|`|E0U2yII3aa	Calvera in Ursa Minor is the nearest neutron star.

Also, a neutron star develops from a star between 10-20 solar masses when it turned supernova. Any higher and you will develop a black hole. The first confirmation that they are created from the death of massive stars is the one in the center of the Crab Nebula which happened inside the galaxy.

A wave function or wave function is a mathematical tool used in quantum mechanics to describe any physical system. It is a function from a space that maps the possible states of the system into the complex numbers. The laws of quantum mechanics (i.e. the Schr?dinger equation) describe how the wave function evolves over time. The values of the wave function are probability amplitudes — complex numbers — the squares of the absolute values of which give the probability distribution that the system will be in any of the possible states. ...'.<br>  <br>  However, when an observer makes a measurement of a value within a quantum system he or she must 'collapse' the wave function and, thus, become part of the quantum system.<br>  <br>  The accepted philosophy of quantum mechanics is found within the Copenhagen interpretation. Wikipedia adds, '... The Copenhagen interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics. A key feature of quantum mechanics is that the state of every particle is described by a wave function, which is a mathematical representation used to calculate the probability for it to be found in a location, or state of motion. In effect, the act of measurement causes the calculated set of probabilities to "collapse" to the value defined by the measurement.

If a particle is detected, a poisonous gas will be released and the cat killed. Schr?dinger set this up as what he called a "ridiculous case" in which "The wave-function [sic] of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts." He resisted an interpretation "so naively accepting as valid a 'blurred model' for representing reality."

The filter can be an electronic type or the more common woven glass fiber style which are usually removed when dirty. The cooling element would have an associated air conditioning refrigeration unit in a separate module commonly called the condensing unit. The heating can be electric resistance elements, gas-fired elements, hot water or part of a heat pump style air conditioning system.<br>  There is no single standard commercial nor industrial size. There are many various sizes of "AHUs", large and small as manufactured , which sizes are determined by the volumes of air to be handled.<br>  Another reference to the www.Jim Trade.com  site regarding air handling units (ahu) was actually found to be linked to the reference noted below as Pace Airzone.

JYYnm9uoaa	It is a known fact working out in the evening can actually be an effective way to boost recovery. Simply put, after your workout take your post-workout Whey protein then turn in within an hour.  As long as you can establish 4 good hours of R.E.M. sleep your body will synthesize and and maximize your workout. Because you go to sleep soon after your workout, your body goes directly into "rest", which is the ultimate expedience factor in recovery.  The body can only digest between 30 to 35 grams of protein per sitting, so make sure that you don't consume more than that after your workout...hence it will save you money too.  Try to change your workout schedule weekly, example: one week do two days on, one off, then back two days. The next week do every other day.  Don't buy into the notion of having "light" days when you lift weights. The whole concept of body building is predicated on making positive gains weekly. You can accomplish this in small increments, or larger depending on your goals and abilities.  Try to consume even small amounts of protein every two hours instead of having three large meals. This keeps your body from absorbing amino-acids directly from your muscles when it lacks sufficiency. Lastly, prior to going to bed you should consume a few tablespoons of Peanut Butter, some lowfat Cottage cheese, or Cassein-rich Milk which burns slowly throughout the night as you sleep. Remember, your body is essentially fasting while you sleep. Good Luck, hope this helps you.  -)  Tony|`|B6EpHU1Waa	Stem cells? <br>  <br>  Eat plenty of protein and get lots of rest and try simple exercises to build your muscle strength back up. <br>  If you don't see any results see a doctor and look into a rehabilitation clinic.

ycbkzprjaa	Just as energy must be conserved, so must angular momentum. Example: the body of our sun rotates at a rate of one turn per 25 days. This represents angular momentum. If the mass of that body shrunk, then the spin rate would go up. Shrink it to the size of earth, the spin would be horrendous. This assumes that the sun keeps most of its original mass. Again, angular momentum must be conserved. Pulsars that were once giant stars, now have a much much smaller diameter and only slightly less mass it had during its life, so, its spin must increase.

ayMYfxcfaa	Another possible method (it seems longer, but read through it first):<br>  <br>  Recall that the point-slope form of a line is (y - y1) = m(x - x1) where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.<br>  <br>  The minimum distance from a point to a line is given in the direction perpendicular to the slope of that line.  We will find two points, each a distance of 5 from the point (2, 0), in a direction perpendicular to a line with slope (3/4).  Those two points will lead us to the values of b that we seek.<br>  <br>  Perpendicular slope is the opposite reciprocal.  So, the slope perpendicular to a line with slope (3/4) is (-4/3).<br>  <br>  Starting at point (2, 0), from our slope (-4/3) we will change 4 in the negative y direction and change 3 in the positive x direction.  This leads us to<br>  <br>  ( 2 + 3 , 0 - 4 ) = (5, -4)<br>  <br>  for one of the points.  We know that the distance between points (2, 0) and (5, -4) is five because the segment between the points and the x and y components of that segment form a 3-4-5 right triangle.<br>  <br>  Thus, in point slope form our first line is<br>  <br>  (y + 4) = (3/4)(x - 5) .<br>  <br>  Using algebra to rearrange we have<br>  <br>  y + 16/4 = (3/4)x - (15/4)<br>  y = (3/4)x - (15/4) - (16/4)<br>  y = (3/4)x - 31/4<br>  <br>  and -31/4 is one value of b.<br>  <br>  For the other value of b, we return to the point (2, 0) and from our slope (-4/3) we will change 4 in the positive y direction and change 3 in the negative x direction.  This leads us to<br>  <br>  ( 2 - 3 , 0 + 4 ) = (-1, 4) .<br>  <br>  We know that the distance between points (2, 0) and (-1, 4) is five because the segment between the points and the x and y components of that segment form a 3-4-5 right triangle.<br>  <br>  Thus, our second line is<br>  <br>  (y - 4) = (3/4)(x + 1)<br>  y - 16/4 = (3/4)x + (3/4)<br>  y = (3/4)x + (3/4) + (16/4)<br>  y = (3/4)x + 19/4<br>  <br>  and 19/4 is the other value of b.|`|zY21KHesaa	(3/4)x-y+b=0---------  (1) [took y on the other side]<br>  Now formula for distance of a pt. from a line is---------<br>  <br>  d = |a*m+b*n+c| / sq-rt(a^2+b^2)<br>  <br>  here<br>  m=2 n=0 from the pt.(2,0). and d=5<br>  comparing (1) with a*x+b*y+c=0 we get-- a=3/4 b=-1 and c=b.<br>  <br>  5 = |3/4*2+-1*0+b| / sq-rt( 9/16 + 1)<br>  5*sq-rt(25/16) = |3/2+b|<br>  <br>  25/4= 3/2 + b<br>  b=19/4<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  25/4 = -(3/2+b)<br>  31/4 = -b<br>  b=-31/4<br>  <br>  Thus b=19/4 or b= -31/4<br>  <br>  If u understand it give best ans >_<

When the sperm and egg unite in fertilization, they create a single cell, or zygote, with 46 chromosomes. When cell division occurs (called mitosis), the 46 chromosomes are duplicated.

The Soviets and the Americans are still the only countries to have put boots on the Moon.  <br>  <br>  Why haven't we gone since?  Well, because it's really really hard!  And expensive!  And of dubious scientific value!  But the Chinese should be able to put a taikonaut on the moon by 2020, and the Americans hope to be back by 2030.  A sustained lunar presence is seen as an important step in putting humans on Mars.

A good book to start with is Susan Miller Cavitch's "The SoapMakers Companion." When handling lye, please use gloves and goggles and do not breathe in the fumes.<br>  <br>  General Instructions:<br>  <br>  1. Suit up in safety goggles, gloves and long sleeves.<br>  <br>  2. Add the lye to the water. Stir well taking precautions to not breathe in the fumes. Set the mixture to the side and allow it to cool to approximately 110F. You can put the lye water mixture outside if you are not in a well ventilated area.<br>  <br>  3. Add all your oils together and melt. Allow them to cool to approximately 110F, or within 5 degrees of the lye water.<br>  <br>  4. Add the lye water mixture to the melted oils, carefully. Stir vigorously until trace occurs. Trace looks like a thin pudding. A stick blender will help speed trace along. If you are stirring by hand, these recipes may take up to an hour to trace.<br>  <br>  5. Pour your traced soap mixture into your molds. Pop out after 3 to 5 days and allow to sit for a full 4 to 6 weeks to cure and finish the saponification process.

De4vgWXPaa	Going back about 200 million years, an animal called /Morganucodon/ appears to be at least an approximation of the ancestor of all subsequent mammals.  That makes it close to being an ancient ancestor of hippos as well as Skippy the Bush Kangaroo and the platypus.<br>  <br>  You might also cite 125 million year old /Eomaia/, the earliest known eutherian.  Eutheria is a grouping including placental mammals and their most immediate relatives.  'Dawn mother' (as the name means) is an approximation of the ancestor of all placentals.<br>  <br>  Hippos are in a family called Hippoptamidae, and the oldest known representatives date from the Middle Miocene (approx. 15 million years).  Among the earliest is a critter named /Trilobophorus/.<br>  <br>  The living hippos have the difficult to remember scientific name of /Hippopotamus/.  Remains are first met during the Upper Pliocene; roughly 2 million years ago.  The big hippo and its pygmy sister are different species in the same genus.<br>  <br>  There's a difficulty with seeking ancestors.  They almost always come supplied with baffling scientific names.  Another difficulty with hippos is that, among extant mammals, their closest relatives happen to be whales.

y0MnsQRNaa	First off no-one has actually seen an individual atom fission, but the theory of how it works has passed every test physicists can think up. Your question, as I understand it may have more to do with time. When the neutron is absorbed by the U235 atom it is absorbed into the nucleus and becomes an atom of U236, this unstable atom undergoes fission, at the exact moment it fissions there are nuclei, Neutrons, Gamma, Beta (Electrons & Positrons) not complete atoms, very soon after (nanoseconds) the nuclei capture some electrons and become atoms again, nature wants to form complete atoms. The reactions which concern the nuclear physicists occur in the nucleus so that is usually the only part mentioned.<br>  <br>  Uranium is the principle element used in nuclear reactors and in certain types of atomic bombs. The specific isotope used is 235U. When a stray neutron strikes a 235U nucleus, it is at first absorbed into it. This creates 236U. 236U is unstable and this causes the atom to fission. The fissioning of 236U can produce over twenty different products. However, the products' masses always add up to 236. The following two equations are examples of the different products that can be produced when 235U fissions: <br>  <br>  <br>  235U + 1 neutron  2 neutrons + 92Kr + 142Ba + ENERGY <br>  235U + 1 neutron  2 neutrons + 92Sr + 140Xe + ENERGY|`|x5Wet11Naa	It strikes the nuclei.  When this happens, the atom splits into two and creates more neutrons.  The amount of neutrons in the atom is high causing it to be unstable.  This instability causes the neutrons to run into each other destabilizing it and letting energy in the form of kinetic energy and electromagnetic radiation to occur from the photons that are formed.  the nuclei becomes lighter and eventually becomes uranium 236.  This can be explained in full in the link below.|`|YhIFVEfkaa	it strikes nuclei<br>  it splits into 2 diff nuclei|`|kPG2g4iSaa	A neutron must actually become part of the U-235 nucleus - if only for a *very* short period time - before that nucleus will split. When the nucleus splits, the electrons that surrounded the nucleus temporarily have no place to "orbit". Within a *very* short period of time, all those orphan electrons will find the "halves" of the U-235 nucleus and begin orbiting them.|`|CTN8bnVgaa	An atom is mostly empty space, like the solar system.  When a neutron strikes the nucleus of an atom, it splits apart into neutrons, protons and energy.  The energy is what gives us atomic power.
De4vgWXPaa	Your keyboard is muddling words up a bit.<br>  <br>  'Endothermic' doesn't refer to 'cold'.  It means something akin to 'internally heated' and mammals and birds are endotherms.  Reptiles are ectothermic.<br>  <br>  <<But if they draw energy, how do they generate heat from their body?>><br>  <br>  Usually, they don't, but some have developed methods to some extent.  Some can generate some heat by movement; a kind of equivalent to shivering.  Nevertheless, they're still ectotherms rather than endotherms.|`|6ugR4qNsaa	Yes it is true. A reptiles blood is as cold...or hot as it's surrounding.<br>  So just because it is call cold-blooded does not mean its blood is always cold, its just means it cant produce its own body heat.
rcPnnfmmaa	No, they're always exothermic. They're just more efficient and produce negligible body heat. Some produce more than others; a great white shark is always about ten degrees warmer than the water it's in.<br>  <br>  Humans and birds waste vast quantities of energy to keep our body temperature high.  A crocodile can go months without eating because it's not wasting energy this way.<br>  <br>  Why keep the thermostat set high all the time? Enzymes work faster at high temperatures and so everything, including the metabolism, just works faster. Their metabolism smolders. Ours is on fire; it burns more fuel just keeping itself going but if you want a lot of heat fast a bonfire is good. A croc is a poor marathon runner because it just doesn't have enough energy available for more than a short sprint. Cold-blooded animals would also have a hard time generating enough power to run a human-like brain.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Cold-blooded animals have no refrigeration nor would they want it. Many of them will sit in the sun for hours on end to try to get as warm as possible.|`|VzsEEhRhaa	Yes, that's why the come up to get warmed up by the sun or a heat lamp, if they don't do that then they'll die because there body will slow down|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	No.  They are exothermic in that they burn food for energy.  It means that the body temperature will approximate the ambient temperature, averaging just a little higher due to the metabolic energy.
AA11612672	Time paradox is the phenomenon that would be created if you were to go back in time and change something that would prevent you from going back in time. It really is as simple as that. <br>  Anachronistic would be the 21st century coin that would exist before it was minted. In theory, the coin wouldn't exist before it existed which is the basis for why time travel into the past is not possible. The paradox would be that the minerals for the coin (and human bodies as well as the elements of the time machine) could not exist twice in the same timeline. Basically traveling backward in time would require adding matter (and energy) to the past. <br>  <br>  It's not possible because new matter cannot be created. All the matter and energy that ever existed and will exist is already in existance.
sGoEj6qsaa	The basic answer is NO. Identical -- or monozygotic -- twins form when a single fertilized egg splits in two after conception. Because they form from a single zygote, the two individuals will have the same genetic makeup. Their DNA is virtually indistinguishable. <br>  <br>  However, fingerprints are not an entirely genetic characteristic. Scientists love to use this topic as an example of the old "nature vs. nurture" debate. Fingerprinting, along with other physical characteristics, is an example of a phenotype -- meaning that it is determined by the interaction of an indivdual's genes and the developmental environment in the uterus. <br>  <br>  The ultimate shape of fingerprints are believed to be influenced by environmental factors during pregnancy, like nutrition, blood pressure, position in the womb and the growth rate of the fingers at the end of the first trimester. Thus, you will find similar patterns of whorls and ridges in the fingerprints of identical twins. But there will also be differences -- just as there are differences between the fingers on any individual's hands.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Nope, fingerprints aren't decided by neat inheritance patterns either. They appear to be truly random.<br>  <br>  It is *possible* that two people could have identical fingerprints. There are only so many possible configurations and we have seven billion or so people.

HCF0ate1aa	This is a really good question. Because astronomers talk about the expanding universe, so the first thing you would think is...if the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into?? The problem is it's not, as far as we know, expanding into anything. If the universe is expanding, so is space itself. There doesn't have to be more space to expand into. But, unfortunately, we can't really answer this question with any direct observation, because when we look into outer space, we are also waiting for the light to reach us. That means the light from stars that are light years away has been traveling across space for years. If the universe formed from a big bang at some specific time in the past (say ~15 billion years ago) then looking farther than 15 billion light years away is not possible because the light hasn't had enough time to get here. The furthest out we can see is also the furthest back we can see. So, you see, it leaves a lot to the imagination. Which is proabably a good thing. It's important that there's still mysteries in the universe that we can't answer.|`|TfwYPeV3aa	To put it simply, space is infinite. You can travel as long as you like in any direction, you'll still have infinite amount of space around you.<br>  <br>  For a while we were picturing strange shapes of the universe that were curved and definite (look up a Picard's Horn for an example), but a fairly recent study showed space is flat, confirming the infinite universe theory.|`|f5080642a85b57a445d9e4d43d1f865aaa	"there has to be something else past there, right?"<br>  Why do you think so?<br>  Our daily life and experiences tell us, that there is always something behind everything, but when we dig deep into matter or trying to apprehend other limits, our measured observations tell us, that we cannot rely on our private experiences.<br>  As we realise now, is that we would not reach any end, because an end would mean a border to something else (what our private experiences would expect). That would be the same "something" as what would have been there "before the big bang". But because both space and time have only started to be defined by the big bang, it is not possible to talk about "before" the big bang, because there was no "before", which is because time was not even defined then. We will never reach any border, because there is no "outside" defined: We can only stay "inside", wherever that is.<br>  It is like with quantum processes, which not even experts understand the true nature of it, only the mathematics describing it. It is beyond our common life experiences.|`|gC98RlU3aa	it's literally never ending, no end, no beginning to something else. when we get to Heaven, i'll see u there if you're Saved, we'll be able to figure out the answer to that question|`|EMVT2xjEaa	We don't know<br>  We cannot see past the Cosmic Microwave Background<br>  <br>  It could be other Universe, or an infinitly expanding Universe<br>  <br>  It also matters on the shape of the Universe. It could have positive curvature [a ball], negative curvature [parabola (hard to visualize)], or zero curvature [flat, infinite in all directions]|`|BsV2TQAvaa	What helped me alot was understanding that the term "universe" is a little different that solar system or galaxy or planet. Those are all very specific things with specific definitions. But "Universe" is different because it simply means everything there is.   Our universe is shaped by the limits of our telescopes and our ability to see and percieve. As soon as we learn more and see farther, our universe has expanded. As far as we can see from here, there's no end of it in site yet.  But if you did ever come to the end of it, and look over the side, anything you saw would become just another part of our universe!
wrbkPV0Vaa	Basically, proportions are equalities with fractions. If 1 mi. = 1.6 km, then 1mi./1.6km = 1. <br>  <br>  You want to know how many miles are in 112.6 km, that is X mi. = 112.6km. This is your equation.<br>  <br>  Since you already know that 1mi./1.6km = 1, you can multiply the equation by this fraction, and it won't change anything (any number times one is equal to itself, right?). So, X mi. = 112.6km * (1mi/1.6km). Really, all you're doing is dividing 112.6 by 1.6, which is 70.375.<br>  <br>  For your second question, you know that there are 9 people total on court. If there are 2 women, that leaves 7 men. The ratio of women to men is 2 to 7 (or 2/7).<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!|`|5HTylrjGaa	Oh come on you didn't even try!<br>  <br>  1 mile / 1.6 km = x miles / 112.6 km. Now multiply them criss cross so that you have km and miles on each side. That's how you do ratio proportions:<br>  <br>  1 mile * 112.6 km = 1.6 km * x miles<br>  <br>  I'll let you plug that into a calculator and figure out the answer. All you have to do is divide 112.6 by 1.6...<br>  <br>  1 + 8 = 9 positions on the Supreme Court. 2 are women. So 7 have to be men, since you can either be a man or a woman but not both or neither. So your ratio is 2/7. Again, plug it into your calc.

gvtjyrsBaa	STATISTICS<br>  <br>  Likely, the statistics you'll be learning will be pretty basic. Given a set of numbers, you'll need to be able to determine the mean, median, mode, and range. <br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  For instance, given the set {5, 7, 4, 12, 32, 6}<br>  <br>  The "mean" is the average value. You're probably already familiar with this: There are 6 numbers, and their total is: <br>  <br>  5 + 7 + 4 + 12 + 32 + 6 = 66. <br>  <br>  So the mean = 66 / 6 = 11. <br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  The "median" is the middle value. Arrange the numbers in ascending order: <br>  <br>  {4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 32}<br>  <br>  The values in the middle are 6 and 7 (that is, there are two values less than 6, and two values greater than 7). So, the median is the mean of these two values: <br>  <br>  (6 + 7) / 2 = 6.5<br>  <br>  Note that, if there is an odd number of values in your set, then there is just one middle number, and that is the median. For instance, if our set is: <br>  <br>  {5, 6, 7, 12, 32}<br>  <br>  Then, the median = 7, since there are two numbers less than 7, and two numbers greater than 7. <br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  The "mode" is the number that is repeated more often than any other number. In our example {5, 7, 4, 12, 32, 6}, there is no mode, since no number is repeated. <br>  <br>  Consider the set {4, 4, 2, 7, 2, 4}<br>  <br>  The mode of this set is 4, since it is repeated more often than any other number.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  The range is the difference between the largest and smallest value in the set. In our original example {5, 7, 4, 12, 32, 6}, <br>  <br>  The largest number is 32, and the smallest number is 4. <br>  <br>  Therefore, the range is 32 - 4 = 28. <br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  That's probably all you'll need to know about statistics, although if it's an advanced class, you might want to take a look at the "standard deviation" as well.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  TRIGONOMETRY<br>  <br>  Your best friend in life will be the Pythagorean Theorem. It states that, for any right triangle with side lengths a, b and c, where c is the hypotenuse (or longest side), <br>  <br>  a2 + b2 = c2<br>  <br>  Simple, beautiful, elegant. You'll use this A LOT. <br>  <br>  Then, you'll study the basic trig functions: sine, cosine and tangent. <br>  <br>  Remember SOHCAHTOA ("Some old hippie caught another hippie tripping on acid") which will allow you to remember this: <br>  <br>  sin = opp/hyp<br>  cos = adj/hyp<br>  tan = opp/adj<br>  <br>  You'll also learn useful things like how to find the height of a tree by measuring the length of its shadow, how far away from a 10-foot wall a prisoner must be to escape using an 18-foot ladder, and the distance between a ship and a lighthouse.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  CIRCLES<br>  <br>  After the teacher has subjected you to so many exercises that you'll wonder why the whole thing ever had to happen, he will introduce you to a beautiful and wonderful concept: The Unit Circle. <br>  <br>  This is a circle of radius r = 1, whose center lies on a Cartesian plane at the (x, y) coordinates (0, 0). Simple, beautiful, elegant. <br>  <br>  From this, you'll see how all these sines, cosines and tangents are derived from the unit circle, and trigonometry will suddenly all come together and make perfect sense to you. DON'T MISS THIS PART OF THE CLASS! It is mind-blowing. <br>  <br>  You will also learn different ways of expressing angles. Instead of degrees (of which 360 make up a circle), you'll start to use radians (of which there are 2π in a circle. You remember that weird number π (pi), don't you?) At first, this will seem confusing, and then you'll notice that it is so convenient that you'll never want to go back to degrees. <br>  <br>  You'll learn the equation of a circle, which will serve as your introduction to analytic geometry. You'll learn about If there's time, you might study polar coordinates. At the very least, you should play around with parametric equations (basically functions in two variables) which lead to Lissajous figures (which are really cool)!<br>  <br>  It's a great class, just keep showing up and do the homework; you'll find it's very rewarding.|`|wrbkPV0Vaa	Well... I never took a statistics course, so I really can't help you there. But I've taken trigonometry, and you'll learn about the trigonometric functions (sines, cosines, tangents, etc.), the unit circle, you'll probably go over triangles, properties of the trigonometric functions and other trigonometric properties. You'll most likely learn about radians and how they relate to degrees, and you'll probably spend some time on trigonometric functions (how to manipulate them and graphing them).<br>  <br>  As for circles, you'll learn the basic equation for a circle, graphing circles, and how to manipulate the size and position of a circle through it's function.|`|0zpqA544aa	I don't remember doing sadistics nor trigonometry in geometry.

AA10929714	By inspection, dy/dt = 0 when y = 0 or when y = 6.  These values of y are called the "equilibrium points" of this differential equation.  If y takes on one of these values, then unless y is perturbed in some way, y remains at that value because dy/dt = 0.<br>  <br>  The behavior of the system if it is perturbed from 0 is different from the behavior when y = 6.  When y = 0, if we increase y slightly then dy/dt > 0, and y will increase over time.  The equilibrium point at y = 0 is called an "unstable" equibrium point.<br>  <br>  When y = 6, if we decrease y by a small amount then dy/dt > 0 and y will increase over time until it reaches a value of 6, then it will stay there.  On the other hand, if we make y larger than 6, then dy/dt < 0, and y will decrease with time until it reaches a value of 6 again.  That means that for any value of y > 0, the system will evolve over time to the equilibrium value of y = 6.  In terms of the logistic equation, this is the "limiting value", or "carrying capacity".<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  Euler's method is the simplest method for numerically solving a differential equation (see source). If dy/dt = f(y,t), then we approximate the value of y at some time in the future, based on a linear extrapolation:<br>  <br>  y(t+ Δt) = y(t) + Δt*f(y(t),t))<br>  <br>  Here, f(y,t) = (y/8)*(6-y), and this function only depends on y. (There is no explicit dependence on t.  This type of differential equation is called an "autonomous equation".)<br>  <br>  We are told to use two equal timesteps to approximate the value of y at t = 1.  That means that Δt = 0.5.  We are told that y(0) = 0, so:<br>  <br>  y(0 + 0.5) = 8 + 0.5*[(8/8)*(6-8)] = 8 - 1 = 7<br>  <br>  Now use this value of y(0.5) to calculate the value of y(1):<br>  <br>  y(1) = y(0.5 + 0.5) = 7 + 0.5*[(7/8)*(6-7)] = 7 - 7/16 = 6.563<br>  <br>  --------<br>  <br>  The range of y for t >= 0 for the case that y(0) = 8 is 6 <= y(t) <=8.  As discussed above, all initial values of y > 6 cause the system to evolve to a value of y = 6 as time increases.

HCF0ate1aa	The first thing to think about is why part of the moon is lit. The part that is lit is the part that is facing the sun. So when the moon looks like a crescent, most of the lit side is facing away from us. This means that the moon is pretty close to being right between Earth and Sun. It also means that when you look at the crescent moon, the crescent will be on the side that's closer to the Sun's location in the sky. So when the crescent was up, the Sun had to be higher in the sky than the moon. And when the crescent was down, the Sun had to be lower in the sky, or it had already set and was below the horizon. Just imagine that crescent following the Sun across the sky.<br>  The other part of your question is about the angle that you see a crescent. You saw a crescent moon that was on the left or right side of the moon instead of the top or bottom. There's three things that can change the angle that you see: where you are on Earth (latitude), where the moon is in the sky, and the angle of the moon's orbit. If your standing on Earth somewhere in the 48 states, and someone else is further south, say, in Mexico, they'll be standing at a different angle relative the the solar system than you. Think about the Earth as a large sphere, and two people standing on different parts of the sphere; their heads will point in different directions. So they'll see things in space (the moon, constellations) at different angles as well as at different heights above the horizon. In Mexico, the path of the Sun and moon will be more straight up and down because Mexico is further south. The farther north you go, the lower the angle of the Sun's and moon's paths. So again, imagine that crescent moon following the Sun across the sky. If the path it's following is at a lower angle, the crescent will be on one side of the moon. If the path is up at sunrise/moonrise and down at sunset/moonset, then the crescent will seem to rise straight up, on top of the moon, and set straight down, below the moon. The last thing that will change the angle is the moon's orbital plane, which is about 5 degrees "off" from the plane of Earth's orbit. As Earth goes around the Sun, the path of the moon stays pretty much the same, meaning the "low" end of the tipped orbit is on the same side of Earth. But because Earth is going around a circular orbit, the "low" end of the moon's orbit will be away from the sun one half of the year, and toward the sun the other half of the year. This gets a little complicated to imagine, but it will affect the angle you see a crescent moon. So if you look for the crescent moon after sunset about every 29 days, you should see the angle of the crescent slowly rock back and forth.

SvmZlLdaaa	Yes, I went shark-watching off the coast of South Africa a few years ago. I was supposed to go diving in a cage, but the weather was too bad. A storm blew up while we were at sea and the boat broke down! It was like a scene out of 'Jaws' - there we were in this tiny little walnut-shell-sized boat, with massive waves crashing over it (the sea was so rough we were actually being thrown about a foot off the floor with each swell), three or four great whites circling it (we'd been putting chum in the water to attract them), people being violently sea-sick left, right and centre, and one of the crew trying to suck petrol out of one engine to be put into the other.

If you draw a line between (-1,6) and (-1,0), you get a right triangle.  Notice that tan(θ) = 6/1.  So θ = tan^-1(6).

So that means m+n events in total.  Probability is the the number of events in which something can happen (n) divided by the number of all possible events (m+n).  So P(A) = n / (m+n)<br>  <br>  As for solving n/m = P(A) / [1 - P(A)], multiply both sides first by 1 - P(A), then get the P(A) terms by themselves.
fzU2hP4yaa	I think there's a basic misunderstanding here.  A black hole is simply the left over body of a dead large star.  When it dies it throws off a lot of material in a huge explosion (a supernova).  What's left collapses  to a very small object with gravity so strong even light can't lift itself off the surface.  There are thousands of black holes across the universe and many are being born each century.<br>  <br>  The gravity around a black hole is strong enough to do funny things to time - but only if you're really close to it.  There is nothing a black hole can do to throw you back into time, though.  I'm afraid all you can do is move forward at a different speed, even if you were sitting directly on top of one.  <br>  <br>  If a black hole were to appear close enough to us to affect time on Earth we would be quickly killed.

oXPDFw4daa	Presumably, this is a new installation.<br>  <br>  In new installations, you can never take any alarms or protective functions at face value.  The fact that you are getting a 'reverse power' indication may mean that the power is reversed, or it may mean that the reverse power protection function is wired backwards, and your initial attempts at startup are the only first time that this function has been tested.<br>  <br>  Also, when the function says "reverse power", what does that mean?  In this kind of application, there are potentially two undesirable conditions that could be described as 'reverse power'.  One is where the generator is absorbing real power from the system, while the other is where the generator is supplying power to the grid - it all depends on how the system was designed to operate.  You need to understand that design before you can interpret what this alarm means.<br>  <br>  Presumably, the system was furnished by a system integrator - get on the phone and tell them its not working and they need to get someone there forthwith to fix it.|`|BrarMA1Haa	First, call the manufacturer and installer, and ask them for an answer.  If you paid someone to design it, they should be asked as well.<br>  <br>  Second, have someone check out how the protective relaying is wired.  Reverse power may mean that the relaying is detecting power flowing to the generator, not from the generator.  There could be a wiring error in the control system, such as one or more current transformers having its polarity wired in reverse, for example.  But you will need someone who understands those protective systems to diagnose it.<br>  <br>  You could try running the generator off-line (i.e, not connected to any loads) and see if it still has a reverse power trip.<br>  <br>  And finally, you could hire an electrical engineer to take a look.|`|mXB6vy6xaa	When you say the building power is off, do you mean that you have disconnected the AC power coming into the AC breaker box from the Grid?  The systems I have dealt with are usually set up as follows:<br>  Generator-Inverter-AC breaker panel-Home. and where the power comes in from the Grid you will have your Kilowatt per hour meter and then the AC power enters the AC breaker panel.<br>  Your generator has a reverse power relay that in most cases is factory set at 5%. If you are using the generator as a back-up power supply that comes on when the Grid fed power goes out, then you shouldn't have a problem with reverse power, but once the Grid system comes back on then the relay would detect the incoming power and trip the relay.  If you want to test your generator you need to make sure the AC power coming in to the breaker panel is turned off.<br>  Also, most areas require a licensed electrician to hook up any alternative power source that will be hooked up to a grid tied system.  Always be safe, if you are not an expert you may want to have one check how the generator is wired into the breaker panel.  Incorrect wiring can result in overloads, overheating, polarity problems, etc,  An expert may keep you from creating an unsafe situation or damaging your equipment.

The first term is positive, the second term is positive, but the third term is negative - so the function is negative and satisfies the inequality. You get one piece of information: x>1<br>  <br>  What about at -3.01? x+3 < 0, x-1 < 0, x - 5 < 0. Three negatives still makes your function negative, so x < -3 is another piece. <br>  <br>  Now what about 5.01? x+3 > 0, x-1 > 0, x-5 > 0. Three positives, so your function is positive and doesn't satisfy the equation. So x can't be more than 5, it must be x < 5.<br>  <br>  Now you have three pieces. x < -3, x > 1, x < 5. Put them together to get:<br>  x < -3, 1 < x < 5.

P4cvrMxgaa	You certainly can work as a clinical pharmacist without teaching, you just have to do it at a non-teaching hospital.  Usually, any hospital affiliated with a university requires to some extent their pharmacists to teach as well.  For example, if you are a pharmacist at University of Jupiter Hospital, part of your employment may include teacher a few classes at the University of Jupiter School of Pharmacy.  Private hospitals are usually a sure way to avoid teaching.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not every pharmacist that works in a hospital is a clinical pharmacist.  Clinical pharmacists do a variety of things.  They determine dosing of drugs in liver and renal dysfunction, choose the most appropriate drug regimen given an infection or cause, and alert about drug interactions for example.  A disadvantage would be the need to do a residency, which adds a few years onto your schooling.  Staff pharmacists are not always considered clinical pharmacists and usually check the prescriptions that go out to patients.
Ftkr9jqYaa	Because of the risk that antibiotic resistance may be developed.<br>  <br>  Antibiotic resistance is the ability of a microorganism to withstand the effects of antibiotics. It is a specific type of drug resistance. Antibiotic resistance evolves via natural selection acting upon random mutation, but it can also be engineered by applying an evolutionary stress on a population. Once such a gene is generated, bacteria can then transfer the genetic information in a horizontal fashion (between individuals) by plasmid exchange. If a bacterium carries several resistance genes, it is called multiresistant or, informally, a superbug. The term antimicrobial resistance is sometimes used to explicitly encompass organisms other than bacteria.

After that, you should be able to make breathing motions normally, but there will of course be no air to breathe. You will not experience any exploding eyeballs or embolisms like you see in the movies, although you may experience the Bends (this is when your blood boils). You'll also feel the spit on your toungue and sweat on your body boil away. It's described as a fizzy feeling, like drinking soda. Otherwise, you don't feel very much. Until you die of oxygen deprivation, that is.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Instantly freeze.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	You would turn into a big hunk of carbon.|`|AA11863643	You would pass out in about 15 seconds due to a sudden lack of oxygenated blood reaching your brain, and be dead of oxygen deprivation in about 5 minutes or so.  Unless you were fairly close to a sun or other heat source your body heat would then gradually radiate off into space and you would finally freeze solid.  The pressure differential between a breathable atmosphere and open space is not that great so you wouldn't explode, have bodily organs flying out of your mouth, etc.|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	In the low pressure environment, gas exchange in the lungs would continue as normal but would result in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood would reach the brain, and loss of consciousness would result. Death would gradually follow after two minutes of exposure - though the limits are uncertain. If actions are taken quickly, and normal pressure restored within around 90 seconds, the victim may well make a full recovery.<br>  <br>  Humans exposed to vacuum will lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes, but the symptoms are not nearly as graphic as commonly shown in pop culture. Blood and other body fluids do boil when their pressure drops below 6.3 kPa, (47 torr) the vapour pressure of water at body temperature. This condition is called ebullism. The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.<br>  <br>  Rapid evaporative cooling of the skin will create frost, particularly in the mouth, but this is not a significant hazard.<br>  <br>  Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold his breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs. Eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression, soft tissues may bruise and seep blood, and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia. Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called barotrauma. A pressure drop as small as 13 kPa (100 torr), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if occurs suddenly.|`|G2RS8V4Haa	I don't know.BUt if you mean without everything(including oxygen tank)you'll get radiation and you won't breathe and you'll be lifted up because of no gravitational pull.And you'll just keep floating in space dead until a Planet or any object's MAGNETIC Field pulls you in.There's no such thing as falling in space.OH and if ur talking about just with no space suit on(you Only have the oxygen tank)you'll still float up.radiation.and you'll keep floating until an object's magnetics field pulls you in|`|vpmLkI3laa	you will lose your breath.<br>  the suit helps us protect and supplies oxygen in our body because we need it during respiration (breathing).

x647LeB2aa	Chemical reactions and evolution over billions of years.  You'd have to google it for a detailed answer.<br>  <br>  As for is there life elsewhere?  Probably.  If you consider our sun is a star around which 9 planets orbit and how many millions of other stars there are and how many of them with have orbiting planets there is a good chance at least one of these is able to sustain 'life' too.  It would be a bit arrogant to think we are the only ones.<br>  <br>  When this will be proved is anyone's guess though.|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) The origins of life on earth are now well understood & have been writen about in great depth over the past few decades. The basic facts are:- No.1 The universe & solar system came into exsistence approximately 37.5 billion years ago from a single massive event known as the big bang. <br>  <br>  No.2 From the matter that was created after the big bang the planets formed from the heavier materials. The earth was formed slowly but is thought to be 6-7 billion years old (as just a molten spherical object in space i.e. no life).<br>  <br>  No.3 The processes which lead to the correct conditions on earth for life to get started took several more billion years. i.e. the formation of a land mass, formation of oceans, formation of an atmosphere,etc.<br>  <br>  No.4 Evolution of life gets started & Reference to Darwin will explain the rest.<br>  <br>  No.5 HAS LIFE EVOLOVED ELSE WHERE? Answer is this:- Scientists, Astronomers, & Cosmologists have recently after many many years of research calculated that our universe contains x1 TRILLION stars. Therefore if only 1% of those stars have planets orbiting around them and if only 1% of those do have the correct conditions for life to exsist. Then that still leaves x1 Million potential planets for life.<br>  <br>  No.6 How far life might have evolved is another question entirely though. My guess is that if life does exsist else where in the universe it might be quite primitive like our earth was 1 or 2 billion years back. And although humans & life on earth are carbon based we might discover that life can be based on other elements such as silicon or such like (we shouldn't assume all life will be carbon based like us).<br>  <br>  Kind Regards Ivan|`|758cae615235590fa29ef1d7060ba6d7aa	Life did not evolve on earth. It was created.<br>  It is one of the basic scientific principles that we know - that life does not spontaneously arise.<br>  <br>  The hypothesis that life evolved from non-life is called abiogenesis.<br>  <br>  It is curious that the same text books that (correctly) teach that life comes from life, explaining how cells grow and multiply, and will also teach that at some unobserved point in the past all known scientific principles were suspended when abiogenesis occurred!<br>  <br>  Abiogenesis is just a fancy name - perhaps some people believe in it because of it - for something that is known from scientific observation not to be possible.|`|a1VK1L64aa	When you get a diverse source of matter and oscillating influences the soup of material always try to get to a state of rest while in constant flux or motion. With time these elements combine into stable structures that are suited to their environment. Here on earth this can be represented as proteins and amino acids. With time, more complex and larger compounds gradually develop with symbiotic relationships forming amongst these compounds until the first cell finally formed with the power to self replicate. From there an explosion of growth took place and life was established.<br>  <br>  Some like to think that meteors are responsible for the first cells, but they still had to develop somewhere. They may of added to the diversity that is present here, as part of the ongoing universal flux.<br>  <br>  For Darwin, he liked coral. I expect it has had an important part to play in all this.|`|0PEU3sK4aa	There are many creation theories and myths to explain the beginning of life on earth.  Most popular religious one is the 6 days of creation and one day of rest (the events of which are kind of in the same order as the evolution theories).  The current favourite evolution theory is that one of the ice comets that crash-landed on earth during its volcanic era had the right chemical mix to form the amino acids to start life (or actually had the microbes already frozen in it - so we're descended from space travellers).<br>  <br>  There is evidence that water exists in a frozen state on Mars. If there was ever life there; this is where they will find evidence of it.  Maybe they'll bring a microbe back to earth that will multiply and wipe us out.  War of the Worlds irony.|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	That's the million dollar question....no-one really knows. Any answers you get will be theoretical, your guess is as good as theirs.|`|4GyEpzpBaa	Nothing evolves except ideas and theories.Ask yourself " can you take any single creature and trace back its evolution from actual hard evidence?"  Of course there are text book diagrams and artists impressions based on miniscule "evidence" <br>  Charles Darwin spent most of his life proposing Origin of Species and it is imbibed in our culture if not enshrined in scientific establishments.<br>  <br>  In the end he wrote and  admitted there is no such evidence of intermediery species, even today with the extraordinary methods of mining , exploration in land and sea or excavation and  soil analysis , every plant and creature is species specific and distinct; no -half men, half birds, no half bees, no halfway plants.<br>  <br>  Variants and hi brids, cross breeds and environmentally adapted ,of course. But go to any museum and ask for transition fossil examples and they will look agog.Billions of samples of every creture ever known but no intermediary. Extra ordinary !<br>  <br>  If you point to fragmentary clues to any paticular creature what do you find? Overwhelming evidence of easily identifiable creatures complete in the themselves without forbearerers or present day offspring. Certainly extinct species have been discovered which thrived in a global uniformity of climate. But time scales are hopelessly contradictory and you can prove just about anything with the classic examples. Example things in pacific Islands claimed to be 75 million years  old are now known to have occurred only 175 years ago. Comparitively modern miners tools and artifacts fossilised and discovered in recent times.<br>  <br>  As for the solar system nobody has yet found conditions for life on any other planet.|`|cEJwY5byaa	No one really knows the answer to either of those questions.  The beginning of life on earth involved basic chemical replicators increasing in complexity through a broad definition of natural selection, but the details are still being worked on.  You should remember that 'life' is a fuzzy term.  At no point could you have pinned down the exact spot where 'life began'.

Fq5KBQQlaa	No! Look, I am Spanish. It is trrue that parts of Spain are very hot in summer, and... yes some of my friends in the south see rain about once or twice a year. The rain volume in Spain is divided into mainly two areas: A narrow strip in the North where it rains, actually quite a bit (look up Santiago de Compostela in the far North-West, in the celtic regions of Galicia. It is nicknamed the 'pee-hole' of Spain (pardon my expression), it rains ALL the time) and the rest of the country, called the dry area. Well I am from Burgos, 200 Km south from the northern coast, in what is called the 'wetter part of the dry area'. We get very hot summers, the normal temperature is usually in the thirties or forties celsius during the day. But our winters are amongst the coldest in the country, with temperatures usually below zero and easily below -10C at night. There are huge frosts well into spring and huge snowfalls. <br>  <br>  Your friend said this because when I was in school they told us that Spain might become a desert if the global warming didn't slow up. We have always lived with shortages of water in my country, due to lack of rain. But this would happen in years and years abnd years! And it is not even certain it would happen as other experts say that the polar axis of the planet would change and Europe would be the new North Pole. (hmm) <br>  <br>  So. In short. Spain will continue to have very different climate zones (wet and mild in the north, dry and scorching in the south, continental in the centre, and mediterranean in the east) but it is not going to turn into a desert, certainly not in the near future. (We do have to dust extremely often though like three times a week, the Sahara desert is so close we get so many clouds of  dust, especially with southern winds, even as far notrh as I am! - this is something not everyone knows!)  I live in England now and there is less than half the dust, and I only dust once a week (I am lazy he he)|`|fIy0o2Yfaa	No.<br>  Spain is under the Atlantic influence just as the rest of Western Europe, mainly thanks to the Gulf Stream.

2YkEQrmvaa	The X chromosome contains several genes ESSENTIAL for life, not related to sex.  So a person can NOT develop without an X.  All fetuses are female by default, unless the Y (specifically the gene SRY) is activated at the correct time during embryonic development.<br>  <br>  It is possible to get 2 copies of the Y along with the X (XYY), or to get 2 copies of the X and one Y (XXY).  This is called Klinefelter's Syndrome.  It can be very mild-moderate, including a lower IQ, taller than expected height, acne, and possible infertility (a range of severity)<br>  <br>  Whoops...sorry about the typo, it was late ;)|`|CYtMRC4eaa	There are some incorrect answers.  <br>  <br>  Human embryos do not survive without an X chromosome;  they spontaneously abort within  several days.  So, there can be XO (Turner syndrome), but not OY.<br>  <br>  Klinefelter syndrome is XXY, not XYY.  But XYY, which is called simply XYY syndrome, used to be associated with antisocial behavior, but is no longer.  These men have extra testosterone, are generally taller, and suffer from acne more than usual, but are not  sterile the way Klinfelter sufferers normally are.<br>  <br>  True hermaphroditism in humans is a very complex issue and is very rare;  it's not that these people have both or neither sexes.  Usually the case is having one set of sex organs, but that set doesn't work.|`|BBht4bGsaa	The embryo aborts.<br>  <br>  It actually does occur, you just don't see it because it is dead.|`|maUst1Lsaa	Ya im 22 and did real good in biology and you lost me pal.

Kleinfelter is XXY. But the rest of the answer is correct, they are not aggressive. Males with an extra Y chromosome (XYY) do occur and are not particularly noteworthy. However, it was found that they do end up in prison more than normal (XY) males. This could be due to one or two reasons. <br>  1. They may be more aggressive, and so will tend to be in bad situations more often <br>  AND/OR<br>  2. They tended to have slightly lower IQ than normal, so they well just be getting caught more often, or just not think illegal situations through as well as well as a normal male.<br>  <br>  Your question can be answered, as it does occur occasionally. Rare situations occur when two sperm enter the egg at one time, this may cause a situation where the X chromosome is lost, leaving the two Y chromosomes only. The result is death of the egg, shortly after conception. <br>  .|`|NRyHTl1raa	The first poster has it pretty much right, but XYY is NOT Klinefelter's, it's commonly just called XYY Syndrome.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can also get XXY, potentially even XXX. In those cases, the extra X chromosomes shrink and become nonfunctional Barr bodies. It's a really cool system.<br>  <br>  I really like that you're thinking so deeply about this at your age. Keep it up man, props.|`|2irsR8QXaa	Whoa-ho-ho slow down. :) First of all, there will always be an X. You're right. But X or Y chromosomes aren't considered dominant or recessive, nor are there more of one than the other in any given gender. Every cell in a male's body has an X and a Y chromosome within their DNA, and every female has an X and an X. <br>  <br>  So to answer your question, its not possible for there to be a YY pairing, but you can have an additional sex chromosome such as an XYY (called a super-male). This results in a male with increased testosterone which typically translates into taller, hairier guys, with normal intelligence and normal aggression (surprisingly). <br>  <br>  There can also be a super female, with XXX. Which is increased estrogen and the expected effects of that.<br>  <br>  There is also an XXY form which gives you your common 'ole hermaphrodite. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

QKO4f5q0aa	That would be Venus.  Beautiful next to the moon, isn't it?|`|GDoxT1qWaa	the second-closest planet to the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. The planet is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of love. It is the brightest natural object in the night sky, except for the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of ?4.6. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8°. Venus reaches its maximum brightness shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset, for which reason it is often called the Morning Star or the Evening Star.<br>  <br>  Classified as a terrestrial planet, it is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet," because they are similar in size, gravity, and bulk composition. Venus is covered with an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light; this was a subject of great speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the twentieth century. Venus has the densest atmosphere of all the terrestrial planets, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide, as it has no carbon cycle to lock carbon back into rocks and surface features, nor organic life to absorb it in biomass. It has become so hot that the earth-like oceans that the young Venus is believed to have possessed[6] have totally evaporated, leaving a dusty dry desertscape with many slab-like rocks. The best hypothesis is that the evaporated water has dissociated, and with the lack of a planetary magnetic field, the hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind.[7] The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of the Earth.<br>  <br>  Venus's surface has been mapped in detail only in the last 22 years, by Project Magellan. It shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere is taken by some experts to show that there has been some recent volcanism, but it is an enigma as to why no evidence of lava flow accompanies any of the visible caldera. There are a low number of impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, approximately half a billion years old. There is no evidence for plate tectonics, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous, and some suggest that instead Venus loses its internal heat in periodic massive resurfacing events.|`|5zvpth52aa	Venus ^^ heres the link to what the person above me typed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus</a><br>  (Wiki and Google are my heroes?)|`|Nf60Q6UFaa	Yes, Venus is just East of the Moon now.

wtQY6VEwaa	what is your question?|`|UFteXlqwaa	If your question is about if you will be feeling cold, coming out of the pool, still wet, the answer is yes. 30 percent relative humidity is very dry and even if the air temperature is high, the evaporation rate of the water on your skin will be high and - as it evaporates - water takes energy in form of heat. That's why we perspire.<br>  <br>  For example, in fog, where the relative humidity is 100 percent, you won't feel the cooling effect of perspiration or evaporation of the water from the pool.

Energy and Matter are 2 forms of the same thing.  The release of energy results in a decrease in mass)<br>  <br>  2nd Law:  Not all the energy present is available to do work, some energy is dissipated to the environment and cannot be regained.  It is sort of like a loan from a bank.  The total amount of money is constant but the bank charges interest so you get less than the full amount, the bank keeps the rest.  But, between you and the bank, all the money is still there, somewhere.<br>  <br>  3rd Law:  There exists an absolute minimum possible temperature.  Zero degrees Kelvin<br>  <br>  <br>  If you go back to 0th law, think of energy as a tank of water at the top of a hill.  You can allow the water to run down the hill, into a second tank, and turn a waterwheel, doing work.  BUT, once the top tank is empty, you still a tank of water and you have all the water you started with but it cannot be used to turn the waterwheel.|`|wrqy23Ytaa	In your language that sticking of energy is not loss. it is doing some work. that is used for making bonds etc.... <br>  if energy is not available for useful work that does not mean its not there.

GioA9OFgaa	The answer is all of the above, depending on local circumstances...<br>  <br>  Iceland uses thermal energy because they have it readily available.  Hydroelectric will work if you have great rivers, or great tides in your area.  Solar works where there is an abundance of sun, but not if it is overcast 300 days per year.  Wind works best in remote areas (or from the sea) if there is fairly constant wind.  And Nuc works best if you have nothing else.<br>  <br>  The basic answer is whatever works the cheapest for you, in your location.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Erythropoiesis, or red blood cell development, is the process by which red blood cells (erythrocytes) are produced. In human adults, this usually occurs within the bone marrow. In the early fetus, erythropoiesis takes place in the mesodermal cells of the yolk sac. By the third or fourth month, erythropoiesis moves to the spleen and liver. In humans with certain diseases and in some animals, erythropoiesis also occurs outside the bone marrow, within the spleen or liver. This is termed extramedullary erythropoiesis.<br>  <br>  In the process of red blood cell maturation, a cell undergoes a series of differentiations. The following stages 1-7 of development all occur within the bone marrow:<br>  <br>  1. pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell <br>  2. multipotent stem cell <br>  3. unipotent stem cell <br>  4. pronormoblast <br>  5. basophilic normoblast / early normoblast <br>  6. polychromatophilic normoblast / intermediate normoblast <br>  7. orthochromatic normoblast / late normoblast <br>  8. reticulocyte<br>  9. erythrocyte<br>  <br>  The cell is released from the bone marrow after stage 7, so circulating red blood cells are ~1% reticulocytes. After 1-2 days, reticulocytes become "erythrocytes" or mature red blood cells.<br>  <br>  ****************************<br>  Thrombopoesis is the developmental pathway for platelets.  Platelets are produced in bone marrow, by budding off from megakaryocytes.  Megakaryoctes generate thrombocytes, which, in mammals, are anucleated cell fragments called platelets, and play a key role in blood clotting.  Thrombopoesis is stimulated by thrombopoietin (aka. leukemia virus oncogene ligand, megakaryocyte growth and development factor, or THPO), a glycoprotein hormone produced mainly by the liver and the kidney that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow.<br>  <br>  ***************************<br>  Adenocytes are secretory cells of glands, such as the stratum spongiosum or decidua of the uterine endometrium.<br>  <br>  The endometrial lining undergoes cyclic regeneration. Humans and the great apes display the menstrual cycle, whereas most other mammals are subject to an estrous cycle. In both cases, the endometrium initially proliferates under the influence of estrogen. However, once ovulation occurs, in addition to estrogen, the ovary will also start to produce progesterone. This changes the proliferative pattern of the endometrium to a secretory lining. Eventually, the secretory lining provides a hospitable environment for one or more blastocysts.<br>  <br>  If no blastocyst is detected, the progesterone level drops and the endometrial lining is either reabsorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle). In the latter case, the process of shedding involves the breaking down of the lining, the tearing of small connective blood vessels, and the loss of the tissue and blood that had constituted it through the vagina. The entire process occurs over a period of several days. Menstruation may be accompanied by a series of uterine contractions; These help expel the menstrual endometrium.<br>  <br>  In case of implantation, however, the endometrial lining is neither absorbed nor shed. Instead, it remains as decidua. The decidua becomes part of the placenta; it provides support and protection for the gestation.<br>  <br>  If there is inadequate stimulation of the lining, due to lack of hormones, the endometrium remains thin and inactive. In humans, this will result in amenorrhea. After menopause, the lining is often described as being atrophic. In contrast, endometrium that is chronically exposed to estrogens, but not to progesterone, may become hyperplastic.<br>  <br>  In humans, the cycle of building and shedding the endometrial lining lasts an average of 28 days. The endometrium develops at different rates in different mammals. Its formation is sometimes affected by seasons, climate, stress, and other factors.

zFsTSrOcaa	Storms are caused by the sun.  Since the earth isn't perfectly uniform, the sun's radiation heats the earth differently in different places.  If a parcel of air is warmer than its surroundings, it will rise.  More air then has to move in to replace the rising air, creating horizontal winds.  Storms in the middle latitudes generally form in those areas where there are large temperature gradients to enhance the air circulation.  (Tropical storms are also caused by solar heating, but their energy source is the heat content of the ocean rather than a temperature gradient.)|`|sa8dElLZaa	Tropical Storm Formation<br>  Tropical storms generally form in the eastern portion of tropical oceans and track westward. Hurricanes, typhoons, and willy-willies all start out as weak low pressure areas that form over warm tropical waters (e.g., surface water temperature of at least 80 oF). Initially, winds and cloud formations over the warm tropical waters are minimal. Both intensify with time. Formation of tropical storms also requires a significant Coriolis effect to induce proper spin in the wind formation. As the storm begins to organize itself into a coherent pattern, it will experience increased activity and intensity.<br>  <br>  When a storm develops a clearly recognizable pattern, it is referred to as a tropical depression. When wind speeds reach 35 knots (40.3 mph), it is called a tropical storm and is given a name. When wind speed equals or exceeds 74 mph, the storm is called a hurricane. In the western Pacific, a hurricane is referred to as a typhoon. In waters around Australia it is called a cyclone or willy-willy.<br>  <br>  Hurricanes intensify when moving over areas of increased water temperatures, and weaken over colder water surfaces. Upper atmosphere wind shear (different wind direction and speeds at different elevations) will frequently prevent or slow intensification of tropical storms by "spreading out" the storm horizontally and preventing the formation of strong updrafts of warm, humid air. Movement over a land-mass will weaken hurricane winds but will result in large-scale rain that can result in large-scale flooding. When encountering a strong frontal system (such as a polar front) the hurricane will curve and track along the leading edge of the front or become implanted in it.<br>  <br>  Satellite infrared imagery can identify surface water temperatures that will foster tropical storm development.

sa8dElLZaa	Lava is molten rock that spews from an erupting volcano. It is extremely hot, reaching temperatures as high as 1,300 to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (704 to 1093 degrees Celsius). In a volcanic eruption, lava is in liquid form. When it solidifies, it forms igneous rock. However, it can take quite a long time to cool, traveling great distances before becomes solid. <br>  <br>  Many individuals are unaware that lava isn’t always red. It can be bright orange, bright red, dark red, or brownish red, depending on its temperature. At its hottest, above about 1832 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius), it is bright orange, while it is dark red at temperatures between 1472 and 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit (800-1000 degrees Celsius). Lava is dark red at temperatures between 1202and 1472 degrees Fahrenheit (650-800 degrees Celsius), and brownish red at temperatures ranging from 932 to 1202 degrees Fahrenheit(500 to 650 degrees Celsius). In its solid form, lava is black. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-lava.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-lava.htm</a><br>  <br>  Hot magma<br>  <br>  You certainly wouldn’t want to be near this molten rock, since it is extremely high in temperature. Though a few materials melt at temperatures of about 1100 degrees F (593.33 C), most magma under the earth’s crust maintains temperatures between 1292 and 2372 degrees F (700-1300 C). When molten rock erupts or flows onto the earth’s surface, it quickly loses heat energy, though it’s still far hotter than exposure would warrant. <br>  <br>  More here -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-magma.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-magma.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Equipment to measure heat -<br>  Spectrometer is one.<br>  <a href="http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0010/27sizzlingio/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0010...</a>|`|WbVE1cXKaa	the temperature of magma depends very much on the chemistry of the material.  And pressure, but that really doesn't apply to lava, only the parent magma.<br>  <br>  About the coolest you will see a lava is around 600-700°C, and this would be a very viscous, water and silica-rich (granitic) lava.  A more basaltic lava would tend to be on the order of 1000-1200°C.  <br>  <br>  One can measure the temperature directly using a tool called a thermocouple, which is a metal rod that displays a variable electrical conductance as a function of temperature.  The amount of electrical signal (current) that passes the unit is directly proportional to the temperature.    <br>  <br>  One can also get a measure of temperature from the light emission of the lava. The color and intensity of the light are a function of the temperature.
9Wi2eNInaa	If we can't see the diagram in Figure 7.14 it's difficult to make any equations here.Does the wood pendulum completely absorb the bullets impact or not ? If the bullet is absorbed by the wood the energy is converted to heat and there is no speed after impact.   Is the pendulum at rest or moving?  Does the wood only absorb part of the energy? If it doesn't absorb any of the energy and converts nothing to heat  then it would be:<br>   <br>  1/2 mv^2 {1} = 1/2 mv^2 {2}<br>  <br>  1/2 (2.24g) ( 462 m/s)^2 = 1/2 ( 288 g) ( X m/s)^2<br>  Solve for X = 40.745 m/s for ballistic block at impact<br>  <br>  But ballistic block and bullet now travel as one unit,<br>  so ( I think) formula is :<br>  <br>  1/2 (2.24g) ( 462 m/s)^2 = 1/2 ( 288 g+ 2.24g) ( X m/s)^2<br>  X = 40.57 m/s block and bullet combo speed<br>  <br>  <br>  b) Kinetic energy = Potential energy<br>  1/2 mv^2 = mgh<br>   Solve for height (h)<br>  <br>  1/2( 290.24 g)(40.57 m/s)^2 = 290.24g (9.8 m/s^2)*h<br>  <br>  238,856.6 J = 2844.4 * h<br>  <br>  238,856.6/ 2844.4 = 83.97 meters above initial position.<br>  <br>  Now this is only true if the bullet gave up NO ENERGY IN DEFORMATION OR HEAT TRANSFER.

N0UUmjDlaa	I think you are asking if you can replace an incandescent bulb with a LED.<br>  Yes, you can, but the LED will require a dropper resistor in series to limit the current (and voltage) to a useable limit.<br>  Another possible problem is the 28V could be AC, not DC as the LED requires. If AC you would either need to convert the source to DC using a rectifier, or insert a diode in series with the LED (each LED) to rectify it. <br>  You need to find the specs. for the LED you wish to use, and look up the voltage and current rating.<br>  Then using Ohm's Law, you can calculate the ohmic value of resistor you need to drop the 28V to the LED voltage (use a meter to measure the actual voltage on the bulb socket, it won't necessarily be 28V).<br>  R = E/I, where R is the resistor value in ohms; E is the voltage DIFFERENCE between the supply and the LED voltage, in volts; the I is the current suggested for the LED in AMPS.<br>  So if the LED required 20 milliamps @ 3Volts, and you have 28V supply,<br>  R = E/I = 25/.030, which is 833 Ohms.<br>  A quick check for the wattage rating of the resistor,<br>  W = E X I = 25 x .030, which is .75 Watts. So you would use a 1 watt rated resistor of 833 Ohms value.<br>  You may find difficulty finding a suitable place to insert the resistor. It will get a bit warm, but not seriously hot.<br>  If you use a diode to rectify AC, the additional voltage drop across thediode will be about 1.2 Volts. You subtract this from the supply voltage first, then calculate the difference between that figure and the LED voltage required.

There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Trinage of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.|`|b8d332c1c0bc909a21186446e03a5e2caa	Everyone thought the world would end in the year 2000 and it hasn't.

ossCVxPqaa	In order to get good crystals you need to make a saturated solution at a high temperature. Say 90°C. This solution must be allowed to cool down as slowly as possible - in college we used to insulate the container by wrapping it in paper and cloth. Leave it to stand overnight and the next morning you will have good crystals.<br>  <br>  For a start I suggest that you work with 250ml of water in a 500ml beaker. The solubility of sodium acetate at 90°C is 161g per 100g water - so you need to use a little more than this - for 250ml, use 425g of sodium acetate. you can start by adding some to the cold water and dissolving - begin to heat the water. As the salt dissolves. keep adding more until at the high temperature all the salt has dissolved. <br>  BE VERY CAREFUL!!! THE SOLUTION IS VERY HOT AND IF YOU SPILL IT ON YOURSELF YOU CAN GET SERIOUSLY BURNT. IT IS BETTER TO DO THIS UNDER SUPERVISION OF AN ADULT ( I ASSUME THAT YOU ARE YOUNG) . <br>  <br>  As I said, insulate to allow slow cooling Check next day.

So from day to day it moves about 360/27 degrees in its orbit. So from one day to the next it is not in the same place in space. So when you view it from earth the azimuth and altitude at the same time the next day is different.

DO1ebm95aa	You'll have to experiment with different materials that you have available.  If you have a thermometer, you can try different materials around a bottle with hot or cold water and see which one keeps its temperature better.  If you don't have a good thermometer, you can try putting in a measured amount of ice and seeing how long it stays ice--the longer the better.  <br>  <br>  Your factors affecting your thermos's performance are conduction, convection, and radiation.  I disagree with the previous post that a plastic bottle will stop convection and all you need to do is paint it silver to stop radiation.  Radiation loss is only an effect that is evident in vacuum thermoses because they have NOTHING (i.e. a vacuum) between the inner and outer walls.  With nothhing there, you cannot have convection or conduction, so all that is left is radiation--and a silver coating works well.  You will probably not be able to make a vacuum thermos with household items, so you'll be using insulating materials instead.  Most insulating materials have small enclosed air pockets (foam, bubble wrap, etc), because air is a very good insulator, but only when it doesn't move (convect).  When you start wrapping insulating materials around a bottle, most of them are opaque to radiation and so the effect of radiation loss is small--not worth bothering with the silver paint.  A thin layer of plastic, like in a plastic bottle, is a very poor insulator, and a little silver paint is not going to work well--you'll loose a lot of heat really quickly to conduction and convection.<br>  <br>  Use common sense: if the container you put hot or cold water in feels hot or cold to your touch after you fill it, you have not insulated it well.  I think you will agree that a 2 liter bottle filled with hot water will very quickly feel hot to the touch, no matter how much you paint it with silver paint.  But if you start wrapping it with, as you suggested, bubble wrap, then it will no longer feel hot (or cold) to the touch.  That is a sign that your insulation is working.  Do make it opaque--like if you use clear bubble wrap, use something that doesn't let light through, like paper towels layered between the clear layers to reduce radiation losses--it doesn't have to be silver if you don't have silver paint.  But if you use something like fiberglass insulation or styrofoam, you won't have to worry about it.|`|GioA9OFgaa	A thermos is something that will not allow heat to enter or exit the device.<br>  <br>  We have to stop both radiation and convection from the device.<br>  <br>  I assume they will test your device by placing cold water in it, and see how fast the water warms up.  It depends somewhat on what you are protecting, and I would not think they would use liquid helium as a test.<br>  <br>  With water, try this...  Go to the paint store and get the "shinyest" silver paint you get get.  It really needs to be like a mirror,  AND, get some "clear" paint like acrylic with UV protection.  Maybe you can get this from your Dad's paint supply.<br>  <br>  We are going to construct a "thermos" with both radiation and conduction protection, also has good convection protection.<br>  <br>  Take a 3 liter soda bottle, and pour the silver paint inside, let it coat, pour it out, and let it dry.  This is thermal reflective material (reflects thermal radiation back inside the bottle. When it is very dry (2 days, at least), then add the acrylic to the inside of the bottle, swish it around, and pour it out very quickly (do it does not begin to dissolve the silver paint.  Let it dry for 2 days.  At this point you might repeat to build multiple layers, but that is probably not necessary.  The trick here is to apply the different coats of paint rapidly so the new coat does not dissolve the previous coat.<br>  <br>  What we now have is a infrared-reflective coat (silver) covered by a convection coat (that may not be needed - experiment with it).  Now you need to coat the outside of the bottle with first a silver layer, and then an acrylic layer.<br>  <br>  Do not flex the bottle (cracks the paint), but you have something that will protect water better than just the plastic bottle.<br>  <br>  The two things you need to protect against is heat loss from both thermal and convection.  Conduction is almost elimited by the plastic bottle, and that mostly eliminates convection.  All you now need to do is prevent loss by radiation (the silver paint.)|`|2VdZ60DRaa	i would get inselation and wrap it around the thing
KKev7q04aa	I'm not certain if this is of any help, but:<br>  <br>  Usually, these motors have a nameplate that will give the temperature rise, above ambient, for the motor when running at rated load. Usually it's 40 or 50 C above ambient. If the motor is running at this relatively constant temperature, there is probably some physics equation to determine heat radiation at various distances from a heat source at a known temperature differential from ambient.

If you know the distance travelled and the time taken, then you know the average velocity during that time ( Vavg = d / t), but if that average velocity is not the same as the starting velocity, then some definitely acceleration was involved (even if it were the same, the object may have slowed down or speed up and still had the same average velocity).  Not knowing if the acceleration was constant, one can only guess as to what the final velocity might be.  The best guess would be the simplest (this follows the scientific principle of 'parsimony', sometimes referred to as Occam's razor:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor)," rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_raz...</a> and that's probably to assume constant acceleration or an impulse.  Since the impulse is easier to work with (meaning to assume that enough energy is given over a very short time to change the velocity to a new value), I'd choose that one and report a final velocity equal to the average velocity.  Of course, if you have more information that you've neglected to share, then that information would have to be factored into a parsimonious answer.|`|skxhE5owaa	find the average speed, then double it<br>  the average speed being distance/time<br>  :D|`|m2pNTLloaa	distance: Known<br>  Start velocity (Vo) : Known<br>  Time (t): known<br>  Final velocity (Vf): Unknown<br>  Acceleration (a): Unknown<br>  <br>  d = 0.5 * a * t^2 + Vo * t<br>  <br>  Plug in your knowns and solve for "a"<br>  <br>  Vf = a*t + Vo * t<br>  <br>  QED|`|2oc6TDiGaa	0. the final velocity is when it stops

More abstractly and more precisely, it may be taken to ask whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles entail the existence of such a square.<br>  <br>  In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi (π) is a transcendental, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. It had been known for some decades before then that if π were transcendental then the construction would be impossible, but that π is transcendental was not proven until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, on the other hand, is possible in a finite number of steps, as a consequence of the fact that there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to π.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_th...</a>

nTKuRFlKaa	*Please understand the cavitation phenomena.It is quite interesting in fluid mechanics especially with the pump handling <br>  <br>  What is written is absolutely correct.Just not deeply elaborated.<br>  <br>  Cavitation is a  'cancer' of the hydraulic system.<br>  <br>  For that you have to understand NPSH [ Available as well as required].<br>  <br>  It is a available head at the suction of the pump that is above the vapor pressure of the liquid at the prevailing temperature.<br>  <br>  If the vapor are created at the pump suction that is a low pressure region ,around impeller eye portion ,it will go to the high pressure region due to centrifugal action of the pump,that is at the impeller outer periphery ,where the vapor bubbles are collapsed .Since bubbles are having some volume and collapsing result in voids , surrounding liquid will rush tremendously to fill this voids which will result in pressure surges in the range of 10000 PSIg and this will spoil the performance of the pump.<br>  <br>  A fluid vaporizes when its pressure becomes too low, or its temperature too high. All centrifugal pumps have a required head (pressure) at the suction side of the pump to prevent this vaporization. This head requirement is supplied to us by the pump manufacturer and is calculated with the assumption that fresh water at 68 degrees Fahrenheit (Twenty degrees Centigrade) is the fluid being pumped.<br>  <br>  Since there are losses in the piping leading from the source to the suction of the pump, we must determine the head after these losses are calculated. Another way to say this is that a Net Positive Suction Head is Required (N.P.S.H.R.) to prevent the fluid from vaporizing.<br>  <br>  We take the Net Positive Suction Head Available (N.P.S.H.A.) subtract the Vapor Pressure of the product we are pumping, and this number must be equal to or greater than the Net Positive Suction Head Required.<br>  <br>  To cure vaporization problems you must either increase the suction head, lower the fluid temperature, or decrease the N.P.S.H. Required.<br>  <br>  Please go through the source links and digest well.<br>  <br>  -Cavitation means that cavities or bubbles are forming in the liquid that we're pumping. These cavities form at the low pressure or suction side of the pump, causing several things to happen all at once:<br>  <br>      * The cavities or bubbles will collapse when they pass into the higher regions of pressure, causing noise, vibration, and damage to many of the components.<br>      * We experience a loss in capacity.<br>      * The pump can no longer build the same head (pressure)<br>      * The pump's efficiency drops.|`|55dd6baac3e1d46174ac190ca1ae4e38aa	Both answers are correct. The first case is describing how the bubbles are created. That is when the pressure falls below the vapour pressure or the boiling point or saturation pressure. This will normally be at the inlet of the pump impeller where pressure is least.<br>  The second case is what happens at the outer radius of the impeller blade where the pressure is the greatest. The bubble will collapse when the pressure exceeds the vapour pressure of the fluid. This releases immense mechanical energy which the impeller blade must absorb and in the process is pitted and worn out.<br>  So both answers are right but they refer to different stages of the cavitation process ie the start and the destruction of the bubble.|`|9634adc643ad32c66405cde6d71caefeaa	The bubbles are created when the fluid pressure drops below the vapor pressure, and they collapse when the pressure increases above the vapor pressure.|`|HyAFA5Jpaa	The erosive effect occurs where the pressure returns above saturation for the fluid - the collapse of the vapor bubbles is a mechanically energetic event.  A pump which is in the early stages of cavitation sounds like it is pumping gravel, while one in heavy cavitation can actually jump out of its mounts.  (It is time to turn the pump off or leave the area at high speed!)<br>  The formation of bubbles occurs in the low pressure (high velocity) region, but the collapse and 'mechanical energy release' occurs where pressure is increasing...
UduT0agRaa	Benedict's solution, deep-blue alkaline solution used to test for the presence of the aldehyde functional group, -CHO. The substance to be tested is heated with Benedict's solution; formation of a brick-red precipitate indicates presence of the aldehyde group. <br>  <br>  Reducing sugar is oxidized when heated with Benedict's solution, which means the sugar looses electrons. Benedict's solution contains copper sulphate. The copper 2+ ions in copper sulphate gain an electron that the sugar has lost and become copper 1+ ions - this is called reduction. The copper ions immediately react with oxygen to form copper oxide which forms a reddish brown precipitate. The more red the solution looks, the more copper oxide there is, and therefore the more sugar is in the solution.

TIrftbTWaa	The first electric light was made in 1800 by Humphry Davy, an English scientist. He experimented with electricity and invented an electric battery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. This is called an electric arc. <br>  Much later, in 1860, the English physicist Sir Joseph Wilson Swan (1828-1914) was determined to devise a practical, long-lasting electric light. He found that a carbon paper filament worked well, but burned up quickly. In 1878, he demonstrated his new electric lamps in Newcastle, England. <br>  <br>  In 1877, the American Charles Francis Brush manufactured some carbon arcs to light a public square in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. These arcs were used on a few streets, in a few large office buildings, and even some stores. Electric lights were only used by a few people. <br>  <br>  The inventor Thomas Alva Edison (in the USA) experimented with thousands of different filaments to find just the right materials to glow well and be long-lasting. In 1879, Edison discovered that a carbon filament in an oxygen-free bulb glowed but did not burn up for 40 hours. Edison eventually produced a bulb that could glow for over 1500 hours. <br>  <br>  Lewis Howard Latimer (1848-1928) improved the bulb by inventing a carbon filament (patented in 1881); Latimer was a member of Edison's research team, which was called "Edison's Pioneers." In 1882, Latimer developed and patented a method of manufacturing his carbon filaments. <br>  <br>  In 1903, Willis R. Whitney invented a treatment for the filament so that it wouldn't darken the inside of the bulb as it glowed. In 1910, William David Coolidge (1873-1975) invented a tungsten filament which lasted even longer than the older filaments.

Basically, there are two sorts of "blood" that can be given to people - cells and plasma.  <br>  <br>  Plasma can be given to anyone because it does not contain any genetic material.  But "cells" must match between the donor and the recipient because it involves genetic material - we are talking about blood-type, here.<br>  <br>  Plasma restores volume to a victim, but no oxygen carrying abilities.  Red blood cells contribute oxygen-carrying abilities, but the makeup of those cells much be the same type between donor and recipient, else the recipient's white corpuscles (lucosytes) will attack them.<br>  <br>  Sometimes restoring volume is importand, but there other times where restoring oxygen-carrying capacity is importand and that reqauires "typing" of the cells.

34e3618d21c91025c3721e1f5950f4d3aa	The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.<br>  You have probably noticed that the sea is not very blue-looking when the sky is overcast. Water reflects and scatters the light that strikes it; this is shown by the fact that you can see your reflection in puddles. When the sky is brilliant blue, the sea is also, because it reflects the blue of the sky. Blue light is more easily bent, or refracted, than red light; thus, light refracted back from the surface of the sea appears blue. Furthermore, when you are underwater the water around you appears blue because more blue light is scattered back to your eye than red light. Hope that answers the question.|`|2836a4af4b38628807a36102a7632f75aa	i think it is due to dispersion of light.|`|46a2ae0eddb807e105c0604a9fd30525aa	We see the sky as blue cause of  refraction of light in the atmosphere.

The process could take a long time depending on various factors such as the type of glue, amount of water, etc...but it will eventually occur.|`|70150e62ae12f6b890c6ce7b1b8fdb6caa	Depends on the glue. <br>  <br>  White glue depends upon solvent evaporation (water, actually). After it's applied, the water evaporates and the latex left behind forms a flexible bond. Of course, a closed bottle prevents this evaporation.<br>  <br>  Others depend on chemical reactions...using chemicals not present within the bottle. For example, Superglue uses water, and since everything has, at minimum, trace amounts (including moisture in the air) this stuff works on just about everything!

We often refer to India as a Subcontinent because it rests on a large continental plate fragment.  The continents are effectively "floating" on more dense deep sea bed structures.<br>  <br>  Japan is not very large, and it sits in relatively shallow waters of the edge of the asian continent. Even if it were the size of australia, if the underlaying structure was still an extension of asia, I wouldn't regard it as a seperate continent.  There has to be a massive and very deep separation (miles deep below the sea bed) to qualify as a different continent. IMHO.|`|fIy0o2Yfaa	No, continents are just political conventions. For instance, as a landmass on one single tectonic plate surrounded by seas and oceans, Europe and Asia (expect India) would in fact be the continent Eurasia.<br>  <br>  Japan is part of three tectonic plates, with the Pacific one nearby.

FRJoKiA0aa	I can only think of galvanizing, painting and oil coating. Galvanizing is pretty effective and works by coating the ferrous metal with another metal by electrolysis or hot-dipping.The metal coating is the most effective of the three as it will last the longest and gives a complete, even protection. Painting is simply just coating the ferrous metal with a paint which prevents atmospheric oxygen from reacting with the metal. The paint can obviously chip off though so isn't as effective. Oiling is just covering the metal in a layer of oil, which prevents oxygen from reacting with the metal. Think of a bike chain for that. The obvious problem is that the coat of oil needs to be reapplied continuously.|`|0m9NVjpsaa	Apart from the above, there are methods like, carbon coating, cathodic protection.

QKO4f5q0aa	Your question displays a common misconception about the word 'theory' as used in science.  <br>  <br>  In everyday use, 'theory' means 'an educated guess' (or sometimes 'a wild guess').  In science a theory is the end result of the scientific process, and is what happens when you gather supporting evidence for a hypothesis.  It is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, an organized system of accepted knowledge that applies in a variety of circumstances to explain a specific set of phenomena.  Theories can incorporate facts and laws and tested hypotheses.  <br>  <br>  The big bang theory is a well-supported theory, a structural explanatory framework that incorporates the evidence we have at hand into an organized explanation of the beginning of the universe.<br>  <br>  So yes, it is 'proven' (in everyday terms) well beyond any reasonable doubt.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I should note that in science *all* theories are provisional.  Someone could come along in the next few years with a new theory that better explains the evidence.|`|t8BGljYWaa	A few comments are in order, but I think it has been "proven beyond reasonable doubt."<br>  <br>  First, the Big Bang theory as it was initially conceived had a few problems, among them:<br>  <br>  1)  It couldn't explain Large Scale Structure like galaxy clusters in the universe.<br>  <br>  2) The estimate it gave for the age of the universe was younger than the estimated ages of old stars in globular clusters.<br>  <br>  In order to fix these problems, and others, scientists created the inflationary model of expansion to modify the big bang theory. Basically, inflation posits that in a very short time, the early universe increased in size exponentially and then stopped.<br>  <br>  The main experimental evidence for the big bang is as far as I'm concerned:<br>  <br>  1)The distribution of elements in the observed universe (specifically, hydrogen and helium) is very consistent with the distribution of elements predicted by big bang cosmology<br>  <br>  2) The cosmic microwave background, posited earlier but first observed in the 60s, is exactly as big bang theory + inflation would predict it to be: i.e. a certain temperature at a certain redshift with certain variations.<br>  <br>  So yes, for all intents and purposes, it appears that the big bang + inflation explain the current state of the universe. There's only one problem: no consensus has been reached on how and why inflation happened, so it's basically an arbitrary suggestion that just happens to work. From a philosophy of science perspective, this doesn't make a very sound theory, so I'd have to conclude that the basic premise of the big bang has been proven but that other, important factors of early cosmology (that are usually lumped in as "big bang theory") are still in some doubt.|`|f5080642a85b57a445d9e4d43d1f865aaa	I fully support AstroGeek's answer! The word "theory" used in exact disciplines like astronomy, physics and mathematics does not mean something vague that they believe in. It is a well thought-of construct, based on many observations, weighted against many ideas, but can be falsified by a single experiment, which shows, that the theory must be wrong or must be adapted in a limit.<br>  (An example of this adaptation from Newtonian kinematics is Einsteins special relativity theory. Is therefore Newton's theory invalid? Only in the limits of speeds near light speed: If light speed was infinite, no adaptations were needed. And in our normal life we use Newtonian calculations, because that is much easier and gives us the high accuracy we need.)<br>  <br>  By the way, since time started to be defined by the big bang itself (according to the theory), you cannot talk about "before the big bang", because there was no "before" defined. This sounds crazy, but all observations lead to this conclusion. <br>  <br>  The universe is a crazy place to be in. Quantum-physicists know that all too well.<br>  The fact that the universe is the way it is, is only because we are here to observe it. We were not there in any other universe: No way our fertile earth could have been formed around an energy spending star, if physics were only slightly different.<br>  <br>  We can only sit and watch, looking through telescopes, making strange experiments with multi-billion Dollar/Pound/Euro/Yen devices (like with the LHC in CERN), etc.(!), and combine all measurements and existing working partial theories to create a new theory, which accounts for ALL observations, and with which we can predict the outcome of new measurements. If any of these predictions fail to be observed, we didn't do our homework well and need to go back to the drawing board.<br>  <br>  The big bang theory is based on MANY observations, including all measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, all experiments in particle accelerators (CERN, Fermilab, SLAC, ...) and neutrino detectors, (Super Kamiokande, ...) and (radio-)telescopic observations, also from many satellites (Hubble, COBE, WMAP, ...).<br>  <br>  NOBODY has measured ANYTHING (yet!) that can falsify the big bang theory, so consider this theory as well established and proven beyond any reasonable doubt.<br>  <br>  This "proven beyond any reasonable doubt" still has an opening for falsification, so maybe, someday, there will be a need for a new theory, or only an adaptation of the present theory (compare Newton -> Einstein).|`|hiflzw3paa	There is evidence that the universe is expanding and galaxies are getting farther apart, which if you run time in reverse means all matter gets closer and closer, hotter, and hotter to some this may indicate that at some point all matter was condensed infinitely small and "exploded" outwards otherwise known as a big bang.|`|WgHIEPvGaa	The word THEORY always meas that it has NOT been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. the fact is that we only know for sure ONE THING.

They can only be supported (or contradicted to) by evidence we observe. Stephen Hawking in A Brief History of Time states, "Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory. On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory."<br>  <br>  So far, the observable evidence supports the Big Bang theory.|`|4RJKl1aKaa	Not conclusively.  Indeed there are certain holes in the theory that need patching up, which is why the theory is constantly evolving as these are filled and new problems emerge.  <br>  <br>  What we can say without a doubt is that the evidence available fits the Big Bang model much better than any competing theory.|`|vqdNEtYPaa	All of the observable evidence supports the Big Bang theory.  Is it beyond a reasonable doubt?

SvmZlLdaaa	The lion is not called the king because it can 'whoop' any other animal. If that were the case, humans would be king - we are by far the most aggressive, destructive and dangerous animal on Earth. Lions have been called 'the king of beasts' for centuries, due to their majestic appearance and position as a top predator. In addition, male lions stalking among their females and cubs may remind humans of a king lording it over his subjects. As people have become more and more 'civilised' and lost touch with nature, it has become common to call any wild animals 'jungle animals' - hence, the king of beasts becomes king of the jungle.<br>  <br>  Whilst it's true that the majority of lions live on the open plains of Africa, there is a small population of Asiatic lions in the Gir Forest of India, and this subspecies was once much more widespread in Asia. These lions are probably more fitting of the title king of the jungle than their African cousins, but equally there are other majestic top predators, like tigers, that could also be considered deserving of the title. I suppose you could consider the elephant for the title too, but generally speaking herbivores do not command the same sort of respect and admiration as carnivores. Plus, if you compared someone to an elephant, it would most likely be taken as an insult - it would be assumed you were saying the person was heavy, wrinkly, big-nosed or similar. Whereas, if you call someone a lion, it is taken as a compliment - you are saying they are brave, strong, proud and so on. These are the sorts of qualities we want our leaders to have, and because we see them in lions, we like to think of them as leaders in the animal world.|`|axKQq9nXaa	There are prides of lions who hunt and kill elephants for food.

wJTsifugaa	I would pick a mixed flow reactor.  By definition, they have a mixer, but that is not the only reason.  A batch reactor is out, simply because you have defined this as a continuous reaction.  The one key issue here is the production of CO2.  It will form at a large rate and must be vented off.  Plug flow reactors are enclosed and the CO2 would cause foaming and pressurization inside the reactor and could choke off the flow through it.  The mixed flow reactor can be sized to deal with this, and it has a large surface area to help the CO2 to rise out of the solution.  The mixer will assist in contacting the solid CaCO3 with the HF.

Por lo que si hay mucha tensión (por eso la de casa es 125, o 220, y la industrial 380) hay mas corriente, y mata. O si hay poca resistencia (pies mojados, la ducha, etc) te puede matar con poca tensión. Además, depende de por donde pase esa corriente: cuando tocas un cable, la corriente pasa desde la mano a tierra, en los pies.

La tensión o voltaje realmente hace referencia a una diferencia de potencial eléctrico entre dos puntos.<br>  <br>  Realizando un símil algo forzado, podemos asociarlo a la energía potencial respecto a la energía cinética. Cuando estás a una determinada altura, por ejemplo, a 20 metros, lo crítico no es dicha altura, sino la diferencia respecto al siguiente nivel (digamos el suelo, a una altura de 0 metros). Puedes estar a 20 metros sin que sufras ningún da?o (en una monta?a, en un sexto piso), o bien con alto riesgo de accidente (en un precipicio). Tu diferencia de energía potencial por estar a dicha altura puede convertirse en energía cinética, si te resbalas y te caes, lo cual te producirá un impacto contra el suelo. Cuanta mayor sea tu energía potencial (cuanto más alta sea la altura donde estás respecto a la altura donde puedes caer), más velocidad alcanzarás en la caída (mayor energía cinética). Lo crítico, por lo tanto, es:<br>  - la diferencia de alturas (la energía potencial);<br>  como:<br>  - la conversión de dicha diferencia de altura en velocidad (la energía cinética);<br>  <br>  Pero jamás te matará una gran altura (pues la gente no podría vivir en las monta?as ni viajar en avión), si bien puede matarte una gran velocidad estando prácticamente siempre a la misma altura (los accidentes de tráfico).<br>  <br>  Ahora se trata de utilizar el mismo ejemplo para la corriente eléctrica y la tensión. Verás que es muy similar:<br>  - todos nos encontramos a una determinada tensión (digamos 0 Voltios, igual que establecemos por convenio que la altura del nivel del mar es 0 metros);<br>  - si se produce una diferencia de tensión (por ejemplo al tocar un enchufe), es equivalente a dejarnos caer desde una altura, pues ponemos nuestro cuerpo a otra tensión (digamos 220 V);<br>  - cuando creamos una diferencia de tensión, entonces se genera una corriente (cuando nos dejamos caer desde una altura, se genera una velocidad);<br>  - la relación entre la diferencia de tensión y la corriente viene dada por la resistencia del cuerpo, por ello, cuanto mayor sea la diferencia de tensión, mayor es la corriente que genera, del mismo modo a que la velocidad a la que caigamos dependerá de la resistencia del medio (no será la misma si caemos desde un tercer piso en el aire, o si "caemos" en una piscina);<br>  <br>  ?Qué quiere decir esto en la práctica?<br>  1. que cuando alguien por accidente ha tocado un enchufe o cable y está recibiendo una descarga, jamás debemos cogerle, pues sufriremos la misma descarga, y debemos separarlo de la fuente de corriente (el aparato eléctrico o lo que sea) con algún material de alta resistencia (un palo de madera, un palo de plástico, etc...), debiendo evitar los materials de baja resistencia (principalmente metales);<br>  2. que debemos evitar tener equipos eléctricos cerca de zonas húmedas (el agua de grifo es fuertemente conductora, tiene muy baja resistencia);<br>  3. que si sospechamos que algún aparato tiene alguna fuga de corriente, jamás debemos comprobarlo tocándolo, especialmente con la mano abierta. En casos excepcionales y para equipos de baja tensión (alimentados por baterías, por ejemplo) puede probarse con el dorso de la mano, pues si se produce alguna descarga, la mano reaccionará cerrándose y separándose de la fuente de corriente;<br>  <br>  Puedes revisar más detalles sobre la relación entre la tensión y la corriente en las referencias que te adjunto.

Vamos, que sales ardiendo.<br>     La intensidad te mata porque te paraliza los músculos.<br>     Una intensidad superior a 30 miliamperios ya puede ser muy peligrosa y como el cuerpo humano tiene una resistencia aproximada de 5 megahomios significa que hacen falta unos 150000 voltios para conseguir esa corriente.

N0fM0kXxaa	I think that the only way to avoid getting tired is by conditioning your body to be able to perform after continued exercise, like playing basketball.  You don't have to go to a gym to get conditioned.  Playing full court pickup or scrimmaging at practice are probably the best ways of building your endurance.  When you're training and you get tired, don't come off the court, keep working hard to strengthen your body.  Do extra conditioning after practice, if you want to play you have to work harder than your competition.  Good luck.|`|13F3NzZhaa	well either way your going to have to exercise, i don't know if thats what you meant by not going to a gym, but you should try wearing a heavy vest like the one i wear when i don't want Iraqis to kill me.

Example a chest exercise, a leg exercise, an ab or back exercise like circuit training but not as many exercises at once and because your lifting in pyramids you end up lifting heavy at the peak.<br>  To increase speed try doing your specific sport motions like a practitioner of Tae Chi. Very slowly and with dynamic tension. This will really work good, trust me. Breathe deep.<br>  To increase how long your strength lasts, run really far, really slow. We used to do this on our Sunday Long Runs. Real far, real slow. Make your gas tank bigger. The benefits of the 2 types of work outs will marry. making you faster and for a longer period of time.<br>  You have to play basketball like a boxer fights. Pace yourself, emotionally and physically relax, stay loose between spurts of energy. Way easier said than done, it takes experience.<br>  Lastly, wind sprints. Totally recover between sprints, meaning let your heart rate come right back to resting rate, then sprint again. By fully recovering your teaching your body to recover better and faster.<br>  Good luck!

The closer in size particles and waves get, the easier it is to scatter the waves. Because blue light has the shortest wavelength, it will scatter more easily due to the small molecules in our atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Because of the low angle of the Sun at sunrise and sunset, blue light is more easily scattered away from us.

BrarMA1Haa	Most of the input power into an IR LED is converted to waste heat.  Only a fraction is emitted as infrared radiation (IR).<br>  <br>  For example, the first URL shows an IR LED at 1050nm.  Near the bottom of the data sheet, it gives the Electro-Optical Characteristics.  Typical values are:<br>  <br>  Input power:  1.25V x 50mA = 62.5mW<br>  Radiated power:  1.0mW<br>  <br>  Thus, the conversion efficiency is:<br>  <br>  eff = 1.0mW / 62.5mW = 1.6%<br>  <br>  What this means is that 1.6% of the input power is radiated as infrared radiation.  The remaining 98.4% is turned into heat that makes the LED feel warm.<br>  <br>  I presume that you are searching for IR LEDs that emit a high percentage of IR, and minimal waste heat.  You will need to examine carefully either the efficiency rating or both the input power and output radiation.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Stars are formed in giant clouds of dust and gas, and progress through their normal life as balls of gas heated by thermonuclear reactions in their cores. Depending on their mass, they reach the end of their evolution as a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole.<br>  <br>  If the star is about the same mass as the Sun, it will turn into a white dwarf star. If it is somewhat more massive, it may undergo a supernova explosion and leave behind a neutron star. But if the collapsing core of the star is very great -- at least three times the mass of the Sun -- nothing can stop the collapse. The star implodes to form an infinite gravitational warp in space -- a black hole. <br>  <br>  A star collapses when the fuel is used up and the energy flow from the core of the star stops. Nuclear reactions outside the core cause the dying star to expand outward in the "red giant" phase before it begins its inevitable collapse. <br>  <br>  The cycle begins anew as an expanding supershell from one or more supernovas trigger the formation of a new generation of stars. Brown dwarfs have a mass of only a few percent of that of the Sun and cannot sustain nuclear reactions, so they never evolve.|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	BIRTH:<br>  <br>  Stars are "born" from the gravitational collapse of cool, dense interstellar clouds. A cloud has to be of a certain mass for gravitational collapse to occur, & a trigger is needed for the collapse to start, since the clouds are held up by their own internal pressure & magnetic fields. Such a trigger might be as simple as the gravitational tug from a passing star, or it might be a shock wave caused by the blast of a supernova, or the collision of two or more galaxies. In the Milky Way, density waves move through the dust and gas in the galactic disk. As the waves pass, they temporarily increase the local density of interstellar material, triggering the collapse. The material heats up as it collapses until, in some clouds, the temperature & pressure at their centers become so great that nuclear fusion begins & a star is born.<br>  <br>  TOWARD THE MAIN SEQUENCE:<br>  <br>  At this stage, stars are very unstable. They lose mass by expelling strong stellar winds, which are often directed in two opposing jets chanelled by a disk of dust and gas at their equators (the accretion disk). Gradually, balance between gravity and pressure are equalized, and stars settle down on to the main sequence, where stars spend 90% of their life, fusing hydrogen into helium at its core.<br>  <br>  GROWING OLD & BUYING THE FARM<br>  <br>  When a star of the Sun's mass exhausts the hydrogen at its core, hydrogen-shell burning begins, and it expands into a red giant, often losing its outer layers to produce a planetary nebula. It eventually collapses, and the temperature & pressure at its core initiate helium-core burning. The star again expands as helium-shell burning occurs, before finally collapsing to become a white dwarf (about Earth-sized) that gradually fades to black.|`|hiflzw3paa	Actually our sun is not quite medium sized if we want to split hairs, it is a small-medium star. After our sun runs out of Hydrogen it will contract until the core is hot enough to start nuclear fusion of Helium and expand again. Once Helium is depleted it will contract and begin to fuse other elements. This process will continue until nuclear fusion can no longer take place due to a lack of gravitational energy created by its mass. A white dwarf star will mark the beginning of the end as the star eventually cools and becomes a brown dwarf no longer emitting enough light to be detected or sustain life.|`|fnXN6cKSaa	It burns up its available fuel, then expands and cools, then contracts and end up as a dead ball of ash.|`|dcbc2e59c2687ca41308cf562932328baa	Its death will be in about 5 billion years when it goes Supernova, just wait around a bit you'll see.

Walker figures that about 10 percent of the Amazon basin has already been deforested. The estimate takes on a frightening dimension when you consider that the Amazon area--all two million square miles of it--is nearly three times the size of the planet's next largest rain forest. More trees are being destroyed daily there than anywhere else in the world, Walker says. The thousands of miles of rutted jungle roads that he rambled over may be the most accountable culprit. For more than 20 years, the Brazilian government has maintained a policy of cutting new trails through the Amazon, to open up the area for economic reasons. While it has reportedly discontinued the practice now, the government for years offered enormous tax incentives to logging, cattle ranching and farming operations alike if they would agree to pioneer the area. Every time a new road opens, migrant farmers from the city looking for a new start as well as well-heeled loggers and cattle ranchers have pounced on these now vulnerable areas. There are now so many people living in the forest that the country's social services don't even begin to keep up with them.|`|DzeJ1ODQaa	too much ;(|`|IcvcfNxJaa	Who cares? it is a JUNGLE and if they want to cut it down for whatever reason it is their business not yours.
