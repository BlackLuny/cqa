4vLt3SqFaa	October 1917 the Bolsheviks seize power and begin tearing down the old system and by 1921 the entire land is in famine.  The entire world laughs at the early efforts of communism believing it doomed from the start and it stayed desperately poor and non-functional for many years as the depression raged in the US.  About the only friend the Bolsheviks had in the world was the American industrialist Armand Hammer.  His exact motivations are not understood and probably never will be. What is clear is that he provided the fledgling government a lifeline when one was desperately needed. <br>  <br>  He brought them surplus wheat to keep the population from starving and in return got concessions for factories which earned him millions although the question of salve labor has been bandied about and again is probably an unsolvable mystery.<br>  <br>  Then in world war II only MASSIVE aid form the west kept the government both militarily and politically viable - even so the losses in the war were so huge that most of us in the west can hardly comprehend - over 23,000,000 deaths. That is over 13% of the population.  The US by contrast suffered 418,500 deaths - or less than one third of one percent of the population.  <br>  <br>  It can be argued that the USSR did not begin to recover from WWII until well into the 1960's and the standard of living remained for all but the most privileged at least a couple generations behind their western counterparts.  In truth as long as Communism survives - even in part, it continues to hold Russia back for real economic prosperity.  <br>  <br>  So has Russia had econimic recession?  The first 6-8 decades I would say were a period of certainly sub optimal growth at best or really negative growth  in some areas we you consider the amount of subsidies involved.<br>  <br>  The history os Russia has demonstrated the inability of government to either spend their way out of a crisis or to even plan effectively for a crisis.|`|qDsrQIhIaa	Yes they have because the USSR went bankrupt during the cold war.|`|AA12071655	Increased government spending actually increases a recession. What Obama is doing (dont' get me wrong, I support the man) is a big gamble.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	You hit on an important point.  Socialist systems do not generate wealth like Capitalist systems do.  (see China today as opposed to ten years ago).  So they do not have business cycles.  No cycles no boom years no recessions.  Basically, a Socialist system is in a permanent Depression.  During the Great Depression in America, people stood in line for rationed food same as everyday in the Soviet Union.<br>  <br>  Without the Capitalist motivation for profit and competition leading to ever improving production efficiency and competition, Socialism quickly stalls out and never changes.  Why build a newer more efficient factory if you have to keep people employed anyway?  <br>  <br>  Since the Soviet Government could not generate any real wealth, their currency was nearly worthless elsewhere in the world so printing more of it had no effect but to make it even less valuable.  <br>  <br>  An important concept people need to get is that in a Socialist System you have no liberty.  You are just one of many and completely expendable.  The all powerful central government eats gourmet and the rest of us stand in line for hours for a loaf of bread.  <br>  <br>  In Capitalist America, you walk down the coffee aisle of any Supermarket and have your choice of many brands and kinds of coffee.  In the Soviet Union  any coffee was so hard to get people had to reuse the grounds three times. <br>  <br>  You simply cannot do what the Democrats are doing.  You cannot just print more money.  Jimmy Carter tried that with horrible results.  The government does not have any money because they produce nothing.  What they spend they take from the only source of wealth in America, the private sector.<br>  <br>  So, if you give some people $6,000 to help pay their mortgages you first have to take it from other people who also pay mortgages as well as renters who do not even own a home.  Why should renters or homeowners help pay off someone elses mortgage?<br>  <br>  *|`|LUQX6Wglaa	Communism = no incentive<br>  <br>  Name me one invention that came from the USSR that benefitted the world.

What an idiot.<br>  <br>  So I suppose the Kinescope and the Iconoscope that were required for a television to work invented themselves out in the open ocean somewhere by God. To my knowledge, most Americans watch TV to some degree. How about the pressure suit? Good luck with our progress in the plane department if a Russian communist hadn't invented the suit that keeps you alive at high altitudes. How about the coating that goes over every single lens in production that keeps light from reflecting away from it, to exponentially increase the efficiency of both things as small as eyeglasses or camera lenses to whole observatory telescopes? Try communist Russia in early WWII. Oh, and somehow somebody forgot the AK-47, one of the most widely recognized and widely used guns in the world since just after WWII.<br>  <br>  There's plenty of incentive in communism. Unfortunately, neither communism nor capitalism are the answers to economic stability.

tqD9xUpYaa	Well, it sounds to be like your friend hasn't been convicted yet so you're actually asking about what happens when he was falsely accused and charged with a crime.  Depending upon where it is, he'll be extradited from his current state back to the local community where the crime took place and be arraigned and eventually tried (probably in the county court system).  Or he should just turn himself in if there's a warrant for his arrest.<br>  <br>  He can call you collect or write you a letter to let you know where he's at.  Or you can check that county sheriff's website once he's been extradited.|`|AA11622716	If he has already been convicted, the trial is over.  Your info is wrong.  Figure out what you want to know and ask it.|`|AA11752525	Dear Holliewood,<br>  <br>                    Extradition is not an exact science. Many states will not use the state to state transfer process to prosecute individuals charged with misdemeanors (i.e. crimes punishable for a term less that one year) Other states will consider extralegal evidence, including the nature of the crime, the treatment of the charge/crime within the state from which extradition is sought and possible new evidence.<br>  <br>                Some states will just say to the state seeking extradition to come and take him....you have X days after which we will release him. Under certain circumstances, the state possessing the conviction will just say "Forget it!...We don't want him."<br>  <br>                 Many more facts need to be presented. Criminality is a growth idustry for many states and politics may sway the extraduction process.<br>  <br>                   A good and independant  attorney is required to best protect your friend. Public Defenders lack the.time, resources and motivational interest to move beyond the barest efforts.<br>  <br>                   Make certain you send paper and  self-stamped envelopes to your friend to allow you to follow his trail. Once transferred, telephone privileges can take weeks to establish and movement may be weekly. No, it is not a great process and no one cares much if you do or do not have the capability to follow your friend. Often even the friends' Attorney has no ability or precise knowledge of the clients location.|`|ADSCOgxmaa	what'd you do homie

Waiting Period and Parental Notification. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Ballot Summary<br>  Amends California Constitution to bar abortion on unemancipated minor until 48 hours after physician notifies minor’s parent/legal guardian, except in medical emergency or with parental waiver. However, the abortion can still be enacted by the minor with or without the parent's approval after the parents have been notified. Permits judicial waiver of notice based on clear and convincing evidence of minor’s maturity or minor’s best interests. Physician must report abortions performed on minors and State shall compile statistics. Authorizes monetary damages for violation. Minor must consent to abortion unless mentally incapable or in medical emergency. Permits judicial relief if minor’s consent to abortion is coerced.

It would have required parents be notified if their daughter was going to get an abortion.<br>  <br>  So you certainly don't need a parent as they don't even need notified and I am 90% sure there are clinics and organizations that offer abortions at no charge to the woman/girl in question.<br>  <br>  On a side note, isn't it funny that a teenage girl needs permissions from her parent/guardian to go on a school field trip to the zoo for say, a biology class, but doesn't need permission to terminate a pregnancy - a decision which has FAR more serious ramifications both physically and mentally?
suGCTcataa	Its not as simply as you think. <br>  <br>  Companies filing for bankruptcy, usually see an opportunity in the future; but such a venture comes at a cost, of course. A bankruptcy claim only incurs if the company claiming is large enough to make all the necessary payments, which in most cases add up to billions of dollars. <br>  And it also must draw up a proper, realistic, and viable plan, one which must guarantee the re-introduction of the company into the market.<br>  <br>  And in some specials cases, the costs can run into the tens of billions of dollars; so, as you can see, one would only want to accept bankruptcy unless one has absolutely no other option.|`|1hOTlMvaaa	It is what the Repubs are about business at any cost to whom ever!

Kh4p4gPXaa	IT sounds to me like this guy flew off the handle and doesn't know his job.   <br>  <br>  It might be different in your state,   but here its not shoplifting until you leave the store with the concealed item.   I would tell your attorney what you said here about never having left the register area.    Let the judge decide,  but I personally dont see the crime here.<br>  <br>  I'll just tie up some loose ends.    Yes,  he can touch you and detain you using reasonable force until the police arrive,   and a misdemeanor is essentially a "minor crime",  as in that it wont carry as stiff a penalty as a felony (murder,  etc).|`|4lbgJXI0aa	sounds to me like he over reacted... anyway if you're in the store as long as you didn't intend to break the law you haven;t broken any laws.<br>  and FYI a misdemeanor is a crime that you get little to no jail time for and most of the time end up just paying a fine. it's a step below a felony.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	If you had to leave the store to get more money you should have either put everything back or paid for what you could, and then come back later. You were walking past the registers on the way to the door, sorry but you can't take products out of the store without paying. If they wait until you are out the door, you could have a friend in a car outside and you'd be gone. You can hope that a judge believes you didn't intend to steal, but I doubt it.|`|gaN6hbbGaa	Where i am from you are not shoplifting until you have completely left the store, aka-out of the doors. Since you were clearly not past the registers it would be impossible for you to be out of the doors and thus it is not shoplifting. Further more since you had the product visible they cannot claim that you had intend to conceal the product for the purpose of theft. As for the actions of the loss prevention worker, he was likely out of line in his actions. Since you were clearly not trying to evade him or resist in any way then he had no right to tackle you. This could be put under the legal realm of excessive force.<br>  In a court of law intent is by far the hardest thing to prove along with motive unless there is solid evidence. Since you had not left nor should there be any evidence that you did not intend to pay then you should be clear.
bbb51eeb731786c5f1db8432f39fb0a2aa	I don't know if it was intended to be racial, but it certainly appears to be.  It wasn't so long ago that many people believed blacks were closer to primates and therefore inferior to other human races.<br>  <br>  A chimpanzee was killed after attacking someone.  The president is the individual most closely associated with the stimulus bill.  Why did the cartoonist attempt to connect those two things in the body of a dead chimp.  Connecting random events?  Maybe.  Chimpanzee and black man associated in the cartoonist's mind?  Maybe.<br>  <br>  Add to that: the chimp nearly killed someone.  The chimp was killed.  The president seems to be a higher assassination risk than most.  The cartoon is depicting an actual death associated with an actual near-death and a feared death.  That's a lot of lines to cross and a professional cartoonist should know better than to cross them.  And that's what makes this different from the frequent Bush-monkey cartoons.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Since Pelosi and Reid wrote the stimulus bill, how could it have been racist?

UpZFb6X5aa	Good question. The answer is that it's not an assumption, exactly. It's political/religious indoctrination--brainwashing, in other words. And it's only one of many such--here's a few more for which you can verify the facts on your own with a few minutes surfing the web:<br>  <br>  >all liberals are atheists (false: most Christians are liberals, not conservatives)<br>  >most people on welfare are unmarried minority mothers (false--the majority are white married women whose husbands left them).<br>  >liberals (and Obama) oppose any military action against the terrorists. (false--Obama and liberals generally , have called for YEARS for us to focus our military efforts on al-Caida--the people who actually attacked us)<br>  <br>  There's lots more. Don't try convincing any neo-con of the correct facts. You cannot argue--or reason--with some one who has accepted such beliefs as religious doctrine backed up by careful indoctrination.|`|r6dJTGQKaa	they don't think...and therein lies the problem.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	I wasn't aware of this assumption your making as even being an issue.<br>  Although...its not human nature as suggested by one answerer, but the steps of socialism from saul Luwenski's book....rules for radicals.<br>  You isolate your target, target it , marginalize it, confuse and mis-inform people, attack and destroy their reputation.<br>  This is todays liberalism.<br>  A famous socialist once said "America will never accept socialism, but under the guise of liberalism they will accept every socialist ethic".|`|1CxcmMdiaa	I think that it's generally a fair assumption. Most liberals are either un-employed, or haven't been around long enough to see the ineffiiencies of government charity when compared with private charity.<br>  <br>  If the government let us keep our money so we could donate to which charity we choose on a voluntary basis... I guarentee that the quality of many programs AND their efficiency would go up because they would be competing against each other for greater attention.<br>  <br>  FACT - The government spends WAY more money getting any job done than the private sector because they're not spending THEIR money!|`|NvOro0igaa	I live in a very hard core conservative area, and there are armies of unemployed people.

These poor fools are allergic to facts. They think they can make something up and if they shout it loud enough, it's true.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	I don't think they have any truthful arguments to make, so they resort to silly blanket statements like that.

Many also believe that only "dems , blacks, and Mexicans" are on welfare. <Rolleyes>|`|5cfnDmI7aa	well I think the reason conservatives say that is because its hard to believe anyone with a job would actually support what dems support. do all demos really think all republicans are against gay marriage?

My concern out of all of this, is why people are still gloating on Palin and her family, I mean YOUR party won for Gods' sake get over it! <br>   At this time we need more people to worry about whats going on with this country under Obamas watch cause it certainly is going down the crapper but most are too blind to see it!<br>  I truly think why you keep Palins family in the spot light is because she MAY run in 2012 and she just might win after four yrs of obama BS! Nobody seems to critique anything obama does wrong and there has been plenty of mistakes!<br>  I will repeat, that a parent can only preach so much and children will do what they want!!!

What's the difference between killing a baby in the womb or outside the womb? Is it easier because you didn't have to see it, touch it or hear it cry?

What is the difference?<br>  <br>  Before you say because you were born you need to remember that President Obama (Democrat) voted 4 times against outlawing live birth abortions! Which means if the baby survives the abortion and is in need of medical care a doctor can not treat the baby.

I believe that your "right" to be selfish vanishes the minute you find out you are pregnant. It isn't about just you anymore. That argument carries absolutely NO weight with me. I could give a f**k about women's rights when it comes to this. <br>  <br>  People keep trying to say that abortion is a legal issue, not a moral one.

Not that you'll believe that... it makes you feel better to demonize people like me, who fully supported our invasion of Afghanistan but thought Iraq was a horrible idea from Day One.  Soldiers take orders; I don't blame them for what they're doing.  They can go to jail if they refuse to follow orders.  I blame Bush for taking his eye off the ball and never finishing what he started in Afghanistan.  For never finding Osama bin Laden.  And I know, I know, if Evil Devil Bill Clinton Who Is Responsible For Everything Bad That Has Ever Happened had only taken him out when he could, 9/11 would never have happened, right?  Except that you guys keep telling us that bin Laden wasn't really responsible, that he's not as important in al Qaida as liberals keep saying he is.  So I guess it WOULD have happened.  Regardless... I am generally opposed to war, though I am not stupid, I know it is a necessary evil sometimes.  Iraq was NOT necessary, and Bush had no right to send our soldiers there.  He had the AUTHORITY to do so, but he had no right.<br>  <br>  It has NOTHING to do with the soldiers.  Afghanistan is a war which needed to happen.  Iraq was not.  Bush mostly ignored Afghanistan in favor of finding Saddam Hussein.<br>  <br>  THAT was our problem.  Not the soldiers.|`|D9l4HLKKaa	They love it lap it like cream.<br>  Obama Brayed our Boys DIE.<br>  Hypocritical bastards.<br>  They still won't be soldiers that is safer for the military anyway.|`|d4b619c10771cb613c956622f5ad31acaa	Liberals do appreciate our soldiers.

1KGXts5Daa	Okay, after reading your question I am able to, 1) Offer my sympathy for what sounds like a very frustrating situation for you to have gone through, and, 2) offer some explanation to what was going on - legally - behind the actions taken in your situation.<br>  <br>  First, you already made perfectly clear that you realize what a bad idea it was having someone with a suspended drivers license drive you anywhere - or drive at all.  Nothing more needs to be said on that.<br>  <br>  The police officer was required to establish "probable cause" before he could legally stop you.  Driving a vehicle with only one operable headlight is sufficient (and pretty common) probable cause (PC).<br>  <br>  Why? When it was still daylight?  Because the vehicle code (the "law" under which this particular officer had PC to stop you in this particular instance) does not differentiate between daytime and nighttime, sunny and cloudy, clear and foggy/rainy, or anything else as to *when* a vehicle needs to have operable headlights - per the code, it always must.<br>  <br>  Had your husband not have been driving on a suspended license, the officer would have simply issued a "fix-it ticket", there would have been no fine, no court appearance, nothing required of you other than fixing the headlight.<br>  <br>  But we know that's not how things went.  So, to the next part of your question: the search of the vehicle.<br>  <br>  The law is very clear, and law enforcement officers constantly trained, on what constitutes a legal search versus an illegal search (which can and has changed a bit throughout my lifetime).<br>  <br>  One of those instances which is absolutely 100% legal is "search subsequent to an arrest".  Once the officer had PC to make a vehicle stop he had legal authority to "run" the driver (through a database), once the officer was informed that the driver had a suspended license the officer had the legal authority to make the arrest.  Once the officer made the arrest, he had the legal authority to search both the "person" of the driver, and the vehicle which that driver had control over at the time of the arrest.<br>  <br>  Because your purse and shopping bags were in the car, they were legally subject to search. (Had you - let's say - been standing outside of the car with your purse over your shoulder, closed and secured, that officer would have likely  felt that he did not have legal authority to search your purse without your consent).<br>  <br>  As it was, from your description, the search of the vehicle was conducted correctly by the officer.<br>  <br>  As to discussing the "bond" amount (are you sure the officer didn't say BAIL), this is not typical - however not illegal - for an officer to do.<br>  <br>  As to your other issues related to the process of posting bail (and your opinion that the officer was acting like a "jerk"), all I can offer is that nothing from what you relate was illegal about any of it.<br>  <br>  Don't know whether that is what you wanted to hear, but it is the honest - and legal - truth.|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	sounds like you were in a drug area, no he can't search your car without your permission but if you have nothing to hide you should give permission, in many states the police can pull you over for for having any defective equipment I once failed an inspection in Maryland because I didn't have a cigarette lighter in the car the guy said according to Maryland law everything that was originally in the car had to be operational even the radio! Many police depts also pull over vehicles that appear poorly maintained on the premise that if your car looks like a piece of junk the brakes are probably bad the tires are probably bad etc.|`|2phQg8baaa	Ok all you have to do is to argue the officer didnt have reasonable suspicion to pull you over and everything that happened after can be undone.<br>  In order for the cop to pull you over, he must have seen (1) a broken headlight, (2) a headlight not working at night. According to your statement, this didn't happen. Have your attorney grill the arresting officer on the bench and if he's good, he can get this undone.<br>  The search incident to arrest of your husband was legal but just of the car. He isn't allowed to search your purse unless you gave permission or he arrested you. Either way, the search didn't reveal anything illegal so you don't a case here.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  In my opinion the cop is right. He cannot keep a vigil to see at what times you are driving the car has to be in proper working condition.<br>  These times are bad with terror threat you do not know so they have a right to check. Usually the stolen cars are not in proper working condition. So he has to clear his doubts. And about the debit card thing ask your bank.|`|uSeApMt9aa	I am not sure about the defective equipment but it doesn't seem right. But what i do know is the law on searching known as the terry stop. Includes this statement- "A Terry Stop has two components:  the stop and then the frisk.  When an officer conducts a Terry Stop, he/she must have reasonable suspicion that a crime or criminal activity has, is, or is about to be committed" When they found out your husband was driving on a suspended license the crime was already committed giving the cop the right to search your vehicle with or without permission. The cop was ignorant and you can't really change a persons attitude or personality but it isn't illegal. The only reason i can say it was declined is because of the amount of money involved. In my bank of america debit if i buy an item that is over 300$ it gets declined. When that happens you call the card company and answer security questions and they will authorize it. However you should seek a lawyer for the best interest of your husband and see about the defective equipment law. Good luck
cL6CWj2waa	well ya gotta be nice to the kids, sometimes kids don't have a choice, maybe some bigger, older punk influences/forces them to do a crime.<br>  <br>  an older person who has learnt their lessons, lived life, tends to know better and perhaps when it comes to kids vs adults, ignorance weighs heavier on adults.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	i don't think it is necessary. it's a waste of money. and if it's their own damn fault if they break the law, why baby them? maybe there should be one for just 12 and under. but once you're a teen, i think you should get the same treatment as an adult if you're going to break the law
npMVWV7raa	I go to SJSU (in San Jose, Ca) and I keep a low profile about myself being a USMC reservist because its my nature to do so.

Of course, I would not recommend attending school wherever it is that Ayers speaks at.<br>  <br>  By the way, military personnel are overwhelmingly more likely to vote with the Republicans, because unlike the liberals, Republicans can at least acknowledge how much we do for our country and do a good job of honoring that.<br>  <br>  And if they try to call you a warmonger or something stupid, you can let them know that there is not a sane man on this earth that goes to war and loves it. However, there are those that have the courage and the pride to risk everything for the better of others- something that the person insulting you clearly lacks.

AA11752525	Dear Pearl,<br>  <br>               From your characterization, I believe your husband was convicted of a crime to which he has been labeled a "sex offender" For example you might not consider public urination to be a sex crime. It might even seem strange and nominal. Most jurisdictions attach a sex offendel label to this crime.<br>  <br>               Parole conditions may include staying clean for drugs and holding down a job. Both are difficult conditions.<br>  Certainly the stress, pressure and obvious lack of state provided health/mental  treatment increase likelihood for relapse. And jobs are hard enough for anyone to maintain in this economy, much less a recently hired convicted felon with a sex offender label. <br>  <br>                Your depression is well earned and understandable. I believe the criminal process goes out of the way to punish family members of inmates. You should not be surprised by how many guilty convictions are manufactured under threat of having the spouse added to the criminal claims for giving aid, support or ostensibly "conspiring" to commit the underlying charges.<br>  <br>                 There is no answer.... You can run, duck and cover evading your financial debt for years. Your short term options are seeking aid and comfort by joining an organization for prisoner families. Many people have gone through your situation. Multiple family organizations exist.<br>  Most have newsletters and some have periodic meetings.<br>  <br>                  You likely need a heavy dose of spirtual support.. Consider going to your favorite worship center. You may want to try different centers if you have no present favorite.<br>  Appeal to the "highest" authority is often your best and only true recourse.<br>  <br>                   Best wishes.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	You haven't said why he was sent to prison if it wasn't a sex crime.<br>  And how did he "relapse"?

They think only in terms of absolutes, so they really can't.

One admission of error, or one exception to their ultimate ideological truth, and the whole thing comes crashing down.<br>  <br>  Another analogy would be to young earth creationism, which is actually required for Christianity to make any sense at all, for without a 6000-year old universe and the garden, the snake, and some rotten fruit, there is no original sin.

But When it comes to things like National security, the economy, abortion, and the war on terror, I tend to not see eye to eye with alot of democrats.

Except noting that federal posts must be elected every so often, it is not written about. This is because states were to oversee elections, not the federal government.  In effect, the parties normally oversee the election system, and so most reforms are really agreements between them.

DTSUJe2oaa	Early retirement refers to a retirement plan based with your employer and one that you have paid into where you have adequate income to support yourself, one factor you should consider is with Social Security your benefit amount is controlled by the amount you make while working so it could affect the amount you receive later. If you do not have a retirement plan you might want to consider a change in occupations to finish out your age requirement or if you have either physical or mental problems that cause you difficulty in working you can apply to SS disability.~
AA10818613	Nigeria.  But then again, look at that country and you can't say that anything but poverty and hunger are developing in that country.  Every 3rd world country is a perfect example of free trade and a laissez-faire system.  That should tell you something about that economic model.  It doesn't work for anyone except the corporation who has strong ties in the government to pretty much exploit that country for the natural resources at a give away rate.  You cannot sustain a democracy if you have corporations running things.  Corporations are not systems based in democracy.  Their systems are far more fuedal in nature and they have a tendency to be predatory.<br>  <br>  Actually, our government has produced alot of things including the following:<br>  U.S Postal Service,<br>  the internet<br>  NASA space system<br>  Universities that produce all kinds of research leading to advancements in pharmaceuticals, healthcare, medicine, advancements in engineering and science,  inventions, technologies, advancements in agriculture, biology, nutrition, childcare etc.<br>  Government produces policies that help sustain clean water, clean air, and clean food.<br>  Government creates policies that protect our communities including creating police depts., fire and healthcare facilities.<br>  Government creates schools of all levels and educated us and our children.<br>  <br>  So to say government never produces anything is an outright lie or is just outright ignorance.|`|LCqL6Z2laa	Exactly where did the government get their money, genius?<br>  <br>  Private Sector!<br>  <br>  Governments produce NOTHING - EVER.<br>  <br>  Governemnts control and restrict - that's it.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	Nope and you are correct.

And look what happened to them.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Allow me to prevent you from embarrassing yourself futher...<br>  <br>  While it's true that no economy has a 100% laissez-faire government approach, and i agree that government needs to get involved to a MINIMAL extent, but NEVER to a controlling extent (with the exception of the military and road repair), the fact is that the economies with the highest laissez-faire approach have the strongest economies.  The reason is so obvious it hurts- do you want enterprise run by DMV types, or do you want to bring out the creativity and competence of FREE enterprise.  Government programs are famous for bureaucratic bungling that defy logic and reason- Reagan became president on this premise.<br>  <br>  I think the Soviet Union is the best arguement to keep government OUT of economic decision making and let the free enterprise forces (aka "the people") decide on the best use of resources.  The arrogance you display seems only exceeded by your naivite- kind of like your leader Obama.
g2GSdY8Aaa	There are close ties between ACORN and Obama. He has funneled funds to them in the past and will continue to do everything in his power to prop them up in an effort to advance the left wing socialist agenda. I found this...<br>  <br>  After seven years of hiding corruption, ACORN has admitted Dale Rathke, brother of founder, Wade Rathke had embezzled nearly $1 million from the company. The embezzlement was only known to a few and was hidden from the remainder of the ACORN board. Unfortunately the wide scale corruption doesn’t even start with the embezzlement. The embezzlement is part of a much longer line of illegal activity. <br>  <br>  ACORN is connected to money laundering, misuse of taxpayer funds, voter fraud especially in the Presidential Primaries, Wage and Hour Issues among their employees, and even safety issues in their offices. They are interfering in gubernatorial races especially in the State of Indiana. Their interference in the political arena knows no bounds. ACORN is the umbrella company to at least 75 non-profits all operating out of 1024 Elysian Fields Avenue, New Orleans, LA as verified by the Secretary of State in Louisiana. It is time to examine their fraud and expose it for what it is. So here is their dirty laundry list to date.<br>  <br>  Money Laundering<br>  <br>  The money laundering that was identified by the Consumer Rights League was released in a report in June 2008. The money laundering happened in 1996 and involved the Teamster’s Union, causing the president’s election to be thrown out by federal authorities. ACORN’s Project Vote, which is tied to voter fraud, received $175,000 to perform a “non-partisanship” get-out-the-vote activity. Project Vote was to target votes that benefited the Clinton Campaign, congressional and senatorial races with emphasis on the votes for congress people and senators.<br>  The rest can be read here.<a href="http://theunionlabelblog.com/2008/07/25/obama%E2%80%99s-acorn-a-leftist-social-reform-group/" rel="nofollow">http://theunionlabelblog.com/2008/07/25/...</a>|`|13fDE4nGaa	isnt it so sweet that we have so many"SMART"educated morons in this country.<br>  <br>  Im glad i didnt waste my money on a DUES card<br>  that is what a college degree is<br>  <br>  A "DUES" CARD...........<br>  <br>  They fooled all of you .........didnt they?|`|l02Huqdlaa	When and where will this nightmare stop?

He may have been granted a pass by the media and his voters in his past and ongoing relationship with this group, but too many people (doesn't matter what party) have had enough of this sham. This group is under investigation, and they STILL received funds, for Obama to openly defend them is political suicide. They were funded in the stimulus.

I spit my coffee out on that one. You have GOT to be kidding me.|`|AA10818613	LOL, you have you anger directed in the wrong direction.  You're blaming the victims of the mortgage loan scandals.  The people who have ruined the banks and communities are the preditory lenders who are employed by the banks with the original loans to the home owners.  It's the banks that created this mess with preditory lending practices and you want to blame families and make them homeless as a result.  It's actually better to keep the families in these homes at least renting them if they can't afford the mortgages.  Then the homes don't deteriorate and make the entire neighborhood deteriorate.  That way the homes that people do still own in that neighborhood don't see their home values go down at such a fast rate that we are seeing now.<br>  <br>  BTW, it is unlawful for a bank to foreclose and kick a family out of their home if the bank can't produce the original deed and loan papers.  Most of those documents can't be found by the banks because they have been bundled and packaged up with other mortgages and sold many times over to many other banking institutions under the title of 'swaps'.  Quite blaming the victim.  The Banks who are stealing your tax dollars are the preditors in this, not the people who are losing their jobs, their homes and their american dream.  Most of these people could afford their homes until they either lost their jobs or found their houses so devalued and therefore 'underwater' from their original purchasing price that they lost the ability to pay for the place.

You trust one man (Obama the Messiah) and his advising cronies that are tax cheats over a bunch of people driven by profit incentive? Wow... <br>  <br>  And as to why Wall Street ran rampant in the first place, is because of government interference in the market, an over regulated banking industry, a reckless Federal Reserve monetary policy, and bad legislative policies. They took advantage of the scenario they were handed to by government and now you are looking for more government to fix the problem they created? <br>  <br>  Damn near a trillion dollars and it's not enough? Are you on crack? Should we just keep creating money out of thin air and push us closer to hyperinflation? You sound like those idiots that blame any failed government program on lack of funding, even if their funding is astronomical (e.g. our failing education system).

(Oddly, that money and the power to spend it were delegated him by a Congress elected in '06 to 'reign in' the power of the administration). <br>  <br>  So, then, just how can we trust this new guy operating under the same House and Senate? <br>  <br>  It would be unsettling enough if just one or two members of either house were disloyal to their constituencies.

Nor does the market understand the real economy since we've had a fake economy for the last 8 years based solely on ghost trading of financial markets, moving money around and calling it trading.  If our economy was truly stable and strong, it would be based on producing something in this country, not moving money around.  Geesuz, at least Obama is trying to do something about that with the stimulus plan, green jobs, and producing an economy that can't be outsourced.   I'll trust his decisions over Wall Street's any day.  Isn't that quite obvious by now to you that Wall Street doesn't know what the f**K it's doing since it has gotten us into this economic mess in the first place?  HELLO!  The traders and the 'masters of the universe' on Wall Street failed and now you're trusting it to tell you the truth about the stimulus?  Geesuz.  If the stimulus fails it's because it's not enough money in the stimulus package being injected into the system.  In other words, it's not big enough.  Obama is going to have to come back for more.  Hopefully he can get the job done without more bogus tax cuts which will do nothing for the economy.  Doing nothing is not an option.

avcjtqGtaa	Clyburn is endemic of everything that is wrong with racial relations in this nation and interestingly enough narrow-minded bigots like artgurl are always there to defend the black man.  I've avoided bigots like her my entire life.  Growing up in one of the states Clyburn was talking about I found myself criticized and ridiculed far more often by close minded blacks than any of the whites I ever dealt with.  I guess the difference is I grew up with a father who cared and actually lived the message King shared.  <br>  <br>  Obama, Clyburn, and even the white princess should just come out and say that they hate king and want to raise Malcolm up as the way to live.  Personally though I really wish simple-minded liberal whites would just shut up and find another cause since it's nothing more than belittling bigotry every time they step up to the plate.  They gave me nothing.  I owe them nothing and I personally loathe each and every one of them.|`|OLCoFKQraa	I wasn't aware that opposing the stimulus was anti black, that would imply the bill is full of pro black set asides, and I'm not aware that there are any such set asides in the bill, but then it is 1000 pages or so, and I quite frankly have no idea what's in it, but to me the idea that opposing the bill is anti black just doesn't make sense to me, like I said, if opposing it is anti black, that suggests that the bill helps blacks disproportionately to whites, so what are we even talking about here?

AA11752525	Dear Janelle,<br>  <br>                   Compensation for wrongful conviction is set by the statutes of each state. Even in those states that allow compensation for wrongfully convicted, there are ways for states to avoid liability through settlement and release. <br>  <br>                     And in those cases where falsely imprisoned people are compensated, it IS NEVER FAIR NOR REASONABLE IN AMOUNT and often the responsible public law enforcement agencies and individuals go out of there way to claim the individuals are NOT INNOCENT merely non-convicted. These are people paid to convict others and who increase earnings by the number of convictions and the nastiness of the convicted crimes. <br>  <br>               These people going to admit making a mistake? It goes against all their consciousness and economic interests. In fact, these individuals believe citizens to be presumed guilty.<br>  <br>                 Such is the status of the criminal justice system.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No. Most just are allowed to leave the prison.|`|kAwvPp0zaa	No, none of them automatically gets money. They have to sue. They can only win if they can prove some misconduct by the police, prosecutor, etc. The goal of the justice system is to bring 'suspected' persons in front of a jury and let the jury decide. As long as the 'state' plays by the rules, they cannot be liable for what the jury decides. <br>  <br>  If every wrongfully convicted person got hundreds of thousands of dollars, that would intimidate prosecutors from bringing legitimate cases to court. <br>  <br>  It used to be the case that only one eyewitness identification was sufficient to convict. It has since been proven that eyewitnesses are wrong more than half of the time. It's the job of the defense atty to raise these doubts. <br>  <br>  Many convicted rapists have been proven innocent through DNA testing, which wasn't available at the time of conviction, based solely on the victim's identification. These victims truly believed what they were saying. So who do you sue? No one acted maliciously, so no one is liable.<br>  <br>  EDIT: As a side note, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that proof of innocence is not sufficient to overturn a conviction and death sentence. A death row inmate, who had exhausted his appeals showed, through DNA, that he did not rape and kill the woman that he was convicted of killing. The Texas Supreme Court ruled that he should still be executed because a jury had decided his case, and that was it. He won, of course, in the US Supreme Court, but Texas still wanted to execute him. Guess what color he was.|`|QP28lnQEaa	My friend spent 6 months in prison for armed robbery and he didn't even comit the crime!

n2oEhdZiaa	The National Guard doesn't mobilize and deploy individuals.  They would have to activate your entire unit and then the WORST they could do is chop your unit up and use you guys to augment six or seven other units.  It happens, especially in large scale mobilizations.  Anyway, your unit has been home probably less than two years... so I would say, expect a 1 year out warning order (i.e. a heads up saying you'll be mobilized in one year) at any time.  Until you hear that, you can pretty much make plans at home for the next year.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Not true...<br>  Know plenty of NG that were deployed in <br>  1's & 2's...<br>  <br>  2007 you are over Due for Deployment...<br>  Most NG Units are on their 2nd-3rd Deployments...|`|BIQrsl4paa	Unlike the Reserves, who can be deployed as individuals, the National Guard has to deploy in company size units. Therefore, it is not possible for you to be deployed as an individual, only as a member of your company.

I also happen to think that Bush owning the house and the senate was a recipe for disaster.  Changes in the market are trends, not overnight events.  Conservatives can't have it both ways.  Was it a "do nothing" congress the last two years or  not?  The Democrats had no say in any policies before they took control of congress two years ago and didn't have the votes to get anything done.  <br>  <br>  Also, you have to realize that Wall Street is a neurotic bunch of people who react to the most emotional circumstances.  For instance, after 9/11, there was no event that should have caused the markets to crash.  It was pure emotion.  So, I don't think you can base the health of the economy solely on what Wall Street puts up.  <br>  <br>  But you can base it off of unemployment numbers, inflation, consumer pricing, deficit spending, etc.  If you use those facts, I think your pictures changes a bit.|`|AA11086243	stock market goes up and down... it was up for a while in Oct.-Nov. in 2007 under the dems...<br>  <br>  which unemployment number are you looking at? 7.5? <br>  <br>  it was at an all time low when Bush took over? and it's pretty much been going up ever since...<br>  <br>  HOW ABOUT looking at the same numbers for the same period of time... instead of cherry picking 5 out of different things?<br>  <br>  like mortgage rates... and unemployment... and stock prices... and consumer spending....<br>  <br>  the FACT is... many of these have been going down since 2005....|`|db4KT8J8aa	I have studied the market for many years, and I do assure you that it is as nervous, irrational, and skittish as a foolish woman, given to the vapours.

The Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed by the 106th Congress and signed into law by Bill Clinton allowed the CDO's and derivatives to become exempted for state and national regulations. Then when the last administration attempted to strengthen those regulations and the regulations concerning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Democratic leadership in Congress were adamant that there were no problems. Just refer to the numerous hearings from 2003 through 2006 where Frank, Pelosi and Reid continuously state that there are no problems.<br>  And now the actions of the current administration are just going to compound and exasperate the current economic conditions,|`|tvNkizDraa	There's certainly plenty of blame to go around.  Some factors I haven't seen mentioned so far...<br>  1. When the Community Reinvestment Act was initiated, there were some protections in place as well against predatory lending practices. The Community Reinvestment Act has been around for about thirty years, so why the problem now? Deregulation.<br>  <br>  2. While a poor person might not be accustomed to the complexities of home buying and mortgage loans, the banks were. The banks used predatory lending practices to make loans that they KNEW were high risk. So they made the loans, bundled them and resold them to strip off their fees and pass on the risks.

Here is my answer.  The time to object to military action is before the troops are deployed.  If we think the government is making a mistake, we will fight tooth and nail to stop them. No question about that.<br>  <br>  However, once a vote is taken and the decision is made to deploy the troops into harm's way, all dissent must cease.  The reason is, further dissension will have a negative effect on our troops.  While they are in theater, laying their lives on the line for us, the only thing our enemies should hear from us at home is that we are united behind our troops 100% and will do everything we can to insure they are victorious in their mission.  <br>  <br>  That is our duty to our troops.  It helps maintain our troops morale and is very discouraging to our enemies.  Constant dissension here at home hurts our troops' morale and encourages out enemies to hold out longer.  This is the lesson of Vietnam.  Our troops won pretty much every battle but the enemy, encouraged by our dissension here at home simply held on until we lost heart.<br>  <br>  Once we send them into danger it is our duty to support the mission; not to encourage our enemies.<br>  <br>  *|`|TqS3vGXFaa	I don't ask that you support every military action the GOVERNMENT takes, but I do ask that you support our troops.

The instant pull out weakened our international ties to allies, put 1.6 million of the countries we were operating into concentration style camps and we left behind many American soldiers whom were prisoners themselves. Wow, sounds like something to really be proud of.<br>  Rather than act like the immature cry babies and selfish "want their way 5 year olds" they acted like, they should have taken the fight straight to legislators and left it with Washington...no our brave men. In the final annalysis, these men were honorable to do what they were ordered to do, they signed the paper and were abiding by the contract. One could argue that they needed help getting out of there legally and the liberals and self righteous in this country let them down by trying to hold them responsible for something the government did.<br>  Every war has a reason...it might not be a good one, you might not even be smart enough to understand why it has to be......and that's where the left faulters. None on the left has proven anything as to why the Iraq war shouldn't have happened. Sure, no WMD's were found, but every intell agency across the globe thought they had them, Saddam even told people he did. We know that he used chemical weapons on the Kurds, and had the capability of bio weapons. Not to mention it was an oppressed country, women treated as 2nd class citizens, and mass graves filled with the enemies of the Iraqie state or those that dared to protest or say something......then there were the terrorist training camps and support of terrorist organizations...even if Iraq itself could not be linked to the terrorists.<br>  So we are suppose to listen to some leftist ? some purist ? some liberal whine there was no reason to go to Iraq ? where's your proof ? Not your emotional BS, not your gut feeling, I doubt most of those that protested the war even knew anyone in it or what it was about. Do we all need a nuke going off in our back yard before we wake up ?<br>  Rubber stamping anything the Government does is a bad policy, look how corrupt they are in the budget, taxes and the economy just for starters. And everyone has a right to question, but if you have nothing more than your self righteousness , indignation or disagreeance....that's little to nothing when facing the realities of the countries needs or a safer tomorrow.|`|NJtFYQ96aa	For a politician to be in office, The majority would have had to vote them there because they trust them to make their decisions, Military action is part of those decisions, If you don't like them, vote against them, Just like I did Obama .

PqldUxR1aa	You will either have to go to small claims court or get a lawyer, the least expensive thing to do is go to small claims court, in most states you can get up to a maximum of $5,000 (depending on the state) with proof of loses. Judges usually wont grant you compensation for loss of work unless you were directly injured. but i would sue them for the sidewalk for sure!|`|ItFYVwlDaa	I would contact my home insurer and have them deal with it.|`|8gi5gfOsaa	Consult the public records in the Secretary of State's office in your jurisdiction and determine the type of organization they have formed by legal registration. In some instances insurance information may be included in those records. If not, contact your state's Office of Insurance and lodge a formal grievance and inquiry regarding their insurer. You should have documented your position in the matter by contacting an Officer of the corporation or company involved. State the facts as you believe them in your correspondence, retaining properly dated copies for your files. Another research avenue is local court records accessible by the public under freedom of information or sunshine laws. Many times, bad actors have been sued before and by reviewing a previous complaint you can determine the insurance coverage. Many states and municipalities now offer on line access to electronic court records for a nominal fee and there is a wealth of information to be gleaned by a keen researcher.<br>  <br>  Follow your initial letter with what is called a "Notice of Intent to Sue". Again retain for your records all copies of documents exchanged preserving a paper trail. You may wish to quantify your damages if you so desire, explaining that the cost of litigation would dwarf  the cost of the necessary repairs they hope to avoid by shirking their responsibilities. Indicate a willingness to go to arbitration in lieu of filing and prosecuting a lawsuit to recover damages, as the potential for settlement would probably exist. You still reserve the right to sue should arbitration fail to rectify the matter to your satisfaction, so long as you don't enter into a binding agreement.<br>  <br>  The trick is finding the Officer or Officers who share decision making responsibilities within this "bad actor" organization. They so far as you know, may be completely unaware of your predicament at this point in time. You are probably dealing with reprobates involved only in field level supervision or oversight of this delivery outfit.<br>  <br>  Should you gain no satisfaction at the conclusion of these efforts, then don't hesitate, litigate! Their organization, provided these miscreants you are interfacing with have a scintilla of what their potential liabilities represent as well as what their responsibilities are with regard to their conduct, should have already filed numerous memorandum and incident reports. That would include apprising their insurance carrier of potential claims arising from the incident at the heart of the matter.<br>  <br>  You will need to contact the Clerk of the Court which handles small claims to obtain a copy of the rules of the Court and thereby determine the criteria, proper forms and etc, you will need to present your case to the Judge. I wouldn't bother with small claims if they force you into litigation. Simply obtain your associate or supreme  court local rules and order a pro se litigation guide from Amazon or Biblio for assistance in drafting your complaint and making certain you present your pleadings in a manner that will avoid early dismissal by summary judgment of the Court. Demand a jury trial and prepare to start demanding discovery. At this point in the process, these imbeciles who are trying to avoid a 1000 dollar outlay will suddenly realize their insurance carrier is going to have to hire a law firm to respond and defend the suit to the tune of anywhere from 500 dollars to in excess of a 1000 dollars per billable hour. Just to develop an answer to your complaint could cost 10 to 15 times what they could have settled the initial claim for, without ever even beginning the discovery process.<br>  Now you will need to add punitive damages as well as compensatory damages to the original actual damages. Be forewarned you must commit to prosecuting your suit long before you file it. If you have assets and a Court later determines your suit was frivolous or baseless in fact, you could be hit with opposition legal fees. That is something you would avoid by arbitration or small claims routes to solution of your losses.<br>  <br>  I really can't see it going that far if you exercise due diligence in your effort to file a claim directly with their insurance indemnifier or other responsible and reasonable operatives and making certain they know you will follow through to assure you gain satisfaction.<br>  <br>  Another consideration, which you should check out, involves the statute of limitations which would be applied to your particular type of lawsuit. Most of these limitations can be discovered on the Internet at various pro se and self-help web sites. Sometimes, however, they may not be as cleanly defined as one would hope. Many court jurisdictions now offer guides and forms to assist pro se filers with access to the courts and the judicial process. A majority of the judges sitting out there will be very unfair as well as unfriendly to pro se filers. Occasionally you may find that rare bird who still gives a damn about justice, but I would submit it|`|bVROvLNSaa	Why not hire someone to fix the sidewalk?  <br>  What's the big deal?  <br>  How bad can it be?<br>  Puh-leez!

7e7cb48ca14510a1f4daeb63d56a4974aa	NO.|`|S0iqDSSPaa	Yes it should be. In the past politicians wouldn't touch the idea. As the older generation leaves that thinks it is evil it grows increasingly more popular. Current poles indicate a 46% support for legalization. It won't be long. It would certainly help the economy and I'm sure the tobacco farmers are already ready to start producing. I personally do not smoke it any more but let us be honest here. It isn't even listed in the top ten of dangerous drugs while cigs and booze are just about the main causes of illness later in life and are both in the top ten.|`|bwLv2USTaa	why the heck not?|`|fc9205d542b3f8b1281ff1f85cc2e6f9aa	YES!!!<br>  <br>  Especially for those that need if for medical purposes. Smoking pot has a similar effect as drinking alcohol, but alcohol is legal and weed is not.<br>  <br>  If they legalize it then the Government can tax it, regulate it, and sell it like liquor, and maybe we carve our way out of the recession...at least here in the USA. And drug dealers wouldn't be able to sell it, cause it would be available everywhere, which should stop some crime. Plus, people won't be taking up space in jail for having or smoking pot and that will make room for the  murderers, rapists etc. the real criminals.|`|OVUkamlpaa	You can't even spell marijuana, and the 19 people that agree with you didn't even notice. <br>  <br>  I guess that tells you why they call it "dope".|`|jBM7e88raa	of course...it's a natural weed|`|AA10237782	Does a bear dump in the woods|`|1CxcmMdiaa	I think so.

Then and only then should it be legal. Growing should probably be restricted to the Ozark Mountains of Missouri and Arkansas and the hill country formerly inhabited by the Shasta Indians in California and southern Oregon. Strict regulation must be in place and enforceable in order to prevent competitive interests such as Thai-Stick Weed producers and a heavy levy should be imposed on that Maui-Wowee stuff grown in the volcanic ash of Hawaii, not to mention the naturally developed rope standing throughout the Oaxacan region of Mexico. We want our children and grandchildren to have only the best.

To other Jews it is.|`|nSgo6oVGaa	First let me start by saying I grew up in inner city Detroit in a multinational, mixed race family and extended family.  I personally know what racism is because I experienced it first hand on many occasions, accept because my skin color happens to be white, people like to call it "Reverse Racism" as if somehow it makes it less ugly, hateful or hurtful to the person experiencing it, which I can assure you in no uncertain terms it does not.<br>  <br>  That being said, I believe that groups like the NAACP, Rainbow Push Coalition and the New Black Panther Party are nothing more than race profiteers who have contributed to the high level of poverty and hopelessness.  The black community is told that it's a white man's world and you can't get ahead.  Then if a black man gets ahead, he is a "Sellout" or an "Uncle Tom".  This is a very dangerous situation that has lead directly to huge numbers of blacks avoiding legitimate career paths for fear of being alienated by the black community.  It is groups like these that perpetuate the myth by sensationalizing the smallest examples of trumped up racism and in the case of Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Push Coalition they launch a boycott all the way up until the company writes a big fat check to Jesse Jackson and suddenly he moves on to the next company.<br>  <br>  I think another way these groups victimize the black community is through the promotion of so called "Afrocentric" names and "Ebonics" as an acceptable form of communication.  Let me ask you if you would hire a financial advisor names Shaniqua who said something like, "Yo, wees gunna takes your Benjamins and put it wit dis fly company that makes these crazy products and wees gunna makes you some mad money!"<br>  <br>  See what I mean?  Look I am not trying to "Whiten" anyone up...I am just pointing out the obvious, an "Afrocentric" name and poor english is going to limit your income ability greatly!  The fact is these organizations promote and encourage anti-social behavior and that can only get us to the point we are at today where huge percentages of blacks will do at least some time in prison.<br>  <br>  Until the majority of black men stand up and begin to value the family unit again and marry women before having children with them...the cycle will continue.|`|qaVyBXT0aa	Once a group like that is started you can't get rid of it b/c the president of the organization would have to say "we aren't needed, so I am firing myself."  That doesn't happen. I think a great example is the UN.  When you can get them to provide "troops" the troops end up engaging in criminal activities, and usually make the situation worse.  Yet, the UN keeps growing gets bigger, like a cancerous pile of crap.<br>  <br>  Government or private industry, bureaucracy never dies,|`|UKrSb081aa	The NAACP isn't needed because they are biased.

HJaVcUGwaa	The answer to your question is simple.  India respects the law, and will not violate international law.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Israel is a rogue state that has no respect for international law.  Israel is already in violation of 10's of UN resolutions and international court orders.  That is not counting the other 10's of potential UN resolutions that the US has vetoed.<br>  <br>  Israel believes it is above the law and can do whatever it wants without having to answer to any.  Israel is forgetting one thing however; such behavior can not go forever.  Other arrogant states have existed in the past in history, and they all do not exist any more.

Her mother has ALREADY stated that they are not capable of being there to raise the children.. the house is going into foreclosure, so unless someone provides a house, there is no where for "grandma" to move into. No one has the moral right to expect it is up to grandma, anyway. <br>  As for judging.. the process to get pregnant like this, is not covered by medicaid.. meaning, she had THOUSANDS of dollars to pay this dr, at the same time as taking food stamps. That means she is guilty of welfare fraud, by spending money to make more babies and not provide for the ones she has. <br>  Finally, the state DOES have the job to evaluate if any child is being endangered or neglected by actions of the parent.

That's what is wrong with this society now; people do stupid stuff then expect everybody else to have to take care of them instead of facing their own consequences. I earned the right to judge her when my tax money started paying her bills and raising her children.<br>   The media will not make her crazy; she invited all that attention on herself by dropping a litter like an animal. Besides, anybody who wants that many kids was already crazy.<br>  She can't move her grandmother in with her because her home is about to be foreclosed on as her mother is $23,000.00 behind on her mortgage (I saw that on CNN this morning). So unless her grandmother is going to live in the cardboard box with everybody else, she isn't coming. (What kind of idiot has eight MORE kids when they can't pay their mortgage? Where are the kids going to live? I don't know if that's disgustingly crazy, disgustingly selfish or both.)<br>  I think all these people who pop out insane numbers of children then jump in front of TV cameras are gross. That's just our reality show mentality these days, I guess. But if you want to help her so bad, don't let me stop you. Hand her all your money, open up your home to her and her two litters if you want. Encourage her to have more kids, then you can get a second job to feed them all and go broke doing it. But I resent any dime out of my hard-earned paycheck that is going toward irresponsible mothers like this one. And this one really takes the cake.|`|AA11313798	you know, honestly i didnt judge her at first...but you gotta look at it in this light..<br>  <br>  one issue is obviously on everyone's mind.. she's going to be using taxpayers money to pay for all those kids.<br>  <br>  but here's the real deal ok?<br>  <br>  yes yes we all like to say god bless her... but wait. is she really doing the kids a favor??<br>  <br>  if you are a parent, or know of good parenting, you know that raising a child is hard. she already had 6 kids, 3 of which had a disability. you know, as well as we all do.. that parenting is a lot of work. you need time to show a child u truely care for them. adequate care! tender love and care.. how do you divide this with 6 kids? and now 8 more?? <br>  <br>  Did she think of the children when she did this? or did she think of herself? Is that not selfish? All her kids would not get the kind of love a mother should be giving her child if she has to balance so many.<br>  <br>  And yet, she said she has a child psychology degree.. HOW ON EARTH...!!???<br>  <br>  And she also plans to go back to school? She should be working to support her kids.. and even while doing that, how does she watch her kids? Having lots of kids for grandma to watch isn't very fair to grandma. <br>  <br>  And none of this is very fair to the children either.<br>  <br>  You know, despite that we all hate how she takes advantage of gov't money....the main point is to think about the children. And you know very well... they will not get the adequate love and attention they all deserve for a healthy growth.|`|AA11657757	Well, the problems I have with her:<br>  She doesn't care if her kids have a father. She selfishly brought children into the world to fulfill her needs.<br>  She relies on the government and her parents to support her children.<br>  She chose to have 8 children, knowing that it could jeopardize the health of her kids. She doesn't care if one of her kids would have a disability. She would get disability paychecks from the Cali government.<br>  She has had plastic surgery. She's poor, and she's wasting money on her face.<br>  <br>  The woman who had 18 kids: that's weird, but she obviously takes care of them, they have two parents, and debt-free. Even though I would never do it, they did it, and managed to pull it off. Not octomom.|`|Cet7DXJ1aa	because she's unemployed and completely chose to have the eight embryos emplanted into her. She was super pro-life and now she's gonna have 8 unhealthy and stunted children to show for it. Its her fault and now she wants the rest of us to pay our money to get her out of it.<br>  <br>  PLUS- America loves to judge people... its kind of our thing ;)|`|kELDXjkgaa	Your assessment is fair, but I don't want to pay for her children.  I want to spend my time and money making sure I can afford my parents as they grow older, myself and possibly my own children one day.  Since I take that commitment very seriously, I would like others to do the same.|`|zmab07Giaa	i dont like her because she had the kids for the sole purpose of taking advantage of people, and i am happy because it has failed

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	I'm not sure what you are asking but if you are asking can someone who has your power of attorney sell your property the answer is "it depends on what the power of attorney says".<br>  <br>  The part about the purchaser being a non immigrant -- doesn't matter. Anyone can buy property in the US, whether or not they have a visa or permission to be here.<br>  <br>  If you give someone an essentially unlimited power of attorney you are giving them the power to do whatever you could do yourself. That means they could sell anything you own in most cases (some states won't let real estate be sold that way...but few exceptions exist like this).<br>  <br>  To avoid problems, a power of attorney should be limited to the specific matters you want the person to handle. For example "I appoint john jones to acts as my reprsentative with my power of attorney to do anything necessary to sell my 2002 Toyota Celica VIN number 123455667889" or "to rent an apartment for me and my children in the city of Chicago, Il or its suburbs".<br>  <br>  You should also make sure a POA is limited in time, which can depend on however long you expect to need it to be active, but not longer. "from this date forward but not after January 1, 2010" or "for a period of ninety days from the date of this POA". You can also revoke a POA if you think the appointee is going to do something you don't like, but you have to notify the appointee of the revocation, and it only takes effect when you have notified them.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you may need a real attorney to help you...|`|6JXrlnYsaa	The Power of Attorney is the document - you know, the PIECE OF PAPER - which gives some authority to the signer's REPRESENTATIVE or DESIGNEE.  <br>  <br>  The designee is NOT the "POA".<br>  The desginee HAS power of attorney.<br>  <br>  <br>  And the limits of that authority are defined in the document - you know, the POWER OF ATTORNEY.

4apYtDp7aa	hong kong is different from china in its visa standards and if you want to go there for more than 90 days (which you probably are) you will need a visa. You have to go to a chinese embassy and fill out forms there. It's not hard though because it has different laws than china and since it was ruled by britain until like 1999 a person of british origin (born in britain) could stay there for 6 months before needing to apply. You can go to the immigrant department near you if you have one. If you cant do any of the above go to the immigrant department website at here <a href="http://www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/hkvisas_4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immd.gov.hk/ehtml/hkvisas_4.h...</a> there might be some traditional chinese but its mostly in english so it shouldnt be a problem.|`|MVmYBDfKaa	American Airlines

hmA8nfA2aa	It depends on what you consider difficult. The steps to become a police officer vary depending on the state and the department. Visit the websites of the police departments that you are interested in. You will usually find detailed information about how to apply and about the hiring process. If a department's website does not answer all of your questions, simply call the department and ask to speak with a recruiter or someone that can answer your questions. Joining your town's junior academy is a great idea. Be a good person, maintain a good reputation, and don't do anything that you would not want a background investigator to find out about. Get good grades while high school. Establish some credit history. It doesn't have to be much, but just enough to indicate some financial responsibility. Try to obtain a college degree. A degree will benefit you greatly. Earning a college degree is one of the best things that you can do if you want to become a police officer. Establish a good work history. If you have a job, be a good employee. Be competent, reliable, responsible, courteous, etc. If you don't have one, get one even if it is only one day per week. Be physically fit. There are many things to consider when thinking about becoming a police officer. Check out <a href="http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com</a> for excellent information about becoming a police officer. Good luck!|`|fB4c9TCTaa	no ****.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	Yes.  Yes it is.  It can take from 6 months to 2 years to get hired on at some departments.  Here's the process at most departments:<br>  1.  Apply<br>  2.  Written test<br>  3.  Physical test<br>  4.  Oral board interview<br>  5.  Background check<br>  6.  Polygraph<br>  7.  Medical screen<br>  8.  Psych eval<br>  <br>  If I can give you some advice.  Get your degree first, in any subject you like, before applying.  If you can't afford school, go into the military and have them pay for it.  Military service (especially with a clearance) and a degree will do nothing but benefit you in the hiring process.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of people trying to get that job and there will always be someone better qualified then you.  You need to be the best applicant in more areas than someone else.   Keep out of trouble.  Stay away from drugs and a bad crowd (your background investigator will be contactind your friends, neighbors, family, teachers, bosses, coworkers). I was a police explorer when I was in high school and I learned so much from the officers.  Good luck!|`|hfDohxp5aa	One thing to keep in mind is that it is a HARD job because it is full of stress and politics !!|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	I agree with the first answer lolz|`|C4Ur8s5eaa	no, you just have to be really stupid and wish no one likes you. not even your friends|`|13wBSFe5aa	Pull up the website of your local PD and they should have information on how to apply.<br>  <br>  Some PD's have on-line applications, and some only hire during certain open periods..

If you did it and are looking at jail time upon conviction, that may be your only option.   But it haunts you on every job application, with disclosure to a future spouse, with entering the military, etc.   Sometimes laws are later enacted that make that crime registerable at a later date.   Think of someone who years ago had consensual sex with one underage and now must register as a sex offender.    Unless you had a violent or armed offense, I'd wonder about getting it reduced to a misdemeanor.|`|13wBSFe5aa	Since Lowe's is private (non-unionized) they can fire you for anything they want.<br>  <br>  If your supervisor wants to keep you though - even after telling them about the incident - who knows, they may appreciate the honesty and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Only you know your boss..

However, unless they are in violation of that, or noise ordinances, there's not too much you can do.  If you really have a problem, check out your local codes and see whether or not they are in violation of anything.  If not, then you'll just have to tolerate it.  Sorry I don't have better advice.

And, only $49.95 on pay per view.|`|AA11086243	I really don't agree with a "hey, that guy did a horrible thing, let's be horrible too by doing the same"...<br>  <br>  some people are monsters... <br>  <br>  turning into a monster to pay him back isn't healthy in my opinion...|`|a2c4e51c8fd856b28fad3a9af0b58041aa	Damn good question.

They should live by it.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	That's harsh, but I guarantee the next guy thinking about throwing acid in his wife's face will stop and consider :)
9VaWal2Daa	Yes I agree.   The guy sounds like a first rate moron. <br>  <br>  Ya wanna protest , that's one thing.   Riding around with a sign that sez "Abort Obama".........Yeah, he's lucky he's not getting an anal probe by the secret service right now, <br>  <br>  The officers were right.   If you are advocating "aborting" a grown person........that can only be construed one way....a direct threat. <br>  <br>  They were right to at least check it out, and question the guy. <br>  <br>  He can take his lawsuit and shove it.|`|dMeVhu0iaa	Yea, I live in the Northeast corner of the state and Obama did not carry one county out of 77 in this state. I had the only Obama sign in my neighborhood and 2 of my neighbors sort of secretly told me they were voting for Obama, lol  We do hear a different tune around hera when it comes to Obama. The only thing is, when something good comes around that the new administration does to help the area, you won't find anyone who didn't vote for him and they will all be at the trough with their bibs on.   go figure.|`|4V2Odsygaa	wow that must be tough,when you feel like it's just you against the world,yeah states like Oklahoma and texas Alabama,Mississippi are not very progressive and seem very obstinant and close minded.Be Strong,keep your head high,you will be rewarded.Yeah that sign would dampen my spirit too,just remember there is ignorance and hate behind that,but those who chose Obama walk in favor and in the light.|`|ySAT3sFraa	Are you sure that she was running from the hurricane?|`|1CidOxbyaa	closed minded is not the case at all. just because someone didn't vote for him doesn't mean that they are racist. they just saw through his lies and propaganda. people felt like they owed the blacks something so they voted for the black candidate, so in a sense you are the ones who were close minded.|`|CPJ9jDfgaa	Why would this make you ashamed of your state?  Freedom of expression is alive and well in Oklahoma. I would be more ashamed if the state tried to supress this man's freedom.  If it could be construed as a threat to Obama, let the secret service sort it out.|`|qcLP5j8zaa	I certainly understand the police concern because if Harrison wanted to oppose abortion the sign should have been about abortion period, I suspect there's more to Harrison's intent.|`|GWz5KDTwaa	I'm an Oklahoman and I agree.

Also there's the thought that he could attract votes for those who wanted to see a woman in the running.  There were so many more qualified people he could have chosen. |`|bxYWJAYNaa	He wanted a woman VP, and I guess he thought all the Republican women in Congress and the Senate were too frumpy.<br>  Yep, he's a man, and he's shallow.<br>  If we remember his history, he dumped his frumpy old wife, for a beautiful, younger millionaire heiress.<br>  Same pattern here.|`|NJTyv66Caa	He was thinking that all of the angry female Hillary followers were going to vote for him.  But I think had he picked Coni Rice, he actually would have had a chance.  Palin has given some of worst interviews I've ever seen.  I cringe.|`|uzTx5SSRaa	He wasn't thinking rationally - that's the problem. I honestly think he only picked her because she's a WOMAN. Nothing more, nothing less. <br>  <br>  What does she have to offer otherwise? Nothing. <br>  <br>  She will be impeached as Gov...Good! |`|AA11828439	No one knows!
JRFXt6O5aa	Ok Chuck ,if your MOS is critical they can pull you and use you as a filler in other units. Unless your unit is slated for deployment. Then you will probably go with them. I was on active duty as an adviser to a Reserve unit for a spell. AS A RESERVIST ITS NOT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ACTIVATED ITS WHEN.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Yeah... in the Reserves, they can pick any one person they want, pull them out of their unit, mobilize them, and dump them with any unit they want and send them to Iraq.  The Guard is slightly different in that they will mobilize, say eight units, they will chop 1 of those 8 units up and put those guys in the other seven units to max out their authorized strength.  It's extremely unlikely that they would mobilize you to active duty for the duration of your contract.  Everyone cycles in and out of one year mobilizations now and again.  Depending on when the unit you are joining most recently returned home, you can have a decent idea of when they may be deploying again.|`|Q8GFvklUaa	OK calm down, all that is VOLUNTARY!<br>  <br>  There are allot of people that volunteer to deploy and if their unit is not deploying they can be attached to a deploying unit. So yes a single person can be deployed if they volunteer to do so.<br>  <br>  Many a person in my unit have also volunteered to go active duty. They don't make you go (to my knowledge). But if you ask to go they sure as hell will send you, pending you have a good service history.

avcjtqGtaa	It's a distinct possibility at this point.  We have a president, house and senate who believe the original new deal was such a good idea (we are still paying for it after all) that we'd do it again.  We have fast food restaurants that are outsourcing their drive through windows (though I wonder how much they really save.)  We have organizations that are so dependent on keeping their constituency repressed they perpetuate racism and we have people who are so blindly guilt stricken by something that doesn't even play a part in today's society that they wallow in self-guilt while applauding themselves for their barely concealed bigotry.  <br>  <br>  So in short, and lets face it you really have to keep it short for some of these people:  Yes, we are rapidly sliding down that slope where we will be so dependent on others that we lose that which made us special.

This is still a capitalist society which offers the freedom of how a person does financially(which is why we are bailing out financial institutions,manufacturing,etc,) These corporations and individuals made some terrible decisions,which our leaders should have recognized before we got into the situation we are in,but did not. We are being advised by our current President and lawmakers what we need to do to get back on our feet. I do not like to see too much government intervention as i have a feeling neither do you,but something has to be done to bring irresponsible people to accountability for what they have done and to help responsible honest hard working people to keep from losing everything because of those who are irresponsible.

This has caused American products to become cost prohibitive to manufacture, leaving the imported products to be the better deal for your money.

This applies when Congress has the task of overriding the President's Veto Power or in the event of a filibuster in the Senate.<br>  <br>  A Simple Majority means more than 50%  it can be 51 votes out of 100.<br>  <br>  A Super Majority means in the case of overriding the President's Veto Power a 2/3 majority.  Meaning out of 90 votes, 60 would have to vote for the overriding of the veto.<br>  <br>  In the Senate, it refers to calling for cloture or an end to debate which requires at least 60 votes.  In the Senate 41 Senators can rise in opposition to a bill and prevent it form going to a vote.  Even if the Bill has the 51 votes needed to pass, if 60 people won't allow the vote to take place then the Bill cannot get passed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA10313141	A simple majority requires 50% of the votes in order to pass a measure, win a vote, etc.<br>  <br>  An absolute majority requires 50% of the total POTENTIAL VOTERS in order to win.<br>  <br>  So let's say you're voting in the Senate, which has 100 members, but only 70 are present that day.  It would take 36 votes (50%+1) to get a simple majority, but would take 51 (50% of the total senate +1) for an absolute majority.|`|Yby8HyYYaa	Blacks are wishing for either so gear up sister!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Simple: A majority of votes calculated based upon the number who  voted. <br>  <br>  Simply put: you count the votes and award the win to the choice that gets the most.<br>  <br>  <br>  Absolute: A majority of votes calculated based upon the number that could have been there to vote.* <br>  <br>  Simply put: you count the votes and award the win to the choice that gets more than half of the votes that could have been gotten, had everyone voted.<br>  <br>  * This ensures that important issues are not decided by too few (when attendance is down).<br>  <br>  Did I make it worse...?

But, I don't want any president trying to compare my life to that of Joe the Plumber in Ohio.  I am not Joe the Plumber.|`|Gr9gS0KUaa	Joe the plumber might potetially represent a small percentage of americans who border the rich and middle class.  He should be called Joe the entrepreneur.  But he's basically a plumber who wants to buy a business.  Mccain knew very well this man is the perfect example of someone who could possibly be negatively effected by Obama's proposed tax plan.  However, not only is he unlikely to generate 250k a year from a business that hes thinking of buying out for 250k total, but even if he did he would still be exempt from Obama's tax plan because it would still be considered a small businesses.  I think even Joe knows this to be true however he still has a dream and the dream seems a bit smaller under Obama's tax plan.  <br>  <br>  Joe the plumber probably doesn't want to have to vote for mccain but feels he needs to protect himself financially by doing so.  He will protect his unlikely deam and vote for mccain.  He didn't put in 12 hour days for all these years to give up now.|`|HnSOrJrQaa	Hell, I own my company and don't make $250,000/year.<br>  <br>  First of all, if you're paying an employee enough money to BUY your company then your company is doing something wrong. The more a business grows, the more it's worth. The more it's worth, the more you can pay your employees if deserved. I've never heard, "My company is growing enough that I will pay my employee enough to buy the company."<br>  <br>  Trust me Joe, if you can afford it on your hourly wages, you don't want it. But maybe I'm way off. I don't know his financial situation.|`|5xsvA7Y8aa	I'd say he is going to vote for McCain..... here is why: (off main page on yahoo after tonights debate)<br>  <br>  <br>  COLUMBUS, Ohio - Who is Joe the Plumber? <br>  <br>   <br>  He is Joe Wurzelbacher, an Ohio man looking to buy a plumbing business who came to symbolize the notion of "spreading the wealth" in Wednesday night's third and final presidential debate between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.<br>  <br>  Earlier this week, when Wurzelbacher got a chance to speak with Obama when the candidate visited Toledo, he told Obama that his tax plan would keep him from buying the business that currently employs him.<br>  <br>  Sensing an opening in the debate, McCain cited that exchange when the candidates were asked to explain why their economic plans are better than their opponent's. McCain said Obama's plan would stop entrepreneurs from investing in new small businesses and keep existing ones from growing.<br>  <br>  "Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes," McCain challenged Obama.<br>  <br>  "You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream," McCain said.<br>  <br>  McCain then looked directly into the TV camera and said: "Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees. And I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income."<br>  <br>  Obama denied that was true.<br>  <br>  "Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy," Obama said. "They produce the most jobs."<br>  <br>  So what did Wurzelbacher (pronounced whur-zell-BAHK-er) think about being at the center of the debate?<br>  <br>  "It's pretty surreal, man, my name being mentioned in a presidential campaign," he said minutes after hearing McCain utter his name.<br>  <br>  In Toledo on Sunday, Wurzelbacher told Obama that he was preparing the company, which earns more than $250,000 a year, and said: "Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?"<br>  <br>  Obama said that under his proposal taxes on any revenue from $250,000 on down would stay the same, but that amounts above that level would be subject to a 39 percent tax, instead of the current 36 percent rate.<br>  <br>  "And the reason why we're doing that is because 95 percent of small businesses make less than 250 (thousand). So what I want to do is give them a tax cut. I want to give all these folks who are bus drivers, teachers, auto workers who make less, I want to give them a tax cut," he said.<br>  <br>  Wurzelbacher protested, saying he's been a hardworking plumber for 15 years and why should he be taxed more.<br>  <br>  "It's not that I want to punish your success," Obama said. "I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you that they've got a chance at success, too."<br>  <br>  At a later point in the discussion, Obama said: "I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody. But listen, I respect what you do and I respect your question, and even if I don't get your vote, I'm still gonna be working hard on your behalf because small businesses are what creates jobs in this country and I want to encourage it."<br>  <br>  Wurzelbacher's name came up again when the debate turned to a discussion of health care policies. <br>  <br>  He said Obama's reaction on the tax question left him feeling uneasy. <br>  <br>  "I didn't think much of it the first time I heard it," Wurzelbacher said, adding that he still thinks Obama's plan would keep him from buying the business. <br>  <br>  About McCain: "He's got it right as far as I go." <br>  <br>  Even so, Wurzelbacher declined to say which candidate would get his vote on Nov. 4. <br>  <br>  "That's for me and a button to know," he said. <br>  <br>  |`|NBuDHALSaa	Does Joe know the housing market is crashing?<br>  <br>  My neighbor had a plumber make a service call last Saturday.  <br>  <br>  35 minutes and two welds later the bill was $315.<br>  <br>  Who can afford that?<br>  <br>  Ohio's unemployment rate is near 15%.

But, I have NO right to tell someone else what the best way to run their life is. I'm not living in their shoes and going through what they are. Your Catholic faith actually confirms what you believe. Personally you are against it, but you recognize the right to free will among others. You're right on track.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No,  it isn't hypocritical. You shouldn't try to legislate your own personal morality. This isn't a theocracy.|`|AA11963685	No, I see no hypocrisy in this.  You have exactly the right and correct feeling about this.  You follow your own religious beliefs, and would urge those the closest to you - such as your wife - to take those deep beliefs into consideration should the unthinkable situation happen.  But you do not believe that you have a right to impose your religious beliefs upon your neighbor.  That is truly the American way - no matter what religion you follow.  I believe most Americans feel the same way.|`|XuLVfj1caa	Your faith believes that complicity or allowing abortion is the same as getting one.  By aiding the process you've aided and abetted an abortion.  The Catholics believe that you have to fight against abortion and protect life despite the person's religion.  I don't think it's necessarily hypocritical, just not following the doctrine to the letter.|`|bA06K9INaa	Good for you. I always say that if you don't want one don't get one.|`|4DoXomHZaa	This is not about something, like say legalizing pot. In that case, it truly would be if you don't like it, don't do it, but if someone wants to be in their own home and do it, they truly are not affecting me in a detrimental way. Were not talking about tattoos, or blue hair, or smoking, or dring VW Beetles. <br>  <br>  Is the destruction of a unborn affecting me? Well, no....it wouldn't affect me if you came and murdered my next door neighbor either, but I still believe I can say to you you can't do that. It does affect me directly by affecting the society in which I live, which says, it is ok, if the results of your actions (anytime sex is had, protected or not, there is a chance) are inconvenient for you, to suck your unborn child into the sink.<br>  <br>  What of those who fought against slavery? Was that an I don't like it, but I can't stop you thing? Who am I to restrict them? It's legal after all? No. They tried to dehumanize slaves in an attempt to make their treatment "ok"...doesn't mean it was, doesn't mean they were not humans. <br>  <br>  IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF A HUMAN BEING, EVEN IF THAT HUMAN BEING IS NOT YOU.<br>  <br>  When sperm and egg meet, a *seperate* human organism with unique DNA is created. It is an entity to itself, regardless of the environment it is in, be it a womb, or a petri dish, regardless of it's developmental stage.  Something that will be human is always human. It is not something else up until the subjective time someone places for it *to become* a human. A tree is a tree from the moment the seed sprouts (conception as it were) till the time it dies. It isn't something else until it reaches a certain height and then becomes a tree. To destroy a seedling is to destroy a tree.<br>  <br>  Catholics, along with every other Christian religion believe "Thou shalt not kill". No, you should not go to abortion clinics and tackle people to stop them, but in the footsteps of Christ, you are supposed to help them come to the right path with peaceful reason and love. Right?<br>  <br>  Laws are based in large part on moral principles. Like killing, stealing, etc. Laws are the moral system of a society.|`|gQYIphZtaa	I think the whole issue is hypocritical,A baby is born then he is alive. The only way to prove otherwise is to use the exact science that most "Lifers" abhor and openly do not except. You can't have it both ways either you embrace science in all it's wonder or you reject it, you can't pick and choose.|`|yLpGPBEFaa	I don't think it's hypocritical.  Just because you feel that it's morally or spiritually wrong to do it, you are being understanding and open minded that your choices or opinions may not be right for everyone.  I wouldn't think that it's against your Catholic faith...it would be pretty sad if any religion made it ok to threaten other people just for not believing what they do.  Now THAT is hypocritical.|`|NWQZ8uh5aa	You're a terrible person and baby killer...<br>  <br>  But seriously...I often feel the same way with gay marriage. Though I have a moral disposition to it, I feel it's not my job to restrict it to others. <br>  With abortion, though, I believe if the fetus shows signs of mental growth and develops a functioning nervous system (i.e. the fetus can feel pain) then I believe it is another form of murder and, therefore, wrong to perform. <br>  BTW the fetus matures to these stages within two weeks time on average. Just thought I'd point that out...|`|siwxWxa0aa	No, because religion shouldn't play a part in the making of laws. I am against abortion for myself HOWEVER, I don't feel I have the right to take away another persons personal choice. <br>  <br>  <br>  I am Pro choice. I do not think the white house has anyplace in a woman's womb.|`|vgzfq2yKaa	Of course it's hypocritical...but honestly man, are you surprised.  If you open your eyes, you'll see that many of the right-wing Jesus-freaks are chock full of hypocrisy.|`|hiRYCT2Haa	Good for you, seriously. Just because you believe something doesn't make it right, let alone for EVERYBODY.<br>  <br>  It's always great when anyone thinks for themselves.|`|AA12020119	No it is not. People want to make their own medical decisions and their right under the US Constitution of liberty issues!<br>  <br>  I think the Catholic Church (Full of pedophiles they covered up for decades) should keep their religious nose out of state business. I am not Catholic and I don't give a you know what about what they think. Even they are not against abortion on moral grounds!<br>  <br>  I am not for abortion, but I am also not for making a decision for someone else that they will have to live with the rest of their lives. We have way over a 1,000 children a year, most under 1, murdered by their parents for the crime of crying!<br>  <br>  I think the ones who are walking in their shoes should have the decision, not someone who thinks life begins at conception and ends at birth! They are always ranting about women on "welfare"! Someone should tell them there is no such thing as welfare. Their is a TANIF program, but that is limited!|`|OfHoaWf7aa	If you want an honest opinion, your stance seems to be more pro-choice than pro-life (the direction Catholics should follow). You're saying you're against abortion yourself but you're willing to allow others to have access to an abortion if they choose. As a true Catholic, one must obey the law of the Church and God's commandments, one of which being "Thou shall not kill". We must respect God's creation, from conception until death. I find that a lot of Catholics nowadays are wishy-washy on this subject. I suggest you read the Catechism of the Catholic Church. You'll find your answer right there. God bless!

Complete incompetence can be shown over and over and the public is none the wiser because it's much easier to point fingers and assign blame; the bias media (on both sides) helps feed it and the public swallows it ; spending all their time feuding and complaining to one another instead of demanding more from their elected officials.<br>  <br>  Let's remember, we passed a bailout bill not long ago that was pushed by the Democratic side (with some agreement from the GOP side as well) and we were all told it had to be passed or we'd see a doom and gloom scenerio.

But let's forget that happened and redirect the public attention to something else... like a NEW plan that will definitely fix all our problems (hey.. haven't we heard that before?) that passed without anyone reading it <br>  <br>  Btw, a Democrat (OH) attempted to pass a bill years ago requiring a mandatory time span for reading bills before voting on them and the Democratic leadership never let it get to a vote.

Republicans controlled Congress for almost the entire 12 years prior to Democrats taking over with a very slim majority in 2007, and Republicans controlled the White House for 8 uninterrupted years prior to Obama's election.  Republicans are responsible for the enormous amount of debt that our country accumulated on their watch, they're responsible for the thousands of Americans who died needlessly in an unnecessary war in Iraq, and their political and economic philosophy is responsible for the current financial crisis that we're in.

sgEloO1Jaa	my recruiter bnever lied to me. <br>  <br>  yes your dog can live in base housing! <br>  <br>  he should be ok getting a regular security clearance as long as you tried to pay even a little bit of your debt. the smallest payment is better than nothing at all. he can however kiss a top secret clearance good bye. they dont let any of that stuff slide. i wouldnt claim bankruptcy. just stop using credit cards and the army can help him out with finances. good luck!|`|mr8isJoZaa	If you claim bankruptcy, tell your husband to pick a MOS that does not require any clearance.  It is imperative that you attempt to control your debt, or at least contact your lenders to arrange something, that will look positive for you.<br>  <br>  One big reason is that foreign nationals would look at you as a perfect target, they would approach you, offer you money in exchange for information, therefore a clearance is a scary situation to grant one who either by poor money management or poor economic times has found them in a situation to declare bankruptcy.  It's a risk that we can't afford in these times.|`|Q8GFvklUaa	Well the credit can be a problem depending on what kind of security Clarence he needs to get. <br>  You can have a dog on post, that's no problem if you live in post housing.

The only thing I can suggest looking out for is selecting the MOS (job) he wants and not letting someone convince him other wise. Good or bad if the Army is short in infantry, they might try and convince him to go infantry (for example).|`|ugE8qlVfaa	they lie about everything|`|qR4uLNH6aa	don't trust an army recruiter about anything that sounds too good to be true|`|sLEdPDkHaa	My job but he really did not lie, my credit messed up my security clearance so at the last minute i was forced to get a different MOS but it worked out for the best, well drilling is the most boring non combat MOS in the National Guard and i like that|`|ymNM6mmzaa	The dogs on base thing is fairly accurate, although it can be a pain to take a dog overseas.<br>  <br>  The security clearance issue is a little more troubling, but he may have a better feel for your situation than I'm getting from your email.  The recruiter doesn't make that call, he just submits the paperwork.  The Security Interviewer at MEPS will be able to give your husband a better idea about his eligibility for a clearance.

It's dangerous to the point that you're in combat arms. The enemy is looking to suppress our artillery fire and will aim for the cannons, so yeah, it has an element of danger (see counter battery fire). However, you're usually a bit farther behind enemy lines than infantry or scouts, so in that sense, it's less dangerous.<br>  <br>  However, the job in Iraq is the same for everyone. Just about every combat MOS does the same thing. Patrol and train. Train and patrol. Knock a few doors down too. It's all MP work. Same danger levels as everyone else.<br>  <br>  Look, if you want a safe job, become a dentist's assistant or go into aviation maintenance or something. They usually don't go into combat.
7113d2ecd54bd8e6d4704f58cb73decbaa	Dear Mr.Richard,<br>  You can apply under Tatkal .. no issues about that.<br>  <br>  In case if you are residing in more than one address in the last one year :<br>  you need to give details about the places where you resided and subsequent address proofs. You need to attach 2 personal particulars for each location. (There will be seperate police verification in each location)<br>  <br>  You will get passport in 5 - 7 days under tatkal but have you filled in your application? Because here in Chennai, it takes 35 days <br>  (30 days :: waiting time for submission of application; 5 - 7 days is the issue time). In case of normal applications it is 70 to 90 days.<br>  <br>  Very recently, I had applied for a passport and got it after much struggle. <br>  <br>  The best thing that I can suggest you is to visit the passport office once and enquire with the passport officer to avoid any future disappointments because a lot of things have changed over a period of time.<br>  <br>  For eg: In application form it is stated that you can produce 14 documents (any 3 of 14) as address proof but in reality they accept only 6 (3 out of 6). It is quite natural that a normal public will not be aware of all these and once when we submit our application they can coolly say it is "rejected".<br>  <br>  So, my suggestion is make a visit to the passport office at least once.

You should join to serve. That's it. If you do it for college money, for an "easy ride," for "free housing," or anything stupid like that, you are going to be very disappointed with it. You had a very unreal expectation of the military and didn't take advantage of things like Tuition Assistance or even just recreational learning. Pay attention in SEPS/TAPS much? Talk to the VA for help at all? <br>  <br>  <br>  "IMHO, it really freaking sucks that I have to wait an entire YEAR before the federal government is finally going to honor its promise that they will honor their word and pay for our (veterans) college."<br>  What on earth are you talking about? I guess you might be talking about the NEW G.I. Bill, but the old one is in effect right now if you want to take advantage of it. Where did you get this crazy information? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think your problem is that you relied on the military, an institution of service, to give you life experience for the civilian world. This is all on you, my friend. Even if you stayed a civilian, would you blame, say, McDonald's if you worked there 8 years and then realized you didn't want to do it anymore and had no real job skills to show for it? If you weren't doing internships and shadow learning or applying yourself, would you blame your college/university for not helping you get a job?<br>  <br>  In anything you do, strive to better yourself. You can't blame other people for not helping you achieve your goals. Once you put the responsibility in your hands, you'll be able to move on much quicker than if you constantly blame something. It's like a fat person who blames "addiction" or "genetics" for their weight, instead of their overeating and lack of activity. |`|vD7HquRgaa	"I am just bitter because I feel that the Marine Corps has hindered me in more ways than it has helped me, That's all."<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you feel that way.

The Marine Corps is the best thing I could have ever hoped for. <br>  <br>  You should have taken advantage of the opportunities offered to you. Had you taken college courses at night, the Corps would have relieved you of extra duty, helped you qualify for college courses, and paid the entire cost.<br>  <br>  Don't blame the Corps because you weren't a good Marine and took the easy way out.<br>  <br>  |`|rTBP0Ih0aa	How does the saying go, Nobody promised you a Rose garden???

JDltTREfaa	I wouldn't write up that kind of an agreement and I don't know that it would be enforceable anyway.  Child support is the right of the child - not the custodial parent.  The parents can work out an agreement and as long as it works for the two of them, everything will be fine.  But simply buying items for the child wouldn't be acceptable to any judge I've ever been before.  Some judges get pretty grumpy when a parent tries to argue that s/he bought things for the child as a reason they were not simply giving the custodial parent money.|`|AA11752525	NO LAWYER CAN, WILL OR SHOULD DO THIS. Totally an unenforceable contract without the slightest chance of being enforced if ever presented in Court.<br>  <br>                   Why?  First, the right to child support belongs to the Child. Second, the State will represent the Child so long as the child is under 18 years of age.  Mothers/Fathers  rights are less than the child's rights.<br>  <br>                    I agree that a DNA test is critical. If he obtains custody of the child which is doubtful, He can arrange for the payment of child support through the court without communications and contact with the Mother. At some point in this arrangement expect the Mother to change her mind and plans several times and further insist upon visitation rights. Does not matter how well you can take care of your grandchild. COURTS BELIEVE TWO PARENTS ARE ALWAYS BETTER THAN ONE.<br>  <br>            Lots of moving parts and much is going on. One step at a time. Is it truly your son's child? What role(s) does the Mother want to have in her child's life? What does your son want. What is best for your possible grandchild.

If he wants to take care of the baby and share custody of the child with the mother thats up to him but he wouldnt have to pay child support unless he is the biological father or adopts the child. HOWEVER if he is proven to be the father and get sole custody of the child the mother will have to pay child support. but thats really all going to depend on the test and the court system. even if he puts his name on the birth certificate that doesnt make him the biological father, so that makes him liable for nothing financially.

I have to pay for the eye exam, pay for the presciption, and then pay for the contacts! It's ridiculous, but my insurance won't cover anyone else...|`|eulMjLtPaa	It's really no different than a dentist charging to give you your dental x-rays so you can go to another dentist.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I don't see it being illegal. <br>  Turn it around, and the charge is such and such.. but if you buy the lenses from him, you get a discount. That would be a logical way to promote business for him, which is rational.. he is there to make a living/ profit. <br>  Is it nicer to give you the prescription, so you can fill it anywhere you choose? Sure. I don't see that he is legally obligated to make things less expensive for you. He is not OBLIGATING you to buy from him, but offering a different price, if you do so. <br>  It would be nice if there were laws about making things less expensive.. but the fact is, that it is a free market economy.

Some eye doctors charge less for the exam if you sign a contract to buy contacts from them. Get a copy of everything that you signed (they have to provide all medical records for pennies a page). Ask them for the paper that states what they claim. If they didn't have you sign a contract (any paper) that states what they are claiming, then they have to give you a written copy for free. It all depends on what you signed.
m6C3pgChaa	Take lots of pictures of the baby to keep him updated on what's going on back at home.|`|zSABr7praa	My husband is leaving 3 weeks after our first daughter is due.  It's not going to be fun, or easy, but we'll survive like we've done before, and just like you'll do.<br>  <br>  When my husbands deployed, I try to keep myself as busy as humanly possible.  To an outsider, it may look like I don't have time to think or breath, but it's what I need to do to make the time go by faster, and keep my mind occupied.  Last time, I got myself into a strict routine after about a week of sulking around in my pajamas feeling sorry for myself.  Wake up, take the dog for a walk, make breakfast, go to work, come home, walk the dog again, plans with friends or another activity, tv, bed.  Hopefully somewhere in there I would get a phone call from him, but I wasn't sitting by the phone all day waiting, that was too hard and made the time go by too slow.  I also started picking up more shifts at work, and taking hobby classes at the local community college.  I learned that I LOVE painting by taking a silly class that another wife had suggested to me.  She told me "do things you don't want to do", and it's funny, I didn't want to do anything, so that really helped.<br>  <br>  With a baby, you're a little bit more limited, but not by too much.  You still need to take time for yourself.  Find a military wife with a child that you can "baby sit swap" with.  Once or twice a week, do something you don't want to do, and hand your baby over to the wife or couple.  Next week, they'll give you their child so they can have a night out.  If you're sitting there thinking "...I don't know anyone with kids..." MEET SOME!  Military wives are the strongest, most supportive women there are, you need to connect with them.  <br>  <br>  The busier, the better.  He'll be home before you new it.

Just keep busy... with anything. Crying won't help I know it's hard but it honestly makes it worse. You definitely need to eat at least try. Also the sleeping I don't know what to say about that I still a year later can't sleep all the way through the night without my husband. It's tough... but when he enlisted so did you! It will get better with time! I even moved back home with my family the first four months my husband was gone. Now I am getting into a routine...

You have a small baby and you have too much time on your hands???<br>  <br>  If that's the case, I'd suggest that you get a job. Helping your family's economic condition is never a bad thing, especially in this economy. I would also suggest talking to the family support group/center on base. See if they can help you. Maybe give you some support duties to help other wives of deployed members. You'll find you're not the only one in this situation and you might end up getting useful advice and help from others that way.<br>  <br>  The other thing is to question yourself why exactly you're crying. Are you crying because you're afraid for his safety? Are you crying because you're afraid about how you'll do as a mother by yourself? Are you crying because of self-pity? Just figure out why you're crying and see if that's really a good reason to cry. Are things really THAT bad? Is it good to cry in front of your child and others? Does that set a good tone for the future? You have to be mindful of those things. It's your life after all. Everything you do today shapes your future. Your husband has it easy. His days are planned out for him. All he has to do is his job and that's clearly spelled out. It's tougher for you, but that's no reason to cry. That's life for most people out there.|`|tn7uM989aa	I know that you probably have a lot to do during the day with your little baby and all (by the way congrats!) but i know what you mean about this whole anxiety situation. When the baby is sleeping or occupied, take some time for yourself. Start creating like a scrap book or something. i know that when my husband left for basic (3 weeks ago) i had an extremely hard time. we have a one year old, who keeps me busy, but at the same time, it gets lonely when he is sleeping. Try making something for him for when he gets back. i think that he would really like something that you spent hours making and putting together. the scrap book could be of your little baby and him, or of you and the baby while he was gone--so he wouldnt miss anything. it also helps to keep a journal. write down your feelings or just even what you and your baby did during the day. That will help not only yourself, but your husband can read it when he returns or if you can send it to him. Whatever you decide to do, just make sure that you take some time for yourself to either cry and let it out every once in a while, or just watch a movie. If you need anything else, you are more then welcome to email me. Its always nice to have a friend! :)
4xn4a1yDaa	The Monroe Doctrine is a United States policy introduced on December 2, 1823, which said that further efforts by European governments to colonize land or interfere with states in the Americas would be viewed by the United States as acts of aggression requiring U.S. intervention. Its primary objective was to free the newly independent colonies of Latin America from European intervention and control. The doctrine advocated that the New World and the Old World were to remain distinctly separate spheres of influence, for they were comprised of entirely separate and independent nations.<br>  There were events when this doctrine was not employed, such as when France occupied Mexico.|`|35BLOIgOaa	hi there <br>  call me naive but all that document is the american government has a right to interfere with an Other sovereign country's affair's with out there permission<br>  and not Other european country's out just great britain is this document still valid ? today just asking is that way american force's invaded granada [point taken] when I went to school it was called gun boat policies nothing to be proud or crowed about that a law still stand 's on you statute book's giving you the right to invade basically any country in the world makes you think hey <br>  I am very Curious is it still an active bill ? here's one for you if and it's just IF the u.k and canada fell out in the past say just after the civil war would the state's have automatically involved it's self in that something to think about hey would make a good group discussion it would go on for ever<br>  all the best aly mac|`|UjXQriuKaa	to assert authority in the western hemisphere

It's not just persecution. There's no smoke without fire." It also featured footage of visitors to the party's annual "Red White and Blue" festival, some of whom wore the legend "88" (code for HH, "Heil Hitler"). Collett resigned from the party after the documentary's filming, but rejoined shortly afterwards, with Nick Griffin's approval, on the condition that Collett changed his views on the subject.<br>  <br>  In 2006, the party's deputy chairman Scott McLean was shown on the TV documentary "Nazi Hate Rock" making Hitler salutes at a white-supremacist cross-burning ceremony where intensely racist songs were sung and jokes made about Auschwitz ."

3yrpDNavaa	Keep in mind that "states rights" isn't about giving States more rights, but is really about limiting Congressional power.  The less power Congress has, the more power States have.  Congress justified the passage of many laws by citing its Constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce (the "Commerce Clause").  Up until very recently, the Supreme Court upheld every law that was challenged as exceeding Congress' Commerce Clause powers.<br>  <br>  <br>  United States v. Lopez (1995):  In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was unconstitutional.  The SC ruled that the Act was beyond Congress' power under the Constitution's Commerce Clause.  This case is considered the first time since the early 1900's that the SC seriously limited Congress' powers to regulate interstate commerce.<br>  <br>  United States v. Morrison (2000):  In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Violence Against Women Act of 1994 was unconstitutional.  The Act gave rape victims ability to sue their attackers in Federal court.  The SC stated that the Act was beyond Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause.  The SC stated that enforcement of local crimes, and vindication of victims, is a local issue.<br>  <br>  You can find more information about these cases at Findlaw.com or by doing a Google search.|`|rz9R4CMfaa	none
66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	It is not about respecting the rights of people who kill innocent people everyday with no regard to life whatsoever, it is about protecting the international image of this country that has been built over several decades of hard work.  America is powerful, and after the fall of the Soviet Union far more powerful than any other nation in the world, but despite this fact we are not invincible and we do need friends in this world.  A lot rides on America having a social model and foreign policy that is attractive to the world.  <br>  <br>  You presented a question that demonstrates to me that it is you who is in la la land.  Terrorists have no hope in hell of capturing control of any nation in the world, and it is fantasy to believe otherwise.  Islamic fundamentalism, or whatever you want to call it, is trumped up to be like the two deadly ideologies of the 20th century, both of which posed a mortal threat to the U.S., fascism and communism.  However, what made fascism and communism so deadly was not the ideologies themselves but was the fact that they captured control of strong industrialized nations (Germany, Japan, Italy, and Russia) that had the financial ability to raise large armies.  21st century Islamic fundamentalism cannot capture control of a country that could challenge even the regional interests of the United States, let alone our international primacy around the world, and it is a dream to think that they could ever invade and take us over.  That ideology had been tried and for the most part failed in places like Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.  The political belief structure that people like Osama Bin Laden encourage cannot produce enough dedicated believers on a large enough scale that their ranks could be successfully replenished at the rate that they are killed.  They are, and are destined to always be, those raggedy *** morons who video tape themselves killing other people that are trumped up by the media and the fears that 9/11 ingrained in us and that our politicians so IMMORALLY capitalized off of, and nothing more.  The war on terrorism will be won not by the use of major military force, but by rigorously difficult international intelligence gathering and law enforcement efforts, and indeed the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the various agencies that work under it have accomplished more victories than the entire war in Iraq has.<br>  <br>  The real danger posed to America is that by over reacting to 9/11 by “nation building” or “spreading democracy” or “fighting evil” in a campaigned with strong similarities (albeit ultimately different) to the imperial struggles of the past by Europe is that America encourages more terrorism against it, and must face this new reality against the backdrop of a world that no longer holds America in high regard; and that is a far more dangerous place to be than 9/11 ever was.|`|sGWljYFUaa	So what you are saying is that we must always lower ourselves to the level of our opponent rather than bring him up to our level. <br>  <br>  And now a quote from one of your obvious heroes based on your logic and what you say in your post:<br>  <br>  "Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger." <br>  -- Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials <br>  <br>  Have a great day.|`|5f7870fbdb7c8782dc6d264406cfb742aa	Well we aren't using moral and fair currently and those techniques aren't working.|`|JfDtOvJAaa	The only thing we have to fear is our Government, they are the terrorist, lead by President Satan, and puppet master Cheney.

As in, almost all of them. So Fox may be biased, but to think that CNN and MSNBC, etc are not is ridiculous. Wake up and be objective enough to distance yourself from your party a little bit and see things for what they really are. Every poll on Fox showed Palin won, just as every poll on CNN showed that Biden won. No, its not because he or she did, it's because their audience is predominantly from one side of the political spectrum or the other. Think about it rather than assuming that everything you read or are told is true. |`|zkhXlXI8aa	Palin took Biden's own words AGAINST Obama and wiped his face in it.<br>  <br>  She then brought up Obama's own words that we are "bombing villages"...<br>  <br>  <br>  The republicans got a CLEAN victory last night, and no matter how "polished" Joe Biden tried to be.... he was DEFENSELESS.|`|tkX8VMDSaa	Which news are you watching ?<br>  Biden won my a wide margin.

It was more like a sales presentation with each potential provider saying a few things about their "offerings".<br>  <br>  (Supposedly the McCain campaign insisted on this because they didn't think Palin could hold her own in a real debate.)<br>  <br>  Since it wasn't an actual debate it didn't really have a winner per se.|`|d7fXJGWvaa	it wasn't even close!<br>  Biden Killed her in every topic!<br>  <br>  palin actually didn't answer the question she just danced around them!<br>  <br>  palin did better the expected, because she memorized a few facts but she still did really bad!<br>  <br>  biden's answers where well thought out, and just all around better then hers.|`|WhPZQWMVaa	I believe biden won. but thats just my point of view.

A8nIdWe7aa	yes<br>  <br>  on the 4th was the primary election and on the 29th the district delegates come together again at the precincts and pledge the caucus delegates.<br>  <br>  Obama will come out ahead by 5 delegates approximately in Texas|`|4db4e56392492424b7d32a3addcaa645aa	Correct. To vote in the caucuses, you must first vote in the primary.  That's the " Two Step".  Texas has over 8000 caucuses.  March 29, precinct delegates will formally award those caucus delegates.  Obama is the projected winner.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	“The precinct conventions cannot start sooner than 7:15 p.m., and they also cannot start before the last person in line at 7 p.m. has had a chance to vote,” he said.<br>  <br>  At the caucus, voters sign in and state who their presidential preference is. That will determine which candidate gets the majority of delegates allotted to your precinct location. <br>  <br>  Under that system, two-thirds of Texas delegates are allocated according to the primary results, and one-third are awarded based on the caucus.|`|TeL3EzZkaa	We voted on March 4th in the primary. After the last person voted, the precinct convention started. We signed in and pledged our vote to a candidate. Then people were chosen (based on the pledged votes) to represent our precincts wishes at the county convention. Then those votes represented more representatives were chosen to go to the state convention. Then in June, the Democratic Party holds the state convention and all the representatives elect the actual unpledged delegates to attend the National Convention in August. It's confusing...
70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	That's because the true, "drug cartels," are foreign. Most operate out of Latin America and Mexico, Central America and Columbia, Afghanistan and South Asia. There are no established, "cartels," in the US. But there are countless arrests made here in the US of their members as well as other drug dealers in general. I'm not sure what you are assuming a cartel is?|`|WrDGhduxaa	There have been lots of arrests of U.S. citizens involved in drug rings. The definition of a cartel is different than a drug ring.<br>  Without getting into semantics you could say a major drug distribution ring is a cartel so then many U.S. citizens have been arrested.<br>  A cartel is thought to be involved in the processing and transportation of drugs, and those groups are not located in the U.S. and are managed by citizens of other countries, usually based in the country of production.<br>  |`|YT78CpfEaa	Probably because the cartel leaders don't live in the U.S, as their drug laws are too harsh and they value their freedom too much.<br>  Secondly, they are very well insulated from being caught, corrupt police and Govt officials, lawyers that sell themselves out to corruption and become lawyers for drug dealers. If you look at the ratio of drug distribution to what is made locally, cartel heads generally live in or around South American area's. Local manufacture of ecstasy and ice is usually controlled by outlaw bikie gangs, Hells Angels, Bandidos, etc.<br>

I think its sad they have to lie to people in order for them to make an honest living!|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Slight billing irregularities are not cause for cancellation of the contract, no.<br>  <br>  They do need to adjust the payments if they are incorrect.  Are you sure there are not other charges on there (taxes come to mind) that you haven't thought of?  You do need to inform them the amount is wrong, of course. most contracts such as this give you a limited time to dispute the bill.|`|hbPCrWd0aa	If I were you, I would talk to the people who run the gym, they should be able to explain the inconsistant charges. By law, when you signed the contract, both you and the gym agreed to certain things and now that the gym is not adhering to the origional perameters the contract is void. There for, if the gym voids the contract you are no longer responsible for maintaining your membership.|`|7Y1KIZ2Baa	Has the gym corrected each of these problems after you informed them of the errors? If so, I doubt that you have much legal standing to cancel the contract. If you want to try to cancel anyway, PUT IT WRITING! Make sure that a manager signs something acknowledging that they know that you want to cancel. They will likely refuse to honor your cancellation. If you pay by credit card, they will bill you anyway and then you will need to challenage the charge thru your credit card.|`|syW4jG7haa	yes

And Mccain would be just another Bush.<br>  <br>  Although my vote is for Obama, I think it will be tough for him due to the racist society in the U.S. against african americans which would lead to horrible death threats towards Obama and his family by vicious people who dont deserve to live in the U.S. But in my opinion, he seems like he can change this country.|`|fvN18yvGaa	By the time I retire a Ford Focus will be about $60,000, gas , $21 a gallon, health care, $10,000 a month the median price for a home in the US, $500,000 and my 401k will be morphed and disguised as my social security and wont be enuff to feed my cats...so at 83 just b4 retirement I plan on takin a left off of the Walt Whitman bridge.

oRMJcPoTaa	In the US, nonprofits are allowed to have fundraisers.  Also, they have limited rights to carry on businesses related to their tax exempt function.  Churches run thrift stores and bookstores for example.<br>  <br>  A nonprofit that runs a regular business that is not related to its tax exempt activities will be taxed on that income.<br>  <br>  So, if the church decides to go into the business of running these seminars all the time, it will end up paying tax on that.<br>  <br>  And if the income from the seminars is greater than the donations and other money the church receives from activities directly related to being a church, the church can lose its tax exempt status completely.<br>  |`|dAbAKLcTaa	It's not, just look at scientology.|`|XfdcoVmvaa	No-  the definition of non-profit, is that no one person profits from any income.  Many church buildings are used for many purposes and rented out for meeting space.  This helps pay for upkeep and to further the mission of the church.<br>  <br>  The pastor is only a employee of the church.  It might be immoral or a conflict of interest but it is not illegal for a pastor to have another job or business. |`|2679c96ea1cf96a21a907fa7e7c0a403aa	WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE MAKING JUDGMENT, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ANY MONEY THAT IS LEFT OVER AFTER PAYING THE COSTS, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION.

He's doing what he thinks will benefit the greatest number of people in the most significant way. That is exactly what his job description is.<br>  <br>  He's not perfect. I didn't expect him to be. But when he f*cks up at least he can admit it. Bush took us to war with insufficient troops and funds, wrecked our economy, and divided our nation. And he never once admitted that he made a mistake.<br>  <br>  Presidents are people. I don't expect them to never make mistakes. But I expect them to own up to it when they do, and do everything they can to fix it. Obama does. And I'm more than pleased with that.<br>  <br>  He's inhereted a really bad situation from Bush.

A video posted on Stanford Financial Groups  web-site shows Stanford being hugged by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and praised by former President Bill Clinton for helping to finance a convention-related forum and party put on by the National Democratic Institute.

But the parts I read were excluded from what you placed for all to read.  If preparing the government to handle domestic security was wrong, do enlighten us.  It appears to me our government officials were taking the necessary steps to ensure that should something happen in case of an attack of monumental proportions that there was a contingency plan in place.  <br>  <br>  It seems they were bringing laws and security programs up to date that were over 20 years old.  If there someone that is against NORTHCOM protecting us by reading and interpreting terrorist chatter?  Is there something wrong with Northcom watching for missiles or nukes that could be headed our way?  Was there something wrong with having a contingency plan to handle the government should something like the plane that hit the Pentagon on 9/11 instead hit the White House?  <br>  <br>  I believe that Obama's ideas of a Civilian National Security Force are of more concern.  If we're going to create some kind of national police force as big, powerful and well-funded as our combined U.S. military forces, isn't this rather a big deal?   If we do have an army preparing for the worst catastrophes, plus we have national guard troops and police departments...why do we need a Civilian National Security Force?"...interesting use of words, "Force."<br>  <br>  I thought these paragraphs were more important and were not cited.  <br>  <br>  "Continuity of Government" (COG) Provisions activated in 2001 <br>  <br>  "After 9/11, new martial law plans began to surface similar to those of FEMA in the 1980s. In January 2002 the Pentagon submitted a proposal for deploying troops on American streets. One month later John Brinkerhoff, the author of the 1982 FEMA memo, published an article arguing for the legality of using U.S. troops for purposes of domestic security."<br>  <br>  "Defense Secretary Rumsfeld called NORTHCOM's launch "the most sweeping set of changes since the unified command system was set up in 1946."<br>  <br>  "They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive, or CBRNE, attack. ..."<br>  <br>  "One goal of the exercise is to exercise with partners from the civilian agencies they would support. To that end, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other interagency representatives are participating to ensure integration with civilian consequence managers who would lead a response, said Vogler."<br>  <br>  Most can read between the lines, and you are in charge of deciding and pulling out information based on your thoughts, bias and leanings.<br>  I chose to see what I believe was the real intent for updating the laws.  President Bush has always protected our nation and still is today.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, Obama's radical friendships, make me believe his agenda is quite different than President Bush's.  I believe that Obama's ideas of a Civilian National Security Force are of greater concern.  I find it peculiar that he also wants to create all these "corps" ...indocrination of children?  Volunteerism will be replaced by "Mandatory" community service.  Will he use the laws enacted to protect us in an adverse way.<br>  I pray that our government has the safeguards in place that any subversive ideas can't and won't have the ability to sabotage our way of life. <br>  <br>  You read the articles one way and I read them another.  But there isn't anyone that can convince me that President Bush had any suspect motives for what they did nor any intentions for bringing harm to our country.  Personally, I resent anyone who thinks otherwise.   Those that do present such views aren't American's that I choose to listen to or follow.  They don't present our country's reasoning in the best light, they choose instead to spread and fuel their own sinister views and one must wonder why.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, Bush hasn't implemented Marshall Law as your statement infers.

Bush manipulated oil prices, but they were the highest they've ever been when he was the President, and therefore legally prohibited from profiting from oil prices.  I don't see it.<br>  <br>  After all Bush was genius enough (by some accounts) to plan and execute the 9/11 terrorist attacks and keep millions of people quiet.  Surely someone with that kind of intellect would have the sense to keep prices high until he could profit.
zC7kuMLsaa	in my personal opinion i belive that women should not be allowed to operate on the front lines. Im not sexist at all, i belive that women should be kept from harm as they have the capabilities to reproduce, live longer and are not as naturally equipped as a male for such enviroments and situations. <br>  <br>  Men have always been in the army, women operating next to them in front line combat could be a complete distraction and lead to rash and in mens eyes (heroic), sacrifices. <br>  <br>  There is a reason why men are built muscley and why women are built with wombs, as sexist as that sounds its nature, credit to the women of the second world war who understood this but contributed to the war effort in other ways, and to the modern women in the military who serve behind front lines!|`|a8f1f15273640c6a589fc8f62359c669aa	In this society, women are taught they can do anything. Since they have the freedoms that men have, women have a natural need to be considered as equals. This gives them the urge to go on the front lines, since they are considered to be the weaker gender. They want to prove themselves.<br>  P.S.- the best of luck to you :)|`|mm5p5sy6aa	Women can't have combat MOS<br>  Men can't be Hooter's waiters.<br>  <br>  If we can protect our women from direct combat and protect ourselves from men in those shorts I can sleep a happy man.|`|yKLBdoigaa	Men have a lot harder time seeing a woman die next to them, than having a man die next to them, apparently.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	in my opinion there is always that one girl that can handle combat and they are called female navy eod techs(only eod that is special operations)<br>  <br>  But it does any me how some females say the whole we can do what ever you can and then I ask them to do a pull up and they cant. They then do the whole thing that men naturally have upper body strength and women have lower body strength. That theory is bs though because ive seen moms that can do 5 dead hang pull ups and girls who's leg have the circumference of my arm. Its all about how you live your daily life and how you condition yourself. <br>  <br>  Men are not naturally born with more or less strength than women but they are born with hormones that gives them a mental state that leads to them being stronger|`|tDZMJue9aa	why are you trying to make other women and their fight mean less..if you expect to be treated as the weaker sex..thats all you will get in return..i didnt need to join the military to know that there is nothing weak about me....did you<br>  <br>  <br>  lift? depends on what it is....i can lift my son off the floor he is 180 lbs and i can carry  him around...i can also put him on hte floor...and im 5 foot 5 while he is 6 foot 2 and by no means weak..im not military my husband is active duty air force...your question and no offense meant sounds as though you are demeaning women by agreeing with they are the weaker sex..and its simply  not the case...could i do infantry yes i think i could, do i want too..no im not a tomboy but i do believe that if other women want to be able to do that job they should have the option like a man they either cut it or they dont|`|s5lj3ENhaa	I agree with you...there are some things that women should just not do and Combat Arms is one of them....I obviously am not in the military I am just a lowly wife but I have put on my husbands "battle rattle" in an excercise that was for the wives and that crap is heavy....Congratulations on enlisting and Good Luck!!|`|s0UUQYZQaa	id have to agree with ya on that, because dont get me wrong, i love women,...,lol, but the just dont have the physical strength that men have which they may and most likly will need on the frontlines..|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Good luck to you, I wish you the best.  At least you are not on here making an **** out of yourself on Yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  PS: you must be talking about CeCe.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	I disagree with you completely. Even though men are naturally born stronger than women physically women can exercise take a martial art and do various things that can make them stronger if not equal to men. I disagree with you because I feel if women can handle the physical qualifications then who are we to turn them away, they did what we expected and passed. And as for your comment of women should be grateful of doing medical and other crap because it is away from the front lines, if you didn't want to fight why would you join the military? So you are entitled to your opinion and I'm not going to rip you for it but I disagree and feel it is sexist to turn women away who pass the physical qualifications and have proved themselves. A bullet from a man or a woman can still kill.

They steal, they beat white people up because they say this is Indian territory.  <br>  Not 100% of them are like this but many are.<br>  I wish people would realize that we are not going to stay in the past.  This world is different then it was 100 and 200 years ago.  Everyone can try to make things better for themselves.  They don't have to blame their circumstances on what happened to their ancestors.

It's just not right.  Even if we don't hear them complaining I am pretty sure there are some hard feelings there.  Placing a few casinos near their reservations for sure does not fix the problem.  In fact some of these casinos have caused problems for them such as unhealthy living conditions from the sewage.  They should be able to keep their way of life without interference from mainstream society but also should not be forced to live in poverty because of it.  This may not be the case for all tribes but certainly for many of them.  You bring up a very valid point.|`|MO8VRa46aa	They can move out of the reservations if they want to, so they are not forced to live anywhere.

" -Deb S (SFCU) <br>  <br>  That is a really messed up thing to say. I've lived in MANY Native American communities, not just one neighborhood. They do not sit around and complaining and talk about how much they hate people. They are just people living their lives like other people. I feel sorry that they get crap like this all the time from people like you, making judgments and stereotypes. They are not angry. What you said is just as bad as insinuating that Black people are angry, Latinos are angry, Asians are angry. I know a Native American family. They have two daughters, and they are the happiest family ever. Both parents have respectable jobs, one is a programmer who has a degree in computer information systems and works at a major university. I don’t hear the family complaining about land, being angry at white people, nor are they getting rich off casinos. They are not alcoholics, steal or beat up white people. Its a shame that you would hold this family and so many other Native American families to such horrific and ignorant stereotypes. And the truth is I know many, many Native American families that don’t live up to your judgment.|`|ROGkqMPkaa	I remember the American Indian Movement (AIM) headed by Russell Means, who in 1972 took over a Nike Missile Base in Chicago, seized the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1972, and had standoffs at Wounded Knee and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1973.  They were repressed, as were the Native Americans during the 1700s and 1800s, when they were warred against repeatedly in a campaign that amounted to genocide, which can be viewed in many Western movies.  The Native Americans were so overrun and culturally dominated by the European invaders that they have been permanently oppressed, and many live in dire poverty on reservations, barely able to survive, let alone protest.|`|538ceb4acaef4ac2ccf484f71831be0caa	World history is full of tales of conquest, takeovers, and losses.

0UYJkSuZaa	My husband is a marine and he makes sure that he has a fresh hair cut any time he wears a uniform other than his cami's or coveralls. It just looks clean cut and fresh that way. An for the record not all marines are bald. They are required to have a medium to high fade. It must be a zero below the fade and can be up to I think it's 3 inches on top and then just nicely faded through the rest (I cut his hair for them). My husband keeps it pretty short though that way there's less a chance his command will get on him for thinking his hair is too long. Their hair cut causes them to appear bald when they have their covers(hats) on. The other person is correct though. If it is their picture of them in their dress blues it is taken at boot camp at which time their hair is buzzed completely bald. They do not earn the right to have a high-in-tight til a little before their graduation.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	1. No.<br>  2. You get a haircut every week.<br>  3. You follow regulations (3 inches top, 0 on sides/taper).|`|esOaJoqBaa	Without seeing what you are looking at I would say that the pics are all from boot camp, and yes they all have shaved heads there. Other than that, most of the time a Marine needs to wear their blues they will ge a haircut. Maximum length for guys is a 0-3 fade. They have to evenly fade the hair on the back and sides, and the top can only be 3 inches. Even that is considered long though.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Most dress blues pictures are taken during boot camp.  So that is what you will see most of the time.<br>  <br>  Most career officers and NCOs have another taken later on, when they have a bit more hair.  But those are rarely for public distribution.

90e77b34338856a778a43fc695156a06aa	That's an excellent question that I have asked myself many times and I don't even get high anymore (or drink). <br>  <br>  One reason, I'm sure, has to do with the tax revenues that are collected by our government on alcohol and tobacco products.<br>  <br>  Also, if you really look into the subject, marijuana, and even cocaine are not narcotic. The government and media call them that because it sounds worse and draws more attention.<br>  <br>  I am also sure that much less violence is connected to marijuana than to alcohol, but our ancestors in the 20's and 30's were paranoid of "weed" and marketed great campaigns against it's legality through media. Did you ever watch the film "Reefer Madness"? If you haven't, check it out. It will blow your mind.<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone is going to be able to explain any "outweigh" of health implications about this...because they don't exist.|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	Because it is not regulated and taxed by the government, that simple.

Everyone knows weed makes people dumb.|`|OBW7N4KKaa	because our government sucks !!|`|plBQDf7Taa	the obvious reason is that the government can't tax it...but also, it is seen as a gateway drug (meaning it is a gateway to more extreme or dangerous drugs). Really alcohol is far more debilitating than marijuana while under its influence, and alcohol is far worse for your health. I don't smoke weed at all, or drink, but i can tell you that logically, if alcohol can be socially accepted, then weed should be too. If not, then alcohol and weed should be illegal. As for cigarettes...why the hell would anyone start smoking them? they do nothing for you.|`|wWzK6eJaaa	I think Marijuana is illegal because the government cant tax it, they tax alcohol and tobacco.

You have to play this game correctly as no one wants dishonorable service. If I were you I would talk to your doctors. I would request your record be sent to a medical review board. <br>  <br>  2. If the medical route does not work then I would ask why you feel the way you do. If you cannot fight due to religious reasons then maybe a Conscience Objector Package is an option!?<br>  <br>  3. Contacting your Congress man/woman is an option but outside of the medical option all other options should be considered Nuclear. <br>  <br>  Please contact me if you need some help but you need to tread lightly!   You do not want to give up on the 9/11 GIBill that only requires 90 days active duty service. <br>  <br>  So please tread lightly and consider your path before embarking on it!|`|gDSJpRvTaa	No you need to "Grow Up"...<br>  You are probably homesick just like everyone else...<br>  <br>  But sorry that Mommy can't be there <br>  to tuck you in at night...<br>  Cause you are not getting a Discharge...<br>  You fail your MOS School...<br>  Then you will be a Grunt and Deployed<br>  to a Marine Outfit in Afghanistan quicker.<br>  <br>  The Charge for malingering is harsh...<br>  That is why you went to see a Civilian Doctor...<br>  Sorry but their Diagnosis will not hold up<br>  in the Military...and a Civilian Lawyer can't help<br>  you either...<br>  <br>  Gee didn't we just have this discussion<br>  a couple of days ago...|`|ZNbauLJzaa	The chaplain may be able to get things moving for you or may be able to help you settle down a bit.

But unfortunately, I didn't. 1987 spelled the end to AMC when it was bought by Chrysler in March of that year (2nd I believe). The problem being that, at the time we would be talking (1980's). Renault owned AMC by 51%. If AMC could have become an independent again we would have had something. The problem was that AMC had no longer been as economical as it once was. Back in the 1960's, AMC had a lot of marks that were on the same body. In the 1970's they had a couple cars that were unpopular that were on different chassis.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	yes Studebaker was a good car,so was nash and amc,they just had crappy body styles kinda like cars to day,they all look alike,just different colors.i think Studebaker is alive in canada,the Avanti is a 75,000$ car

It could potential cancel or disrupt a pending purchase or other action requiring notarized signatures as badly as if it hadn't been notarized at all.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	No you can't.

Al Sharpton is one of the most disgusting humans I have ever come to known.  Believe me, I say this with no vindictiveness or anger.  In my opinion, it's the truth.  I have never seen anyone half as racist as him, and for blacks to follow his cause is simply counter-productive to their own.|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	he needs racism  so he can remain relevant.....most racist are nothing without their cause.  The ones who scream racism the loudest generally have the most to gain from it and are the biggest racist themselves.|`|XuLVfj1caa	While he may or may not speak for the Black race, he does speak his mind about social concerns.  He is, as he said recently, an activist.  I applaud his efforts on this NY Post thing.  The post could have made this all go away very quickly by simply apologizing to anyone they may have offended.  That doesn't say they apologize for the cartoon or running the cartoon.  They could simply apologize if anyone was offended and leave it at that.  <br>  <br>  Instead, they called Al out, to which he can only do one thing....mobilize his forces and "grandstand."  I think of Al like a personal injury attorney.  Someone has to fight for the little people who's injustices would never be noticed but for people like Al.  It's the same for personal injury attorneys.  No one would ever care or notice that their impoverished clients, who normally wouldn't be able to afford representation, were taken advantage of if these attorneys didn't represent them.  Sometimes they're wrong.  Sometimes Al is wrong.  But many times he's right.  This is one of those times.

They were sentenced to three to ten years imprisonment.<br>  <br>  Some of the names and events were changed in the movie, and I don't remember all of it, but at the very end it tells you who was sentenced and what they were sentenced to.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	I don't know that anyone was ever arrested or sentenced.  A Civil Suit was filed in 1964 and was dismissed by a Judge which is the second article.  The first one is about the movie itself.  I do think that recently I remember that someone that they thought was responsible for this crime was charged with murder and I think they guy was like in his 70's or 80's but I don't remember the outcome.  <br>  <br>  OHH as far as who was guilty, I do believe that the Sheriff at the time was involved and some high ranking officials.  You know they were members of the KKK.

qnYj8n9oaa	As long as you're either in a public place or on your own property you can video tape them.<br>  <br>  So, if the child exchange takes place in your driveway or at a public park you can video take without permission.<br>  <br>  If you are on his property or at a restaurant then I don't believe you can video tape him.<br>  <br>  In the state I'm in the above applies for video footage but the best is to ask a cop or lawyer as you want it to be submitted in court. Depending on where the video exchange takes place you might be able to post a sign stating anyone entering this area automatically agrees/consents to having him/her self video taped and surrenders all legal claim to the video. I see these signs all the time at conventions as they are constantly taping and if you ask a question that they like they want to put it up as an add or as a news clip. They only have to get permission if the owner of the tape wants to ID you (if you didn't already do that on tape by stating your name).<br>  <br>  With the addition of camera phones and other devices that fit in your pocket video of people without permission is an issue. Most videos are made without permission but if they could be used in a court of law is unknown by me. <br>  <br>  Another option you could do is simply as a cop to be in the area and walk by you. If the guy is high and the cop can tell that could give him probable cause to search him or follow him back to his car. If someone looks high and gets in a car a cop can stop him and run him through some tests to confirm if he is high or not. Another angle is to get a social worker involved. Since they wear plain clothes they could just appear as a friend with you. If he is high the social worker can testify in court about this and he would most likely lose his visitation rights as being unfit to car for the kid.|`|Q904TpBzaa	yes you can. the cops do it all the time. nanny cams stand up in court all the time. you can't take a deposition with out his consent. but if your recorder takes sound it will be ok.|`|45u7BzCUaa	I'm sure you can....much like security cameras, police dash cams, reality shows cheaters, etc.|`|hRSA2bTAaa	Place a nanny cam in the area.

When there are children involved you should be doing everything in your power to act like an adult.  Behavior like the video taping will be looked upon in a court of law as childish and antagonistic.  Not to mention the negative effect it will have on your own children.  If there truly is a problem with a new husband or boyfriend being abusive to your children, petition the court for a hearing and have it settled legally.  And make 110% sure that you are not punishing a former spouse, for whatever reason.|`|AA10123414	If the exchange takes place in a public location you can.

They are not responsible for results.<br>  <br>  No planner ever got involved in the mortgage-backed securities.  That junk was created by salespeople, not business planners or economists.  Get the commission and run!<br>  <br>  Then there's the example of global warming.  Heck, they can't predict if it will rain tomorrow, and they have the gall to predict climate in 10 or 20 years from now!!!<br>  <br>  There are people who can and people who can't.  Those that can't, teach.<br>  <br>  And those who can't even teach, become weathermen or join the press and report.  Rather than predict, they just offer their "expert" opinion, even though they never accomplish anything themselves.<br>  <br>  And opions are like those other things....everyone's got one.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Yeah, the last financial crisis in 1987 I think it was...and before that, the years of the depression circa 1929-35.

No more feeling bad about abusing too many people, since his council will decide who is worthy of US real courts with real constitutional rights.

We're so transcendent now, reality doesn't matter.  Yeah.<br>  <br>  To be true, he will do nothing for us we do not hold him to.  We are in the same situation.  Congress and the people gave Bush a blank check.  They demanded nothing and got nothing.  We have the same choice now.  Even though he is there to convince people to continue along the Trilateral imperialist agenda, like with Bush, the people have power they do not exercise.

I feel like this, and I am sorry if I offend anyone, and this is just my opinion about life. You either agree or disagree. I feel like America has tried to make everything into a situation of " you were born this way or not". Being a gay is not a disease but a choice you make.  It is not my job to tell you if it is right or not. All I am saying is that now sex offenders want to stand up and say they were born this way too. Now you may say being guy and a sex offender are completely unalike, and I couldn't agree more. What I am saying is be responsible for your own decisions and take the natural or imposed consequences that come with this choice. If you choice to be gay don't be offended by the now current state of this country. You can't get married in most states. Don't act surprised or offended now that you choice. Be proud of you decision. One more opinion of mine:  I am asking for people to stop comparing a minority race (african American) to being gay or a sex offender. Being a certain race is something you do not choice. Being gay and a sex offender are choices. They are nothing the same as race.<br>  Now back to the basic question you asked. Well, like I said you choose to be a sex offender, and so therefore now you can go and enjoy the other things that go along with it.|`|0wjRVM3laa	Because most men can control their *****. Sex offenders deserve the shame they get. If they'd been born in a previous era, they may very well have been hung!|`|AA10116116	Okay, now for a real answer that may actually help you make your argument. <br>  <br>  First of all, remember that not all sex offenders are pedophiles or rapists. Some are just people that had an error in judgement. <br>  <br>  The recidivism rate for sex offenders is much lower than other crimes like drug use and drug dealing and drunk driving. They reason the media says it is high is because of the sex crimes they committed that were "never reported". Really? Is this a fact then? How about how many times a guy snorted coke and wasn't busted? Do those times count too?  <br>  <br>  the Fear Issue. You can have people put in their zip code on the registry and thousands of names will pop up. This causes undue paranoia in the public. This is exactly what the government and the media want to have happen. They want you in fear, they want you dependent on them. In reality, how many of these people on the list are actually pedophiles? how many are actually rapists? how many are actually a threat? The 21 year old frat boy that fooled around with the 17 year old at the kegger... is not exactly lurking behind trees masturbating to the 4 year old girls at the park.  Truth is... a  majority of the people on the list commited crimes like this. I know people on it for having sex with their girlfriend in the back seat of their car and having a 12 year old ride by on a bicycle. Stupid act? Yes. Future Threat? Doubtful. <br>  Now imagine they only put the really dangerous ones on the list. Then put in your zip code... not as big of a shock anymore, is it?<br>  <br>  Next Fact. The list is Unconstitutional. You can find this case has gone to the Supreme Court where it was a divided decision.  The argument is that it denies the sex offender their Right to Due Process of the Law. Once they are off probation or parole, they are finished with their sentence. So they made this law (in the name of public safety) to provide easier access to the list (which is public information anyway) to the public.  This was done because these people on the list are "potential threats" and "Might Re-offend."  So basically, they are put on this list for a crime they MIGHT commit in the future. They are shamed on this list to protect children (although most are not pedophiles) from a crime they Have Not Commited Yet and May Never Commit.  So some sex offenders have sued for their Right To Due Process as provided by the US Constitution. Their argument is that they have to have a trial in which they PROVE beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they are threat and that they are going to commit another sex crime. That is every American's right, right? Wrong. <br>  <br>  So what is next? Lists for other crimes? What is the next Consitutional Right they are going to take away from a group? I am sure you can think of a few already. <br>  <br>  Last Point: Of the stories you hear once or twice a year of some psycho that nabs a kid off the street and rapes and murders them... How often does this happen? Now that the News is national and not local, it seems to happen more often than before, or is it just because we hear about it more on the news. We hear about it in Las Vegas, even though I live in Tallahassee. The truth is, it is not happening more often or less often. But here is the point, take the number of psychos that do this, then divide it by the number of people on the sex offenders list nationwide.  It will be less than half a percent. Not good odds.  And the list did not prevent these crimes. Most are nabbed on the street and not "left at a neighbor's house to babysit".  The truth is, 95% most of these crimes happen with someone that the victim knows. The molestor has to groom the child into trusting them. It takes time. And this is just for pedophilia and child molestation. The other crimes, like I mentioned, a 16 year old hooking up with a 20 year old or a guy masturbating in his tent when he thought he had some privacy... Are not the ones that should be on the list in the first place. <br>  <br>  The point is, if a man is psychotic enough to not be able to curb an urge to grab a child off the street... the list, boundaries from living near schools, or any other law to make life harder on the sex offender, is NOT going to stop them.  Do you really think they will say "I really want to rape a 5 year old, but I can't go near the school without breaking the law" ?? <br>  <br>  These laws are made to give people a false sense of security. But in reality, it makes them feel less secure. They think they are in danger when they are not. They think they can't go out jogging without some sex crazed maniac coming after them.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this helped you get some ideas. You can do a search for most of these topics for more reliable sources than me. I am just talking off the top of my head. 
Zrq8vjaXaa	AC21 is based on the application of I-485, not through I-140 petition.  Therefore, if the I-485 has not been filed, she will not be able to port.  In fact, there is no basis for her to port.<br>  <br>  The fact that a company is going through bankruptcy does not affect her status as an H-1B.  H-1B is based on a person's job status and only ends if she is fired or laid-off.  She may apply for an H-1B with the new company (often referred to as "H-1B transfer").  However, the H-1B is not a transfer, but it is a new application based on her current H-1B Visa.  That is, she will not be required to wait until April for a new visa to be available but she can use her current H-1B visa to apply for a new one with a new employer.<br>  <br>  Lastly, she should start filing the I-485 with either the current employer as soon as possible.

l4WEwTWwaa	No, as an officer you see less action because you are telling people what to do instead of doing it as an enlisted soldier. You can only be a sniper if you are enlisted, sorry, no officers. Next you don't have to have laser eye surgery, just vision correctible to 20/20. If you wear glasses then you can still be a sniper. You just have to wear Marine issued glasses. Also you have to have incredible will power to be a scout sniper. The test for it includes staying up 3 days in a row playing out fake missions and can not fail at all. You also have to have patience as you move one foot every couple of hours.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Snipers are all enlisted men.  Officers are the leaders of the enlisted men, but are not trained as marksmen.  And I'm afraid there is little that you can do to improve your chances of becoming a sniper - there are more than enough volunteers with perfect vision, so they just will not take you.  You can still join the Marines when you're old enough and become a rifleman - but you can't be both a rifleman and an officer.  When you're old enough, go talk to the recruiters.|`|0pXBYo4paa	I think all snipers are enlisted. The officer would be giving them the orders. You can be an officer and in Delta Force, though. I am sure the officers do some pretty crazy stuff there, we just don't know about it.<br>  <br>  Be careful about Lasik and the military. It is considered eye surgery and may cause problems during your medical evaluation when signing up. I would just stick to glasses or contacts for now, at least until after you are in.
ILgk3OLOaa	Why would you think that?  Just because you'd be in the DEP for that long doesn;t entitle you to get a promotion.  That's ridiculous.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	If you are in DEP before you are 18 (which is the case most the time) you are not actually in the military until you actually enlist, go to MEPS and ship your butt to boot camp. My husband was in DEP his senior year of high school and went to boot camp as a PFC E-2 but only because he had a few of his buddies enlist with him thus giving him the promotion. That is the only way to go in as an E-2, just the fact that you are in DEP doesn't get you the rank.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	you dont get to choose how long you want to be in dep|`|n2oEhdZiaa	So you want the Marines to promote you for doing nothing for them for a longer period of time where you remain useless?  I don't think that works.|`|smU2rpKeaa	I believe you only get E-2 when you GRADUATE boot camp if you get someone to enlist while youre DEP. You recruit someone.
l4WEwTWwaa	We are in Afghanistan because it is a major spot for terrorists because the mountains enable entire armies to be hidden. Next we only burn 1000 Hectares of Opium a year. That's one percent of the drug trade. Ground fighting is expensive and costs troop lives and we only destroy 1 percent of the drug trade. We wanted to spray an air chemicle that is harmless to human life and would destroy sixty percent but the government of Afghanistan refuses to allow us to do it and we don't want to do it anyway because we are *******. My source is a newspaper article from 2006, I'll try and find it again and if I do I'll edit this and post it, but if not then yeah we aren't doing much in stopping the Opium and Heroin trade in Afghanistan.|`|AA11301908	For some odd reason stopping the person shooting at you takes priority over burning a field.<br>  <br>  See heres the odd thing about this war, after it stopped being mainstream the media really stopped caring beyond reporting on deaths, and trying to make a big fuss about it for ratings. For every one thing you do hear about 10,000 other things occurred that you didn't hear about.<br>  <br>  Trust me on this, we aren't exactly sitting around on our asses doing nothing.

So long as the laws being written are preserving those rights and freedoms, then yes we need law makers.  15 years ago identity theft wasn't a big thing.  Now it is huge.

Not everyone in this country respects the rights, property of others. Since our world...our society is an ever changing place the law has to constantly adapt to it.  This way, those people would not do the right thing on their own...are now on notice what they can and can't do. They will also face consequences for their actions.
YupMCYHlaa	It's called 'judicial review'.  It's not in the Constitution, it only goes back as far as Marbury vs. Madison in 1803.  <br>  <br>  And the Supreme Court doesn't automatically review every law to see if it meets the test of constitutionality, it only reviews a law when there is an actual case brought against it.  This is the stated purpose of the ACLU, to bring test cases to challenge laws that might not be constitutional.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	Yes, they do. It's called judicial review.
PI8VfiY1aa	When the constitution was written, there was a substantial debate. Some members didn't want to approve it and some did. They became the federalists and the anti-federalists. <br>  <br>  Basically the Anti-Federalists didn't want to ratify the constitution because: <br>  <br>  1.)It gave too much power to the national government at the expense of the state governments.<br>  2.)There was no bill of rights.<br>  3.)The national government could maintain an army in peacetime.<br>  4.)Congress, because of the `necessary and proper clause,' wielded too much power.<br>  5.)The executive branch held too much power.  <br>  6.) They feared the President would evolve into a monarch<br>  <br>  The Anti-Federalists dissolved when the bill of rights was written in 1789. <br>  <br>  Federalist were a party of a strong but small central government, which they believed was necessary to maintain order, but with a separation of powers among the branches. At the time when the constitution was written, they excluded a bill of rights because they thought it impossible to list every right imaginable. That is why our constitution is a constitution of "negative liberties." The constitution doesn't say "you have the right to jump up and down," but being a set of negative liberties, it is designed to not block any of your freedoms. <br>  <br>  Since most federalists were landowners and businessmen, the party tended to support industry. The federalist party died after the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson, the first Democratic-Republican was elected.

The Public Hangman would observe the condemned through a small spyhole in the days leading up to the event and a good practitioner such as Albert Pierrepoint could estimate his weight to the nearest pound.<br>               It was the positioning of the hangman's knot, plus the weight and the length of the drop that was crucial. When the trap opened the knot would snap the victim's neck long before he strangled.

C3gaC24Iaa	He seems to want to surround himself with a cabinet of people who are as clueless in their jobs as he is.  He has never worn a uniform, and is putting the security of Iraq at risk by accelerating the pullout, instead of sticking to General Petraeus's plan.  He hired heads of the CIA and NSA, intelleligence-gathering agencies, who are AGAINST the gathering of intelligence.  He is applying civil law to military legal cases, in relation to the terrorists of Gitmo.  He is talking nice to Iran, thinking that they are not laughing at him.  He is trying to get us out of debt, by putting us MUCH DEEPER in debt.  He can't control Pelosi's obnoxious mouth.  He hired Clinton for Sec. of State, after her husband already showed that the Clintons have at least a 3 year delaying period before they can see obvious things, like a WAR in former Yugoslavia.

I am not deluded that Obama will save anyone but him self and the politicians he has aligned him self with. If the general public made these mistakes the IRS would seize thier homes, businesses and bank accounts. Why did this not occour with the cabinet members? Obama said it is OK it just a mistake an accident. Does the IRS care if the general public has a mistake, an accident? No they do NOT. It really doesn't matter how many made mistakes, what matters is why are they still in office!  Oh and if they can't add how are they going to balance Americas debt?|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Even worse is the fact that these evaders pay no interest or penalties on their owed taxes.

AA11676794	This is transparency.    Although I wish that some of these items would have come to light prior to the appointments. The fact is that it is better that these items are given the light of day prior to the confirmations.    What few realize, is that there was significantly more corruption in government in years and generations prior. One need only read of Taminey Hall in see what I mean.    The prior administration has significantly greater moral issues than these relatively small transgressions.    I for one never understood why so few people were concerned that Haliburton and its subsidiary KBR received the lions share of no-bid military support contracts when the sitting Vice President had been its CEO.

Even given the issues with polling, he's currently got a higher approval rating than most president's have had this early in their administrations.

1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Yes!  I was watching Daschle's confirmation hearings before the tax evasion came up, and I think he's a good bipartisan man with some serious thinking time on health care reform issues.  If anyone seems qualified to take the lead in health care reform, Daschle seems to be the pick.    Eric Holder is disconcerting, to say the least.    Oh yeah, and Daschle needs to pay his back taxes + penalties to square himself away.  It worked for Geithner, who got the job, and I'm, not too crazy about Geithner.|`|VLO7e4tMaa	What about Gietner?  Hillary is starting to look like a saint!  They should all go.  I guess they mighty o is very tolerant of those with his own traits, such as dishonesty, greed, and being self-serving.|`|ewOQX1D1aa	Are you trying to create a virtual liberal whirlwind ??? My hair...My hair !!!...Getting so messed up...|`|GjvspMkQaa	No. I would make him appoint Ron Paul Secretary of the Treasury, Judge Napolitano AG, and Peter Schiff as Federal Reserve Chairman.  Oh, and submit Sound Money Legislation|`|v2hbEQyNaa	If it were my decision the answer would be no. President Obama ran a campaign on openness and ethics in his administration. So far all we have seen is a string of individuals named to his cabinet that have either criminal or unethical histories.    He needs to fire his Chief of Staff and get some help from some place else or the Democratic party will be swept from the planet in the next election.  So far Obama is a complete failure to the American people.|`|AA11702773	he could keep Daschle if he would withdraw Geitner.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	I have no problem with Daschle or Holder.  I'm not a desperate Right winger.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Holder has already been sworn in.  He was a good choice as was Daschle.

If you listen in and log on to chat, I am user HeartMySoldier. Its fun!|`|AA11847612	No, that is not true.|`|b21fa9f80551f1440779f4c03a279e4aaa	Being an only child does not stop you from deployment.  I am an only child and was sent to VietNam.       Now if you are the only child and your father is in a combat situation, they will not deploy you during that time.... but once the father is out of that area.... you become fair game again.|`|raImBqwraa	That is absolutely untrue. He has just as much right to be deployed as anyone else. Why would they take that away from him for something so menial?|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	No, no and no.  Why would it make sense if you volunteer to do something and simply becasue you're an only child they wouldn't deploy you.  Hell no.  The government is going to spend a lot of money training him and do with him as they please.|`|rYNM67oyaa	You're thinking of the only surviving son clause. This is the official position.    Surviving son or daughter     a. Any applicant who was previously separated from any Component of the U.S. Armed Forces as a surviving son or daughter requires a waiver for enlistment. Note: A surviving son and/or daughter refers to any son or daughter in a family in which the father or mother or one or more of the sons or daughters--     (1) Have been killed in action or have died when serving in the United States Armed Forces from wounds, accident, or disease.     (2) Are in a captured or missing-in-action status.     (3) Have a permanent 100 percent service-related disability (including 100 percent mental disability), as determined by the Director of Veterans Affairs or one of the military services, and are not gainfully employed because of the disability.|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	No, they can deploy him.|`|7n523JW1aa	No that's not true National Guard does get deployed regardless if he is an only child or not|`|VjRd9nb1aa	Did he volunteer only for the perks without consideration of the real reason we have armies?    Is he a wimp or a man?|`|aJBAobQyaa	No, that is not the case...The whole "non-deployable" issue arose after the Sullivan Brothers (5 brothers) were on one ship and it sank...they all died, and it wiped out the Sullivan lineage...After that happened, DoD came up with a policy not to let it happen again.  When the draft was going on, if an only child was drafted, he could seek a deferment based on the fact he was an only child.  Now days, the policy, as I understand it, is that the service members have to be advised, but if they so choose, can be stationed together.  There were 3 brothers stationed together on the ship I was on.|`|8N0C3QqNaa	No not true sorry.  He volunteered to join the military.
tvNkizDraa	It seems to be a touchy subject, especially since one of the other contenders for the RNC chair thought it acceptable to send out inappropriate CDs.  Wisely, they kicked that one to the curb.  As an Independent, I am skeptical for now.  Recent history has shown that the Republican Party would put forward a woman as a 'token' to try to win some of those disgruntled Hillary supporters. The VP nominee said that herself. It came across as both insipid and patronizing that she would actually believe Democrat and Independent women were so shallow as to forfeit their core principles just to vote for a female. I sincerely hope that Michael Steele can pull the splintered Republican Party out of the clutches of the religious coalitions and pull the party back to its fiscal (rather than social) conservative roots. Until I can see how the RNC performs under Steele's stewardship, I will remain skeptical.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	What change of heart are you talking about? What was their position before previously choosing Steele?  The implication by phrasing your question that way is that they were against minorities until electing Steele....we're not as dumb as you think.|`|eqDXoCeTaa	What's your point?  Were you ranting?  Sounds like it.|`|tu2VbI0zaa	Him being selected was new to me...I really dont' know what he stands for...and will fight for...    Which honestly all that matters to me...|`|k1jwNKbgaa	Get over yourself.    "Why the change of heart?" is a completely unfair question, and it insinuates that we're racists.    As I said before - Steele is a very well respected Conservative, and was a front runner to replace Duncan a long time ago.    We don't FIRST look at someone's race, as a qualification -like Harry Reid.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	I don't understand your origianl question. It doesn't make sense. When the RNC was last filling the chairman position, Michael Steele was busy running as the Republican candidate for Senator in Maryland.    So, I don't understand the question. What does it refer to? Is it supposed to make some kind of sense?|`|85be78e04e9f820a7ce075e3e85248e8aa	hmm.. what makes you think that its a race thing i heard he was more then qualified!|`|noo8vpvzaa	First of all:    "Republicans, why the change of heart??"     What do you mean by that?...I've supported Steele for quite a while, and I haven't had a 'change of heart'...Perhaps you should have been more specific about what you meant...I didn't see your deleted question, so I don't know if you made yourself more clear in your description, but if you didn't, what did you mean?    Second:  "Do u think the question scared or intimidated some RNC fans?"    Did you ask something scary?...Were you attempting to 'scare or intimidate' someone?...I'm not sure how you structured the question you're referencing, but you're really not making very much sense at the moment|`|CmG8oTH0aa	Well, it seems that "change" is now going to become their slogan.      Its so odd considering how stupid they all thought that word to be.|`|Souvww0maa	What scares me is people that are too lazy to type out whole words, like "y-o-u".|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Change of heart?  My heart didnt change about him.  What do you mean?|`|AA11702773	There wasn't a change of heart, this guy was close to the Bush and Cheney types.     Which is why I (a Republican) don't like him.      Note, my reasons aren't because he is black either.  I felt the same way about McCain.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	I don't understand, why do you consider electing Steele a change of heart?  By the way, I didn't report your other question.

QlzFoBS3aa	When the day comes..that men get pregnant and therefore are carrying the baby for 9 months and giving birth too....then they deserve to have a right to be either pro life or pro choice...with that baby...Until then, they have not earned the right to make that decision.  It's not THEIR bodies doing it.<br>  Also men abandon their children way to easily after breakups and divorces...If you think otherwise...your mistaken.....just go down to any family court house or public assistance building and see for yourself!!!|`|oO4TUkVkaa	We beleive that a child should not be killed because a mother was to lazy to think about preventing an unplanned pregnancy before she had sex.  It's like the law that you can't kill anyone.  We are not telling you what to do with your body we are telling you what you can't do with the childs body.|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	I'm a republican, and I do believe in Pro Choice. I dont believe its a good thing too do, but I understand why it is done.<br>  <br>  I also believe in a Choice FOR MEN! As in, we have a choice to help you raise the child. The problem is, women get to choose, but men are forced into paying child support with NO CHOICE.<br>  <br>  I dont believe in partial birth abortion, which is just plain murder..|`|PG2gd1tOaa	This has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard...when she becomes pregnant her body belongs to the baby, what an insane argument Pro- abortion people come up with and it amazes me even more the number of brainless men I see thinking abortion is the womans right...who is the father to this baby? The only thing I can think of is the men that say abortion is only the womans right are those men that would not pay child support so killing the baby is easier. I assume by your argument you see nothing wrong with a 13 year old girl being able to legally have an abortion without her parents permission, this is what Obama is for...odd isn't it that a school can't dispense an aspirin to a 13 year old but that same 13 year old can get an abortion without the parents permission. You people are insane.|`|WL3KcegWaa	Does the baby get a choice????<br>  <br>  So to further your logic the unborn child's body belongs to....  who???<br>  <br>  Whoops.... forgot about that one didn't you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The problem with the pro-choice argument is that most pro-abortionist do not see any other choices.  Such as contraception and abstinence.  They only advocate for abortion.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	most republicans think the government is incapable of owning, and running anything, including a woman's body.|`|f7KKrMJvaa	You're right you can kill your baby any time you want, I'm not against your personal choice.|`|ejluOCdTaa	Yes a woman's body belongs to her....but what gives her the right to terminate a life that SHE made?<br>  <br>  The child has no rights?

Be allowed to grow to full term and come into the world<br>  B. Be hacked up into 1,000 pieces and sucked out into a plastic baggie & thrown away, or injected with saline solution and sucked out.

He violated the "no fly zone" in order to do this. He also used gas to kill those innocent lives.<br>  While his nation suffered under his dictatorial insanity, and lack many basics (due to UN sanctions), he was rebuilding his military.<br>  Apparently, his foray into Kuwait and his resulting defeat did not teach him very much.<br>  There may or may not have been WMD when we finally started our own inspections, but the threat was real.<br>  He had already used them in his war with Iran.<br>  He had them during the Gulf War.<br>  He was thwarting inspections to make sure he did not rebuild his stock pile.<br>  So the need to go in was valid and necessary.<br>  I only wish the initial effort in Iraq had been conducted as it is now being fought. Too many lives have been ruined or lost due to those mistakes.<br>  I hope the lessons learned in Iraq will be applied in our renewed efforts in Afghanistan.|`|UKrSb081aa	I'm sorry that you are an ignorant Obama voter.

Unless millions of deaths are fine by you.|`|VM300US7aa	Cheney dared Bush.<br>  <br>  No really, I don't know.  It's rumored Bush had always wanted to finish what his father had started, so they tried to make a case to invade Iraq, even though they had nothing to do with 9-11 and Afghanistan did.  Unfortunately the country was still caught up in revenge mode, so any invasion of any mid-east country was an easy sell to the American public.  What a mess.|`|mULVP4k4aa	You're absolutly right. The thing we should have done was stay in afghanistan however there was legitiment evidence that Iraq had WMDs. Obviously they didn't but the war has not been a failure. We have liberated millions of people, overthrown a currupt dictator, and still defeated many of the jihad in Iraq, it just probably wasn't the best move at the time.|`|L0Dp5uYWaa	We've been in Afghanistan since 2001, we've never left.

We owe more than it's worth.  It isn't the bank's fault or responsibility.  It isn't the fault or responsibility of other tax payers.  It is our responsibility.  We agreed to the loan.  No one forced us.  It was our responsibility to read and understand our loan (we did and the loan was a reasonable fixed rate loan).  We knew that jobs were leaving the area but we didn't think that it would hit us in a lower middle class neighborhood.  It did.  That still doesn't mean that we aren't responsible.<br>  <br>  If the value of my home had went up, I wouldn't have shared the profits.  Now that the value has went down I'm not going to share the responsibility.<br>  <br>  As far as those who say that we're "lucky", the company that I worked for closed and I was the main wage-earner in our home.  However, we made sure when we took out the loan that it was for a low enough amount that even if either of us lost our jobs our home would be safe.  We CHOSE to live below our means.  There's no "luck" to that.  It was a responsible choice.<br>  <br>  Even if offered a handout, I'm not interested.  I don't want other people to shoulder my responsibilities.  I am capable of doing that myself.|`|fd270a67b3b8b1479a1e7fcdadd75178aa	No. But I would take the money back from those whom participated in the market manipulation to artificially increase the price of real estate in order to make a short term profit.

Every state has different traffic laws. There are 14 states that border Canada and Mexico, so a Border Patrol Agent would have to be knowledgeable of the laws of all 14 of these states.

HUSSEIN OBAMA.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Yes and they call themselves progressive.:)|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No, the real left is bashing Obama.    Obamas breathtakingly rapid disavowal of his own campaign pledges expresses far more than his own dishonesty and cynicism. It reflects a deep crisis of American democracy. The existing institutions and political framework are impervious to the democratic expression of the popular will. Whether a Democrat or a Republican is in office does not impact the basic direction of government policy. The two-party system functions ever more crassly as the instrument through which the ruling financial oligarchy exercises its political power and controls the state. It flows from this essential political fact that the direction of the Obama administration will not be altered by popular pressure from the left, as claimed by the myriad left-liberal and petty-bourgeois protest organizations oriented to the Democratic Party. The end to war and inequality, and a settling of accounts with the crimes of American imperialism, cannot be realized within the framework of a degenerated capitalist-imperialist regime. What is required is not changethe hollow mantra of the Obama campaignbut social revolution.    If there is one salutary impact of Obamas election, it is that it will discredit the Democratic Party and its use of identity politics as a means of diverting attention from the class struggle and the oppressive and exploitative nature of capitalist society. The fight for social equality, which requires the unity of the working class, was replaced with the allocation of social privileges to small sections of various minority and/or oppressed groups. For decades, the proponents of American liberalism, backed by the various petty-bourgeois radical groups, have sought to elevate race, gender and sexual orientation as the essential categories of American society, while deliberately obscuring the significance of class. The rise of identity politics has coincided with a sharp move to the right by the Democratic Party. The promotion of affirmative action and similar policies has been accompanied, however, by deepening social inequality, including an enormous growth of social inequality within the black population. With the election of Obama, racial politics will be put to the test. The decisive social category in the United States and in every country remains class. And as class struggles erupt, they will sooner rather than later be directed against the new Obama government.|`|DY9NOh4taa	That is all they have left to do since their man is already in self-destruct mode and won't seek help from the people who know best.  They feel they have to do is to blame Bush, he was not the cause of a 15 point drop in Obama's approval rating after the first week in office.  All of a sudden the golden boy is beginning to tarnish, and he can only blame himself for the policies that he is setting, is having a negative impact on those who approved of Obama and gave him the 76 point rating.  I know they didn't survey people around me because they all supported John McCain, and Sarah Palin, as the best choice for America.  Barack Obama has a meager 3+ years as a junior Senator, to put on his resume, while McCain was a war hero who survived the infamous Hanoi Hilton, during the Vietnam War.  Former President Bush accomplished more during his 8 years in office than anyone can imagine, including finally making Saddam Hussein pay for the crimes that he committed during his 30+ year reign of terror over the Iraqi people, and those in neighboring countries.  He stepped up to the plate and delivered after the attacks of 9/11, and assured the country that those who were responsible would be held accountable and pay for their crimes against the American people.  Bush also started a hunt for Osama Bin Laden, which should have never needed to be done, however Bill Clinton failed to act during two occassions when Bin Laden had been located, and their were assets in place to take Bin Laden out.  So let the Democrats sling their mud, there are more than enough sins that Democrats have committed, that would fill a book.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	He deserved it.

In fact I volunteered for the McCain campaign making phone calls on behalf of the RNC in Arlington and yes, I criticized him when he was RUNNING for president for voting YES to the bailout (like Obama did).   In fact, I saw plenty of McCain volunteers that were also upset that McCain voted yes.   I think too many Obama supporters blindly accept anything he did when he was running to be quite honest and I think they still make excuses for him.  I feel like it's my job as an American to question those who have or seek this level of power.  I'm honestly glad he did not win because I think we need a real conservative in there at this point.  McCain is a good man, but we need someone willing to say no to these atrocious "stimulus packages".    See, I focus on criticizing leaders for the big stuff not trivial nonsense.

ODf41iN4aa	Fortunately I do not meet many of that type of people here on the left coast & have only heard about them from newspaper stories. Certainly, dittoheads can appear on all sides of the political spectrum, & we need to pay attention to be sure they are harmless.  Nevertheless, we have people here from Progressives to Liberterians (fewer of Them), & fortunately quite a few of us at least try to talk about the issues for ourselves.  Admitedly, though, the majority of us here on the left coast lean to the left & becomed so assuming about what we think is "everyone's" opinion, only to have to face sometimes that the rest of the nation, & sometimes even the rest of California, has voted the opposite to the way we have voted.  For instance, we were shocked when Governor S. was elected because we never met anyone who planned to vote for him.  Ditto for Prop. 8, making gay marriage illegal.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I experienced the discomfort that several of my friends in women's organizations were extremely irate toward me for supporting Obama rather than Hilary Clinton.  One co-worker even mouthed slogans the Clinton fans were saying about Obama, while I told her she had no logical proof that those predictions would come true, namely that leaders from other countries would walk all over him due to his inexperience.  Soon I learned that I was not alone in favoring Obama.  I don't know how well I would have stood up to others in a more conservative state.  In any case, I felt I'd favored Obama before the majority voiced their preference for him.<br>  <br>  The good news is that we have a high voter turnout in this area.  We have high turnout at the debates held at the college & put on by The League of Women Voters with the college Political Science Dept. & the Communications Studies Dept.  After the speakers give their intros, people race to the mikes & wait in line to ask questions for candidates' races & for state propositions & local measures.  We see exactly zero hesitance to ask questions, even though it means setting aside shyness & being televised by Public Access TV.  <br>  <br>  Talk radio does fairly well here with getting call-in comments, especially for heated issues with opinions varying.  I've even learned to call in, drink water, & breath, & no longer lose my voice when calling in.   Sure, there are days when the hosts have trouble getting any responses & instead turn to planned topics.  Most of our stations are lliberal stations.  The far right & the bobblehead nationally syndicated hosts don't even air much around here.  I wouldn't know which station I'd turn to in order to hear them.  <br>  <br>  The nationally syndicated programs we have here are Money Talk, consumer advocate Clark Howard, Dr. Joy, psychiatrist, & the weirdo late night space alien/ghost etc. program, Coast-to-Coast-a.m.  (Hey! That's my favorite!) Political conservatives need not apply.  That's pretty funny that people outgrew the hippie era, & we started listening to the investment programs in spite of liberal political views.  As if that investment guidance did us any good.  Well, at least some of us don't owe any money.<br>  <br>  So, we have a bit of the extremists here on the left, along with the assumption that everyone thinks the same way that we do.  After all, everyone we know agrees with us, & it's ALMOST safe to discuss politics at work because we almost agree on everything, with only a few battles.  So, there are the same problems & types of assumptions as on the right...just not so much dangerous bigotry (I'm joking.)<br>  <br>  Well, I'll try to shorten this another day.  It's a bit redundant.  Sorry.|`|oETuw7UVaa	I am a proud dittohead. Rush is brilliant.<br>  <br>  Hannity however stinks.

bf45coU8aa	1) you need to understand what a liberal democracy is.  Simple democracy can easily become tyranny, and so it needs checks and balances on its power, just like everything else.    2) the Lords is unelected because it does a superior job to any elected House.  The quality of the work it does trumps the Commons as it is is full experts in particular fields who dedicate their interests to the work of Parliament.  This contrasts with the elected MPs who can only be generalists at best.    3) the Commons can override the Lords if they so desire. but this can be a double-edged sword as it can draw attention to contentious issues that the government would rather slip through.  The Lords saved us from draconian 'national security' legislation last year - NOT the Commons.    4) this corruption is not an example of Lords corruption, but of Labour corruption.  The vast majority of Lords are as disgusted as you and I, and will gladly do everything in their power to prevent it occuring again.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	"AN" democracy ?

Fair enough, they can delay them getting passed. Finance Bills dont go to the HOL anyway. :)|`|AA11366224	Certainly not.  The House of Commons contains people who have been elected but then have up to five years to ignore the electorate.  The House of Lords used to be full of the descendants of land grabbers and sheep stealers, but now it's just full of Blair's cronies.    The House of Lords can impede legislation passed by the Commons, but eventually the Commons can ignore them.|`|AA11847612	Here's a dirty little secret: None of our world governments today are democracies. Democracy literally means that 50% + 1 gets their way. No government works this way.    The fact of the matter is most of these "democratic" nations are oligarchies. This means the ruling of the majority by a few elite.    But since we've been children, we've been spoonfed this notion that we live in a democracy and all our voices matter. Nothing could be farther from the truth.|`|1amF7oNwaa	The House of Lords in England doesn't really have much power.|`|98JZcrO6aa	No because the people in the Houses of lords, although a few of them are corrupt, they are specialised in certain areas for example, if a law asked by the commons to increase regulation on banks, the lords decide whether it would be good for banks.     Also, if the lords reject the law that the commons want, the commons can then ask for the law to be passed again, if the lords reject it the 2nd time. If the commons still want the law to be passed,it must be passed without the consent of the lords.     So in a nut shell, if the commons want a law to be passed 3 times after being rejected twice, the lords must accept the law regardless. The House of Lords is really there as advisors to see who will be affected if the law passed by the commons goes through.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	The purpose of the House of Lords and the Judiciary is to provide checks and balances to ensure there is no abuse of power by Parliament.  It is a valuable safeguard put in place to ensure that Parliament does not overstep the mark.    The Government makes a big deal about how it is democratically elected, but although there may have been a vote when the Labour Party was elected, Labour were certainly not elected by a majority of the vote ... they only got 33% at the last General Election.  Since that time, the Government have run roughshod over people, and seem hellbent on their own agenda irrespective of the views of the nation.  So much for democracy.

v6l3o2kvaa	Well I'm in the Guard and for every state they do have public affairs units or detachments.  Your basically the state news team, traveling around and getting stories about units deploying, retirements, natural disasters the guard is helping out with.  My friend gets called all the time and goes throughout the state and covers these stories and really loves it.  Even the officers in that unit go and travel around getting stories, and their annual trainings are great too.  They've gotten to go to alot of cool places like Japan, England, and Korea.    You need to remember though that the guard and reserves are part time, but they do have fulltime positions for public affairs in the guard.  Granted this is the Kansas Public Affairs Unit but I'm sure it's the same story in most other states.  I don't know what to tell you about the reserves but I've honestly rarely seen them out in the community getting stories and really using their MOS.

1amF7oNwaa	We are not even close to the Great Depression and I have my doubts it will get that bad but we are making a lot of the same mistakes that were made back then.    The biggest threat we have today in regards to our economy is that the Far Left controls Congress & the White House.  They want to create a European Social Democrat System with One Party Rule (Democratic Party).  With the power they have right now, they have a good chance of achieving that goal.  If that happens, we will never fully recover from this economic mess.  The other big danger we face is Hyperinflation.|`|fPMVuB87aa	r u sirius?|`|WCkOUF9aaa	You are going to write a paper based on what you see here???    You are kidding right?
4SrdYUuSaa	Hmmmmm . . . . I thought if I jumped on the question, I would be outnumbered.  Who would have thought?    I am and always have been a Conservative.  There is more power in the private dollar for those in need than there is in a government run program.  While it is our President's intent to provide for the needier, utilizing the resources of the "haves", it will prove a dismal failure.    Romney was the ONLY candidate with the business prowess to pull this off . . . and the only one in history to run the Olympic Games with a profit.  That is no small feat.    That soap box being exhausted, and more in line with your question, I believe the excitement of President Obama's leadership, however, will generate a "We Can Do It Attitude" among the American People.    Your question is poignant though with reference to color (and maybe youth appeal as well).  See the linked interviews on YouTube.  I was very disappointed in the lack of issue-based knowledge by the voters.      I believe the Americans will pull America out of the gutter and bring our country and our citizens back into a respected position.  (Thanks for posting this!)|`|it2UVkF4aa	This isn't coming from me, but some folks are saying that United States President Barack Obama is inevitably the most skulldruggery politican American citizens will ever see. They go on to say that his "Change" motto = more suffering. If it's all of that, then hey, President Barack Obama? I have 25 important words to say to you: Arlington National Cemetary is full of skins and bones--all from Bush's political incorrectness. So, don't be like the tyrant whom you succeeded.|`|AA11459642	I didn't vote for him, but as bad as the economy is, I sincerely hope he does well. He has a tough road ahead, I believe that Romney would of been the best candidate, but its my humble opinion.   He needs to get tough with his foreign policy, he is being looked at as weak.  He needs to start looking into the backgrounds of his nominees.  It's too early to tell on how he is going to benefit us.|`|XJU2nVqxaa	I don't think Obama is going to benefit us at all. I'm glad for equal rights but that is not the issue here. We shouldn't nominate someone just because it is a chance to make your place in this world. Obama is a very left winger with Socialistic tendencies. I think over time this will be proven to the American people.|`|AA11156037	wondering how you feel about our president.   A. I think he's a conman just like Clinton but he's got every person of colour SCREAMINg that if you don't love Obama that You are a racist regardless that he's not qualified to be in the HOT SEAT and, if you listen to some, possibly NOT eligible to be President.     Everyone is ecstatic that he is black and that was the only basis in which al ot of people voted.   How do you believe he is going to benefit us as a whole?  A. No benefits, just detriments:  1. We will be attacked AGAIN  2. We will continue to lose prestige and clout in the world.  3. (Fanatical) Islam will continue to rise.  4. Our economy will go further down the sewage pipe.  5.

If he signs it, he will be the next Jimmy Carter and will be out on his a$$ in 4 years.    Like most politicians, I liked what he said, but didn't vote for him because all politicians lie and you can only base things on their associations and their performance.  Both of which were lacking for Obama.    So, even though I HOPE he is going to be smart and get us out of this toilet of an economy, his constituents in the House and Senate seem to be awfully callous when it comes to the garbage they are going to shovel onto our stoops in the name of "stimulus."    We don't need more STD education or increased voter registrations in poor neighborhoods, we need JOBS.

LNwd9gXNaa	As scary as it may seem.. we need them.  Were ther no police, there would be a ton of dumb asses just trying to see what they could get away with.  Martial Law essentially.  It sounds as if the police in your area are less than helpful, and you havnt had too many good experiences.  Trust me.  There are good cops out there.  Sadly the bad ones give a bad name to all of them.  I know that if the good ones had thier way.. there wouldnt be any B.S speed clocking, or harrassing traffic stops.   Ya just need to believe that for every asshole cop you see... there are 3 good ones who didnt let being a cop go to thier head.   (im not a cop., But i respect thier job)|`|ZATeGhkbaa	One night when you are getting bashed,who are you going to call?|`|AA11083526	I used to feel the same way, the cops in my hometown (cheyenne) never would do anything, it seemed that they would take the petty crimes over the murderers.

You may still hate them, but at least you'll have some sort of idea where they're coming from.|`|OVUkamlpaa	Stop breaking the law, then you will have no reason to hate them.|`|DKWN7VjGaa	I would say first of all that I can't imagine what must have happened to you to make you feel like that. Then I would have to say that such a generalization is just like saying you hate all plumbers or cashiers. There are no two people in the world who are exactly alike, God created everyone differently and where you may have one cop who loves to write tickets you will have another one who hates it and writes them only when he has to for public safety. Just as one plumber may rip you off and the next will give you a great deal. No two police officers are alike, they can be rude, kind, outgoing, shy, single, married with a family. It is difficult for some people to realize if they do not personally know a police officer but they are just like everyone else, you have probably struck up a conversation with a cop while he was grocery shopping with his wife and would never have even known. You may have even walked away thinking what a nice guy that was. I assure you they do not live in their uniforms. Just as you do not live in yours.|`|3PdBGesIaa	i bet you wouldn't hate them if one saved one of your kids ,mother ,or wife from being raped or murdered .or if you wondered on the wrong side of town and 4 guys was beating your @ss just because of your skin color .and a cop showed up and broke it up .it would chang your mind<br>  <br>  im a ex convict and used to feel the same way until i needed them one time ,and i change my prospective of them after that|`|2gWJjIEfaa	Were just doing our job.

T8nap2Pnaa	Well, first off you need to talk to your high school administration. if they issued you an I-20, you're probably already registered with USCIS and you're now under F1 status as a student. If that's not the case, you do have a problem as you'd be out of status. If you are properly registered with USCIS, then you don't need a student visa unless you leave to go home on vacation. In that case, you'd need a proper student visa to return.

Generalizations don't work for me.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	It depends on which taxes...  for example, my property taxes are a fraction of what they should be.

QEYFU5Lvaa	Living in a neighborhood full of foreclosed houses definitely reduces the property value of the other houses around it.  A town near where I live got hit hard with the foreclosure bug and the houses there are now worth half of what they were 5 years ago.<br>  <br>  Getting breaks on mortgages so people can keep their homes is a far better option than allowing rampant foreclosure.|`|AA11056021	If they default on their mortgage then they should get foreclosed on.<br>  <br>  "It seems?" Of course the property value will go down.  But I would rather live in a ghost town then next to people who live beyond their means.  Do you think giving them a hand out will change their ways?<br>  <br>  Also what do you mean by, "you don't know how the neighborhood will change,"?  What are you insinuating?  i hope it's not what it sounds like.  Because I would not care what color the new owners were, just that they paid their mortgage so that everybody else who does pay their mortgage does not have to suffer because of them?|`|n2kBUWQOaa	Typical calling card of the Obama regime. Do this, because the alternative might be worse.

They have gotten billions and billions of our money already. Most homes are way overvalued anyway.<br>  <br>  I think the plan now is to drive people out of the newer homes 1-15 years old, devalue them to rock bottom and then move in the government sponsored mortgage holders, and you can take what you from that.

2pJfVvwcaa	That is a very good question. I believe it all depends on when the I-130 (petition application) was approved, not when the visa was finally assigned. See, the I-130 may have been approved years ago, but the immigrant visa may still not be available because of the limit in numbers every year. If that's how it works, then your brother still will receive an immigrant visa, even when being over 21. Best is to ask an actual immigration lawyer.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Neither your Brother or You can come on<br>  her Visa as you are Both Adults...not minor<br>  Children...<br>  <br>  Being a Non US Citizen "Green Card Holder"<br>  If she even gets one(Which I doubt she will)<br>  ...can not sponsor anyone.<br>  Only a US Citizen can do that...|`|aUnPOLWEaa	nop........just like what happent to my sister after he 21 he gon even you if you tern 21 it over for you to y friend .......but after your mom go to us abd hav her citezn she could pitition for you and you brother but it take 5 year s for your  mom to get citzen and 1 year after she file for you <br>  good luke

YjG1TEJoaa	If it were followed, it would result in some 90% of federal laws being abolished overnight.<br>  <br>  Each individual state would decide their own laws. This would allow Americans to compare one state's results with another. Our founding fathers thought this would allow Americans to learn from other state's mistakes so the best law would eventually become law everywhere.<br>  <br>  But, as we look around, we see that's not what's happening. Instead people believe federal trumps state law in everything! It looks like the Tenth Amendment pretty much died decades ago.<br>  <br>  Just imagine if social security, welfare, abortion, the enviornment, and a host of other things were not regulated by federal law. We'd be able to see 50 different ways to handle these things and choose what we wanted in our own state. THAT is a pretty large effect! And it's a benefit we are currently missing out on.

YsUnEnYqaa	Easily B.    My father was there in the Marine Corps and according to him it was a slaughter, because the "gooks" actually came out and tried to fight toe to toe.

Military disaster for the communist supporters, psychological and political defeat for the U.S.A.|`|Nb413oN5aa	D is correct after Tet the VC and NVA had to start using Chinese mercenaries|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	B. The Viet Cong were permanently finished as a fighting force, the NVA were unable to mount operations of greater than regimental size for months, and General Giap seriously thought about calling it quits, he was beaten so badly.  On the other hand, Walter Cronkite didn't see it that way, and he pronounced the war "unwinnable." President Johnson realized that when he lost Cronkite, he'd lost the support of the American people, and what happened on the battlefield no longer mattered.  The major lesson of the war is that you never want to believe naysayers, especially if they're associated with the Democratic party or CBS news. That still holds true today.|`|nkA5NMUsaa	b.|`|0IYqBZewaa	a b|`|NW7SSt2uaa	All of your choices have a bit of truth in them.  The battle was a resounding American Military success.  The Viet Cong were crippled for years after that.  But, and there's always a but, the American people wanted out and didn't care what it cost.  So eventually we left the war unresolved so ultimately it was a Communist victory in the long run.  I knew people there at the time and they were good people who just wanted to live their lives in freedom.  But in the long run they didn't get to do that.  The battle itself was a defeat for the communist supporters but the loss of the war was a defeat for the US.  For years after the war our allies wondered if we would stick with them in adversity.  And of course the war set the US Army back years, it ruined the infrastructure of the Army that took at least a decades to fix.  But we did manage it.  Well that's my two cents.  Good luck to you pardner.|`|vOI3u9jfaa	Where the hell have you been jerk off? charlie may have surprised us,but he got his *** kicked.

AA10123414	It does not matter what the bar owner wants, he does not press charges the DA does. THe case is not the bar owner v. you, it is the state v you. They don't need him to prosecute you. they can compel any witnesses to the act to appear.|`|5fMAvu5naa	It is the state vs you not the bar.The DA presses the charges and consequently is able to drop them.A letter from the bar owner will not suffice, they need the owner to show up voluntarily.Why? In this day and age of computers , the court will think you made you own letter up.If you can get the bar owner to vouch for you , it will weigh alot in your favor, or should weigh alot depending on your attitude and the bar owner's attitude.If you have no other history with the court system, the charges should be dropped.Show up , with the bar owner and proof of payment, and the approach the situation with remorse.As for the bond if you show up with the right attitude and have a good reason for missing your court date, that should be removed as well.But it is all up to you to approach it in the right manner.Good luck and let us know how it goes

They do.  ESPECIALLY if your car is older and you're driving all cautious.   <br>  Did you lose your license or was it revoked?  If you lost it, then that is not a big deal.

For the headlight, they will probably issue a warning unless you're not haute.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you lost the license due to suspension, you will not go to jail. You'll get a citation.  AND a fine (ticket) for the headlight.  don't drink, either.

XryJTPN4aa	Taking meth. The addiction causes both mental and physical "problems" which pretty much end the user's abilities to led a regular working life. Once the user quits or loses their job, the meth user will do whatever crime to provide the next hit.<br>  <br>  In 2007 (last year figures were available) in my city (one of the largest in the state), approximately half of the "serious" property crimes (ie motor vehicle theft, fraud, forgery, ID thefts, copper thefts etc) were determined to be committed by addicts (usually meth).<br>  <br>  As for violence.

Drugs are expensive (mostly because they are illegal).  Some drug users are wealthy and/or hold down good paying jobs ... they don't need crime to buy drugs!  A lot of drug users are poor, have low paying jobs (or no job at all), and have few prospects for getting a job.  <br>  <br>  The last group might resort to crime to buy drugs, after they are no longer able to borrow money, and their dealer will no longer let them "run a tab".<br>  <br>  Drug dealers might allow their "clients" to buy on credit ... but if they don't pay the dealer can't really take them to court!  Dealers might "make an example" of a buyer every now and then to keep the other buyers paying!<br>  <br>  Transporting these illegal substances is also a risk, the police don't pay for what they confiscate!  Runners have a big interest in not getting caught or losing a shipment!  They have been known to respond with violence if officers try to take them into custody!<br>  <br>  Then there is retaliation on people that turn in dealers, storage facilities, and transportation networks.  Not to mention "site security" of these facilities!

If a "Marshall plan" type solution was available at the end of WWI, I think the European front of WWII could have been avoided. As far as Japan, that's a trickier problem.

YsUnEnYqaa	Depends on what his/her job is....? If he/she's just a friend, why wrap yourself up in their business?    Truth be told, there is nothing to worry about. The NG gets called up in the event of a national emergency, or like currently, deployed to Iraq/A-Stan to fill holes in manpower. If he is an infantryman then he will either be in a guard post, or out on combat patrols or convoy security if deployed. If he's a different MOS, then he/she will never leave the base most likely.     It's his/her choice, you should support them in whatever they choose. After all, it's their life, not yours. I had similar friends trying to dictate to me what is best for me in argument about me joining the military. It only aggravated me more, and the decisions ended up changing my life for the better.|`|v6l3o2kvaa	National Guard is a state militia, and they are the state governors army so to speak.  They're exactly like the reserves except they represent the state.  The National Guard is trained and deployed just like the reserves and active duty.  They have the same jobs/MOS but they do it on a part time status, they get deployed just as easily or as much as active duty but the National Guard treats each other more like a family and some units have several family members in the same unit.  Also if there's a weather made disaster or something like that the National Guard is called up to help the people either in their state or another.    So in short he really has nothing to worry about but there's always a risk, like deploying or the everyday risks we go through.  So I would say you or him don't have alot to worry about

The facility is capable of housing a maximum of 313 inmates. These inmates are housed, based on security level, from a dormitory type area for work release and trustees to single cells for maximum-security inmates.    The detention facility houses three basic types of persons, those who are awaiting bond or trial, those who have been sentenced to serve time, and those who are being held for other agencies, such as federal inmates and illegal immigrants. The average daily population in this facility is around 300 inmates of which about 10% are female.    Inmates in the facility are provided with the essentials of life, including clothing, meals, hygiene items, and medical services. In addition, extra services, such as a facility barber, psychiatric examination, the ability to purchase items from commissary, and numerous programs offer the inmates outlets to minimize problems between the inmate population and staff.    Many services, such as the barber and commissary, inmates pay for themselves. Inmates are allowed to have unlimited funds on their account. Family and friends may place money on an inmate account daily between the hours of 8:00 am and 2:00 p.m. and from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. This is done in the main lobby area of the facility. Additionally money, in the form of a money order, may be sent through the mail.    Virtually all of the inmates needs are supplied by the facility. Therefore, very few items are allowed to come into the facility from the outside. The only clothing items that are allowed to be brought in, without special permission, are clothes that would be used in a trial appearance. All other items, such as educational material, medicines, etc., must have the approval of the facility administration.    When an inmate is transferred from pre-arraignment to general population items of bedding, facility clothing and a hygiene kit are issued. This includes a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, washcloth, and underwear. To supplement this the inmate may purchase a host of items off the facility commissary. These items include candy, potato chips, undergarments, tennis shoes, and a large list of personal hygiene and grooming supplies. In addition, the facility barber performs weekly haircuts, which is charged to the inmates account.    Inmates are allowed to receive and send mail to family, friends and legal representatives. Incoming mail must have the facility address and the inmates name clearly shown. This mail may be subject to inspection for contraband prior to delivery to the inmate. Inmates may send as many letters out as they wish, providing they have the funds to do so.    Medical services are not denied any inmate in the facility. There is a medical screening performed as the person enters the facility, and a full physical done, by medical staff, within the first fourteen days of incarceration. Sick call is performed daily by qualified medical personnel and treatment provided. If the inmate is deemed too ill to be housed in general population, the facility has a six bed medical ward to accommodate their needs.    A number of facility programs have been made available to the inmates. These include, but are not limited to, Alcoholics Anonymous, PORA, GED testing, recreation, library services, and church services. In addition, work crews from the facility go out into the community and perform services such as trash pick up and snow shoveling for the elderly.    Telephones are placed in every cellblock in the facility. Inmates are allowed to make as many calls daily as they wish, providing the calls are collect. Other options, for inmates, are to purchase calling cards from the facility or place money on a debit account. A $5.00 card will allow ten minutes of calls, and the inmate may purchase any number of these cards weekly. Incoming calls for inmates are strictly forbidden.    Visitation for inmates in the facility is held at four different time periods weekly. The visits run from 20 to 25 minutes in length and are monitored. Each inmate may have up to two visits per week, with one of those occurring on a weekend. For visitation times for any particular inmate call (217) 753-6886.      The inmates of the facility are supervised by a staff of 72 correctional officers and 27 control room operators. The staff is thoroughly trained in the handling of inmates and in response to emergency situations. Officers must undergo a basic training course of five weeks, which is supplemented by ongoing training.    The Sangamon Co

I'm sorry you feel the Dream is gone but in other places of the world the dream is never even an option. For example, The Dalits in India are born as lower class citizens and are all categorized as less than human. They have zero chance to achieve anything. You really need to reevaluate yourself and realize that even though America isn't in the of best hands (Obama's, in my opinion) that we are still allowed the opportunity for success.    For all those who seriously don't believe that America is the land of opportunity, I would highly recommend you watch the documentary "God Grew Tired of Us".|`|fj6YUwBUaa	The american dream is the ability to make something of yourself without any help and a little luck.|`|5hxWSezPaa	We have life and liberty.

The dream can never die.    America is a country founded on the principle of everyone can achieve great things.  All you have to do is work/sacrifice for it.  The government can't steal your pride.  Nor, will we allow it to steal away our property.     I love the American dream.  It is why I still believe this is a great country w/ a great future.  We just need to remind people of their responsibility to ensure their own success, and be willing to sacrifice those unwilling to help themselves.  (I'd bet they'd get the idea pretty damn quick.)|`|AA12212403	I'm so sorry.  I wish I could say our present occupant of the oval office and his stimulus would fix this for you, but I can't.  What I can do, and have been doing, is to try to buy American products and though we are quite scared about our own situation, we've been trying to buy a few things here and there to stimulate things on our own.  One person CAN make a difference.  I have a glimmer of hope with the appointment of Judd Greg to the cabinet today.  He is a good man.  I have another glimmer of hope with Daschle being out of the picture today as maybe Obama will have some on the job training and bring on board someone who can truly do the job and help bring on some kind of national health plan that works and won't be filling the pockets of politicians.  Let's hope he brings on board an insurance seasoned professional regardless of their political affiliation who won't line their pockets and will get the job done.  Maybe with affordable health care, someone like you and I have a glimmer of hope.  I pray each day for those who are in trouble due to this economy.  I hope that things look up for you soon.|`|3TjiJls7aa	The American Dream is still alive for me.  It means that no matter what, in this country you control where you're going.

The age of majority in Kentucky is 18 but the age you can live outside your parents home is 17 if your parents reported you as a runaway at the age of 17 the police would not intervene.~

Now that was an ugly uniform.    By the way:  The khaki shirt with the black trousers looks like caca.
75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	clearly, the major problem was that banks were allowed to loan money and then not be responsible for whether that money got paid back or not.   that was permitted because of deregulation.     clearly the war was not good.  waging war and not paying for it is just as bad.  it makes way to many of us think it's free.  and it's not.    what we did was, take money from our children to pay for our gullibility.  remember studying the start of the American Revolution in school?  what was the catch phrase?

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	If you son is being charged with common assault he is the one that hit first. He will be fined and maybe ordered to pay any medical expenses for the victim.

Did you have one?|`|aTk0A9SHaa	It's hard to say these days you could do something really minor and petty and go to prison or commit a serious crime and some how get away with it as you see everyday in the papers and news. If your son hasn't been in trouble before then it probably wont be so serious but saying that it has to be quite serious to got to court else he would of got a caution. What has your solicitor said who hit who first was it self defence?|`|B5kUQd3Gaa	As long as he's not mexican he'll be fine. |`|4HkzM23Naa	Dont worry the worse that will happen is that your son will get a fine it was aggrevation so he should be fine if he has never been in trouble for fighting hop your son didnt stab him or something like that.They will most probably just give him a warning and thats it. Good luck hope all goes well|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Leverage had very good advise. Your son's lawyer would be a better source of information that people on YA. We have no idea how serious the assault was, or the circumstances. We don't know the judge or what laws he is accused of breaking.|`|OGWYjsbtaa	A first offence of  common assault is miniscual, he'll get off with a fine and maybe probation.  Bur if he does it again it will be a different story.|`|NePxlTnZaa	Common assault is the lowest grade of assault in British law.    The chances of a custodial sentence for some one of previous good character are next to nil.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	Your son must take advice from the duty solicitor before reaching any decision as to how to plead. The duty solicitor represents people in court accused of criminal offences free of charge. He will be eager to have your son as a client, but if he doesn't take to him particularly, there is no obligation to be represented by him next time round. The fact that it is a charge of common assault makes it appear that any injury was not too serious and there may be some pressure on your son to plead guilty in the hope of getting a lesser sentence, but if he has a genuine defence in the opinion of the solicitor, then he must enter a not guilty plea. He doesn't want to land himself with a criminal record unnecessarily. I am confident that whatever the outcome, he won't be going to prison on this one.
Dxxz5s7Vaa	Depends what you answered yes to.  If it isn't anything serious and you have civilian medical records you should have no problems.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	I love it when some of you new recruits get caught in a lie and blame it on the recruiter. There is no way a recruiter is going to tell anybody to lie or not say anything about something in their past. They can go to jail just the same. And it's three years in prison, not two, plus a $10,000.00 fine.<br>  <br>  Lying to Get Into the Military is a Felony<br>  Let's get straight to the point. Knowingly giving false information or withholding required information on any recruiting form is a criminal offense (When the information would have made an individual ineligible to enlist, or would have required a waiver to enlist). It's not a misdemenor, it's not the same as getting a speeding ticket. It's a felony offense, punishable by a $10,000 fine and three years in prison. If you lie to get into the military, you are committing a felony. It's that simple. If you get away with it long enough to actually enlist, and are caught later, it's also a "military offense." You can be prosecuted for a violation of Article 83 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which states:<br>  <br>  "Any person who-- <br>  <br>  (1) procures his own enlistment or appointment in the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his qualifications for that enlistment or appointment and receives pay or allowances thereunder; or<br>  <br>  (2) procures his own separation from the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his eligibility for that separation; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."|`|tev9SIwIaa	No big deal. The same thing happened to me. As long as your medical records are in good order, and your medical situation won't adversely affect a career in the military, then you should be able to get a waiver for it. That's how it usually works. The worst that'll happen is that it'll delay your processing a bit. That's all.

jIONJZSJaa	I don't know about California, but here in Indiana, they are treated just a little better than a homeless person, but a little worse than a poor and deprived working person.  Rapes still happen in prison.  The amount of freedom they have is determined by what level they are.  Level 1, they are allowed to be in the yard almost the entire day.  Every level they go up, the amount of time spent outside decreases by a few hours.  They are provided with a room and roommate(s).  They can buy a small television if they can afford the $110 for it.  Most can't.  Jobs are available for 15 to 25 cents an hour.  Three meals a day, if you call the food they get to be eatable.<br>  <br>  They are for the most part forced to associate with people that most would never associate with.  Imagine, being locked up for driving while suspended and having to hang out with murders and dope dealers.  Racism is very prominent in the prison system.  Those who came in not racist, have a tendency to leave a racist.  But the hardest thing for most inmates, is when they leave.  66% of them come back within 3 years.  They have tough times finding jobs, no friends or family to back them.  People look at them different, treat them like dirt.  So most fall back into a life of crime.  Its a vicious cycle in our country.  One that the general public and our judical system continues to overlook.<br>  <br>  Hope some of this helps.

JDltTREfaa	You don't provide enough details for me to judge whether or not the officers really did exceed the authorization in the search warrant.<br>  <br>  They are almost certainly allowed to bust the door down if you failed to open the door quickly.  Those officers had no way of knowing if you were destroying evidence or going for a weapon.  Swift entry is necessary for the safety of the officers and preservation of the evidence.<br>  <br>  If the officers found something in a location they were not permitted to search (and assuming they didn't acquire probable cause while they were inside your house), then your attorney would probably be able to get that evidence tossed.|`|voX1bRvNaa	They can force entry a few seconds after announcing their intent unless they have a no knock warrant. The reason for the rush is so evidence is not destroyed. I'm not sure what you mean that they searched for something that wasn't on warrant. They can look any place that the named items could be-you can look in a drawer for a stolen ring but not a stolen elephant. Anything they observe during that search that is evident as contraband or stolen can be seized even if not named on the warrant.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	It's referred to as "fruit of the poisonous tree."

Glass-Steagall was initially enacted, in reaction to the Depression, to establish the FDIC and to provide a 'wall' between banks and risk-based investment firms.  Killing the provisions that separated the banks from investment houses allowed the sub-prime mortgages to be bundled and sold as fraudulently rated 'exotics' to be passed throughout, and to contaminate, the banking AND speculative investment market pool.

She doesn't have to keep the child but why kill a baby because of the actions of someone else. I would keep my child even if I was raped.|`|SaxjkMbSaa	I am not convinced whether this is a sincere question or whether it is another anti-life pro-choice  question  however one solution would be to have the baby and put the baby up for adoption in as much as there are many couples who are incapable of having children of their own and would love to adopt a baby.|`|IUXriZQJaa	So you would murder the second victim of the rape?<br>  You assign a child the death penalty for the crimes of his or her father? How could you?<br>  First, it is extremely rare for a rape victim's body to allow fertilization, and it would have to be timed right, when she is in estrus, so I doubt you are telling the truth.<br>  Nothing is worse for a rape victim, though, who gets pregnant, than an abortion. <br>  Nothing.|`|tDZMJue9aa	perhaps you should let her decide that for herself and not try to make me feel guilty so i make it for you and if you are asking people on the internet perhaps you should see the same doctor for some meds|`|YIWKPXokaa	Just be thankful this did not happen in Alaska.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	no|`|IGbEZZlraa	No she should not.

Good luck sweetie!!!!!!!!!|`|BpcgaJd4aa	They see it as harmless and a stupid law to begin with.|`|lzDalUfaaa	BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW IT SHOULD BE LEGAL<br>  <br>  BUT THE MORON REPUBLICANS DECIDED THAT THEY WERE ALLOWED TO CONTROL OUR LIVES IN EVERY ASPECT!<br>  AND THEN THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO CALL OBAMA A "SOCIALIST"|`|UjXQriuKaa	i think alot of pla ces its not illegal to smoke only to sell|`|n7T6ANopaa	Why do people cross the street at places other the crosswalks?<br>  <br>  The world may never know.
3PdBGesIaa	in state prison you can request veggie meals ,or kosher meals,<br>  and there are a lot of O.C.D's in prison ,but you have to be super clean while you are locked up because of all of the germs and stuff,you can buy sanitizer wipes on the can tine to clean with ,you can wash your own cloths if you want ,you would be amazed at how many people you see cleaning their floors ,walls ,cloths ,beds,10 times a day because they are scared of germs and dirt,and plus they keep it cold in prison to keep the germs down anyway<br>  <br>  <br>  and with the cloths . have to wear an under shirt (white)before you leave your cell,and some prisons make you wear jump suits or button up shirts ,depends on the prisons dress code,and if you fall under the grandfather clause (been locked up since before 1988)you are allowed to wear your own personal cloths as long as it was blue or denim|`|EgdR7cfTaa	don't go to jail....their not going to cater to your diet or OCD....<br>  <br>  sidenote:  its not that hard to get arrested...not everyone in jail is a career criminal.  it just takes one bad situation or decision at the wrong time|`|H4MILKhcaa	Don't do anything that will get you placed in Jail. <br>  <br>  Vegetarian meals can be provided to you. Kleenex will be your only option and your clothing issues are to weird to be taken seriously. <br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Jails are required to make adjustments for religious diets.  If you are vegetarian for non-religious reasons, they don't have to accommodate you, but I've heard that most jails serve vegetarian food, not because they want to but because it's cheaper.  Meat is a rare luxury to most inmates.  <br>  <br>  The OCD, you're just going to learn to have to deal with.|`|AA10925759	Not nuts enough for a mental institute. <br>  <br>  You would just end up in jail or prison and that would be not so nice. <br>  <br>  Ethical reasons. You have shoes, clothing, a belt, wallet and all of that? Do you drive a car? The judge would not buy it.|`|AA11083526	Good luck, there are no vegetarian options at our county jail, and if you are OCD then you will probably die. Have you ever used the restroom, or taken a shower when someone is watching you? Are you used to wearing the same clothes for a week? If not, then don't get in trouble.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	If you go to jail, the other inmates will steal all your food anyways, because vegitarians are too weak to defend themselves.<br>  <br>  However, this may work to your advantage.  Just give all your meat to a big black gal who stabbed her husband.  In return she will protect you.|`|WZrXnqmSaa	While this may get all thumbs down, I think your only option is to be your cell mates' [insert deragotory phrase here].<br>  <br>  I mean, you can clean up after her all day long and she can take the meat from your trays. I don't think she'd have a problem with that.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, I think you'd need to learn to like meat in jail because if you don't eat all your food and start giving it away, other inmates may view you as weak and make you a target.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could say you can't eat meat for religeous reasons and they could work something out. (???????)<br>  <br>  Not to come off harsh, but this is the way I view it.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	You would have to learn to adjust.  You would have to either learn to eat meat, or you would have to only eat the side dishes that do not include meat.  They will not cater to your preference of being a vegetarian.  The only way they would cater to a person's diet is if they have a medical note from a doctor stating they have to eat only certain things.  A doctor would not give a note to a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  You would not be placed in a mental institution for being OCD.  You would have to deal with your anxiety, but they would probably assign you a psychologist that can help you.
T8nap2Pnaa	If you're in the US and you're still in the middle of adjusting status, you need to apply for Advance Parole through USCIS. If you get it, you can leave and return legally. If you leave without it, you won't be able to get back in until you get an immigrant visa.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Please send an email to find out the right procedure.
