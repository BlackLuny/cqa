vkzkXWfzaa	The classic student SLR camera is the Pentax K1000, made since 1976 and only finished production in 1998 making it the longest production run of any 35mm SLR. There are thousands available on the second hand market cheaply, in 2001 I bought one still in its original box still with cellophane around it for less than 100.00 - bargain.    Its about as simple as an SLR can get, fully mechanical, with TTL metering, built like a tank. Together with any K mount lens (again thousands available) you have a formidable combination for very little money.

However, there are a ton of SLRs from the 60's, 70's, and 80's that are all quite suitable. Ricoh made nice cameras, as did Pentax as someone mentioned already.    Lenses are more important than the camera body. So look for lenses in your area (or online if you know how to recognize faults) to make sure you have access to good ones. I don't have first-hand experience with a lot of lenses, but if you want to know, a prime lens with 50 or 55mm focal length will be best for general-purpose shooting. Zoom lenses are less sharp all-in-all. 1.8 or 1.4 maximum aperture are very good, too.    I don't know your level of expertise in the subject, so I don't want to go on giving you a whole lecture. I wanted to include the most important topics for assurance, though. One more thing...If you get a camera from eBay or elsewhere online, make sure any necessary repairs aren't going to be expensive. Get a perfectly-functioning camera if possible because repairs for old cameras these days can be far more expensive than the camera itself.|`|3TqPF1zMaa	My pick would be a used Nikon F4.

rWlvnhYuaa	It would depend on how fast technology advances and if you tend to like the graphics intensive games. As the programming and hardware get more complicated older systems will fail to be able to render them.      But yeah, replacing PCs for gamers tends to be at least every 3 years if not sooner.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	It's going to depend largely on what games you want to play.    With a bit of intelligent selection in terms of hardware on your part, you can do a lot to extend your PC's usefulness for gaming.    My last PC was going on 6 or 7 years before I finally upgraded it.  Then again, I don't really play graphics intensive FPS games very often.  (I've yet to play Doom 3 - HAH!)    There's also nothing wrong with having a gaming PC as well as a game console - in fact that's a very smart move as it gives you access to a wider variety of games, while also giving you a choice of which platform to buy a game for if it's available for both.    PCs are still the king for both RTS and turn-based strategy games.  These often don't have super-high requirements in terms of hardware, like FPS games do.    A decent, moderately high-end PC should only cost you around $1200-1500 depending largely on the video card you choose.  I honestly don't see a reason to drop $200 or more on a video card.  It's a lot easier - and cheaper - to just buy a lower-end card and just upgrade later on.  Sure, you may not be able to play Crysis immediately, but it's not as though the game's going to disappear or anything.  And in a year or 2, those "bleeding edge" cards that cost $400 or $500 will be out performed by cards costing $100.    The same thing goes for the games themselves, too. Don't be a rush to buy the latest and greatest game - they're often just not worth the money.  Wait awhile and the prices will come down.  Console games can also be bought used, which can save you even more money.  I personally won't pay more than $20-30 for a game - ANY GAME.  At those prices, I can buy 2 or 3 titles for the price of today's latest release.|`|7ba4e9080232680f7f813532b17e14eeaa	not if you put the money out to but a good pcthen no u wont have to replace it|`|AA12358300	Depending on what game you want to play.

A good fast motherboard will last longer than 3 years and since everything else attaches to this components can be upgraded, which is allot cheaper.

XM vs. the iPodWill XM's new portable satellite radio make the iPod obsolete?  By Paul Boutin  Posted Tuesday, Oct. 26, 2004, at 6:53 PM ET    Listen to this story on NPR's Day to Day Listen to this story on NPR's Day to Day.    Apple Computer and XM Radio both unveiled hot, next-generation portable music players this morning. Apple's upgraded iPod Photo has 60 gigs of storage capacity, a color screen, and new software that lets you bloat it with photos as well as music. (Cost: $499 for the 40-gig model, $599 for the 60-gig version.) XM's new MyFi player is, in short, the first satellite radio Walkman. It can tune into 130-plus channels of digital radio and even store five hours of programming for you to play back at your leisure. (Cost: $349.99, plus $9.99 per month for an XM subscription.)    My instant take on today's game of whiz-bang one-upmanship is that both companies lost. It's now five hours after Apple's U2-bedecked press conference, and I still haven't stopped yawning. This new iPod Photo is the same iPod we're already sick of hearing about. The 2-inch color screen isn't the start of any digital revolutionall it does is turn your iPod into a camera phone that can't take pictures or make phone calls.    XM's MyFi isn't as disappointing as a gadget. Just a week ago, I was wondering why there wasn't a satellite radio that I could wear on my hip. Now there is one. If you're sick of the songs on your iPod or the crappy stations on the local FM dial, MyFi gives you 130 channels to flip through.              A Quick Guide to Satellite Radio  Tired of the same old stations on your radio dial? Tuning in to satellite radio might be the perfect solution.  Helmut Kobler  Tuesday, September 28, 2004 01:00 AM PDT    Chances are you have a love-hate relationship with conventional radio. Sure, you probably appreciate radio's steady stream of music, news, and sports broadcasts. Plus, there's radio's alluring mystery factor--you never know what you might hear when you tune in. (Bet you can't say that about the old, familiar playlists in your MP3 player!)    Unfortunately, it's easy to forget all that as soon as you consider the flip side of radio: the endless surfing through a handful of stations, staticy reception, and steady flow of obnoxious commercials.    Enter satellite radio, the antidote to conventional AM/FM radio's most annoying traits. Sure, it involves mastering more tech gadgetry, and unlike your father's radio, it's not free. On the other hand, it offers great reception, tons of music and special-interest stations, and stations that transmit not just music, but handy text information, like sport scores and stock quotes. So how does this all work, and how much will you have to pay? Read on--we'll take a look at the benefits, how much it costs, and how to pick out the equipment that's right for you.

58e661b9b1cea54ea1305400c3f2f904aa	It depends on whether you are talking about a Cingular Corporate Store, a Cingular Exclusive Dealer and a Cingular Independent Dealer.  Using my area as an example, all the Cingular Corporate Stores have a payment machine somewhere in the store that will take a payment through an ATM style machine where you enter your phone number and your zip code.  It will then pull your account up and show you the remaining balance and due date.  Once you tell it you want to make the payment, again in our area, the machine asks you if you want to make the payment by credit card, check, or cash.  If you pay by cash you will put the money in (no change is given) and it will tally it up as you load it.  Once you have put how much you want to pay, the machine will then print a reciept and that is it.  At an Exclusive Store and Independent Store it really depends on the dealer.  There are programs available for dealers to be able to take payments but unlike the Corporate store where there are no extra charges, the dealers have an extra fee (that is how they make their money) they charge you for that convienience.  Now you may be wondering how to tell the difference between the stores.  The independent stores will usually carry more than just Cingular and have their store name on the building.  The Exclusive stores will have cingular all over the store and building but right at the front door somewhere it will say "Owned and Operated by .......".  Corporate stores will look identical except that they will say "Owned and Operated by Cingular Wireless".|`|94950d3131569efcb8152c4d91671171aa	If you go to the store they will take cash and credit NO CHECK.....hope that answers it|`|c3ad288725e89e6df16d12e392e5789baa	GET A RECEIPT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So much resolution is lost to noise, and their tiny lenses fail to gather light very well compared to proper cameras.  You need a good OPTICAL zoom number, like 10x, 12x or 18x, not a high DIGITAL zoom number, which just makes a blurry image bigger!        What we need is not phones trying to be cameras, but cameras (my Panasonic Lumix super-zoom camera has a lovely large Leica lens, and takes GREAT pictures) which are also usable as phones...

j5Apt8hWaa	Insomniac is correct and here is more detail    Formatting a memory card:    Regularly format a memory card to help prevent it from becoming corrupted. Formatting, also known as initializing, overwrites everything on a card including protected images, directories and camera data, and sets up new folders and data on the card. To help ensure the integrity of the folders and data, it's important to format the card using your camera, not computer!    A new memory card should ALWAYS be formatted BEFORE use, in its parent camera.  Many users of P&S cameras experience card errors IF they have never formatted the card.  Formatting after each use cycle (shoot, copy to computer, format), you should never have card problems.    From  http://www.digicamhelp.com|`|AA10722993	You will find format in your menu.   Just be sure to upload any pictures to your computer first, as formatting erases all pictures.  When you get a new card, format it.

AA11474133	Are you talking about the utility's transformer?  I doubt it is 15A (where did you get that?).  It might be 15kVA.  In any case, utilities commonly use smaller transformers and wires than the national electrical code requires for services (or are commonly put in for services), because they know real loads are smaller than that.  Around here, many new homes get 200A services (even though 150A or less would be the code requirement).  The utility uses 25kVA transformers most of the time, which is a bit more than 100A, and serves several of these "200A" houses with it.  They know what they are doing, and it isn't a problem.    Why are you asking?  Are you having some kind of problem?

As someone else mentioned somewhere all pre-orders will be fulfilled first. If any shop happens to get new stock imagine all the campers who'll sleep in front of the stores or the chaos and then within minutes all will be gone.    Another option - a very secure and reliable one which least know of actually - is to purchase a Nintendo Wii thru any trusted 3rd party seller directly at Amazon. They have good feedback, deliver on time, mostly are merchants themselves simply and Amazon operates as the platform, in fact the purchase is processed directly via Amazon as you would usually buy from them.     You might check it out at     http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...     and then click on "See all buying options" at the right.    This is actually currently the best choice to get your hands on a Wii at all - without any hassles.     You might also try out ebay:    http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-1751-2...    or Ebay express where only selected and trusted merchants are accepted:    http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-1751-2...

Also, if the Wiimote came with your system, you must give it a few seconds to sync with the Wii console once you have turned it (the system) on. If you have a new controller, you must use the sync feature on the back of the controller and by the SD card slot.

Curiosamente, o assunto ventilado remete a uma altera??o um tanto quanto recente no tocante  rela??o consumidor/operadora na presta??o de servi?os de telefonia mvel celular.    No ltimo dia 27, a Anatel na reni?o 444, criou uma srie de regras que ampliou consideravelmente os direitos dos consumidores de servi?os de telefonia mvel.    Segundo o Regulamento do Servi?o Mvel Pessoal, a validade dos crditos nos planos pr-pagos passou a ser de 180 dias (para determinados "cart?es"), o que confere um prazo maior para o cliente utilizar os crditos adquiridos.    Outra altera??o cria dois prazos:  1o de 30 dias para, no caso de vencido os crditos, bloqueio de liga??es;  2o de 60 dias para, passado o primeiro prazo, ocorrer a rescis?o do contrato (cancelamento da linha).    ASSIM, considerando que tanto o prazo de validade dos crditos, quanto  possiblidade de rescis?o do contrato serem legais, nos termos da legisla??o editada pela ANATEL, a princpio, a atitude da referida operadora apresenta-se normal.    Quanto  segunda pergunta: Indeniza??o?  - a indeniza??o surge no momento em que ocorre uma les?o decorrente de um ilcito. A pergunta ent?o : existe ilcito?    Bom, vimos que no tocante  rescis?o, a princpio, n?o h ilcito.  Vejamos quanto  forma de cobran?a:  1. O Cdigo de Defesa do Consumidor prev que nenhuma cobran?a poder expor o consumidor  situa??o vexatria.  2. O envio de Mensagens de Texto leva a situa??o vexatria?    Bom, acho que o bom senso responde  tal pergunta.    Querendo pesquisar a respeito  www.anatel.gov.br      Espero ter ajudado.  Abra?os|`|BStVlzo6aa	eletr?nicamente  impossivel eles desligarem o seu celular,  so podem tirar a linha  voc poderar usar a camera dele tranquilamente, acredite nisso experiencia propia|`|SXw8mmE7aa	Aioooh  Cobrinha,    Os crditos tm prazo de validade.  Aps gastos ou passado esse prazo voc n?o poder mais fazer liga??es, mas ainda fica podendo receber liga??es por um perodo (que eu n?o sei qual ).    Ocorre que mesmo para voc s receber liga??es isso traz custos para a operadora.  Ent?o sejamos conscientes, n?o d pr gente querer que a linha fique ativa com o servi?o de receber liga??o  a vida toda sem pagar nada s operadoras.  Se n?o ia ser assim, o cara compra um celular e  com crdito de R$5,00 e fica o resto da vida com esse servi?o. Algum tem que pagar essa conta, Cobrinha!    Quanto a constrangimento, n?o vejo assim. A operadora est outra vez te prestando um servi?o, ela est te avisando e te dando a oportunidade de manter a sua linha, caso seja do seu interesse.    N?o trabalho em operadora, mas acredito que a tica tambm se aplica nas rela??es comerciais.    Abra?os para a galera do YR.    Valter C.

Por si no ers el caso te puedo sugerir 2 cosas:  1a: usa el boton de hold (proteccion) que esta en la parte superior. Bloquealo e inmediatamente desbloquealo, y prueba a ver si tu zune enciende. A mi me funciono despues de que el aparato cayo de una altura aprox. de 1 metro y no se encendia.  2a: Tambien puedes resetear el aparato. Obviamente se te borrara todo el contenido, pero lo puedes volver a sincronizar. Para resetearlo debes oprimir el boton de la izquierda y, sin soltarlo, oprimir el boton superior de la rueda central (el de subir el volumen).   Espero que algo de esto te funcione.  Suerte.

Et tant qu'a faire, il te le faudrait de bonne qualite...|`|1147f6bc5b79333d10353a380f9a13f3aa	Mon cher ami,slon le type de materil que tu cherche, je suis certain que tu es un mordu de la vido,ou que tu fait des montages vido ou tu travail sur ton compte,dans le domaine de la vido en free lance(par exemple les mariages). Bon,je rviens  ta question: Oui bien sur ?a existe c'est que tu  cherche mais sans avoir le TNT integr,par contre il en possede un tuner interband et hyper band,pour rcvoir les cha?nes par cable ou par antenne ou par un distribuiteur provenant de plusieurs satelites TPS ,Canal Satelite,c'est que tu n'auras plus besoin de TNT.Par contre pour faciliter  ta reflexion d? au fait que tu specifie de preference pas cher, je te donne la marque et la reference qui fabrique le magnetoscope numerique ,avec graveur dvd et disque dur integr ,donc 3 en 1, tu as eu une trs bonne orientation je voit ,je t'incline mon chapeau pour cela,mais pour le prix! tu veras toi tout seul si tu peut ngocier.Donc le materiel que tu as besoin est  la marque JVC(d'ailleurs pour l'instant est le seul constructeur au monde qui a fabriqu ce type de produit de 3 en 1 sur la mme carcase, un magnetoscope numerique qui accepte les casettes mini dv et le mini dvcam,pour ta grande surprise,accepte les dvcam aussi,ensuite un disque dure de 250 Go et un graveur de dvd qui prend en charge mme les dvd ram et le dvd -rw.Pass mal non ? Donc marque JVC model :SR DVM 700 EU,pourquoi il ferras ton grand bonheur ? il possede aussi une entr en fire wire qui est compatible avec le disque dur en entr et en sortie,avec le mini dv et avec le graveur de dvd,un autre option que va te plaire beaucoup  ce model d'ailleurs le seul pour l'europe en PAL ,pour les tats unies 2 models ,difference uniquement de disque dur de 40 GO et de 250 GO. Donc pour les casettes mini dv,est capable d'enregistrer 80 minutes en mode normal et en longue play 120 minutes,une bonne perce ,car les sony dhr-1000 max 60 minutes avec les mini dv et pas de longue play ,mais avec les casettes dv  120 minutes et 180 minutes,mais c'est un materiel beaucoup trop performant qui depasse celui ci de jvc que jt'ai propos,mais il n'est plsu fabriquer et que d'ailleurs j'ai et je vais vendre bient?t sur ebay.  mais pour la version de vhs et dvd dans une mme unit c'est mme pas la peine que je te le dise car tu voit ?a dans tous les magaisns que soit  la fnac ou darty et carrefour aussi.par contre si tu prend la 2 m option ,parceque te reviens moins cher ,je te conseille de prendre s-vhs avec le graveru du dvd. Par contre  longue terme t'es plus gangnant avec la premiere option que tu as choisi le JVC SR DVM 700EU,pourquoi  longue terme ? parceque est capable de lire aussi le mini dvcam format proffessionel -industriel,comme celui-ci du grand publique la mini dv. Et si tu veut frapper encore plus fort , du vhs  dvd ,je te conseille le D-VHS  DVD toujours la marque de JVC,le modl HM-DT100 U via le fire wire,mme si n'est pas une casette D-VHS ,tu utilise une casette vhs ,l'appareil mme integre un convertisseur pour transformer le signal analogue ,provenant de la k7 vhs  la prise fire wire, ensuite li  un graveur de dvd ou disque dur,sans avoir aucune perte et cela d'une k7 vhs tu t'imagine ? Mais mon cher ami, reflechi avant d'investir ,si l'investissement vaut ou pas la peine, n'attend pas pour les graveurs HD DVD ou le BLUE RAY, ils sont prvu pour le grand publique pas avant le 2010 ,ils ont de rtard mme dans le domaine proffessionel. j'espere que mes conseils te seront utiles ,avec les references que je viens te donner tu pourras faire de recherches sur le net,donc c'est qui feras ton affaire est : le JVC reference SR DVM 700 Eu pour l'Europe uniquement. Quant pour le bonus que tu demande ,d'avoir si possible une liaison wifi ou usb avec le pc,eh bien pour cela mon cher ami je doit te dire que tu n'est pas exigeant du tout ,si doit juger ! c'est n'est que les constructeurs d'lctronique qui ont du rtard ,le usb est dja disponible sur certains graveurs de dvd grand publique actuellement , comme par exmemple le graveur le dvr 530 de Pioneer avec graveur de dvd et disque dur,mais ils ont enlev les prises fire wire en echange ,c'est que je n'accepte pas du tout et en tant que professionel ,pour moi la prise fire wire doit toujours exister et avec le signal en sortie et entre.pour c'est qui est de wifi,pas encore cher ami,tu comprendras a travers de l'exemple  quel point mme le dvd a eu du retard se democratiser et quand on entend les gens que les technologies voluent trop rapide, tu as la possibilit soit en tant que amateur soit en tant que proffessionel de constater que c'est faux,que les technologies avance trop rapide,j'attend le graveur de HD DVD ou de BLUE RAY ,version de salon haut de gamme ou version proffessionel pour m'en doter d'une unit,depuis presque 3 ans.Donc tes exigences concernant le bonus,ne sont pas a critiquer du tout ,?a prouve que les constructeurs ne sont pas capable de se tenir  la vitesse des proffessionels comme moi ou possiblement comme toi,car c'est pas n'importe qui ,qui cherche un appareil comme toi avec tous les caracteristiques que tu as demand dans ta question.

bd5Lu0W2aa	just go to walmart and buy a pre paid one, then call them and they will activate it on your contract. The phones are the same thing you get if you sign a contract and a lot cheeper because the reduce the price to get people to buy the pre paid ones. So anywhere from $15 to $150    the only way they will know that it was ment for pre pay is if you tell them , so dont tell them.|`|KQeAx469aa	You need to buy one from your cell phone provider. They maybe able to use one of their prepaid cell phones but you'll want to check because not all company's can. You need one of their phone's because it has the programming for which cell phone tower is there's and which is someone else's. I would expect to pay about $200-300 for a basic phone.

What is happening to this world? Your 11 and want a cell phone? I know 16 year olds who's parents live 40 minutes from the school and if they miss their bus they are out of luck until their parents can come pick them up.     And you know her income is dropping, that maybe they can't afford it right now, and yet all you can think about is yourself and what you want.     If you were told your getting a phone in november then that when you get your phone. November is a long ways away. Maybe you can ask again in September. But guess what sugar? everybody before you has managed to get through without a cell phone. You will to.    And why do you need a fancy phone? Any crappy phone will work if you ever need to call your mommy. I had a cr@ppy phone until I bought and nice one myself.
KiVENZoBaa	I would definitely buy Okami.   why?    Not only that it got a 9.5 rating out of 10, but because of the story line and the game play. Its pretty similar to The Legend of Zelda games. Solving puzzles, defeating enemies, side missions, items and equipment, skipping scenes, and the health gage seems pretty similar as well.    What really blew me away was using the Wii remote to use Okami's brush techniques. You can point and drag a brush to defeat demons or help out villagers with their problems. There are about 13 brush techniques, each containing special element powers (fire, water, air, etc). There are plenty of things you can do in this game. Its pretty long. So I would strongly recommend you get this game.     Plus, I can help you out if you get stuck, since I passed the game if you wish. =)    No comment on Medal of Honor 2 Heroes.|`|X8IBVfpwaa	you should get call of duty world at war instead of medal of honor|`|pmppurDAaa	Get Okami, I totally recommend you get it. Its a great game! Seriously!    King boo Can kiss my @SS!! You suck!!!|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	Well if depend on what your into.  If you like adventures games like The Legend Of Zelda than you should get Okami   but  if you like shooter games that are first person and like playing online than get Medal of honor heroes 2    In my opinion Okami is better.|`|2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	Okami is an excellent game.    And it's only $25  :D|`|ahuFrmWQaa	get Okami it got better ratings!  Okami got 9 out of 10 and Medal Of Honor 2 Heroes got a 8 out of 10|`|MBkuUf24aa	i know this isn't on your list, but i think call of duty world at war is better then both of them. if you dont want that then yes get MOHH2!! that game is really fun! when i frist played it i wouldn't stop!   (well online anyways) single is fun to, but online is always better!      i dont like okami. it just...sucks XD|`|o8NVWaJgaa	If you haven't gotten Okami for PS2, get it for the Wii. It is like Zelda, an adventure game with bosses, side quests, and secrets. This is one of the best games ever. Since its $25.00 at GameStop too is really great. If you haven't even played Okami for a little bit, Okami for the Wii is a definite buy.

lkqjJisaaa	On yor Canon XS....presuming you have an 18-55mm lens and no other lens...    1) set lens to 55mm  2) set aperture to f/5.6 (camera should be in Tv mode).  3) keep cat close to lens  4) keep objects in background further away, as far as you can.    If you have a 55-200mm lens, use that one instead and try to set zoom to 100mm or bigger.|`|oq6ofi72aa	You can try putting it in aperture priority or manual mode.  Just make sure the aperture is at its lowest number (widest hole-lets more light in).  The shutter speed does not matter.|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	Quite easy--but you need a little bit of knowledge about depth of field.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_fi...    See different settings of the aperture?     http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...    Practical usage here:      http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...    http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...|`|lADgq9p0aa	The depth of field depends on (1) focal length of the lens (2) aperture of the lens and (3) the distance to the subject.    To get shallow depth of field, use a longer focal length lens e.g. 200mm.  Select a wide aperture (e.g. f/2.8) and have the subject close to the camera and background far from the camera.

hQf0BwT2aa	Pretty sure that your line voltage has ZIP to do with it.  A bad or corroded connection is most likely your culprit.  You sound like you know enough about what is going on.    Any static will screw you up as well.  Check the init strings on your modem set up as well.  It has been way long since I dealt with dial up but there are tweaks on the modem to help.  Try to "google"  init string settings.  There is web site out there that will give you tweaks for your modem.    Good luck!
BsV2TQAvaa	Well, there's no reason why you can just copy it straight from the camera to the memory stick. Then you can skip the step of copying it to the computer disk and deleting it again. If its for privacy reasons, you should know that once something has been copied to your hard drive, it can sometimes be recovered even after it has been deleted. So why not skip that step?|`|x43Pj22Aaa	Yes.    Once it is on your computer it is a digital file and can be put onto any storage medium.  The videos are .avi files wrapped in the 3ivx codec.  The flip camera itself is essentially a flash drive, you can even put other types of files onto the flip.  When you plug it into your computer just go to My Computer and you will see your flip listed as a drive.    I use StashSpace.Com a video storage service to backup my flip videos.  Check them out at http://www.stashspace.com.
REiPASTSaa	No you can't do that.    Invest in a router, and then split the modem signal to your computer and Xbox.    You can get a decent router for about 30 dollars.|`|tgT5MAO5aa	Actually yes, through a wireless laptop, plug the Ethernet into your xbox and laptop and make sure the laptop can connect to the internet and you can connect that way. I dont know for sure but I imagine if you had a desktop and wireless receiver via USB and not the Ethernet port then that might work.(dont hold me to it). Either way you need wireless to connect through a computer.

People have tried all sorts of things the only one I know of that kinda works is to cover your whole body with a neoprene diving suit, these hold the body heat in, at least until the whole suit warms up above the PIR's threshold (about 5 minutes).

5mglrsNsaa	You're not gonna like this very much!! The bluetooth on the iPhone is actually for use of headsets only. Pictures, music, videos, nothing else can be exchanged through bluetooth. It is a big issue, but Apple didn't want to allow sending of music to avoid their Digital Rights locking of their songs to be at threat. Why pictures can not be sent, I haven't the faintest idea. I'm afraid it's not possible, and the only way to do it is to exchange pictures over the internet, the put on your iPhone afterwards.
EfejPjIMaa	I'm not sure what you mean by "get it".  BD-Live is an interaction feature on Blu-ray players that allow you to go "Beyond" the movie.  The latest firmware update for any Blu-ray player (this includes the PS3) will allow BD-Live content to be displayed.  Not all Blu-ray movies are BD-Live compatible.      Here is the official BD-Live site: http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/bl...    Here is the link showing the PS3 was BD-Live enabled in March of 2008: http://www.us.playstation.com/News/Press...    As long as you have the latest firmware update (2.20 or above) then your PS3 is BD-Live enabled.|`|UphoLYGYaa	BD-Live is not something you select. You dont "go" to it like Home or Internet or a game.  To use BD-Live you need a blu-ray movie that has that feature, Transformers, Ironman, Dark Knight are examples.  On the bonus features on those discs you can access bd live features.  The content is going to depend on the movie, but there are things like downloadable menu skins (Transformers) and for the Dark Knight they had a session where you could watch the movie and and chat live with the director chris nolan

Ur6H8gwkaa	If your receiver decodes standard dolby 5.1 and dts 6.1 you are fine.    Both Dolby and dts claim that their new HD codecs have a 'legacy' core, meaning that the old surround standard is at the heart of these new sound codecs.    You'll get the old dolby or dts surround at max bit rate, so the sound will still rock as the old dts max bit rate was 1.5Mb per second.    No worries.|`|AA10012988	does your receiver have optical in?

If your old receiver has 5.1 analog multi-channel inputs, you should buy a Blu-ray player with 7.1 analog multi-channel outputs which will be connected to your receiver to get HD audio. Optical or coaxial digital cables are not compatible with HD sound formats.|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	Depends on the inputs you reciever has
BsV2TQAvaa	Sounds pretty sure that you have an antenna problem.  Are you close enough to a broadcast stations to pick up regular broadcast now? If you live in a city, chances are strong that there are already several digital stations you can pick up. I live 20 miles out of Philadelphia and can pick up 25 digital stations.  If you live in a very rural area, its possible no one is broadcasting digitally yet but this is unlikely.     Its also possible your converter box is defective.     Good luck.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Do you have any sort of an antenna (rabbit ears, etc.) connected to the converter box?  The converter box is just a tuner - it still needs an antenna of some sort.    It could also be that the antenna you're using isn't strong enough to pick up the digital stations.  Digital transmissions have a much shorter range compared to the analog ones.|`|2LrB58M7aa	Just buy a new T.V and avoid all the confusion.
Dso7k3sjaa	You can find it here:    http://www.simbology.com/smf/    Before you get it there are a few threads that you should read so you make sure you get the correct version that's made to work with the games you have installed and so you know what the 'flavor paks' are that you can add to go along with the hack.    So, I recommend reading this thread first:    http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php/t...    Basically, it explains that the stuff packs can change the game coding, so if you have say, The Sims 2 Double Deluxe but nothing else, then even though the latest released ep is Nightlife, because you have Celebrations also, then you need the version made to work with OFB. That's why I tell people to read that thread.  In your case, you probably need to get the one that works with Bon Voyage -- but read it anyway just to make sure you don't have a stuff pack installed that might require a different one.    Then, after you are sure which version you need to download, then you should read this thread next. It has three posts on it and the first and second posts are the most important to read. Especially the second post which talks about the 'flavor paks' because it explains that some of the 'flavor paks' are not compatible with other ones. So you will have to choose which ones you want to use (if any) and then make sure they do not conflict with each other before you put them into your game. Otherwise, it can mess things up. Okay, here's the thread I'm talking about:    http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php/t...    Oh, and if you do decide that you want to add one or more of the 'flavor paks' and you download the file that says it has them for the version you want, make sure you put it on your desktop and open it before you put it into your game because ALL of the 'flavor paks' are in that one download. So, you need to open it and delete the ones that you are not going to use and then move it into your downloads folder.    Now here is the actual link to get the hack and the 'flavor pak' that goes with it:    http://www.simbology.com/mods/index.php?...    One more thing. In case you don't know how to open zip folders and where to put them after you get them open, then you can read this link to learn:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.  http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...  http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h... ...    What gives a camera its picture quality?    It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential output size, not image quality.     The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.    http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5... ...  http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po... ...    There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.       For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)     This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ... It's PINK, but it uses a $49.50 Series G Rechargeable 960mAh lithium-ion battery.  http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber... ...  http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/defau... ...     CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.     Lots of great camera tips in this link.   http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...     My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic.      Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.  Once you select a camera, read all about it in the owner's manual.  You can view owners manuals at this link, but will need to Login. http://www.retrevo.com/s/digital+camera ...

4Pk6VNftaa	First, the Wii doesn't support HD, at all.  The best it can do is 480p, also called Progressive Scan, but only if you use its component video cables.  Even this is not     Second, the only cables that support HD are:  HDMI - single cable carrying both digital audio and HD video.  Connectors look like a small, thin rectangle.    Component video - has 3 RCA connectors colored Red, Blue, and Green which are for the video signal, and an additional 2 RCA connectors colored Red and White for stereo audio.  Component video is also capable of carrying a progressive scan signal, but this isn't considered HD.    Other cables include s-video (black connector with 4 pins sticking out of it) and composite video (yellow RCA cable)  neither of these support HD at all.|`|biXnRYMpaa	Hey buddy. I work in appliances and tvs. Of course the TVs of today are now HD. On the back of your TV is a panel to plug in your component cables or even your HDMI cables. HD Component cables will be the Green, Blue, and Red cables. And then you can plug the Red and White audio cables in beside them. There should be a place to plug all that stuff in on the back of the Wii as well i think.  The cables you have are most likely not HD. The HD Component cables are usually going to cost about $40 but it's well worth the investment. Trust me. Hit me back brother.
w4I9oj2Maa	Depends on physical size...Look at the cost of the TV set. Now, add $100 more to that cost and you have the cost of the LCD panel    Remember, the SUM of the separate parts is more than the Whole TV set due to warehousing costs added on to them.

lkqjJisaaa	Two big differences.    The more expensive one is internal focusing and also has a built-in lens motor.  The more expensive one is a newer internal lens design, and it doesn't need the aspheric elements.    The best lens, without regard to price, is the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8.  It's way better than either of these lenses, and well worth the extra money.  If you can't afford that much, take a look at the Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 lens as well as these Sigma lenses.  Note also that even the older Nikon 28-70mm f/2.8 lens is still quite expensive, even used.    I happen to also have a Tokina 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, but it's soft when shot at f/2.8 and doesn't sharpen up until f/4.    Oh, and your links don't work.  Try http://www.sigmaphoto.com for better descriptions of the lenses.    edit: further checks.  New lens may have aspheric elements, but just not advertising them.    Empenage is wrong again.  Tokina was founded by former Nikon engineers and has a good reputation for build quality. And since I B usin' Nikon, Tokina, Sigma, and Tamron lenses, I can say that Sigma lenses, while good, have a slight color cast to them compared to Nikons which are more neutral.  His amateur experience means he don' know what he's talkin' about.  And he always thumbs down everyone elses answer.  Again, that less expensive lens is half the price because the expensive one has a built-in motor, internal focusing, a new internal lens design...and new lens elements.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	if you're only an amatuer and do'nt depend on photography to make a living. the aspherical will be a decent lens. i have a sigma 55-200 for my canon and it got a good review from dpreview.com, which you should look at. i've been an amatuer photographer for a long time, and since the early days of 35mm, the order for aftermarket lenses has always been 1.

Here is all the information    Downside is you get charged for incoming text.. @ teen, your friends will Text you... So maybe if you are a light texter... start off with the 250 for $5... then if you feel like you use it alot more then upgrade.    I'm 16 and I pretty much text everyday... I'm a little use texter... maybe around 150 a month so keep in mind unless you are chatting with text... then 250 should be enough for short communication.    Telus' Voice rate is cheap... Classic $0.25 like a good ol' payphone.    I recommend either LG Venus or LG Keybo~ both very great phones   Keybo is @ 179.99 with $50 activation credit... so it's really $129.99    LG Venus is 129.99 with $20 activation credit... so it's really $109.99    Sometimes they're on sale @ best buy or futureshop... keep your eyes peeled~~    *There is a 911 service charge of 0.75    Plus free calling on your birthday~    There are more rates, just head on over to their website  ~~~    *Rogers and Fido are technically the same company... since owned by the same people    However these companies uses GSM, meaning they have sim cards and you can buy unlocked phones from overseas or basically anywhere and can use a large variety of phones... while telus are just designated phones that they have provided.    Fido has the simple $20 cents per min... This is more of a mom's plan... just plain basic No fees... flat 20 cents a min...    plus you get fido rewards... sorta like airmiles points but points towards how much you use which you can redeem for phones.    Fido has unlimited incoming texting so not like telus they won't chage...    Their texting rates are 15 cents a message just like the usual   but their texting packs are     10 texts for 30 cents a day  100 texts for 50 cents a day    Really basic... Basically a mom can reach you type of communication device.    Rogers offer more of a variety... since they have like  -Unlimited Talk/Text to 5 people for $29/month  Other than that they're pretty much same as telus's   http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wirele...    Except 911 fee is 50cents so it's a bit cheaper...    And their basic plan is like $0.25/min for 5 mins each day... so on your 6th minute it costs only $0.15/min so in a way it's better than Telus...    But telus has better prepaid handsets to offer...    Roger's prepaid and fido's are pretty crappy... but if you can buy a phone from a pawnshop or a cellular phone store and get a nice phone there, by all means you can use rogers/fido prepaid on it.      ~~~    If your parents allow you to... at this age starting High school you need a phone.. things get really busy... If they really trust you then you should open a montly plan... Go with either...    1]Fido (Roger's Discount Brand, owned and managed by Rogers)  2]Koodo (Telus' Discount Brand, owned and managed by Telus)    Their plans are very similar... Just a preference of phones and type of technology. Fido's technology is more up to date and you can use a wide variety of phones. Plus fido are 2 year contracts only, very short compared to the usual 3 years.    The koodo tab is a total scam for people that have cheap plans. But the good thing in a way is you're not locked into a contract... but if you want to leave you just pay how much money you owe them...    Tab is like they lend you money to buy a phone and you pay back with 10% of your bill's payment.|`|zzZz5BIqaa	get a razor good phone had one for four years worked well get unlimited texting|`|PmWTRZ1haa	WTF is Rogers or Bell  Just use AT&T or Verizon  Just get a Go-PHone with AT&t its pay as u go.|`|pwXdamk1aa	Pay As You Go charges you for EVERYTHING...every single text...so you run out of your money fast.  So either Bell or Rogers is good for Pay as You Go, so you should base your descision on what phones you like and which carrier provides them.  Depending on what you consider cheap, Rogers has a student plan (only for University and Highschool Students...) that's a great deal.  Its $25 a month and you get MY10 for the price of MY5.  So you get unlimited talk and text to 10 of your favourite people.  Go to: http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wirele...|`|QPUJyQTPaa	Cell phone services often vary from region to region and sometimes even their plans depend upon certain regions. So it becomes important to know which carrier is providing service in your area and what are the rate plans for your area? But what once took hours to choose the right plan visiting retail stores can now be done with or is just a few clicks away. Select the best cell phone plan of your choice in the convenience of your office or home.

tYmEgxL4aa	Well, technically, you shouldn't be able to purchase the first generation officially (From Apple). But if you get one from like ebay or something, you will most likely get the old plan, because the NEW plan for the 3g iphone is just that: 3G, which is not supported on the original iphone. :)    But i just reccomend paying extra for the 3G contract. While it is more expensive ($70 a month minimum, which is unlimited data and 450 anytime minutes), the service is faster, and the actual phone is cheaper.    EDIT: To the other answerer, dont answer if you're not sure...|`|DClXAc3zaa	yu would probably have to get the 3g plan . but im not sure .

EfejPjIMaa	Individual accounts is basically your own personal space.  You wouldn't want everyone in your family to use your e-mail address.  Your own personal account is basically the same thing.      Also, when playing a game online, you want your friends to know it is you.  If you were to have a brother or sister play your account, all your friends would think it is you, they wouldn't know it is someone else.    Also, when it comes to trophies, you don't want someone else in your family (or a friend) to get all the trophies for you.  That is an accomplishment you would like to brag about that you did on your own.      Just like everything in life, you can say it is yours, and no one else's.  Also, if you ever want to change your ID, you will need to register a new account, because once you associate an e-mail address with a PSN ID, it can't be changed.|`|N6FO8bMTaa	adidas' answer pretty much summed it all up.    Trophies, and online.    Example for online; In Call of Duty, you level up and get new guns, prestige and other neat stuff. You get stats depending on how you play. (How many kills you get per death on average, your online playing time, wins and losses, score.)    I would really hate for my sister to play on my account and ruin all my stats.

(tie) Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. (10/10)  1. (tie) Grand Theft Auto 4 (10/10)  3. LittleBigPlanet (9.7/10 and 9.5/10)  4. Resistance 2 (9.5/10) * (Note that I do not agree that this game should be in this list)  5. (Lots of ties) (9.4/10)  Killzone 2  Prince of Persia  Fallout 3  Bioshock  Bionic Commando Re-armed  Rock Band (Though go with Rock Band 2, obviously. Better instruments, songs, and if you have a friend with Rock Band 1 on the PS3, you can put all the songs on your disc. If not, rent it or something)  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (Call of Duty 5: Modern Warfare 2 is coming out this winter, and if you don't like Modern, there's Call of Duty: World at War. Both crazy online fun.)  Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction       Again though, it really depends on which genre you're looking for. You could go all shooters with this list if you wanted. Therefore, I strongly urge you to check out my link, and check out the other games in the 9s and even in the 8s.    Also, you should check which games are coming out soon, because there will be a lot of good ones.    So, my favourites are *Call of Duty 4, *Call of Duty: World at War, Metal Gear Solid 4, Skate 2, GTA IV, Rock Band 2,  Midnight Club: LA and LittleBigPlanet.  *note: You might not like these without online, for single-player campaign is short.

d942b465d5e28d6f595812ffa5d06b9baa	If you're on a mac, Sentui is great. I used it many many times.  http://www.fadingred.com/senuti/download...  It used to be free, but now its a 30 day trial kinda thing. But I'm sure there are serials around on the internet.    If you're on a pc, its even easier! No app needed, theres a very easy way to browse the music files on the iPod. You must have "show hidden folders enabled." To do this, open any file window (like my computer), in the top menu click Tools>Folder Options. Scroll down, and there will be a buble next to "Hide Hidden Folders," and "Show Hidden folders." Fill in the bubble next to "Show hidden folders," and thats it! Also make sure that in iTunes, if you select the iPod from the menu on the left, under the "General" tab, have the check box next to "Enable disk Use" checked. Now you can go under My Computer and your iPod will appear as an external hard drive. You can double click through the opaque folders to find your Music, which is under folders named F00 to F51 as I remember.    ~ilz  (You can also use the windows method on the mac if you wanted to, but to view hidden folders on a mac, you need to command it through terminal)|`|vwf4GsIPaa	uTorrent is a good program that I use

When you activate them ( the tracfone) the Sim card is registered with that phone and will only work with that phone.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	No. Trac Phone sim cards are in-cased inside the phone. If it is removed it will ruin the sim card. If you want a better phone I suggest getting a contract with a major cell phone company like Verizon and At&T. We use to have a pay as you go phone and had the brand you have right now. We paid out a lot more money a month on prepaid cards. We spend 56 dollars a month for 2 cell phones and our minutes roll over every month. We use to spend 80 bucks or more on one phone. We also just downgraded to the lowest plan possible, and we still have oodles of minutes to use. I have to say ditching the Trac Phone all together is a awesome route to take.|`|S5BkvnbMaa	No. And I tried switching my moms Tracfone sim card into her new tracfone and that didnt even work. I had to call tracfone.|`|7SqLDQ8Naa	Sorry but no you cant, a tracfone sims care is only compataible with tracfone and net ten phones.

uctxzjIIaa	No, it really doesn't. Season 2 has something based on distance, but not what you are probably looking for.    The first Super Swing only had one mode other than basic Stroke Play and Match Play. It was called Balloon Pop. In it, there were a bunch of balloons in the air, and everyone golfed simultaneously to score points by smacking the balloons (with balloons that were close enough to each other potentially being able to pop each other as they explode for more points).      SSG: Season 2 added two more minigames.    The first was called something like Golf Darts. You get three balls to hit from a tee about 80 Yds away and elevated well above the hole. It's basically a near-pin contest, since the pin is surrounded by 4 rings, and you get more points the smaller ring you hit it into (and most for putting it into the hole). However, one "pie slice" of all the rings is black, and you get no points for a ball that stops in there.    The second new game also gives you three balls, and the point is to hit it as far as possible on all three. However, the hole has a bunch of portals that launch the ball farther when you hit them through.

But you can also use an iPod transfer program, like Movavi iCopy - An indispensable addition to your iPod media library http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Movavi-iC...  to transfer all songs/videos on your mom's iPod to your iTunes. In this case, all songs are on the iTunes library, and you can easily make a nice playlist for your mom.    Best luck!

3K1QW7Oeaa	You can buy BETTER headphones! [You can basically get whatever, but there are two sides of the story]    Bose has an awful quality and disappoints me EVERY TIME.    Trust me, I've tried it all!    I tried their $99 desktop speakers! They sounded like my brothers laptop speakers! Replaced them with $60 Altec Lansing spakers! BEST PURCHASE!    I tried the $149 Bose Tri-Port headphones. My $20 Sony headphones almost matched the same quality! The only difference is that the Bose headphones added WAY TOO MUCH bass, it got annoying (and I LOVE bass.)    To the $600 5.1 speakers (disappointment!) You got an annoying hiss from the small speakers and they were noticeable as you turned the volume. There was also too much bass in the subwoofer and there seemed to be no way to fix that, regardless of how much you turned the back knobs.    Decided to try the $1000 system which was the BIGGEST disappointment of them all! They sounded awesome. They sounded awesome, until I heard my grandmother's Infinity system! That $1000 system was gone!    In the end, got an Infinity system and love it! They sounded just like the $1000 system and more for half the price!!    Bottom line: Bose is crap! All your paying for is the brand! Go for Sony or Senheiser!!      As You Wish - Earbuds ruin your ears as the sound is going DIRECTLY into the earbud.|`|La49JNrAaa	Skull candy are great for me. they are comfortable and the sound quality is great too|`|qBDL8iFxaa	bose are my favorite|`|l1vzoQ1uaa	skullcandy ! they rockkk [x|`|AzdAvDW1aa	get the kind that go really high|`|EnkWULaqaa	Ultimate ears super.fi 5 pros for IEMs, and audio technica ad700s for headphones. both under 200 at amazon.  they stay in your ears great, have amazing sound quality, and are just 'fun' to listen to.   the person who said bose is crap is pretty much right, too. the make decent products that cost 3 times what they're worth.   skullcandies just suck. I used to think they were amazing too, until I started trying out different headphones. they boost the bass a lot, but it's boosted terribly. it's not 'tight' or pleasant at all, it overpowers the highs, (which sound tinny and full of suck as it is) and they are really muddy. that pretty much goes for ALL skullcandies, too. I have friends who have everything from the ink'd to the FMJs, and I can't even stand to listen to them. they're just terrible. everyone thinks they're so great because they have a lot of bass and block out noise, but so do almost all other IEMs, and they have real bass, instead of the muddy, crap-sounding static-y awful that skullcandy gives you.|`|xQsMPtFGaa	wireless headphone! my sister has them and theyre awesome! you can be rocking out in the bathroom to michael jackson taking a huge dump while your ipod is in the other room!|`|AA10328968	Get earbuds not headphones, they stay in your ears so much better.

But beware, with a scan converter, you will not get the same resolution as you had with the original display.     There is no cable that can convert VGA to S-Video. A scan converter takes in a whole frame of VGA and throws away about every other line of details to crreate a composite or svideo image. The Svideo will look better that composite but NOT anywhere near as good as VGA. Not even close. You might be a lot better off finding a small flat pannel VGA monitor.|`|Aqik51lCaa	Walmart will probably have it i'd check there website first tho

CKRfaRYvaa	That depends on your plan.  If you have a plan that charges long distance, then you will still be charged long distance on the nights/weekends.  However, if you are on a plan that does not charge long distance then you will not be charged on the nights/weekends.  In other words, if you are on a nationwide plan, then you will not be charged.  If you are on a local or regional plan then you will be.

AbRfd29Haa	Ok, a couple of things... with  a CIF sized sensor, your video isn't ever going to look fantastic. 30fps is good enough to look like motion video -- most film is 24fps (shuttered at 48fps so it doesn't flicker).     If your PC is dropping frames, that could account for the appearance of 2-3fps. As well, if you're taking a second to see anything, that's what's called latency, and it's certainly induced by the computer itself.     One thing to try... when you're bringing in CIF video and blowing it up to 640x480, you gain nothing, but you are making your PC work harder. A modern PC shouldn't have trouble with this (the webcam in my laptop delivers perfectly smooth video, in realtime), so if yours is, something needs to be configured differently. Try capture at 352x200 or 352x288 at 30fps and see if that helps. Try using a different webcam or video capture tool... could be your application itself is to blame. If it's USB (probably is), make sure it's not on a USB 1.1 port or hub if you have USB 2.0 available.     The fact that you have a such a cheap camera actually speaks to the fact that the latency you see can't be due to the camera. Delays imply storage, and there's no way that camera is buffering up much if any video... it wants to dump the video as soon as it's captured.|`|MTx1BJmlaa	How much did you buy the webcam?  Because usually a webcam thats under $30-20 will have not alot of fps compared to $50+ ones.  I recommened you buy at least a $40+ one.    Yes then there's your problem.

j5Apt8hWaa	They are both excellent.  The Nikon D90 also includes HD video, the 50D does not.    Link to some full articles on the two.    http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d90.htm    http://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/50d.htm    Since you obviously do not already have a 35 mm SLR system or a DSLR system (and thus would be choosing the camera that matched your current system), I would pick the D90 since it will start you off with a system which should eventually include the amazing low noise at high ISO the current Nikon D3 has.|`|7SXA5dhDaa	Most reviewers put the Canon 50D in a higher category than the Nikon D90.  One of the reviewers, Consumer Reports, does rate the 50D better than the D90.  Another reviewer, http://www.dpreview.com/, compares the 50D with the Nikon D300 (a higher quality Nikon than the D90).  And it compares the D90 with the Canon 450D, a lower level Canon.  That said, the 50D should be a better camera.  And that comes from a person who recently bought the Nikon D90 and loves it.|`|fvTL6vFpaa	I once asked a similar question.  Someone lead me to a website at www.dxomark.com.  They do what seems to be very unbiased technical analysis of various DSLR's image sensors including the D90 and 50D.  If you interested to just compare numbers this is a really good site for it.  From DXO's result I found the D90 has a better score which would lead me to believe that it possibly has better image quality over the 50D.  However, the 50D I think has a better build and contruction quality as it more oriented to the semi-pro/serious amateur market.|`|3TqPF1zMaa	Neither is better. They are both excellent. Stop trying to decide what camera to buy based upon other people's opinions and meaningless statistics. Go to the store, put both cameras in your hands and try them.

OcfL1QNcaa	Depends what you want from it. I'm guessing you're choosing not between X Box and PS3, but X-box 360 and PS3. There are three major things to consider:    Xbox 360 is the cheapest (without getting hard drives, etc), while the ps3 has a fixed price. If you get them fully equipped, (Depending on the store) it's pretty much the same deal.    The types of games you like are also something you should consider. If you like RPG'S and adventure games, PS3 is generally the better choice. I have found that FPS games tend to be better on XBox but that is open to interpretation.    The PS3 has a blueray player built in. If you don't have one of these, the PS3 can read them, AND it plays games, a pretty sweet deal. Blueray readers can run from $115 to $500, about the same as you'll pay for a new ps3. Not bad.     If you are getting one soon, go to Circut City, as their closing sales might help you out with the money, (10% off or more is nothing to scoff at.    As for the enhanced wii: it won't be worth it. As far as I've seen, the only added feature is a dvd playback, which isn't required for any of the wii games or features. (Xbox 360 and PS3 both have dvd playback)|`|Yt6TaiYlaa	I also have a wii but it isn't enough, there aren't enough games out there, so I'm going to buy a PS3 myself, because I've always been a playstation fan, and it has a built in blue-ray player, which is really cool. Most games come out for both systems too, so I won't miss TOO much on the Xbox, except Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts.|`|qaPyaFUcaa	Go with an XBOX 360.

You won't regret buying it.

441GSyaMaa	I'd prefer the 360 over PS3, I think the good thing about PS3's are that they have Blu-Ray. I mean even the game Metal Gear Solid which was an apparent exclusive... is coming to Xbox 360 (apparently)    I mean I don't have a PS3, personally, but the 360 is all I need to be honest.    I think I want a PS3 for Little Big World or Planet, whatever it's called... that looks highly fun    oh wait wait wait. I read on a forum that an analyst is saying that he predicts there to be a price drops for PS3's in about April time, so i'd wait a few months and see what happens (it's quite a dramatic one too)|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Great Configuration, Great Console,Fun game,good online game|`|RqP8j5DMaa	Good free online,  Good exclusives  Good games   Blu ray  Comes with wireless controller  Killzone 2 ;]|`|DPQVGWDDaa	major difference between ps3 and xbox360, is that on the ps3 it is free to play online    xbox 360 online costs money|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	FOR THE RECORD, JON COPIED MY ANSWER    Why you should get a PS3 and NOT a Xbox 360    The expected lifetimes of current home video game consoles:    Xbox 360--2005-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it  Wii-2006-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it  Playstation 3-2015 (Sony said they made it to last 10 years, so 2006+10 years=2016, round it down just to be safe), you'll get 7 years out of it.    The PS3 is the obvious choice here. In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future, it will have over-the-top graphical capabilities (google Heavy Rain). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:    With the PS3, you get:  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet, plus a mean DVD-upconverter  -Free online service, the Playstation Network, which is only a few steps behind Xbox Live these days  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi  -Web browser  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive  -HDMI 1.3, Xbox 360 only has HDMI 1.2 (major difference despite only a 0.1 difference)    With the Xbox 360, you get:  -DVD Player/upconverter  -Xbox live, which is $50/year, and not even worth it  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (thats a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)  -Ummcant really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories.  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")s  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 11th!    So heres a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:    PS3:  Console $400  Game $60  Controller $55  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do  Total: $517 ($2 USB mini cable)    Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)    Xbox 360:  Console $300  Game $60  Controller $60  Play and Charge kit x2 $60 (for 2 controllers)  Xbox Live $60  Wi-Fi $100  Total: $640    Thats not cheaper, so get a grip on it! Sony said that they made the PS3 to last a decade. The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.    On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. Its just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.    Also, many Xbox fanboys will say "Sure, LIVE is 50 bucks a year, but you get what you pay for." Isn't this like a Sony fanboy saying "Sure, PS3 is a 100 bucks more, but that is *pretty much* all you pay for, other than games?"    So in conclusion, the PS3 is betteryou get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer-legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).    Hope this helps!    Source(s):  --PS3 expert--      Joke:  Q: Why do they call it a "360"?    A: It really does a 360:    1) You get it  2) It breaks down  3) You ship it to Microsoft  4) Wait 3-4 weeks  5) Be happy, and start again from step 1.|`|pl2SocVKaa	well the ps3 is a high powered system with blu ray which makes ps3 worthwhile from the start but it does have great exclusives free online are well enough worth it and it can play demos of games you can download games make nice themes make levels in games are just a few you can do adn also get trophies for games and games play smooth and load and save fast and look simply amazing like killzone 2 or uncharted drakes fortune and its similar to 360 in a way so thats why its worth the money|`|ErtxmW4Xaa	you play games by moving the remote on racing games if u set it    good graphics     amazing online gameplay    good games :)    hope you get 1 and i see u online :)|`|fIeczCoDaa	the ps3 is way better the xbox 360 for a few reasons. u have to pay to go online for the 360 whereas to go online on the ps3, its free. the games are about the same so dont worry about that. the 360 has had some major issues. i havent heard about anything bad with the ps3. if i were u, get the ps3 haha|`|AA11128305	Some of the exclusives are reason enough on their own, Valkyria Chronicles is my current favourite, Disgaea 3 is the one before that. Some people seem to love Metal Gear Solid 4, but I've not tried that one myself.    Another point: The PS3 can play PS3 games from any region. I have a UK PS3 and usually play UK games, but I ordered Disgaea 3 from America since it hasn't come out over here yet and won't for months.    The PS3 online is free, unlike the 360 online which costs about 40 a year. The online content that you have to pay for costs actual money too, so you don't have to buy points cards like the Wii and 360 and pay too much to only use a few of the points.    Like the 360, many games have demos that you can download with the PS3. It's very useful if you want to try a game out before you buy it.    It has a Blu-Ray player built in, so both the game discs can hold more data if they need to and it can play Blu-Ray movies, as well as DVDs.    It's possible with a little work to connect the PS3 to the PC and use it to play all your movies/music/photos/etc from your PC on the TV via the PS3.    It's a personal preference, but the controller is probably the nicest of the three most recent consoles.      I have all three consoles and the PS3 is the one I like the most.|`|d381leKpaa	look at these FACTS man!     For One, the PS3 will last the longest for the next gen consoles that are out now:    Xbox 360 was made in 2005, they've already made a different version of it (Elite) so soon they'll have the next 360, more likely the 720, probably in 2010-2012 that's not very long 1-3 years of play  Wii- was poorly designed in 2006. They'll have to make the Wii 2 sometime soon, probably 2010-2012 as well.  Playstation 3- was made in the same year as the Wii, 2006. Sony designed it though to last for 10 years! Meaning it will still be around and popular in 2016.    The PS3 amazing. It has better reliability, can be turned into a PC and download Windows XP or Vista, or for free download Linux. For everything that it has, it is much cheaper then the Xbox 360, consider the following.  With the PS3, you get:  -A Blue-Ray player, and one of the best ones out so far. It is also considered new technology. If you don't have Blue-Ray players to start out with when buying the PS3, it also has a DVD upconverter, meaning that you can play normal DVD's with better quality picture.  -The PS3 also features PSN( the (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork). It's free to use, and download demo's such as Warhawk, and Home. Unlike Xbox Live, it doesn't cost $80 for the first year bundle, and $50 for each following year.  -The PS3 has exlusives like no other console, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)  -For the money, you get 80GB of space, and only 60GB on the Xbox 360, USB mini drives can also be used from the 2.0 USB ports in the front of the PS3. It also has an easily removable HDD.  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi  -Web browser, just like a PC's    On the Xbox 360's you get a 1 in 3 failure rate. Even though Microsoft knows of this problem, they don't even think about the red rings of death while shipping it out to unsuspecting customers    So heres a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:    PS3:  Console(there will be a $100 decrease in April 2009) $300  Game $60  Controller $55  Total: $415    Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)    Xbox 360:  Console $300  Game $60  Controller $60  Xbox Live $80  Wi-Fi $100  Total: $660    As you can see, the PS3 is cheaper by far and plus, The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So that means much better graphics in the future when they can get a grip on the PS3's power.    On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. Its just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate.

Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.    So pretty much, the PS3 wins hands down. It's the best system people have seen yet! The PS3 will also progress in the future, like it's downgraded because it was so good that other people couldn't afford it. So anyways hope I helped!|`|fWclxi9Baa	yes the ps3 is worth it and now is the best time to get one with games like     uncharted 2 coming soon and also   resident evil 5  mag   cod modern warfare 2   street fighter iv and others to name its the best time to get one and its alot of fun also the blu ray player is awesome i love the movies crystal clear picture|`|mb3ooc3uaa	It could be depending on what games you like. Regarding to the person who listed the prices, He is saying the PS3 is $300, which its not. Sony has denied there will be a price cut. If there is a price cut, rumors say it will happen in April. Xbox Live is $80? It costs nothing to sign up for it and $50 for the year. You only need to wireless adapter if you plan on using wireless. You can buy a console for $199, won't have a 20gig hard drive. All 360 consoles come with 1-2 free games. The official 360 controller is $5 less then the PS3 official controller.  Don't listen to everything people say. Get a PS3 if it has games you want to play. I got a 360 cause it has more online games to play and more people play online with 360 then PS3. After seeing Killzone2 clips, it has made me think about buying s PS3. This year I think is pretty bleak for the 360 and looking good for PS3. Only 360 game I'm looking forward to this year is CoD6 which is for PS3 as well.|`|VcNHahtgaa	PROS:  PS3 -  1. Free Online, keeps getting better. Soon to match Xbox Live.  2.

It was cheaper than BLU RAY players I was looking at and had other uses.    Games and BLU RAY look great at 1080i displayed on my wall (2.5 wide screen) through projector and I pass it through my amp by HDMI to get great sound!    Although I have not bothered to try it yet, I understand PS3 can interact with PSP and media servers.    Also, youcan surf the net with a PS - though some would argue the function is limited and cumbersome without a keyboard / mouse setup.    Edit - note not all BLU RAY or games disks output at highest definition!|`|8DCGUG2Aaa	okay i think you should get it . i have tons of reasons . here    1) reliable ( lasts 10 years)  2) free online  3) blu ray  4) ps home  5) controller works like wii controller  6) psn store has some really cool games exclusively.  7) online play doesnt lag and times out like xbox 360 online.  8) hot games( killzone 2, uncharted 2 , gt5 , and maaany more)  9) blu ray disk has more capacity than regular dvds so better games will come on ps3.  10) internet browser    you know it's a little bit expensive but its worth it. trust me.    And if you are a type of guy who likes hanging with friends online or just play online, or things like that , ps3 is the best place becuase of PS home , the ultimate online community . This is what that separates ps3 from x360 .    if u are a hardcore online gamer , ps3 is your way to go . with cool online titles like Socom confrontation , dc universe online, resistance 2, killzone 2, mgs4, or mag, Ps3 dominates the online play .    So go out there , buy it , friend add me at " badshah44 , and will see u online then.    and mgs4 will never come out on x360.|`|v5eDd9s2aa	lol at these guys. take it from me dude, because I have both. I might actually sell my ps3 because I dont use it as much as the good ol 360 that I've had for years. 360 has better games, better graphics, BETTER CONTROLLER omg the ps3 controller is tiny the joysticks to close and too sensitive and is made for little kids..its tiny..horrible for first person shooters. Xbox 360 has way better games and a much larger selection and better exclusives like gears of war, halo, left 4 dead, etc, etc.. TRUST ME. If you want a true gaming machine get a 360..if you want a blu ray player, get a ps3..thats all i use my ps3 for, a blu ray player, so i guess it has some use lol.

EfejPjIMaa	Just because your wireless connection is getting 100% percent when you look at it doesn't mean it is getting 100% all the time.  Your router may be resetting (or your modem) which is causing the disconnection, and then when you look at the signal strength, it says 100%.  You don't know what the signal strength is when it is disconnecting.      Make sure your router isn't resetting, or that the router isn't kicking your wireless devices (PS3) offline for a second (which is long enough for the error message you are getting on the PS3).      If you're not sure if the router is resetting, then update the PS3 by hooking it straight up to the modem, then once the update is finished, you can mess with the router and PS3.|`|mZdQ9N2taa	This same problem pissed me off when i got my ps3 but heres the solution its probably your wireless connection isnt strong enough in other words keeps dropping connection. so what i did was connect an ethernet cable to my router and me ps3 and it worked fine then i did it wirelesly again and it worked perfectly.|`|VaGgWSTfaa	That has happened to me to and I just kept trying and it will go after a couple of tries and it will happen when you try to update software for games too. just keep at it and it will work.|`|RoMnjrataa	Try turning your ps3 off and then on again...

1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	Sounds like you have your DVD hooked up via component video input (red green blue wires) and either one wire is bad, the input or output of the component video is bad, or you don't have your DVD player setup for component video output. All these could lead to the problem you describe.    Seeing as how it was working, I would bet a cable fell out. Check the cables to see if they are all still securely attached. If they are then try replacing the cable(you can try using a composite AV cable which is yellow red white. just make sure the colors that go out from one color enter into the same color).    Also, check your DVD player settings to see if you have to select component video output. I have personally had to do this for my model DVD player(samsung)|`|Gap7JgxOaa	BCUZ ITS MESSED UP

bcabcc73547bcd4289b2a6f33bf89858aa	There are quite a few multi effects pedals from people like Zoom and Boss that are very good value when you compare it to the price of individual pedals/effects.    I would look to those brands for a box that has wah, distortion, delay, chorus, and a built in rocker pedal to control volume and wah (and maybe pitch), for 2 or 3X the cost of one single pedal.    Or for even cheaper you could look at the Line 6 Pod Farm software to run on your computer.

There's discount IF you renew your contract for 2 years- otherwise there usually is NOT.  You mighy find one on certain old phones.    Your 2 year discount is pretty good- you're but otherwise you're kinda stuck,  It also means if you take the small discount on the phone and renew for 2 years, you will have to wait for another 2 years to recieve that really good discount.    We just had to go through this with one of our phone lines where the phone went through the washing machine so we were forced to purchase another phone fast.|`|r7qsCMqMaa	I assume you mean Verizon.

QE71sNC3aa	A decent full-sized electronic set would run you closer to $300.00. Sam's Club sells a brand called Sound X that sounds better than some much more expensive drums I've heard. Has a nice pro-style pedal / trigger for the kick drum...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOBUsWnHp...    It really dosn't pay to buy garbage when buying any type of musical instrument, maybe even more so for a beginner. If it doesn't play well or sound really good when you get something right... there's no point putting effort into playing it. That's the whole point of a musical instrument. Anybody would lose interest.    There is a very decent option in your price-range if you can't do a full-sized set (but that would be WAY more fun).    For under $150.00... there is the Awowo Live Drums Plus. Really, it's the only decent set out there at that price. You can actually do quite a bit with one of these and have a lot of fun. The small size isn't quite as fun to play as a full-sized set... The pads don't have perfect "bounce" for super fast playing...  The pedals aren't the best and can sound double beats or fail do sound if you don't hit them quite right... The sound of the set is very good for the price though. It has a jack for headphones and an input jack for a personal audio player. Jamming along with some favorite songs is very fun, a good way to learn and like I said, the sound is pretty good on these.    There are models with and without a built-in digital recorder for a small price difference.    http://www.neweggmall.com/Product/200308...    http://www.neweggmall.com/Product/200308...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE0esXTw4...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNapC2l5q...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuIi4HIBq...|`|zgmMoDmIaa	Used on craigslist|`|8lTjwBEzaa	There is this brand called first act it's for kids and little brother got a first act guitar he doesan't play it much but we have it in our studio to in case he wants to start again.

Make shure you are not in a party with someone you want to play with.many people have said this is one reason why it wont let you connect. another reason is that you updated you xbox and you modem/router is use to the old settings, since somthing has changed while it updated. Try turning off your modem/router and turning it back on. if that does not work, you may have to go to your router settings and turn off any security.

tgT5MAO5aa	I play both but when i got my xbox i started play way more of it. Some of the exclusive games on an xbox are in my opinion worth getting the system for, Halo2 was the only reason i bough an origion xbox and it turned out to be a good choice. even though a computer might have a similar or the same game it is often a different experience when playing on a controller over a mouse(its preference really on what you like better) but a console game is always going to control in a more simple manor. The main reason to get an xbox is for Live, sure it cost a little every month but it is definitely worth it. The ease of connecting and communicating with people and friends is such a luxury after playing a lot of PC.|`|441GSyaMaa	It's just more fun... can play with a family, friends whoever else...     the 360 is so versatile (well any modern console is) and does really blow the PC out of the water...

Achievements!! lol|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	How much did your rig cost??? ^_^  When did you upgrade it last?? ^_^  How much is it going to cost you to upgrade enough to play ( enter name of upcoming game with ridiculous requirements ) ?    My 360 is good for a couple more years at least. The only real advantage I'd give PCs over Consoles is the freedom to Mod your games, which a clever hacker can still do with consoles too.|`|AA11897439	well with a concle you dont have to look at the specs to see if it runs the game
Daern917aa	You can't really play Guitar Hero or group games on a computer right? So if you have friends that come over often that want to play games like that. I guess it'd be cool to have a PS3 with some group activity games like Rock Band.    In addition, I think it looks pretty nice and can make your home feel sexy with an HDTV. :)|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	Well if you have a good PC than you don't need a ps3 the only thing I can find is blu-ray player.|`|raEUval8aa	In all honesty, not really. IF you have an incredible gaming PC, there's really no need for a console, unless you're a huge fan of a certain series, like Metal Gear Solid.|`|ErtxmW4Xaa	wen ur bored u go on it and better graphics then pc|`|d381leKpaa	here, take a look at these cold hard FACTS about the PS3  For One, the PS3 will last the longest for the next gen consoles that are out now:    Xbox 360 was made in 2005, they've already made a different version of it (Elite) so soon they'll have the next 360, more likely the 720, probably in 2010-2012 that's not very long 1-3 years of play  Wii- was poorly designed in 2006. They'll have to make the Wii 2 sometime soon, probably 2010-2012 as well.  Playstation 3- was made in the same year as the Wii, 2006. Sony designed it though to last for 10 years! Meaning it will still be around and popular in 2016.    The PS3 amazing. It has better reliability, can be turned into a PC and download Windows XP or Vista, or for free download Linux. For everything that it has, it is much cheaper then the Xbox 360, consider the following.  With the PS3, you get:  -A Blue-Ray player, and one of the best ones out so far. It is also considered new technology. If you don't have Blue-Ray players to start out with when buying the PS3, it also has a DVD upconverter, meaning that you can play normal DVD's with better quality picture.  -The PS3 also features PSN( the (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork). It's free to use, and download demo's such as Warhawk, and Home. Unlike Xbox Live, it doesn't cost $80 for the first year bundle, and $50 for each following year.  -The PS3 has exlusives like no other console, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)  -For the money, you get 80GB of space, and only 60GB on the Xbox 360, USB mini drives can also be used from the 2.0 USB ports in the front of the PS3. It also has an easily removable HDD.  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi  -Web browser, just like a PC's    On the Xbox 360's you get a 1 in 3 failure rate. Even though Microsoft knows of this problem, they don't even think about the red rings of death while shipping it out to unsuspecting customers    So heres a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:    PS3:  Console(there will be a $100 decrease in April 2009) $300  Game $60  Controller $55  Total: $415    Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)    Xbox 360:  Console $300  Game $60  Controller $60  Xbox Live $80  Wi-Fi $100  Total: $660    As you can see, the PS3 is cheaper by far and plus, The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So that means much better graphics in the future when they can get a grip on the PS3's power.    On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. Its just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.    So pretty much, the PS3 wins hands down. It's the best system people have seen yet! The PS3 will also progress in the future, like it's downgraded because it was so good that other people couldn't afford it. So anyways hope I helped!|`|1HtTxOOQaa	I personally feel that consoles are the ultimate gaming rigs out there. You don't have to worry about upgrading them every 6-10 months, there are regular games released every week so, there is hardly any drought in games. Also, PC is seeing less games per year cause the developers prefer consoles where they can cater to a larger crowd compared to a Pc which is seeing less and less gamers. Also, developers are really choosey of making PC games cause most of the games end up in torrent sites where they are downloaded by millions for FREE. This can cause serious losses to the developers and so as time goes we will see less and less games on PC compared to PS3.  PS3 has a better online community where playing with friends is easy.   Blu-Ray is another major factor. All Ps3's have one and it's the future.    Also, please don't compare the PS3's graphic card and RAM with a high end PC. PS3 uses a different way of making games. You might have heard of the 'CELL PROCESSOR' the PS3 has. The PS3 has a Nvidia 7800 card which is pre historic. The same card on the PC wouldn't even be able to run CRYSIS on it's lowest settings. But, when put in a PS3, along with the 8 core powered Cell processor, it can produce games like Killzone 2 which have graphics equivalent to that of Crysis. It's unfair to compare the graphic card.   Sony has spent billions of dollars and have joined with their rivals Toshiba and IBM to create the Processor and trust me, the true power hasn't yet been unleashed.    There are many other factors but, I think that consoles are the future of gaming. the main advantage is that hardware remains constant and so by the middle and end of a consoles life, developers are so well acquainted with the architecture, that they produces the best looking games. See PS2 for example. Compare the first gen games and the games released during the last few years of it's life (God Of War 2). There was a massive difference. So, I think that Ps3 can even be pushed further to handle great looking games (even better than KZ2).    In the end, you only have to make a choice. I think PC should always be meant for the stuff it's meant to do. Consoles are solely developed for gaming in mind whereas PC for other stuff as well. PC games might look good, but the times are changing as we can see games like KZ2 can look great. PC is loosing exclusives really fast. Crysis was good, but one game can't change it's fate. All Pc owners don't have blu-Ray drives so developers can't make big games whereas they have the liberty to do that on a PS3.   For me, consoles are the future and the PS3 is a start|`|6eiCySQfaa	Well if you already own all that pc crap there is no advantage at all.... but if you want to play games and you don't have the money for a top notch gaming pc then a ps3 is a good fun "CHEAP" choice

WOiH4CGvaa	Yes it's true, the reason being that the individual sensors are further apart.    I'm sure someone will give you a more detailed answer, but not a different one!    I'm trying to watch the Lakers/Celtics game or I would!|`|tWoN22rRaa	It's not the size of the sensor itself that matters. But rather the size of the individual pixels (or "photosites"). Though if a small sensor and a big one have exactly the same number of MP,  the bigger sensor will have bigger pixels.    Why are bigger pixels important? Well because they have more surface area for collecting light. And the more light that is collected, the stronger their signal to noise ratio is.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	As the others have said it has got to do with the size of the pixels. Smaller pixels packed close together generate more heat. The more heat that is created the more noise becomes visible. This is really apparent when you compare a DSLR with a point and shoot camera. Even a crop sensor DSLR has a sensor that is 15 times larger than that of a point and shoot. Where as a full frame sensor is only about twice as big as an APS-C sized sensor or 30 times larger than a 4/3 sensor of a point and shoot camera.

zSRAeohcaa	The description "$350" and "Gaming PC" do not really go together.    Of course it all depends on what type of games you want to play and how old they are.      If you are into games from the Source Engine like Half Life 2 series games, Counter-Strike Source, Gary's Mod and Portal, you can probably go for a PC build anywhere from $500 to $1000    If you are talking Crysis, Far Cry 2, or any game DirectX10 status I would think you would shell out like $1000 minimum.    Of course, this all depends on what you want your quality of the games you play to be, and what games you will be playing.    If you are able to build a computer from the parts you will be able to save yourself a lot of money, and even scrap some parts from your old computer to help save on the cost of a new one.  For example, a nice way to save money is to salvage your DVD/CD Drive, Hard Drive, RAM, and ANYTHING else that you can take from your old computer to put onto your new one.  Sites like Tigerdirect.com and newegg.com sell computer parts for good prices and even group together some nifty bundles to save money.

bCkw8E8faa	kodak... i probably dropped it 20 times and it still works|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	look at models form canon or nikon, note though to check the spec's. if it says (digital zoom), do'nt get it. get one with optical zoom. do'nt get too bogged down with magapixels, 6 to 8 used to be fine until the industry started the "megapixel race". look maybe at Canon Powershots, $200-300 range. they are really good.|`|7163e7b1b4ec3a9d80c4e7787f033a47aa	you should get a super zoom for her, it would fit the price range and she could have a lot of creative liscense. panasonic's super zoom cameras are always good.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Get her a digital camera.

Xxviy63Paa	Well it sounds like Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 would be just the thing.    Tom Clancy End War is excellent for its 3d visuals but it's mostly base capture, and then upgrade the bases, rather than creating the actual base from scratch and adding buildings.     If you like the old command and conquer/warcraft style of rts, you might want to make your own. Download the Stratagus engine and you can create you own rts game, or use the Battle of Survival set that already exists for it.    For something a bit different, Defcon is a nuclear war game. You don't get to build anything, but it's a great rts game and takes about as long as a real nuclear war. It's cheap too at $17.50.|`|jqrrMSrRaa	Rome Total War was one of the best Strategy games i ever played, but its a bit dated now.  You can always wait for Starcraft 2|`|ykXzzx65aa	End War

The reason you may not be getting sound may be that the modulator is not getting audio from your source.  The modulator needs to be fed video and audio from your source (DVD player or whatever).    You may need to call a company to come in and help you.  Hospitals use this type of system for the TV's in each room so it can be done.    My e-mail is in my profile if you need more help.|`|BsV2TQAvaa	Are you using the correct grade of cable?    How many times are you splitting the cable signal from the modulator to a given TV?     Have you made a defective cable end where the ground is either not connected or shorting to the signal lead?  Either will be devastating to signal strength.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I could live without any kind of phone, but to me a computer is a part of my life.  I've had two major heart attacks, though, and my husband has had a stroke, so for safety sake, we both have cell phones that we carry, turned off, when we go out ... and know where they are when we are home ... simply to call 911 when necessary.  If we wanted, though, we could do our 'phone' through our computers, and if we could call 911 using 'text' on the computers, we'd switch to just computers.  We are both 'phoneophobes' (both terrified of the phone ringing and having to make calls) which is rather weird, since being a phoneophobe is one of the 'least found' phobias!|`|QXY34a7Laa	phone... i would pay for a device that made it impossible for people to find me.    my computer is my special friends though.    I love pancakes too.|`|lbmFP6ayaa	WITHOUT A COMPUTER..|`|OcpxTcJ9aa	I never use the phone, sooo....

I can text message via Gmail, I can send MMS messages via email, I can browse the web (duh), I can make phone calls with Skype.    There's nothing my phone can't do (aside from fit into my pocket and call 911) that my computer can't.    Also, I'm attending college for Game Development, which is kind of a challenge to do without a computer.|`|nUy1Z7eqaa	I would rather live mt life without the computer!

Vq3COSvTaa	dunno|`|JB9ZoBQeaa	what kind of videos? if their regular videos just go to free http://media-convert.com/, plug your phone to your computer or if you have a slot for memory cards then find the proper memory card converter. Convert the videos to whatever media type the rant accepts, you can find this out by going into the phone taking a video then going to properties and seeing. Then drag the converted video from your computer after you have saved it from the site and put it on your phone inside dcim.
