G2auAv1Saa	Women having babies at 15 and even much younger used to be very common place. (The Virgin Mary was thought to be around 13 or so) So the female body at that age, is equipped to have a baby. <br>  <br>  With the way a females mind and maturity develops these days I do not think they are ready for a child or start their own lives at all.|`|rjVALevtaa	Yes, of course. The only reason teen mothers are known for having smaller babies is because of poor nutrition.<br>  <br>  As soon as a girl begins her menstrual cycle, her body is ready to have children. Now, emotionally and psychologically that is another story.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	15 year old have normal healthy babies all the time.

kc26mQCBaa	He could very well have a sensitivity to your milk. My brother had this problem. The reaction was evident on his skin and my mother ended up having to feed him soy based baby milk. Ask the pediatrician if it looks like this is the problem & he'll recommend something.
PFfABk30aa	I just read an article on this not even a week ago. It was in Baby Talk magazine i believe. The pediatrician that was writing the article said that this is what you do:<br>  start feeding as normal<br>  if she starts to bit-DO NOT REACT W/ VOICE OR FACES<br>  take her off the breast and set her beside you<br>  then after a second or if she starts crying re attach her<br>  Continue to do this. She says that they usually pick up after just a couple times that if they bite, they won't get the milk. I think some babies/tots are a little more head strong like my son so it may end up taking a while but eventually she should catch on. I hope this helps. Just remember that other than taking her off your breast, DON'T REACT ANY OTHER WAY such as saying 'ouch' and what not. That gives her what she wants. She does it and smiles because she's getting a reaction out of you which is what she wants. if she don't get what she wants and looses her milk she'll learn to stop. I think it makes pretty good since.|`|AA12003963	DO not yell ouch, she thinks its funny. What you do is when she bites just remove her quietly, leave her off for 20 seconds or so, even though she will cry, then quietly put her back on. After a few removals she'll get the hint. Good luck.|`|kc26mQCBaa	Instead of saying ouch, take her off the breast. She will catch on & stop the biting.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I have no idea how you would stop that, maybe you could ask your doc and see if they know. I never had that problem sorry|`|207dFmdHaa	I went thru the same thing, I was breastfeeding triplets, and all 3 did the same thing, I stopped breastfeeding, this was at about 4-5 months|`|crw44vnRaa	You can see she's testing you, this is the beginning of her finding out her boundaries. She needs to learn that when she hurts you the out come isn't nice for her either, when she bites you tell her NO! and pull her off, let that be the end of feeding time for 5 minutes then start over. She will soon get the point that you mean what you say and that biting isn't nice for her.|`|VpcT7dUgaa	Good for you for nursing! Keep it up - there are so many benefits for your baby and for you (the longer you nurse the more it lowers your risk of breast cancer).<br>  <br>  Every baby is different, so you will probably have to try a few techniques to figure out which one is effective. And remember, if she goes through this phase again a few months down the road, the approach that works now may not work then. As I recall, my 2.5 year-old daughter went through 3 separate (and thankfully, short) biting episodes. Of course, it was much more painful once she had teeth and the older she got the more I felt she could understand and I made my reactions stronger.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope you find some answers in the links below.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	LOL...I am going through the exact same thing as you with my 6 month old. He has no teeth yet but has been gum biting for months now. He thinks it's funny too and they know exactly what they are doing as they laugh at us when they do it :) My son bites me at every session and I have been getting used to it now. What I will do is just remove him from the breast all together and tell him "No more booby for you" and stop the session. Normally he's been eating for a while so I know he's not starving. I will then put him back on later. It's just a learning game with these little bitters isn't it. My first son only bit me twice and that was when he had some teeth and was self weaning himsef at 9 months old. I hope it does get better for us and when they do get teeth I hope they will stop!!!|`|AaoclPYCaa	She is looking for your reaction.  When she bites take her off and let her cry.  You have to let her know that biting is not acceptable behavior.    At 7 months she should be getting ready for sippy cups.  You may want to pump and put the breast milk in a sippy cup or a bottle.

It happens sometimes and blood clots would give you all of those symptoms that you have described. If you are feeling better now then I wouldn't worry anymore. If you still feel sick then you should definitely see a doctor. Alot of times after the clot passes, your symptoms should go away within a day or 2.
lWVgQYs8aa	I have a 5 month old who I also breastfed. I weaned her a few weeks ago. I didn't have any problem loosing weight since day one. However, I did notice that I lost more after I stopped breastfeeding. I'm not insinuating that you should stop breastfeeding, especially if everything is going well. But, its like my body stayed in pregnant mode while I was still nursing. After she was weaned completely I lost a lot more weight and my appetite went completely down. <br>  Breastfeeding does help loose weight. It may not feel like that though because your body is still in "pregnant mode." Its for the baby still at this point. <br>  So as long as you are breastfeeding the only thing I would suggest is HEALTHY eating. Still making sure you get those calories for your little one. And exercising, but who wants to do that!! lol. <br>  Definitely do not stop breastfeeding to please other people. It is solely up to you, and you do it when you are comfortable. <br>  You'll get the weight off in time. Do what is best for you and your baby!!|`|IDS64Eh8aa	I am in the same boat, my daughter is 7 months and in the 6 months after birth I gained 12lb, what the heck? I started writing down everything I was eating, found out the calorie content, I was actually consuming around 2 200 cal a day. I cut out 500 cal, have good 3 meals a day, around 500 calories each + fruit anv veg as snacks and I've lost 10 lb in just over 4 weeks!<br>  <br>  ETA: And I'm still breastfeeding, you can lose weight and breastfeed, trust me!:)|`|5DJcir9saa	Why do you think that weaning your baby would make you any thinner?  Its not breastfeeding that is making it harder for you to lose weight.  One, you are now older and as you get older the harder it is to lose weight.  Two, you have now had two children and your body is just going to be different..its been stretched out twice.  Eat healthy and exericse more than walking a few times a week.|`|irHF6CBPaa	Don't be sad your body made a beautiful baby also some women don't lose weight just by breastfeeding your baby takes a lot of nutrition from you and you need that extra fat to keep up with your baby|`|kc26mQCBaa	If you're hungry - perhaps you are cutting calories the wrong way. Try to eat a lot of good food with little calories, so that you're full but able to think clearly and not be hungry. If you aren't eating enough, you're actually slowing down your metabolism (that's why you aren't losing weight) As far as the relatives go, do not cut back on your food intake because it feels like you're being watched. Eat small amounts a little more often & speed up your metabolism. Use those snack size ziplock bags to put your snacks in, it will help with portion control. It also lets you have healthy food on hand to snack on. If they make a comment, just tell them your baby is worth a 'few' temporary pounds, and how could anyone disagree? Buy yourself something new to boost your confidence! You deserve it. Good Luck|`|zATQaiwIaa	As sad as i am to hear how nasty some of your relatives are - the last reason that should count for you to wean your child from your milk is what other people think of you.  I was only able to BF my first daughter for 3-4 weeks, and will try with this one - but in no way should you let other peoples opinions of you affect your judgment of your child - which is what is happening.<br>  <br>  And im not sure how old you are or how many years are between this child and your other - but as you get older it gets harder to remove weight, and that is just a fact of life.  Try eating HEALTHIER, instead of just cutting calories, more salads - change up the exercise routine bc your body can become accustome to it.<br>  <br>  best of luck to you - and ignore your nasty A** relations.  What you are doing for your child outweights the nasty things they have to say bc they are not comfortable in their own skin.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	First off, Shame on those relatives,  how dare they act so immature and shallow.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, you need to loose the weight for yourself, not for anyone else.  <br>  <br>  And third of all, I personally don't think you should wean your baby for a diet.  There are ways to diet that go safely along with breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding doesn't cause you to have a hard time loosing weight.  Breastfeeding burns at least an additional 500 calories a day.  So continuing breastfeeding is going to help you loose weight when you make some adjustments to your diet and your life style. <br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up about not loosing the baby weight yet either.  My son is almost 13 months,  and just a month ago I finally started trying to loose the baby weight.  I waited until I felt completely ready to diet and so far I haven't screwed up my diet once in the past month.  <br>  Why did I wait a year to start diet and more exercises,  I did it this way because I already had enough going on learning to adjust to having a baby,  struggling to keep up on all the things I needed to do, and just not having enough time to cook nutritious dinners every night.  I was at a point where I would rather order a little take out instead of struggling and balancing time with my son and trying to figure out and follow a diet. <br>  A little before my son turned a year, I decided I was ready.  And considering I was ready and had enough time to devote to a diet and exercise program, I have had much better success.  <br>  <br>  When you are ready start a diet and exercise.  I would contact a nutritionist.  Your doctor should be able to point you in the right direction and most insurance covers these appts.   <br>  It would be a good idea to seek a nutritionist's advice on a diet that would ensure proper nutrition while breastfeeding, and also help give you alternatives and different ideas for eating healthy.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I wish you the best of success, but really, don't feel sad.  There are a lot of mother out there that don't feel the need to jump right back to pre pregnancy bodies.  I didn't and I waited until I was ready and I have already lost about 15 lbs. in a little over a month!!!!|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I totally know where you are coming from. I heard from everyone that breastfeeding would help me lose weight, and I never lost a single pound from a week after I had my daughter until after Christmas (she is 9 months old). Although breastfeeding does burn more calories than not, moms also tend to eat more. Honestly, from not doing anything differently, I just suddenly started losing weight. I think that it might have been a hormonal thing (it happened around when my period came back). <br>  <br>  Anyway, a couple of weeks ago, we decided to go on a trip to Mexico, so I decided it was time to get serious. I upped my cardio and started some light strength training. I also started keeping better track of what I was eating. If you are serious about losing the baby weight, it is time to start getting a better workout and eating really well. It's not just about calories, it's also about nutrients. I checked with my doctor, and she said that cardio should not, in any way, decrease my milk supply. Strength training should only be done in moderation, however, because it may lead to lactic acid being released, which can alter the flavor of your milk. I only have 10lbs left to lose and can wear my pre-pregnant jeans again! You might just need to work harder to lose the weight than you did before. Unfortunately, breastfeeding isn't the ultimate weight loss solution.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Breastfeeding makes it easier to lose the weight because the baby is taking  out a lot of the calories. I think you need to go excersize a lot more, stop breastfeeding will do nothing and remember it is always harder to lose weight the second round.|`|FmC1TGm5aa	awwww! don't be sad! your relatives are jerks. period. if you really want stop them in their tracks, make a comment about one of each of their flaws that they're insecure about (job, intelligence, facial features, s/o, etc, etc). <br>  <br>  don't stop breastfeeding, though. it does help to lose weight because it takes ~900 calories a day to produce and breastfeed. So if you take the exact same diet and amount of exercise you have now, you'd actually GAIN weight when you stop breastfeeding. It will be easier for you to lose weight while breastfeeding than afterward, because you'll have to eat much less once you stop (those 900 calories will suddenly just be extra calories). So really if you just make a couple small changes now like cut out desserts and only eat fruits/veggies as snacks, you should start o see the weight come off more quickly (that's what has helped me).<br>  <br>  Take care, hun and shame on your mean relatives!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	if you want to lose weight weaning your baby is the last thing you want to do. With my first I had lost all but 7 Lbs (I gained over 60) and then he weaned himself at about 15 months and in less then 2 months I gained 15Lbs. It is going to be harder to lose the weight this time because you are older, you're going to have to work at it harder. Try joining a gym or taking a fitness class a couple of times a week and walking every day in addition to eating a well balanced diet and drinking lots of water. It will come off in due time. <br>  <br>  Also just to make sure because this happened to a woman I know, have you gotten your period back yet? if not you might want to take a pregnancy test. The woman I know was working out hard at the gym and cutting calories all over the place when her son was about 9 months old but instead of losing weight she gained 2 Lbs, she went to the doctor and found out she was 2 months pregnant with twins. She never got her period the whole time.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Well, I don't think it's the breastfeeding that is making you keep the weight on, it's probably a fact that you are a mom for a second time and just getting older.  The best way to combat this is with cardio.  Walking is okay, but you really won't get your dream figure that way.  Start slow, but try to do something that makes you sweat and breath heavily.  Add in some toning exercises to firm up the tummy.  <br>  <br>  I am 3 months postpartum, and 4 lbs. away from my pre-pregnancy weight. (I was 135, 5'8)   I jog at least 4 times a week, and do a toning DVD for my abs.  I also try to get the baby out for walks in the stroller, but I don't really count that as "exercise".
VKQzj4Pmaa	Elementary Students<br>  <br>  In general, research findings show that smaller classes are likely to be most beneficial for<br>  younger (elementary school) students, economically or educationally disadvantaged students,<br>  and exceptional students at both ends of the scale—gifted and disabled. <br>  (Source: Ellis, Thomas<br>  I., Class Size.

Because of this, when class sizes are close to the max, we parents are always trying to convince home-schooling parents & parents who have their children in other schools in the district (or private schools) to put their kids in our school for the year, so that they'll split the class & bring in another teacher.

I have taught almost 30, no aide. Children are just so needy (I mean that in a nice way), there have to be fewer of them so there's enough teacher to go around!<br>  Grade One - 17 to 19<br>  Grade Two - 20<br>  (When my son was in Grade Two, there were 29 of them - only 6 were girls. That was QUITE a year for both the parents and the students! We were lucky to have a lot of parent volunteers that year. I voluntarily taught a computer class with another parent assisting,  just to give the teacher some space.)<br>  Grade Three - 20<br>  any higher - 25.<br>  Of course, with any special needs children, there would be teacher aides if and when required.<br>  <br>  Also, if there are split grades - 20 kids the max (usually low/high split is best with more lower grade students, fewer of the independent higher grade students, eg. 12 grade twos, eight grade threes)<br>  My son encountered splits a lot, as he was in a bilingual school. When I taught in a small town school, same thing simply because of population.<br>  However, in a city school for example, I  taught 39 Grade Sevens - pure mayhem.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think most school divisions really do the best they can to keep the student/teacher ratios as fair as possible. They are professionals - and allotments are made in consultation with principals of schools, who project their needs each spring - then changes are made in the fall once attendance numbers are finalized.<br>  With all sectors making budget cutbacks - doesn't matter where you are - it's going to be tougher to keep primary classroom numbers low. After all, people complain all the time about how high their property taxes are (where I'm from, that's the majority of the funding of schools - I think 60%, with the rest picked up by the government), and it's a tough road.|`|AA11210211	I think the desired class size for me would be less than 10.I feel that children learn more when they have more one on one time with the teacher.As for research I have not ever looked so I have NO clue,but from my personal experience I did better at an alternative school that had only 30 students total because you get more attention rather than in a traditional school.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	My opinion is that 15 or less students is best in the elementary years, but I know that in most public schools, that just isn't feasible. <br>  I don' t know of any research...try google:-)|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I don't know what the optimal class size is but, my kids school starts a new classroom when the others all hit 20.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	What I consider optimal is 15 to 20 for K, and no more than 24 for the other grades.  To be truthful, other things can be more important than actual numbers.  Are there any children with behavior issues?  Even children with learning disabilities slow down the teacher.  It becomes a lot harder to manage a classroom when certain children are causing problems that need to be addressed often.  Even the rest of the children's personalities make a difference.  I, personally, think that there are many types of learning going on besides the 3 Rs.  Seeing unwanted behavior and consequences or adjusting to children with disabilities helps a child understand that people are all different.  They learn to adapt to less than optimal situations, which is truly how the world is in most cases.  But, I do think a good aid would be welcome in many classrooms.  We have parents able to volunteer in my daughter's K class of 19.  Even with 2 behavior issues and 3 others with learning issues, the class seems pretty sedate and manageable.  Other classes could be like a tornado hit it with one child who causes issues.  the same class my daughter is in this year was a disaster last year, because of this one little boy.  He finally bit the teacher (pretty darn hard) and was expelled.  The class became much easier to deal with after he left.|`|1gF9QVy9aa	Optimal would be 15-18 children.  <br>  <br>  In reality, I've seen a classroom that housed 30 children (2nd grade)....and it was highly destructive to any successful learning.  In those 30 children, some had learning disabilities which required specialized instruction, some were highly intelligent and bored most of the time, some children were hands-on learners that didn't get many opportunities to do so due to the size of the class and some children were average learners that were just stuck somewhere in the middle.  <br>  <br>  Our son attends a Catholic school and his class is up to 19 children (one new addition two weeks ago).  Typically....in public schools which is where I work the average class size is between 18-25 children.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	In a perfect world 1-5 children would be ideal for every teacher...just think of all the one-on-one and activities detailed to each child's specific needs you could accomplish in this setting!<br>  <br>  We clearly don't live in such a world.  I don't know about the actual research, but from experience it changes by grade.  The younger the students, the less of them need to be in that class.  (1st averages 18 per class, 4th averages about 25.)  Any more than 25 students to one teacher should be against the law.  That is insane.|`|AA10730513	I like this question. But I don't feel like looking up research today - I'm lazy. So I will share my personal thought process. <br>  <br>  My first instinct was to say 10 - 15 kids per class room. This size has worked well for my daughter and her friends. But now that one of the teachers got hurt and my daughter's 1st grade class room has grown to 19, she seems to be struggling more and not as happy with school in general. Plus, I know it has to be stressful on the teacher to be in charge of so many kids!<br>  <br>  My next thought was that 15 kids, 1 head teacher, and 3 teachers assistants would be perfect. Each kid could get plenty of 1 on 1 attention and it would be easy to break the class into 3 or 4 little groups for fun activities. ... But too much 1 on 1 attention can be a bad thing. What about the senses of determination and pride that come from having to work to figure things out on your own?<br>  <br>  So my final answer: <br>  <br>  12 - 20 kids, 1 head teacher, and 1 full time teachers assistant per classroom for pre-k, first, and second grade. (pre-k getting about 12 kids, second grade getting about 20) <br>  <br>  For third and fourth grade, stick with around 20 but give the teachers assistant 2 or 3 days off per week. ... They are still useful, but by now the kids should either have the basics mastered or they should be put into slightly smaller class sizes if they will need more individual attention. <br>  <br>  By 5th grade kids around here are changing class rooms for almost every subject. The answer will vary greatly by class. <br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  On a side note, I think it's odd that a licensed childcare provider can only watch 12 kids at a time but teachers are often expected to watch and do a good job of teaching twice that. ... education is so important. Especially in those early years when kids are trying to get down the basics.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	My daughter was in a class of 25 last year.  It was insane.  No one teacher should be expected to handle 25 kindergarteners.<br>  <br>  This year her class has 15 children.  They started with 17, but two have moved.  I like the smaller class.  When I speak to the teacher, she really KNOWS my child.  She gets a lot more individual attention this year than she did last year.  <br>  <br>  I know 15 isn't going to be the number every year, but I think any class with 20 or less kids is ideal.|`|dcqJjHN6aa	i would say 25 thats about 5 less than i had in elementary school but it doesn't always help having less kids because when the other kids understand it they  can help you and just because there is less kids still doesnt mean that kids will ask more questions.|`|tw1uePBbaa	20-25 i think is ideal.  its a practical number for the teacher to handle that number of students, especially if they have an aide from time to time.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Well, I'm guessing the teacher would have a different opinion...<br>  <br>  But I never saw any problem with classes between 25 and 35 students for the older grades (3,4,5, & up), but they should really be scaled back to under 20 for K,1, & perhaps even 2
AA11920812	I just had my first ultrasound today!!<br>  <br>  I think there are a lot of variables when it comes to the ultrasound. If the machine is older it may just be a quick look to see what they can see. My sister`s ob had an archaiec machine and they could just see the baby and nothing else. My ob at the time had a slightly less archaiec model, but nothing fancy and we could see the heartbeat (not count it though).<br>  <br>  Today, my new ob (my other closed his practice - medical insurance too high) had a state of the art machine. Wow. I was impressed! Flat screen monitor all kinds of fancy stuff and looked brand new. I saw the baby moving *big smile* and the heart beat *cry*. The machine is so fancy that he could measure and get me a more accurate due date. I had no idea that the date can very 2 weeks either way depending on ovulation and implantation. Mine was three days off. Interesting stuff.<br>  <br>  The heart is beating, but detectable just depends on the machine the doctor is using. If they can get a good reading they`ll tell you. My baby was a bit small and not sitting still very well so we didn`t get the beat even with the fancy machine. But, we could see it and that is comforting enough!! By your next appointment you may be able to hear the heartbeat and that is just awesome!!!<br>  <br>  *Wishing you a great ultrasound experience!*|`|98WKYtfwaa	Is it a transvaginal or abdominal?<br>  <br>  I've only had experience with abdominal ones, at 6w4d they should be able to detect the heartbeat and you'll see it on the screen. Your baby will probably look like a little blob. They check everythings how it's supposed to be and they usually tell you everything they're looking at and looking for. Don't be scared or shocked if no heartbeat has been detected because it's hard sometimes to find it at this gestation.<br>  <br>  Yes you'll get a photo to take home with you. <br>  <br>  Congrats & good luck|`|3K7ffKn2aa	nope you'll only see a bubble on the screen (the egg in ur uterus) and you won't get a pic (at least i didn't) there's nothing to see really. Its not that fun mine didn't even have a heartbeat yet.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	YOU WILL SEE WETHER THE BUB IS UGLY NOT|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	I had my first ultrasound at 8 weeks. They did take measurements of the uterus and baby. They also checked my ovaries and made sure everything else looked okay. I do not think that the heartbeat can be detected that early; however, mine was detected at 8 weeks. If they can see and hear the heartbeat they will be able to tell the beats per minute (expect it to be high since it is so early on). I definately got pictures of my first ultrasound so you should too! Good luck and congrats!|`|Cv0bGFiCaa	They will be looking for a heartbeat and fetal pole.  If they don't see one they may look at the gestational sac and yolk sac.  They want to make sure that everything looks normal.  If your baby doesn't have a hb yet they will likely want to followup with y ou so they can see if there is any growth and if a heartbeat is visible.  You should be able to get a picture to keep.|`|whYlVR2saa	i hope my experience is helpful to you: when i had my first sonogram i was exactly 6 weeks and four days, i had to go in because i was bleeding and they thought i may have miscarried ( everything is fine though!) first they said they were looking for my ovaries and stuff like that just to be sure everything looked healthy, and then they looked for the baby. it looked exactly like a black hole. it was hard to see anything inside of it at all. then the nurse showed me the "peanut" as he called it, and said that was my baby. he showed me a small blurry thing below it and said that was the yolk sac. then he took some picture things and switched the way the monitor looked so we could see the heartbeat. there were waves at the bottom of the screen showing me the beat. and the "peanut" had blue and red showing the circulation. after wards he said that they don't give out pictures before the second trimester. your doctor may let you have a picture though. they said you can't tell what anything is anyway. hope this helps you. congratulations!|`|6PEOqeLOaa	They look to see where the baby and the sac are located and make sure everything looks normal. they take measurements. they will show you the heart beat (you can see it on the screen they should tell you what the heart rate is.) and point out the yolk. they will answer any questions you have so if you have some make sure you write them down so you can ask.|`|0JHqXKciaa	I went for my first one when I was 5 weeks pregnant and they couldn't see much of anything just looked like a big blob lol!  They def couldn't hear a heart beat not until I was like 10 weeks did I hear that for the first time!  It's amazing when you do though and if you want to keep the pic of the first ultrasound just ask them for one!  congratulations on your pregnancy! good luck with everything :)|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! Okay so you will prolly be able to see a yolk sac (it looks almost like a lil cheerio!)  @ 6 weeks but don't panic. My 6 week one was just a yolk sac then the following week the fetal pole and heart beat were there!!!! They are prolly going to do a TV (transvaginal) ultrasound so they can get a good view of it! Its a lil uncomfy but if you relax it doesn't hurt as much!!! CONGRATS GIRLY!!!!!!!!!!!! <3<3|`|HkImCOSuaa	yes you will get a picture they will tell you if you r baby is good or not and if he or she is progressing right and you will get to hear the heart beat... good luck|`|AztPvbauaa	yeah all desired information would be disclosed.from baby heartbeat to size and just everything.make sure to ask anything you don't understand.congrats on your baby|`|VWyW8tJXaa	Are you having it done in a hospital or a doctors office. The hospital is way better for early pregnancies. They can see so much more. I had an ultra sound at 5 weeks to make sure the baby wasn't in my fallopian tube. Everything looked great, but no heart beat was found. I went back at 7 weeks 3 days and I got to see the heart beat! Everything was healthy and they gave me a pic. They let my husband come back and look at the heart beat too! You are only about a week behind me, so you might get this also. They used the ultra sound thing that they put inside you. The picture was so clear! They also tried it with the doppler (the one they rub on your belly), but couldn't find it that way.|`|9xviGNWkaa	Hiya! <br>  <br>  First off congrates!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes you will get to keep the picture of you new little  baby.  They look for the baby, sac, check out the uterous. Also they will measure the baby and tell you how many weeks he/she measures to be. Usually at 6weeks the heartbeat its not detectable BUT it is possible. However if you dont see it don't get worried or beat your self up about it. <br>  <br>  Last week I went for an ultrasound expecting to be 5 - 6 weeks pregnant but turns out im 8wks 4 days! lol who knew!|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Congrats! Sounds about the same what I went through  with infertility :) You will see a sack and a tiny baby (you can't really tell that it is a baby yet, lol). You might be able to see the heartbeat but I didn't til I was almost 8 weeks. The u/s will take about 2 min and yes, you will have a first picture of your baby :)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	They will have to do a transvaginal ultrasound, it sounds worse than it really is! They just take an ultrasound wand and put it in your vagina to get closer to the baby. The baby is tucked way in between your pelvic bones so it's not easy to see with a regular ultrasound. Make sure you drink 20 ounces of fluid 1.5 hours before your appointment and do not go to the bathroom during this time. You'll need to do this for any ultrasound at 20 weeks or less so they can see the baby better. They will try and hear a heartbeat, but if they can't hear it, don't stress, it's very common to not be able to this early. You should be able to see the heartbeat on the screen, you'll see a little blob and it will look like the middle of that blob is flickering and that's the heart beating. They will take a measurement and tell you exactly how far along you are and give you a due date and they will give you a picture or 2. It's very exciting! Good luck!
tvF86mRDaa	I hate to say this, and I really hope i'm wrong. But a friend of mine went for her a scan at 12 weeks (or so) and they said her body hadn't miscarried the baby but the baby was only grown to 8 weeks, indicating the baby had died at 8 weeks (hence the reason it hadn't grown at all). The had to wait a couple of days longer and then they induced a miscarriage for her as it hadn't happened naturally but they did confirm the baby had unfortunately died.<br>  I'm really sorry if that's frightening, but thought i'd put that out there just in case no one had explained that could be a possibility - I really hope its not the case for your friend.<br>  <br>  Rachael needs to go back to her doctor and get them to explain it to her again as she's doesn't seem to understand what's going on. either that or ring the NHS helpline??<br>  Good luck,hope it works out ok. x|`|HW89eJEZaa	twins?|`|j4lcMGmiaa	I had a similar situation...and it was around 3 months...it may not be the case for her, but it was because I was having twins.  They couldn't really tell me for sure until about 5 months...because my daughter hid behind my son...but that all I can offer on the subject...I'm sure others could offer more clear answers.  Good luck|`|qRDHEGHJaa	well my first thoughts was is she having twins? if she is worried bout the size of her babies i would say ask her doc what she can do if any hting to help out this problem good luck

Di7KqbVQaa	If the hormone level isnt doubling its more than likely that the pregnancy isnt progressing.<br>  <br>  You dont need to bleed just now, it may take your body a while to realise. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything, i am sorry.|`|NOasjhX6aa	i know a lot of people lately have been going to their scans at 12 weeks and realising that their baby has died at 7 weeks<br>  <br>  this is something to do with the development of the spinal cord<br>  <br>  x|`|AA11828121	It happend to me but I carried the baby to week 12 when it passed away at week 8...I never bled or anything, they ended up doing a D&C...

VwMkiLFPaa	My lovely electric company just approved an increase. 25%. So while we're losing jobs, can barely afford to keep food on our table, let's jack up the electric while we're at it. <br>  <br>  My bill has never been higher than $180 in the summer. (I live in FL) And we're in the "winter" and my bill was $279. <br>  <br>  Last month: $125. This month $279.<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  <br>  I live in Tampa also and it was COLD. It was in the 30's and you can only put on so many layers. Hence why my electric bill was jacked up last month too!<br>  <br>  Oh just SHOOT ME!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Wowsers! That sounds like a lot - but what exactly are the surcharges for - excess usage? Is your heat electric?<br>  I'm in western Canada, so we had weeks and weeks of -30 to -40 from December through end of January,  Jan. was pretty much -25s, and now in Feb, the days are maybe -15 and nights -20. This is Celsius (but -40 on both scales are the same. Zero Celsius is 32 F).<br>  We use natural gas for heat. For gas, we are able to go on equalized payments - so you pay the same amount all year round. So in the winter when you should be getting a big bill, we are still paying about $120. In summer, you still pay that amount, though you are only using gas to heat water. But it's much easier for budgeting.<br>  For power/electric bill, ours has gotten much higher over the past year. For our 1100 sq. ft. duplex, we pay about $100.<br>  <br>  Maybe you need to look into your home's energy efficiency - maybe not insulated enough, check windows, etc. Our gas company runs a program where they go to evaluate homes.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	lol, we live in a 6000+ sq ft house in western new york on the snow belt.  We still have electric so it must be ok.  However ours averages $240 a month with 7 people using it.  Perhaps you need a new electrical service? That sounds way to high for that size of a house.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	ours went up by about $150 from last month.  its sick.  apparently, the company raised their rates as of the 1st of the year.  must be nice as a company to raise your rates.  shame pay isn't in the same realm.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Our electric bill has been around $250 the past few months. During the spring when the weather is nice I will turn off the central air and open all the windows. This brings our bill down to about $130 usually. We live in Mississippi and have a one story house that is 2080 square feet.|`|m2jeeo4Laa	Ours is about $450 a month since December.  We have new windows, but an old furnace.  By the time we pay our gas/electric for the winter, we could have purchased a new energy efficient furnace to keep our bill as low as possible.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I'm in GA.  My electric bill is okay - around $100 to $150 a month.  My gas bill was near $300 for January, though!!  I was so angry!  January was a cold month, but come on.  We rent this house and it has vaulted ceilings, so I think we're heating a lot of empty space.  :P  Boo!|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I live in Indiana and ours went from $338 to $302.  We were without power for 3 1/2 days (due to the ice storm) so I guess our electricity usage is around $10 a day.|`|q9BItD25aa	I live in Florida St. Pete     85.00 last month<br>  My friend who lives in Tampa....400.00 last month .Instead of turning on the heat I put on warm clothes|`|nfzQkvqraa	I have had bills as low as 48.00.  Not this year.  In the three years we lived in this home my highest bill was 118.00.  Until last month.  It was 230.00.  Same with this month.|`|MI53mUKzaa	my power bill actually goes down in winter.  however my gas bill goes through the roof.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I also live in KY and mine was $300, I live in an extremely small 2 bedroom apartment! Mines usually about $100-$150 in the winter, so I was shocked. But you just made me thankful that it wasn't $500, but I think it's crazy.. my apartment is so little that if I stand in the doorway of my living room I can literally see the whole apartment. And right now as I'm sitting here my furnace is running non-stop, so I'm already preparing for the next bill. I also have a brand new "energy efficient furnace" Which obviously isn't all it's cracked up to be!|`|y0iXEYkvaa	My electric bill has more than tripled. It used to be $65.00 /month. Now its almost $225.00 /month. I live in Arkansas and I realize people in the northern part of the state had ice storms. I also know this has nothing to do with me so I am confused as to why my bill is so high.Especially since i turn off all my power in the house before the kids and I leave. Very puzzling...|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Mine was around the same. But, in this weather, I'd rather pay the bill than have my house like a freezer or cave !!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I live in Texas.  Our bill went down to $350 this past month.  We are pretty good about turning/ leaving lights off but are constantly having to change the thermostat (considering it can be 30 degrees one day here and 80 the next).  The highest ours gets is in July/ August (followed by Feb.) and is usually around $450-$475.  The lowest is usually $100.  Our home is 1937 sq ft, brick, 5 years old, 2 ceiling fans in living room and one in each bedroom, etc.  A few years ago we did change out all of our light bulbs and started using the energy efficient ones and I've noticed it has helped a lot.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I'm in Texas.  We have a one story 1750 square ft home.  Our highest electricity bill was $330.  The lowest was $157.  We have all fluorescent bulbs and we use a lot of natural light in the house (opening blinds, etc.)  We have ceiling fans that we use in the summer time and keep the house at a constant 72 degrees in the summer and 68 degrees in the winter.  We don't have gas appliances or a gas bill.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear that the electric company took advantage of a hard situation.  Some companies are just so underhanded.
nmu6coapaa	My son always gets it to when he's drools a lot lying down and it runs round the side of his face!|`|5h0nUQODaa	hey.. quite suddenly over the weekend  i came out in a rash that looked like heat rash all across my face, neck, chest, arms, back and stomach, it was a little clustery and more looked like little pink pimple marks everywhere but as it was getting worse over the weekend i booked an appointment...<br>  <br>   I went to the doctors today and she said as long as it dissappeared when it was touched and i wasn't feeling ill it should be fine - it just looked like a reaction from something or a viral rash.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	just keep an eye on it really! it could possible be heat rash!|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	Do keep an eye on her for other menningitis symptoms mean time - know as parents we all worry about this but better to be safe than sorry - high pitch scream, hard to wake up, going floppy all indicators too..<br>  <br>  That is just a precaution though - does not sound like it at the minute..<br>  <br>  It could therefore be a touch of eczema?  If so the Dr can give you a mild hydrocortisone cream to clear it up.  Wee soul x
WPI0Z47saa	Yes it is possible but not common. My mother conceived me during her period and actually had her period for the whole nine months with me. She tried to get pregnant right after having me but couldn't for 5 years. Here when she went to the doctor she found that she acually ovulates during her period. She went on to have two more children that way. So it does happen. Also sperm can live in the womans body for up to 7 days so if you ovulate the week after your period and have sex during your period, then you can become pregnant.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Yes you can get pregnant on your period.  Whether you're spotting or heavy bleeding doesn't really make much of a difference.|`|CC9MO4AJaa	Yes, you can get pregnant any day of your cycle.|`|fDOSnGpwaa	Yes, very true. Not sure about the second question.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	yes. but not a higher cnance than if she wasn't bleeding
5DJcir9saa	When you get up for the nighttime feedings just keep noise, lights, and distractions to a minimum.  But because she is only two weeks it may take her a while to catch on :)  My son was the same way.  Some nights he'd go right back to sleep and others he would think its time to play.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Most babies that young have no concept of "nighttime is for sleeping."<br>  <br>  I read a study done on newborn infants that had serious gastrointestinal issues that required them to be fed via feeding tube constantly.  They were never hungry.  They still woke up every 3 hours.  This is simply the natural rhythm of newborns.<br>  <br>  It's rough, but soon you will notice slightly longer chunks of sleep at night.  These will naturally grow longer over time.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	It does take a while for them to learn the routine on the outside! lol.  Make sure there are difference between day and night routine.  Daytime chat alot, lots of light, music, etc and nighttime keep lights low, no talking during diaper changes, slow, gentle movements, things like that.  It will take awhile for her to get it but she will.  Their little clocks have no concept of day or night when they are in utero so it's all a matter of them learning the routine you teach them.|`|rFRo6DGTaa	soon he will realize that its not party time at 3am :)<br>  when my daughter would wake up for her night time feedings I would make sure lights were off and no sounds, I would talk really soft to her, and during the day even if I wasn't watching it I would have T.V or music on even when she was taking her naps, so that she would know that day time is brighter and louder and night time is dark a quiet.  I hope this helps a little.  By 8 weeks she was sleeping through the night 8-10 hours, It was wonderful, now at 6 months shes starting to wake up once or twice at night, I think they just go through patterns, I know it can be exhausting with getting up  in the middle of the night, but it does get better.  good luck!|`|QjdbyqtNaa	I had the same problem as you with my newborn son.. I found this site: www.yap2nap.com and just put him to sleep with white sound every night at the same time after feeding him until it makes the habit. It worked for me, I don't know maybe you could give it a shot.|`|TBNaPkl6aa	She's still very young and it will probably take her a couple more weeks or so to really understand the difference between night and day.  Remember, she needs to recuperate from her birth too!  :)  <br>  <br>  That being said, I have been in your situation and I know it's rough.  I think it took my daughter about a month to start sleeping soundly at night and "know" it was night time.  What helped was:<br>  <br>  1. being patient and letting her get used to the world outside the womb<br>  2. during the day, if she had to nap, I kept things bright and went about my "normal" routine.  I didn't tiptoe around the house or anything like that.  On the contrary, at night, everything was dark and quiet.  My daughter understood the difference eventually.<br>  3. After about a month, it did help to give my daughter a bath and a nice relaxing feeding before bed.<br>  4. Swaddling helps!!!  Swaddle at night especially.<br>  5. Ask your doctor if you still need to wake your baby for night feedings.  My doc told me that it's not necessary after a couple weeks, as long as the baby's growing all right.  But again, ask your doc!!!
miPubuDYaa	1 weeks doesn't make a difference. <br>  <br>  2lbs 12 oz is in the normal range for someone who is 28 - 29 weeks. you are doing well.<br>  <br>  Thought you do not want your baby to come yet. Even though the fetus is viable at 28 weeks. The chances of survival are still to low. The baby head can turn at any time and be sideways or even have her feet at the cervix. They still have some room to move around.<br>  <br>  2 weeks ago at my 28w doctor visit my son too was head down. I got excited too. Over the weekend i had these horrible pains, they feel like waves of pain and my hubby rusehed me to the hospital. Turns out my son was laying sideways and pushing his head into my side.<br>  <br>  You still have 12 weeks.|`|uuHPneEcaa	yes ur baby is at a good weight since ur only 29 weeks.<br>  <br>  according to i-am-pregnant.com ur baby should be atleast 2.7 ibs. and should be around 10.4 inches long.|`|Cv0bGFiCaa	I had an U/S at 27 weeks and my bambino was 2lbs 13oz.  I asked if this was normal as he seems large.  They said that he was in the normal range and that alot of the weights and measures that they give on the internet can be low. You could be farther along -  the due dates given at the earlier U/S tend to be more accurate as the older the fetus gets the more it grows on their own schedule.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	Sounds about normal to me, since babies don't generally start gaining the majority of the birth weight until the last month of pregnancy. Remember the weight your doctor gave is only an estimate to. My doctor told me on my last visit that my baby was about 8 lbs and when he was born he was 9 lbs and 8 oz. Hope this helps.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	Actually a baby at 28 weeks is supposed to on average weigh between 2lbs-3 1/2 lbs. As for the pressure I have no clue cause my son sat up high until they induced me. If you are worried I would call the doctor.|`|drDpM6opaa	that is a good weight maybe by the end of ur 40 weeks u could have a 9lb baby lol good luck|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Yes it is normal for your baby to be 2lbs and 12oz (i checked what to expect while your expecting) however im not sure how you know how big your baby is at this point. i was just at the doctors and asked if and when they would give me another ultrasound to see how big my baby boy is. my doctor told me there is no accurate way to determine a babies weight until delivery. My mom also happened to be at my appointment and shared with me that she had an ultrasound done with my brother and they told her he was going to be 6lbs and he turned out to be 10lbs and 7 oz<br>  <br>  seriously sounds like you think about having your baby early all the time and this is why you have early labor. your baby is 2lbs she is not ready to come out! she has so much more growing to do and will have a healthier life if you if you continue to be her life support. The hospital can not give her the same advantages as you can give her. plus she wont be able to go home until she is atleast 6lbs so she would have to stay in the hospital for weeks. relax you only have at least 8 weeks to go you can do it hold in there good luck!|`|QeVMp1W5aa	You are right on Target. Im sitting here looking at "The new Pregnancy week by week" which i live by it helps the time pass. the baby should weigh 2lb 7 oz at 28 weeks and her length from crown to rump , will be about 10 in. <br>  I am going on 32 weeks and i too feel like my little one is pushing his way out lol I guess it's just all the pressure or they could just have big heads:~) any way i hope i helped good luck with the rest of your pregnancy|`|NOasjhX6aa	yeah that is normal, also the more early babies you have the more likely your next baby will be early<br>  <br>  for example i was 3 weeks early.. my mams next baby was 5 weeks early. maybe ur body is just preparing itself for another early baby<br>  <br>  i would ask your midwife to be double sure =) x
423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Depends on the name.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	I like unusual names in general, but NOT common names with changed/unusual spellings. That is just weird, or trying too hard to be different without picking a name that is, in and of itself,  "different" or unique.<br>  <br>  I really don't get the whole "leigh" thing.<br>  <br>  Haleigh? Baileigh? Kaleigh?...<br>  <br>  Ashleigh????  Please, that is just Ashley... a very COMMON girl's name. There is nothing unusual, unique or creative about the way it is spelled.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	Normal (ie. traditional). I absolutely HATE "trendy" made up spellings of perfectly normal names. It's NOT cool, and the child will have to live with it their entire life, with people constantly mis-spelling it.|`|VPOaunmvaa	I like normal spellings apartfrom these names-<br>  <br>  Brayden (boy) - Braedon<br>  Jayden (Girl)- Jaedan<br>  Jayden (boy) - Jaden/ Jaiden<br>  May (girl)- Mae<br>  <br>  I like them better lol.|`|7f9M7kyYaa	Different, so they arent like anyone else<br>  And normal, becasue then people wont misspell it so much,<br>  I dont know, i like both!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yeah i do nothing to crazy but i like em a little different. Sometimes they just look better different.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Normal spellings. I don't know, I think it looks un-educated when the name is spelled really crazy.|`|R1cey1Evaa	It depends on the name. EG: Riley, no. Katelyn, yes|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	It really depends on the name for me.<br>  <br>  As for the name "Victoria" i think its really cute spelt: Viktoria.<br>  & Rebecca, i like: Rebekkah<br>  <br>  Now as for: Names like "Mason", "Landon", "Brayden", "Lacey", & "Jessica" i prefer them spelt the traditional way. But ive seen them spelt like:<br>  <br>  Mayson, Macen, Maisen<br>  Landyn, Landan, Landen, Landin<br>  Bradin, Braedynn, Breydin<br>  Laycee, Laicee, Lacea<br>  Jessika, Jeasica<br>  <br>  Just my opinon|`|hkn0az4xaa	i think the traditional spellings are better because other wise the kid will have to spend their life correcting people. Names like Kellie,Kelley,Keli, i t looks pretty spelled differently but it sounds just the same as Kelly(the most common way of spelling it) my friend spells it kellEy and she has to constantly tell people they spelled it wrong and stuff|`|gaVRH4cHaa	I prefer traditonal spellings. 1 reason being that if you only know someone by meeting them in person and you've never seen their name in writing you could have no idea how to spell it! What if you are meeting them for birthday drinks or something and you get them a card, you look like an @ss if you spell their name wrong.|`|j01zBZmZaa	As a teacher, give your children normal spellings, even if the name is unique. I have five Brittanys and four Megans right now. Not a single one in either set is spelled the same! Traditional spellings will make your school-aged child's life easier.|`|WlSsUf7raa	I like it. Because it gives a person a sort of uniqueness. And no one else can take that from them.<br>  Like me friend. He spelt his name. Aleix. With an I. Instead of just Alex.<br>  <br>  And plus. It can make a person seem more interesting.|`|ZWVvtIK8aa	Thats hard.. it really depends on the person and the name... My sisters name is spelt Danyelle, and she loves that it has a y instead of an i, but i know a lot of people hate having there said or spelled wrong on the time...|`|US33hgbJaa	Depends. If you're changing the spelling of a name from Sarah to Sara, I don't see the big deal.<br>  <br>  But if you're thinking Rayyvin Moonshynee or Madyson Nikkole then, no, definitely not. Stick to the classic.s|`|UpRdvpmXaa	I like different ways of spelling a normal name. That way it isn't the same as everyones and people will have to think before they right it. <br>  <br>  Instead of Lorelei ->Laurelie|`|MTSg2dkDaa	Usually normal because the modified versions often sound chavvy. Like when the french name chantal is changed to chantelle|`|SjrhuZQnaa	Depends on the name, but normal i like varies because some names sound more exiotic.|`|SToOdHj1aa	The normal spelling!  Spelling things wierd makes people look like illiterate assholes.|`|KiGIzZc0aa	i like names that aren'tt spelled the way they should. it means that they are unique and gives you a sense or creativity. :]|`|V3NQKYzdaa	Mostly I like traditional spellings. Sometimes the way people spell things is just silly.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Normal proper original spellings because they are the nicest.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	Different varies of spellings(:<br>  <br>  <br>  I dont know why just most the time they look cuter(:|`|xCeaVqItaa	All depends on the name. Some look weird if you try to mess with the "original" spelling.|`|Hqzbhfvjaa	heck yea! thats called unique|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Normal.<br>  <br>  Kids with "wrongly" spelt names are less likely to be thought of as intelligent by their teachers - even if they have exactly the same level of results as their peers with normally spelt names. That's all the reason I need. I would never do ANYTHING to bias people against my kids.|`|AA11138222	I like normal spellings of names the best. My reasoning is plain and simple. For one, spelling a name different does not make it unique, because it is still pronounced the same. Two, the child will go through their whole life correcting all the people in the world that automatically spell it the way it is "normally" spelled.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No I don't.  And the reason I don't is that the person with the unusual spelling will have to speak his or her name to others for all their life.  Any deviation causes problems.  My husband's name is Ray, for example, and people keep writing down his name as Raymond.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	It depends on the name and the spelling some choose. Some people spell things and it looks so ghetto. I am naming my daughter Paityn and choose to spell it different to make it a little more girly.|`|v6DRUwH7aa	Traditional spellings.|`|WPI0Z47saa	It depends on the name.
7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I worked at a homeschool group for and we used starfall.com for spelling and learning the alphabet. Also enchantedlearning.com was useful. It kept the kids busy. You can also look at things like pbskids.org to see if they have any educational games.<br>  <br>  EDIT: for the people who say that video games and learning sites are unhealthy, she didn't ask for a website that would raise her kids for her. Just one to enhance learning.|`|AA10556677	Stick to reading to your kid EVERY night, giving him supplemental homework (especially math), and taking day trips to museums. Video games are not educational, no matter how well Nintendo and these other companies tell you that they are. Video games are video games. They are entertainment.<br>  <br>  My parents, right around when we got my first Nintendo, made it a rule that I was only allowed to play video games and weekends. I hated it at the time, but in retrospect, it was necessary to keep me focused on schoolwork. I'm 17 now, and will be going to UC Berkeley in the fall (unless I get into one of the Ivies). As a teen who loves video games, I'm telling you: don't convince yourself that there's any redeeming value in them. They're fun, but they can make you stupid.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	i would say to get your child an educational gaming system. children these days are too young and getting onto all kinds of sites they shouldnt be because they were exposed to the internet too young. just look at how many 10-15 yr olds on here are asking about sex love and pregnancy, i would be willing to bet their parents dont know.|`|qlgvecs9aa	nickjr.com<br>  they have games, print outs and lot of fun things to do.|`|IybV1Enwaa	Try to find what websites they are using at schools. Sometimes the school has websites named on schools and you can use those. Alternately you can use free websites of other schools. Other than that I also do not recommend too much internet exposure. Kids should be encouraged to read paper books. Take them to library as often as you can. Take them to library and community events.|`|yGAPvstLaa	try <br>  <br>  www.noggin.com<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  www.pbskids.org<br>  <br>  These are my daughters favorite|`|hKJIDdVqaa	pbskids.org<br>  nickjr.com|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	tryscience.org<br>  <br>  <br>  we also like the popular mechanics for kids dvd series, if you let them watch any tv.  Netflix even has them, and our library.<br>  <br>  I think they have one on sea creatures :)

They have a food pyramid for babies and tots too. It shows how much of each food group a child at each age should get and also explains the different sizes for each age. it states that a typical serving for a baby-tot from 12 months on is 1 table spoon for each year of age! I thought that was rather small but then I realized that really is all he eats. I've also been advised from other websites/magazines not to let him graze throughout the day because it will spoil his meals. However, I've noticed since he stopped grazing he's cranky more and sleeps a lot more. I found on this website that they need that "grazing" to keep up throughout the day. Toddlers go through a lot mentally that we can't even begin to understand so they wear down quickly. The grazing helps with that.

LqpNve02aa	Your body is craving things because your hungry. Breasts are tender because you have built up hormones that cannot come out because your stressing your body out because you think your preggo and your not. And your 14 for F*cks sake, stop F*cking boys and hang with your friends. Dear God, what's wrong with kids today. I was playing Barbie and hanging out with the girls at 14, boys were still icky. I'm 28 and boys are still icky!!! <br>  <br>  Ps i'm divorced from the guy i dated at 15.

If you have taken the test properly and they showed negative you are more than likely not pregnant.  Morning sickness usually doesn't show until later in the pregnancy.  Tender breasts can be a sign of your period on the way.|`|AA12069058	If all the test say negative then your not pregnant. The rest of the "cravings" and "tender breast" is all just you being worried.

My baby shower is the weekend too, I'm so excited, this is our first so we don't have a lot of things yet, and it's so late in the pregnancy that I'm getting nervous about things not being "done" yet. <br>  <br>  And as far as dealing with the home stretch, I don't think I am doing a very good job. I'm grumpy and miserable and moody...lol. My poor husband!

BXd4I9mmaa	Yeah you are getting close...

Yes, it is only a matter of time now.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|MtC3CWZraa	The leakage doesn't mean anything. Your mucus plug can come out anywhere from weeks before labor to after labor starts.  There really isn't a good predictor of when it will happen.|`|W1p6LetFaa	It means you're close, but not necessarily there.  You could go today, but it still could be a few weeks yet!

Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|GlzVQclpaa	Well leaking nipples just means your breast are getting ready to start producing milk.

There is nothing that will make this go faster.  It will be on her own time and all you can do is be supportive and be there when she needs you but don't force yourself on her.  I am so sorry for your families loss. God Bless|`|ex53YwSuaa	Well, first you'd take this off here because I'm sure she doesn't want some rapist coming after her since he now knows all of her personal information...<br>  And then, you'd give her a Coke. And some Sour Patch Kids.<br>  Those always know how to cheer people up :)
dO4xX4Hvaa	when baby's are entering a new stage in their life - learning to sit, crawl etc - they lash out and act differently ie the mood changes. Even though it may be frustrating just try to be patient and hopefully she'll be back to her old self in no time,|`|lWVgQYs8aa	I have an almost 6 month old. We went through the same kind of thing. Its been awhile ago so it may not be the same thing. But for us, it was because she had a lot of gas. So she would be happy then upset because she would get a strong pain in her stomach. At her age it is hard to tell what the pain is, so she would then think that she might be hungry. We would go through the same process of trying toys and stuff because we weren't sure what it was, she shouldn't have been hungry. We had to put her on the Gentle Ease formula. She is doing much better now, but she will still do it some. Now I think it just comes with the age. She wants to do soo much, but cant figure out how! So, in your case, if you can easily rule out gas, I would say its part of the age. They want to do soo much at this age, that sometimes its easy for them to get frustrated and overwhelmed. Try giving her some good down time, with less distractions, so she is less likely to get overstimulated.    <br>  <br>  Hope it helps... =]|`|CYcqQb6Caa	i think that you should Talk to her doctor and see what they say. most of the time this kind of thing is normal. hope this helps

Just take it easy.|`|R7lAURjWaa	Yes. I'm 5 months pregnant and still having sex. I actually find it quite nice having sex now because before we had the concern of me getting pregnant and people have to choose some type of protection whether it's condoms, pills, patches... Well now that I'm pregnant we have nothing to worry about and don't have to use protection, and as long as you both know you don't have HIV or an STD, you don't have to either :) Greatest sex you'll both have... and next month when she enters her second trimester, at least from my experience and many others, she'll be wanting more than usual.|`|Lb6FGaTEaa	As long as your not told to stay away from sex|`|IEZoHcysaa	As long as the doctor hasn't told her not to.
Q05rrSX4aa	Means: Treeless Plain<br>   <br>  From the English word for the large grassy plain, ultimately deriving from the Taino (Native American) word zabana. It came into use as a given name in America in the 19th century. It was revived in the 1980s by the movie 'Savannah Smiles' (1982).|`|UQWusO1waa	girl lying down covered in grass|`|7Q7dFghmaa	It's a town in Georgia.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|59715d7e62197c5b33547a43b86b1f18aa	Savannah is basically a girls name and is usually pronounced as sa-VAN-ah.

dDVAUA9saa	Yes.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yeah with my first pregnancy I didn't feel pregnant until I was about 5 - 6 months along!  I felt totally normal and great, no sickness, nothing!<br>  <br>  My second one has been totally different.<br>  <br>  Don't worry it is VERY early, you got a LONG ways to go!  Enjoy it now while you can!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Very normal.  Some women have no symptoms while others have them all.  I was one of the ones that had symptoms sometimes but not always.  There we times that I didn't believe I was pregnant because nothing was going on.  But yes, very normal!!|`|65RZ441Zaa	well if you took a test, a HPT or blood test, and it says your pregnant, you are.  I wouldn't worry about not having enough symptoms, you should feel lucky you have less symptoms then most of us :)<br>  congrats!!|`|ihL0FkJYaa	yes|`|3w7VztEWaa	Yurp.|`|CbKOO4HFaa	I don't know if it is normal, but I've experienced the same thing.  I'm at week 10 right now, and the tenderness has been off and on since week six.  Also, I didn't feel pregnant either until the middle of week 6, and that's when the morning sickness came.  I haven't felt too tired or moody - just nauseous and sporadic sore breasts.|`|kHmDUPsraa	Thanks for asking this question!  I too am about 5 1/2 weeks along and my breasts have ranged from very sore to not at all.  Overall, they are sore, but they definitely fade and then get really sore again day to day.  I'm so happy when they are the most sore because I feel certain that I'm pregnant!  I've been researching online to make sure this is normal and I think it's just what is normal for our bodies!|`|794ce872c4136d0aaf2a1468ff7adbdbaa	Yes its normal...you'll start to feel pregnant in a couple more weeks. You're pretty early, you know most ladies dont have any symptoms during the first 5-7wks...the only reason they test is because they're late, not so much because they feel sick or sore.|`|ibR8TkDiaa	YES IT'S NORMAL YOU WON'T FEEL PREGNANT UNTIL YOU ATSRT FEELING THE BABY MOVE AROUND 5 MONTHS GOING ONTO SIX AND CONGRATS|`|uoS1QwObaa	No.  Yes.   What?
zATQaiwIaa	you only need to take a prenatal vitamin.  An overload on vitamins is just as bad as not having what you need.  The OTC vitamins are just as good as what the doctor can prescribe you - and sometimes the ones they prescribe make women sick.  I took nature made prenatals with my first and am taking them with my second as well  - i am due at the end of Mach<br>  <br>  Congrats and best of luck|`|53GH38Qiaa	ONLY take prenatals. There are certain vitamins that you do not want to overdose because they can cause harm to your baby. If you want something to take until you go to the doctor you can always just take flint stone vitamins. I'm taking equate children's vitamins from walmart because they are exactly the same as the flint stones. I chose these because many doctors recommend it for women who get sick from their prenatals. Also because compared to the price of prenatals, the equate vitamins are only $8 for a 150 tab bottle.<br>  <br>  ADD: forgot to mention the childrens vitamins had the same  levels as the prenatal recommendations on webmd.com|`|S5n5Za78aa	i would make a doctors appt instead they give you real prenatal vitamins  <br>  congrats tho|`|sK67bBy5aa	Congrats!!!!|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I was told to switch to a prenatal because multiviatmins lack in other vitamins you need while you are pregnant, not just folic acid. I take a prenatal and extra folic acid but that was prescribed by my OB for a blood clotting disorder I have.|`|dlOFWcU4aa	I would take an over the counter prenatal vitamin only until you see your doctor.  Congrats to you!!!|`|qDeYLR02aa	get on prenatal care go to the doctors today <br>     congrat's|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Wow!!!!  Congratulations dear!!!!<br>  <br>  I would get off the multivitamin and stay on the prenatal vitamins.  If you take both together it could be bad.  Too much in the vitamin sense is bad for the baby, but the prenatal is designed for yours and babies health together.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	first of all congrats on your news. I would take the prenatal vitamins until you can get in to the doctors but i am Pretty sure that they will tell you to stay on the prenatal vitamins. best of luck to you and baby dust to all ttc..
98WKYtfwaa	There is a chance that it could have, but it might have been some other reason such as lacking a certain hormone that's needed to grow the baby, or a fetal abnormality and your bodys just gotten rid of it. <br>  <br>  Either way, you should definitely see your doctor and ask questions like this. <br>  <br>  I smoked with my first pregnancy and that ended in miscarriage, with this one i stopped before TTC and everythings fine.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Smoking more than doubles your chance for miscarriage.  It restricts oxygen and blood flow to your baby, so that could have played a role in the miscarriage.  It's best to quite smoking and drinking BEFORE trying to conceive.  Good luck and I hope that doesn't happen again!|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	Yes it is possible it does say on the box that it can cause birth defects and low birth weight. I am not sure about miscarriages but its best to stop if you plan to have a baby not just for the babies health but yours too.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	yes it may have done! smoking increases your risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, birth defects and stillbirth! if you are trying for a baby i suggest you quit smoking for the sake of your baby and your own health too!|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Non smokers have miscarriages too. That's all genetics.<br>  My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|Di7KqbVQaa	yes. Just because your friends have been fine doesnt mean to say you will be. This is my 1st child but 3rd pregnancy. I smoked with the others and miscarried. This time I havent and I am nearly 10 weeks. i dont know if its related but who knows. <br>  Smoking during early pregnancy does increase the risk of miscarriage, that is a fact. But some people seem fine. maybe you're just one that cant do it. I just dont want to risk it anymore, i can go on dealing with miscarriages.|`|0JHqXKciaa	well maybe if your're trying to get pregnant u should quit smoking....dunno if it caused it but why not have a doctors visit to determine why you have had 2 miscarriages...and why would anyone smoke at any stage of their pregnancy it's ignorant...|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is quite possible. Quit smoking now so it doesn't happen again.|`|ihL0FkJYaa	yes that could have done that|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Some bodies are more highly sensitive than others so it is possible the smoking could have been a contributing factor.  If you are actively trying to get pregnant, smoking,  drinking and illegal drugs should be the first things that are stopped.  And if you've experienced 2 miscarriages it's time to speak to a physician.  If you aren't trying to get pregnant you may want to consider a form of birth control that works for you and you are comfortable with.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	yes, unfortunately

You can go there and look into what's called "Plan B"--it's basically a two-step morning-after pill specifically designed to deal with situations like broken condoms and such. It's fairly cheap as well.<br>  <br>  If you want you can also google it and read about what it does and how it works. The sooner it's taken though, the more effective it is.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	How long ago did this happen because like the others said you can take plan b if it wasnt that long ago take it in the time frame it tells you. But I know people like me cant do something like that.I would feel I killed a baby. If you cant do that then wait until your expected period and take a hpt or have a blood test done. If you decide to take the plan b you will experience some bleeding and cramping from what I have read.|`|ZzjUHawhaa	i'm sorry but you have to wait and c at least 5 days after a missed cycle. it can take up to 48 hours to get pregnant if u are not already. if u have some vaginal constraceptive use that to help kill the sperm. if u are already preggers it will not terminate the pregnancy. it only helps kill sperm thats it. call a clinic and they should be able to help get you the stuff you need:)|`|ce95cc4f2dc353f5d8d43928830e0252aa	Go get Plan B from Planned Parenthood.

MlshtGVTaa	well if the hospital can't record to DVD just have them record it to the VHS and then have your local video expert port it over to DVD for you. but if your just saving pictures it doesn't matter if you have it on DVD-R or CD-R then will store just fine.|`|AA12336620	I would ask the hospital if they are going to put pictures on the cdr or record the video.  It is just pics then go with the vhs.  If its video, go buy some cdr's|`|1bnhwGACaa	most cd-r are dvd-r it just depends <br>  check that out but i would go for the cd-r you can buy a pack for like 6 dollars for 5 of them <br>  i used the others to load all my pics on to to i had backup if my sd card crashed
HmkCFddAaa	Get the death certificate. Then contact a lawyer and they will take care of the paperwork. The lawyer can advise you of what needs to be done for the guardianship and for the adoption. Since the death certificate isn't ready yet go ahead and contact a lawyer that way you can get things started. You want the lawyer to handle all the paperwork so that you know everything is legal|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Yes, you'll need a death certificate.  People can't just walk into courthouses and get custody of children with no documentation.<br>  <br>  You need to hire a lawyer to process the legal guardianship documentation.   Perhaps after the natural father of the child has been given the opportunity of parenting his child.<br>  <br>  Once adopted the genuine birth records of your niece will be sealed by the State and she will never be able to access them.  Do you really want this.   Legal Guardianship won't do this so that's the best option for her to keep her original identity.|`|HxAyoEQVaa	You will need all the paperwork you can get.  And yes your husband should be there. I dont know if he has to be their but you have alot more to do before that child can just come into your home. But I hope you do that for that poor child.

sOSk3RhQaa	There are new suggestions now of more starchy foods and a bigger selection.  (See link below).  Just avoid things that tend to loosen stools such as dairy and high sugar drinks like fruit juice.  <br>  <br>  Depending on the virus, it can be 24 hours or as long as 72 hours.  As long as your child is drinking fluids and not becoming dehydrated, they will most likely not need to go to the doctor.  However, watch their skin turgor carefully (pinch gently and make sure the pinched skin goes back immediately.  If it doesn't that's a sign of dehydration).  <br>  <br>  Here's the link.  Good luck.  That's always awful.|`|pRpUBJDzaa	um my baby  brother had diarrhea for about 4 to 5days<br>  and no we never used BRAT|`|tIg3low2aa	Pedialite seemed to be the only thing that worked for us!

(although Ive probably just jinxed myself)|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Pedialite!|`|u53ISZoXaa	I give my daughter pedialyte and a lot of starchy foods.  Toast, dry cereal, grahm crackers, and saltines.  The rice is good, but I would avoid bananas and especially applesauce.  It usually takes about 3-5 days for the diarrhea to stop depending on how serious the viris is.  Sorry your little one doesn't feel so good, get well soon!|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Make sure you give them something to elevate their electrolytes..."PEDIALITE" is great for that and water,too.....(do not give your little one Gatorade, there is too much sugar in it, and that will make the diarrhea worse, no matter how old he/she is). If the diarrhea lasts more than 24 hours, give your pediatrician a call. I would LEAVE THE APPLESAUCE OUT, too...some kids have a problem with that and their bowels. A baked or boiled potato and pasta is good, but light on the butter. Hope your child feels better.|`|hfqUp1IBaa	Applesauce has a ton of fiber which helps promote bowel movements.  I would attempt something with potassium if the child is no longer vomiting like cheese or bananas.  Good luck and avoid applesauce!|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Usually around 2-3 days. The BRAT diet sounds about right !!
Fy9S6hjIaa	The main difference is that Aquaphor is water based while vaseline is petroleum based.  Vaseline acts as a shield and doesn't let the diaper contents irritate the rash.  Aquaphor not only acts as a shield, it also soothes and moisturizes.  Its really great stuff. I use it all the time.  I've never had anything work as well for a diaper rash.  A close second is A&D ointment.  Its really good too.  I used it until I discovered Aquaphor.  From my personal experience I would advise against anything like Desitin that is white and creamy.  I know all kids are different, but any of that stuff honestly made my son's rash worse.|`|eytlIKITaa	No, they're not the same thing...  Totally go out and get Aquaphor!  That stuff is absolutely amazing!  I use it on everything!  Anytime there's a cut, burn, dry skin, even on my dog's nose (it get's chapped sometimes)- my answer is always "Put Aquaphor on it!"...|`|rHoj4coQaa	Aquaphor is better for chapped skin. I've used it on my daughter. But i think the best thing for diaper rash is a doctor prescribed zinc oxide. My daughter had problems with diaper rash and that stuff worked wonders.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	No, they are not the same.  I worked for a dermatologist for a bit and she told everybody to use Aquaphor.  It's good stuff.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	different ingredients but feel the same.. both will keep out moisture. See if Vaseline works first because Aquaphor is SO expensive.|`|BypjotRpaa	my pediatrician suggested vaseline.. use damp paper towels to wipe (wipes can irritate) let air dry as long as possible, thin coat of any diaper rash cream with zinc and then glob on the vaseline... do this for every diaper change
kCiizn5oaa	No I would have put enviromental family as the majority with genetic then friends.
eayVCgUZaa	Nope<br>  if you break your hymen during sex you won't even feel it<br>  you might bleed if it breaks during sex but the pains not any better<br>  but also you can use a pain killer like advil or tylenol<br>  hope it helps. good luck :)|`|8j7FCEOraa	I hear tampons can break your hymen?<br>  <br>  But you know what, I never did any kind of physical exercise like horse back riding and my first time never hurt, its different for all women.<br>  <br>  Secondly, even if its not all that painful your first time its not going to be all that great. It's going to be awkward, its just a new experience. Dont get your hopes up, it is going to be something that will get better with time.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	i have no idea|`|vhFnxBNeaa	um i can't say by personal experience due to the fact that i'm still a virgin. but as others have said all women are different and in most cases theres no way to avoid a little pain because of the fact that your body has to stretch lol make sure hes little!!!|`|a6hQftotaa	Well if you tear it, it will still hurt when you have sex.<br>  But If you break it, it wont hurt as much because it is already broken.<br>  If you think you broke it, it's probably teared if you didn't have sex yet|`|6L9jJnchaa	At least you know about the important stuff (lube, etc.)  Tht's really what makes it more enjoyable.  I honestly don't know about how much less painful it would be if your hymen was already broken.|`|AA11945637	Yes , it hurts less.<br>  I had this experience|`|IH0kLuwZaa	whether your hymen is broken or not your first time is not suppose to hurt if you are a hundred percent sure your body will know and self lubricate as long as you're relax and sure you should be ok my first time didn't hurt at all because i had this knowledge<br>  <br>  good luck hope i was some kind of help|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I used to be a dancer, and my hymen broke when I was a young kid.  Sex for the first time still hurts because you are stretching something that has never been stretched.  Plus, I still bleed a tiny bit.  It may not hurt for you, but chances are there will be a little bit of pain.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	I broke my hymen from track before I had sex for the first time.<br>  The first time I had sex still hurt.<br>  Any type of trauma near your hymen or hard activities can break or stretch the hymen.|`|i03qjBEfaa	Unfortunately no. If it does it wouldn't be by a noticeable amount.|`|LqpNve02aa	no. I broke mine in a bike accident and it didn't hurt less.|`|K542Db29aa	had no idea you could break it with exercise...|`|tDDkQU3Faa	what is a hymen..lol|`|oyINZiNDaa	nope lol still hurts alot.....|`|kc26mQCBaa	Besides what you mentioned, there is no way to avoid the pain. You also won't know if your hymen has been ruptured or torn without a pelvic exam. It may already be, and you don't know - either way its better to wait!
v6DRUwH7aa	McKenzie|`|bIaywrBCaa	McKenzie Shaye.....beautiful|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Blaire Harlowe. I love it. I also love the name Carys, though. Carys Harlowe would be just as cute.|`|wdXQaATDaa	Addison McKenzie is cute.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	McKenzie Shaye!|`|EXhVHMAlaa	Oh.  I like Addison.  Not sure about the middle name though.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Sorry but did you say girls name? The only girls name you have there is Carys.<br>  <br>  Addison, Blaire, Harlow, McKenzie & Shae are all masculine BOYS names. <br>  <br>  Addison - SON of Adam.<br>  McKenzie - MAC means SON of.<br>  <br>  Since when have girls been sons?|`|lqLzULXEaa	I would have yo og with Addison (its cute =]) but not Carys and as for the other names they are all ewwwe sorry =[|`|ValLVBcYaa	Addison Carys.<br>  <br>  Though I think Addison Shaye would be awesome!|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	mcKenzi Shaye but i wouldnt spell it McKenzie...alot like McDonalds.|`|9a2MdcuSaa	Addison|`|R1cey1Evaa	Addison Carys!!!|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Blaire Harlowe|`|9qFBftcpaa	McKenzie, but I like the others too.

VT24zOomaa	i didn't feel my baby until right around 19 weeks, and i didn't develop a belly until 23+ weeks, everyone is different. also you may not notice the first movements, they can feel like gas or like your nervous and have butterflies, i didn't realize that i was feeling my daughter move right away, i thought i had gas. then i realized it was my little angel, and my heart melted. you'll feel it soon!!<br>  <br>  congrats|`|0iUxfCMcaa	you are a first time mom, very normal to not be very big yet and it is also normal to have not felt the baby yet. with other mothers who are on their second and up they know what it feels like when the baby moves so they know what to look for thats why they feel it earlier. your tummy will start showing more in the next month or two :)|`|GlzVQclpaa	You probably already have felt your baby move but just dont really know what it is. Soon you will figure it out. It feels like a little twinge. Dont worry just give it a little more time. If you are really worried about any kind of complication call your doctor.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	give it a couple of weeks. i didn't feel my first child me 'til after 20 weeks.|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	I would not worry just yet. My obgyn told me I wouldnt be able to feel movements until 20 weeks. However, I did feel my baby start moving at 14 weeks ( I am very in tune with my body). I could only feel these movements if I held very still.<br>  <br>  I will tell you that I am just now starting to feel the baby all the time and well enough to where I do not have to be holding still. I am now 20 weeks. Do not worry, you should start feeling your baby in the next few weeks. <br>  <br>  Don't worry yourself! Everything should be okay. You should be having a level 2 ultrasound soon to verify everything! Good luck!|`|4yGGjs7zaa	first pregnancy the baby isnt usually felt until around 18-22 weeks second+ 16-20 weeks! <br>  so you still have plenty of time!<br>  <br>  your baby may not be very big so is why your bump isnt big! some women show more than others im sure its nothing to worry about! if you are worried about the size then talk to your midwife!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I'm really small too and I didn't feel my baby until two days before I reached twenty weeks! I was really small until 22 weeks! Everything is fine. If you are really worried then speak to your doctor but I'm sure you're fine!|`|drDpM6opaa	is this your first because im also 19 weeks with my second and i feel it move loads it never stops but with my first i didn't feel it uuntilabout 21 weeks and im small aas wellim sure every thing is ok|`|ZzjUHawhaa	ur baby is fine. u may not feel the baby move up until 6months which is also normal. you will gain weight slowly at first but you will have the most weight gain and baby movement in your last trimester|`|zATQaiwIaa	dont panic - if the doctor has said you are fine then just relax - im sure you have heard the heartbeat by now...<br>  <br>  some women dont really feel any movement until they are 22 weeks.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	don't worry i didn't really feel mine until mid-20's. and some babies aren't that active, my mom says i barely moved when she was preg. Your baby is probably fine : )|`|4l5aQnOyaa	I would say go see your doctor if you are that concerned.|`|rzf4tMXGaa	Have you heard the heartbeat? is this your fist pregnancy? If you answered yes to any of these you are fine! I'm 22 weeks and I just began to really feel the baby.  at 20 weeks I felt little little pokes, which i didn't even think was the baby..now I feel them a bit stronger and more often, but not on  a regular basis.  They say for first time moms you will begin to feel movements at about 22 weeks.  Don't worry!|`|65RZ441Zaa	every pregnancy is diffrent. I was about 5-6 mths when i felt my son move:) I gained little weight, and had hardly any symptoms, and he was 8lbs!!! My daughter was moving about the same 5-6mths, but i gains a tone of weight and had morning sickness and fatigue the whole time!!! I wouldn't worry, you'll see your baby movin around at the first ultrasound!|`|ibR8TkDiaa	YOU WON'T START FEELING THE BABY UNTIL YOU ARE AROUND SIX MONTHS AT LEAST I DID .AND CONGRATS ON THE PREGNANCY|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	You probably have felt your baby move already but just didn't recognize it.  Alot of first time mothers often mistaken the baby moving at first for gas or hunger issues, etc.  2nd and 3rd time mothers are able to tell when their baby moves sooner than that because they tend to recognize the difference having had the experience before.  Alot of times at first it just feels as if your tummy rumbled, like you were hungry, or like gas.  They are said to be your first flutters...because that's all they are ...flutters.  Almost like butterflies in your tummy.<br>  <br>  If your baby was doing fine at your last app which should have been about 3 wks ago then I am sure it is fine now.  You SHOULD...most do...have an ultra sound at around 20 wks and you will be able to clearly see the little baby moving, although you may not be feeling it a whole lot yet! On your next app even if you don't have an ultra sound let your concern be known by the dr.  She will reassure you everything is ok!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck..no worries!<br>  <br>  Oh, and with you being so small you probably aren't going to get as big as you may expect.   If your dr doesn't think or didn't think in the last app you were gaining enough weight, trust they will mention it because it is very important to eat right and gain the right amount of weight during pregnancy.  Be patient..You'll start growing faster in the weeks to come!  :o)|`|W1p6LetFaa	Don't worry about that yet.  My cousin is very petite and she did not really start showing until she was about 25 weeks.  Now she is HUGE at 38 weeks.  She has gained over 40 pounds and looks like she's about to fall over, haha.  You have plenty of time to get bigger.<br>  <br>  Also, I did not feel my baby move until I was 21 weeks pregnant, and even then I wasn't SURE I felt anything until I was 22 weeks pregnant.  My mother-in-law, however, NEVER felt any of her sons move and they were all perfectly healthy and happy babies.  It's different for every woman!  It's too early for you to be worried! <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Some women don't feel their babies until at least 21 weeks, so I'm sure you're fine. Your size doesn't really have too much to do with it.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!
uaDqpK4Yaa	I would probably wait until about 8 months.  You are going to have to cook it for a while to ensure it is soft enough for baby.  I hope she has teeth by then.<br>  I hope this helps,<br>  Carol<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com/asparagus_baby_food_recipes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com/asparagus_bab...</a>|`|MMj7YcXkaa	when both my sons were six month old, they had teeth and he ate soft veggies and soft fruits  never pureed them.  just steamed them.  cut them into bite sizes.  don't see why you wouldn't  just watch for allergic reactions.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Yes, it's perfect first food even for baby-led-weaning, my daughter loves it :)|`|ME62Mtv4aa	not unless it pureed|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Make sure it's mushy, so the baby don't choke and yeah.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	i remember my doc saying that most green and yellow veggies could be fed to a baby as long as it is pureed. so i would say go for it, (but check with your doctor to get his/her blessing.)|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Sure, I did.  I started by steaming his a little longer then ours.  I usually gave him more of the tips as well if the asparagus was woody or stalky.  Look for thin aspargus, they are more tender, some of the big thick asparagus have a tendacy to be woody and stringy and is hard for me to chew, muchless my son.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Im sure you can I don't see the problem if you are too worried then just call her doc and ask them.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I don't see a reason why not.  It's actually a great food for her to hold the stalk and chew on the top.  Obviously, watch her for choking, but you'd have to do that with any food.|`|SDjrojZXaa	it would be great for her but i would grind or puree it because sometimes in asparagus you run into those extra chewy or stringy peices that can be difficult for even an adult to chew up sometimes.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	yes! She will love it.  You don't have to puree babies food. Just let her pick it up and go to town.

It means "son of Adam".... please don't put that on a little girl. It's adorable for a boy, not a girl. Parker and Presley are also boy's name but don't bug me that much.<br>  <br>  Sorry for starting off with a mini rant.<br>  <br>  Anyway,<br>  <br>  Taryn Isabelah is adorable, although I prefer the spelling Isabella.

AA11327039	Do you think you can call in and ask for a nebulizer to be delivered and for the doctor to phone in a prescription for a steroid?  My son had croup and after the first whole day of treatments he was doing MUCH better.  <br>  <br>  If he does this for you, just remember the child will drastically hate the treatments for the first 2 or 3 days, but after that he will do so very much better.  The screaming and fighting are to be expected.  Just hold him down (recruit help if need be) and make sure the mask seals over his nose and mouth the whole treatment.  The crying actually helps deliver the medicine deeper into the lungs which helps with recovery.|`|gwK3ouVlaa	Hey my little girl had this. i would advise you to go to the doctor.

A cough is usually only present with some sort of bacterial infection in infants over 3 months. So if I were you I'd bring her in-better safe than sorry!<br>  <br>  BTW-My daughter was sick last week-Her temp was 103 and she was sluggish, fussy, and had a runny nose for days. I called her DR, and they said they didn't want to see her unless her fever lasted more than 3 days, got above 104, or she started to cough. The nurse I spoke with said bring her in right away if she develops any type of cough.

ZzjUHawhaa	the reason you had 2 cycles because of the irregularity of taking the pill. your body was used to taking everyday and once you stopped it changed everything. since u had sex 2 weeks after your last period u very well may be preggers. take a test and see:)|`|InZU5aaxaa	First if you do a dramatic change to your body, being off the pill, it can mess with your cycles for a few months. Next if it is a long month like January it is fine if you have two periods. I had mine every four weeks. If a month had five weeks I would have one at the beginning of the month and one at the end. As for when you ovulate it could be a few months to get back on track from coming off the pills.<br>  <br>  If you are TTC don't think about it and push for it. The more you do the more you stress which can cause your body to continue to be out of sync. Good luck.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Your body just needs time to adjust after stopping the pill.|`|z4FZlLxyaa	that happened to me when i stopped taking my birth control pill.<br>  i got 2 peorids in one month. i thought i was pregnant but  i wasnt.<br>  but everyone's different.

x8JRkRNkaa	18 months is really too early for a child to be potty trained. My son potty trained at around the same time my daughter did they were both a little over 2 1/2. They were both fully potty trained (night time too) by age 3. I bought them big kid underwear with their favorite character on it and explained to them they can wear them, but they can only wear them if they go in the potty. Of course they had accidents, but they were using the potty most of the time.|`|Cwqkbp49aa	One of the bigger questions is, are you ready?  You will need to be able to devote up to three months of daily encouragement to your chld.  There is  no set age to do it, but the recommendations is 18 mos (if the child is showing signs) to 24 mos.  <br>  <br>  Just like all of the other milestones, you can't rush it.  Signs that yoru child is ready include a desire to use the potty, the ability to undress himself, and the ability to follow simple instructions.  If there are a lot of stressors in the home, including a recent move or new baby, death, illness, or other crisis this will have a major impact on when your child is ready.  <br>  <br>  During the transition process, it is helpful for diaper changes to no longer be kissy-kissy, tickles to the feet, smiling times.  Insetad, they should be "robot like"...not angry, but not fun times.  Just routine and emotionless.  This helps the child learn that being on the potty gets them a lot more praise and attention.  You will need to decide what words to consistently use (to describe body parts, urine/bowel movements), pick a potty chair that is easy to get on and off of.  Make sure it's not too distracting.  Help yoru child recognize signes of needing to use the potty, and make trips to the potty routine.  Notice the signs (squatting, dancing, etc) and take your child to the potty.  Provide loads of encouragement and positive reinforcement.|`|GlzVQclpaa	My daughter is about 2/12 years old now she is really getting the hand of potty training now. I introduced her to the potty before she even turned 2. You can certainly introduce your son to the potty but don't hold him to high expectations. Physically he needs to be able to sense when he needs to go. Usually if they can take a nap and wake up dry they are ready. With that being said there is nothing wrong with buying a potty seat letting him sit on in, letting him come with you to the bathroom and explaining to him what your are doing. They key is dont force, push, or punish your child.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	My daughter started showing signs at 18 months as well.  She flat out told me after dinner one night "Mommy..I gotta potty!"  I was kind of shocked really and didn't believe her but put her on the potty for the heck of it and sure enough she went!  I didn't want to push her either...especially since her daycare doesn't do potty training until 2 years old.  So I talked our pediatrician and he told us to let her have fun with it and keep her interested by buying a potty seat for the big potty and let her do her thing.  He said you really can't potty train until you can get your pants down on your own anyway so it was okay to let her take her time with it.<br>  <br>  We bought the potty chair, some times she'd tell us she had to go...some times we'd ask her...she loved how excited we got and the praise from going.  When she turned 2, daycare was able to help and she trained faster than most of the older kids in her new class.  She's potty trained except for nights now.  I would do the same thing...get a potty seat and let him go at his own pace since he's showing signs so early on...definitely don't push it though, you don't want it to backfire. If he does go on the potty, make sure you make a big deal out of it every time so he gets just as excited about it as you do...this will help to keep his interest.  When he starts to go more frequently and is really getting the hang of it, you can start offering rewards like bubbles and stickers (my daughter is a sucker for bubbles LOL).  <br>  <br>  Remember it's not normally an overnight miracle and some days it can be frustrating.  They'll even have a week or so where they seem to regress just when you think progress is finally being made but remember, tons of toddlers go through it in the process.  Be consistent and positive!  Good luck!|`|0975d6fe7fd3fadbbfb484e05da8300aaa	I don't think age really matters. The child needs to be able to tell you with words that he has to use the bathroom, he should be able to pull his/her own pants up and down and be able to mostly wash his/her hands. <br>  <br>  Boys are usually potty train later then girls, but I wouldn't really worry about it until he's closer to 2 or 2 1/2 unless he's starts telling you when he's going to need to go. If he comes to you the second he's done and demands a diaper change you could start. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|rHoj4coQaa	In my opinion 18 months is way too soon, especially if his speech is not developed enough. My daughter is 22 months and still is not ready. She understands the concept of "pee" and "poo", but still hasn't gotten to that point where she comes up to me and says i went "pee". i think that is a very great sign of readiness when they can say that. The best time to start would be after 2. If the child has not yet able to tell you that he has to go, then he is definitely not ready. Starting too early can discourage a child and make it a more difficult process in the long run. Changing diapers isn't very fun, but its all about being a mom. I would wait.|`|idTdPSvCaa	until your child can tell you clearly that they need to go you should not be potty training.<br>  have you thought about wether he can pull up and down his own pants and trousers/ Can he reach the basin to wash his hands?<br>  my daughter was fully potty trained by her 2nd birthday,i tried to put her nappy on one day and she refused i put pants on her and that was her,i also went cold turkey with the nappies i didnt want to confuse her with pants and nappies for different times,also do not try pull up nappy pants as this confuses a child they cant tell the difference between these and a nappy,i suggest leaving the new pottty for your son to play with in bedroom then move it to bathroom.let it stay there and every night before a bath let him sit on it and see what he does if he does do something in it then give lots of praise and keep reapeting what he has done in it,"well done you did a wee wee,a wee wee what a big boy to do a wee wee"this way he will get to realise that the puddle in the potty is a wee wee and this is where it should go.good luck.|`|wcDStct2aa	My daughter is not old enough yet but i have been thinking about it and feel that when she is 18 months old i am going to start to introduce it putting her to sit on it when i go for a wee to let her know that it is ok and get used to a potty from seeing my friends try children find the potty quite daunting.|`|oU23CYEWaa	my oldest was potty trained by the time she was 12 months but it was her chose she did not like be wet at all but she done everything early but dont stop trying|`|G2auAv1Saa	I started when my daughter was 14 months old. She showed interest and I just went with it and it worked really well. She was fully potty trained by 16 months.<br>  <br>  edit: You guys would limit your childs ability just because you feel it is too young? If your child is showing interest you should run with it and be thankful. Children are so much smarter and can adjust easier than any of you give them credit for. <br>  If your child is seems to be ready, introduce it to him. If it doesn't work at first, don't be discouraged it will happen eventually. If it happens be excited! If it works at first or not, you have a wonderful child who won't be suppressed by a mother with a 'youre just a  baby and can't do anything' mentality.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	We trained my son at 21 months of age, but he probably would have trained sooner, as he was speaking in small sentences at 15 months.  But at that point I had a 3 month old (kids are 12 months 4 days apart), so it would have been hard.  But when we tried at 21 months, he was trained within 48 hours.  We just did the, throw him in underwear thing and don't leave the house for a few days.  We tried this same method with baby number 2, and our daughter potty trained that way again in 48 hours or so at 18 months.  So if he is ready, it is totally do-able.  But if he gets upset with it, just back off and try again in 2-3 weeks.  Good luck!

AA10556677	Hopefully you can broaden your niece's interests, since most of the stuff that's been mentioned is Disney crap. Bring some Harry Potter books that you can read to her. Rowling is a fabulous writer, and is appropiate for all ages and both boys and girls.<br>  <br>  PS, I started reading Harry Potter when I was about 9-10.|`|w6QF2uJHaa	try harry potter im reading them and im 9 <br>  hmmm <br>  how about clubpenguin or webkinz try reading maybe diary of a wimpy kid?|`|BRT2teSqaa	My 9 year old loves American Girl dolls.  She also loves to read.  The Disney channel is also huge- shows like Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place.  She also still LOVES Barbies, but enjoys  braiding and doing their hair more than anything now.<br>  <br>  She loves crafts- especially making beaded bracelets and necklaces.  Decorating  picture frames.  Also drawing and creating with crayons, markers and construction paper|`|4CMQuJgOaa	depends on the girl <br>  <br>  hannah montana, jonas brothers, camp rock, some still like baby dolls, dress up-nails, hair, some like make up (lip gloss, eyeshadow)|`|LnXeCC38aa	Sometimes there are really not faggotish and don't like Hannah Montanna and Jonas Brothers.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Pretty much anything Disney.|`|9c6e3f8169b79e67d959162cc83dc7b7aa	Hannah Montana is popular, and so are the Jonas Brothers.  Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez (basically the Disney Channel gang) are all pretty popular with tweens.  But, it all depends on the girl.  <br>  <br>  I know an 8 year old girl who loves Webkinz and Shining Stars (like Webkinz).  She's also getting into reading and playing school and stuff.  She's getting into the computer, like Barbie.com and Pollypocket.com sometimes.  And she is "crushing" on the boys in her class, and she keeps a little journal.  And she is kind of obsessed with what she calls "the beads".  I don't know the exact name, but it's like a plastic board with little pegs that you put beads on, then iron it and the beads are stuck together in your design.  Sorry I don't have the name, but it's a fun project if you find them.<br>  <br>  I would say any girl likes some good girl talk.  Like maybe you could talk about cute guys in her class or something.  Or talk to her about fashion and accessories and maybe even make-up.  Another good idea is arts and crafty type things.  You could make T-Shirts (AC Moore and other craft places have blank t-shirts with special markers and such) or buy a jewelry making kit.  Hemp jewelry is also popular, you know, weaving bracelets and stuff.  They even have kits where you can make purses and  such.  They're even fun for adults!<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!!

rwXcLTNvaa	Nobody can predict that.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	yeah, but you have to order them a couple of months beforehand|`|EsaFg8eaaa	You might, its all chance. With fertility treatments you probably will.|`|UuYVehSsaa	practically impossible to acctually predict that.<br>  but since there is a gentic instance of twins in your family (its in your genes) than yeah there is a definate possobility.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Its just chance. You aren't a twin so I doubt you are more likely than others. My grand mother was a twin, had twins and none of her 9 kids had twins.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	No one knows.

(Unless one of my cousins ends up having twins) But there is no definite answer for that|`|4yGGjs7zaa	it is possible yes, but since there are no direct family members of yours like your dad or mum or sibling etc then it does lessen your chances!<br>  it has been known for a women to have twins when they dont run on either side or the family!|`|O5LItEFRaa	Well, you obviously have a greater chance than most to have twins. But whether or not you will have them is a mystery and you can only find out when you concieve! Hope I helped!|`|d6e3edb7d5559a5fe7e5e38ad3c056c4aa	Maybe.

My mom had 2 sets of twins even though there were no twins anywhere on the family tree. My little sister who is one of the second set of twins had a twin pregnancy but one didn't develop. I am a twin and have had 4 pregnancies and they have all been single pregnancies. So no twins for me.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	no twins are rare<br>  <br>  Among general populations, the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 3 in 100, or about 3%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 60% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics, part of a 2004 study by the National Center for Health Statistics show that twins represented 32.21 of every 1,000 births.|`|yEABBdWiaa	yeah you might if they run in your family<br>  but you could easily not<br>  my mums a twin and she didn't have twins<br>  but it could happen any way. You don't know for sure until it happens.<br>  <br>  But if you get IVF treatment you have more of a chance of having multiple births. But this is usually for peopel who can't have kids.<br>  So no finding out until you get yourself pregnant. Or you could ask a doctor or specialist in your area?|`|iKAAYJ84aa	ohh hayy girllll. you better get that checked out... it seems to me that youre probably going to end up with 17 kids livin on the streets.. on manhatten.. if you ever need a friend you can call my ancient rodent who i call Peter Pettigrew.. he has helped me through many years of not planned pregnancies...!<br>  <br>  I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH,,<br>  maybe i am the father to your baby..... if thats possible... you never know ;)|`|XL14HwO8aa	Twins run on the mother's side of the family, meaning that if your mom were a twin, then you would have a greater chance of having twins yourself. Since it's your dad's side, you have the same chance as anyone else (3%).|`|Py3kFnDyaa	you could because it is in your genes! but no one can know for sure.. what about your partners side? that also plays a great role in what will happen when you get pregnant. looks, size,multiples!|`|vMSm9M4saa	You could, but its not like just because alot of people in your family are twins means that you are going to get twins, its just chance|`|ZLwbmUr9aa	Cant be predicted, but its in your gene's to possibly have twins :D|`|vhMgc72caa	its more likly when you have them inyour family so theres a good chance|`|doD7Z7Dfaa	its unknown|`|xF6aTbDVaa	get preggy and see!|`|h1WSpKA0aa	yeah of couse u will if u have two buety marks u will|`|Ig3W5YZnaa	depends how much semen ur hub dooos into u
sRy2SKpXaa	Wow. I definitely wouldn't be rushing out to get a bikini, trust me. I really honestly doubt that you'd lose ALL of the weight by then, but then again, it is different for every woman and pregnancy. I have a 3 year old son and when I was pregnant with him I gained 30 pounds and it took me 9 months to lose that (plus an additional 20). But with him I gained weight everywhere, I don't even know what size I was. Now i'm 31 weeks with another boy and have only gained weight in my belly and chest, so I can still fit in my pre-pregnancy jeans and all that. It's hard work to lose the weight, especially with having a newborn baby to take care of. I heard breastfeeding helps, but you really have to stick with it. Just eat right, and try to do some sort of exercise to try to help. Good luck|`|zATQaiwIaa	hahahahahaha...your already thinking bathing suit - just wait to see how you feel after you have your child.  You will lose weight differently and in different places than before - your whole body chemistry has changed.<br>  <br>  The amount you lose and the time frame you lose it in depends if your breastfeed (which can make the weight come off quicker), if you exercise and how healthy you eat.  Plus when you have the baby you will "lose" what ever the baby weighed plus about 5lbs for the amniotic sac and fluid.<br>  <br>  Congrats|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I'm 29 weeks and I've already gained 30lbs too! I'm thinking that all the weight is not going to come off on it's own and I plan on goin gon walks with my daughter and husband and eating right. I just can't seem to put the sugar down during this pregnancy! Good luck!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	It differs with every woman.  I would expect anywhere from 15-25lbs within the first week or two.  You'll probably walk out of the hospital 15+ pounds lighter.  It all depends on how much baby weighs, how much water retention you have, how much blood you lose etc...  With my first son I lost almost 30lbs by the time we left the hospital because I had a ton of water retention from having preeclampsia.  With my second son, well he is two and ahalf weeks old and I have yet to weigh myself but I know I've lost atleast 20-25lbs.  Breastfeeding helps lose the weight.  Eating right, walking when your ready.<br>  <br>  <br>  You probably will lose the weight by your 6 week post partum visit, or have a little left, but even if yo udo lose all the weight your body wont be the same.  You hips do spread and they don't go back.  Your belly will look weird, like a pancake for awhile and it'll be all squishy.   Remember your belly has been like this for quite some time so expect it to take time to go down.  Your body is doing an amazing thing, don't worry about your appearnce after.  Once you ahve that baby you probably will be too tired to go swimming anyway.  wait until your 6 week post partum visit and see how your weight loss is going and how your body is slowly but surely bouncing back and buy whatever bathing suit you feel comfortable in.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Depends<br>  on:<br>  Your body type, if you will be breastfeeding, elasticity of your skin, working out<br>  <br>  See a doctor, ask him.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Even if you lose all of it by then, you aren't going to look the same.  My suggestion...go with the one piece.

MMj7YcXkaa	we are active military, navy, to be exact and we never paid for either sons birth!  you have to look at your insurance and see what they cover.  do you still have military insurance or not?  if not and you are using medicaid, it cost my sis 3000 each child for a traditional hospital birth.  that means no c-section and no complications. she had an epidural and the baby stayed 2 days.|`|egN478Bbaa	It really depends on ur insurance.  I would find out from ur ob/gyn abot their costs w/ ur insurance.  Thats the best thing I can tell u.  I think mine cost like 1200 or so and that was just the ob stuff.  Good LUck!|`|tkSXjqhuaa	About $300, I would say for a natural birth with insurance.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	wow, after reading these answers i am so thankful i live in canada.  doesn't cost a thing for us to have babies here.  hoorah for universal health care!|`|bfBzkuRqaa	If you're taking about the co-pay on the hospital stay for the birth itself, it depends on your insurance. It can be anywhere from $50 up to $250 or more, or it could be a percentage of the total stay. A C-Section would likely cost more. You should call your insurance and ask them about how much your co-pays would be. Also, you need to think about pre-natal visits (most insurance has no co-pays on these, but there are some that do). <br>  <br>  But those costs are tiny compared with what a child will cost you over its life. Think...Diapers, daycare (or one parent staying home and not working), food, clothes, school supplies, medical insurance, etc.|`|AA11961672	It all depends on your insurance and what type of birth you end up having. I had an emergency c-section and our out of pocket expense was around 3K|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Wow. That is really low. I paid over $3,000 to have both of my kids - one through C-section, the other natural birth. And we have health insurance (Aetna).<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how military benefits work, but I imagine they pretty good?|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Do you have health insurance?  That's pretty much the determining factor.  With my health insurance it cost me $250 out of pocket to have a baby.

I've been lucky with my kids that they so far are not croupy (knock on wood), but I didn't outgrow my affliction with it until I was in high school. 90% of the time I would start coughing at night and within a day or two it was over without medication. The doctor told us that that kind of croup is not dangerous. However the other 10% of the time it lasted for a week or two and I was in danger of my throat closing.  When that happened I was hospitalized and given breathing treatments every few hours. If you think this is going on too long, don't be afraid to call your doctor back and tell them she is still having trouble. In the meantime stand with he in the shower and let the steam loosen up her cough. Also try a cold air vaporizer in her room at night. For best results "tent" her bed and get it to the point where it is dripping wet in there. It really does help :)|`|lGcpXteaaa	My mom holds my brother in the bathroom while its steaming from the hot water...then she bundles him up and takes into fresh air to clear his chest.<br>  <br>  That is supposed to help a lot. My brothers croupe usually lasts a couple of days to a week and he explains it as a 'frog in his throat'...lol its cute...<br>  I did pretty much the same for my daughter when she had bronchilitus, it helped a lot. Even if just for an hour or so.<br>  <br>  Hope she gets better x|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My 2 year old got it 3 weeks ago.  He was given a 3 day supply of a steroid.  The MD also said a cold mist humidifier would help.  Also, if it gets bad in the night to take him in the bathroom and run the shower and let him breath the steam.  He felt better in a couple of days.  I would call the MD and tell them what's going on and see if she needs a follow up.  Good luck!
d5a52bb19a9fa6747be1ee4084979a27aa	It's pathetic thing to complain about. Imagine how awful the poor women feels.<br>  Kids are accepting of things in life and anyway kids should learn that everyone is different.<br>  They should understand about disabilities.<br>  The people who are complaining are obviously worried about discussing the matter with their child.<br>  I am open and honest with my daughters they will then grow up to accept everyone.|`|AA11530601	if it scares them then the parents can turn the TV off...she has had a lot of messages from parents saying that their kids like her.....so its not all kids who are scared by any means. There is a lot of (potentially scary for kids) violence too on TV, yet the poor one armed presenter gets picked on? give me a break.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	my nephew loves her, hes only 15 month, but he always smiles and chats away while shes on TV, i dont see why she should be taken off, children will see people with disability's EVERYWHERE they go....|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i feel for the children that have parents who are so biased.  thats the real shame.  think of how those kids are being raised.|`|336a1f89fdd7352c0589d6b7f7ff2592aa	Dammed if you discriminate against disabled, and now dammed if you dont, you cant pretend to your kids that disabled people dont exist, how many times have you seen a Young kid stare at a disabled person because they have never seen them before, children need to know what is out there and if it gives them nightmares, which i cant imagine in this case well so be it, that's life, kids are gonna see many things in there early life that they are not going to like, best to just tackle them as they come along and not be so insular with them|`|YCXxP43Laa	I think its a shame that parents complain, instead of sitting down with their children and discussing it. Since when has the tv been a substitute for a parent? How on earth are we supposed to fight intolerance if people who are disabled are actually agreed to be people to fear!!!<br>  <br>  To Buddha, would you suggest that adults with strawberry birthmarks or who have been badly burnt like Simon Weston should not roam the streets during daylight hours for fear of upsetting sensitive children?|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I think it's the disgusting world we live in, in it's finest.<br>  <br>  I don't see a disability, I see a woman. No arm, who cares. That's the problem, people say disability or *special* and everyone starts feeling sorry for them.<br>  She obviously doesn't want their sympathy, and she certainly isn't getting mine. She is a woman, and a successful one - Why would I feel sorry for her??|`|Vzzc6mATaa	Its good and right that she has been given the job many people with disability are treated as 2nd class and not given a chance in the world of work company's often take no notice of disability rights's law I would love to have a job and erne a wage but do to disability no one will let me I have tried for 100's but company's do not care|`|Y0YvU0aZaa	"We should hide all these people away so that they will not give these poor defenceless children nightmares". <br>  <br>  This attitude is barbaric, uncivilised and selfish<br>  <br>  The attitude of these parents terrify and frighten me - they would ALWAYS be the first to complain but the thoughts and actions of their kids is their responsibility.. <br>  <br>  Their parenting skills are dangerous to the future of this country.<br>  <br>  I have found an ON/OFF button on my remote control and on my TV - have some not got any. Maybe these "perfect" parents have not leant to use it.|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	its desgusting its not the children that are scared its the parents my 4yr old brother watches her and hasnt even noticed and he usually notices everything. <br>  <br>  these parents are basically saying some disabilities are wrong they dont moan about sign language being used on the channel so being deaf is ok but having 1 full arm isnt its them with the problem not the kids|`|drDpM6opaa	its horrible my daughter is 2 and she doesn't even notice it if these children are complaining then i worried for them as they mite grow up been nasty to disabled people|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	It's a shame for the poor woman in question.|`|FQJoYIamaa	yeah.. i know its sad to hear but she was born like that...she didn't make herself like that so its a gods gift and shes different that's the main thing<br>  i also like the fact that she took these responses very positively and answered them in a very polite way.. adults should not be writing about this on behalf of there children as she hasn't done nothing wrong like murder someone or say she'll chop  your arm off to if you watch her...|`|532XA7lkaa	Of all the things to shield your kids from, and I do believe in she idling them from harmful elements...this is just ridiculous.  Shelter them from violent shows, curse words, drug use on television....not disabled people!|`|zyxJFuFAaa	pathetic. people should teach their children that not everybody is the same. we come in all shapes and sizes. And...as it happens have different personalities. <br>  :-)|`|AnRpmytLaa	Some people are so small minded. Its sad, I hope their children dont grow up the same.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	this is the perfect opportunity to explain to your child that everyone is made differently- we like to watch certain shows on tlc with our kids because they see everyone isnt exactly the same. if people are that up tight about their kids seeing people that arent "perfect" then change the channel! seriously-the lady is missing part of an arm-its not like she looks like something out of a horror movie!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Wow that is disgusting. Parents should be "embracing" the fact that although she only has one arm, she is just as normal as everyone else! Honestly, some people are morons. That poor woman!

b1mVjqfSaa	I admit it...I am a disneymusicaholic...LOL<br>  <br>  I have CD's of various disney music. I haven't listened to them in a while though. But you can bet that each time I watch a movie...I am having my own Disney Karaoke!<br>  <br>  Love Lion King, too!!!|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	I'm not a mom, but I'm a teenager and I still love Disney music. =]  I like You'll Be in My Heart too!  I like pretty much all the music from the Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Hercules, and Beauty and the Beast.  And I also like the Siamese Cat Song from Lady and the Tramp, it's always made me laugh! haha.  And my mom and I both still love all the Disney movies!|`|AA10730513	Me, Me!< MEEEE! ... I LOVE Disney Music!<br>  <br>  Well, some of it at least. ... I wish I could find a place to download the individual songs I like from cartoons without buying the whole CD and without those licensing limitations that places like walmart.com have put on me in the past. (grr ... I lost a LOT of songs because I had to reformat my hard drive and i couldn't get my license back from them)<br>  <br>  I like "You'll be in my heart" too, along with many other songs. I like "part of your world" from The Little Mermaid and "Part of Your World" from Aladin and ... lets stop before I make a super- long list. <br>  <br>  I'll have to listen to the version you found tonight. Thanks for sharing.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I LOVE music.  All kinds of music. And that includes disney music.  I like the music from The lion king, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The little Mermaid the best.  My kids like the music too, so it works.<br>  <br>  By the way, I have a Brayden too.....But he's a Braeden :)<br>  Hope that made sense!|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I like it when the movies are on. I don't have a cd or anything with the songs on it. They are good songs.|`|l7tijAohaa	I prefer listening to my own music, but when I'm driving with my kids, I really don't mind listening to Radio Disney and all of the Disney soundtracks.|`|9QdtQczYaa	my mum does n she's cool!!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I'm such a sucker for Disney! :)<br>  <br>  And Dylan just started getting into the Lion King and how embarassing that I know the movie BY HEART.

jipqICzVaa	My son was great at weeing in his potty but the first time he did a poo, he was so disgusted at what was so close to his body that he refused to go again. He'd wait for me to put a nappy on for him to go to bed and would poo immediately. I bought a toilet trainer seat for him and a little step to help him get onto the toilet. I showed him how the poo went straight down the bend and out into the pipes. Once he understood this he was fine.|`|HP1pToMOaa	He is still very young. My Grandson did it all when he was 2 1/2. Plenty of time yet, they are all different.|`|65RZ441Zaa	My son was scared of his poop lol and my daughter is too! I read in a parenting magazine that it can be scary for a toddler to see something coming out of their body. My daughter will be 2 march 7th, and will pee in the potty, but for the poopy, she runs behind the bathroom door and does it quietly. Kids will just come around.|`|pgBHEesTaa	Well children are all unique, please try telling him often to tell you when he wants to poo and that no mater what you are doing you will attend to him, children need re assurance and must be told if not they do not know.  Pls try this
nFj30sZcaa	Completely normal. For my first trimester, I had swollen breasts that were very tender and hurt a lot. At about 14 weeks or so, it was like it had never happened and they were back to normal.<br>  Don't worry yourself, be thankful!|`|zBz10IiOaa	yes very normal hun every women is different but it is normal|`|H0sJU68Oaa	I'm no expert but people get different symptoms at different points in pregnancy. Kind of like how some people get sick and it goes away but for some people it doesn't. You might notice that it comes back off and on. I have that with tenderness in my breasts.|`|egN478Bbaa	Yes, symptoms come and go!  :)  kinda like morning sickness, it's there one day and gone the next.  Just relax and enjoy it.  It's an adventure!|`|FH2iKFcJaa	Mine arent as sensitive as they were a couple of weeks ago. *13 weeks*|`|TsnXXfI3aa	totally normal for all of your symptoms to come and go!
MtC3CWZraa	I was due last Thursday. I’ve been dilated to 2cm for two weeks, was 70% effaced as of last week. My fluid levels and NST were also fine.  I went through a stage of just being completely desperate to get this kid out, but I decided to let it go. There’s nothing I can do to speed this along and flipping out about it won’t get it done any faster. <br>  <br>  What’s to fear about an induction? Sure it might hurt more, but it wasn't like labor would otherwise be a joyride. For me, it puts a foreseeable light at the end of the tunnel. I know I won’t have to be pregnant longer than Friday and in the meantime, I could go into labor naturally. Either way I win because I’m going to end up with a baby at the end.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	If this helps any-  I have an adopted son that was due to be born Dec 25th (20 years ago)-  the doc told his birth mom that on Dec 12th that it looked like she may be late, and if he was not born by Jan 1st they would possibly induce.  Our son was actually born on the 13th, the day after the doc told her that she most likely would have to be induced after that 25th.  You could be late, or labor could come very quickly like it did for our son's birth mother.  Good luck, and I pray that everything is fine, when you have the ultrasound on Weds.|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	Cajun food.... I'm serious.  Something about the cayenne pepper makes you go into labor!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Eat pineapple, walk, or have sex, or all 3. Good luck!|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	My son was 4 days "overdue".  I was in the same situation as you, I thought he was never going to drop, I was never going to dialate and my son was going to be in my belly forever!  My doctor scheduled to induce me on a Monday and my son decided to make his grand entrance Sunday.  Hopefully this baby isn't as stubborn.  What made me go into labor was walking, walking and more walking. I tried a few other "self inducing" ideas and nothing worked. I would suggest you walk.  They will make you walk a lot in the hospital too if labor is going slow. Good luck and hopefully you don't have to wait to much longer!|`|R7lAURjWaa	Well I'm 5 months pregnant with my first, so I obviously cant share personal experience, but from what my doctors and my family's doctors have said is that your due date is just the estimate and of course you know that, and the baby can come a 2 weeks earlier or 2 weeks later than that. :)|`|5DfSfyWfaa	lol I love answering this question. Sex if you can! I was in the same position but you are better off than I was (I had no dialation or anything). After a few days of walking and spicy food we finally did it (who wants to at this point?) and I lost my mucus plug the next day. 2 days after that my amniotic fluid started to leak. So, I believe it really did get things going. Good luck!|`|ruczpWrGaa	hate to sound crude but have sex, she will show up.  kids and their timing.  actually its the stimulation anyways,  have sex.|`|52U22fiAaa	I was 1 cm dilated at 39 weeks, then my OB stripped my membranes and I went into labor that night!  Maybe you should ask them to try that?  It worked for me (though it was very painful IMO).|`|Wpmkdwvtaa	walk walk walk walk and walk some more just keep walking till you start labor, and then walk some more!!!|`|AA11961672	spicy food and sex if you can stand it.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	haha:P<br>  I had a similar feeling with my first baby.<br>  I did not want to be induced theretofore i ordered a HOT AND SPICY pizza,which I adore utterly.<br>  And there he was,9 hours and a few mins. later Elliot Lukas was born !!<br>  Sex helps a lot,thats what I've heard...<br>  But it's not actually proven to work 100%,nothing is ..really.<br>  try spicy stuff,I love it so there was no issue.<br>  Hmm,how about a warm shower and a nice massage to gently make her come out. Nope,kidding that will make her want to stay in..:P<br>  just take care of urself,and good luck..<br>  p.s the birth hurts,but its so amazing to see ur little baby open it's eyes,AMAZING experience..|`|tjob70U5aa	Hi I am having baby number three and the best thing to do is walk a lot. And have sex, the sperm helps soften the cervix. And don't stress out that wont help her come any sooner. They wont let you go to far over due. And if they induce you, well that's not that bad...they just might make you stay in bed...unless they don't give it to you in an I.V. drip. Then if they put it right on the cervix, you will be able to walk around the floor they have you on. Good luck....and just relax, i know it's hard. Just lots of walking. She will come soon enough...enjoy it while it last...lol|`|jZLSSjaYaa	lol. chill naturl will do what it needs to do|`|ZMnD5s7laa	I've read that either going walks or having sex at this tiem can help induce the labor. I'm pregnant myself which is why I took on this question. It's perfectly okay if your late- I've had family members to be late as well as early and its all okay. All babies are different just like all adults all different. The baby just may not be ready. Now- if in two weeks you still have nothing, not eflt any contractions or diluted yet then you can worry but usually by that time the doctor can tell you something of what will happen. You'll more than likely give birth in a matter of days and just stressing. Your baby is proabably just taking her time. Be grateful tho- at least you made it to your due date, there's plenty of other women who would trade with you becasue of having premies or early labor.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sex, walking, nipple stimulation are all some things you can do. But they won't work if the baby isn't ready. you could theoretically go another two weeks!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be thinking induction just yet, though. As long as the placenta, baby and you are healthy, I would just wait until it's ready to come on its own. A lot can happen in a short amount of time - believe me. I wasn't dilated or anything and then a week later gave birth (I was at 39w). And at least they're not talking induction just yet - it's good that they're monitoring you first instead of jumping into something serious right away.|`|AA11327039	Go to a spa and really really relax.  Take naps and enjoy this time while you have it.  Trust me when I say a 'late' baby is much better than an early/on time baby.  I know you want to hold this little angel in your arms but she's doing just fine growing inside of you.  <br>  <br>  With my first I was 11 days early, with my second I was 11 days late.  I wish I could have put my second one back in for more 22 days (be 11 days late)
wiAVa1H5aa	Yes one boob will get bigger (the favored breast), it's very common - usually the left breast is the favorite and for some women it has the higher fat content too.  No it won't be a permanent uneveniness, just as long as either you are nursing or he is preferring one side to the other.<br>  <br>  Correct his behavior?   Well, sometimes using a different position for nursing helps, like laying down with him, football hold, etc...   For us my right side has a more forceful let down then the left so that made my youngest a little mad, plus he had to work harder for it - which made him madder, but I just always started him on that side, eventually he stopped favoring one side then the other.   For some moms it's a forceful let down and you can pump first, get a nipple shield, or express a little first.|`|hY5mMi90aa	No your breast will not become uneven; but the milk from the one breast will decrease and when u r nursing; you need to swap out so both breast have equal milk.  The baby has just got in the habit, to like sleeping or nursing on that side.  Just like when we choose a favorite side to sleep. <br>  The breast he/she nurses on may have more milk to satisfy the needs faster, do to fact u r letting baby nurse from there it is better to nurse(5-10) min then switch.  Even newborns get spoiled.  Start to nurse from the side that is not the favorite and switch to the favorite to finish or start at fav & switch & go back to fav.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	My son does the same thing!  I try to offer him the one he doesn't like as much first and then give him the other one.  Plus, I pump when I am at work, so that helps even things out a little!<br>  I don't think you have to worry about them becoming uneven.  I'm sure when you are no longer breastfeeding they will even out!|`|c416U2swaa	Just keep offering him the side he doesn't favor as often as you can, it'll work out! Breast is best!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	im slightly loop sided because of this but only i notice<br>  you will be told you have to keep trying both but my baby just wouldnt feed for long enough<br>  we use to fight each other till we were both crying!!
6PhSENcXaa	I agree with you, but I've noticed on here that the most of the people here are young teens.  So lack of knowledge is a big issue plus the fact that people don't read.  <br>  <br>  I got thumbs down on and answer that was true and I had the facts to prove it.  It was something that is in the legal books and all. But I got thumbs down.  People don't check the facts before they put thumbs down.  Their just looking for the points.|`|AA11988490	You also need to remember that there are trolls who go through & give people thumbs down for no reason! Its not always the other answerer's (is that a word?? :)<br>  I try to read the question thoroughly before answering, and sometimes after I post my answer the asker has added more details.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	Yes, I do like Nacho Cheese Doritos !!  Wait, was that your question? (just joking)<br>  <br>  I know what you mean.  I believe that often times people give the "thumbs down" just because you beat 'em to the punch.  I hate to think that, but that is my conclusion...I've seen it many times, just as you have.<br>  <br>  Also, people only hit the high places when reading (both answers and questions).  If one does not get to the point quick enough, the thumbs down button is clicked.|`|lGcpXteaaa	That really annoys me when they clearly don't read your question..or answer for that matter.<br>  I think the biggest problem is that a lot of women on here are so far up their own *** and think they know it all so will jump to the chance to prove somebody wrong. Even when its an opinion...Some people are just way too pushy!!|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Some people are illiterate. They can't understand what they are reading and can't understand some of the bigger words. They have no idea what word structure is and therefore can't understand your answer. I am sorry we stopped teaching people how to read and add in America. They can only understand gibberish. And by that I mean the new text message with their phones language.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	sometimes its an accident. I have mistakenly given an up or down when i didn't mean to. And some people on here just don't know what they are talking about. Don't sweat it.|`|lKjiWZaUaa	some do some don't, actually im sure most do read them but about 25% just look to make off topic comment's..|`|tkSXjqhuaa	People on here dont REALLY care what other people think, unless their asking the question.|`|08a714d3e35f7a5fcf99d16c6a42a486aa	That is the bad thing about the internet, even idiots have access to it. People should have to get an I.Q. test before being allowed to sign up for service. Remember you can be uneducated and still have a high I.Q. so people who want to better themselves would still get access. Just no more jerks who think they already know everything.|`|AXccNMMZaa	yeah =/<br>  sometimes they dont show you all the answers that have already been posted before yours.<br>  i also get angry when people copy/paste the same answer someone already said >:[|`|nTQghH34aa	people are stupid and just do it for the points like wtf its not a race people|`|AA11210211	It's not always the answers who give TD's there are a lot of trolls and teenagers in this section that like to play and sometimes it is people who don't like you,but yes I see your frustration,just ignore it that is what I do and you get use to it after awhile.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	The thumbs down that I hate are when it's on a question that's asking for an opinion. How can an opinion be wrong? I'd only ever give a thumbs down if an answer is blatently wrong.<br>  <br>  I think people just come in and thumbs down for no reason sometimes. It annoys me too!|`|1s3nddaYaa	yea i know what you mean. people are to closed minded if people don't think exactly as they do.sometimes i miss read something but i read the whole thing lol and then i answer all weird, then re read the question and have to go back and change some of what i said haha.but i read all questions and answer that i come upon.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Yeah, it really annoys me when someone only reads the title of the question but none of the details and it is really obvious in their answer. The details are there for a reason!|`|AA11327039	Yeah, some people are thumbs down happy.  I guess they are just grumpy by nature and just want to give everyone a thumbs down.  Sort of a 'misery loves company' sort of thing.<br>  <br>  I would have to agree with you about 13 weeks being too young for teething but that anything is possible.  I think that people reach out for teething answers when they have a crabby baby. People have a hard time accepting that some babies cry just because.  Mine sure did.  People tried saying they were teething (at 2 and 3 months old) but I was like, nope, they are just grumpy today.  They didn't cut their first teeth until around 7 months old and at 10 months old.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	It is frustrating.  A lot of my answers receive thumbs downs and I try my best to give correct information, or my opinion if that is what is asked, but some people I think believe that my information is incorrect even when I post links to sources that support my answer, and sometimes people just don't agree with my opinion.  You can never please everyone!!  I don't think that the people who give similar answers to the questions as you do are the ones giving thumbs downs.   I think it is other people, and unfortunately there are people who only give thumbs downs to everyone without reading or even caring about the answer given.  The best thing to do is ignore it and move on.  Life continues.      I've had answers that got tons of thumbs downs and still ended up as the best answer.
7rCeCVl2aa	1-2 pounds a week is a great target goal. When you lose weight to quick you are more likely to gain it back.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Just take it easy, eat healthy and exercise regularly. Don't go on any diets, except for a healthy balanced one of course, and relax the weight will come off and what doesn't come off by the time you have finished breast feeding will come off with more strict diet and a stronger exercise regimen.<br>  <br>  My sister went from 5'9 and 140 pounds to 210 pounds. After the 6 months she had been breast feeding she weighed 155 pounds. So I guess you could put it this way: During her 9 months she gained 70 pounds. During her 6 months of Breast feeding and balancing her diet she lost 55 pounds. Her daughter is now One year old and My sister weighs 135 (which is 5 pounds less than before she got pregnant)
OPloDbxvaa	my 6 month old eats cereal in the morning and as a snack before bed <br>  lunch veggies/meat and fruits and dinner , and drinks a bottle of formula about an hour before each feed and sometimes a botlle of juice between lunch and dinner so that 28oz of formula <br>  <br>  and he's a big healthy boy <br>  <br>  22lbs 29inches<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and congrats|`|Y7b8yI1Caa	I feed my 6 month old baby solids 1-2 times a day. She gets rice cereal and a side of veggies in the morning and then at lunch she gets the veggies again but no rice cereal.  I also give 2 oz of juice mixed with 2 oz of water every other day.  I offer milk if she wants it after each meal.|`|8ql1Hvaaaa	My daughter is 6 months, she get 2-3 feeds a day.  I also give her some of her milk after her feed, if she wants some with it.  I would give her some of her milk during her feed instead of juice.|`|ojf5bN8taa	When my son was 6 months old I feed him one meal ( of solids ) a day. At lunch time so that I had all day to monitor him for allergies.
MW18liqTaa	You should really try to nurse your newborn. If you don't want to have the same bonding experience that you have had with Emily, try and pump your milk and give it to him in a bottle.|`|AA11210211	It took me about 3 weeks to fully dry up,I wrapped an ace bandage around my boobs really really tight and it worked,Also don't touch them which is hard to do when you are engorged because rubbing them takes away the pain,so don't touch them  and try taking a hot shower for the pain.There really isn't anything you can do take make it hurry up just leave them alone and don't stimulate them.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It is truly best to continue nursing.  Don't try to dry up if you are still blessed with milk.  Babies who are nursed longer get sick less, if at all, have fewer problems with sickness and all sorts of other things in later life and have less diaper rash.  I have noticed a dramatic difference with my first son and my others.  The first had to be on formula due to my medical reasons, and since then he has had a number of medical issues and has been sick more than anyone else.  My other children who were breast fed never had those problems and have all bee the picture of health.  Don't give up, it's so worth it.|`|jlUczlQZaa	Lactation is there biologically for a reason, to feed the baby as nature intended for the health of the mother and baby.  You can't rush nature and shouldn't try.|`|AA11784984	Evey woman is different. It only took me about a week to dry up with all three of my kids. Now i'm not saying that the milk was completely gone but my breasts were much smaller and I no longer leaked and no more pain from drying up.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Cabbage leaves help with engorgement, just put them in your bra (weird I know but it works) and sage tea is meant to help decrease milk production. Worth a try.|`|AA11071252	Since you are so early anyway, your milk may not come in as strongly as if you were full term.  The best way to discourage it is avoid stimulation by wearing a snug bra, such as an athletic bra, 24/7.  Avoid hot showers and letting the water hit your breasts.  Avoid any activities that cause a lot of movement in your upper torso.  Watch for signs of infection, such as red streaking, hot spots, or flu like symptoms.  The cabbage leaves are a suggestion.  I would also strongly suggest that you consult your doctor or a lactation consultant while at the hospital visiting your baby.  They are much more qualified to personally assist you than anyone here.  I suspect that since your husband is a physician at the hospital that your are resistant to asking anyone there for help...maybe?  You must realize that your privacy is guaranteed by law...and if you don't want anyone else to know things, all you have to do is tell your caregivers, at least in the States.    Good luck Amy.
ygbhsZ2Zaa	I haven't had anyone remind me she's gone (perhaps they knew I'd slap them?) and I think I've been lucky in many ways- my family pretty much has figured out that everytime the seasons change, the winter comes, her birthday comes (and a week later the anniversary of her diagnosis with cancer), I'm going to be a little...off. Well, externally it's a little (to none, if you didn't know) but internally it's way off...<br>  <br>  What I have had, is people who say things like "it's so wonderful you got over it" and  "I don't know how you got over it". That one gets me everytime. Just because I wake up every day, just because I kept living, just because we had two more children (in fact the births of my children after her death have been especially bittersweet for me, because of thinking how much she would have loved them), does not in any way means I am "over" anything. There is no getting over, we didn't break up- I watched the suffering and miserable death of my firstborn child. I stood on a hill on a December day and watched the biggest love I'd ever known lowered into the ground in a child-sized coffin. What am I to get over? I laugh and I smile and I certainly love but I do not kid myself, part of me is very, very broken and can never be whole- what I HAVE done is made peace with that broken place- it is broken for a good reason, it is broken because I had the most wonderful little girl in the world, and then lost her. So, I can't think of any other way to say it, but that I am at peace with the gaping hole inside of my self, and at peace because a)- she was worth it and b) I have so many other blessings, and life was never meant to be perfect. And I learned pretty quickly, if I start asking myself "why" it will consume me.<br>  <br>  People say stupid things. Some of them are outright cold, but most of them, I think, are unintentional. Nobody knows what to say to a parent who has lived every parent's nightmare, and instead of saying nothing, sometimes they say something stupid. I forgive them. Most of them- except for the lady who once said to me "I know how you feel, I had to put my dog to sleep three weeks ago, and she was like a baby to me".<br>  Now I understand loving one's pet. But you didn't give birth to it, you didn't dream of it's gradutation, marriage, children, future, life...it was a dog. THAT ONE, I didn't let go.<br>  But mostly, I have learned patience, and tried to remember what *I* might have said, had I never been on this side of the experience.|`|0HICV1Tmaa	Aww hun.I did have a daughter that was born at 27 weeks,well they were twins.But my daughter was the one that didn't make it.She only made it for 2 days,so i have no clue what you're going through.I'm so sorry.|`|AA11506593	I have not. But I am very sorry for your loss. I cannot imagine what it is to lose a child.|`|52U22fiAaa	My best friend lost a baby at 3 months old due to a Staph infection.  It was extremely devastating for her.  It's been almost a year since his death and still to this day she cries about it and misses her baby like crazy.  A lot of family members ask her why she's so protective of her other baby (they were twins), or why is she dwelling on the past, but it's hard not to.  She's protective of the other baby because of fear of losing her, too.  And, she "dwells" on the past because she can not and WILL NOT forget her son.  Losing a child is something no parent should ever have to go through.  It's not the way we imagine life to be, our children are supposed to outlive us.  So, missing your daughter is perfectly OK and you need to mourn to be healthy.  Never forget her memory.  Leave her pictures up, and tell her sibling(s) all about her so they know how special she was and still is to you.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	I didn't lose a child, I couldn't even imagine the pain your going through, but I did lose my younger sister last june, she was only 13. It's really hard to deal with.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I am so sorry for your loss, I have a 4 year old (sitting on my lap) and I can't imagine how I would react if she were gone. I have two neighbors who both lost a child, one in pregnancy and one a few hours after he was born, so that's not exactly the same, they didn't have time to get to know their little ones the way you did. They both kind of clamed up at home and never came out for a while, then got pregnant right away. Again, Im so so sorry for your loss, congrats and best of luck to you and your new baby.
v0aKxF6iaa	for me the pump was less painful.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My sister and I were just talking about this!  She is currently breast feeding her twins. One of them is not strong enough to suck so she pumps and uses a bottle with her.  She told me that if you can make it through the first 2 or 3 weeks then you are good to go!  You just have to let your nipples get used to it.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I'm going to be honest with you... if you can get your baby to eat from the breast do it!  I have been solely pumping since my baby was 3 days old because he had health issues and needed a bottle... but when you pump it's like double duty.  You have to pump, then feed the baby.  Which for the first few days it's not a problem... but when the baby wakes up a 3am and all you want to do is sleep... you have to get up, pump, get the bottle, feed the baby... it takes twice as long!  Even if you have some milk already pumped, you still need to pump ever 2-3 hours to keep your supply up.  To answer your question: pumping does not hurt me.  It's not painful at all.  Just time consuming.  I plan on solely breastfeeding until he starts on solids, then from there we'll see.  <br>  <br>  Some breast milk is better than none, that's what people have told me, so it's up to you as to how long you want to do it.|`|GYrnb7Xcaa	Hi, I breastfed for a year and used a breast pump as well. The best thing to do is to get a really good breast pump which will make it easier for you. I used a Phillips Avent ISIS manual pump and found it really good and easy to use. It was about ￡22 - ￡25.  I didn't find it painful at all. Also breast feeding isn't always painful depending on if the baby latches on right and if you don't get any soreness in your breasts. Whatever you decide, breast or bottle, your baby will have a great start because you are trying your best and that's all any baby could wish for. Good luck with whatever you do!|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I nursed exclusively but pumped here and there to keep a "just in case stock" since I didnt want my daughter to have any formula.  It didnt hurt me one bit, just a little more pressure than if my daughter was actually nursing.  And I wouldnt limit the time you plan on nursing or pumping to just 2 months, yes that's a great start but you should continue on! You may find that you enjoy it.  Good luck.|`|98WKYtfwaa	My friend is breastfeeding, she said that when her baby lached onto her breast it was more uncomfortable than anything so she tried using a pump and found it much easier. She said it's best to use a nipple cream too because your nipples can become sore.<br>  <br>  For the user who said it's double the duty, well it's not really because you can store breast milk in the freezer for 3-5 days and you can also freeze it, so when you've got spare time you can pump as much as possible then store it for the night feeds. <br>  <br>  I have a leaflet about breastfeeding and it says that you shouldn't go without pumping for a couple of days because your boobs can become engorged with milk and be sore. <br>  <br>  So if you plan on storing some milk in the fridge, it's probably best to pump each day just so your breasts don't get achy. <br>  <br>  It's upto you how long you breastfeed for, if it suits me to breastfeed i'll probably do it for about 6months and then start weaning, if it's not very suitable then i'll do it for 6weeks. I also heard that breastfeeding for 6weeks gives them the best start because it hardens up their immunity more. Even if you hate it and do it for 2days that's still good according to my midwife.|`|xwOwsZvEaa	i only breast fed 4 3 weeks so i hope it done some good for my 2.<br>  as 4 breast pump, they r fine as long as you latch it on properly u will no if u havent it will hurt like bugery trust me i thought it was just me till i started bleeding. sorry!!<br>  it can b very enjoyable cause once u have expressed u can let some else feed and still no they r getting the goodness of your milk.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	I only ever tried with a manual pump and i found it quite painful and difficult to express milk. but the electric pumps look quite good although I did not bother because they were a bit out of my price range. I could not express much with the manual so if you do try this try with an electrical one|`|AA11637393	no its not painful unless you let your breasts become engorged with milk.  I pump a good bit but nurse also.  You can rent a breast pump but if you decide to pump for months then your best bet is to buy a Medela pump.|`|532XA7lkaa	No, the opposite.  I found pumping much more relaxing and easy, not painful at all.  I found nursing itself uncomfortable and sometimes painful, if I had the wrong latch.|`|KPhmCcmgaa	I found pumping breast milk not that painful. It can be sore but not for long.

b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Sometimes you really do have to wonder where people leave their brains at. You really did do the right thing in speaking up, awesome! I seriously doubt i this mother learned a lesson here but I can guarantee you one thing she would have screamed bloody murder if someone had taken her daughter and then she would have been the most ideal mother in the world. Sometimes you wonder if some of these people actually care what could happen orjust maybe this baby would have been better off with another family. I also wonder how mother nature goes about picking parents in todays world because some of them are truly unfit to be a mother. Thank you for your action. If a few more people would act or even speak the world would definitely be a better place.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I have no glue because I prefer taping someone's shoulder.  Glue is messy.|`|iHJuXKBiaa	I keep all my babby Spams close with Gorilla glue!|`|K3Iv86h1aa	I always hate when I'm out of glue.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	What you did was awesome and I would have probably done the same thing myself. As a mother of 3 I could never imagine not having them right by me, if I move they move. I keep them no more then an arm reach away. Parents like that is what gets kids taken in this day and age. At least your were responsible enough for her and took charge of the situation. If it wasn't for you that baby could have been taken. You go girl.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	this is a case of stupidity.  pure and simple.  i had a similar situation only i was at the mall and the stroller w/the baby was outside of an eatery right in front of an entrance.  i handled the stroller for a good 10 mins before the mother came forward and she was ticked at me.  i told her flat out she could take it up w/mall security as they were on their way.  the kicker - she was at a table w/like 3 adults and maybe 5 kids.  what was one more kid at the table?  morons.  idiots.|`|snUDfcfgaa	Good thing that one customer taped her shoulder.  Since she had no glue, she had no way to stick to her babby.  With the tape, the problem is solved!|`|JK2RvliYaa	At least it wasn't a hot car. You should taken the babby then sold it.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Maybe people with enough tape on their shoulders don't need any glue.|`|ElBIeRFNaa	some ppl are sooo stupid!  i would NEVER leave my daughter like that!  you never know what kind of whackjobs could just walk off with your kid!<br>  Unreal!  my daughter is nearly 3 yrs old and i STILL need her either IN the cart or holding my hand.  i don't trust anyone.  i was a kid when Adam Walsh was stolen from that florida mall.  that keeps playing in my mind.  if it's too much of a bother to keep your child near you, then you should never have HAD a child.<br>  jmo!|`|XOtOMncwaa	I hate it when people do that. When I'm out with my son alone he is glued to my hip end of story... we were eating in a restaurant yesterday and I needed to throw our stuff away, the trash can was maybe 5 feet from out table, and I still took my son out of the high chair and carried him with my to throw our food away. <br>  My fiance and I were in a restaurant one time, and a family came in, they had like 3 kids and a baby in a carrier. They ordered the buffet, took their baby over to the table they were sitting at, and they all went to the buffet, completely on the other side of the restaurant, and I know they couldn't see their baby. I sat there and watched it until they came back, because the place was packed, anyone could grab it and run out the door. Some people just dont think.
7l4tR0aZaa	i wish i could do that|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You need to talk to him about it.  If his weight is not normal than average 15 year old, then you need to take to the doctors.  It could be developing eating disorder.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	You may want to talk to him about it. Male teenagers are prone to eating disorders too.<br>  <br>  At 16 I lost 20-30 pounds in just under two months, and that was due to surgery that had me off solid foods for a while.<br>  <br>  It is probably worth it to talk to him first before calling a doctor. The more info the doctor gets if you have to go that route, the easier it will be.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Well, you might want to ask him about it first, then if he has anything else wrong, take him to the doctors.<br>  It is not that RAPID of weight loss, but if no exercising or dieting has taken place, Im not sure how healthy that is.|`|dSd5reJdaa	It could just be something as simple as growth.. Usually when boys hit that age that start getting a lot taller and not gaining any weight. However, that is a lot of weight to lose.. so a visit to the doctors wouldn't hurt...<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you out..|`|QupnWmpyaa	LIP ST

Its a speech defect thing. I say my R's funny, and I kinda sound nasally.

wWdMcbvGaa	Next time you send them a gift and they dont respond call them and act worried that they didnt get it.

T1xWH9yLaa	This is something you and your husband need to talk about. Yes anyone can have a baby, but not every one can be a mother. like in your case. I would ask you husband, since this woman is not contributing anything anyways. That he ask his ex not to come around for a while, but that she can call your self or  your husband to see how the child is doing. if argueing occures let her know I am not going to argue with you and say when you calm down you can call back and politly hang up. After a while she will relize that she is not in controll of when she can come around or not, it is your home. For the childs sake it is not healthy, As you all being the better parents you need to protect him, seek  counsouling for him and get him involved with things to keep his mind of of the negative things that his mother is doing towards him. Show him and tell him how much you all love him no matter what she does. Maybe then and just maybe then will she figure out what she needs to do.  If she doesn't that is ok too, but don't allow him to have to deal with it every few mths.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Do you actually think that saying anything to her, in any way at all, is going to make a difference in her behavior?  <br>  <br>  I doubt it. <br>  <br>  The better thing for you to do, as someone who loves her stepson, is to help him learn how to accept her at face value, but keep his own self-esteem intact throughout and to behave in a way that brings out the best in their relationship with each other.  In fact, learning to accept her, even love her, warts and all, but still be a strong, confident person, is something he can really be proud of in his life.  <br>  <br>  Confronting her will make *you* feel good.  Will make you feel righteous.  Will gain you some fun drama in your life.  But, it won't help your stepson at all.  It will only bring more drama, anger & sadness into his life.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Say nothing! Her actions speak volumes…<br>  <br>  It will do you NO GOOD to tell her all those things. I personally agree with you, but again, it’s like talking to the wall. <br>  <br>  All you can do is support your husband. All you can do is support your stepson. Be there, be a friend, be his shoulder to lean on. Let you guys be a family and just shower him with love. <br>  <br>  She’s the one missing out. You’re the one with the bonus family! <br>  <br>  I would looooove to tell of my stepdaughter's mother. For so many things. But what does that resolve? Absolutely nothing....so I'll save my breath! What goes around, comes around....her time will come. In the meantime, I'm going to love her little girl like no tomorrow. Because that's what mothers do. <br>  <br>  As a mother to my own child and as a stepmom, I don't even comprehend why some parents do as they do.|`|KdR1Lx3yaa	JUST DO IT SAY WATS ON UR MIND ..ITS CALLED TOUGH LOVE|`|0SIhrYCbaa	I am really glad your son has you and not just the crazy bio mom. Its so sad what kids get put through these days.<br>  I understand the need to shake this woman and to try and make her see she's hurting her child but....it won't help. She knows all the bad things she does and hopefully somewhere in her tiny mind hates herself for it.<br>  It is your place as the true mother here but she won't listen to you or any one else I'd guess.<br>  Just try to be there for him when he finally does want to talk. He will love you for it.|`|DvnOIx1laa	Well, I understand what you are going through, only I am the mother, and I have the similar situation with my sons father. Unfortunately, you cannot make her a better mother, the only thing you can do is get the courts involved and have her completely removed from his life! It sucks that his mother is that careless, but he does have you , so he is blesssed!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Don't bother wasting your breath. If she's not going to be a proper mom, nothing you say will convince her otherwise. Just keep doing what you're doing and support your stepson when his feelings are hurt. One day all of you will learn not to let her actions hurt any of you, because you'll simply stop caring. Just let that day come on its own.|`|EzcQOTPtaa	Confronting her isn't the answer. You need to focus on your stepson and perhaps get him counseling to deal with his feelings. Other than that, you and your husband need to show him love and consistency.|`|6BE9f4ZKaa	well first off shame on her. thats aweful. no shes not the mother, you are. the older your stepson gets, the more he will see that. you CAN talk to her, be CALM though. i really dont know if it would do anything. but for your sons sake, try. if she over reacts and freaks out, say i tried, and hang up. chances are shes not going to change. shes no mother by any means. if your son wants something to do with her then go ahead and try. maybe he soon wont, and will just accept that she is inmature. but that wont be anytime soon im sure. please dont put any bad thoughts of her in his head(although im sure your not). so i guess..give it a try, but dont expect a change. good luck to your family and give your son the love that he needs.
TGUoZF63aa	For Isabelah, the H is a little much. I do like Isabela however.<br>  <br>  Taryn Isabela is adorable! It's not extremely feminine though, it depends on what you like.<br>  <br>  Addison Parker is a bit too masculine for my taste. I like the spelling Adyson and Addyson, too! How about Addison Renae, Addison Isabela, or Addison Harper? <br>  <br>  Isabelah Honor is cute! Like I said before, I think the H is too much and I prefer Isabela or Isabella... Honor is a unique middle name with some meaning too...I like it!<br>  <br>  Taryn Presley is okay... when I think of Presley I automatically think of Elvis and it sounds too masculine to me... Taryn is a beautiful name, however! How about Taryn Isabel, Taryn Claire, Taryn Faye or Taryn Alyse? <br>  <br>  Isabelah Harper is absolutely stunning! Isabella is a common name, but Harper gives it more of the unique edge... it's beautiful!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|AA11871081	Addison Parker or Isabella, keep the spelling traditional.

The dentist checked my teeth and then just checked his. It was a getting-used-to-kind-of-visit. He was no more than a year old when they sat him in the chair and let him ride up and down. And the dentist looked at his teeth and gave him a toothbrush, which was really funny since he took it to bed with him, but never used it in his mouth. In a year we went back and continue that to this day. Every year, starting by one year old. We did the same with our next child. Four kids in the family, and they all love their dentist and look forward to seeing him and the staff.
AA11109728	I know how that is!  Sometimes I eat not so well, and I know I've gotta improve when I get sick of it and start craving fruit!  As for my 4 yr. old, she doesn't eat a certain number of things from each food group, but I do vary her meals.  Meaning, she may not get 5 servings of fruits and veggies a day, but she does at least get some of each every day.  Same for everything else.  They aren't always hungry enough to include as many servings as they should have, but I think as long as they get a little bit of everything everyday, things will be good.  As long as that's routine, I don't see a problem with getting take out here and there, or having cereal for dinner on rare occasion.  I've also noticed that servings are usually smaller than what I think they are, so many times my daughter will actually be getting more in her diet than what I realize, like with fruits and veggies.|`|PMuAITczaa	My children pretty much always have a Home Cooked meal with a couple of different vegetables. But on saturdays we usually have a take away or something fun :]|`|rImbIx8zaa	My kid is really picky so her diet differs from day to day. Today all she wanted was pop cycles and chicken tenders shes two. if I tried to argue she would just go hungry so why bother.|`|oP504BtFaa	My daughters are pretty self sufficient because they're teenagers, but I make sure they have breakfast every morning - oatmeal or cereal, I usually pack lunches and that varies day to day but generally I pack a 'main course' (leftovers, sandwhiches, soup, salad) with a fruit, granola bar or something similar, and something sweet with a bottle of water. After school for a snack sometimes we have hummus and pita bread if they're home, but if they have activities probably an apple or banana and granola bar. <br>  <br>  Dinners vary. Dessert happens every night, though. Sometimes it's healthy (fruit salad) sometimes not so much (I'll bake cookies).
SkOALXv9aa	Although it hurts to hear our children say such thing it is rare that they truly know how much it hurts the parent.  You must understand that a four year old that is torn between a mother and father who are no longer together is sometime a victim of the hostility that one parent may have for the other.  Just from what you said it would appear that your X is trying to win the little guy over with his kindness toward him and using the youngster to help deliver his messages of dislike toward you.  This nonsense will eventually blow up in his face.  He may think he is winning his son over by using him in this way but as time goes on the son will loose his trust in the father for his continued contempt toward you his mother.<br>  <br>  I do however disagree with not spanking a youngster when the need is warranted.  It sounds like you do use good judgment in correcting him however do not rule out a little swat on the tail if needed.<br>  <br>  It does not appear that you are in anyway trying to turn the child away from his father but it also sounds like the father is allowing his bitterness to override his better judgment when dealing with your son.  It further does not appear that he is very interested in your trying to explain the problem to him in the manner in which you have thus far tried.  It may be that you will have to change your tactics in order to get around his anger.  Just keep trying and without escalating the hostality that he may still have for you.<br>  <br>  Above all do not concern yourself with the comments that your little son may make after a visiting weekend with his father.<br>  <br>  On the other hand it may be a good idea to get a little book and document the changes in your son and his actions following a weekend with his dad.  Use your little book and record the date and time that the youngster left with his dad and the date and time that he returned.  Pay close attention to the different attitude changes from the time he spends at home with you and how he acts shortly after returning hime.|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	When i was younger i used to tell my parents that i wished they were dead.

I am sending you a big e-hug 'cos you need one! It is so hard when you don't have the support that you need from the 2nd biggest influence in his little life!<br>  Unfortunately, you have to be seen as the 'hard' one for the majority of the time you are bringing him up, but the chances are you will make him into a wonderful young man you can be proud of and not a spoilt brat who just has to open his mouth to get what he wants. One day when he is older and wiser he will be able to see what it is you have sacrificed for him and he will throw his arms around you and tell you how thankful he is and how much he loves you. So hang in there now and when he says he doesn't love you, just smile quietly to yourself and wait for the day he's gonna come back to you and love you so much you'll burst!!!!!!!!! xxxxxxxxxx|`|AA11707965	Anytime a child goes to see the parent that doesn't have full custody it's like a party.

IS when two people work together towards the same goal weather they are together or not!   Put your foot down obviously your Baby's Dad is bitter...  But you need to make sure that your son understands that living with his dad is not an option.  DO you talk to your Babys Dad's Mother at all!  If you do I would talk to her and tell her the situation she will understand because obviously she has raised a lil boy.  She can talk to him <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope things start looking up for you!
HqOkC2YHaa	I was reading this....and your story has sounded like mine almost to the tee....except he plays world of warcraft online<br>  <br>  I'm starting to think that dads are also able to get post partum depression!<br>  <br>  Trust me though things will change a little when the baby becomes less dependent on you. My daughter just turned 6 months old and can sit by herself and play quietly by herself and since this has happened my bf has interacted with us more (like actually sitting in the same room as us) he plays with her now...but he still won't touch a diaper (he hasn't changed her since she was 2 weeks old)<br>  <br>  I too felt the same way and would cry every night wondering what I ever did to deserve a life like this and to bring a beautiful daughter into the world for what to have a dead beat dad who doesn't care about her and who he treats the mother like a POS<br>  <br>  I guess when they start to be more independent and act more human is when they wake up and smell the coffee!<br>  <br>  Hope your story goes the same way and gets better!|`|RF2YV9ataa	Ok you need to "man" up and tell him he needs to pick up some slack around the house.  So what if he works 8 hours a day and is tired when he gets home?  You are too?  THe way i see it, he is getting an 8 hour BREAK to come home to work.  Nothing is going to change until you tell him it needs to.  Just be upfront " Look, this is not working, i know you're tired when you get home and all but your not helping me around the house and the baby is really breaking me down and i need you to do more."  and that should be enough, if he cares, which im sure he does, then he will pick up some slack.  It doesnt sound like your with a loser lol just a guy that needs a little push in the right direction  good luck :-)|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i am in the SAME boat! my daughter is 18 months and it hasn't gotten better. i am also happy to say i am due in may with my second but sad to say i don't think even with baby #2 that hubby will change. this is just how most men are. they only see value in going out to work but they don't see what a value it is to have things done at home. my mother once told me how my father did the same thing to her when my brother and i were babies... she what she did was NOTHING. she didn't clean, do laundry .. none of it and when my dad asked why she told him i want you to see what it's like when you don't have someone to do everything for you. if you don't like it this way maybe you will decide to help out more..... <br>  it didn't really work for her but then again my parents are divorced so... anyway point is guys are guys and they won't change. my husband hasn't yet and i don't see it coming in the future.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	From my experience, and talking with friends, this is very common!  Once my son got to an age where he was more fun, my husband got MUCH more involved, at least where helping with the baby is concerned.  His excuse for everything was "You're breastfeeding, so you have to get up with him anyway."  I found that giving him a choice helped-- "Do you want to unload the dishwasher or give the baby a bath?"  That way he made the decision, and would usually do it while I was doing the other thing.  <br>  They think that when we are home with the baby, we're not doing anything!  They have no idea how much work we are doing.  One day my husband came home, and the house wasn't clean, no laundry done, nothing for dinner, and he said "What have you been doing all day?"  I almost blew a gasket!  I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF OUR NEWBORN BABY!!!!!<br>  I still do most of the work around the house, but he helps out a ton with the baby, and does all the outside stuff and "guy" jobs.  Now that I am back at work, he gets him ready to go to the sitters, and he understands how much work it is!<br>  You may just try to explain to him that you are exhausted and need some help.  He honestly may not understand how much work taking care of a baby is.<br>  Congratulations!|`|hVVALFAPaa	Hey, he is a man. He will walk around a completely full trash can without seeing it.<br>  <br>  My guess is that he was like this before the baby too, so this should be nothing new to you. Now there is just more for you to deal with because of the baby.<br>  <br>  You can try to gently tell him that the baby really makes so much more work and that you have to hand some of the chores over to him. Then list the chores. Make sure they are chores that will directly affect him -- like washing his own shirts, washing dishes.<br>  <br>  After several days (weeks?) of you not doing HIS chores, hopefully, he will step up to the plate.<br>  <br>  Note: on the bath and changing stuff: My hubby bathed and changed our first three children-- all sons -- all of the time. He was mainly responsible for their baths until they could bathe on their own. When our 4th child, a girl was born, he NEVER gave our daughter a bath and changed her only when absolutely necessary. He just did not feel comfortable around her naked 'girlness.' I don't know if this is how your hubby feels but it could explain things.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Hun I'm going through that right now too! It's hard and it really sucks! You need to talk to him about it. You might just have to stop doing his stuff. Tell him that if he wants clean laundry then wash his own. Just do your laundry and babies laundry and cleaning up your stuff. Let him leave his crap everywhere. My boyfriend just left his clothes laying in the bathroom. He wouldn't pick them up no matter what I said. I hated picking pu all his nasty clothes off the floor EVERYDAY so I just left them there. We got a puppy, and she peed on them a few times. (really gross I know, but it got him to start putting them in the laundry! haha) Let him run out of clothes to wear. Dont do the dishes for a few day. He'll need a cup or plate sometime wont he?! Tell him that that is how you feel. A woman can only manage so much. He needs to help you. My boyfriend ended up wearing the same jeans for 3 weeks before he finally caved in! He finally stopped playing stupid Warcraft on the computer for hours at a time and FINALLY helps me out sometimes! Of course I still have to ask him to do things, he won't just do them if he sees that something needs to be done, but its starting to get better!  (it leaves your house trashed for a little while, but in the end its worth it!)|`|AA12240972	You should prob have a talk about things you want him to do around the house.  But then also, maybe you should pick your battles.  Your home full time right now and he's working 8 hours a day yet your wanting him to bathe the baby and your counting the # of diapers he's changed.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you really need a reality check.|`|EhGR05Etaa	Usually I am totally against the whole.."well he's a man", however I think that there is a sense of men not knowing how hard it is because with mothers it comes a lot more naturally, especially at first.  Plus baby and Mommy have more of an instant connection and I think that leaves Daddy felling left out a bit.  Anyway my husband will get into times where he doesn't do anything.  So I will ask him to do something and he is usually very good...he will get up when we are both sitting just to make it easier for me.  But if I ask him to do something about it....and later it's still not done...I will just say "Are you waiting for the trash to take itself out?"  with a smile.  I really don't want to be the nagging type either....but I don't want to do it all myself.  I think you should talk to him...but maybe make sure you don't make it sound like you're mad at him...more like you NEED help because it's too much to do all alone!  OR......take a day off and leave him with baby even for like half a day...that way he maybe understands how hard and tiring it is to take care of baby AND do housework! Good Luck!|`|TZzWGFNMaa	I know how you feel, but it seems to me he's trying (a little at least, more than mine) He could still be trying to get use to how things will be from now on... Have you tried talking to him about it? maybe he needs your support through this too, being a mom is really hard at times especially when the guy doesn't pull their share of the responsibilities, if can get frustrating but don't let it get you down and don't let him make excuses for why he doesn't do the things he is asked to do...my boyfriends favorite is he goes to work and he's tired (like being a stay at home mom isn't Hard work)
BW7Nrqjzaa	Sounds like a strawberry hemangioma. I would have your pediatrician check it out if it's growing that fast. But most likely it's nothing to worry about. The wikipedia site has a good picture of one on a newborn.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Don't let the term "tumor" scare you. They are almost always benign and they very rarely remove them unless they are on the face or genitals.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Sounds like a hemangioma - they can be harmless, but if it is growing that rapidly, you need to have the doctor look at it.<br>  <br>  They ususally go away on their own in time.

That is a bit worrying.|`|6VR19YQWaa	Your child should have been seen by the doctor at 2 months and you should have brought in up then.  I have a feeling as an experienced mother that it is probably not cancer or anything. The doctor will explain to you what it is and let you know if it needs treatment. It can probably wait until the next time your child is sick or his 4 month check up to be seen by a doctor. But, the doctor DOES need to see it.|`|1e85af996a00b6352dde4d33312b5229aa	It could be a strawberry spot. Newborns get allsorts of rashes and spots (baby acne) which goes on its own. If you are concerned about it, get a doctor to check it out.|`|eaO0MRaBaa	I would go to the doctors. These things can be serious.<br>  That doesnt sound like a mole to me.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It sounds like a strawberry hemangioma. They can be red and flat or raised and bumpy. Some go away by age five - my daughter had one on her head that completely disappeared by age one. Sometimes they can grow on the inside as well, so you might want to have the peds look at it - they might just tell you to monitor it and get it looked at if it gets larger. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_1107.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_1107.html</a>|`|qayCggxMaa	It sounds like it might be a strawberry hemangioma.  They are fairly common birthmarks (which can actually appear some time after birth), and frequently go away on their own as the child gets older.  You should have the doctor evaluate it though, because sometimes they can keep growing and become a problem.
oWAUb6vpaa	It's best to stay away from caffeine. <br>  However, if you do have some, the limit is 2 cups in a day (and I would suggest not drinking it on a daily basis if you plan to have that much.) <br>  What you should do to help minimize the amount of caffeine for baby is to drink a glass of water right after drinking the coffee or soda. This is important to do soon after you have the drink. <br>  Keep in mind that coffee and soda cause more water to leave your body which can easily leave you dehydrated, and you & baby need plenty of fluids, so be sure you're drinking your 8 glasses (8oz. each) of water a day (or in combination of real fruit juices or milk - you only need 2 servings of milk per day which includes cheese, etc. - too much calcium is not healthy for baby either.) <br>   <br>  Take care..|`|bbQq205Gaa	I was told a cup a day is okay.

AA11085356	If you are 'leaking' water, then you need to go see your doctor as soon as you can. Not everyone breaks their water completely, sometimes it just ruptures a little, causing a slow leak. And if you are having regular lightheartedness, sit down. Have someone else drive you to the doctor. You are very close to full term, you could deliver any time really. Don't hesitate to talk to your doctor about problems like this. If I were you, I would really call someone and have them drive you to the hospital right away.|`|7NtOXhR5aa	Seriously.

AA11085356	It is a good idea to use both. However, no matter how many forms of birth control you use, there will always be a chance of you getting pregnant.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Yes you're reducing that slim possiblity to 0% and its always a good idea to use condoms to protect you from STD's.|`|qitXGd0qaa	O.k. I know its a bad answer, but the only way to eliminate ANY chance of getting pregnant is abstinence. Condoms and the Pill will greatly reduce the chance, but there's still a little bit of a chance. Some times God, fate, luck or whatever you prefer to call it, steps in and no amount of protection prevents a pregnancy.|`|acafdcce761f87a23b935269eb5f71f2aa	Yes.

zATQaiwIaa	STop giving him the juice!  He will drink the milk when he get thirsty enough - try strawberry milk.  You are going to have to listen to him cry so be prepared|`|AA11210211	He doesn't have to drink milk but if he doesn't you need to incorporate those vitamins with other foods here is a list of calcium rich foods that are non dairy:<br>  <br>  Salmon <br>  Tofu <br>  Rhubarb <br>  Sardines <br>  Collard greens <br>  Spinach <br>  Turnip greens <br>  Okra <br>  White beans <br>  Baked beans <br>  Broccoli <br>  Peas <br>  Brussel sprouts <br>  Sesame seeds <br>  Bok choy <br>  Almonds|`|thoMmZAvaa	If he's not started drinking from a normal glass maybe try putting it in one for meal times to encourage him to drink. Otherwise, just serve him water or watered down juices and obtain his calcium elsewhere. Use yogurt and cheese for snacks and try to get him to eat leafy green vegetables (such as spinach or some type of greens-collard/mustard/kale). These are all excellent sources of calcium, you can also give him a vitamin or supplement (though talk to your pedia about this first) if you don't think that you can meet his needs using other items.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	some people feel that milk isn't even appropriate for children to drink.  ie -  human milk is for human babies, and cows milk is for cows babies... therefor... when we're not babies anymore.. we don't need milk.  personally, i would just make sure he gets a healthy diet otherwise.  he can get plenty of calcium and D from cheese, yogurt, etc.   If you really feel a need for him to drink  milk, you could try rice milk, or kefir milk.. but I'd stay away from soy.<br>  There's no nutritional need for milk, just need for the nutrients that milk happens to supply - it doesn't matter where he gets them in the end.  Honestly?  chocolate milk, strawberry milk.... the loads and loads of sugar are doing him more harm than not having any milk, in my opinion.  my kids get 1 glass of milk per day.. and the rest is water, and sips of my plain green tea.  they don't even get juice.  they get real fruits and veggies - where the juice (should have) come from in the first place.|`|irnpklXpaa	does he like strawberry because if he does try strawberry nesquick when i was little it worked now i love chocolate milk (im 13 lol), but they also have vanilla and i think they have banana or something of that sort. good luck and hope this helps :-D|`|AA12314337	Work dairy into his diet in other ways. As long as he gets his daily requirements in, it's not that important that he drinks milk. Yogurt and cheese are good dairy-full child favorites.|`|FXKAGVZGaa	I'm a big believer in letting kids that age decide what they like and what they don't.  Their bodies seem to have an uncanny way of preventing stomach aches, allergy attacks, etc by developing a distaste for certain foods. <br>  <br>  By the way, kids do not *need* milk.  Kids with allergies/lactose intolerance have never touched a drop and grow up nice and healthy.|`|vplAsNscaa	I have a 2.5 year old.  I think every kid is different.  He loves the milk he gets for breakfast and for his afternoon snack. The milk he gets though always has a melted biscuit of some kind in it. He wont drink regular milk either. Since the first time he got milk (not my milk) I've put a plasmon biscuit inside the bottle. But I've also put other biscuits in..  even bio biscuits if you want. <br>  Hope that helps!|`|kuHE3z2Maa	At age 2, kids should be getting the majority of their nutrition from food, not milk. It's common for toddlers to not like milk. If you're worried about his calcium intake, try feeding him yogurt and cheese. My 2 year old son loves to feed himself a cup of yogurt or chunks of cheese.|`|2nKe3j84aa	Perhaps he just doesn't like it! What's the issue as long as he's drinking something? He can get his calcium through other means such as cheese and yoghurt.|`|2XZxA88Haa	have you tried silk?  You could try smoothies then they are getting something with nutrients and not something loaded with sugar (well depending on how you make the smoothie)|`|nFsg9KEVaa	my neice didnt like drinking milk so she gave her mushed up rusk's with it. works a treat.
uFrqC4Y2aa	I remember a lot of people giving my sister a hard time because her son only slept on his stomach. I recently read that you will reduce your child's risk for SIDS significantly by putting a fan in their room. It circulates the air and the sound helps them to go to sleep. Good luck!|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, if she is over 1 (sounds like she is close enough) she can sleep any way she wants.  Baby sleeping on their back is to prevent SIDS deaths.   SIDS deaths aren't an issue after 12 months of age.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	My son hated sleeping on his back.  From 3 months till now (he's 14 months) he's always slept on his belly.  As long as baby can lift head from side to side, roll over, etc baby should be fine.  She's okay, she's already almost 1, can sit up on her own I definately say just let her sleep how she wants to.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My kids both started sleeping on their tummy's at 3 months old; when they started rolling over by themselves.  It is only a danger for them to sleep this way if they can not roll over.  So this is totally fine!  Chances are, she has rolled on to her tummy whilst asleep before anyways.  She is strong enough now to turn her head if she ends up face down.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	She'll be fine.  When my children were born, there was no advice given on how they should sleep and they both slept on their tummies from a few weeks old, when they could raise their heads a little.  They are now 36 and 32 respectively.|`|b0yNkuUjaa	She is big enough to sleep on her tummy she has no risk of S.I.D.S|`|Aug6gZeTaa	She should be fine.  I have a 20 month old who started doing the same thing around 1.  By the time they are almost 1, they have pretty much developed of their muscles for sitting up and rolling over, so she can turn back around in her sleep  The only thing I would suggest is to make sure there aren't any blankets or pillows blocking her face or that would get wrapped around her head if she rolled over.  As long as she's sleeping with her face to the side and not buried, she'll be fine.  Once they start sleeping with their butts in the air, you pretty much never have to worry.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	There is no way to keep them on their backs once they start rolling. My son is nearly 7 months and once he started rolling he would sleep on his tummy every once and awhile. The risk of SIDS reduces a lot once they can roll and even more after the first birthday. I don't think you have anything to worry about, as long as there is nothing in the crib that she could get stuck in or something.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	My son slept on his stomach from 2 weeks old. He is now a healthy 3 year old. They have changed which sleeping position is safe a lot during the last 5 years. I think if the child is comfortable then there is no reason to move them back to their back.|`|q1b7170caa	You cant stop her turning over.  Years ago we were told not to put them on their backs incase they were sick in their sleep.  My 2 looked much more comfortable on their tummies and slept far better than my grandaughter did on her back.|`|024de3981da140ccebccab4a7f88e6b8aa	we dont have that problem as we find by putting her in a sleeping bag prevents her from turning over. speak to your health visitor for re-assurance but i think its pillows that are dangerous at that age|`|TunJmklmaa	i wouldn't recomend it until shes 6 months|`|YGSZgJuVaa	Its only dangerous when they are really young and cant roll over themselves. She will be fine now.
FfxmE9Toaa	It would taste better too. You don't always need just the properties of something; tomatos are very good for us and we eat them up.<br>  <br>  Again, make sure it is 100 percent maple syrup. What's in the capsules is anybody's guess since the Hatch Act of 1995 removed supplements from FDA oversight. You could be getting powdered milk with dye in it or something really yucky I won't describe.|`|SDjrojZXaa	im not sure that that would work i would try drinking lots of water and mother of milk tea first.|`|r782jijgaa	Don't know, but you should pump more or nurse more and it will help you start producing more milk.  The milk production works off of what is being used so if you are not nursing here and there then it will slow down production.  So the best way to start producing is start using more milk.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Ohhh yucky!  I guess if it is really in maple syrup then you could but I suppose that the level of the ingredient finugreek may be low and you would have to drink a lot of it. Also make sure its pure maple syrup so you don't waste your time on corn syrup.|`|eJsR7BZvaa	I don't know much about finugreek but I would think that if you drink maple syrup it would have to be the best-quality organic maple syrup you can find. I suggest taking a visit to a health food store like Whole Foods.|`|3tuwWidiaa	No.  They are not the same.|`|AA11961672	Nope, not the same.<br>  also you can try blessed thistle or mother's milk tea, both help increase your supply<br>  a natural and free way is to feed your child as much as you can, the more they nurse the more your body will produce, if you have a pump you should also try to pump after feedings to help increase it as well. <br>  <br>  right about now your baby should be entering into a growth spurt so they will want to nurse more, which is good.
RjdrO7DVaa	swimming, walking/jogging on the treadmill ... just avoid heavy lifting and anything that will strain your back|`|ArrpKUT4aa	pregnant on a treadmill?  you're insane!<br>  <br>  NO IMPACT SPORTS when you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  Swimming is great!  I did that and a lot of pre-natal and regular yoga.  <br>  <br>  I know you want to get active, you're in the second trimester when your energy goes way back up.  But be gentile to you and the baby, your ligaments are loose and everything is stretching out.  You feel more limber because your joints are more separated but you can also definitely split the placenta from the uterus or hurt yourself if you aren't careful.<br>  <br>  congrats!  having a baby rocks, and my son does sports with me now!  how cool is that!|`|2z3lTB2Raa	It sounds good as long as you ease in to it and, make sure you don't over do it try to limit yourself to things that are not as straining. Swimming is great for you and walking on the treadmill is good too. Exercise is great for your pregnant body. It also can help you have any easier labor and delivery. Good luck|`|6BE9f4ZKaa	swimimng for sure!!!! swimming is like the best ever during pregnancy. make sure you get alot of air though. also if you on the tread mill, do a fast walk. dont jog or run. avoid anything that works your abdomin.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	i wouldnt do much more than that if you havent been doing any exercise regularly pregnant yet, it could be harmful to the baby for your heart rate to be elevated suddenly for the first time.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Swimming is a great workout while pregnant!  However, my Dr. advised against running, so the treadmill isn't a good idea, unless you're just using it to walk.  Before starting any workout regimen, you should consult your Dr. as she knows you, your pregnancy, and circumstances better than anyone.|`|em8A42Bqaa	Prior to pregnancy I would go an hour a day, but pregnancy has made me lazy.  My husband bought me an excercise bike, but I have used it three times.  The gym manager said that light walking on the treadmill is fine she has a bunch of kids and she worked out daily.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	I am actually 7 weeks and just started to exercise when I was about 3 or 4 weeks pregnant.  I use a stationary bike at home. I broke my exercise routine in to segments 15 mins at 10 am and 2 pm it works great. I get my total of 30 mins. <br>  Anyways both are very good. Swimming I hear is low impact so that would be great and relaxing and so is treadmilling if you do a nice walk pace. I also hear that variety is good so maybe you could do both. Have them at different times. As long as you don't try to do the Olympic marathon you will be just fine. Good Luck :o)|`|zATQaiwIaa	maybe some swimming - but thats it - especially if your body is out of practice.<br>  <br>  The rule of thumb is you are usually ok to do anything you had been doing previously to being pregnant.  So if you stopped going to the gym in october your body is not exactly ok with everything.  I would take it easy and talk with your doctor|`|3qI1oyFaaa	If you were active before you're probably okay, but I would check with your doc on what is a safe activity level. He'll probably suggest long walks, at least to start with, while your body eases back into exercise. <br>  <br>  Check with your doc to be safe, congrats, and good luck!!|`|ZzjUHawhaa	NOOOOOOO!!!!!! DONT DO IT!!!! u should get exercise yes but not at the gym. you could harm ur baby by doing extraneous things. only thing u should do is walk, that is good for you and the baby.  u can go swimming but not like a dolphin ok. this is time for special care and relaxation. chill girlfriend u  can workout after the baby is born.
wTNsIqe2aa	I also miscarried at home & bled for a week. 6 weeks after miscarriage was when my next period started. If you have a faint positive I would place my bet that you are preggers!!! Yes, you can get preg right after miscarriage (my doctor told us this). I didn't believe that either at the time. I doubt that the hcG would still be in your system enough to test positive on a preg test 6 weeks later. Frankly, I doubt it would be in your system at all that long after a m/c. Mine was very low right after the miscarriage. If you take another preg test in 2 or 3 days the faint positive should be stronger if you are preg! =) Good luck at the doctor!|`|8oKazGVGaa	even if it comes out faintly but is positive it means could mean a yes that same thing happened with mine and i didn't believe it so much i called the company the test is 99% and they said i was as good as pregnant i still went to the doctors coz i still didn't trust it so go toyour doctor asap and a blood test will tell|`|O3EtP4vOaa	They say that after 6 wks your hcg levels should be back to normal, so it is possible that you are preggers.  Please be careful of evap lines though they can be miss leading as a false positive.  This website has a break down on evap lines.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you get your clear BFP!|`|Xh5rWuGhaa	Its def a possibility!! I had a m/c in Nov (my levels only reached 98) but after the mc they started going down really slowly. I had to have the metho shot so that they came back down to 0 (or else it could have taken a really long time to go down naturally). And after the shot they did within a week. How high were your levels when you miscarried? If they weren't that high then 6 weeks later a positive pregnancy test couild deff be a new pregnancy. Fingers crossed for you!!! When are you due for AF again? Your symptoms sound like pregnancy!!|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	you should go see your doctor.. but it sound like you may be pregnant again. if so i wish you a better pregnancy for you guys..|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	You could most definitely be pregnant again! A lot of women get pregnant right after a miscarriage without having one normal cycle. It's not a bad thing, the only probably is trying to predict when you actually got pregnant. <br>  <br>  If you got a faint positive you are more than likely pregnant again. It's rare to get a positive 6 weeks after. Normally by now the hormones have left your system. <br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!
O3EtP4vOaa	You could have missed your peak and began your period,or you could have missed your ovulation day and have imp. bleeding.  On this website www.peeonastick.com it says that opt's will read high if you are pregnant, so take a pregnancy test maybe.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	It could be ovulation bleeding. You may ovulate tomorrow, I would keep testing if I were you. Good luck!|`|S5n5Za78aa	you should take a hpt and go to doc to confirm it with blood test because woman can still get there cycle during pregnancy
jsoSKMEmaa	My 14 month old had just turned the same way. Not all the time, she will go and play on her own if i start to play with her then gradually move away she'll happily play on her own. She used to be very independant but now she isn't. Like you said she cried for me to pick her up, she has to be sat on my knee or be carried around else she just hangs onto me crying! I have been assured its quite normal and she'll grow out of it so i'm not going to worry. I'm sure your little one will eventually grow out of it to.|`|653j6x9maa	shes just a mamas girl, i was like that when i was a baby and all through child hood, in a way its a good thing, but if she continues to be a mama girl it gets harder as she gets older because she will be so attatched to you! im 20, and when i leave home for a couple days i cry becuase i miss my mom!<br>  she just loves you a lot!|`|dcNmRPGPaa	you may be pregnant.|`|b2xw4P8Eaa	It's the same with pretty much any child. They like to be closest to their mother. This is because you were the only person your child knew when they were inside you for 9 months.<br>  They like to be close to you because, like the pregnancy, they felt safe with you so your child just needs to get used to you not being around that much. Yor daughter will grow out of it eventually.<br>  If she does want to cling on to you, maybe you could play with her to take her mind away from that.<br>  Hope this helps (:|`|7i6qj4OXaa	They go through various phases as you must know if you have other children.  She will grow out of it eventually but she needs you right now.|`|B0dX0GCiaa	Have you ever lost her? or has she some how become frightened when you weren't around?|`|mPpJc2mhaa	Well, have you stopped breast feeding her? If so, this is a major transition for her, moving on to real food. She may feel like she is losing part of her...this may continue for a while, but this will stop, after she is used to the world, and feels more comfortable with her surroundings. She just want;s to feel safe in secure, she's been in a calm place in your stomach for 9 months, just give her time. <br>  She may just be a little momma's girl. I was the same way, but I grew out of it, so will she. Hope I helped! BYE!
LDeRA6eNaa	Yes you can claim them as a dependent as long as they didn't make over $3500 in 2008 he no longer qualifies as a child, but he is considered a qualifying relative, as long as you are supporting him, and he doesn't have to be in school.|`|AA10622097	You can only claim children over age 18 if they are full time college students, and then until age 23.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Only if he is in college or high school.|`|AA11599430	i believe you can if you can prove you totally support him but to be 100% sure ask a tax expert or an attorney that deals in taxes|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	If he's a full time student...until he's 24 years old you can claim him.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Sure, but you will not get any money for him.|`|RLtzqQB9aa	wrong category|`|sDAFygMpaa	Has to be a student...students can be claimed up until 24 i think.

wxbGmxbOaa	Most likely if you had your period you're not pregnant, but to be sure I would get a test. My brother's gf had what she thought was her "period" with both her first and second pregnancies. The first wasn't by my brother, so I'm not sure how far along she found out with him, but I know with my nephew she didn't even find out she was pregnant until she was 5 months pregnant. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, hope it turns out whichever way you want it to.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	If you had your period, you're not pregnant.  If you are still worried though, take a pregnancy test.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	They do sound like some of the symptoms of pregnancy, but the only way you'll be able to tell is by doing a test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
uFrqC4Y2aa	You are going to be able to see the heartbeat at your first ultrasound aroun 6-8 weeks. I think you may be able to hear the heartbeat with a doppler around 10 weeks. <br>  <br>  Don't go to the ER unless you are experiencing bleeding or something as severe, not to see if you can hear the heartbeat. I was just as concerned too... since it's my first.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	with an internal vaginal ultrasound they should be able to see a little blinking heartbeat at about 6-7 weeks, a regular ultrasound may not show a heartbeat until more like 8 weeks.  a doppler (the little thing they use at the doctors to hear the heartbeat) can pick up the heartbeat around 10 weeks but because the baby is so small and moves around alot there is a good chance that they would not find the heartbeat that early.  by 12 weeks they should be able to find and hear a strong heartbeat without too much trouble.  im sure you are just fine, if you went to the ER they probably would not do much for you because its not an emergency.  schedule an appt with your doctor they usually want to see you around 8 weeks, they will be able to order you an ultrasound if there is a concern.  good luck|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Why do you want to go to the emergency room for no reason? <br>  Just calm down! Your doctor will tell you that everything is okay when you go see him.. Plus, if there's a problem with the baby at 7 weeks, there is nothing they can do about it anyways except just let you miscarry.. And you can't even hear the heartbeat until around 10 weeks and that's if you're LUCKY! I went to the doc last thursday and I was 10 weeks 1 day and she didn't even listen for the heartbeat at all. I have an ultrasound on March 5 when I'll be 12 weeks 1 day and THAT'S when I'll get to hear and see my baby's heartbeat.|`|532XA7lkaa	Unless you have unbelievably good insurance, don't set foot in that emergency room unless you are in labor!  <br>  <br>  We couldn't find the heart beat until I was 12 weeks and even then it was very faint.  It was normal and they could measure the beats, but it was quiet, the baby is so small and he/she was moving which made it harder.  I am now 15 weeks and will hear it every time...hopefully it gets easier for the doc...my baby is a mover and a shaker...so I feel bad for the poor doc who has to stand there and listen forever until he holds still!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	When I was 7 weeks and 2 days pregnant I had my first ultrasound and they were able to hear her heartbeat. Why are you worried? Did you have an ultrasound and they were unable to hear the heartbeat?|`|SIp415MFaa	It depends on the position of the baby my midwife couldn't find the FHB until 24 weeks . there's nothing to worry about but if your concerned you could always speak to your midwife.<br>  <br>  everything will be ok <br>  good luck
p33BChZ4aa	Yes, definitely. Make sure you are both fully screened, they will do the usual tests for any STD's, they may ask you if you would like to do an AIDS test, you must do this.<br>  <br>  After this, I suggest you speak to your doctor/family planner about contraceptives such as the pill or implant if you don't want to get pregnant. This is has a protection rate of over 99%. <br>  <br>  But above all, make sure you trust each other because the last thing you want is an STD coming into the relationship from an outsider... Harsh but true|`|i8Ch743Laa	I'd say never,you never want to risk pregnancy/std's. Unless you're ready for a kid,don't do it.|`|23MPcnNqaa	It is okay to have unprotected sex when you are and your partner are strongly committed to each other (or even married).  And when you are BOTH ready to have a baby.<br>  <br>  Yes, you should both see a doctor and get tested for STDs.  If both tests come back negative, you will be safe from diseases.<br>  However, that does not mean that one of you won't cheat and bring the other something back!!<br>  <br>  I would be very careful and make sure that the two of you are that committed to each other before having unprotected sex.  <br>  <br>  You know that having unprotected sex also causes pregnancy.  Are you and your girlfriend ready for that if it happens?  Raising a child is not easy and brings on a lot of responsibilities.<br>  <br>  Please be careful.  And practice safe sex!!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	unless you want a baby, there is no safe time to do this. you dont know when she ovulates and even if you think you do, it can change from one month to the next. also sperm can servive up to 5 days inside her, so even if you have sex one day, it can hang out long enough to be there when she releases her egg. the only thing you should see the doctor for is birthcontrol if you dont want a baby<br>  <br>  EDIT: They do blood work and or a swab to test for diseases and if you are concerned about showing body parts then you are not mature enough to be having sex, never mind unprotected sex. They only 100% way to protect from diseases is abstinenace and that means NO SEX at all, not even naked rubbing of parts. condoms are your option, but they are not 100%.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	you should go to a clinic to be checked over, then its fine to have unprotected sex but only if she is taking birth control, or you want a baby.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Unless you're ready for a baby, then there is NEVER a safe time to have unprotected sex.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	When you are ready to have a baby.|`|mWM6mQDOaa	i think that you should have unprotected sex when the two of you come to an agreement that this is what you want.

mNzgWFkGaa	Hello Lisa,  just a reminder that if your thinking about using a hire car in Greece please do check out the child car seats very carefully, a friend went to Greece and she had to argue with the car hire dealer to change the  baby car seats as they where really old and unsafe, don't know if you are hiring a car but thought that might be useful for you.  think a double buggy would be better for you . Remember a little emergency toiletry bag that you can shove in a few useful items like a digital thermometer, a couple of sachets of anti diarrhoea powder,  some dihoralite sachets,  little tube of bruise cream, couple of plasters , infant paracetamol , after sun cream etc, so you are prepared for any little 'upsets' .   Happy holidays.<br>  <br>  Edit; It's a shame that you have to spend even more money on an essential like car seats ,  ...... oh yes  with safety in mind don't forget to go for the highest level of travel insurance you can , .. I know it's expensive  but   well It's always better to be safe than sorry.|`|g3CrnbhAaa	Well I remember when we went to Spain when my two siblings where small, my parents took the double buggy. Good job too, otherwise exploring the area wouldn't have been so good with two small children in tow.<br>  <br>  Write yourself a list of things you use daily when it comes to small kids.<br>  Then you'll know what you need to take.|`|FQo5UaP0aa	thanks for posting this as :<br>  im going to barbados in april and macey will be nearly two and ashton will be 4months<br>  we'll struggle together!
qJBMdL7gaa	Cute...i would use different spellings probably...but I love the name!<br>  <br>  ~Kayleigh Anne~<br>  ~Kaylei Anne~<br>  ~Kaylee Anne~|`|1S5AbPueaa	I like it nice ring to it:)|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Nice choice.|`|JU351q6Naa	Lovely name but if it was me i would spell it Kaylee Anne. But your spelling is lovely to.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	Very cute:D|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Sounds very sweet.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	i like it that my doughters name
lkhCeAdJaa	Yep..we do.  We have had one for about nine years.  It also has never has a net around it.  Not because we don't want one.  More because when we bought it, nets weren't so popular.  Nothing serious has happened on ours so we've been pretty lucky.<br>  I like having it because the kids enjoy playing on it...kinda encourages them to play outside, which is good for them.<br>  <br>  A lot of he same people against trampolines have a pool in their yard.  a pool poses way more danger to children than a trampoline.|`|oP504BtFaa	We have a trampoline! We got it when the girls were seven and we have the safety netting. We always supervised them, but now that they're older I'm a little guilty to say that I don't watch them as much as I should out there! It's right in the backyard though so I can see it from the kitchen, TV room and computer room.<br>  <br>  How old are your kids? I think that as long as they have safety netting and are constructed properly with supervision the whole time, you'll be fine. They are SO GREAT!|`|AA11210211	I don't like trampolines but that is due to a personal experience,one time I was jumping and a friend flipped me backwards and I came down on my neck,it freaked me out so bad,I couldn't move my neck a certain way for weeks,I don't like them and am kind of leary around them it's the same thing with pools but I almost drowned once too so...|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	We don't have one but I would love to get one. I think it'd be more for me than the kids! Seriously you can get hurt regardless of any toy, but I would get one so the little ones can experience of jumping their brains out.<br>  <br>  To add- I was hurt on a trampoline when I was about 12. A friend of mine was jumping really high and landed on my chest (right on my heart) with his knee. It felt like someone knocked the life out of me and that was a pain I have never experienced in my life. Still to this day I have pains in my heart, but regardless of that I wouldn't subject my kids to not experience just because I was hurt. I fell off monkeybars too, should I ban my kiddies from those as well?|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	My husband was seriously injured on a trampoline as a child.  We still have one for our children, and they absolutely love it-it is a great form of excercise, aside from the fun.<br>  <br>  We do not have the netting.  There may be better kinds, but two families we know with the netting has allowed us to see it, and that netting would do absolutely nothing from the motion of a bouncing child falling out and to the ground.  Therefore, we chose to forego the expense and the false sense of security.  With proper supervision, it is not necessary anyway.<br>  <br>  My 11 and 8 year olds play on the trampoline, and my 1 1/2 (almost) year old does as well, and she also has her own small one with a handrail that she likes to bounce on-an alternative to her jumping on the bed LOL.  She jumps on that inside.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Most kids who were strangled, were not supervised, you are correct. Either that they were playing roughly and there were too many bigger kids bouncing little kids. Even if i was hurt, i would not get in the way of my child having fun. <br>  <br>  We got one for my daughter and son when my oldest daughter was about 12...we got one with the safety net and they did just fine. I think they are fine, it lets the kid jump out some energy and gets them active. I have watched my kids come up with many different games to play on the trampoline, which have lasted for hours. I think they will have fun! You can always jump too lol!|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I will not be the parent that has a trampoline, no way!<br>  <br>  You remember enjoying your friend's... haha, but have you asked those parents how they felt when you were on it?  Liability lawsuit waiting to happen... especially now.<br>  <br>  I think they are dangerous and pose no real positive for the kids.  Sure - they are fun, but so are 100 other things.  I will spend that money on other things.<br>  <br>  Of course you will watch them now, but as they grow up, are you always going to be home to regulate when your 10-16 year old and their friends play on it?<br>  <br>  Too risky for me.|`|WyQuDaRyaa	I grew up on trampolines..my siblings and all my cousins. Now we have a little cousin (She's four.) and she's been playing on our trampoline for a long time now, she absolutely loves it. Obviously, you plan on supervising your children so I think it's a great idea!!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I wouldn't use the possiblity of getting hurt as a con on getting one.  They could just as easily get hurt playing something else...my 10 yr. old trips just from walking!  They are fantastically fun!  I can tell you precisely how many flips it takes until you feel like upchucking!!|`|pA6Ntl2Eaa	I think with anything else they are fine as long as you set rules and stick with them.  I have one for my kids and also have a net.  My children are aware of rules and knock on wood no accidents or injuries yet.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I do not like trampolines.  But I guess it depends on the age of the children.  When they fall, it's not a soft fall.  Trampoline's aren't made of a soft material so even if there is a net they aren't protected.  If they fall wrong they'll still get hurt.<br>  <br>  We bought a "bouncer."  It's a lot softer, inflates in about 15 seconds, doesn't affect my electric bill, and it holds 250 lbs.  My kids love the ones at fairs.  Now they have their own in their back yard.  It was probably cheaper than a trampoline and a lot safer. It even has a slide attached.  All the neighbor kids like to come over and jump as well. It's definitely a hit.  For some reason a lot of people have trampolines, but not a lot of people have the bouncers.|`|im3vWyv6aa	We don't have one... but when my children have been on one, I'm a nervous wreck. It may be my personality though. I can't stand the "idea" that my child could get hurt.<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	We don't have one b/c we have no yard (well, it would fit but there would be no other room, lol).  I tend to be overprotective but you really have to face the fact that they could get hurt anywhere.  They are fun and the kids should be watched while they jump and play.  We never had protective nets on ours growing up and never had a major catastrophe.  Heck, we used to move it over by the pool and do flips into the water (lol.... don't tell my parents though- we were much older).  I think if the children are being watched, it's perfectly safe.
1tmX7xbRaa	well i think 1-4 is usu sally a good time. since there is so many people it may be better to have it from 12-4 or 1-6 something like that. i think it really depends on what you have planned. if there is going to be food then around or after lunch time is best and if there are a lot of games or a lot of presents the extra hour really helps so that you aren't rushing. my shower went so fast it was hard to enjoy but not everyone likes to stay at these types of things for longer then 3-4 hours.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	Wooohooo Gifts Galore!  I am due July 1st and my shower is May 23rd.  It will go for about 3 hours between gifts and eating.  Also it's a shower for my husband and I , makes it more fun and he gets to feel included.  Good Luck!|`|sAbah6dTaa	eighty people? really?
um29wkUPaa	Wait... Where can I find a babysitter that'll do my errands?  I want one of them.  Do I have to move to Spain?<br>  <br>  I don't hire a sitter for errands, but if possible I work it around when Mr. Mozz will be home (to watch them).  They'd rather be playing anyway, and I treasure the time alone, and getting out of Walmart for less than $100.  'Cept grocery shopping, Bear loves to grocery shop with me.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Children learn how to live in life by experiencing it.  For instance, small children do not always know how to behave appropriately in a restaurant but if you never take them, they would never learn.  The same goes for errands such as grocery shopping, the bank, post office, etc.<br>  <br>  My children are 11, 8 and 1.  They all go with me, everywhere.  Literally, because they are homeschooled.  Not only are they very aware of how to take care of basic tasks, because they see it all of the time (which is an issue-I know of a couple of 20ish year olds that can not complete a task such as filling out a change of address form or what not), but they also get "real world" socialization-meaning, not just with those that were born the same year they were and happen to live in the same neighborhood.  They socialize with that teller at the bank, the mailman at the post office, etc.  Those skills are very important.<br>  <br>  For younger children, the different sights, sounds, smells, etc. are all very good and stimulating for them.  Life is a learning experience, and children should live it as much as possible-not be stuck home with a babysitter.<br>  <br>  I will admit that it is sometimes easier to run errands without children in tow, but in the rare cases I do so they are home with Dad-not a babysitter.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Generally I take her with me, but it depends on what it is im doing...like if I have a gyno appt, I try to schedule it while she is at school or her dads or if my mom can watch her, or if I have a dentist appt and she doesn have one at the same time, i try not to take her because I know she will get bored and also might get scared. Regular doctors appointments, grocery shopping, post office etc she comes. She is 4.|`|2fB383F2aa	My daughter goes everywhere with me. It may take an extra 20 minutes getting the grocery shopping done, but it's fun hearing her name (and try to name) all the items on our list. Also with winter, takes an extra 10 minutes getting jackets, snow pants and boots on! I think it's great too that it gets her out of the house, even if it's just to run errands.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I take my son everywhere! The only time I get a babysitter is when I go to my OB appointments and my husband has to work. I can't see not taking him to the grocery store, post office, or even out to eat. I think the more you put a child in the situation the better they will react to it. It honestly makes me upset to have someone call and ask if I can watch their child so they can run to the mall. I guess that is just my opinion.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I am a babysitter (babies? hmm..) for some special needs children.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they ask me to do some errands, and yes, then i take (some of) them with me. (there are 5 of them).<br>  <br>  It`s not necessarily because mother (dad ran off) can`t handle them - it`s because sometimes the kids need a bit of a break too.<br>  And, since i enjoy shopping - why not take the kids - and have an excuse to eat an ice cream :)|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I take my kids.  I think the idea of a nanny so you can run to the post office is crazy!  You had your kids - now raise them!  :)  The only time I get a sitter is for my obgyn appointments and that is only because my office doesn't allow children under the age of 12.|`|5CgvehQHaa	I am a nanny i work 4 days a week while she works she will call me so she can go to an appointment and it drives me nuts! I dont think thats ok. Unless you are going to be gone more than 3 hours dont bother calling me.... I didnt have the children therefore its not my responsiblity to watch them all the time.. and on top of that i am 7 months pregnant and i am a full time student so i dont even have the time to do it. so the my answer would be no just take them or dont go.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I take my son with me, he's only 4 weeks old, but he comes along. He went with me to my OB appointment the other day and the doctor was running over an hour behind, my baby went crazy in there...so from now on I may try to find someone to watch him for doctor's appointments.  Otherwise he goes where I go.|`|prqrQcd1aa	IF i had a baby sitter, i'd either do this myself while she was working, and pay her more...or if i knew she was going that way i may ask her to do some errands for me as well, if she was able to, but i'd pay her more for doing it.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Of cause I take my Boy with me. I am not made of money.<br>  <br>  I do however get Andrew to watch them whilst I see my Therapist, and to have a papsmear. But I mean they are understandable.|`|dgRTkccBaa	I take my kids with me.  I try to make doctor's appointments during times when I know my husband will be home like on the weekends or in the evenings.|`|pA6Ntl2Eaa	I take the kids with me it is a great learning opportunity for them.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Well, I try to get as many of those things done while my son is at preschool three half days per week.  In between, I take him with me.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	HAha..as if I have people to watch him for things like that..<br>  He comes with me everywhere, unless my boss gives me the time to get soemwhere during work hours..he is with me ;)|`|QXREldcEaa	nope - take them with me!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I only have one so I never get a sitter for when I run errands. How hard is it to bring a baby with you? I can understand maybe if you have a bunch of kids but even then why wouldn't you bring them too? Just plan it out. I have seen moms with six or seven well behaved children all shopping together so I know it is possible. If my mom really wants some grandson time I will let her watch him and I will leave but it's not planned out more like, "I was going to run to the store but if you guys want to stay and play that's fine." I think the kids miss out when they are left with a sitter and not brought out on normal outings to interact with the world.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I take them with me most of the time.  I never get a babysitter or leave them at daycare longer for that.  However, I do like to run errands alone if it's a matter of getting in and out of the car.  Sometimes I will run errands while the kids are at home with dad or take only one with me (rotate each trip, lol).  I can run to the grocery store for milk and bread in 16 minutes with no kids and 32 with.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	lol, we used to have a friend who thought we were crazy for bringing the kids with us wherever we go.<br>  <br>  no, we don't get a babysitter.  that would quickly become financially ridiculous (and require finding a lot of new babysitters, since our current one works days).  and while it might be nice once in a while, i think there's some benefit to kids for being part of those activities.<br>  <br>  except for the doctors' appointments, where i have to say i wish we had better backup plans.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Nope, he goes with me!  Well, to everywhere but the doc appts.  I make those during the day (usually during my lunch break).  It's alot easier to just get in there and get out with out taking wild man in there with me, LOL|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	When dad or big sister's not available, I take them with.  Sometimes I take them with, anyway, just for the company.|`|AA11210211	I take my children with me,I see no reason to hire a babysitter when I am capable of taking them with me.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	MOST of the time he goes with me. Once in a while he goes next door to Grandpa's while I go to Wal-Mart (it takes 2x as long to grocery shop with him lol). And I schedule dr's appointments during my husband's time off - I don't think it's very appropriate to take a 2yo boy to the gyno w/ me unless it was necessary. :)|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Gee, no. Part of the fun is having the kids along - and that's where they learn things as well! Teachable moments, that's what all the fun is about!<br>  The only difference would be a dr. apt for me which would require something private (undressing, or to gynie) - but I would do that when my husband were free.|`|NuvKPl3naa	i usually wait until my husband is home for the grocery shopping. but for me i live in a small town so i take the kids, the whole town is kid friendly. if its a long dr's appt i get a sitter other than that they go along. my 4 year old is the hand holder for shots or anything painful.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	No indeed. That would be such a waste of money and I can think of tons of other ways to waste money than that. <br>  <br>  My oldest is in school so unless its the weekend, I don't have to take him anywhere. My baby stays home with my husband.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	they go everywhere w/me.  every once in awhile i go to the store when they are in bed, like if i have to go but the weather is terrible that day or will be the next, but thats rare.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I take my son with me if I have to do these things on a weekday. If it can wait until the weekend I leave him with my husband and go do errands then.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I take them, no fun if I left them with someone.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	They go were I go.
c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	A good education, to me, starts from home.  I think we, as parents, are the best educators our children get.  My daughter goes to public school.  I trust the school to teach her the basics; reading, writing and math.  I have a close, on-going conversation with her teacher, though, so I know her constant progress throughout the year.  It's important to me to have a teacher who is willing to discuss her progress with me whenever I feel it's necessary.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	To me a good education is the process of training and developing the knowledge, mind, character, & thought mechanism of the child.|`|28QPS6V9aa	A school that teaches my children everything they need to know. And a school that has the same beliefs as me.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	that's an enticing question but so broad i'm not exactly sure how to answer it.<br>  <br>  that has never stopped me from answering an enticing question, however. so:   to me a good education meets a child exactly where that child is and then not only teaches the child new things, but also inspires creativity, problem-solving, curiosity, and a passion for learning even more -- and also gives the child the tools so that the child will actually have the skills to be able to go about learning even more.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	One in which the teacher takes the time to figure out how a child learns, what excites that child, what is important in their life, then teaches the child what s/he needs to know to have a full, productive life.|`|NuvKPl3naa	i think its when a teacher does the best they can. keeps up with what is needed to learn at that time. and is there for the child when in need of extra help. not every child will be on track, but knowing the school is backing the child up the best they can is "good education"|`|prqrQcd1aa	I mixture of student, parent and teacher coming together to provide all the necessary things that you need to be taught in order to go out and make it in the real world, as well as the mandated curriculum.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	A good education is one that caters to each child's individual needs and learning techniques. One that enables children to learn in a productive and creative environment.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	not good enough.  Id prefer "great", both provided by the school system, family, enrichment activities, internal motivation, and a passion for learning.
qKnE08Rxaa	The best thing is to ask baby's mom how she does it. My baby's good with me about going to sleep at night but someone other than me is going to have hard time putting her to sleep. <br>  <br>  I don't know how long you babysat this baby for but if you are new with this baby than after a while this baby will get use to what you do for her to sleep. I think what you are doing seems to work in the long term. Stick to it & soon it'll get better.  Good luck!|`|dcNmRPGPaa	baby just doesn't seem to be used to you. you must be new to the job. In my experience it's just the matter of the baby getting used to you and you guys forming a personal relationship and routine|`|TczFL0p0aa	some kids are very used to their mom and dad and ONLY their mom and dad so if this is working for ya i'd continue.<br>  but if you dont like to do this i would lay her down and rub her back in her crib and if she sits up or crys or tries to get up and play or w/e lay her back down (gently but firmly) and say in a firm not angry but firm voice 'its time for bed! good night!' thats what i do when i babysit and the baby acts out.<br>  good luck!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Most 11 month old children like to be free to roam around and do not prefer to be held unless they are exhausted.<br>  <br>  Sooo, exhaust her. Play with her, chase her around and poop her out!!! <br>  <br>  And hey i am sure she doesnt just "Go down like a dream..." That is crap. They like most parents think that they and she are perfect and thats most likely not true.<br>  Also you can put her down at bed time and leave her there. she may cry but she will go to sleep. And you can let her cry she is only doing it because like most children (yes even babies) she doesnt want to be away from the action, she will sleep after a little while.|`|ZfXeR519aa	im nigerian but i live in london and in africa they always back babies i didnt like being held either so my mum got her blanket n put me on her back and wrapped the blankey around me like so: <a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_fvPiPwzaAtg/R8TRfG5M_GI/AAAAAAAAAAc/EFajQX7uGa4/s1600-h/african_baby_sxc_nr_note%5B1%5D.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp2.blogger.com/_fvPiPwzaAtg/R8TR...</a>|`|RAgydY5saa	Your routine seems perfect, but from my own experiences girls are very independent and therefore like to do things for them selves. Stick with what you are doing I'm sure it will pay off!|`|eD687uffaa	shes probably to young to be baby sat.. she probably just wants her mom|`|tLBjsrEFaa	well don't hold it then. if he hates you he hates you|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I would not pick her up again, I'd let her cry for 5 minutes, come back and console her for 5 minutes (don't pick her up), let her cry for 10, console for 5, cry for 15, console for 5, and etc....  Over time she will learn to self comfort, and at her age I would not be uncomfortable doing the cry it out method.   Now, this does not mean allow a child to scream in terror or not dealing with what they need - it means when they are crying an unhappy cry they are still okay and can find it within them to calm and comfort themselves.   This can work well, but some kids can't do it - and if she is screaming so hard she's coughing, her face is purple, she's shivering, etc you know you've gone too far.   I'd also try a quiet story before bedtime to quiet her down beforehand.|`|77NzfiVkaa	If she is out as soon as you put her in the crib why don't you just do that? Seems to me like you are wasting a lot of time and also encouraging this behavior by catering to her every whim. When it is time for bed just put her in the crib and be done with it.
5DJcir9saa	He had a long sleeved onesie with a fleece vest and pants.  I also put a knit cap on him.

Lol|`|bxPaQzWLaa	something cozy and soft that will fit a range of sizes.  My first baby I had a frilly dress that was totally impractical, difficult to put on her, and way to big.  The second baby I had a shirt and pants with feet - the pants literally fell off when you held the baby up (even though they said "newborn" size).  I wound up putting him in a backup outfit - sleep and play type that worked great.  All my babies have been full term and 8-9 pounds but I have a few inexpensive "preemie" size outfits that I put them in to come home from the hospital and wear the first couple of weeks.|`|0zhPDe4zaa	i had a girl so i just went to baby gap and got a turquoise onesie with a built in front ruffle skirt and it had white dots and butterflies all over it and on the top-right side it had a sparkley butterfly sewn onto it with the wings popping out. it was adorable. I also had a white recieving blanket with blue and pink butterflies on it that she was swaddled up in. :)|`|rFRo6DGTaa	I had a baby girl, so I picked out this really cute newborn dress, and was so excited for her to wear it, then she came out 10lbs and 14oz and my husband had to rush home to get a bigger outfit, we ended up putting her in a oneis, I think that's is the most  comfortable for them. remember back a variety of sized just in case :) congrats on your baby to be!|`|EhGR05Etaa	My mother in law actually gave us the outfit she took my husband home in....which was really special.  If we didn't have that I would chose something neutral that way I could pass it on to them and they can maybe use it for their children requardless of sex.  I guess it would be a pretty normal outfit depending on the weather....:)  Good Luck!|`|7ee2e58a43d3c7214fd3e8cb1f2c131eaa	Well Im not sure what to call it,lol.I would describe it as a sleeper without the footie's part.It was green with a hat & matching booties.It was simple & still dressy enough for the hospital pics..|`|AA10496648	I picked my favorite onesie that we had. It was blue with scooters on it. I really should have brought pants because the car seat straps left marks on baby's legs. So pack pants!
S4pNsW3Taa	Its totally normally I didn't go for my until I was 12 weeks and 6 days. There is really nothing they can do before 12 weeks.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	I always thought this was wierd when doctors do that. I have been pregnant twice (the first time was a miscarriage) and every time i called them and told them i got a positive hpt, they scheduled me that week for an u/s to find out how far along i was, and then i had my first ob appt right after the u/s, so they could give me the dos and donts, and give me samples of prenantal vitamins. If you are unsatisfied with waiting, i would find another doctor. Maybe this time, tell them that your periods are irregular and you arent sure how far along you are...that should make them want to see you.|`|uuHPneEcaa	they should see u when ur 6 weeks. But some docs are different I didn't see my doctor until I was about 13 weeks and that was because I had some insurance problems.<br>  <br>  since its ur 1st appointment they will ask u about ur family history and the father's family history, they will tell u ur due date, they will give u a pap smear, they will check ur weight and blood pressure. ( so if they see u at 10 weeks its okay)|`|AA12228565	It's normal.|`|guGO0Pcuaa	I think it is pretty normal.  I am 8 weeks along and my physician told me I dont need to schedule my 1st appointment until I am 10 weeks also.  <br>  <br>  So unless you are having unusual pains or something you feel might not be right i would keep waiting. Congrats on getting prego!|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Usually 10-12 weeks because they will do a vag. exam and take a look to see how things are going.  Some even do an ultrasound at this point to try and find a heartbeat.   If you go now, they will just do bloodwork and tell you to come back in a few weeks.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	It all depends on the doctor, some like seeing you earlier to make sure that everything is okay but 10 weeks is probably the norm.  Good luck!|`|dFo0k3zDaa	yes, i went at 7 weeks. until around that time you cannot hear the heartbeat, at 7 weeks I had an ultrasound to see the heartbeat. <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|OU9xnW86aa	Yes that is completely normal.<br>  <br>  You should get some prenatals as soon as possible though.|`|HMwBx17xaa	Yes I think so although it varies between regions and countries.|`|kH56qw2Taa	yeah its normal i had my first at 10 weeks|`|86PuYgDJaa	I'm 8 weeks and when I rang to make my booking appointment with the midwife they gave me a date of 4th March so i'll be almost 10 weeks when I go. <br>  I don't think they can really tell you much before 12 weeks when you have a scan though so even if you went before they'd just get background info re you and babys father's medical history and they might give you some leaflets or booklets etc. <br>  With my first I didn't find out until I was 13 weeks so just went then and they just went through medical history and booked me in for a blood test. At the appt after that I had a blood test and they booked me in for 20 week scan.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I'd say it's pretty normal.  They only took me a bit earlier since they weren't sure how far along I was at that time.  I had my first trans-vaginal ultrasound at 10 weeks 5 days I believe it was.  It was amazing....you can see more than just the heartbeat (at least we did)!  It was amazing!  But yes, it's normal, because there isn't much that they can do or see before 9-11 weeks along.  Good luck!|`|tDSRmMd1aa	Mine wanted me at 4-5 weeks, i started prenatels and had weekly hcg levels to make sure it was going up...You really need prenatels before 10 weeks. Spina bifida etc happens early and folic acid etc will help lessen the risks|`|NLwwRtwwaa	your ob is probaly talking about your first ultrasoundwhen your that far along. Now if your wondering whether to  recieve prenatal care than you should have a appointment schedule.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Very normal.  There isn't much they can do those first few weeks, and doctors ARE very busy.  The first appointment takes some time, so she has to be able to work you into the schedule. <br>  <br>  (If you have questions/concerns before then, the nurses can help you, or give you pamphlets/leaflets.)|`|v3LnJycKaa	VERY NORMAL, ask for them to call in a prenatal vit for you to the pharmacy, and start taking care of yourself... nothing they can really do before 12 weeks and generally you only have 1 app in the first tri, 1 app every 4 weeks in the second tri, 1 every 4 weeks until 30-ish weeks, then 1 every 2 weeks until 36 weeks, and 1 a week until delivery.

You have to have basic blood tests to prove you are healthy and not take any drug or meds except Birth control, not smoke and not pump for 12 - 24 hours after drinking.

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? NO don't... he on his way now to being paci free.. make sure no one gives him one either. 15 months is old enough (actually past the age of removing the paci). After about 3 maybe 4 days, he will be a paci free baby, give it some time, and don't give him one.|`|lGcpXteaaa	He's 15 months and you seem to have already gone through the pain from breaking his habit already. You would be breaking him from it again in no time. <br>  Personally i wouldnt, i hope to break my daughter from hers at around 18 months...until then she just has it for bed....|`|a7pgX1W8aa	Don't get another one. The sooner you get rid of it the better because the older he gets the harder it will be to break the habit. Hope this helps.|`|krI2fziJaa	If he has forgotten about it, consider yourself lucky! Just go with it and don't get him any new ones!|`|rk3weJHaaa	im probably really stupid but what is a paci? :)
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I would not worry about the Japan trip but, I would think long and hard before I let mine go to DC. As a matter of fact, mine being female, I would say no...<br>  You will be sending your 16 year old into a pit of garbage. <br>  sorry, but I don't trust a single one of them.<br>  Do some serious research about it first.. You want the same Son back that you sent..|`|EXhVHMAlaa	I don't really get why this question is in "Newborn & Baby," but okay.<br>  <br>  No, not really.  As long as both your sons and you are willing and want this.  I'm not sure what the Japan thing is, but I'm assuming it's with a group?  And so is the congress DC trip.  So no, if they are mature enough to handle it then it's fine.|`|AA11573840	No way is that to young if they responsible, which it sounds they are. At 16 I traveled to Scotland alone for 3 months, found a job and worked for a room, three meals a day and pocket money. I talked to my parents perhaps once a month during that trip!|`|tkSXjqhuaa	not if they're responsible.|`|AA10496648	I agree with what the others have said. If they're going to be with a group and have some structure to what they'll be doing, then it's absolutely fine. I went to Germany with a school group when I was 14, and 16 and it was great both times! <br>  <br>  As long as they have something specific to do there, it will be fine.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	As long as they are in good programs with good program supervisors to keep them out of trouble it should be fine. Its not like they are going into the real world alone. They should be okay.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think if you think they are mature enough and you trust them and they have obviously worked very hard then you should let them.
snUDfcfgaa	Not just yours mine does it too. She'll also scratch on the door to come inside so she can puke.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	because thats where everyone has to make a mess - kids must pee there, cat has to puke there, and so does the dog.  its just a rule.  i don't like that rule though.  i wish someone would make a new one.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Chaos theory.  Whatever can go wrong, will.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Dontcha hate that?|`|jLYTKr33aa	I think they know they're going to do it and just want to make us mad.  My MIL's dog is currently staying with us for a few days, and he pees on the floor in a sort of canine temper tantrum when I won't give him a treat, I dare to check the mail without bringing him with me, or I commit another infraction.  He got so mad today that he broke into my bedroom and peed all over both my rug and a pile of laundry that I had just washed - right after I took him out to pee, of course.  I love him, but I can't wait for my mother - in - law to pick him up!|`|jvW3a5GYaa	It must be part of the whole instinct thing - it drives me crazy. They also seem to only have accidents on people's beds - what's that about??|`|5p7gpj36aa	That's because if they are going to eat it afterwards they need some of the little fibers to clean they're teeth.|`|0QYIbn1saa	LMAO, you're so right.  My dog picks the carpet over the hardwood and my cat picks the bedspread......EVERY...SINGLE....TIME!|`|VYRMz5qxaa	Same! But my cat.  We have this little section of carpet, and the rest is hardwood! <br>  Its such a pain to clean!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Mine too...that's also the only spot where she will poop!|`|lXE75yQjaa	One of life's mysteries.<br>  <~~ has gone to all hardwood and tile now for this very reason|`|ZadTQtJaaa	That's so true!|`|KVCabHoeaa	My cat does this too. I'm pretty sure it's so she can dig her claws into the carpet while she heaves.. I don't know if that would be the same for dogs or not, but it kind of makes sense when you think about it!|`|6UqYrQX9aa	they throw up on carpets if their stomach's are not properly digested or if they ate too much.  if they ate sumthing human like they would most likely throw up. final chose their digestive system is weak.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	Ha, I ask myself that all the time, except substitute the word dog for cat.   I have hardly any carpet, and I swear when one of my cats is about to throw up, they suddenly go into panic mode if they are not on a carpet and go looking for the nearest rug.  Usually the paler colour ones too.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Same reason the kids prefer to throw up at 3AM and husbands always want to make out as soon as we start washing dishes.....<br>  Whatever the reason is, just accept it.  It's unavoidable.
aJLx0nhNaa	It's not that big a deal.  It's not really long, but there is a stump.  It's dry and crinkled up.  Eventually it falls off.  Just avoid touching it, but if you do by accident (which is inevitable) they don't feel anything, at least as far as I can tell.  It's just dead skin, essentially.|`|TsnXXfI3aa	its ok to touch it. if it hurts he will let you know. don't worry about it its not that big of a deal.
FmC1TGm5aa	Nothing. I waaaaay over-packed! You really just need a camera, cell and charger, your own pillow, toothbrush and paste, carseat and going home outfits for you and baby. The hospital provides everything else.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Do not use gas drops on a newborn! They are too young! And the drops are entirely ineffective anyway, so skip the extra cost and hassle!|`|9AHGuAEraa	Slippers for my husband. He was walking around in his pjs and outdoor shoes at night. <br>  <br>  And, I thought I forgot my deodorant but luckily I hadn't! I sweated up a storm during labor.|`|AA11327039	Pillow and bath towels.....the ones at the hospital are really really horrible.|`|SDjrojZXaa	shaving cream, body wash, and extra pants because i bled through the ones i had(sorry tmi)|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	1.

Toothbrush,Toothpaste, Contacts case and Solution For my husband. He didn't even think to pack  him a bag duh! lol<br>  <br>  3. My husbands phone charger. <br>  <br>  4.

So I sent my husband home to bring me those! :)|`|e8b18ec35b31a002daa415cda610a727aa	My nursing bra and toothpaste.  :)  Had a toothbrush - but no paste.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My phone charger.

6iCOMx8laa	My son was so intelligent and curious it was ongoing. When he asked questions I answered them, sometimes they led to other questions, sometimes not.  Sometimes I had to break it down into what are you asking and why?  I didn't want to overload him with information he wasn't ready for. As he got older I started with responsibility and STDS and safe sex.  When he was 16, I noticed that condoms were missing.  I asked if he needed me to buy him some he was understandably embarrassed, but said "yes".   I said that I thought he was too young, but glad that he had enough sense to use them.<br>  He did ask questions and knew he could whenever.. It was a little weird in a restaurant once, but we covered it, quietly.|`|jdRKZe18aa	With my 4 kids I promised myself that I would ALWAYS talk to them about personal & intimate things as young as possible since it was NEVER allowed to be discussed in my home growing up.<br>  <br>  So from the time they were YOUNG I would take every "teaching" moment that availed itself and in an age appropriate way I would discuss things of a personal, sexual or sensitive way with the AMOUNT OF INFO given commiserate with their age too.  And, each child had their own 'comfort zone' and my kids would tell me when it was T.M.I. or would also ask more questions and continued to do that as they have grown up.  THey always KNEW Mom would tell them like it was and not be too embarrassed to discuss ANYTHING.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Age appropriate phases. Whenever they ask me a question I answer it honestly. I also encourage questions.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Any time they ask.....talk. My kids know that I do not feel awkward about talking to them and that they can always come to me without feeling embarrassed.  If you keep the lines of communication open, they will use it.|`|hbVbGHEAaa	Tell them that if They have any questions to come to you ask  make it clear that you are there to help ,that can be a embarrassing subject for them too plus they teach all that in school  they will find out.|`|o0QtZ5svaa	I know you asked for experienced parents, and I am not the latter nor by your standards, will I seem experienced. But I thought you might be interested to know that I didn't get the talk. I'm nearly seventeen and I figured it out on my own. Not through the means by which my aforementioned sentence imply, but by watching television, films, reading books (not those kind of books, though) and talking to my friends. I have a feeling much of that information is instinctual, as it seems for most creatures. It appears to me that morons have trouble figuring it out, but clever people can learn independently.
AA11210211	okay dude you have got to stop this because you are making my brain work here!! lol do you see the smoke??<br>  <br>  umm I think it would be good just by it's self.|`|AA11138222	Stynx|`|sequZxauaa	i agree i like the middle name stynx i also like shitanna|`|v6DRUwH7aa	Braunshitta Inamepaunts|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	wow.

Implantation spotting takes place anywhere from 6-12 days after ovulation, it may be that or the start of your period.  I would wait it out until tomorrow and see if your period starts, if not, then test!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck, hope it works out the way you want :)|`|53GH38Qiaa	It's possible! I'd wait a couple days to make sure your period doesn't start and then take a pregnancy test. The spotting could have been implantation bleeding! Good luck, and sending baby dust your way!!!|`|YLXpwqceaa	Sounds like a great possibility! You can spot during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|EUTRJqCsaa	you could definitely be. take a test and put your mind at ease. good luck.
SfludeD5aa	I think the kids would love it!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	They would LOVE it!!!|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	i think that they would really like that! kids like fun stuff like planes and tanks and boats and pretty much anything that makes loud noises or moves haha. <br>  <br>  they would really find that interesting. also maybe you have an old uniform or hat they could actually dress up in they would probably really like that|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Oh I think they would love it! It was very thoughtful of them to send him something, and I think it would be great for them to receive something in return. Kids love to get mail, etc. <br>  <br>  Maybe some neat pictures of him working (minus the heavy artillery and clip of ammo like the ones my brother sent us LOL) would be nice for them to see, too.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think they would love it. they send the care packages so that the men and women know that they are thinking of them and for the kids to get a thank you note back would really impress them. i think it would make them feel special and that what they did is apperciated.|`|ia3XD8KDaa	Yeah,and have them draw pictures and make it artistic maybe even put glitter on the letters to make it fun.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	they'd love it!|`|jRZletbXaa	That sounds very sweet - Great idea!<br>  I wish I could see the children's faces when they see it! - Very cute ?<br>  <br>  Well done and don't let this great idea go to waste...<br>  Carry it out - its fabulous - they will appreciate this loads =]|`|JjnGKcUbaa	Yes go for it sounds great!|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	Yes, and maybe even some small American flag pins or something along those lines.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Absolutely!  My son's class did this and received letters and pics back and they LOVED it!  Thank your husband for all he does!|`|FJZIvANFaa	Lovely idea, & they would love it.|`|a280cc1b0751df0fe9a3f19e7c0be347aa	YESSS!|`|NPAQxqgNaa	They would love it!|`|q88CKp1Saa	I think just getting back a response is a big thrill for kids.  To know that their efforts were not only noticed, but appreciated makes a difference, not only to kids, but to anyone who takes their time and effort to make a difference.<br>  <br>  I think receiving a personal thank you as well as pictures from you and your husband would make a big impact on them and perhaps even inspire them to make more attempts to show they care for something bigger than themselves.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I think the would, I remember making those kinda packages when i was little and i loved to see the people who received them. Most times the kids don't know where this box of stuff is going or who will get it. Its not to be thanked when you put hard work in to something no matter the age.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You might want to consider interviewing midwives, particularly older ones.  Some midwives are used to spotting and even correcting tongue-tie.  When the baby is only days old the frenulum is very fragile and doesn't tend to bleed so it doesn't take much to stretch or tear it.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't choose to use a midwife for your birth you could still use them for a well-baby appointment to check for tongue tie if you find one with experience.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise there is a lot of info here:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/bfhelp-tonguetie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/bfh...</a>|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My son was "tongue tied," but was able to nurse just fine. His wasn't bad, though, and surgery was never brought up as an option. <br>  <br>  The LC at the hospital told me he was tongue tied-The only thing I noticed was that his tongue looked really short. He's almost 3 now, and he has a lisp, which I suspect is related to being tounge tied.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	I dont have this problem BUT a friend of mine was having trouble breastfeeding and the nurse told her to get a nipple sheild - reading reviews and things about them...

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Yeah, my son had his 1st around 10 months. Usually when that happens, you can distract them, remove them from the situation, or away from what ever is frustrating them. Mine son did it because I wouldn't let him play with a wire (safety issue), so I picked him up, took him to another room, and distracted him with something he could play with.|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	Depends on the kid, but if I were to take a stab, as soon as the baby is born she is prone to temper tantrums.

She's still perfect, just A LOT louder too. :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, a tantrum is usually for attention of some sort, so if it is at home, best to ignore it and not give positive or negative attention...if it is out somewhere, i would remove them from the environment until they calmed down, even if that meant sitting in the car until they calmed down, but again, i wouldn't say a work, pick them up, take them out and simply tell them we can go back in when you calm down, and let it take it's course; i think 8  mos is pretty young for a full blown tantrum though...mine is almost nine mos and so far so good with that; i know with my nephew, he was old enough to understand pretty soon that he wasn't getting whatever it was he wanted out of the tantrum and they didnt last long after he figured that out....|`|7AtxrHQnaa	My son threw his 1st tantrum at 6 months.  I couldn't believe it.  I asked the dr at his check up & she told me that it's normal & that they are maturing emotionally.  I had been sitting, playing with him & when I walked away he screamed & threw himself backward (this happened several times before I realized it was a tantrum)!  I just didn't respond to his tantrum (I knew he wasn't hurt).  Everytime he did that I just wouldn't give him wanted he wanted.  I waited until he was calm before giving him he wanted.  Good luck with your little one!
AA10705195	I do think that there will be less private adoptions.  Indiana Democrat Senator Simpson is trying to attach an amendment to an adoptee rights bill that Republican Senator Miller presented.  It basically makes all children age two and over eligible for state and federal adoption subsidies.  I don't think Senator Miller is real keen on that.  I think she is worried about the fiscal budget of Indiana and about the possibility of situations like Adam Herrman.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	I have a friend (I use the term loosely) who had planned to adopt from China.  When she lost her job due to the economy, she put adopting on hold.  She has no intention to adopt from foster care.  I doubt she would consider that option if she had the opportunity to adopt again.  When discussing ethical issues in adoption, her response was, "Seriously???  I just want a baby, I don't want to deal with all that!"<br>  <br>  Another thing...I'd be willing to bet that this recession will only create a larger gap between the rich and the poor, rather than making EVERYONE poorer.  So, the rich will still have their pick of where they want to adopt from.  The poor will simply choose not to adopt.  Or, as others have noted, they might choose to make a buck doing foster care, which is sick.  <br>  <br>  I hope that people don't start adopting from foster care because they've scratched off yet another "better" option.  Foster kids deserve better than that.|`|PKUPgmnwaa	Actually, what I'm hearing from several different sources - the recession is mostly affecting the agencies themselves at this point. I know of three, and one actually sent letters to the PAPs, asking them for more money, ($1000/quarter just to keep the doors open) telling them they were going to contact their friends and relatives for donations (for the agencies, not the specific adoption) and that if they didn't get this money, they couldn't promise they'd still be around in six months.  Good riddance, I say!<br>  <br>  And, there are a lot more people looking into Foster/Adopt.  For most of them, not looking there to begin with had more to do with myths and misconceptions.  They've now educated themselves, and aren't doing it as a third, fourth, fifth choice kind of thing.  Like with everything else in adoption, it's all about taking the time to educate yourself.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	Interesting question. <br>  <br>  Hmmm... for those who are deadset on adopting a newborn, I'm not sure that they would see adoption from foster care as an option unless they could get a baby under 12 months old. However, I do think more people are considering foster care regardless of the current economy. I have had quite a few people ask me about my experience of adopting my son and they felt very much the way we did in that they hadn't given FC much thought simply out of ignorance.<br>  <br>  The desire to become parents is primal, so for those who are adamant about an infant, they will find a way to finance the adoption. Even if it means incurring huge debt.<br>  <br>  And others will simply put their plans to adopt on hold, but I'm willing to bet the majority of those willing to wait already have at least one child.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, as long as there are healthy white infants available for adoption, there will ALWAYS be PAPs ready and willing to adopt. Regardless of the financial hardship.<br>  <br>  My concern would actually surround the number of women relinquishing due to the hard economic times.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	Gosh--all things considered I hope adoption of waiting foster children is one positive result of the bad economy... <br>  <br>  *** However, it leaves an icky taste on my fingertips to type this and imagine people would only do so because they can't afford their first choice and I do hope those who choose Foster or Waiting child adoption don't consider it the same as buying day old bread or generic lables.|`|DGPUdOOjaa	I'm not sure re: your question but I am certain that people will continue to foster as a means to adopt. They can set their own age range at 0-2 and they do have a chance to adopt a baby or young child that way. I wouldn't do it any other way. I got one this way and a 5 yr. old later and it didn't cost anything. In Illinois 96% of all adopted children are those adopted by their foster parents. And if any foster parent is making money off of fostering the child is getting slighted. It's not a money making job.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	No, it means there will be more children who will be pressured into giving up their children because of lack of jobs.<br>  <br>  I think recessions will further marginalize the "poor".|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Its hard to say there are some people who are actually willing to go into debt when they want strictly a baby. They might find other ways to finances an adoption. Or just even save up their money for several years.  Even though foster care is free or low cost brining a child(ren) into ones home is going to cost money. Even if someone gets some monthly money from adopting it’s not going to be that much.<br>  <br>  If someone is so tight for money they’d probably put off adopting at all whether from the foster care system or from an agency  until things are going a bit better for them. <br>  <br>  Then those who are wealthy well the harsh times aren’t going to effect them.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Children in foster care are not the only children who need families. Children who have had both parents die and children in orphanages need families too. I think PAP will just save longer or find ways to finance their adoptions.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	All people are affected by this harsh economic times.  I've talked to social workers in both private agencies and with the state. What they are saying in MN is that the folks with children that used to be barely be able to pay their barely pay their bills (under 40k yearly) who already have children are the "fastest" growing segment of relinquishing parents.  Harsh--but not really surprising.  Plus, I think one of the stats I saw used in private adoption section in YA: 200 potential PAPs  for each newborn who enter the private adoption system in the US.  I dare say that doesn't mean "less private adoptive arent" but just less potential adoptive parents for each situation.  I see many many agencies trying to get more creative to attracts PAPs which I didn't see as much of 24 months ago.  Many PAPs I know are trying to go it alone and NOT go through an agency.<br>  <br>  If you look at the people who would have adopted through private adoption but are not going to now for financial pressure, YES--I do believe more are looking into Foster care. Many folks I know personally are looking into Foster Care as an alternative.|`|UO1QE8phaa	I think outlawing private adoption (of infants or of ANY minor child) would do the most good for getting more children adopted from foster care.<br>  <br>  I don't think economic difficulty bodes well for children in foster care even though womb-fresh adoptlings will NEVER decrease in price.  People are tightening their belts all the way around.  THAT cannot possibly be good for children in foster care -- either waiting for adoption or not.<br>  <br>  People tend to try fostering when other forms of 'income' dry up.  It's a scary and sad thing.  I've seen it in other recessions.<br>  <br>  *sigh*|`|iVcaB9h7aa	What a good question!<br>  <br>  I would imagine the answer to your first question is "yes".  The last time the US unemployment rate was this high was in 1992.  With so many families losing one or more sources of income, with investments down 40 or more percent and with the tightening of the credit market, it's going to be a bleak time for all types of expenditures.<br>  <br>  But it may not be good news for foster children either.  With money so tight, many people may delay pursuing any form of adoption.  If this was ten years ago, I know we would be considering waiting until the economic future looked brighter.|`|zHRWklEWaa	I would think it would go up. There are already far more PAPs then babies.  If women find themselves pregnant in harder economic times they may be more likely to surrender.

Rk87mqkoaa	I had my period at 12 and if your daughter has her before you tell her what it is, you will have made a great mistake with her trust towards you.<br>  The child shouldn't have one talk for everything. Start by letting her know when you are changing your pads (she should have noticed by now if you are not that domb to hide it), then she will ask what it is, you tell her it's period, your menstrual blood, eggs, and so on. then in a few years she will get her and will ask again. It's not like calculating her age to give her a talk. You talk with her all the time and when it comes, you discuss that too. It's living and communicating, nothing to post a question about.|`|AA10747002	I think 6 may be too young for alot of details. Just keep in mind that girls go through puberty at an earlier age then we did. I went through it in 7th grade. They should at least be aware of it though. Not too many details, but something along the lines of... when girls go through puberty our bodies go through a change every month and it is a sign you are becoming a women. They will more than likely have questions and answer as best you can. At that point they will prolly lead the discussion. Good luck.|`|AA12145826	My daughter is 6 and while I haven't had the official discussion with her yet, I have kept it at the forefront of my mind because of one thing: I was 8 yrs old when I got mine. Yep that's right, 2nd grade. Long before the sex ed. discussion that takes place in about 5th grade. Not only that, but it was the day before our class was to go to the civic center to use the pool. As you can imagine, since my mother didn't get her period until she was 16, she never thought she would have to give "the talk" so soon. So, at 8 yrs old, I got a crash course in sex ed, the female reproductive system, and the fine art of tampons ("OB" w/o the applicator mind you).....I think it scarred my mother more than me.<br>  <br>  I'm still not sure how I'll approach it. Its not like she isn't aware that bleeding occurs "down there" since she's walked into the bathroom without knocking a few times, I've just never discussed the details, all she knows is that mommy isn't hurt or dying. I've already discussed with her pediatrician the course of action we would take should she start showing signs of puberty anytime soon (off to an endocrinologist to hold it off for a while, it what he is recommending).<br>  <br>  My guess would be to allow them to come to you with any questions, but also to let them know what signs they should look for within their own bodies so that they can come to you before the "flow."|`|vue9NOhYaa	To be honest, I didn't discuss this with my daughter until she was, IIRC, 11.   (She was a late developer, so I had no concerns that she would get a period early and be scared about it.)<br>  <br>  She had occassionally, when much younger,  asked questions about it ...but it was usually in the middle of the drug store (like when I was buying tampons) which didn't seem like a good time/place for it, so I'd just say somethng like "It's something mommy needs," and let it go at that. <br>  <br>  When she was 11 I asked her if they had talked about periods at all in school, and she said no.  So I gave her the full explanation, and she said "Oh! So that's what all those commercials are about!"  (She finally got a period when she was 14.)|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, they'll probably figure out some stuff on their own, from commercials or friends. I think the proper time to have the puberty/period talk with girls would be about 10 years old. If they ask you about it soonish, just tell them about it in basic details such, and not really go into the full "reproduction" talk. I would sit them down to talk about it when they're in 5th grade, that way they're fully prepared for puberty when it happens. If by any chance they start to show signs of puberty before that age, then you may want to have that talk a bit earlier than planned.|`|CqJpbEA7aa	My mum started her period when she was 9/10, and I didnt start till I was 14, so it doesn't neccessarily depend on the parent. If I were you i'd tell them a few days after their birthday, and just gently mention that yes, if they see a little blood in their pants, not to worry, and to come and tell mummy. Let them know it is perfectly normal, and it just means they are growing up. If you don't tell them, and they spot a little blood on their pants, they might be really worried and think they have done something wrong, therefore might be scared to tell you. <br>  So yes, it does kind of depend on their maturity so if you don't think they are quite old enough tell them in a year when they are 8. <br>  Good Luck x|`|Q1SABrSXaa	I had a talk with my daughter(12) just before she was 11yr old. It was pointless inways before then as with her i 100% knew she'd not start early. She has a hormone problem so needs medication to make her develop and will need further medication to give her monthly bleeds. She started the 1st round of treatment a few months after her 12th birthday so before then we discused how it would work. She'd had a talk in school so knew the main facts but then i told her how it would be for her. I felt it was better for her to have the school talk then me tell her how she differs. that way she did not feel "different" in the class talk. In about 12/18 months my daughter will go onto phase 2 of the treatment which will give her a monthly bleed. The treatment is actually the BC pill,, and before i get jumped on that is the treatment that is given and it's not for Birth control reasons in her case as she can't get pregnant naturally as she has non functioning ovaries/ The BC pills will give her the hormones that she is lacking and give her a bleed which makes her feel "normal" but also helps keep her womb healthy. the hormones also protect her  against developing brittle bones,<br>  My 9yr old knows a little about periods. not all of it but some|`|nfzQkvqraa	My daughter is 7 and we've had the talk.  Mostly because she's walked in on me and noticed blood.  I'm not going to let her get all worked up thinking I'm injured and in pain.<br>  <br>  Kids are maturing (physically)  much younger it seems than they used to.  I never got the period talk from my mom, and I got my period at 11.  I was terrified.  Better safe than sorry.  And it's not at all a scary thing if you go about it the right way.   <br>  <br>  I would say when she asks questions it's time to tell her.  Other than that I'd wait a few years.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	We always had an open door policy on the bathroom when the kids were little.  Through the natural course of life, they saw me dealing with my period and asked questions about it.  I answered them, with detailed information about how it all works.  They both knew all about periods before kindergarten.  It's not that big of a deal, really.  It's just the ovaries & uterus doing their natural biological functions.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my children already know what periods are.  MY daughter age 7 and two boys aged 9&10.  It is a body function, and I did not want them being uncomfortable about it.
7KEI2y4Faa	OMG!!! Sorry but this damn Dr. KIAGCG 110? is a complete MORON!!!! lol I bet she is one of those who insist to say Jessica Simpsom is overweight while wearing size 8!!! Most women would die to weigh 160 pounds and wear size 8...<br>  <br>  I am sure Dr. KIAGCG 110?  is just a big fat a s s  old lady that just sits her a s s  at home, watching Desperate Housewives and eating Twix bars LMAO!!! She should get a life!<br>  <br>  And yes, there is a bunch of girls that don't show until week 20 :) I am sure you will be fine honey! Congrats!|`|6PEOqeLOaa	you have nothing to worry about. Every woman is different in her own pregnancy (even when you go to have more your first won't be like your second.) Don't get discouraged that you don't have a bump yet i remember i was upset about the same thing but now that i am HUGE i wish i was that little again! I know your excited and can't wait but i assure you enjoy these days!<br>  <br>  for the fetal heart monitor..i have read and heard from many moms that they don't work. So don't get discouraged with that either. Im sure your fine sounds like you have been taking good care of your little one<br>  <br>  be patient good luck!|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I'm 17 weeks with my second pregnancy and most people can't tell I'm prego and I'm in my mid-30s.  Many women can 'hide" their pregnancies through the 5th month (weeks 17-20) Especially if they don't gain too much weight.  You shouldn't have gained more than 10 pounds by now.  I bet most of your friends have gained 15.<br>  <br>  With my 1st pregnancy everyone thought I was "too small".  I always mentioned this to my doctor.  She kept telling me that I measured just fine.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry, but please mention it to your doctor.  You'll be feeling the baby move soon and that will put your mind at rest.|`|JvcJs8k9aa	i am 26 weeks and if you didn't know i was pregnant, you wouldn't be able to tell at all! i've only gained 4 pounds so far, but everything with the baby is healthy. it depends on where the baby is sitting. in my case, she is extremely low.|`|8x9WKvNTaa	Yes it is very normal for a non overweight person, trust me, by the time you go for your next appointment, you will have your own small bump. : )|`|W03Uc369aa	it's normal but very uncommon. I had a friend that didn't start showing till her last 3months of pregnancy|`|fs8BFZAzaa	at four months your baby is about 5 inches long and weighs about 5 ounces. that's not very big so most women are not showing at this point, so no need to worry.<br>  <br>  by five months your baby will double in size and you will notice the baby bulge in your belly. so relax and eat properly and get some rest because you won't be able to rest ever again once the baby is born!<br>  <br>  why would you want to use a fetal heart monitor? you are just stressing yourself out unnecessarily! women have been having babies for eons with out a heart monitor.  the baby's heart beat will resemble the sound of a washing machine that is agitating, it won't sound like a regular heart beat.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It is common not to show at this point in the pregnancy especially if this is your first pregnancy, you should start to show sometime after 20 weeks, as far as the heart monitor I am not sure because I never got one but I have heard of women who it didnt really work for, I am sure everything is fine. Good luck.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i am sure u have nothing to worry about. I didn't start showing until I was 5 months.. I am sure everything is fine, if u feel like something is wrong then see if u can get an appointment sooner.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Don't freak...everyone is different.  I'm 19 weeks tomorrow and you would never know I'm pregnant.  I'm only 90 pounds right now (I've always been itty bitty).  The doctor told me from the beginning that I probably won't show until 6 months.  She said I have strong abdominal muscles so don't expect much of a baby belly right now.  As far as those home heart moniters...don't be disappointed with that either.  Those are basically stethoscopes...not like the doppler the doctor uses.  They're kind've worthless...all I ever hear is my own hunger pains (LOL).  Its not because you don't have a stomach...my doctor said that not having a stomach makes it easier to hear (she heard my baby's heart beat at 3 weeks).  If you really want to hear the baby at home then you may have to rent the home dopplers (buying is crazy expensive).  Good luck to you!|`|em8A42Bqaa	I didnt start to show until 20 something weeks maybe 23 or 24.  The fetal heart monitor doesnt work, we put the earphones to my stomach and to talk to her so that we wont feel like we wasted money.  :)  I weighed about the same as you and I first noticed the change in my boobs then came the belly!|`|xnhwmontaa	My husbands ex never showed until she was eight months and she was a tiny girl! the baby was born and was like seven pounds. <br>  <br>  I'm sure your fine. An ultrasound will measure your baby to make sure he or she is growing on the right track! Good Luck<br>  <br>  By the Way those heart beat thing dont work for some women. Never worked for me my friend or my SIL|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I didn't show until I was over 20 weeks and even now people think I'm not as far along as I am. My sisters were huge at my point. Hey, I have a higher chance of NOT getting stretch marks the way they did!|`|nFj30sZcaa	It's perfectly normal to not be showing yet.<br>  In general, pregnant women get there first "pop" and start to show somewhere around 15-18 weeks. But, every pregnancy is difference.<br>  If you have friends who are as far along as you are and have big bellies, it is probably from overeating which isn't a good thing! (So, don't be jealous of it. You're not "eating for 2" and don't need to overeat and gain unnecessary weight)<br>  I didn't really start to noticeably show until about 20 weeks... and I'm now 25 weeks and still wear ALL of my pre-pregnancy clothes!<br>  Every pregnancy is different and you will show and get bigger at your own pace. If it concerns you, talk to the doctor to make sure you and baby are healthy... but if I were you I wouldn't be too concerned with me.|`|AA11961672	Everyone is different and depending on how your uterus is positioned you might not show for awhile. <br>  I was almost 30 weeks before anyone could tell I was pregnant.<br>  And unless you know what you are listening for a fetal heart monitor is a waste of money, those weird noises you heard is most likely the sound of your own blood moving through you body or the blood going through your little one's body : D <br>  <br>  and while pregnant always remember, Never worry or stress out until there is something to stress about.<br>  best piece of advice I ever got : D|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	It's normal to not be showing yet.

If it's the Walmart kind, those do not work at all!!|`|sstNdyYVaa	hey hun<br>  <br>  not to worry, im 19 weeks and im barely showing too! everyones genetic make up is different and it doesnt mean that something is wrong! ur okay!!!!<br>  <br>  your fetal heart monitor thingi shuld work, maybe its not working properly thats why u cant hear it?|`|52U22fiAaa	You'll show eventually, then you won't remember what it's like to have a flat tummy!

vue9NOhYaa	Your body will work on its own time-table. <br>  <br>  To help matters you can put cabbage leaves in your bra, take antihistimes, avoid handling your breasts or pumping/expressing, don't let the water hit them in the shower, and wear a snug bra. (Not tight -- you don't want to block the ducts and get mastitis.) <br>  <br>  Whatever happens, nobody can force you to breastfeed your baby if you don't want to.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Just leave them alone. That is the quickest way. So demand means no supply. Although I have breastfed all 3 of my children, that was MY choice. You do not, in ANY way need to make excuses or feel guilty for not doing the same.<br>  Cabbage leaves may help relieve some of the pain but will smell horrible once your body heats them. The "medication" your doctor can give you will not really help. They used to do that as a matter of course, but it has since been shown to not really do anything.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	There might be a medication your doctor can give you. Otherwise it takes a while. I'm not sure why you are so against breastfeeding. You can pump your milk and give that to your baby, breastmilk is especially important for premies. You don't have to directly nurse and even a few months of getting just a bottle or two of your milk will immmensly help your baby. Why wouldn't you want that?|`|9IDDxwoaaa	I know it sounds weird but you can put cabbage leaves on your breasts and it will dry your milk out! I did it and it works.

These were eventually found to have other brain-related side effects and taken off the market for milk cessation (Stehlin, 1990). Ice use was suggested in 1966 (Bristol, 1966), and both fluid restriction and forced fluids had time of popularity. Breast binding with ace wraps became the next form of care, with little scientific supportive evidence. A recent clinical study by Swift and Janke (2003) compared a control group using a support bra with an experimental group having their breasts bound. Swift and Janke found the women with bound breasts had more leakage, more pain, and needed more pain medication than the non-bound group. A study by a group of nurses in Sweden (Radestad, Nordin, Steineck, & Sjogren, 1998) did find that for women who had lost a baby, breast binding served as a concrete reality of the loss and aided in the grieving process. The use of cabbage leaves has often been suggested to ease the pain of lactation suppression. Several early reports indicated comfort to mothers, and this is a frequently recommended practice. Yetina Cochrane Library examination of evidence (Snowden, Renfrew, & Woolridge, 2003), cabbage leaves and other vegetable substances on the breast did not show greater comfort than the placebos. It was suggested that placement of the leaves on the breast and the massage of placement may be the helpful issue. The same results of improvement equal to the placebo occurred for the use of ultra sound to the breasts

Unless there is a reason, you don't have to take off before the baby gets here. That is totally up to you. I don't blame you about wanting the most time you can get after the baby gets here.

ZT7IcihCaa	Endometriosis is highly genetic (you're six times more likely to have it if your mother or your sister have it), AND it's a pretty common condition. About one in ten women in the US have endo. This means that, if you are closely related to a woman who has endo, your chances are quite good that you will have it, too. It's unfortunate, to say the least, especially since it is a top cause for infertility among women.<br>  <br>  Other women's reproductive conditions have been shown to be genetic, but I'm not knowledgeable enough on all those to really say what those stats are.<br>  <br>  You are absolutely right that your trouble conceiving is quite possibly due to your genetic predispositions being stacked against you.<br>  <br>  There is actually some research being done to identify the genetic markers for endometriosis, in hopes that soon there can be a diagnostic test that can alert a woman to her chances of developing endometriosis BEFORE she shows any symptoms, which will allow her to take a preventative measure to control it.

AA11604591	ok mom so you make a date to make the transition. lets say at 2 years old. On her 2nd birthday you take down that crib and you set up that toddler bed and you tell her, look your becoming a big girl now and you get to have your own big girl bed and make it really exciting for her. I have always used a toddler bed simply because Its not going from the safety bubble feeling of a crib to this huge giant bed, she would adjust well to having something that is still just her size. Good luck with everything|`|KmC0K59taa	Mine is 22 months and still in her crib.  It converts into a toddler bed, but she has never tried to climb out of her crib.  Her bedroom is only 2 feet away from our stairs and I'm afraid she will get out of bed in the middle of the night and tumble down the stairs.  I'm going to wait a little longer.  I also think that she would not stay in her bed and bedtime would become a huge chore.|`|aLHNF9peaa	My daughter is almost 2 and still in her crib. I think I am going to wait until she is 2 1/2 or even older to put her in the toddler bed. If I were you I would just try the toddler bed whenever you felt ready to. There's no big hurry.|`|AA11109728	I switched my daughter over a bit later than most people, she was 3 1/2 yrs. and we were working on night time potty training.  She never tried climbing out of her crib, and she was always small enough for it, so I kept her in it as long as reasonable too.  I went to a toddler bed because like you, it was given to us.  So I figured, why not?  At the age of 3, I also was comfortable with my daughter getting up in the middle of the night to go potty if she needed to, she knows enough to get up, do her business, and then go back to bed.|`|4MTJ07F3aa	i just went trough this with my daughter who is 25 months old. She loves her big girl bed. And like the other lady said make a big thing out of it right before her second birthday. Something you can do together. It is part of letting them grow up and learn Independence. As for switching Straight to a twin you could but this is easier for them to get in and out of.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I personally switched my son to a toddler bed at 10 months cause he climbed out of the crib (scariest day of my life to find him hanging by one arm when I heard noise on the monitor). The toddler bed was wonderful and there were times that he would put himself down for a nap. It only took a couple days for him to learn to stay in the bed and not get up.My husband and I then moved him to a queen size bed around 15 months old cause he was too tall for the toddler bed. I personally will just transition straight to the queen size bed with my next child but only because I don't feel like buying a toddler bed and we already have an extra queen. If someone gave you the toddler bed I would use it for a while to see how she adjusts.|`|ENANtueuaa	You could keep her in the crib for now, since she's not trying to escape. Why ruin a good thing! I switched my daughter to a toddler bed at 16 months, but she wasn't trying to get out of her crib, i just felt it was time. It took awhile to get her to learn to stay in the bed at night, but once she was asleep, i didn't have any problems at all. So, it's really your choice. I used a toddler bed, made by little tykes. She used that until she was 4, then i switched her to a full size bed. I don't think it matters if you use a full size bed or toddler bed. Just make sure to use a guard rail with a full size for sure, and you might need one on the toddle bed too. Mine had higher sides, so we didn't need one. Hope this helps!|`|pOwOYqhEaa	We used a toddler bed for our first son because I thought it was so cute, but he kept rolling out of it, until we got rails he liked being able to get on and off on his own. He only slept in it about 3 months before we got him a twin bed because he really needed more space. Since the bed was given to you then no harm in trying it out for a while.
zC2900V8aa	I wouldn't do archer myself.  I wold definatly go with Damon.  Damon is greek and means constant it also means tame from the Irish origin.  The popularity of that particular name has gone way down which makes it nice since in the 1970's it seemed to be pretty high in popularity!  I also like Damani it gives it a little twist.  Archer is of teutonic origin which simply means the archer.  This name seemed to be popular in the 1980s but has also decreased in the US since 1989!  I think when picking a name the origin, meaning, and popularity are the three most important things when picking a name.  Also you need to think of how that name can be used to make fun of your baby (rhymes or songs that may make that name horrible to live with).  Hope I helped!

50lIaC8zaa	My daughter just turned 9 months and she has been pulling herself up for about a month now, she has also fallen a few times once she actually drew blood it was horrible, as she has quite a few teeth when she fell she banged her face and one of her teeth cut the inside bit of her lip and it bled for about 5 mins but stopped just as quickly as it started and once she calmed down she was fine.<br>  <br>  There isn't really alot you can do apart from try to keep an eye on her and be close by so you can grab her if she starts to fall, or if you do have to leave the room for a minute leave her in the middle of the room with nothing around she can pull up on (that will only work if shes not crawling, mine isn't).

Just make things a safe as possible, thats pretty much all you can do.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	if your baby's body (muscles and bones as well as mental development to put those in action) is ready for this activity, then there's nothing you can do to stop her.. the only things you can possibly do is to stay watch to make sure that you can soften the blow when she falls, that's all.. i know that it's heart breaking to see a baby fall but it sounds like you are more upset than her.. one thing that i have to tell you though - and this comes from a pediatrician with over 30 years of experience - there's no way a baby would hurt itself much because when we adults fall what happens is that we all stiffen up anticipating the fall while babies are totally relaxed, therefore there will be not much (if any) damage done.. when it comes to hard surfaces though, see if you can get those corner bumpers.. some babies are just too active for their own good - but they are babies and all you can do is watch them.. (((hug))) it will all be alright|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	yes, my 7 month old has been pulling to stand for a few weeks now, and he was pulling up on a chair and he fell and hit his head on the cerimic tile in my house, well by the time i got to him he held his breath and passed out, when I picked him up he was limp, so I had to blow in his face and finally he caught his breath, it was so scary. I'm also worried about him pulling up and falling I watch his every step now. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: very terrified my other two children were so freaked out. This is the second time he's done this, he's very brave he will pull up on anything, I dread when he actually starts walking.
UnZcOUFVaa	I think Zahara is the nicest sounding name of the lot. None of them really seem to go with the other names, though.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	They are ok.  I have to say though some of them are just as strange as Zuma like Zahara for example.  The only names I really like from their list is Maddox and Shiloh.  Knox is ok.|`|UgvLTFmSaa	I like the 1st one and 3rd, then 4th.|`|c03b5354b83affe60fb59f4c39c3c193aa	I love Zahara Marley Jolie-Pitt.

I think they are the prettiest names of the bunch. They sure do have beautiful children, don't they?|`|61NKzPzMaa	Maddox Chivan & Pax Thien. I prefer Pax as a nickname though.<br>  <br>  I also like Léon & Vivienne.|`|gM552VZOaa	No I think they are not good games they only picked them in an attempt to seem interesting but they just come off as pretentious.|`|9X0VXXYYaa	Vivienne Marcheline Jolie-Pitt<br>  <br>  that one is beautiful!! very unique, but very nice!|`|x2mgUMb6aa	think of the children before saddling it with an outrageous name.<br>  school bully!!!|`|Vvahm0uKaa	I love the twins names Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline. :)|`|o4NRcsAHaa	i love shiloh nouvel jolie pitt|`|a7yQGSX6aa	I hate these names!!!!!|`|CxsTfWH2aa	they're all pretty awful<br>  very pretentious.<br>  angelina jolie is a waste of person anyway<br>  stupid woman|`|1Qha5gwVaa	Zahara Marley|`|AA11653243	My favourite is definitely Vivienne Marcheline.|`|Yb1Z27jDaa	Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt...

b8f0CfSsaa	The best thing you can do is balance your diet with fruit, veg, good protein (chicken, fish, steak, avocado) and wholemeal carbs. Allow yourself a treat once in a while, otherwise you will just go crazy and have a major gorging sesh which isn't good!<br>  <br>  You mustn't eat:<br>  <br>  *Steak or lamb that isn't well done.<br>  *Too much tuna, salmon, mackerel (no more than 3 portions a week)<br>  *No soft cheese (Brie, Stilton etc)<br>  *No nuts (baby might be allergic)<br>  *No shell fish (baby might be allergic)<br>  *No pate<br>  *No Caffeine (which means no more than a chocolate bar a day)<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|Nux5S6oVaa	First congratulations!!  I've been following your TTC and hoping for a BFP.<br>  <br>  Second make sure you're taking your prenatals...did you make an appt for bloodwork! (confirms)<br>  <br>  Third: You can eat just about anything...just in moderation.  Try to stay away from uncooked deli meats for the risk of listeria...Limit Shellfish to twice a week for mercury and idodine.  Drinks lots of water...greens, and fruits/veggies.  Peanut butter is great because it provides protein. Most Nuts are ok...in moderation.  This said- If anyone in your family has allergies to food they need to be avoided.<br>  <br>  Congrats again!|`|winmjHAmaa	Hey there!  I remember you from the TTC section where I too, was hanging out last month.  Just wanted to say congrats!  I am learning as far as food, too.  Go on Parenting.com - there is lots of nutritional info that will keep you healthy until you get to talk to your doctor!  Make sure if you are not already taking prenatals that you start.  If they do not contain a good level of Folic Acid, go to the grocery store and pick some up.  About $4.00 a bottle and contains 290 pills.|`|5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	welcome to the 'very addicting' P&P lol<br>  CONGRATULATIONS :)<br>  <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice/facts/pregnantdiet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice...</a><br>  this has loads of info !<br>  <br>  To avoid:<br>  Vitamin A (pate, liver...)<br>  raw meats<br>  some cheeses<br>  <br>  take your vitamins!!<br>  xx|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun!

Try to stay away from hot dogs. Lunch meat should be heated before eating. Nothing with raw eggs...I think you aren't even suppose to have sunny side up eggs? No raw fish, or any raw meat for that matter. No artificial sugar as in diet pop. No caffeine (they say you can have some, but hardly any). <br>  Do eat lots of veggies. fruits, and protein, and take your vitamins!<br>  I'm sure if you eat something off of this list it won't cause you to miscarry, but they just warn you to stay away from this stuff.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	Hi again Cakies!!<br>  <br>  Replied to your BFP post on TTC earlier!!

You midwife should give you a little book about it all.<br>  <br>  Congrats and hope all goes well (no morning sickness!).

MLPzeOtOaa	I would keep up with the M theme. I like Milo, and it goes well with the other names. Good luck on your decision!|`|OBn4a7rzaa	i love the name jack. I would do whatever you want to do...but every family i have met that had a different letter, after keeping them the same, ended up with a crazy youngest, lol. They were always a handle full and didnt walk the straight line like the other siblings that had the same letter. lol.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I would keep the M, I like Milo and Mae is cute, Myra is also sweet. Good luck.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	im not crazy on siblings names all having the same letter<br>  <br>  so me personally i would change it|`|eJMIazhLaa	If it's a boy maybe keep the M names going, but if it's a girl, it's up to you.  If you didn't mean for it to happen and you just liked the name at the time, then go for the name that you like the most now.|`|VPOaunmvaa	I would use an M name if it's a boy and not if it's a girl :)<br>  <br>  So Milo Jack for a boy and maybe Mae Phoebe for a girl?<br>  <br>  Unless you want to use Mae but I think you could start a new tradtion for girls.<br>  <br>  Plus Milo is really cute.|`|wuqJZUauaa	My mom did the theme too<br>  <br>  Aaron<br>  Alyssa<br>  Alex<br>  <br>  I like the themed idea, however, I think that there are better names that start with M out there for girls. Milo is sort of cute...<br>  <br>  Maybe you could use one of these<br>  <br>  Madeline<br>  Mahayla<br>  Mikaela<br>  Miranda|`|ln0wLqZhaa	yes keep the "M' going , Personally I know I would feel very out placed if all my siblings had "M" names and i didn't . But thats me , Cute name by the way :)|`|guVczXfUaa	I personally hate it when parents name their children on a theme.   I went to church with a family who had seven children, and all their names started with K.  Nobody could remember their names and it drove everybody nuts, especially the kids.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	Keep the M consistency(:|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Keep up the M theme - that is exactly what I did - <br>  <br>  Mom to Michaela, Macy, and Marcus Clay|`|xCeaVqItaa	Yes keep the 'M' name going.|`|CqJpbEA7aa	Well, if this is going to be your last child, I would consider keeping the M, as this child may feel left out if it's the only child beginning with a different letter. If you think you are going to have more children how about changing it to another letter that baby number 3 & 4 could share. I think that would be cute! But go for a name that you think matches the baby, and that you like anyway, not just because it begins with the letter M. <br>  I love the name Mae - It's so cute! Just a suggestion - Melanie, Melissa, Millie or Melody are more options of girls names beginning with M. Milo is a nice name but it reminds me too much of the tweenies character. I also like Marcus, Marley, Matthew and Martin. <br>  Names that I really love are: <br>  Tiffany Anne<br>  Felicity Elizabeth<br>  Liberty Faith<br>  Melanie Grace<br>  Connie May<br>  Brittany Rose<br>  (I know there is a lot!) I also like Lily, Holly, and Brooke<br>  My fave boys names are<br>  Oliver Lee<br>  Alfie Scott<br>  Charlie Jay<br>  Alex Joshua<br>  Elliot Thomas<br>  <br>  Just to give you a few ideas on non M names. Your boys names are SO cute!!! They go really well together, and aren't too common, and aren't too unknown (You know the kind of names that teachers can't pronounce) ! <br>  Anyway Good Luck :) x|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I think I would use an M.  Why not?  Milo and Mae are nice names although they wouldn't be my choice.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Jack Milo & Phoebe Mae
deIzFnV8aa	Try applying Aquaphor after washing and drying the area. It is basically a very thick vaseline, which will seal out any moisture from drool or spit up.  Its the same principle as applying diaper rash cream to protect the bottom.  If you don't want to get a special cream, you could also try it with just regular vaseline.  Aquaphor is available at drug stores, target, etc, near the baby lotions.|`|qayCggxMaa	If it is actually a yeast infection you will need to get special antifungal ointment (nystatin or similar) from the doctor in order to clear it up.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? the main thing is just to keep the neck clean and dry, use a baby wipe every so often threw out the day to wipe her neck. I put a small rag or towel under my baby's chin while I was feeding him to limit some of the milk from getting on his neck.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	nurses at the hospital (when my daughter was born) advised me against the powders since if not carefully applied, can scatter around and can be inhaled by the baby.. therefore, the only options are the ointments.. i tried vaseline but it's too greasy, so i am sticking with a more natural and better for the skin baby oil :)|`|0UzfNoA2aa	hi i had the same problem with my little boy who is 5 months suggestedling alVaselineealth visitor suggested using vaseline on this chin, neck and chest 2 act as a barrier. Seems to do the trick.|`|EhGR05Etaa	You may want to check with your doctor actually taking a bath every  night isn't good for babies skin.  I am not sure if you are doing a full on bath everyday or not....but I know if that's the case bathing everyday can dry out skin.  If you're just using a wet washrag or something on her neck then maybe try some hydro-cortisone cream...if the rash is dry....otherwise I would ask my doctor what kind of skin cream I should give!  But experts say that's a sign of teething also....so that may also be the issue...which the drooling and stuff is unavoidable....|`|NZ7zg8e4aa	My son drooled till e was too! He was quite chubby so his neck was always irritated try corn starch powder it worked for me!|`|dTPg4uYzaa	its probably just from her drool for her chin try puttin some vaseline and around her neck put some baby powder on her see if that will help
S5n5Za78aa	NO!  you should see your doctor that kind of medicine has to be presribled at a specific dosage and time frame of your cycle  and monitored with ultra sounds to check if you hav not developed any cyst or anything and if you have insurrance its not that expensive at all<br>  you can really mess yourself up if your not under doctor supervision|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I wouldn't recommend taking anything like Clomid over the counter. I would just go to the doctor. I wouldn't want to take a chance with a fertility pill. Plus I only paid $4 at Wal-mart once I had my prescription cause it is on their $4 list of meds. A lot of places have one of those lists now.|`|u6K7atx7aa	Most likely this website was selling them WITH a prescription. I agree with everyone else. There is a reason why you go to your doctor to get Clomid. It's to follow up with the appropriate care whereas just getting them online is a bad idea.|`|mY19PPlIaa	No dont do it. Your doctor will know when you need it and when to prescribe it. Just go and talk to your doctor instead.
0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Unless I personally know the reception staff and know that they have the time/resources to watch my kids, there's no way I'd leave them out in a waiting room by themselves, even now at 7 & 9.  Too much could happen during that time.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd reschedule the appointment.<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA: The children's play areas in medical offices is not intended as a place for parents to leave their children, unattended, while the parent goes in to see the doctor.  It is intended as a place for the children to play while waiting in the boring medical waiting room, with their parents, until it is their turn to go in & be seen.  <br>  <br>  If I was in your situation and truly had no choice but to go in with no babysitter, the children would come into my appointment with me and sit on the floor, out of the doctor's way, with a toy or video game.   It would take longer, I'm sure - but, with dentist being 'grandpa', they should listen to him, too, when he says 'be still' and he will have a caring feeling towards them.  No way I would leave them unattended in a waiting room (or anywhere) at that age.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	they go into the room with me and sit in the chair|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You can't leave kids that young in the waiting room alone.  There are all kinds of things that could happen and the staff can not watch them for you.  You need to bring them in with you.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	not a shot.  I would take my 10 year old and let him sit there. (as he is very responsible) But never my 9 year old son, and 7 year old daughter. I would not trust them.  No way can a 3 & 5 year old wait 15 minutes unsupervised.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I bring my children and take them in the room with me.  I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving them in the waiting room out of my ye eight.<br>  just my opinion.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	One of the staff use to help me out by taking them in another room and playing with them. That was so nice of them.|`|oRUG4VbJaa	I wouldnt say leave them in the waiting room you never know what could happen someone could snatch them and take them and you wouldnt know..<br>  take them back with you and bring some stuff they enjoy doing coloring,toys,etc.. you know your kids the best and if your grandpa is your dentist he'll understand why they are back there with you...|`|pRpUBJDzaa	well my brothers are 1 and 2 (almost 3 march 2):]<br>  <br>  haha anyways<br>  <br>  when i have an appointment<br>  my mom leaves and its like im the adult<br>  and then i bring them back with me<br>  and give them a snack<br>  animals and coloring books|`|75a51a8a2488a3df797e37d0a25b999caa	That's too young to be leaving them by themselves in a waiting room. If you can't find someone to watch them then you need to reschedule the appointment.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	I don't think leaving them unattended in the waiting room is a good idea....|`|jLYTKr33aa	They should go in with you, not wait in the waiting room.  Receptionists aren't babysitters, and your children will not be properly supervised if you just leave them on their own.  You wouldn't (I hope) leave them alone at home for 15 minutes, so you shouldn't leave them in the waiting room for that long.  Either hire a babysitter, or bring them in with you.<br>  *ETA*  No, the toys are not there to babysit children, they're for children who are in the waiting room with their parents.  You don't "think" your kids will get snatched?  Yeah, neither do most parents of kidnapped children.  Again, the office staff are not babysitters.  If you want to take a careless risk with your own children, go right ahead.  Let's just hope that we're not hearing a tragic story about them on the evening news in the near future.
c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	So I guess you're a pro at checking your CM and cervical position? Then maybe you are having anovulatory cycles? When you have all the symptoms of ovulation but there is no egg released. Or I have a friend who was in your position and found out that her CM was too acidic for her hubby's sperm and it was killing it off before it could make the journey too the egg. Maybe you ahould both get checked out and make sure everything is healthy (and your hubby has good swimmers) and you have optimal conditions for concieving. Otherwise, just make sure you are having lots and lots of sex (duh) whenever you start having ewcm. And try not to worry, you're time will come I'm sure.|`|AA12362903	We tried everything from Clomid to charting to surgery and nothing worked for seven years.  We finally gave up and just bought a house in the country and decided to take a break.  Two weeks after moving into the house we conceived naturally!  Then we had two more during the next few years.  My advice would be to take a breather and relax for at least a few cycles.  Go enjoy a bed & breakfast or travel if you like.  Do something that you both enjoy.  After the little ones come that freedom is gone (for a few years) but it is so worth it.  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  p.s.  I just remembered something that helped me track my cycles!  It was a little lipstick-sized ovulation predictor microscope that could see when I was fertile.  I bought it on eBay and you use it to test a small bit of saliva.  I'd highly suggest getting one of these.|`|yp9rEMSraa	Have you guys been tested with no issues?  I started using a fertility monitor this month and found out that i have been ovulating earlier then i though!  My husband decided to take one of those at home sperm count test and realized that he had a lower sperm count so he started taking fertilaid....I heard that black cosh helps with fertility but i am skeptical about that one....I have found that this whole process sucks!  and I wish i would just get prego but i have found message boards and this place has helped me calm down....Dont give up and know that there is a bunch of us out there TTC with no luck!  Lots of baby dust your way!|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	Trying using preseed.  It is a lubricant that creates a friendly environment for his boys to swim in.

xRZ1PRZwaa	13 weeks is very, very early for symptoms of teething. Although it's not unheard of, it is very unlikely.<br>  <br>  At his age, you should probably bring him in for a quick check with his GP.<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!|`|nmu6coapaa	Yea he probably is. My son is nearly 12 weeks and he's started teething too!|`|LmgDTXTlaa	It could well be (the lady who said 13 weeks is too early is wrong - My daughter teethed from birth and cut her first tooth at just after 4 months) Babies can be born with teeth as well. If his diarrhoea continues tomorrow see a dr to make sure he is keeping his fluids up. My daughter recently had diarrhoea because of teething and i used Aston & Parsons teething crystals, they are non medicated so you can use as few or as many as you like. I gave my daughter one before bed and one in the morning for a day and her tummy was fine.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Fussing, drooling, and even diarrhea can just be normal baby behavior.  13 weeks is young for _typical_ teething, but that of course doesn't really mean much as far as your specific baby goes.<br>  <br>  To see if it is teething, look at his gums. The tooth coming in will start looking like a little white blister.  Also, let him bite on your finger and feel for sharp edges.  If either of those things are going on, it probably _is_ teething.<br>  <br>  Here are some other signs of teething, but I think babies do all these things randomly for other reasons too.<br>  drooling enough to get a rash on the face<br>  increased night waking<br>  biting on things instead of sucking<br>  crying or pulling back when eating due to sore gums|`|2kY2BNNxaa	possibly. Maybe speak to your health visitor. Sure its nothing though.|`|AA10745032	no he is only 13 weeks old thats too early|`|xsH5aCYaaa	Yes those are some of the symptoms you should also watch out for fevers just give the baby a cool rag or ring and let them chew on it another sign is crying and pulling of the ears. These were the symptoms of all of my cousin's and there babies something that also works great for teething babies is some little chewable pills for the babies to them they taste great and one will do them the whole day. I think the name of it is little teether's. Just keep an out for some other symptoms. <br>  Good luck!|`|PFfABk30aa	13 weeks is not too young to start teething. I know this will sound crazy but my sister-in-law (13 years old now) was actually BORN with 2 teeth already! Some kids devolope at different rates everyone will tell you that. I think it sounds like teething but I'm not a professional just a mother of an 18 month old who also started teething around then. He's had it rough if you ask me. He started teething around 13 wks and didn't get his first tooth all the way until he was 15 MONTHS old. They all started coming in, you  could feel them along his gum line, they would even start to come out a little, but then stopped and another tooth started coming through. poor little guy. Now at 18 months old he has almost a full mouth of teeth!|`|rFRo6DGTaa	I think its teething, my daughter is 6 months and she had teething symptoms since 8 weeks, and she finally just got her first tooth last week, there poor gums get impacted by there baby teeth which could cause swelling of there gums, diarrhea, and fever.  I use to hold a cold washcloth in her mouth, and I give her teething tablets ( I love them, there a life saver).  I really don't think its odd for a 13 week baby to be teething early, our good friends baby boy had 2 teeth at 2 1/2 months.  so its definitely possible.  If you put your finger in his mouth (if he lets you) and he tries to bit on your finger then hes probably teething, and feel his gums to feel is there bumpy or smooth..good luck, hope he feels better soon!|`|kc26mQCBaa	if he isn't biting his blanket or fingers, or chewing a lot it probably isn't teething. Take his temperature, he may have a fever if he's whining. Give him a baby fever reducer and check it again. If the temp doesn't subside, take him to the doc right away. Do you breastfeed? You may have just eaten something that didn't sit well in his stomach. Good Luck!|`|RvZupQsXaa	sounds like your baby could be teething as its certainly not too young. My baby is 8 weeks old and has been teething for 3 weeks now all the symptoms you have but I can see a little tooth just under his gum down the bottom, I can rub  teething bonjela on his gums and also use calpol for 2 months +|`|SBNGkxfeaa	it could mean a lot of things, the most common thing for babies would be colic, i would consult a doc first though, they will know what it is :)|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Yup - this is teething! Arm yourself with drooling bibs, prepare to be bitten (watch out if you're breastfeeding!) and prepare for stinky, messy diapers! Ha Ha - the joys! You'll love your little one's new smile!

We started getting them for my daughter when she was about 6 months old and she is 4 now and still plays with them.  Also good for both boys and girls!  Not expensive either.  Good luck!

d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	The first 2 weeks are the hardest!  LOL  Once you get past those two weeks and you hear how much fun he is having and start receiving projects he did in class...you can't help but be proud and smile and know you made the right decision.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|t8SCvpgfaa	I know the feelings but always remember that your son getting older.|`|VwaFM0L8aa	It's always harder on the parent then it is on the child. Be strong don't let you child see you sad. Make sure you re insure him that this is a new fun thing and that he'll make so new friends.|`|2585e7e86671999b1b6f36975e39adf0aa	Well I'm glad to know I'm not the only parent out there that had this problem LOL.  What helped me was when I took her the first day and she ran right over to the toys and began playing and could care less that I was leaving...Okay well the first day that made me even more sad and I definatley cried all the way out to the car.  <br>  <br>  I do have some tips for you though.  Our preschool allows us to drop our preschooler off 15 minutes before class is to start, so they can have some "free play".  I always make sure that I get her there for that, she is like the 2nd or 3rd child at school.  Well one day we were running late and she didn't get there until over half of the class was there and oh my goodness it was not good she would not leave my side and cried for the first time.  And this was 3 months into the school year.  So as a rule we are to be one of the first children to school, I think all of the kids there was overwhelming for her.  <br>  <br>  Also I sign up for everything I can, field trips and class parties.  Our preschool also lets Mom's sign up to come in on Wednesday's.  Although I haven't done many of those due to having a baby at home and I just moved 100 miles away from all of my family so no sitter, but I do however go on all field trips and class parties.  They don't mind at all that "little sister" comes along, I just don't bring her during regular class as she would be more of a distraction.  Also to make me feel more secure with this we chose a private preschool as I feel that I can be involved as much as I want cause I pay for it monthly. <br>  <br>  Also when your child comes home and shows you all he is learning you will be so proud of yourself for doing what's best for your child!!!!!  My daughter is in her first year of preschool and can write her name, her sisters, mom and dad all by herself, also knows the letters a thru q in sign language so its great.  You'll be so happy you did it!  And you get a couple hours to spend alone or with other children if you have them<br>  <br>  Good luck and you'll be fine just cry it out (just don't let him see it )  :)|`|2z3lTB2Raa	I know its hard i remember last year when my son started it was so weird being home with out him,  but he loved it so much and learned so much that it made it soo worth it. You will get over this feeling it will just take some time.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	just don't send him. simple as that. the kid just turned 3 and you're already booting him off to school? most kids don't start pre-school until they're 4. sad.... ready to get rid of him already.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Are you sure you need to send him? Kids that age don't specifically need school in their lives; if you're home with him you can still do plenty of educational and fun things to prepare him for school, and he can get lots of socialization from the park, library programs for toddlers, community center classes, and playing with friends. Not saying you shouldn't send him, I'm just pointing out that not sending him is always an option when they're that young, as there is nothing they need from school that they can't get at home. Exception being the day care for working parents, of course.<br>  <br>  <br>  But if you  must, you must... my first child was in a private preschool from age two. She really enjoyed it, and my anxiety calmed down pretty quickly when she came home with a smile on her face and talked about how she loved her teacher or her friends, or brought home some craft projects to proudly display on the fridge.  <br>  <br>  No one is going to easy your concerns until after those first few days of giving it a go, unfortunately we just have to kind of try to keep a grip until then.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11109728	Oh gosh!  I know how you feel!  My daughter is 4, and this year has been her first at preschool.  It's not very hard for me, because she has always gone to a full time sitter (that's hard in and of itself though!), so her going to preschool has just been a change of routine.  The thing is, I feel the same way you do when I think about the fact that my daughter will be going ALL DAY to kindergarten this fall!  It's a lot different than being at the sitter's all day - I have the same worries you do, about them being more alone and taking care of themselves more.  The only thing you can really do is think about how great this will be as a new experience for him, and get excited about this new stage in his life!  It will be really good for him, and that will make you feel better when you know he likes it and looks forward to it.  He will have caring teachers and all of his new little friends there, he won't be as alone in preschool as you think he will be!
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Oh, there are so many great books to choose from!  (I assume you're supposed to bring a children's book for the parents to read to the baby.)<br>  <br>  "Goodnight Moon" is a classic.  We've read it so many nights to all of my kids.<br>  <br>  "Guess How Much I Love You" by Sam McBratney is another very sweet book.<br>  <br>  Two of my kids have loved "I'm a Little Caterpillar" by Tim Weare.  It has a caterpillar finger puppet going through the front of the book.<br>  <br>  Anything by Eric Carle is good, like "The Very Hungry Caterpillar".<br>  <br>  Or "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you See?" by Bill Martin, Jr.<br>  <br>  Sandra Boynton has some fabulous books, too -- "Barnyard Dance," "Hippos Go Berserk," and "Pajama Time" are three of our favorites.<br>  <br>  A few more ideas -- <br>  "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"<br>  "Dear Zoo"<br>  anything by Dr. Seuss|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	i tried this website www.peekastories.com they have a really good selections. and i like good night moon. franklin can tie hes shoes and Clifford the puppy. me and my rubber Dukie, and twinkle twinkle little star. old maid in the shoe and mother goose and the three little bears and red riding hood. and the ugly duckling. i hoped i have helped|`|qgglgTcRaa	Heyahhh,<br>  My cousin in like 2 months old and we bought my Auntie a book from amazon. (I could find out the name of the book if you email me:D) It was a book, ment for babies. They were all black and white the book is sort of card and Alex loves it he loves to sit and read it with his mum. It is black and white because babies are thought to only see in black and white. It has lots of famous pieces of art in and is very good! Hope this helped :D<br>  <br>  Elsie<br>  x
VMASMHX6aa	Knowledge is power. The simple act of taking one's temperature everyday can tell a woman a HUGE amount about what is going on with her body - as much as diagnostic medical texts.<br>  <br>  We aren't all passive, floating along the river of life, uncaring about our future. Having a child is the biggest change your life can possibly undergo and a massive responsibility. Why would someone be unbothered either way? That's the attitude that 13 year olds who get 15 year old's pregnant have!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I would have to disagree in the term "obsessed" with getting pregnant.  Getting pregnant takes GREAT dedication and perseverance.   It's the taking pregnancy tests that becomes the Obsession.<br>  <br>  I will agree with you on one thing though.  Yes, you are right.  When it will happen.  It will happen.  Why worry so much.|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	there is honestly no reason for you to be mean to the ttc ladies here. some of these ladies have been ttc for over a year-that is really difficult to do and deal with-nobody is obsessed-they are only trying really hard to have a baby,and why shouldnt they-They have every right,and who are you or anyone else to say any different. I would love to have a baby, and i feel now is the right time-i dont want to wait until i am 35, and then hey-what do you know it finally happened. Having a baby isnt always as easy as you think-there is a lot to keep in mind-if you plan to start a family you HAVE to do it right-check BBT,  buy OPK, and so on- why do some people obsess with studying? if its meant to be it will be, why do some people look for the love of their lives by going to dating sites etc-if its meant to happen it will happen, why does anyone try anything in life then?if its meant to it will???and i could go on. yes if it is meant to it will, but sometimes we just need to give mother nature, or out bodies a little nudge in the right direction-and you know why-BECAUSE WE CAN!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I can't speak for everyone else but my husband and I really wanted a child and it took over a year to get pregnant.  The first ended in miscarriage and now we have a beautiful little girl who will soon be 3.  After my miscarriage I became obsessed with getting pregnant again.  I guess it was my way of dealing with the loss.  I am now 17 weeks pregnant.|`|bKK2fPiVaa	That is an incredibly insensitive thing to say.  I worry because I want a family of my own!  I agree... it will happen in it's own time.  But no one is going to tell me NOT to take care of myself and understand the body cycles.<br>  I think women just hit that time in their life when they want a baby.  It's a hormonal thing.|`|JjBwydymaa	To be honest we are not obsessed.. we are hardworking dedicated people who want to start a family...<br>  <br>  Im taking it that you dont have children....because the day you do start wanting them... you may find that you will have some difficulty in conceiving. Its then that your turn to people for help and support and people who understand your emotions... People on Y/A are very good people to ask questions... It makes my TTC journey abit more fun and I can get some help and tips on TTC.<br>  <br>  Some people arnt as fortunate as others and have a very hard time of it... so stop with the ignorance because until you get to this point in your life you will not understand how we all feel!|`|m3oA5xLYaa	because TTC'ers are trying to get pregnant and knowing when you ovulate helps. I for one just BD for 2 weeks between, i have not gone the temperature path...I do believe it will happen when it is supposed to, but who is to say i can't help the process|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I never personally charted temps but I did chart my days, take my meds and use OPKs. Some people can't get pregnant on their own so no it just won't happen. I am happy I wasn't alone when it came to people on here. It made me feel good that other people knew what I was going through. My husband and I really wanted another child (we already have a 3 year old) and after 2 miscarriage I think we deserved a shot at it. I am now 14 weeks pregnant and if I had to do it again I would still be one of the overly obsessed charting maniacs! After 2 1/2 years of trying on our own I was Proud to be one of those people TTC!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Because they want to have a baby and so they need hope before they take the test. Its a bit dumb telling people not to worry unless you are in their shoes, some people wait a long time for their BFP so something that may seem 'silly' like monitoring your basal temperature is important to them.|`|yp9rEMSraa	You are so ignorant....Women who are TTC want a child and want it now....Yes they understand that if it will happen, it will happen but when you have been trying as long as some of these women have then it is hard not to obsess.....Maybe for you it took one time or you open your legs and boom you were prego...congrates for that but don't try and understand or think to understand what these women are going through...if you don't like it don't read the questions....these women have enough to deal with without having some ignorant person asking stupid questions like this....|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Because some people really want to start a family.

92cba129275175b5d95bd7b4c1334c6caa	I totally agree , My husbands little sister did  to keep her boyfriend around and things were fine for a month of her pregnancy... but then her BF left her she got all nutty about him and spent the remainder of it trying to get him back-the Baby was born two months early and never got the chance to breastfeed, now shes 8 months old and is WAY behind developmentally since she sits in front of the TV all day... also Mom isn't around since she was 4 months and so baby doesn't even know who she is and she weighs way more than she should because the Grandma feeds her Formula and sold foods but way overfeeds her! ....its so sad My husband and I have a little girl who was born 4 months after her and she is already doing things that this baby hasn't yet because I interact with her and encourage learning and growth.|`|vXYQcixvaa	I think it sometimes stems from them wanting attention. They think of the baby as a doll...something o dress cute and take to the mall with them! An accessory i guess. But i think the way to cure them of this want for a baby....is let them spend a few days...im talking 24-7 with a baby....let them see how they sometimes dont sleep when you want...they poop all over their clothes when your out to dinner....they cry during dinner so sometimes you cant eat....they need to be fed quite often.....these young girls dont ever really experience this stuff. Like i said.....showing them all that....thats the cure! And maybe a shopping trip to show them what they need to buy and how fast it adds up!<br>  <br>  ps: not to mention the negative attention she will also get...im a young mom (22) and people give me dirty looks all the time! I hate it! I cant wait for someone to say something so i can snap on their a$$ that im married and got preg afffter the wedding! LOL|`|YLXpwqceaa	My mother was one that could have raised kids at 15 (she had her first when she was 24), because she raised her 6 younger brothers and sisters (infants til now) so both her parents could work.  <br>  <br>  But most wont, and now a days, girls are getting pregnant left and right!  I saw a 12 year old concerned!<br>  <br>  I'm 22 years old so I know I'm on the younger side, but I didn't even think about sex at that age, nor a few years later!<br>  <br>  Girls are having sex younger and younger!|`|2n0B4cY6aa	because they are too immature at that age and still growing up and also have had no experience of newborns and raising kids thus not scared.<br>  Why is it okay for a 68 year old to have a kid, knowing she will be dead before kid is an adult!!|`|AA10500537	sometimes it cause they are not getting enough attention themselves and they think having a baby will give them something to love .|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I was thinking the other day that there are probably some 15 year olds who are mature and self-aware enough to raise a child.  But they are also the least likely to get pregnant, either by accident or on purpose.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I'm not getting the connection to the website, I couldn't find anything wehere it said anything about having a baby at 15, can you check the link.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	I think there might be a few possible explanations for this 'choice' to become a mother so young. Possibly, she is feeling lonely and unloved and needs someone to love. Possibly she is very immature. Possibly she has other mental health issues. Another likely a possibility is a hormonal imbalance. For women who have experienced the 'urge' to become a mom, it can be incredibly strong and without reason - those urges may not be a slave to age.<br>  <br>  I would hope those people in the lives of these girls are astute enough and caring enough to help them through it and get the medical attention they need, or the emotional support that they were lacking.<br>  <br>  Regardless, though, I disagree with your statement that you can't raise a baby at 15. It might not be the best possible situation, but, yes you can raise a baby at 15. It might not be easy, and it might be with supports, but it can be done and it can be done very well.<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  <br>  I just want to add that if a woman does this because of an off-kilter hormonal balance, removing that baby from her care could be detrimental. I think that's why it would be a good idea to know the motivation behind the pregnancy in such an instance - so baby and mommy can be helped.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	it's crazy expense!<br>  <br>  i'm 18 and pregnant with my first, my boyfriend and i are living together and we're going to make it work but it's not going to be easy...i'm fortunate enough to be finished with highschool and that my boyfriend has such a good job. sometimes i worry about how we're going to do some things for OURSELVES without being selfish parents...but sometimes you have to sacrifice and a 15 year old isn't going to want to sacrafice going to the mall and hanging out with their friends, spending their allowance on diapers instead of a movie or a new cd. <br>  <br>  it's scary ...but you can make it work...|`|OI3bf4yjaa	They are immature. They don't understand how hard it is to have and raise a child. Before they realize it, it's too late.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	It just goes to show the immaturity level of some 15 year old..

Lawyer up.|`|abubg2AXaa	I understand where you're coming from but think about it in the long run. Do you think she can change and be a better mother? Or do you feel she will remain the same? <br>  <br>  You should contact a social worker and see to it that your husband has full custody to the child. It will effect him more than any other person involved. You could also aquire a barring order to keep her away from him. If you don't want to do that then I suggest asking your husband about it. In the end, it is his son and he will know what's best for him.<br>  I hope I've helped|`|NHjFaeTLaa	TELL HER|`|08a714d3e35f7a5fcf99d16c6a42a486aa	It sounds like you are talking about my sister. No matter what you decide to do make sure you let your step-son know you are there for him. My neice finally got to the age where she realized her mother was a selfish sponge on society and she comes to me with all her concerns and problems now because she knows I care and will help her as best I can. The way she treats her son will only come back to haunt her when he grows up and starts seeing her without a child's eyes. I wouldn't confront her, that is your husband's place, she doesn't have to listen to you. I would tell my husband that he needs to talk to her because she's hurting his son. If she doesn't change after that then I would do like the other poster said and "Lawyer Up".|`|PJBjllsVaa	i don't think you should confront her just because it can cause issues to arise between your husband and her not to mention if you say something to her she will probably get mad and A. bad mouth you to the young boy and B. she will ignore you anyway<br>  sounds to me like she is a selfish good for nothing that doesn't deserve a child. if anything i would just make sure you and your husband have full custody and not let her see the boy anymore. when the boy wonders why his mother isn't around you should tell him the truth. it's not fair for you or your husband to have the child thinking it's your fault he doesn't see his mom when clearly that's not the case. the child has a right to know that his mother just isn't a mother in the true sense of the word.|`|c0plf0VLaa	Is there any way to do a custody battle to be able to prevent her from seeing him at all?

Good luck, she seems like a horror!!
9ro8fiKvaa	In your Aunt's case, no. If she's a 'young at heart', healthy Mom and is happy about it then she'll be just fine. Her Dr will advise her regarding any testing he/she feels necessary and if there are any risks involved, she'll be advised. She's already done this twice so she's probably better equipped than most people. She'll be fine - support her!|`|WbaSpiYpaa	No, I don't.  There are women out there 45 and older having children.  There are additional risks such as Down's Syndrome, but chances are everything will work out fine.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I don't think it's too old, but it's pushing it. There are a lot of risks for pregnant women over 35.|`|MtC3CWZraa	You're too old when your ovaries don't work anymore. The year of your birth isn't a factor.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	No, 41 is a great age for your aunt to have a baby.  She's probably smarter and more patient than she was when she had her older kids.  She will be offered more tests and more likely to be under the care of an OB instead of a family doctor or midwife, as there are greater health risks for her and greater risks of the baby having genetic problems, but overall women over 40 do well having babies.  Congratulations to your aunt!|`|hX7zhyIoaa	yes the child will not even be in high school and she will be 50.. how is she ment to take them out to the fair ground without saying ooh hang on kids i cant walk any further good luck though.. thata just my peronsal opinion xx|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Depend on every women.

Besides, if she takes care of her body and does everything she's supposed to--she will likely have a healthy baby regardless!|`|ncUhlwevaa	I don't believe she is too old to have a baby but her pregnancy will definitely be considered high risk due to her age. My mom got pregnant at 39 and they told her that a large percentage of babies born to an older mother have health problems.

8t8NjjnVaa	It's fine to sleep on your stomach.  Your baby is well-protected inside your womb and will not be crushed by you sleeping on your stomach.<br>  <br>  The only position that may possibly harm the baby is laying on your back (in later months).  Once the baby has grown a bit and your stomach has gotten big, laying on your back can put too much pressure on a vein (called the inferior vena cava) that can restrict blood supply.<br>  <br>  Usually, by the time your baby becomes so big that it would restrict blood supply, you wouldn't be comfortable on your back anyway.  As you get larger, the only way you will be able to sleep is on your side.  Stomach sleeping will no longer be comfortable either when you have a basketball hanging off your tummy!<br>  <br>  The absolute best way to sleep is on your left side.  Your liver is on the right side of your abdomen, so lying on your left side helps keep the uterus off that organ. Sleeping on the left side also improves circulation to the heart and allows for the best blood flow to the fetus, uterus, and kidneys. <br>  <br>  But until later in the pregnancy, you can sleep however you are comfortable.|`|rTACLd3Saa	My OB told me I could sleep on my stomach as long as it was comfortable for me.  I lasted about 6 or 7 months before it just got too uncomfortable for me.  Once you get bigger, down the road, it will actually be more dangerous for you to sleep on your back.  When the baby is bigger he will press on a big vein (I think it's on the left side of your uterus) when you lie on your back and it can cut off blood supply to the fetus.  I know that wasn't what you were asking but I thought I'd add that in.  Your OB will fill you in on all that later.  But for now, don't worry, you can sleep on your stomach without any problems.  There is so much natural fluid and cushioning around baby they won't even feel the difference.  Congrats on being pregnant!|`|dTPg4uYzaa	at 7-8 weeks you should be fine, your not hurting the baby. every one is diffrent and grow at diffrent rates/sizes by the time your big enough you will feel so uncomfortable sleeping on your stomach you wont want to anymore try sleeping on your side or with one of those bigg pillows see if that helps|`|fbguVOiQaa	I slept on my stomach while pregnant with both my children, the baby will be fine as its protected by lots of water in a big sack!<br>  if its how you are most comfortable then make the most of it! once you get a big belly, you won't be able too!<br>  Good luck with your pregnancy x|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i dont think it is! i mean if it is comfretable for you and you dont feel and pains or anything i dont see why not it is your body you will know !|`|TczFL0p0aa	i've always wondered this too.|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Volks is completely right!|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	I slept on my stomach for as long as I could with all 3 of my pregnancies and there were no problems-I was told by my midwife that as lnog as i was comfortable sleeping on my tummy, it was fine and that when it started to get uncomfortable, to remember not to sleep flat on my back.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/0,,midwife_4606,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a><br>   1. What position is best for sleep?<br>  Expecting moms should sleep and rest in whatever position they are the most comfortable.<br>  <br>  2. Are there exceptions to this rule?<br>  There are a few exceptions: If a mother is suffering from a high risk complication such as preeclampsia, preterm labor or placental insufficiency, which necessitates partial of full bedrest, then the best position for her would be side-lying. In addition, during labor, uterine contractions can cause fluctuations in uterine-placental blood flow. During this time, it is best for the mother to lie on her side. When the heavy uterus rests against the aorta -- and blood flow may be already compromised -- lying on one's back is not recommended.<br>  <br>  3. Is it safe to sleep on my back?<br>  During regular sleep intervals, it is fine for a mother to lie on her back. During the night, people frequently shift their positions, so it is unlikely that a mother would sleep the entire night flat on her back. Her bladder often necessitates one or more trips to the bathroom anyway!<br>  Learn More.<br>  <br>  4. How about sleeping on my belly?<br>  Even sleeping on your abdomen is quite safe in pregnancy. At some point, this will become uncomfortable. You may need to support an upper leg with pillows and lie more on your side after the beginning of the second trimester.<br>  Learn More.<br>  <br>  5. Are these positions really safe for my unborn baby?<br>  You should feel that any sleep position that is comfortable for you is fine during pregnancy. The human female body is uniquely prepared for such positions and they will not put the baby in jeopardy.|`|4CMQuJgOaa	you can sleep on your stomach...i am a stomach sleeper and slept on my stomach my whole pregnancy with my daughter and until i couldn't anymore with my son (gained 50lbs)<br>  <br>  unless your doctor tells you otherwise you will be fine and so will the baby|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	?

idTdPSvCaa	if the screw was really small then it is possible that you could have missed it but get her checked to be on the safe side,my daughter has been at  hospital and doctors for various reasons such as beads stuck up her nose and beads stuck in her ear that were never really there in the first place.as for the spots on her chin,nothing to worry about could be a result of teething if they annoy her try putting a little dab of tea tree oil on them or putting some toothpaste on them this will reduce redness and swelling will also soothe it slightly,hope this helps|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Take her to the doctors just to be sure. Its always better to be safe then sorry. Plus you'll worry about it till you do.
zK1V9Mu7aa	You'd be surprised, I was examined whilst in hospital because my waters may have broken.She checked how dilated I was at the same time which was only 1cm, so they told me I would have to stay in because I would have to be induced as there was 'no way I would go into labour naturally'. 2 hours later I was holding my son! (I wasn't induced) Joey's head was engaged for a couple of weeks though.<br>  Also, my friend had a midwife appointment, there the midwife told her that her daughters head wasn't engaged and she was 0cm, the midwife predicted that she would have to be induced - she gave birth 2 days later.<br>  Basically, as I'm saying is you'd be surprised how quickly your body will decide to get that baby out!<br>  If you want to try and encourage your babies head to engage, buy a big yoga ball and sit on it and sort of move back and forth and in circles. I have been told this helps get the baby in position. I was also told squats help, but don't do anything too vigorous as you don't want to injure yourself!<br>  Hope this has helped.<br>  X|`|HkImCOSuaa	you should just go ahead and get induced ask for cervadil i had it and it worked great the baby was out with in 15 hrs. or so..
o2QlBvfraa	Generally only one because the children are born close in age and so you would still have a lot of things from the previous birth.  Since I'm sure you've gotten rid of most of the items you will need, I don't see a problem with having another.  I agree that his family might be the best to throw this one, if not you, since your family is obviously opposed to it.  By all means invite both sides, but make sure to put on the invitation that gifts are not required, but always appreciated.|`|AA11327039	Maybe your new husband's family can have a shower for you, but etiquette states that the mom to be only gets one shower.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Its silly not to have a shower after 8 years!

His family should do it.|`|Vad64Jjoaa	I had 2 baby showers only because my kids are 10 years apart. If they were closer together I would have never needed one, but because they were so far apart I needed so many things for both of them. I am sure you did not keep everything for your little one from your first baby. Not to mention a lot of things are very out dated and could be potentially dangerous after 8 years. I think you deserve a baby shower for your new baby, your mother doesn't need to be the one throwing it. Do you have any friends that you could get together with and put together a shower? Point out to your mother that after 8 years the old baby things could be dangerous for your new baby now.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well it's proper to only have one baby shower. But I think each pregnancy should be celebrated, and not just the first one. It's okay to have another, but you have to find someone willing to throw one for you, and without making yourself sound greedy maybe you can have your husband bring up the idea to people. Tell him that you don't think your family is going to throw you a baby shower, and ask him if he can bring it up to either your own family or his, and see if someone will plan you one. I don't see anything wrong with having another baby shower... after waiting 8 years I'm sure you probably don't have any old baby stuff left over!|`|qitXGd0qaa	O.k. the one baby shower rule is based on the idea that women will be married and have all children with the same father and ideally 2 years apart, lol. In 21st century real life, that isn't always the case.<br>  <br>  Exceptions are now made for couples that have a large age gap between children, really who holds on to baby gear for 7-8 years? Couples that are having their first child together often have baby showers. Or even if you've had 3 sons with your husband and baby #4 is a girl, its not uncommon for you to get a baby shower with that pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The shower is to celebrate the birth of a new baby. If your mother is completely against throwing the shower, ask a close friend or maybe your husbands sister (if he has one) to be the host. If all else fails, host a "meet baby" type event a few weeks after the birth. You can still register for gifts but you just won't get the items until after birth.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? My mom's side of the family only believes in one. My dad's (which they are divorced and have been since i was one).. believes that EVERY baby should be celebrated, and have its own day (shower). So I had one with my 1st son, that included both sides and with my 2nd son, it was only my dad's side, except for my mom, she came. So it really just depends on the family and their traditions, I personally agree with my dad's side, that every baby is a gift and should be celebrated.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	thats just cold! i dont care if you have 100 babies you should have one for each the shower is a way to help you get the things for your baby! and your mom should know this! if she dont want to do it have someone else do it in your family that would be unfair to your baby he/she isnt  second class! and i am sure with the way things are now you can use every ounce of help you can get! so put your foot down and have your baby shower! and if your mom is so against it she dont have to come know it would be great if she did but this is about you!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Oh I see your mother must think only the first baby is important or special.... hmmm<br>  Every pregnancy and child birth is a miracle and a blessing.

53GH38Qiaa	That's your most fertile CM. You're most likely about to ovulate. Get to baby dancing!!!

Finally ovulated last night after 4 days of positive OPKS and EWCM. <br>  <br>  So get to baby dancing and go catch that eggie!!!|`|ESAM0U7xaa	it's suppose to be a sign of ovulating, but my last cycle i had that 4 days or so after my ovulation was over. so i've been a bit confused too ;)<br>  it's called egg white cm, so u can look it up online and read all about it!
ODosyM8zaa	CONGRATULATIONS!! This is a big step for both of you! Do twins run in your family? Yes fertility drugs help to higher the chance of having a multiple birth! However! My cousin and her husband were trying for just one more (they had two sets of twins already) and ended up getting 4 more! So yes it highers the chance of having a multiple birth but it can also leave you with more then twins! Lol. Ask your regular doctor if he/she knows any fertility doctors close to you. Good luck and baby dust!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Doctors won't start you on fertility meds if there is no medical reason you can't get pregnant...that is just idiotic.
vue9NOhYaa	All babies are different.  <br>  <br>  But ... rough average ---<br>  <br>  A newborn will usually nurse about 10-12 times a day for the first couple of months. (About every two hours, usually with 1,sometimes 2  slightly longer stretches (3-5 hours) at night.)<br>  <br>  After those first few months they usually continue to nurse about every 2- 2 1/2  hours during the day, but USUALLY begin going a bit  longer at night -- so 8-10 feeds are usual. A few babies are sleeping the night from 3-4 months, but that's not very common. <br>  <br>  A baby on solids (6 months+) will usually begin going a bit longer during the day (2-3 hours) , and usually begins sleeping all night (6-8 hours) -- so ... 6-8 feeds.<br>  <br>  Of course growth spurts, developmental leaps, teething, and so on will result in baby nursing more often from time to time.<br>  <br>  Babies take time.  However you feed the baby, she WILL need to eat often for those first 4-6 months or more, and breastfeeding is, honestly, more convenient than formula.  Nursing isn't 'work' ... you just latch the baby on and relax.  <br>  <br>  If you will be going back to work, yes, you can usually pump and have the caregiver offer pumped milk.  If pumping isn't possible, you can usually (esp. if you have several months of maternity leave) nurse while at home and have the caregiver offer formula.<br>  <br>  As for having daddy 'share in the parenting' .... remember that parenting isn't just about feeding.  Yes, you can certainly pump and have daddy offer bottles (preferably waiting 4-6 weeks to begin, to reduce the risk of nipple confusion and get your supply well established), but really, that just makes a lot of work for YOU.  There are many ways daddy can 'help' and 'share' ... baths and walks, and cuddles and songs and diapers.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Don't freak out! I think it all depends on how a mother chooses to go about nursing.<br>  When I had my first baby I was told that I needed to feed my baby every 3 hours no matter what. I was scared out of my whits that my child was literally going to starve to death if I wasn't exactly on time. I became cranky, sleep deprived and pretty much just like your sister in law. Then I started reading books that took a more natural approach to things (written by professionals of course) well my whole mothering experience turned around! I let baby tell me when he was hungry and we co-slept. I practised laying down and nursing so I could half-sleep for night time feedings. All I would have to do was latch him on and he would have a snack and fall back to sleep on his own. I do this with my second now (he's 6 months) and I have not lost one night of sleep at all. Also after you and your little one are comfortable with breast feeding you can pump to let you husband feed him. Not to early though because he could get nipple confusion.|`|x7vTKP24aa	my daughter is 5 months. she is eating every 3 hours still. it is tough at first but it gets easier. in the beginning it took at least half an hour to feed her, now were down to about 10 minutes. it does get easier, but if i were going to be working,and i had problems pumping, i would think about formula feeding as well as nursing. but i wouldnt just write off nursing completley|`|deIzFnV8aa	Well, they usually recommend you wake babies for feedings every 2-3 hours as long as they are under 8 lbs or until they get back to their birth wt. This normally takes about 2 weeks.  After that you would wait until they wake up from a nap or at night. It still works out to every 2 1/2 hours most the time with a few stretches of 4-5 hours (at night), for the first month.<br>  <br>  After the first month DD ate more like every 3-4 hours during the day, and twice at night (and "night" was about 12 hours long).  At 3 months she started not wanting to get up for the first night feeding, so now she eats at 7:30 pm, once sometimes during teh nigth (anywhere from 2-5 am) and again at 7:30 am.  Then every 3-4 hours during the day. <br>  <br>  One night feeding is typical up to 7-9 months.  This does not mean that baby will not sometimes (for whole weeks, sometimes) sleep the entire night  w/o needing to be fed.  Our DD slept 10 hours at a stretch for a week and a half when she was 3 months.  It varies very much by baby and by what is going on with baby (teething, growth spurts, etc)  Nursing every 3-4 hours during teh day is typical until baby starts taking  significant solids, also prob around 7-9 months.<br>  <br>  Many people pump and have husbands help out.  I had my husband give the first night feeding as soon as she was old enough to take a bottle w/o nipple confusion (drs usually say 3-4 weeks is a good time to introduce a bottle).   Needless to say, I thought this was a _wonderful_ way for him to help out :P<br>  <br>  Many people also pump and go back to work. If you are planning on doing so, you want to get a good, double electric pump so that it doesn't take all day to pump.  It takes a while to get started, but I know several people who pump enough for 3 bottles in 2 half-hour sessions while at work.  I also know several people who supplement with formula because they have a hard time pumping, but breast feed when at home (mornings, evenings).  Getting half-and-half breast milk and formula gives baby more nutritional value and helps baby digest much better than just formula alone, so if you should ever get discouraged with BFing, that is an option to consider.|`|yCwPxulYaa	I am still breastfeeding my (almost) 6 month old every 3 hours.  That is just how often she wants to eat.  Sometimes (like today) she has wanted to nurse every 2 hours.  I would like to tell you that they space it out as they get older, but sometimes they dont. <br>  <br>  I have never been good at getting much out with the pump.  I have pumped for 30 minutes before and only got one ounce out of both breast total.  But I know she gets plenty when she nurses.  She is a healthy 16 lbs 5 month old.<br>  <br>  But, it is so worth it.  I wouldnt trade it for the world even though it can be very trying at times.|`|T0gv52CDaa	My youngest son is 3 1/2 months old, and has been sleeping through the night since a little before he turned 2 months old.  My oldest son (now 2 1/2 years old) didn't sleep through the night until he was about 4 months.  That really varies a lot by child. If you are going to be going back to work, whatever you pump, you are going to want to freeze and save for when you are not around.  There are some women who can pump a lot and often, and if you are lucky enough to be one of them, then letting your husband take one night time feeding will be fine.  However, if you are like me, and can just barely pump enough to get your child through the next day, then your husband helping out with feeding will have to wait until you start introducing solid foods.  Also, breast milk works on a supply and demand basis.  The more you nurse, the more you produce, and the more you are able to pump.<br>  <br>  As for your husband wanting to help in the parenting, there is more to that than just feeding.  My husband helps in the parenting a lot. He plays with our kids all the time, he gives baths, he changes diapers, he talks to them and takes them for walks.  He just can't feed them  until they start on solid food.  Now that I'm back to work, my husband is taking his 12 weeks of FMLA which will last until the end of the school year when I'm out of work for the summer, so he is finally getting to use all of the milk I've been storing in the freezer and help out in feeding too, but he has always been very involved in the parenting of both of our children, and your husband can be too, just not in the feeding.  Of course if you are not going back to work, and are just pumping for those times when you either need a break or are going out, then by all means, let your husband have one of the late night feedings.<br>  <br>  As for your sis-in-law, don't scare yourself because of her experience.  Just as every baby is different, so is every mother.  You may find that the lack of sleep doesn't bother you as much as you think it will, or you may be like me and learn to sleep while nursing.  Before my son started sleeping through the night, I would wake up, attach him to a breast, and fall asleep sitting up.  If when I woke back up, he was still nursing, I would switch him to the other breast, and if he had fallen asleep too, I would put him back in his bassinet, and go back to bed myself, so I very rarely felt sleep deprived.|`|4Kf3GtBjaa	all babies are different i have a two month old daughter and i'm breastfeeding her. i am very happy to let you know that she is no trouble at all. she sometimes eats every 3 to 4hours but at night she lets me sleep around 7 to 8 hours and she has been doing this since birth.  so don't stress yourself right now, when your baby is born you and your husband will be able to accommodate fine. and i'm sure that pumping will help you a lot too because with my first daughter (she's 3 now) I had to pump because i still had to go to school, and she and i did fine.  i hope everything turns out good for you and good luck.  remember not to stress about it a lot right now. just try to enjoy your pregnancy months!|`|AA10167940	Babies should be fed on demand whether you breast or bottle feed.<br>  <br>  My 9 month old nurses about every 4-5 hours along with 3 meals and 2 snacks a day-
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_832.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_832.html</a><br>  Many parents fear that fevers will cause brain damage. Brain damage from a fever will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6 degrees F (42C) for an extended period of time. Many also fear that untreated fevers will keep going higher and higher, up to 107 degrees F or even more. Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105 degrees unless the child is overdressed or trapped in a hot place. The brain's thermostat will stop the fever from climbing above 106 degrees F. Some parents fear that fevers will cause seizures. For the great majority of children this is not the case. About 4% of children, though, will sometimes have seizures with fever. These febrile seizures are caused by rapid increase in temperature, not by the height of the temperature. Once a child already has a high fever, a febrile seizure is unlikely with the current illness. In any event, febrile seizures are over in moments with no lasting consequences. Treating fevers early in these children may prevent further febrile seizures. Antiseizure medications are only considered if the child has frequent febrile seizures – especially if they do not respond to acetaminophen or ibuprofen (Pediatrics in Review, November 2007).<br>  <br>  So, what temperature constitutes a fever?<br>  <br>  While 98.6 degrees F is considered the normal core body temperature, this value varies between individuals and throughout the day. The daily variation is minimal in children less than six months of age, about 1 degree in children 6 months to 2 years old, and gradually increases to 2 degrees per day by age six. A person's baseline temperature is usually highest in the evening. Body temperature, especially in children, is normally raised by physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, elevated room temperature, and elevated humidity. A rectal temperature up to 100.4 degrees F (38C) may be entirely normal (no fever). A rectal temperature of 100.5 or above should be considered a fever. Lower values might be a fever, depending on the child.<br>  <br>  A fever does not necessarily need to be treated. If a child is playful and comfortable, drinking plenty of fluids, and able to sleep, fever treatment is not likely to be helpful. Steps should be taken to lower a fever if the child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dehydrated, or having difficulty sleeping. The goal is to bring the temperature between about 100 and 102 degrees F -- not to eliminate the fever.<br>  <br>  When trying to reduce a fever, first remove excess clothing or blankets. The environment should be comfortably cool (one layer of light weight clothing, and one lightweight blanket to sleep). Two medicines are useful for reducing fever in children: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Children's Advil or Motrin). Acetaminophen is given every 4-6 hours, and works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Don't use under three months of age without first having the child examined by a physician. Ibuprofen is given every 6-8 hours, and helps fight the inflammation at the source of the fever. It is not approved for children under 6 months. Both medicines may be given for stubborn fevers, but be very careful about using the correct dose of each.<br>  <br>  A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a febrile child (after medication is given -- otherwise the temperature bounces right back up). Cold baths or alcohol rubs cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.|`|PFfABk30aa	on some information pamplets I recieved from a hospital when my son was sick it stated what research has shown the following to-do's and not-to-do's.<br>  DO NOT:<br>  *wrap her in blankets, heavy clothing, etc<br>  *alcohol baths, cold/ice baths<br>  DO:<br>  *keep her in something breathable that if she is feeling feverish it will keep her cool but also warmish if she starts getting chills as most people do with a fever that is persistant<br>  *you can alternate tylenol and motrin/ibprofen like this:<br>  Tylenol at 2pm, motrin at 4pm, tylenol at 6pm. so that you're giving her tylenol every 4 hours and in between your giving her motrin every 4 hours--do not give the same medicine more than once every 4 hours and do not give tylenol and other at the same time!<br>  *you can give her a 'cool' bath. something a little less than warm<br>  *keep the house cooler so she isn't so hot<br>  it also stated that if the fever persisted for 48-72 hours you should consult your physician again.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	No don't wrap her in any blankets, that will just make her temp stay high or go higher. Maybe use a light blanket or sheet if anything. Give her a lukewarm bath to help keep the temperature down. Give her plenty of liquids too, you don't want her to become dehydrated. Unfortunately, you are going to have to wait, until the fever breaks. If you are still worried, then do what you need to do as a parent and take her to the hospital and forget what the doctor told you, she is your child not theirs. Hope she gets better soon. Hope this helps.|`|irHF6CBPaa	No don't wrap her in blankets that will make the fever worst put a damp cloth in her forehead and in her tummy keep her with loose clothing and don't cover her up with a heavy blanket just a sheet she will probably be cold but if you wrap her all up it will make the fever go higher keep giving her the Amoxil as prec. if she does not get better by tomorrow talk to your Dr<br>  <br>  <br>  I forgot how old is she? What is her temp?|`|jgDlkSiWaa	Wipe her with a cool cloth. <br>  You can try a warm (not hot or cold) bath if the dr says it's okay. <br>  Feed her things that are cool (popsicles, ice chips if old enough) cold bottles or milk.<br>  how old is the baby? What is the temp?|`|AA10594067	My son, 13 months, had a 105 temp for 2 days.  We went to the doctor and she told us to alternate tylenol and motrin every 2 hours.  We gave him a luke warm bath and pedialyte to drink.  NO DAIRY!  Just keep a check on her.  See if the temp goes down and back up or just stays up.  If it goes any higher, call your doctor or go to the emergency room.  Best of luck!|`|X6as2nOAaa	I wouldn't wrap here because if they get so hot it can sometimes cause a seizure don't want to freak you out but im just telling you, if it doesn't go down then I would call the doc again and tell them.

d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Why stop playing to go on the potty when you can simply go in your pants??  LOL This is their train of thought...I've had to ecourage my daughter to stop playing and sit on the potty.  I had to reassure her that her toys would still be there and as soon as she was done going potty, she could continue playing.  She would/will insist at times she does not need to go but if she has had anything to eat or drink in the past hour...I know she's not necessarily being honest about that.  Sometimes they need help with that part...we know our limits...how long we can last until we HAVE to hit the potty but they still don't understand their bodies to THAT point yet.<br>  <br>  How I encourage her to go on the potty without forcing her...I tell her that I need to go but don't want to go by myself and ask her to come with me and read me a story.  When we get into her bathroom, I'll start to remove her potty seat so I can sit down on the potty and she'll push me aside and insist it's her turn first and tell me to sit on the edge of the tub.  She'll sit down on the potty with the book and sometimes as she's making up the story she'll relax and go...other times, I'll push it along by running the bathwater for about 30 seconds and then she starts going LOL.  <br>  <br>  Rewards and great enthusiasm are BIG helpers as well.  My daughter is always so proud of herself when she goes on the potty...she HAS to tell everyone (and what she did LOL).  And yeah not everyone needs to know but...if it helps her to stay excited about going on the potty and keeps her going then by all means I will be just as excited as she is about it LOL. I usually give her stickers or bubbles but recently we created a Treat Bucket using her Halloween bucket and there is candy, bubbles, stickers, and some little toys in there and we let her pick ONE treat from the bucket after she goes.  She gets soo excited and dances when she sees that bucket coming her way LOL. <br>  <br>  Don't get too frustrated...try to stay positive, she'll get the hang of it in her own comfort and time but definitely try some new things out...maybe you'll find a gimmick that will work for her too!  Good luck!|`|UR9BX77haa	Reward chat - and really go into it with stickers and lots of praise, make your life all about the toilet for the next few weeks but in a fun way. <br>  Our daugher is fully toilet trained and has been for almost 3 months by using this method, we did start at 17 months and it all went wrong she would not go near her potty so just after her second birthday we tried the reward chart, it was on the wall near her potty and  we gave 1 sticker for a wee, 5 stickers for a poo, we promised she could choose a toy from ELC (her fav shop) as soon as she filled it with stickers. We were very consistent in asking if she needed the potty and encouraged her to pull her own nappy down, everytime she did something herself we applauded her.She filled the chart in 2 weeks and was telling us she needed to go.We then let her choose a pack of big girl knickers and threw every nappy away.Now she has 100% control and we don't even have to ask her, she just toddles off to the toilet & pops her seat on. <br>  So don't get frustrated, just keep going with the praise and make the toilet such a big girl thing to do.|`|zKWYkvHkaa	well. if she uses a potty chair everytime she goes in it you should let her pick out a sticker to put on it:) and if she doesnt she might just be kinda scared of the regular toilet and maybe you should buy her a potty chair or a toilet cover.|`|xwOwsZvEaa	rewards are a great idea, kids want to go just to get tyhe reward and b4 u no it they forget about the reward and they r clean. yeeeaaa|`|2nKe3j84aa	*Don't make an issue of her using the potty.<br>  *Offer rewards for using it.<br>  *Get rid of the training pants and give her 'big girl knickers' instead she might feel different about not wanting to poo in those!<br>  *Try toileting her every hour to minimise the risk of accidents<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nFsg9KEVaa	if she has a doll of a toy she like allot you could try showing her that the toy/doll uses the potty as well.|`|XxZQ72J4aa	I remember being potty trained, and this might sound ridiculous, but my parents would sing me a song about how great it was that I used the potty. Just keep encouraging her and reward the good behavior. :)|`|1e3gBZY9aa	Keep encouraging her. When she does use the potty, tell her what a good job she's doing. Don't make her feel bad when she doesn't use the potty. Try to tell her how important it is to learn to use the Big Girl Potty. Just be patient. When she's ready, she'll use it. Just don't push her too hard.
tOItOSZHaa	indeed many prefer oil based trim believing its durability surpasses water based paints , that not so much a case against quality water based paint from professional paint stores , less than a hour of painting i would have no concern just dont 're'expose your self to the fumes. like if i was painting oil trim i would do ,say one door casing or window then step away to work in another area after about 10 minutes i believe 50% of the fumes have dissipated then i would return to the bath to do another casing/baseboard  or door face  etc..now days i only recommend oil for things like security doors gutters iron fences mainly stuff cast in metals and have someone take the baby while painting water based or not , 2 of 3 of my children had asthma while very young and some times i believe coming home from work after painting exposed them to the chemicals i used , now i only paint for friends or family and im the only one with asthma issues now|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's best to call and ask your doctor.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	no dr would recommend anything with strong fumes during pregnancy and although some are not clinically shown to cause fetal harm why would you risk it? there are so many chemicals in everything these days ive stayed away from any kind of paint and even most cleaning products. its just not worth the risk. call the dr. the baby is probably fine but i wouldnt do it again
113FoyMFaa	don't call yourself "a mother to his baby".<br>  <br>  Honey, every new gf will talk smack about the old one.   So we can't believe everything you say about her.<br>  <br>  Another thing, babysitting gives you NO WERE near the experience it takes to be a mother.  He may want you to be the mother, but that's tough titties.  He had sex with someone ELSE and made this baby.<br>  <br>  My ex turned into an alcoholic.  Of course, I wanted a new male influence in my kids lives.  It's not that easy.  Even with a douche bag like him, it cost thousands and thousands of dollars to keep full custody<br>  <br>  It is NOT all sunshine and rainbows ahead.  You want to be this babys mother one day?

First off, and most importantly, you are NOT the mother to that 7 month old you've been looking after.  I've seen some of your previous posts, and if this is the same child you're alluding to, I must stress again that he is not your 7 month old.  I know it's new and fun to pretend and fantasize that he is, and it may feel as though you are if you're taking care of him often, but this is not reality.  You have no biological or legal ties to the boy, and while you may feel affection toward him, this does not make you his mother.  If you are staying in and foregoing other activities that any other 17 year old would enjoy, then you need to step back and look at the bigger picture.  The fact that you would even consider something as ridiculous as dropping out of school to care for SOMEONE ELSE'S kid is beyond me.  Run, run from this (new) relationship fast.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  If you know that this child is being abused, the mature and responsible thing to do is to notify the authorities.  You may think you know what you are doing, but I suspect you aren't quite thinking this through, and are letting your heart guide, rather than your head.  What you shouldn't do, in my opinion, is step in and complicate an already complicated situation.  You have such an opportunity- you can get out fairly cleanly now and chalk it up to a near-miss, or you could stay and have a very difficult time of it.  It really is up to you, and part of being an adult is making these life-changing decisions.  Good luck, and again, please don't become complacent about abuse and get that baby the help he needs.<br>  PS-  As mentioned, babysitting experience does, in no way, prepare you for (actual) motherhood.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	First off, you aren't the mother to this baby, so it is not your responsibility to make sacrifices,  (such as dropping out of school) to help support or care for this baby.   <br>  <br>  If you plan on continuing to date this boy, then being apart of this babies life is fine and actually appropriate to a degree.  You do not and should not neglect school, work, or your own time for a child that isn't yours.  You are young, only 17, and you don't even know if you and this guy are going to stay together.  Loosing your high school education over this would be a very immature decision.  <br>  <br>  I think spending time with your boyfriend and the baby, changing a diaper here and there, and playing with the baby would more then enough help considering you are not the one who had the baby.  It is not your responsibility to take care of this baby.  <br>  <br>  * Please have safe sex*   (This is my motherly instinct kicking in here telling you to have safe sex!)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You are not this baby's mother.  You can certainly be a warm, welcoming influence on the child.  But don't let his mistakes become your own simply because you are dating him.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	First you need to drop the mentality of 'I enjoy being a mother to his 7 month old baby' You are NOT this babies mother and you NEVER will be this babies mother. You are NOT being a mother you are being 'extended family' you can babysit, you can take care of, you can buy things for the baby but at the end of the day you give the baby back to their parents. YOU are not raising this child.<br>  <br>  Second, I don't think it's going to last. You two are obviously at different points in your lives. Your going to go off to college soon while he's sending his own child to pre-school. You can try if you want, but don't expect it to be easy, and relationships are hard enough you've got a clusterf*ck of complications.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Oh hunny, he is only a boyfriend and you aren't the mother. It would be a huge mistake that you will regret for the rest of your life if you drop out of school. This is his baby, so he is the one who needs to be making the sacrifices, not you. Don't cut your life short. You have all the opportunities in the world ahead of you.|`|FmC1TGm5aa	Listen to Your Own advice:<br>  <br>  "Seriously Worry about school and not sex! Older men Back off of the young girls or go to Jail!. desperate? Go look at porn. Us young girls need to worry about school and not sex and kids. We should wait till we are 21+ with a man close to our age!"<br>  <br>  You posted this earlier on YA, and it's true. Why are you back-tracking now?|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well I think you need to stay in school and realise that you are only 17 and you are not the mother to this baby. You can be there that would be fine as long as you stay in school.|`|5DJcir9saa	2 things...you're young and in a new relationship so please don't say that you enjoy being a mother to HIS baby...it sounds like you're trying to take the mother's place.  At this point all you can do is encourage him to bond and spend as much to with his baby as possible.  That means if he has to choose between hanging out with you or taking care of the baby, don't be upset when he chooses the baby.  Just be supportive.  He is going through a major life change and his baby needs his full attention right now.|`|AA10041941	first off I don't really understand what your asking, but if its if you should drop out of school to become the mother to your boyfriends baby then DON'T! because for 1 your NOT the babies mother.. and for 2 your just 17...finish school go to college and think about these things when your old enough to provide for you own kids when your ready to have them, not because some dude swept you off your feet..  your young yet and you will have plenty of time to grow in other relationships..besides how in the world could you possibly know if this relationship will even last? sounds like to me he isn't that great of a guy but for whatever reason it didn't work out with the previous girl you should really just focus on your studies and your life and leave him and his baby, and baby mama outta the mix..this is NOT gonna be a pretty situation and you need to not deal with it, your too young to even understand the scope of it. I wish you well, good luck!|`|EXhVHMAlaa	It's very good that you don't want to drop out.<br>  You can still be a great girlfriend while in school.<br>  I would NOT call yourself a mother to this child yet.<br>  If you and your boyfriend would ever end your relationship it would be hard for the child.<br>  Wait until you are married to call yourself a mother to this child.<br>  Get a great education to help yourself and future family.<br>  God bless.|`|dgRTkccBaa	You have to remember that you're not this baby's mother.  It's nice that you want to help him care for the baby and be supportive to him, but if in the future you break up you will not have any rights to the child.  Hopefully things will work out for you, but you should keep a certain distance because getting too attached could make a breakup that much more painful for you.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Ok, to the people who are slamming this girl...let it go. Things happen! If i ever happened to break off from my partner i would be another single mom at 18. <br>  I wouldnt want anybody to judge my new relationship or me just because i had a baby!! Thats not right and unfair, this guy might not be all that bad and there is nothing wrong with that.<br>  Stop preaching....<br>  <br>  Anyways...stop calling yourself a mother. Your not his mom so dont, your his daddys girlfriend so dont get confused. If it were me i would be getting pissed at some girl calling themselves that with my daughter. <br>  I think if the relationship is going well and the baby is the main conecrn of both of you then there is no harm in this.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.|`|zATQaiwIaa	first off - i woudnt call yourself a mother to his baby.  Im sure that would really piss of the actual mother.  I dont understand what you want an opiniion on here for though.  So your bf has a baby with another girl - your 17 and in school......<br>  <br>  My opinion is you are still young and should concentrate on finishing high school and your future - with or with out the current bf|`|E5CnUdhsaa	you are not the mother and never will be. that baby will not see you as a parent as it already has to you bf and his ex. concentrate on your education instead of playing mom to someone elses child. you have no responsibility over this child except morally.|`|K0k9vGsHaa	Your shits fucked up.
Rf9eWfCvaa	I like Amber for a girl and Jasper for a boy. You have some nice names! One of my fave names are Emma Rose. Hope this help you decide!|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I love Michael/Mike as the middle name, family is so important!!  & what a way to honour both men.<br>  <br>  I love Cade, and Reese.<br>  <br>  Amber and Leah are nice.  Allison?|`|bIaywrBCaa	Cade and Dahlia are great names and go well together!|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	I like all of your boy names, especially Haydon, Drew and Cade I would definitely use Mike if you would like to honour both of your Dads. However, I would maybe use Mike as a middle name so its not too confusing. As for the girls names I love them all except I'm not a big fan of Dahlia. <br>  <br>  My favs of both lists would be Haydon and Allison. Some of my fav boys and girls names are Nathan, Aidan, Oliver, Caleb, Madeleine, Erin, Christen and Isabelle. <br>  <br>  Make sure that the name you choose is what you absolutley love -- not what others think is best. It is good to get others opinion but it should ultimatley be your (and your boyfriend's) decision because it is your child.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I love Dahlia. :) It's a perfect name. I like Dahlia Amber and Dahlia Jade from your name choices. Other names I would suggest are:<br>  <br>  Dahlia Maren<br>  Dahlia Anne<br>  Dahlia Kirsten<br>  Dahlia Brynn<br>  <br>  Of your boys' names, I like Hayden Michael.

Are your periods usually dead on time?   <br>  <br>  I reckon you may have got a false negative in your test (it happens)|`|WljG2gXsaa	Thank you for the key to the abbreviations. I wouldn't be able to answer without them lol. I think there's a possibility you could be. Those are definitely signs but maybe your HCG levels aren't high enough yet and that's what make a test positive. You should wait a week to test again if BFN you should see your doctor so he or she could do a blood test that should tell you for sure if you are. Hope i helped.|`|AA11977483	Hi hunni,i have read all ure questions and it sounds like you could be pregnant,but you could go docs and get blood test done as i would have thought the pregnancy tests would have picked up hcg by now,but everyone different.I hope you get ure bfp soon.xx|`|jtvFoIfhaa	there is a chance, take anouther test
nFW8QeBsaa	I am 25 and pregnant with my 3rd child and have a very good job went to college and the whole nine but it still isn't enough. Without a degree your only going to be able to work at a fast food rest. making $7 an hour. That is not nearly enough to take care of a baby. Just to give you a idea of what to expect. My youngest is 2, I pay $528 a month for daycare now. When he was a baby I had to pay extra for a special formula because he was lactose intolerant so I paid $28 a can every 3 days, $14 a pack of diapers every week and not to include how fast they grow out of their clothes. I would really weight out all the expense if I were you. And besides you have your whole life to have kids, you will ot even be able to hang out with friends and live a normal teenage life, my advice get on the IUD....|`|0JHqXKciaa	I hated school too but DO NOT drop out and have a baby right now.  No matter how in love you might be with your boyfriend right now the odds of you staying together for the rest of your lives is very low.  With out an education you are going to have nothing.  How do you plan on raising a baby with no money?  Daycare is at least $500 dollars a month.  Babies go through probably a package of diapers (40count)every week and a half.  Formula is about 20 dollars a can or about 130 by the case.  How are you going to provide clothing?  Where will you live?  Do you have health insurance?  You will need to have a doctors visit for you baby at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age and you will need to get her immunizations.  Do you have a car to get around with your baby?<br>  <br>  Your a kid act like one.  It would be completely irresponsible not to mention plain stupid to have a child at that age.  You should be living your life, having fun with you friends and your boyfriend.  When you have a child your life comes second.  Get through high school and maybe get certified to become a medical or dental assistant they make decent money and it doesn't require al ot of schooling.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	a GED is not the same as a diploma and my sister-in-law is having a hard time getting a college to except her with a GED and not a high school diploma. You may not want that now but you may want it later so don't quit school to get pregnant. Personally 5 months of being together is not a relationship. I don't want to be one of those people who tell you that you are wrong and stupid cause I think everyone has an opinion but I think you really should wait a couple years before you have a baby. I was 20 and married when I got pregnant and wow it was a complete change. Think about what you should be doing before making a very big decision that can permanately alter your life.|`|hpJdK2ULaa	ok so look i thought the same way when i was 16, my thing is i dropped out of school ran away with the guy, well not saying things will turn out for you the way they did with me (which i am 20 now) but the guy i ran away with turned out to be an abuser, glad i did that! well i left him, moved across the country...now i will say things got better, but i ended up getting pregnant, by another man at only 17, and things were hard. i did get my GED, graduated in the top 5% of all GED graduates in the state, once again not saying things will work the same way, i am very lucky that i have been married for two years and have a gorgous baby boy and am making a good living, so please listen, if there was one thing i could change in my life.....<br>  <br>  <br>  IT WOULD BE TO HAVE STAYED IN SCHOOL BEFORE STARTING A FAMILY, BE SMART DONT THROW LIFE AWAY, I DONT REGRET MY SON FOR ANYTHING, BUT HE COULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL AFTER SCHOOL>|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I have to agree with both of the answers, especially the first one. A GED (or OSSD where I come from) is pretty much useless, it's not really a diploma. It's only a "ticket" to get into post-secondary education (college). <br>  <br>  Having a baby just to get out of school is pretty stupid! Listen to what your gut is saying! If something is telling you "it's a stupid idea," you are most likely correct.<br>  <br>  Just try your best in school, find a career that you love doing, and aim for that instead. Much healthier!|`|zdGpaFlfaa	getting ur GED is harder than u think. u have to go to night schoo and the teachers dont teach they r their to supervise thats all. u have to teach ur self. so id stay in school if i were u.|`|rjVALevtaa	Well, high school does suck but pregnancy is not a good way to get out of it! If you would rather get your GED, talk to your parents, maybe they will let you.<br>  <br>  Having a child at 16 is extremely difficult. I went through it and I can tell you that it isn't easy. <br>  <br>  Wouldn't you rather enjoy your time being a teenager? Why do you want to take on such a responsibility now?<br>  <br>  Having a child means giving up a lot of freedom. I say you should enjoy your youth while you still have it. You have the rest of your life to have children, why start now?|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	School lasts for only hours a day. Parenthood is a never ending 24/7 life sentence. I cannot believe that you would trade an 8 hr commitment for a lifetime responsibility. Please do not get pregnant. If you want out of school so badly, then arrange to take your GED. No one says you have to be a single parent to do that.<br>  <br>  Why do you hate school? Because you have to wake up too early? Because teachers are unreasonable and make you do assignments you don't want to do? Because people disrespect you? Babies do all these things and more.|`|zATQaiwIaa	I think your own feelings answered your own question in all honesty....<br>  <br>  So you hate school - big whoop.  Dont get pregnant just bc you hate school.  and as long as 5 months with your boyfriend may seem to you - you both still have a lot to learn about each other.  <br>  <br>  If you hate school that much - then just drop out and get your GED that way.  And i am in no way saying you should - I believe you should stay in school....but having a baby is NOT the answer!|`|f98093c5efc4ff7a072f987cac7a9d42aa	Your feelings are correct. You are stupid for actually wanting to be pregnant at 16. At your age, you can't possible fully understand how difficult raising a child can be.|`|ZDC81VjZaa	I wouldn't say you're stupid but to be pregnant at 16 just to get out of school... and with someone who you've only known 5 months... I'd say you're very foolish and have much learning and growing to do.<br>  <br>    So, you're smart enough to get a GED.  Then you're smart enough to stay in school and finish it out til the end.  If a baby comes along, you'll find excuses to never obtain your GED and then what?<br>  <br>    And how can you be certain this young man feels as you do?  Maybe HE isn't ready to be a dad, yet.  If you did discuss this with him and he's told you matter of factly that he doesn't desire a child at this time... it's very much entrapment if you go ahead and intentionally get pregnant, anyway.<br>  <br>    You're 16.  You've got a few years left before you're an adult the rest of your entire life.  Don't rush into parenthood just because a baby would seem convenient for you to get out of school.  You're talking about the possibility of another human life... don't make a baby for selfish reasons.  Wait til you're older and have had some life experience or you'll find yourself very disappointed.  <br>  <br>    I recommend you wait.  Besides... at 16 years, you're body has a bit of developing to do still.  Also, I personally don't feel you are mature enough to be a mother at this time... based on your reason for wanting one.<br>  <br>    Think it out.  Lives will certainly be affected by your foolishness if you don't.|`|uZTLlAH9aa	NO.<br>  DO. NOT. DO. IT.<br>  <br>  You will REGRET it. Of course you hate school. Doesn't everybody? But a baby isn't the way out of it. Only 80% of guys stay with their girlfriend's after a baby. You are way too young and have a life ahead of you. Contrary to what people think, a GED is NOT the same as a diploma.|`|oyINZiNDaa	don do it we've got enough unprepared teen mothers an people livin off the government but sorry i only make so much money an id like to keep it im tired of taxes goin up to pay for your wic an foodstamps to pay for other peoples babies ****...ya dig...wait..an the GED test is pretty hard...there was **** on there that i never learned in highschool an i went til my junior year.....but do wat ya do...|`|oQDQSSSDaa	Silly. Wait till you're out of school, college everything basically. And have a good stable job and a loving husband, rethink your question then. Don't even think about having a baby right now, it's only just your hormones thinking that way.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	You raise serious doubts in my mind that you can get a GED based solely on how terrible that plan is.<br>  <br>  A GED doesn't get you food. It doesn't guarantee you a job.

ENANtueuaa	I don't think she had ADD or ADHD, because she is fine in school. This question is kinda tough, because i'm not a doctor lol...but my sister had OCD as a child, and she did a lot of the things you mentioned. OCD is obsessive compulsive disorder. OCD in a child has alot of the same symptoms ADD has. They actually thought my sister had ADD for the longest time before finally diagnosing her correctly. My parents where against medicine, because they didn't want anything altering her mind. She eventually grew out of it. Then again, there could be nothing wrong at all! She might just have some extra energy because she's so good at school. My daughter is 5 and the same way in school, but when she comes home, she has all this extra energy. I'd rather have it that way, then her being bad in school. If you are really concerned, take her to a child psycologist, the one that doesn't deal with medicine. She can find out if your daughter actually has something wrong, and if she does she can provide "non medicine" ways to help her. Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT: My sister used to have to touch things also, and if she wasn't allowed to or couldn't for some reason, that would lead to a fit of crying and even confusion. I think she had fits because she didn't know how to deal with how she felt. I'm 13 years older than her, so i remember all this pretty clearly. Hope some of this helps!|`|AA11784984	Sounds like i could possible be it. My son said the same thing about his brain not being able to shut off. We use meds but seeing that you don't want to do that you can actually try giving her caffeine. For children with add it sometimes has the opposite effect on them.|`|f1nX6thdaa	She actually says, at 5 years old, her brain wont let her rest??  I think that out of everything you said, one thing stand out in my mind...That in preschool, she is exceptional. Never acting out.  That means that she's very capable of maintaining that behavior at home as well as at school.  Even at preschool, she can't be constantly engrossed.  <br>  As for ADD or ADHD, I don't know enough about either one to form an opinion.  Some times we are blessed with excepional children, ones that require a little more attention then the next!  If I were you I'd explain this to her pediatrician and take what they have to say to heart, but dive into reading and other peoples testimonials before you form or come to a decision on how you will address this issue!!
sqaey2Siaa	I don't feel any remose for the guy ...what guy grabs a girls butt under her skirt and thinks he has the right to get away with such a thing. Your sister was right in defending herself, I'm sure she didn't mean to rupture his testicles on purpose, but sh*t happens. The little perve will think agian before reaching his dirty little hand up another girls skirt. He should just be glad your sister/ parents are pressing charges for sexual harrassment.|`|1enIWBGnaa	The boy got what he deserved!!!<br>  Tell you sister, next time this happens - give the boy a warning, if he persists, kick but not as hard as she did the first one.<br>  Your parents are responsible for talking to the principal, plus all of the witnesses.|`|7AUqSr4uaa	people should never kick boys in the nuts. its a dangerous thing to do.<br>  A slap round the face would have been much more appropriate.<br>  If I was the guys parents, considering the damage caused, i would try to take the matter further.|`|hSY0LuCOaa	Grabbing a girl's butt shouldn't result in sterilization.  She doesn't think she went just a tad bit overboard? just a little?|`|sMlNvnxmaa	Lol tell your sister way to go! I dont think she should have been s<br>  suspened maybe just an afterschool lol for hurting him so bad! It was his fault thats what he gets!!!!|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	lol that must have been some kick she gave him. i doubt he will do anything like that again.|`|dIPIEW7Haa	wow he's 14 not 24 imagine the pain|`|J63w02oPaa	i think your sister should get a life and id send her to prison without a seconds thought.<br>  <br>  what a horrible person|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I think she should have stood for herself. But not that way. She went way too far as he had to get surgery for the damage she caused!<br>  <br>  Yeah, it probably would have been different. But she really knocked the guy out.<br>  <br>  I would have told him to f-off and I would have called one of my parents.<br>  <br>  Never happened to me.<br>  <br>  I feel bad because he was so badly hurt, but I don't because he was acting like a pervert and deserved it (in a way).|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I feel she was over the top about that one. Yes he made a bad move first but that doesn't justify her actions. This kid might not be able to have children in the future because he grabbed her. I mean ... come on it wasn't that serious. Maybe a punch in the face, or a slap or something. They were both way wrong for their acitons, but to permanently damage him, no that is very wrong. And i would probably sue for pain and suffering and medical costs.|`|AA10196172	Good for her! (Ouch!)<br>  <br>  !. No, I don't think she did the right thing. Self defence is prevent injury to yourself. This was retaliation. However, I don't feel too much sympathy for the guy. You goose at your peril.<br>  <br>  2. No. But in law, there is a doctrine of "excessive force" - bringing a gun to a knife fight. If he pinched her, she should slap him. She isn't justified in stabbing him, shooting him, or crushing his left nut.<br>  <br>  3. As a guy, I would have moaned "ooooooh!" if I saw that. But seriously, if some gay guy had grabbed me, I probably would have turned around and punched him. Not sure I would have aimed for permanent damage.<br>  <br>  4. No. I was in an argument with some idiot in the mall when I was 14, and the guy kicked me in the nuts. What an idiot. It looked like he landed a good kick, but it missed - he actually kicked me in the thigh about 3 inches to the right. I laughed and called him a loser who couldn't even do that right, and got the heck outtta there, because I probably would not have won a fight, especially against a guy willing to launch a surprise vicious attack. <br>  <br>  (I assume your sister did not know how much damage she could have done. I've hear of a lot of such kicks, but never one that did that much damage). <br>  <br>  5. yeah, poor guy. However, yes, if it seems to be acceptable practice for boys to do that and get away with it, then it serves him right. Someone had to put a stop to this. I assume from your sister's reaction that guys would do this a lot, and the school wasn't doing much about it.<br>  <br>  In the end, I think the school is right.<br>  <br>  The guy did something inappropriate, and should be suspended.  <br>  <br>  Your sister retaliated way out of proportion to the offense -whether intentional or not - and needs to understand that such a reaction has consequences. If she had been over 18 and outside of school, she likely would have been charged, but not necessarily convicted, of assault causing bodily harm. It still would have cost a fortune for the lawyer.<br>  <br>  The school is unrealistic if it expects every student to retaliate for such behaviour by tattling instead of hitting. They need to be more vigilant in supervising and stopping inappropriate behaviour.<br>  <br>  On the plus side, the guy learned - before he was 18 and could be charged with a sex crime - that he should not be doing this. And, it only cost him his left nut.|`|TZi4ChYYaa	Ok I have 2 views on this <br>  <br>  For Amy:<br>  she was right to defend herself and unfortunatly it was probably a natural recation.<br>  <br>  For the Boy (PERV)<br>  Because of what he did he is like this. If feel a little sad for him as he now can't be a father. He will learn greatly from this experience LOL<br>  <br>  I understand why Amy feels that this is unfair- she thinks that what she did wouldn't of happened if he didn't grab her bum. But this will teach her that violence is never the answer|`|XLsnuAqmaa	1.  no, she lowered herslef to his level and was just as immature.<br>  2.  nope<br>  3.  told a teacher or counselor<br>  4.  a similar thing happened to me at a friend's party and i just removed myself from the situation.<br>  5.  yes and no.  he probably won't be able to have children now but your sis's reaction wasn't completely unwarranted.|`|YxFDiEaCaa	I know of quite a few lads that do things like that and she could of slapped him in the face or something, lads are like that they like girls bums, its the way they're made, maybe he shouldn't of done it but two wrongs don't make a right and look whats happened now. She wouldn't like to be kicked down below for something that was probably a dare from friends!|`|uklVm81uaa	I think she had the utmost right to defend herself. I'd of probably done the same thing. Little pervert deserved to get kicked. Though I do feel bad for him, in the since that he was probably just messing around and now look what has come of it. <br>  <br>  Well at least you can now be at ease knowing your sister can defend her self. =]|`|pJieNfzOaa	Sorry but your sister was too harsh, he's a walking talking ball of testosterone and hormones. your sister just ruined his life...no kids|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	1. I think that she had the right to defend herself, but not like that. <br>  <br>  2. No it would not. <br>  <br>  3. If someone ever touched me like that, I would push them away (not hard) and yell at them to stop touching me like that. I would then get the authorities involved.<br>  <br>  4. No (thank god).<br>  <br>  5. Well...I certainly feel bad for him for being in so much pain like that, but honestly...not everyone shares the same view as "violence isn't the answer," so you've got to be careful.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	She had the right to defend herself but i mean that was a little to far he cant have kids because of her i wouldn't be proud but guilty.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	He shouldn't be a pervert..its his own fault.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Your sister had EVERY right to do so. i know exactly how it feels to be touched inappropriately and i almost slapped the guy who touched me TWICE. but his own sister stabbed him and he died two years later. do i feel sorry? nope, and i really don't care. when someone touches you, you feel very angry, violated, and you wonder what possess guys to think that they have a right to just help themselves. guys are perverts. he learned a huge lesson by a big price. he touched the wrong girl.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Yes, she has the right to defend herself, but violence is never appropriate.  I can't say that I wouldn't have done the same thing, but probably telling a teacher or police would be the best route from now on.<br>  I don't feel bad for the guy at all.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	I'd of done exactly the same. Good for her, it's unfortunate he had to get his ball removed but he's 14 so he should of known better. <br>  <br>  Has the boy been suspended for sexual assault?|`|i3pn4jNcaa	so both testicles were removed? i feel bad for him simply because he was an idiot and now look where it got him. now he cant have kids. i think it was self defense but i think next time maybe your sister should use her fist|`|in6nku0Kaa	got everything he deserved fair play to the girl he wont do it again|`|l9ab36z4aa	I've seen this question before|`|0TEvBSQyaa	I actually gasped when it came to the point where it said 'He couldnt produce sperm'  and had his right testicale taken away.<br>  I'm sorry yes she was right to defend but she should not have gone that far.  The boy cannot have kids now!<br>  <br>  Honestly, guys touch girls up all the time.<br>  <br>  She went way too far i hope she ******* proud of herself 'cos thanks to your sister he can't have kids. GOOD ONE.<br>  <br>   I would have slapped him and said Oi!  but just take it as a compliment.<br>  <br>  I do feel bad for the guy even though it was his OWN fault, but he was just being a little cheeky 'cos obviously he liked her by the sounds of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  All i can say to Amy is  WELL ******* DONE :(  His future has been destroyed ;@|`|KcwF3yhLaa	1. Do you think she did the right thing? YES<br>  2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage? no<br>  3. What would you have done? The same thing :)<br>  4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do? no and n/a<br>  5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved? He asked 4 it|`|o8uGsZxmaa	Yes, of course she did the right thing, i would have done the same =D<br>  <br>  Just tell her not to kick anyone too hard next time!<br>  <br>  Although it was his fault, i do feel a tiny bit sorry for him as he now is unable to have kids :(<br>  <br>  Oh well, he should of thought about that before he touched her =D<br>  <br>  EDIT*<br>  <br>  Stop thumbing me down! If some guys wern't such idiots then it wouldn't happen!!|`|vtBW6oQMaa	Im sorry, this is absolutly awful! He is 14 years old, it may be inappropriate thing to have done to your sister, but im sorry, he didnt deserve that. If that was my son i would definatly have taken this further!! She has pretty much ruined his life!!!! im soooooo angry. He was probably only messing about just like other teenage boys do, your sister is the one out of order. I hope she gets into more trouble and its taken further. SICKENING!!!!
fULZei1haa	are you giving him enough opportunity to poop outside?  If you make him wait to long, he may just continue having accidents.   <br>  <br>  I paper trained my puppy, and now if she has to go and I'm gone, she just goes on the paper like she's supposed to, no accidents, easy to clean up!|`|KmC0K59taa	For starters, go ask this in the dog section.|`|EWnTv4hqaa	as long as he dont poop in ur bed u dont have to put him to sleep|`|EBpGhx0Iaa	put a diaper on him.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Buy your dog some special pull up panties with buzz lightyear on!!! ha ha
TSxbN0Asaa	I took mine on days 5-9. My doctor told me to have sex every other day. She told me I ovulated on days 14-16. It only took me one cycle of clomid to get pregnant and I didn't have any side effects. Good luck and lots of baby dust to you hun. I hope you get some good news soon. Oh and be careful if you are using lube. Some of them can have negative effects to the sperm. My doctor suggested astroglide.|`|Sz7cnFRsaa	I to was on my first round of clomid, you get alot of hot flushes and a fe head achs with taking them. As for ovolation every one is different because some can ovolate twice while on clomid, you can do Clomid ovolation tests on google. If you type in google clomid ovolating calculators it will find it it is really helpfull. You usally ovolate between 7-10 days after you have finished your last clomid tablet. Good luck.|`|uNRvZWifaa	good luck! expect awful hot flashes and you should ovulate between days 10-17 and are supost to have sex every other day so day 10 12 14 16 and we always threw in day 18 lol plz o plz if they haven't already make them do a hsg to find out if your tubes are open! i was on clomid for 6 mons before they did one and i was a little pissed that i had to deal with hot flashes for all that time and come to find out both of my tubes are blocked! GOOD LUCK|`|kmKF7AWPaa	Hi! I was on clomid this month from 2/9 - 2/13 (it was day 5-9 like you) and I didn't ovulate until 2/21....8 days later. I had more side effects when I stopped taking the meds, mostly cramping. Good luck with everything!! ~~~~~Baby Dust~~~~~|`|YkX0GZoOaa	I did both, with four cycles of clomid.... days 3-7 worked for me (twice), days 5-9 never worked for me. I think it depends on your body.|`|Gw5j2hGOaa	Taking clomid from 5-9 it is meant to stimulate you ovaries to ovulate. If you take 3-7 it may to early but ask your dr if it is ok. I was on clomid but be aware that you may start to gain weight. I was on it for three months and I put on 3 months I am now on Femcor and haven't put any on.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I took mine from day 5-9 and ovulated between day 14 and 16 everytime. <a href="http://babymed.com/tools/fertility/clomid/" rel="nofollow">http://babymed.com/tools/fertility/clomi...</a><br>  That sight is pretty accurate from what I have heard. Good luck and God bless. Baby dust to you!|`|CUanPEmeaa	I am on what will probebly be my last month. Round 4. I have always taken it 5-9 and once 4-8. My doc says that i am not supposed to start it on cd 3 though cause it will make more follicles. On cd 5-9 they are more mature so he says that is better. He also believes cd 5-9 gives your body more of a break. I think it depends on your doc and what they are comfortable with. Best of luck.
2272ee843f475a18e80ab4395dd15fd0aa	It is possible, but i would give it at least another week. All the signs can also be stress as well, but i wouldn't rule anything out right now. When i was pregnant i didn't even know because i had a period every month for the first 3 months, thats how long it took me to find out cause the fourth month i didn't have one at all and when i went to the Dr i found out that i was 3 months pregnant. I would at least give it another week before you try to test again.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can test 9 days after conception/ovulation.<br>  <br>  Most pregnancy tests list their sensitivity on them.  You want something that says 20mIU/mL or 25mIU/mL<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peeonastick.com/hptfaq.html#1" rel="nofollow">http://www.peeonastick.com/hptfaq.html#1</a><br>  . How soon can I test? Well, first you gotta know how the test works. Briefly: the home pregnancy test (HPT) works by detecting a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG.) When an egg is fertilized, it takes about 6 to 12 days to implant in the uterus, and then it begins to secrete hCG. It takes another day or two for enough hCG to build up and make its way into your pee. So, generally speaking, the earliest you can expect a positive HPT is 8 days past ovulation ("DPO") and the latest would be about 16 DPO. It is possible to get a positive test earlier or later, but not as common. In my experience, if you use a sensitive "early" test (anything that detects 25 mIU/mL of hCG or less) you can test around 12-14 DPO and feel reasonably secure with your results (the later you test, the more secure you can feel in its accuracy.)<br>  <br>  If you do not chart or monitor your fertility in any way, and you think you may have conceived, you should wait 19 days (or longer) after having sex to test. Why 19?! Sperm can live approximately 5 days in the proper environment; if the sperm managed to live until you popped an egg, the actual conception could have taken place several days after the sex act that got the sperm there. To make sure you're not testing too early, assume the sperm had very long lives (5 days is considered a very long sperm life) and that conception occurred then. Then allow 14 days for the embryo to implant and develop enough hCG to show up on a pregnancy test (96% of pregnant women will test positive by then.)<br>  <br>  Note: some HPT's say "test 5 days before your period is due!" or some such thing. Please note they are assuming a textbook 28-day cycle, with ovulation on Day 14. "5 days before your period is due" thus really "translates" to 10 DPO. <br>  <br>  List of brand sensitivity:<br>  <a href="http://www.peeonastick.com/hpts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.peeonastick.com/hpts.html</a>|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Clearblue and first response are about 4 days before your expected period, given you are regular and depending on when you concieved, so you should be able to give it a go around March 2nd (since this is a short month). <br>  It may be too early to be feeling anything, only 9 days, you won't have to pee a lot and the metal taste usually doesn't kick in for a couple more weeks. <br>  <br>  But ya never know. Good luck!|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Get an EPT digital, it worked for me and I had my BFP a week before my period. Get a double pack too just in case you'll need to check again in a couple of days, it all depends how high your hormone levels are.|`|0fbb5e27ed4790306bd5062233798e68aa	EPT|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Unfortunately, only a blood test will give you a true pregnancy reading at this point. <br>  <br>  I would calm down - half of those symptoms could also by just by wanting to be pregnant. Just relax and wait until you miss your period - it would be heart breaking to think you're pregnant or even find out and then have an early miscarriage.<br>  <br>  To the post who said that blood tests aren't early detectors - what did your doctor say? Blood tests can pick up minute traces of hormone levels, even a few days after conception.|`|Di7KqbVQaa	Dont touch a digital just yet - they arent sensitive enough. It would have to be First response or a clearblue.<br>  <br>  PS. To the poster who said only a blood test can tell you....<br>  <br>  Funny that my test must have been lying for a while then.....|`|zBz10IiOaa	ept works<br>  and hun by the way when you said you had the metallic taste i have to say your pregnant i had that too!!! and found out i was pregnant it was wierd !|`|0JHqXKciaa	try first response it's supposed to be able to detect pregnancy up to 5 days before you miss your period...good luck|`|O5LItEFRaa	there is one that says that it will give you results five days before your missed period... but i forget what it's called! sorry!|`|ZzjUHawhaa	go to the drug store and there is a test u can take for 5 days after a missed period.|`|soFpywFcaa	first response goood luck baby dust your way|`|j7l9gavRaa	ept is good|`|S8RL9lieaa	I'm guessing that you're from the UK. If so I've just seen one advertised in boots that gives a result 6 days quicker than any other. TV add.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I have used First Response 4 days before my expected period and it was reliable.
hDnX6Vx6aa	No sorry, I found out on Friday that NOTHING causes a false positive. I thought i had one but after i did some Research i found out that hpt's check for the pregnancy hormone and will NOT say positive unless it is detected. Your going to be a mommy.|`|8IQk7lT3aa	nope! laritab is nothing more than a pain medicine. there's no way for it to affect a pregnancy test. id wait a few weeks, and take another, if it still comes back positive then id say talk to ur doctor. a loritab should make no difference to that. good luck!|`|tyqN6qBUaa	No. I've used Lortab and hydrocodone both for years, and have never had a false positive come up in a pregnancy test. In fact, I'm not even sure how that could happen.|`|xBMaUchtaa	Lortab doesnt have the pregnancy hormone in it. So no it can not cause a false positive. But If you want to make sure of it, take another test tomorrow.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Nope.  Lortab is tylenol and hydrocodone.  Neither of these would affect a pregnancy test.
AA11085356	You have to wait until you've missed a period.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	A day after you had sex?  No, that's WAY too early... so is a week.  The best time to test is after a missed period or about 4 weeks after sex.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Some tests can predict as early as a day before your missed period but I've yet to see one work that soon.  With me 5 days after my missed period was still too soon...retested 3 days later and got a positive.  I'd wait a week after a missed period.|`|nFj30sZcaa	A day is certainly way too early. An early pregnancy test can be used as early as 5 days before your missed period, but is most accurate the day of your expected period or later.<br>  I tested positive on an early response home pregnancy test only 9 days after conception.<br>  I would wait, at the very least, a week and a half ... but it would be most accurate if you waited 2 weeks.|`|qitXGd0qaa	1-10 minutes for a test to process and give a positive or confirm a negative test result.<br>  <br>  As for WHEN to test, try the time frame of 5 days prior to your expected period (with a more expensive, more sensitive test) to a few days after your missed period. If your period isn't regular, I'd say 15 days after the sex in which you think you might've gotten pregnant. So say if you had sex on Feb. 14th, I'd test on March 1st.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	If you pee on a stick it takes a few minutes. if you get a blood test done a day or two. Depends on who does the doctors lab work.<br>  Do you mean how far along pregnant do you have to be? Usually a week after a missed period. Or try the early detection one.|`|xpstigPTaa	After you missed your period you can take a test. DEFINITELY not right after you have sex, that's totally impossible. The egg needs to be fertilized and implant itself into your uterus.If you don't know this, I would do some reading before you try to conceive.|`|6BE9f4ZKaa	2 minutes. any longer then like 30 minuts and it wont be accurate. it will show either a false neg or false positive. look after 2 minutes and thats it. first morning pee works best|`|lqLzULXEaa	No a day is way to early! If you take the first response pregnancy test the you can take it 5 days before your your period starts!|`|tptFCrfraa	4weeks after sex, in the morning when u wake up is usually the best time
uFrqC4Y2aa	I'm 29w and feel the same!! Hurts sooooo bad! I was told to have some water and lay on my side. It helped. Also I left work a few weeks ago because the pain was so bad.  I went to a reflexologist and thought it was a waste of money until the next day and I felt GREAT. Also try a warm bath.|`|xnhwmontaa	try taking a shower and let the warm water flow on your lower back...aww hun i feel so bad for you! good luck!|`|52U22fiAaa	Ouch.  It sounds like you have something more serious than sciatic nerve pain.  I had a friend that had a similar situation, her bones were grinding in the pelvic area, and she had to use a cane/walker for the last half of her pregnancy.  Once she had the baby though, she was back to normal.|`|T9SgqPyhaa	I know exactly how you feel.  For now try getting on all fours and stretching by arching your back and then slowly letting it drop.  This might encourage baby to move a little and lessen the pressure.  At least this is what my OB told me.  The very best thing though is go see a chiropractor, especially one the knows about pregnant women.  The chiropractor can work wonders for you.  My helped a lot with my first.  Also try and find a place that does prenatal massage.  You need professionals who deal with pregnant women to help you the most here.  Good luck hun, I hope it gets better.  I'm only 12 weeks this time and my sciatica is already getting bad.
3qI1oyFaaa	It's your due date. I have no idea what it stands for though, sorry, but on all my medical papers they have "EDC: 05/25/09", which is my due date. I've decided on my own it means "estimated date of completion" haha.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Probably what the first answerer said but if you really want to know it's best to ask your midwife....|`|T9SgqPyhaa	Estimated Date of Confinement<br>  <br>  Its the same as EDD or estimated date of delivery<br>  Its just your due date so long it is for what August 2009?  <br>  <br>  If it is a date of late 08 or early 09, then yes it would be, <br>  estimated date of conception|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Maybe it's "estimated date of conception".<br>  <br>  Lol, it would make sense to me.|`|98WKYtfwaa	it means estimated date of confinement, which basically means estimated due date.|`|Q3aXws6kaa	I agree, estimated date of conception|`|ggrKgJ7Daa	EDC does mean Estimated Date of conception.
Mp9SaP1iaa	The baby will come when its ready no matter if your ready or not.  I had sex with my husband more to induce labor just like I tried with all the other stuff to bring on labor but he didnt come until 2 wks later after the due date. The best thing to do is relax these little ones have a mind of their own oh and they love to play tricks too making you think your in labor when your not. Babies will come when they are ready. Good Luck :o)|`|xGehiZDOaa	People have said that it can induce labor i think your are better off not having sex since going into labor early runs in your family!! My husband and I had sex while i was pregnant and it didnt do anything but if you are worried then i would prolly hold off.|`|BxrU8kUJaa	Sex only works to induce labor if the conditions and your cervix are favorable.  Unless you have been told specifically by your doctor to avoid sex because of a risk of pre-term labor sex is totally acceptable.|`|ibR8TkDiaa	it's perfectly safe to have sex anytime won't hurt the baby and you won't go into labor now cause the baby will not be ready. so enjoy it while he's here.|`|EJ1ZmHVaaa	Relax.   If you are feeling ok I would suggest having the sex. Even if you do go into labor while he is gone (which hopefully you don't!) it will be a very long time before you two have another uninterrupted night alone...|`|cXJQq93Eaa	Being in the military as well this was an issue for my wife and I however that being said there is very little chance of being pushed into early labor in the first 2 trimesters.|`|Dbj8pU8haa	Absolutely not.  Will not affect your baby at all.  Trust me, if the baby comes while having intercourse with your husband, it's just the time for the baby to come.|`|5DJcir9saa	They say that sex can help induce labor if you're already overdue.  Along with eating spicy food and walking.   But those are old wive's tales and its hard to tell if they actually help or not.  You can't control when you're going to go into labor, when you're baby is ready to come out, he will.  So if you want to have sex, then go for it.
l4mMBe5Aaa	We put our daughter in one when she was 2 months old - she had very good head control, and loved to be propped up to see what was going on around her.  You can try it out - if you see her head drooping or her falling over, you will know to hold off until next month!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think we started around 3; try it and see, if shes too wobbly, put it away for a few weeks and try again...:)<br>  btw; they tray for them are great!!even gives them something to hold onto, and u can put toys on it, feed them there later if uwant...|`|HXfHkoSHaa	We started my son in a bumbo at 2 months.  He just turned 5 months and he tries hard to get out of it now.  He's almost been successful, so we're going to bring down the high chair very soon.  I hope your baby likes it because the cost is high for a new one.|`|nZVGUzZzaa	i'm not sure what a bumbo is exactly but i know that with my sons, they say not to put them in the walker till around 6 months or whatever or the jumpers things like that but my sons loved to be up and as soon as they could hold their own head up i let them and they are just fine.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	They say that 3 months is best. You want to make sure that your baby has total head control. We started using it when my son was 3 months old. If you look at my icon its a picture of my son sitting in his bumbo seat.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I started using it a little before my son turned 3 months because he had very strong neck and back muscles.  I call him our little center piece because he sits in it in the middle of our table as we are eating dinner.
iBDU0e8naa	Most doctors say stay on birth control a month or two before having sex to ensure it is in your system... but it is 99.9% accurate... that still leaves .1%... I have known people to be on birth control and used a condom that get pregnant... but that is REALLY rare.|`|AA11447210	No. It's well known no form of birth control is 100% effective. However most of the hormonal ones are 99% effective, if used/taken properly.|`|23bs0kAKaa	It is not 100% effective but it is HIGHLY unlikely that you would get preggerz while on the pill, if u are worried, use a rubber + the pill|`|qQsFTkWmaa	its mostly 99.9%<br>  <br>  but sometimes other factors chane the %..<br>  <br>  like antibiotics...<br>  i was tsking antibotics and got PG<br>  (so was my hubby, but that didnt matter)<br>  <br>  so i asked the DR.. aand shes all "oh, yea that stuff will lower the effectiveness"<br>  <br>  so we called our son the Antibiotic Baby|`|vhMe2oCGaa	Nope sure doesn't ive got pregnant twice whilst on the pill and i was taking it perfectly... and we all know that condoms don't.|`|AA11993919	No.
ApyrV5J9aa	I'm so sorry. I know how scary that is. I don't want to give you false hope, but I had something out of the normal happen that you should look into. I began to spot so I went the the ER to have an ultrasound done. The baby was fine but I kept spotting brown and pink for a few days. It turns out I had a subchorionic hemorrhage meaning a small blood clot that formed when the embryo attached to the uterus. My doctor said that it was small and nothing to worry about but to expect to spot for a while. I did for a couple weeks. They told me not to worry unless I was bleeding enough red blood to fill a pad in less than 2 hours...so bleeding quite a bit was normal. If you haven't had any clotting, it's a good sign. The lack of pregnancy symptoms is scary but at the same time you are entering your second trimester and they are supposed to lessen. Good luck at your appt today. Just say a prayer and hope for the best.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I experienced pretty much the same thing and lost my baby at 8 weeks.  But you are out of the first trimester and the chance of miscarriage is far less.  Please try to relax until your doctors appointment.  Hopefully, everything is okay.<br>  Everything worked out for me.  4 weeks after my miscarriage, I found out I was pregnant again.  I am now 17 weeks and everything is going well.<br>  I pray that everything will go well for you.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Bleeding during pregnancy is never good.  Whether you want to hear it or not, you need to go to the ER or call your doctor.  The fact that your breasts aren't hurting now isn't a good sign to me.  If you are bleeding you need to have them do an ultrasound to figure out what's wrong with you and your baby.|`|lLyyuPpvaa	The simple answer is you shouldn't be asking a web site, you need to see a doctor.  It does sound like you miscarried, but how many did you miscarry????  It is entirely possibly to miscarry one baby, and have one hidden in there still.  The only sure way to know is another ultrasound.  I am so sorry that you are going through this, but you need to call the doctor and get an ultrasound ASAP.  If you did miscarry they have to check that everything got out or you could get an infection and be sterile.  And if you didn't miscarry then they need to get you on some serious meds quick.  I wish you well!!!|`|jtvFoIfhaa	spot bleeding is ok but a gush of blood at 13.5 weeks does not sound good. what did your doc. say? i hope it went ok and i hope your baby is ok. please let us know.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It sounds so but don't panic yet.  At 13.5 weeks you're out of the 1st trimester when MOST miscarriages happen and it could be something else.  My cousin thought she was miscarrying and it turned out she had a cyst.  It was removed and baby was perfectly fine.  Ttry to be calm and see what the doctor says.|`|AA10747002	Uh it appears that you are having a miscarriage. This is what happened to me when I had my miscarriage. The symptoms going away is a real dead give away. My symptoms immediately went away after I mc. Any sort of gush of blood or bright red blood is not good when you are pregnant.
jLLkSWyiaa	sounds like very early miscarriage?|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well if you got a positive pregnancy test, there are/were pregnancy hormones (hCG) in your body, meaning you are or were pregnant. Either you still are pregnant or it is possible that you could be having a miscarriage. Some women get "periods" early on in pregnancy, but anytime you have bleeding during pregnancy you need to get it checked out. See if you can get in with planned parenthood since you do not have insurance. They will work with you on payments, they base their fees on a sliding scale and will work out something that is affordable for you.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	It sounds like you are suffering an early miscarriage. Most occur before a woman knows they are pregnant, they just figure they are a few days late. If you had to positive pregnancy tests and then your period, your body had the pregnancy hormone in it. A miscarriage this early will likely clear up on it's own with your period, it may be a little longer or heavier.<br>  <br>  You can see your dr to take some blood and test to make sure your hcg levels are dropping properly.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry :(|`|XlhBBZPxaa	you can still be pregnant and have a period all the way through the pregnancy I would make a dr. appointment and find out for sure if it is something that has been bothering you|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	I would wait it out for a few more days.  If the bleeding is heavy, then you are not pregnant...the tests could have been faulty, or you could be having a miscarriage.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	If you got your period, I'd say you're not pregnant.  You may have had a missed pregnancy or a very early miscarriage.  Sorry!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	If the bleeding is like your usual periods and not causing any problems, it's probably OK to wait a few more days.  You can also look for a clinic that serves low-income people with no insurance if you still have concerns.|`|6UWFGdy3aa	Alot of people who become pregnant have thier next period at its normal time. You may still be pregnant i would take another test. and if you still think you pregnant see a doctor. if you dont have insurance there are free clinics that will see you at no charge.|`|qQsFTkWmaa	you might be/have been PG its very comon to miscarry and most people dont notice cuz it early..<br>  <br>  2 time i was PG HPT came up + these were tsken 1-2 days after my period was due...<br>  <br>  but the next day i started my period... so i went to the Dr and they took blood and had a look and confermed i was PG but wasnt anymore.<br>  <br>  so i had 2 misscarrys but if i wasnt tracking so well i would have never known...<br>  <br>  <br>  another side is some wemen get 1 normal period during the 1-2mths they are PG... some have periods all thro the PG<br>  <br>  i would wait a few days see if your period conts...<br>  <br>  BUT you should wait 2 weeks to retest.. as right after your misscarry period you still have lvls of PG hormone that can read a false + <br>  <br>  so wait wait and then wait somemore
ZEYEmYRtaa	Yes there is a chance you could be preg!<br>  I hope u r please let us know how u get one x<br>  Baby Dust to u xx|`|fDOSnGpwaa	Is there a chance a good be pregnant.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	There is always a chance but seriously being tired isn't a symptom of being pregnant that early and you are looking for symptoms that aren't there.|`|dSobv28maa	good luck hun<br>  <br>  baby dust to you and your man  :)
BTuFtui3aa	Almost all jurisdictions require you to be 21 to adopt, not 18.<br>  <br>  At 18 in some places you'd be able to get a guardianship order (though many would still require you to be 21,) but this seems like an incredible amount of disruption for the baby. First she loses her biological mother, then gets passed to her own mother, then gets passed to you? Infants are aware of who their caretaker is, and this doesn't seem like a good situation for a baby, being handed around like a library book.<br>  <br>  If your friend genuinely doesn't want to keep her own baby or cannot parent, honestly I think she needs to look into placing her child into a stable situation with someone who is actually able to take custody. If the child can't stay with his/her own mother, it's kind of unfair to kick him/her into limbo.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If your mother adopts, then when you are old enough you would have to adopt her yourself, how confusing for a child. <br>  Try to talk your friend in to keeping her child. She will thank you for it later and so will her child.<br>  I am sorry for your loss, you are only 17 and have had 2 miscarriages, that is a lot for a young woman to go through.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	What are you going to do if your mother bonds with the baby and doesn't want to place it with you?  Legally, not a single thing you could do. <br>  <br>  I think this plan sucks, and it's not fair to the baby.  I do think an open adoption with someone with a proven plan for open adoption would be better, that way the mother could still see her baby.  <br>  <br>  I was a mom the first time at 22, and even that was too young, and I was really responsible.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I think you should consider yourself lucky that both of your pregnancies ended in miscarriage. You are too young to be a mother to your own child, let alone someone else`s. I can not see any government agency allowing legal adoption to take place when the adopting parent is an unmarried single 18 year old. <br>  <br>  I`m not trying to be rude but as responsible as you may be, it would be unethical for any social system to do that for you.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	i mean..you're 18 years old. why do you want to have a baby now? your life hasn't even started...you aren't even old enough to have a legal drink!<br>  <br>  i don't know..im preaching to the choir on this one, i know, but to me it's just a messed up view...you're still a kid, how are you going to raise on?<br>  <br>  not to mention the fact that there are stable married couples who can't have children|`|q4FlSBL5aa	Sorry i don't really have any knowledge in this type of situation.<br>  I just wanted to say to the "military_mommy" that that has got to be one of the most irresponsible things i have ever heard..you think its a good thing that she had two miscarriages?? your sick! Speaking as someone who had a child at 18 and recently went through a miscarriage herself..all i can say is i pity your child for having you as a mother you obviously knows nothing about what it takes to be a good mother it's in no way, shape or form your age that defines how well you can care for a child.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	With your plan, this baby will be passed around like a plate of doughnuts!   Anyway, you're too young.  This baby should be placed with a two-parent, stable, loving home.

w17xLr8waa	pregnant, i had the same thing|`|5yAsj29Vaa	8 weeks late and heavy cm... sounds like you're pregnant.|`|uOp2sdiQaa	i had cramps a week before my period was due, and i only get cramps the day of my period, i took a test and it was positive.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I also had cramping like I was going to get my period a week before my period was actually due.  I took a pregnancy test because I was feeling SO tired all the time, and it came up positive.  Sometimes when you're ovulating you can get a mucousy-like discharge, but you can also get more of this same discharge when you're pregnant.  You very well could be pregnant....Don't worry though till you get the bloodwork back from your doctor's office.|`|kc26mQCBaa	That was cervical mucus. If you're 8 weeks late, it sounds like you're pregnant.
44uorNhOaa	no i was on depo for like 4 years and never had a period the whole time.|`|KGRikkJeaa	no just sometimes your body has a period and then doesnt. im on depo and have been for 1.5 years and i've had periods some month and others not. its just your body reacting. depo doesnt always guarantee period free, sometime you get it sometimes not . its the norm|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Pregnancy makes you miss a period not have more! She needs to speak to her doctor to find out what can cause her periods to be behaving this way this month.|`|QeALCWbqaa	YES
KPYQwyeraa	i had a friend who had a problem with her kid not developing properly she was using drugs and alcohol during pregnancy|`|3F8f1SoQaa	I think when he is ready for that sort of thing EI will guide you in the right direction. I think you can use EI funds for respite care which is basically a better trained babysitter. When he turns 3 ( at least here in Ohio) he ages out of EI and goes into special needs preschool and gets his therapy there. My son has 7 other special needs kids in his class. One girl is deaf and I believe has CP. If I am to believe what my 3 year old tells me, her mother comes to school with her as her 1-1 aide every day! As for the sippy cup, ask the OT about doing a straw cup instead of a sippy cup. I know there is a bear shaped one ( reminds me of the bear shaped honey bottles) that is designed so you squeeze the bear to make the liquid go to the top of the straw so he can suck easier. Check online at www.superduper.com and at www.abilitations.com for some special feeding tools.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	I went through all that about 15 yrs ago. <br>  <br>  Your state should have an early intervention program for spec needs babies. It's usually Birth-3 yrs old. Then they start in the public school system. Do a search for your state and early intervention or spec needs or you can call Easter Seals. They should be able to help you out tremendously. <br>  <br>  Potty training - whenever he seems able. Don't worry about it until he has developed enough cognitively to understand. Same with the bottle/sippy cup thing. Esp if he's choking with it. He may not have the muscle control (even in his mouth) to control food or liquids. <br>  <br>  Daycare shouldn't be an issue. Talk to the director at any daycare. They probably have already had tons of spec needs kids. And they are usually much more adored than "typical" kids so it's a bonus. <br>  <br>  And another thing, if he's going to start school at 3, you're going to get to know the school's spec ed system. Which means IEPs (Individual Education Plans) and annual meetings to determine his course. And of course they'll have the initial meeting to determine eligibility and all that. <br>  <br>  You can email me if you need anymore guidance but honestly, doing some searches for your state should get you off to a good start.<br>  <br>  Edit: I forgot to mention that he may be able to get SSI. It depends on total household income.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	Your local school district will probably offer preschool for you son starting around age 3.  Do a search for Special Recreation.  In IL most regions have a special "park district" just for delayed/disabled persons.  If not ask your son's PT/OT and his doctor for resources.|`|bGyVJ6meaa	If your child has a disability, you will need specialist advice from a professional, as various forms and degrees of disability will have different effects on their development.<br>  <br>  I have no idea where you are based, but in the UK you can find support groups<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CaringForSomeone/CaringForADisabledChild/DG_10026501" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CaringForSom...</a><br>  <br>  Look for support groups in your country.
KPYQwyeraa	where a mask but your doc might not want you to wear nails cause if you were to have an emergency with your pregnancy they will have to tear it off so see the color in your nail bed thats how they tell if you are getting enough oxygen thats why they ask you to not have any nail color on your fingers or toes when going into labor but if you want to get your nails done wear a mask fumes are bad|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I too was really worried about the fumes and the effects on my baby. When I was 38 weeks I finally caved and got my toes done. They had fans on in the salon which helped the smell become too much. I asked for a mask. My Son was born a week later and he was fine.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I go, I see pregnant women in there all the time.  I even see babies in carriers so I don't know if its healthy or not, but A LOT of people do it so....|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I would wait until the 2nd trimester, when you're past the most critical development. Then, when you go in, request a mask, a fan, and to sit by a window so that you're getting enough ventilation from the fumes. As long as you do it this way you should be fine to get your nails done, and the nail techs should be happy to accomodate your needs.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	You'll be fine. Unless you work at a nail salon and inhale the fumes constantly, you'll be fine for the 30-60 minutes it takes to get your nails done.|`|T9hl36WUaa	I would highly recommend that you not go to the nail salon. Its bad for someone who is not pregnant to breathe in those fumes. They're highly toxic.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	You will be fine, stop being such a worry wart.|`|JmXr1agRaa	Although the fumes could be harmful to the fetus, this only happens if you are in the fumes for an excessive amount of time. Getting your nails done does not take a long time. I would suggest, if you have a long period of time waiting for your turn to get your nails done, just try to spend most of the time outside (if it's cold out maybe that wouldn't be the greatest idea, you don't need to get sick). Unless you're going to be in the nail salon ALL day, there won't be a problem.|`|edCUawppaa	I believe that it is okay. When I was pregnant I went every two weeks to get my feet and nails done.  However, I would ask them to let me take a couple breaks to go outside and get a little fresh air and they were completely okay with that.|`|21LiTNVsaa	yes you are ok to get your nails done. lots of people do it, i have and everything is fine. it is a different story if you are around the fumes everyday, but for just one hour you are fine!|`|HkImCOSuaa	It is not ok for you to go and have your nails done... now if you were about to pop in a week or 2 then yes it would be okay.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was told you could get your nails painted but you couldn't get acrylic nails or anything.

hKJIDdVqaa	my question for your mom is where the heck has she been all year????  How did she just realize you are doing bad. *shakes head*  I tell ya, it is just as much your fault.  But throwing you in your room will do nothing. Make no question about it, you would be in SERIOUS trouble if you were my child.  My children are high honor students, they do their work, study and play sports all year around.  There is no excuse for poor grades other than laziness.  You should of been taught at a young age knowledge is power and the key to success. School being such a very small portion of your life but so beneficial. Do your home work, and study.<br>  wags finger at you.<br>  Also how are you 14 and in 10th grade?|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	She's not being mean. She's enforcing appropriate discipline for your actions. She's doing the exact same thing I would be doing with my kids. You may think she embarrassed you in front of her friend but its just as embarrassing having to go up to the school and reassure everyone there that you can indeed do better than what you were doing. Parents of children who fail in school are sometimes seen as failures by other parents so I'm sure that she wasn't happy to have to look those teachers in the eye and say "he will do better next time" when the fact is that if you could better next time, you should've been able to do well this time.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	lol 14 sophomore you should be ahead not behind stop asking fake question for false Symphony<br>  also yea you should be get off of it before i track your ip and tell you mom and dad|`|2Hot9EJiaa	And your question is?  Of course your mom should ground you. Even you had to hide your report card from her, so that she would not see your grades-  You are 14, you need to buckle down in school. At your age, school comes first, video games, etc are extracurricular.  If  I was your mom, I would have done the same thing- you need to learn that life gives us responsibilities. If she allowed you to continue in the bad grades, video games and lying to her, what will happen when you become an adult with no responsibilities?   Also I am very sure that your computer lab teacher and mother would love to know you were no here during school time.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	it is teaching you a lesson<br>  <br>  you said it yourself<br>  you dont like being grounded and she knows it <br>  so you will try to avoid being grounded like this in the future yes?<br>  <br>  so theres the lesson <br>  <br>  you need to do better in school to avoid being grounded like this again<br>  <br>  im sure once your grades pick up shel ease up on the grounding<br>  <br>  something you can do to make the grounding go faster is to study longer than you have to<br>  show her your making the effort and shel ease up|`|xLvmPVBraa	Hahah wow.<br>  thats a lot.<br>  <br>  <br>  But im fifteen, i failed my freshman year. so like. you should really prove to your mom that you can SUCCEED. shes only doing this because she cares for you and wants the best for you.<br>  <br>  So just STUDY STUDY STUDY, stop guessing in school tests, etc.<br>  <br>  if you want you life back, PROVE IT TO HER.<br>  thats what im doing.<br>  haha. it aint easy, but im trying.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|m2jeeo4Laa	I personally think six months is way to long to be grounded, but for now, you need to work on getting your grades up.  Maybe by next report card, when Mom sees improvement, you can reason with her for the X-Box on the weekend.   It sucks, but she makes the rules.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	You must learn. If you see out the duration of this punishment, you will certainly not let it happen again, now will you?<br>  <br>  Seems harsh now, but your mom loves you. It is in your best interest to learn a hard lesson.|`|3w7VztEWaa	No i think that is very good punishment..i wish my mom had punished me for bad grades...i might be a little more motivated and smarter.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	I think this is a completely normal punishment.  You need to learn to not stay up late and not slack off.  This isn't her being mean.  This is her trying to get you to realize that life does not revolve around TV and XBox.  Seriously.  <br>  <br>  As far as the being ungrounded, that's an agreement you have to work out with her.  I would suggest just "doing the time" because if you confront her, you may just make it worse.  She is your mother and has final say over your life until you move out of that house and are an adult.  My advice, don't stay up so late, be on time, and improve your grades by the end of the year.  She may be more lenient on your punishment then.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	If you're truly having this much trouble in school you need to get help from the guidance counselor at school and  your mother to figure out a study plan. It' evident that you can't do it on your own so you need help. As a mother of a 16 year old I have to agree with your mother, that the xbox and other toys come out of your room. They are to distracting for you.  You have to prove that you can study and raise your grades. If you can't study because you can't focus even with out the computer and other things out of your room. You should be asked to be tested to see if you have a problem with learning disabilites.  A lot of people have them and with some adjustments to their classes and working with the teachers can do very well.  My daughter is learning disabled with an IQ of 127 and is  a 90+ average student. But she gets help in her classes, She's allowed to dictate her answers instead of writing them because she has trouble with the physical act of writing. Since she's severely dyslexic she gets more time on her tests and assignments, But she has to do the work and she has to study just like the other kids, she just does it differently. I read a lot of the work for her and her teachers give her written notes instead of her having to take her own.  You're mom is being strict not mean she's trying to get you to take school seriously and to do the best that you can.  Until you accept that you're growing up and have more responsibility, she's going to treat you like you're very young and have to be told every thing.  You want her to treat you like you're a young person but you don't want to act like it you want to be able to do what you want and not deal with the consequences.  That's not real life, you get what you put into it.  If you don't do the work you won't get the good grades and you're old enough to understand the results of that.  If you want your mother not to treat you like you're young don't act like it.  It's as simple as that.|`|OT6vCUU1aa	Maybe if you prove to her you are doing better she will give you some more freedom little by little. You need to know there is more things in life then tv and xbox. So I would pretty much bet that after you show her improvement and stick with it and get better grade your mom will lighten up. I dont think she is going to end her punishment just by you promising to do better. Actions speak louder then words|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	Wow, that totally sucks!<br>  <br>  Try to give it 110% for the rest of the school year. Ask your teachers if there is any extra credit you can do to raise your grades. Perhaps if you work really hard until May or June (whenever school ends where you live), then your mom might let you have some fun this summer.<br>  <br>  From experience, I will tell you that what you're doing is awful for yourself. I did the same thing in 9th and 10th grade and nearly dropped out. I didn't, though, and wound up going to college. But since I didn't have the grades for a scholarship and my parents didn't have much money, I had to work the whole time and miss out on all the fun.|`|fZITwfi0aa	SUMMER SCHOOL IS NOT ENOUGH PUNISHMENT! WAT THE FCK DO U THINK? DO U FCKING THINK THAT UR MOM SHOULD LET U OFF THE HOOK. MY 10 YEAR OLD BROTHER HAS MORE FCKING HAS MORE FCKING SENSE THAN U. AND NO U CAN'T JUST SAY ILL BE BETTER. DO U FCKING THINK FOR ONE SECOND THAT IF SHE WASN'T PUNISHING U WOULD BE STUDYING RIGHT NOW? I DON'T CARE IF U GIVE ME THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS ANSWER BUT GET SOMETHING THROUGH UR DULL HEAD STOP PLAYING FCKING VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY LONG AND START STUDYING.|`|ePpCKNT6aa	I think you're lucky that you're mom shows that she cares about you that much.I wish my mom would have been more concerned with my school work and grades.|`|pRpUBJDzaa	well maybe you should stop hiding bad grades, stop playing xbox, study more, and TRY to do better<br>  <br>  your mom may be going to far<br>  maybe being grounded for 2-3 months is better<br>  and every month if you do good she can give you something back<br>  exxample- if you do good next month than maybe she can give you your phone back<br>  <br>  next month if you do good than maybe you can get your computer back<br>  <br>  ect.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	She's being "mean" because she loves you!!  If it takes drastic actions to get it through your head that you need to give your attention more to school than your tv and video games, then so be it.  If you were my son, it would be that way until I saw grades improve and maintain, even if it was longer than 6 months!  Try to understand that she only wants you to succeed and learn the value of education.  You are at the age where a lot of your choices are going to have a lot of influence over your future.....straighten up and pay attention to what your mom is trying to get through to you.<br>  <br>  I agree with Selar...your mom should have been aware way before now.  I can go online to see my kids grades, and trust me, I'm on it EVERY day!|`|y0iXEYkvaa	She is doing this because she is worried about your future.<br>  She wants you to form good habits so you will be a productive adult someday.<br>  She doesn't seem mean to me. At least she gives a crap about you enough to point out to you your wrongs.<br>  She is doing the best she can with a teenager who isn't listening to what she says to do.<br>  Always have respect for your Mom, she has a tough job raising you the best she can.
fZITwfi0aa	ONCE AGAIN I M GOING TO FCKING YELL AT U, LYING PECIE OF **** THOSE PEOPLE THAT FEEL SORRY FOR U. HERE IS THE STORY OF LIES THIS DUMB DUMB IDIOTIC A$$ HAS TOLD AND MESSED UP ON.

NOT FOR ONE SECOND DO I BELEIVE A 14 YEAR OLD THAT PLAYS VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY LONG CAN SKIP GRADES. 14 YEAR OLD ARE USUALLY IN 8TH OR 9TH GRADE NOT 10TH. SECONDLY IF UR GROUNDED HOW THE FCK ARE U ASKING THESE QUESTIONS? DON'T U FCKING SAY COMPUTER LAB. DO U HAVE FCKING COMPUTER LAB EVERY HOUR? ACRODDING TO THE TIME STAMPS UR QUESTION HAVE A 3 HR SPAN. STOP LYING AND PEOPLE DON'T GIVE HIM SYMPATHY.|`|kzyEuRroaa	I don't think you're going to get many different answers no matter how many times you ask this question.  Nothing is going to change your mom's decision on the punishment, and it's useless to try.  <br>  <br>  1.  For the partial month of August before school you can spend it preparing yourself to not fail that school year as well.  There are programs you can get to help you study, which I'm sure your mom may allow that.<br>  <br>  2. Some families don't even have tv in their house, so props to your mom for not allowing you that distraction.  Make right what you screwed up, and next year hopefully you won't have to suffer as much.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	i thought you were the parent in the other question you fake jusdt get out of here|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Don't do the crime if you don't want to do the time.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Just get your grades up.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	1) You are grounded b/c you show that you are not able to be responsible. Summer school is not punishment, it's a privilege. Your lucky that your school will try to let you make it up instead of re-doing the whole year. You can think about what you did and how you will make next year better.<br>  <br>  2) No TV for people that can't respect themselves and their parents. Try proving to your mother that you give a damn about your work and what you did wrong and MAYBE she might just let you watch t.v. for 30 minutes.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	well, sorry bro, you deserve what you are getting. Not only did you neglect your job (education is your job), but you tried to hide the failure.  That was lying.<br>  <br>  Your getting this punishment so you have time to think and plan how not to screw up your future. Look at the world, people with good college degrees from expensive schools are loosing their jobs and having to take part time jobs, not in their field of study. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you can get out of this with good behavior. Don't ask about it. Take this time to study. Study for more than two hours a day may get brownie points. Prove to them you understand why this punishment has tobe, and that you are taking it seriously to turn things around. You want to be treated like an adult? Act like one. Grown ups work over time when they have to, some every chance they get.<br>  <br>  Make your own projects up since you have so much free time. These could be great, because its not what the school is telling you to do; these could be projects you are interested in. Perhaps you can get some time at the library? To do these projects?|`|jgPXxf5daa	I am a sophomore too and I was wondering why you are taking Bio and Econ I took those as a Freshman. Also I believe you're mother has every right to punish you. At least she lets you read, my mother takes my books away when I do bad in school, and she grounds me from the library. And as someone else said summer school is not punishment. And as for TV if you want to watch it you have to earn it back by passing your current classes and passing your summer school courses.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Why can't I watch a limited amount of TV after my homework is done?|`|Chib4b8saa	Your mom may disagree, but I agree with you, six months is a bit too much. I don't see the purpose in grounding a child of any age. It really doesn't accomplish much of anything. Tell her you are really sorry for screwing up and that you will work extra hard to bring your grades up. She probably won't listen, but work hard to be responsible and show her that you are trying.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	asked and answered!|`|9QdtQczYaa	ooooooh u get a bit owned by your mum............. lol sorry to hear that X(|`|zZv4yYazaa	What dod u do//////

5yAsj29Vaa	That's fine.  Just make sure when you're awake, if you're hungry, you eat.|`|nFj30sZcaa	Yes, it's perfectly fine. Just make sure that the hours you are awake, you're getting your daily intake that you need.<br>  I am the same way, I feel like all I do is sleep. And some days I'd honestly RATHER sleep than eat! But I do always make sure that I'm eating the right amount (even though I'm usually not hungry).|`|ZzjUHawhaa	no, ur fine. u should get as much rest as possible. being preggers makes u sleep longer anyway. believe me wen u r hungry u will make up for it:) i am a mother of two boys.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	yes your body needs rest just make sure you eat well through out the day! (when you sleep your digestive system slows down anyway this is why they tell you not to eat right before bed=gain weight)|`|4yGGjs7zaa	yes thats fine!
jAc7AgOiaa	Usually you don't ovulate until like a week and a half after your period is over. But keep in mind sperms can stay alive inside for 3-5 days...|`|0YTuN71aaa	Probably not, but it IS possible.  I agree with the poster above - invest in condoms (otherwise you'll be paying for pregnancy tests every month)|`|OG661H9qaa	Never have unprotected sex if you do not need a baby.Also did your BF came inside you.If your period finished just two days before then there are less chances of getting pregnant but again please take my words an never have unprotected sex  ..you can take a home pregnancy test dear to find out thinks..
ZEYEmYRtaa	Yes you should have sex while you see the cervical mucus as this is friendly to sperm.<br>  There is still a chance if you have sex the day after you could still get preg.<br>  Good Luck <br>  Baby Dust x|`|WljG2gXsaa	Yes. You should have sex while your discharging cervical mucus. Google Cervical Mucus that should help
uFrqC4Y2aa	The same way you count a month that has 30 and 31 days the same. My baby is due May 20th so I'm just a little over 6 months. ONt he 20th it was 6 months.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	So just say shes 7 months on March 1. It isn't an exact science, lots of kids have birthdays on the 31st and tons of months don't have a 31st day. Its ok.|`|eB75qgcaaa	awww it seems a preschooler who doesn't know what a calendar is has stumbled upon the internet and found yahoo answers. well little girl, you may not know this but February is still a month|`|MmP7Kdg7aa	if your baby was born on lets say the 10th you'll count them a month older every 10th. not all months have 30 days some have 31.
AA11327039	As long as she's not struggling to breathe in any way it probably went down and it'll take a few days to come out.  In the meantime feed her lots of fiber and extra water....to keep 'things' wet and soft.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't pass in a few days you can always see if the pediatrician will order an x-ray to see where it is (could pass without you noticing, or a very small possibility that it's stuck).<br>  <br>  I was babysitting a little girl when I was just a teen and called the ER when the girl swallowed a pretty big button.  The ER said she'd be fine as long as she was still breathing.  I then called her mom and her mom was like, she swallows buttons all the time.  <br>  <br>  I remember thinking, why do you put shirts on the kid that has buttons if she eats them!!|`|i7oGjwJBaa	if it was a small button, it will come right back out.  i ate tons of little toys and pocket change as a child, for some reason, and my poor parents were constantly catching my bm's and making sure it came back out - it always did.  you only have to worry if it were very large, a highly toxic material, or sharp/jagged that it could damage his digestive tract.|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	On the safe side you can take her to the doctor, but my guess is if it was plastic and small you would be okay to let it ride.  If it was metal button or on the larger side I'd take her to the doctor.|`|dSobv28maa	Let her poop it out. As long as shes not having major discomfort. Check her stool tho to make ssure it passed though. i know its gross but a mommy has to do what a mommy has to do. Good luck with your little button eater  :)|`|FXKAGVZGaa	Agree with letting it pass, but still would call the doc and see what he/she has to say.  You definitely need to check to make sure it has passed though, because you don't want your little one to have an obstruction.|`|Wpmkdwvtaa	let her poop it out if you notice she hasnt had a bm in a few days or if shes complaining her stomache hurts call a doctor but if her bms keep coming and no complaints she shoudl be fine !!!|`|2nKe3j84aa	Depends how big it was!!!!! As long as it hasn't blocked her airway, then it should just make it's way through her. Just keep an eye out in her nappies or potty for the 'offending' item!!!|`|TsnXXfI3aa	I'd have to say this is one of those times you need to call the doctor for advice.

Then I waited about another year to have my second by c-section.  But my second was only three months old when I got pregnant with our third.  I did fine, and didn't have any complications.

And my OB's are not concerned either.  You will more than likely deliver by c-section again, because there could possible be a problem once you went into labor and started pushing, especially if you were to be induced.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine hun!

LOL|`|NE1cgh3Vaa	confused....... 5|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i will rate it 3 ... i don't know, i do not have that much emotion regarding this, maybe because my girl were in daycare since 3 months old, and i am just happy for her to start school, i don't want to show too much emotion and make her nervous.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	I see these questions from moms with older kids (well, kids older than mine anyway) and I think...how will I ever live through this?<br>  <br>  When I think about this day...years in the future still...it's about a 20. I'm tearing up right now.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Off the charts.<br>  <br>  -Dominik starts Kindergarten this year, and I was mildly better. Last year when she started Pre-Kinder, I dropped him off, hung around him hoping for a kiss and cuddle, then was scooted out of the class.<br>  I drove to a near-by park and cried and cried and cried. I was shattered. I was fearful for him, and everything in my brain was working over time.<br>  <br>  I picked him up a few hours later, and he wanted to stay there. Hmmmm|`|AA12145826	25!!! Oh I was awful, she just kept looking at me like "Geez, Mom! Get a grip will ya!" I followed the bus to the school, although I couldn't pull in the same area as the bus drop zone to watch her get out. My husband physically restrained me from going into the school (I said "I just want to take pictures" to which he responded "You forgot your camera, you blubbering fool!")<br>  <br>  Its taken a while, but I've come to accept that she's getting older (and sadly so am I) and its a new chapter in our lives.....|`|5EOLbVzQaa	was standing there bawling like a baby when my oldest started pre k same with my daughter and with my 3 year old when he started at headstart and will be that way with my baby when he gets to be the right age. by the time they get to kindergarten they have had headstart and pre k so you are not as emotional.|`|lr9E8IC5aa	OMG, i would rate it at 11. <br>  <br>  I was an emotional wreck. I was talking to my sister as I was walking away from the school, I was bawling. I could barely talk. The crossing guard looked at me and gave me a big hug and said "you're going to make me cry".<br>  <br>  Hopefully with my 2nd child, it won't be so bad...we'll see in 3 years :)
HfVNh4baaa	In my opinion, and potty training is one of those things that you have to do what YOU feel is right, I backed off! <br>  <br>  My daughter was 25 months and potty training was very easy. It only took a few days. My mom was telling me to do it before she was 2 and that was a nightmare. When I felt she was ready, and she let me know, I made it exciting and used a poster board with stickers. Accidents were not a big deal, just clean them up and don't get angry. I just praised her when she did it right.<br>  <br>  I used to think people with 2-3 year olds in diapers were just lazy. Then I had my son. At 2, he was uninterested. At first I got mad at accidents but then I realized it was making it worse. Also don't potty train if you are moving, or having anything stressful happening. (My son turned 2 right when his baby brother was born.) When they are ready they will do it. My son was 2 1/2 and one day it just clicked for him. That's how it is with all the mothers I have talked to. Boys take a little longer. Some not until they are almost 3. Hang in there!<br>  <br>  Again in my opinion, I would not take him in there all those times. He might not have to go and not being able to produce anything for you is just frustrating him. It should not be a frustrating thing at all. He is now associating the potty with fits. What worked for us is putting the potty in the living room for a few weeks, then the hall, then the bathroom. He wasn't using it that much when it was in the living room, it was just to be familiar with. It was where he could see it and we could just ask "Do you have to go?"  That's all the "push" you need. (We have wood and tile and although this was sometimes messy to clean up because he had zero aiming ability- I still praised and gave stickers. We had a huge poster board with a variety of stickers he could choose from and be very proud of. We talked about the stickers a bunch of times a day too.. so he always wanted to add to his collection.) <br>  <br>  My best advice is to change your perception of the situation. If you think of it as "potty learning" - not training- you will realize that the teacher should be patient and always ready to praise. Just like math, if the kid has a miserable teacher he is going to hate math for life. Just make it fun, don't force him, and it will happen. You will be happier too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  p.s. we got potty books too.. the one he liked was max's potty or something like that.. "just like max" he would say. it was a cute book. the idea is to develop good positive thoughts about using the potty. for him, the book was a good reminder.|`|TEG6O7sDaa	I always rewarded my son after going potty with a piece of candy or a sticker.  Read the book "Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day" by Teri Crane. It offers GREAT ideas for helping to potty train and also how to keep up with it when the going gets hard. I also used the potty watch with my son to help him remember to go to the potty he loved how it would play music to remind him to go. They are available at: <a href="http://www.pottytimeinc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pottytimeinc.com/</a> Good Luck and keep up the hard work even though it is so very hard at times.|`|jAVLJOZAaa	That is the right thing to be doing. Try to reward your son with like ceral or something after every time he used the bathroom it will encourage him a bit more to not scream|`|idTdPSvCaa	leave him to have the tantrum if he needs he will either go or will have an accident,he will soon realise how uncomfortable it is to play in wet pants.he is going through the independent stage and wants to do everything his own way,i would let my daughter have the tantrum and if she wet herself then i would leave her wet for a few minutes she soon realised that she had to go potty otherwise she would have to be wet|`|SkOALXv9aa	You are doing the right thing.  It sounds like he is starting to come around so continue what you are doing.<br>  <br>  The tantrums will stop as he will soon realize that they are not working in his favor.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	maybe backing off isn't the answear but maybe trying different ideas to get him to come in the bathroom and try to go potty...get excited...make it an adventure....give him a treat...maybe make it a game, tell him every time the buzzer goes off its time to hit the potty..maybe a chart, to earn prizes...be creative! Good luck
nuBRcuwvaa	Not regulated by state... it is regulated by where you work.<br>  <br>  The federal govt says you can be off 12 weeks without losing your job, but that doesn't involve money.<br>  <br>  Each employer decides if they are going to offer maternity leave or not.  Mine does not... so I only have sick/vacation time to use... and that is at most 2 weeks.  After that, I'm unpaid as long as I choose to stay off.  The only rule my employer has to follow is that they can't fire me if I'm gone less than 12 weeks.  They have to offer my job back to me when I return.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Here in the USA, it's up to the employer.  <br>  <br>  I've never had paid maternity leave.  I've had up to 8 weeks off unpaid, or with a larger employer, 12.  <br>  <br>  But here in the USA, breastfeeding is more of a convience thing - the education about breastfeeding, from pediatricians and even hospitals, is pathetic, and frequently incorrect.  Plus, farming out our kids to daycare, is frequently done, even when the moms are 'stay at home' moms.|`|YP3rEESUaa	We get 3 months of leave and we get about half of what out regular wages are.  I would love to have a full year of leave though!!!  it would be great to have that time to spend with the new baby!!!|`|xpstigPTaa	You get 1 year?!?! That's amazing! Where are you located? I am in NY and only get 6-8 WEEKS off of work for Maternity Leave.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	paid leave is 6 weeks for vaginal delivery and 8 weeks c-secion plus an extra 6 weeks for 'bonding time' any time up to 1 year after birth in california. i think it is 65% of your income but its not taxed so mine was only about $100 less than my regular pay check. you can also choose to take off up to one year without pay and your job will still be waiting for you when you decide to go back.|`|eB75qgcaaa	12 minutes|`|2tLJ5ohsaa	1 year, and it is paid|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I would have had to go back to work after 6wks of unpaid leave. The US government allows 12wks a year of medical leave unpaid and for a regular vaginal birth 6wks is all that is medically necessary. I have plenty of friends that went back to work even sooner than 6wks because they couldn't afford the time off. It's nowhere near enough time with your baby and does make it difficult to breastfeed.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	where do you live? A whole year? down here we only get a few weeks off
sXU3RrfWaa	The weight typically goes to your boobs anyways.|`|be52fc0d175d76bbbfd17b8117a2d632aa	Being a virgin has nothing to do with it!

She may have to try several before she finds one that suits her.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	The pill doesnt make you fat the most it does is give you spotting between periods.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i mean some birth control can cause u to gain a lil weight. if u two plan on having sex then she should get on birth control and u should always wear protection. so u two can protect each other.<br>  <br>  the STD rates out here these days are high!<br>  <br>  and if she gets on the pill it can regulate her period.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I really don't think it makes you get fat. I guess I gained a tiny amount, like 2 lbs. and it went straight to my breasts. That's not something that should put you off from taking it. It's better than pregnancy, that will make you gain weight for sure!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	The pill does not make you fat...I took it for 10 years and I WANTED to gain weight...no luck...didn't gain a pound.  If you two plan on making your relationship sexual she should speak to a gynocologist about getting some type of birth control.|`|naySyzfQaa	No she shouldn't take birth control she should remain a virgin...sex can wait and you should too. That's a serious step in a relationship.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	Birth control pill doesn't "make you fat."  It just makes you hungrier.<br>  Depo shot does cause weight gain.<br>  As long as she continues to eat right and exercise she will be fine.<br>  If she is a virgin and there is no medical reason for her to take birth control then she shouldn't.<br>  But if you are planning on having sex or she wants it for medical use (talk to a doctor for medical uses) then sure.  Just encourage good eating and exercise habits.|`|YlLmAADraa	if she is going to be sexually active then yes she needs to take birth control. brith control doesn't make you fat it can make you retain water for the first 3 months but then that goes away (if it even happens) it doesn't happen to everyone. birthcontrol actually is good for your skin, helps regulate periods and prevents pregnancy. she should deffinitly be taking it.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	Not all birth controls put weight on girls, just depends on the girl really. As far as whether or not for her to take birth control, are you both planning on being sexually active? If you are, then I would suggest it to be on the safe side...but if you're not planning on being sexually active, then she shouldn't go on birth control.|`|p3d3E75oaa	the pill really doesn't make you fat and if she wants to be safe I would a condom isn't always the safest way|`|dgRTkccBaa	Birth control doesn't make you nearly as fat as pregnancy does.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Well.. if she has irregular periods birth control would be a good idea. Birth control doesn't make you gain weight...I never gained any while I was on it.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	The pill rarely makes you get fat.  The depo shot can though.|`|vcfFQSvTaa	i took birth control and acually lost weight.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	There is no proof that all birth controls make you fat. Have her go to a doctor and talk about options, and pick one that doesn't have that side effect.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	Not all women get fat when they're on birth control.  I lost 25 lbs when I was on it after I graduated high school.  She just needs to watch what she eats.|`|2z3lTB2Raa	If you're going to have sex she should. And she probably won't gain weight, it doesn't really happen like that.|`|r6NJrasBaa	i never gained weight from it
lCbsCM6raa	In Canada, we get 1 year of for maternity leave. I could not imagine going back, even after 6 weeks. Honestly, you are like a zombie for the first little while. You can't even think straight. At least, that's how it was for me!|`|Ks7lENScaa	If you are physically up to going back to work/school a week after giving birth and the doctor is fine I guess you can and you have a sitter.  With my daughter I went back to college two weeks after having her.  I had a regular delivery.  With my son I had a c-section.  There would have been no way I would have went to work that soon.  Plus the situations where very different.  I was off 3 months with him.  So it is a personal decision.  Your delivery plays a big role.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its not mandatory, however in most cases mom needs to take at least a few weeks off or else she seriously endangers her health.  Even sitting upright in a chair for long periods can increase the risks of serious problems like clots (which if they travel to the lungs, heart, or brain can even cause death).|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	I don't think it is mandatory, but trust me, you will be in no shape to return to work or school a week after having a baby!|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Keep in mind that not only will you get very little sleep because you are taking care of a little baby 24 hours a day, your body needs to heal after giving birth! Take as much time as you can and get yourself feeling semi-normal before you even think of going back to shcool/work. Good luck!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Every mom I've ever known has always needed at least a few weeks. Getting adjusted to a new baby takes a lot of energy, I can't imagine having to go to work so soon afterwards. I'm not sure if it's mandatory, I'm a SAHM so I know I'm no help with that...but I can't imagine someone not taking it if it's offered.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I'm pretty sure it isn't mandatory-just HIGHLY recommended. Keep in mind that with a natural birth you can't drive for 2 weeks at least and you can't do stairs or housework for 4-5 weeks. If you have those restrictions from the doctor, imagine what he'll say about going back to work or school too soon. Regardless, you'll want to be with your baby and you'll want to heal and rest. Those first few weeks are ROUGH.

kRu5Z4vBaa	it's fine if it's loose at the tip. it is supposed to be, because otherwise there would be nowhere for the semen to go and the condom would explode at ejaculation.|`|dyFlOpYqaa	It's supposed to be loose at the tip. If not, then you have a risk of the condom breaking.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	its supposed a little loose at the tip but if u gotta ask u shouldnt be having sex|`|FQCLDT5faa	ya thats how i got pregnant|`|fRufnTstaa	which side?|`|H2IqzG12aa	The loose tip is probably a built-in reservoir to hold semen after the guy ejaculates so that the added pressure doesn't rupture the condom.  As long as the condom is still intact afterwards, you're safe.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It is supposed to be loose.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	If you don't know then you shouldn't be having sex.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is yes, its fine, its meant to be loose at the top.. it catches the semen.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Yes, the tip is supposed to be loose. It catches the semen to prevent pregnancy.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	It's supposed to have a pocket at the top, just make sure it's not full of air or it could pop.|`|p3d3E75oaa	I know your suppose to leave space at the tip for air or it will pop
Q05rrSX4aa	Condoms are about 97% effective, as long as it didn't break, rip, or fall off then she is probably fine.  Tell her if she is planning on having sex to get on birth control as well as use a condom.  She is probably fine.|`|Vw7Ji0zUaa	no that big i mean did she make sure that the condom was fitted and if it broke or not tell you to go the drug store and get a pregnancy test|`|ywlhky4uaa	Like one in a thousand or something , tell her to get the morning after pill.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Well, there's a 50/50 chance now...|`|vKB8q4ogaa	The chance of getting pregnant with a condom is very much reduced. Theres suppose to be looseness at the top so that when the guy cums he does not split the condom and theres like room for it all. Tell your friend that its also possible that both of them could be infertil, you never know. Ask if the guy went to the bathroom before sex because theres like no chance. Its very slim chance. If shes worried that bad get a test there almost immediately effective. Like it takes sperm 30 minutes or somethign to get to the egg. So like a day after she can take an accurate test.|`|xCifmFfkaa	Chances are she won't wind up pregnant if they used a condom, used it properly, and there wasn't any breakage...tell her to chill.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	If they used the condom correctly, it should be ok, they have like a 3% failure rate.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	tell her to see if the condom busted or something
SPMr3ZJFaa	Oh Hun...I'm sorry.  I actually COMPLETELY understand.  I have a beautiful 6 month old daughter who came from a VERY similar situation.  So this answer is based on what I learned from that.  From the timing you describe I would guess it's your boyfriend's.  Most women have a about a 28 day cycle which starts on the first day of your period each month.  Ovulation happens on about day 14. (so for you that would be about Jan 29) sperm can live for 5 days in the body (rarely most die in a couple days) and the egg takes some time to move through your body.  That means your can be fertile for a few days before and a few days after ovulation.  (in your case and using a conservatively large range probably from Jan24- Feb3) so based on that I'd guess boyfriend.<br>  <br>  NOW, that is not foolproof.  If you have a cycle that is longer than average that would mean you ovulated later...so consider how much time you typically go from one period to the next.  (I would say if its 5 weeks or more the chances start to move towards the other guy's baby)  <br>  <br>  BUT...thank god there is one more way of getting a better idea.  Get an ultrasound when you are around 10-12 weeks pregnant.  Many OBs don’t' do them until 20 weeks because insurance only pays for one.  but the earlier the ultrasound the more accurately it can estimate the conception date.  a 12 week ultrasound has an accuracy of about 4 days...so unless it places conception right in the middle you should have a pretty good answer.  If you wait until 20 weeks to get an ultrasound then the accuracy is 16 days and it won't tell you anything.  (plus you are getting farther along and I'm not sure how long you can wait to have an abortion if that is what you choose)<br>  <br>  On that note, you cannot take the abortion pill after like 9 weeks or so (at least it loses it's likelihood of working) so to use this plan you would have to be willing to have a surgical abortion.  Talk to an OB (or a midwife...in my experience they can be a lot more understanding) about the possibility of getting an ultrasound even earlier and tell them why.  I don't even know if this is possible but worth asking about since it for you it means the difference between keeping the baby and not.<br>  <br>  FINALLY, and most importantly, I want you to know that everything will be alright.  As for what happened with the other guy…please don’t be afraid to talk to someone about it.  Things like that can mess up you head and deserve to be dealt with…especially if you are going to be a mom.  Your baby needs your head to be strait and I know how things like that can mess up you head.  Second, someone else asked if your boyfriend knew…If he doesn’t you need to tell him when you can.  If you two are going to be together it should be out in the open…he loves you and will help you through it.  And the last thing is, I hope you get the results you want.  I hope everything turns out the way you want.  But if not, the decision is yours…I will tell you from my experience, things didn’t turn out my way.  But my daughter is the greatest blessing in my life…and while I had some difficult things to deal with and continue to deal with…I wouldn’t trade her for anything.|`|3aqm1SDbaa	I believe it would be your boyfriends baby. Women with a normal cycle ovulate about 14 days after the first day of their period. Which would mean you were ovulating around the time you had sex with your boyfriend. The week after when the sex with the stranger occured would have been too late to conceive. If you have an irregular cycle this may not apply to you. The best thing to do is see a doctor to see what they say. Good Luck and I hope everything works out.|`|g0xB8Z1Oaa	Hmm, if you work out when you ovulated, you will have a better idea. I would tell your BF, whoever the other guy was, sounds like he was in the wrong anyway, and I am sure your BF will stand by you, all will be revealed after the birth, that is if you want to go through with this pregnancy.|`|sXU3RrfWaa	What a mess...I hate to say it but you'll have to wait until you can get a DNA test. Dont do the amnio.<br>  <br>  Im guessing your bf doesnt know you may have hooked up with someone else. Were you drunk/high and dont remember it? I think you need to tell the bf and get his input on this too.|`|NCiMqpGCaa	It sounds like if the dates are correct that it should be your boyfriends. But I 'm not 100 positive. Is your boyfriend aware of what happened? Were you drugged or drunk when this happened? Please be very careful and good luck with everything.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	It's probably your boyfriends if you have regular periods (28-33 day cycle) ... Best thing to do, is get a paternity test when the baby's born.  Don't risk an amnio ... its not worth risking your baby's life if you don't have to|`|x5OHjdtmaa	ITS PROLLY UR BOYFRIENDS BABY BUT THERES NO WAY TO BE COMPLETELY SURE WITHOUT A DNA TEST...|`|y4xFNvBaaa	wow hunny.... i think its your mans baby does he know about the sex with the stranger|`|7gVrFcYmaa	A baby is the biggest thing to ever happen to you.<br>  First, think about it for a minute. The baby is a human being.<br>  Second, think about your age. 21 is just a child.<br>  You need to talk to your boyfriend about this. <br>  Have you told him that you're pregnant, or that you had unprotected sex with a stranger? Have you talked with him about being a father?<br>  Did you plan on getting pregnant, or just had sex unprotected?<br>  Have you planned far enough ahead to know that a baby is a lifelong commitment, not just until it turns 18 years old?  I would recommend talking to a doctor too. My mom was 27 years old when she had me, and she tells me she was not ready for a child. She planned it, but she didn't think about it until I was born. She didn't realize what kind of  work went into a baby. I would tell you to make positively sure you are ready for a baby if you decide to have it.  And you need to talk to your doctor to see if it's your boyfriends.<br>  <br>  Just make sure 100% your ready for whatever you decide to do.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	If your cycles are about 28-30 days, then I would say almost most definitely it is your boyfriends.  Try this: <a href="http://pregnancyandbaby.com/pregnancy/baby/Conception-date-calculator-4605.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancyandbaby.com/pregnancy/ba...</a><br>  <br>  That will tell you the day you may have conceived....remembering that sperm can live inside you for up to 7 days.  I think with the other guys, it was too close to the end of your cycle, but I don't know how long your cycles are, nor do I know when you ovulate.  The best thing you can do is get a DNA test when the baby is born, that will be the only for sure thing.  I think though (and this is just my opinion) that it is your boyfreinds.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|R1RGYpneaa	im sooooooo sorry i hope u called the cops and i hope ur man did what he needed to do to that punk talk to ur boyfriend and ask him how he feels i have faith in u two and if u can make it through what happened on the 6th u can make it work with everything if its ur boyfriends then congrats keep us posted|`|VKMwjzUZaa	Ok, hun.... unfortunatley these two weeks are close to your ovulation timing and you really cant go by your due date cause its give or take two weeks. Talk to your boyfriend and see what he thinks because there is no way anyone can look at the dates you had sex and tell you who the father is. Talk to your guy and see how he feels. You can choose to terminate... or choose to have the baby forget the test and have your boyfriend raise it as his. There is also a  paternity test you can do while pregnant but.... I dont really know that much about it, just that it is done during pregnancy and Im pretty sure you have to be pretty far along. <br>  <br>                         additional detail answers<br>  <br>  Research plantation bleeding, I dont remeber having it when i got pregnant. Go to babycenter.com and do some research. <br>  good luck.|`|x1emutffaa	aw honey you are in a tough spot ....i think you should tell your bf about what happen he may be beyond words for awhile and hurt not at you but as to what happened.and if he truly loves you  he wont care if it is his child or not b/c the baby is apart of you   it will be tough until the baby is born wondering if it is his or not but you can find out  after the baby is born and for some slight reason it is not  your bf" baby then you can decide to keep your child or give your baby a loving home with a loving family  with adoption but if you really want to know before hand the ultra sound can help and an amnio but i do believe that amnios are only done if absolutely need done not to just detemine dna and the sex of the babyand amnios are very dangerous you can loose the baby or there could be complications.and it does seem most likely to be your bf"s little one according to your dates .that is going by the mayo clinics book dates of conceptions and EDD "s .god bless you all and take care of your self honey!! and if you are not sure if you want to keep the baby or not due to the situation please please talk to a counselor  and dont have an abortion  my best friend did 18 years ago and i dont think there is a day she regrets it or crys.....and wonders about what might have been.and remember no matter what this baby is your own flessin blood and it is ultimitly up to you to decide what you think is best.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	If you have a regular 28-32 day cycle it's your boyfriend's.

You poor thing..<br>  I am unsure exactly how to answer this but if u go on to www.babycenter.co.uk and go to ovulation calculator, you then enter your LMP date and how many days your cycle is.

But hurry, because ya know, the longer you wait......|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Date wise I would have to say it's your boyfriend's baby. It doesn't sound very likely that it would be the stranger's (which I am very sorry that happened, i've been there to) Best of luck to you both.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	it depends.. do you know how many weeks you are? if you do than it will be a little easier to track.. but it will be kinda hard|`|nhQzNOfiaa	true love will be forgiving if its not his baby and yall will still be together. theres no way to know but to have a dna test. tell him its his baby and then once u have it have a dna test to make sure. a helpless baby shouldnt die because of ur decision to have sex with a stranger. r u sure u love him cause im pretty sure u wouldnt do that if u wanted to marry him. adoption is always better than abortion. if u were to have an abortion then u will have to live with ur choice to kill someone for the rest of ur life. most people that do have an abortion regret it 100%. lifes hard but what doesnt kill u makes u stronger.|`|1gF9QVy9aa	You ovulated around the 29th-30th of January, so most likely this is your bf's baby.  But, this is with an average 28-day cycle.  If you have long cycles, it could be the other man's baby.  Depends on the length of you cycles.  <br>  <br>  I'd put money on it that it is your bf's baby with a normal cycle length.|`|Cwqkbp49aa	what do you mean you "most likely had intercourse with a stranger?"  <br>  <br>  Anyway, you either love your child or you don't.

You can't know until you can get a CVS or an amnio.<br>  <br>  However, based on the timing, the child is most likely your boyfriends. Are your periods a normal length? Somewhere between 25-31 days? If so, then your ovulation would have occurred right around the time you had sex with your boyfriend. Your egg would have already been fertilized by the time the 6th rolled around. And if the egg had not been fertilized, it would have died by that time. But this is assuming normal ovulation schedule. There is room for error.<br>  <br>  Another way to get good information is to get an ultrasound as early as possible. The earlier the U/S, the more precise it is on pregnancy dating. So talk to the doctor. I'm sure you can get someone to do it for you. Then you can count back to when conception occured. It should be accurate within a couple of days.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	it is most likely your bf because you ovulate 14 days after you start your period and if you do the math that you have been around the time you  had sex with your man. I am very sorry about what happened to you. It is an awful thing that has happened. Have you talked to anyone about this? Does your bf know? I know it must seem like you could  not possibly want this baby if it is from the man who did this to you but it is not your child's fault. Please if you don't want the baby put it up for adoption. there are so many people out there that cant have babies, just got and look at all the questions in the trying to conceive section. Sorry i know that is not what you are asking but i cant help speaking up for this child sense they cant. Anyways I do think it is your boyfriends based on the dates you provided. Best of luck!<br>  <br>                                                                   Christina
uFrqC4Y2aa	I would use a blanket or ask people to leave. maybe prepump too and have it ready in a bottle.|`|pXSKSS3daa	You can either excuse yourself and go into your bedroom or just put on a cover up(they make ones specifically designed for nursing) if you aren't too shy about it.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Like others have said, it's entirely up to you in your house.<br>  <br>  An alternative to leaving the room altogether is just to turn your back and sit facing the corner - that way you can still join in the conversation, but nobody can see anything, and also your baby isn't distracted by trying to watch all the strange new people :)|`|0wTzlG2haa	IWhen my twins were newborn and I was pumping often (I didn't physically breastfeed, but pumped for 10 months) I couldn't and didn't want to get up and move around a lot. I made sure that folks coming to the house knew that I would be pumping and might do it in front of them. None of our friends had a problem with it. <br>  <br>  You do what makes you comfortable...particularly in your own home. If you feel better about going into your bedroom to nurse than by all means, do that.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	You do what makes you feel comfortable, it's your house. After you breastfeed for a while you'll be able to do so without exposing yourself what-so-ever, so it gets much easier to do it in public or in front of others. The first few weeks I just tossed a blanket or something over my shoulder to help cover up, but I always stayed in my living room even with people over. Nobody ever said anything to me about it.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	What I always do is excuse myself to another room to get the baby latched on. Then I cover whichever side with a blanket and return to my guests. I have yet to meet anyone that is offended or put off by this. It takes a little getting used to and there is a tiny learning curve but it's what I've found works best.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	put a blanket over you <br>  or go to your bed room say excuse me i have to feed my baby ill be back in 20|`|3NyM1cq5aa	It's completely up to you and how comfortable you feel.  My family is comfortable with it, so I nurse in front of them.  They live 1000 miles away, so when they do come to visit, I don't want to scurry off and not spend time with them.  My in-laws are more conservative, so I don't nurse in front of my father-in-law.  With friends, I always ask.  You can also cover with a blanket, or sit in a position that they can't see.  And unless you are very large-chested, the baby's head will cover almost everything!<br>  Good luck!|`|9ro8fiKvaa	If you feel comfortable breastfeeding in front of others then it's YOUR house! People you have over to your house know that you're breastfeeding so if they're not prepared to deal with it then they shouldn't come over. Seriously, you're going to be so tired and happy that you won't care who sees your boobs - I promise! BTW, Motherhood Maternity sells some really great nursing shirts that make breastfeeding very modest for the mom - tummy and all - check it out!|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I'm larger than you, I'm a J cup.  I just go into a room where I can nurse her without anyone bothering me.  I don't feel comfortable nursing in front of others.  The only people I do do it in front of it my hubby and my MIL.  It's not rude to nurse away from your company.  In fact most people find it disgusting that we nurse in the first place which is why alot of women just grab a bottle.|`|4WNeBRjVaa	I'm TTC too.

AA11724307	no your not crazy...I'm 4 and a half weeks and I took a test yesterday after already having tested at the doctor.  I think its just hard this early into it because you not really feeling pregnant yet...or your getting symptoms that you dont know what to think of.  I'm a bit crampy everyday and my doctor says its 100% normal...yet it still makes me nervous.  I am going to try and relax and enjoy it though.  Its better for the baby and for me.

c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Last night my inlaws were visiting and we went out to a really nice restaurant for dinner with them. My husband's and my steaks came out like bricks of charcoal and although we never do this - we sent them back. While our new steaks were cooking our two year old decided that he had had enough of the whole experience and tried to throw everything he could get his hands on, on the floor, starting talking VERY loudly, and generally making a menace of himself. Then my mother-in-law reached over to our 4 month old and said "I think he must have spit up, something feels wet" Well, that wasn't spit-up. It was infact the biggest poop I have ever seen come out of a 4 month old. It had leaked out of his incredibly-hard-to-get-off-him outfit and all over his carrier. MIL and I took him to the bathroom (that didn't have a changing table) to clean him up and he was COVERED. Another poor girl came in and saw what was going on. She was an absolute saint because she decided to help us. All three of us got poop on us, and it took 15 minutes to resolve the situation.  We bought the good Samaritan a glass of wine, quickly drank ours and went HOME! It wasn't very funny last night, but we are laughing about it today. Maybe you will laugh tomorrow :)|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Dang, that sucks! I hate how people are inconsiderate, and not aware of their surroundings!

C6oTOvOMaa	I'm 37w5d and at my last appt on thursday i was 2 centimeters dilated and my little girls head was real low.I also just lost my mucus plug on friday and been having off and on contractions and backaches. I actually havent done too much walking. I often clean the house or do laundry, chase after my 1 1/2 yr old and when me and my husband go shopping we walk around the stores for like 2 hours or so but nothing major. I have been having sex as often as i can and allow the semen to "pool" at my cervix for like 30 minutes or so. I believe that the sex helps more then the walking and doing squats seemed to help a lot also..I also have been eating pineapple like crazy like the old wives tales say but not sure if that helped me dilate =)<br>  and to answer your question to the fullest, if u are going to walk to help speed things up then short walks wont do any good, they have to be very long walks ranging 1-2 hours a day just about everyday, my personal opinion i think that stairs are more productive in aiding dilation and effacing then walking alone...<br>  good luck|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I think you should definitely try the sex thing more LOL<br>  <br>  In fact some doctors recommend it to bring on labor.<br>  <br>  I'd like to say HOW EXITING that your baby is due soon.

I worked like almost 40 hours a week at at grocery store so i was always walking around, and I scrubbed the floor on my hands and knees just to get that baby out. It worked.|`|prqrQcd1aa	With my first child the doctor thinned my membranes at 39 weeks and my water broke the next day!|`|e4aF8tdPaa	well my doctor told me when i was pregnant to have sex. but obviously that didn't happen. try that or walk alot.|`|NeeYnXnKaa	I walked ALOT, had a lot of sex than drank a bunch of castor oil and went into labor in a couple hours.

FkGh0LuWaa	Did she see your bf pierce someone while wearing the gloves?  She may associate them with pain.   Take the gloves and blow them up like a balloon if you can and make a game out of it.  You can hit it back and forth to each other or make the glove into a horse, roster, etc to show her that it isn't going to hurt her.  Also if she can talk try and ask her why she is scared of them and go from there.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	I'm not accusing anyone of anything but is it possible that you're child is being molested and possibly they put those gloves on just before the molesting? I mean, it really sounds suspicious and that's the first thing that came to my mind.

5DJcir9saa	I really like the idea of peter pan and tinkerbell.  It ties in both girls and boys.  Or you could do something gender neutral like baby micky or winnie the pooh.  I have a little boy and did a teddy bear theme, which could also work for both.  But I think you've got it with peter pan and tinkerbell...very cute and original.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	I had twin girls so it was easy, butterflies and other cute bugs all in pastel colors. I like frogs or turtles for little boys. At first we thought we were going to have one of each and I was going to do frogs and little cute bugs. Pastel colors are good because they can be for boys and girls. I like the Peter Pan/Tinkerbell idea that would be cute. <br>  Also zoo animals could be for both. Congrats on the twins! You will have so much fun. Good luck.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think the peter pan and tinkerbell is a cute idea for a boy and girl twins.  My older sis has twins that are a boy and girl and she did there room in NoJo Safari Kids, it has cute lil animals on it and i think it's prefect for boy/girl twins.  So it's similar to the noah's ark theme, which i think would be cute for boy/girl twins too. I think baby looney tunes might be cute for boy/girl twins too.<br>  <br>  Here's the link to the NoJo Safari Kids bedding set: <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2991740" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a> <br>  Here’s 2 diff. baby looney tunes bedding sets:  <a href="http://www.netkidswear.com/babylooneyset.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.netkidswear.com/babylooneyset...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=9875001" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> <br>  This one is a jungle animal theme bedding set that would be cute too:<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10055998" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> <br>  This Winnie the Pooh set would be cute too:<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10192032" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> <br>  This is a Baby Einsteins set would also be cute:<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/detail.gsp?image=http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/08/52/14/03/0008521403983_500X500.jpg,http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/08/52/14/03/0008521403983_500X500.jpg,http://i.walmart.com/i/p/00/08/52/14/03/0008521403983_AV_60X60.gif&product_id=10660871&iIndex=1&isVariant=false&corpCard=false&type=-9223372036854775808" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/detail.gs...</a> <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|x7vTKP24aa	peterpan and tinkerbell would be really cute.|`|yLyMG8Emaa	Congrats! I don't really like using "Disney" characters for bedrooms. Its starting to seem cheesy so I would refrain from the Peter Pan and Tinkerbell (although the concept is cute).<br>  <br>  I like Safari themes that have neutral colors. I like your idea of the ocean/sea animal theme. I think these are the best ideas.|`|Chib4b8saa	Sports for a boy; you can do multi-sports, that way it will last as he gets older and it's easy to find; for a girl, anything Disney really; just pick what you can find easily.

Actually when I first looked at your question that's what i thought you were asking. lol. Like Jack and Jill or hey diddle diddle. Or you could go with a fairy tale theme with knights and princesses. Or a mystical theme with dragons and fairies. Or Hansel and Gretal. Or sun and moon?
sYuTNoEJaa	A very insighful study is "Breaking the Cycle of Hurtful Family Relationships"...........I think it might help you.<br>  <br>  It is published by Search Resources in Jacksonville, FL.  <br>  <br>  I've led several groups.  It's  a workbook with a lot of insight on how our parents can shape us in a negative way.  I highly recommend it to you.<br>  <br>  Your Mother is wrong about you..............she is unhappy and impatient.    And probably angry that her marriage has not been what she hoped.<br>  <br>  You can overcome her messages......................you are a valuable person who has worked hard and overcome much.<br>  <br>  What our parents say we believe is the truth.  The way they treat us - we think  is love...............and they might not have communicated very well.........|`|wZAeBisbaa	Maybe you got your inner strength from your Dad. Maybe it was teachers or friends.  Maybe you realized that you'd achieved more than people expected of you.  Maybe you were just born that way. <br>  <br>  If your mom can't find any good in you, then avoid her.  You don't need people like that in your life. One way to feel good about yourself is to help other people.  You say you have "disabilities within."  There are probably other people in the same situation, and some of them must be children.  Perhaps you can use your experiences to help them cope or to provide support if they aren't getting enough.  Would your local school district be interested in your help?  If that's not workable, there are many other opportunities to help people in your community.  Just read the paper; I'm sure you'll find them.|`|hKP5sQewaa	Just remember that nobody is better then you.

VS8mactUaa	The baby is protected is a water sack and the liquids absorb most of the impact, as well the size of the baby is still small so it is very doubtful, it actually takes a VERY hard hit to even have a chance at harming a baby especially in the early weeks. Id say you are safe, but to be sure perhaps call your doctor to have a look at you to put your nerves at rest. Good Luck|`|QSodlfMraa	girl the same thing happen to me, i bump my knee, but i am now 22 weeks and she is doing great, so at your next check up ask for on ultrasound if you would like to know if something happen but i doubt it honey. the little is great.|`|uuHPneEcaa	call ur doctor let him know and they might check u.. <br>  <br>  u can never be to worry about hurting ur baby.. they come 1st in all this matter. plz call ur doc.<br>  <br>  i always call my doc if i have questions about my pregnancy.. and I am not ashamed of it. yeah ur baby is protected but still u can never be too safe is how i see it.|`|KozoNqpsaa	Chances are everything is fine, but you might want to let your doctor know about it.

Worse yet when I was 4 months old I laid on my belly (I didn't realize I would fall forward like that) and I literally felt my baby get squished from one side of my stomach (to the other) as he was forced to shoot across to the other side. Man that must have scared him, he kicked as violently as he could at that age, and for a long time!<br>  <br>  But all and all it is all good.

Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|xpstigPTaa	I am sure the baby is fine but I would definitely call the doctor to let them know.

I have 4 and with my second I was still doing my sport of figure skating right up till I had her.  I had a big nasty fall at 7 months, we were ok.  By all means if you are worried see your dr, although your baby is not much bigger that a double peanut at this stage..  I will also give you another story. With my 3rd I fell at 8 months at a shopping centre, hit really hard, That is when You start having problems.  I went into early labour but they stopped it.  I am not telling you these two stories to make you worry just so you know that every fall and pregnacy is different.  The 1st fall was while I wast doing a trick that had no hight, the 2nd was just walking and slipped on a wet spot in the centre.<br>  <br>  If you have not been hurt I would not worry although again I must stress if YOU are worried see your DR.|`|nndfTOo9aa	always go to your dr. if something like that happens. you can never be too safe!

My son went through a thing when he was about 13-14 months old though where he would throw up every time he drank out of a sippy cup. That didn't last long though, and after that it never happened.|`|avx7bLnKaa	honestly i don't remember when it stopped, i think once he was on solids and not drinking so many bottles or nursings a day|`|BypjotRpaa	ONCE YOU START SOLIDS IT WILL DECREASE..<br>  SORRY FOR THE CAPS|`|lRq81lu7aa	For my daughter, she stopped spitting up as much when she started to sit well on her own.  She is 8 months old now, but she was getting better after 6 months.  She can't get into a sitting position on her own yet, but when they sit really well it slows down.  Or when they are off their tummy more, like when they are learning to crawl.<br>  <br>  My daughter spit up a lot too.  My poor carpet, but oh well, I can replace the carpet not her.|`|orZjp5ataa	My son is a little over 7 months old and he was the same way as your daughter.  I never used to care how cute the shirt was or what it said since he was always wearing a bib!!!  But now he only wears the bib when he eats and then I take it off after he burps.  He still occasionally spits up after he eats but that's because he drinks it so fast!! It wasn't until a week or 2 ago that he finally calmed on the spitting up.  So you're almost there!!! :)|`|XOtOMncwaa	My son spit up all of the time, I couldn't count the times in one day that he spit up... now he's 13 months and never does it. He slowed down when he was around 8 months, and stopped completely when he was about 11 months old. Now he just pukes on occasion.|`|Chib4b8saa	It's been a while since mine were that little but my youngest son spit up for a while because he had reflux; you may want to talk to the doctor about it; they can give you some medicine that will help.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My daughter's spitting/reflux symptoms slowed dramatically around 6 1/2 months. I feel a lot of it had to do with the introduction of solids and her being able to sit up on her own. But honestly I'm now confused... she is 7 months 2 weeks old and last week we noticed more spitting again and we're back to using her zantac. I'm wondering if it has anything to do with her crawling and this weird position of hands and feet crawling lol. We also have been VERY busy packing to move this week so solids have taken a back seat kinda..|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	WHEN THEY ARE EATING MORE SOLIDS <br>  <br>  sorry i didnt relize caps lock was on

Have you lost any blood and tissue?  If you have, that means miscarriage.  Certainly not a pee test.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	no if you got a faint line your pregnant and a dark line your pregnant it does not mean you have miscarried it means your pregnant. if you bleed heavily with clotting and bad cramps your miscarrying.|`|vcfFQSvTaa	i dont think it would mean a miscarage. it might just be the pregnancy test. when i found out i was pregnant my first + test was reaaallly faint. we had to take another one.|`|xpstigPTaa	It could definitely just be the test. I would call the doctor though and have your HCG and Progesterone taken to make sure your levels are still increasing. Best of luck!!!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	No it does not, if you are not cramping and/or bleeding then you are not likely to miscarry <br>  Your HCG levels may just be decreasing or it may just be the test! Don't worry!|`|BbwI6CJqaa	Hi there, I have had 4 kids and all have first been with a home test.  With my last we did 5 home tests, as the 1st was positive then negative, then positive then again negative.  If you have had one come up positive the see your DR for a blood test to confirm it.  I would not be worried.  If you have a miscarriage you bleed heavy and it is bright red first.  So unless this has happened you are Pretty safe.  Again if want clarification see your DR.|`|umca7pwoaa	It could just be the tests or the difference in time of day you've taken them. Or perhaps your fluid intake was larger and you had peed more often. Bleeding, cramping, expelling tissues,  & HCG levels dropping in blood tests are the sort of thing you would need to worry about.|`|ibR8TkDiaa	could definitely just be the test. take other test to make sure or go get a blood test|`|r6NJrasBaa	i dont think so, if you have cramps and bleeding, then sometimes that means miscarriage|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It could just be the test.  I would get a blood test to see.
GwQIYl56aa	that's freaky you remind me of that scary octomom.|`|8dhe15MUaa	no only one she kids of her own now|`|nzgZR6onaa	I had five children and there are pros and cons.I had a regimented schedule to a certain point but then we had our family night on Fridays. I also had individual times I spent with each kid.Yes it was hard financially and the kids certainly did not get 100 dollar sneakers as some kids did in a family that only had one or two. And it takes a lot of dedication and planning to make a large family run smoothly but it was worth it! My kids had a lot of sibbling rivalry and such but so can a family with two kids.But don't do it if you can't afford to because it is not fair to the kids at all or if you don't have enough house space. Then you will be like the wacko octumom.And your husband has to want a big family to because it is very stressful and can ruin a marriage if the two of you don't agree on how to raise them.So plan carefully and cautiously before you just start having babies.It can be a selfish thing just because you want.I was pulled in 5 different directions.They all were in sports and practices and trying to get everyone where they had to be was a real challenge. Band practice etc...Money for school pictures wow!!! School supplies at the beggining of each year and school clothes and shoes!!!  Making lunches or buying lunch at school was expensive and a lot of peanutbutter and jelly was eaten! But in general the grocery bill was high and with todays prices I don't know how we would afford it. My kids were raised in the 80's and 90's. What about good medical insurance! Even with insurance these days co pays and medicine still costs alot!!!!! Dentist too!And what if they have a medical problem.. All kids get sick or hurt sometime in their childhood,Thats why I said one step at a time!!! Good Luck and Good Judgement to you!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I only have one child, but I am from a big family. My parents had 6 kids... I remember when I was about 7 or 8 I wanted a big family like my parents. I changed my mind after having one, lol. I knew I wouldn't be able to handle more than 3 kids!! One is already a handful.|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	I'm 14 and I want 6 kids. I don't care what other ppl think because I LOVE kids and I want a big family. I really cannot give you any advice but I would plan to stay in school and start having kids once you are married.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Since I was young I had always wanted 6 children.  I'm 33 now and about to have my 4th.  Kids can be expensive if you buy them everything they want, but if you learn to be thrifty now and you plan to breast feed and figure out what's important and not buy every trend, you'll be fine.  This is my 4th boy, so I've really only had to buy things for the first one and then pass it all down.  Kids are only expensive if you buy them expensive stuff.  You don't have to give into the hype.  And since you are young and want a lot of kids, start reading and doing research on midwives now.  It is safer and a much better experience than putting your babies and yourself into the hands of doctors.  Good luck|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	Ive been a child of 8 and can tell you it's no fun! sibling rivalry is high, parents do their duties but didnt really know us indidually at all, I can honestly say my mother doesn't know me for who I am at all, not through neglect but theres only 24hours in a day and 8 children by the time youv'e gone through the very basics of child care the days are over, us as children had so much more chores to do you wouldnt dream of a single or smaller family doing, i.e having to clean bathrooms at 6, iron by 8.. take care of younger brothers and sisters when we hit teens ourselves, I was the eldest and that is my point, the yuoungest of children though I know feel equally as put out in their own ways as much of their upbringing was to us the older siblings whilst new babies came along.. <br>  <br>  As a result of all that I settled myself on 3 children, I struggle to give each individual time and attention, my children dont need to do chores because I have the time myself, they dont need to watch their younger brother and sisters because thats my job and i have time to do so, Its not about whats best for us parents before you bring children into the world consider the consequences upon the children your bringing in, they only have one childhood and its our job to make it the best one they could possibly have.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your future!|`|AWqGmJUxaa	well i have 4 so i don't find it to bad it not so good when one becomes ill they all do you relly have to look at the pros and cons but you  r still very young get your self a good good frist and make something 4 your self i'm lucky i can take my kids to work with me but as i said when one is sick they all r like all of mine were last week|`|tWvM6M0raa	i think it is good that you want a big family<br>  it will mean none of the children will ever get bored.<br>  <br>  if i where you i would wait at least until you are 20 before you start having children, don't have them straight after the other or that would be harder.<br>  wait until some are older then they can help you with looking after them<br>  <br>  <br>  can you answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223122955AAe5TEv&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|JFr7fCiXaa	when you grow up and have one you might realise that it will be very hard work to have that many, put then again lots of people do, if you can afford to look after them all then why not? at your age concentrate on having other dreams thou, you dont wanna get old too soon!|`|JmM8xCbLaa	I have only had the one, but I went to school with a girl of 11, and no i'm not lying!|`|eB75qgcaaa	all i can say is HEAR COMES THE PAIN|`|jAc7AgOiaa	I'm not a parent but I'm the oldest of a family of 11.

373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Well it is always going to be your choice hun, here's my choice that I made...<br>  <br>  I am 20 years old, I have been with my partner for 4 years, I fell pregnant by accident at 18. I had been to college to do administration. So I had SOMETHING behind me atleast. I am now desperate for #3 (we lost #2 last month, I was 19 weeks with a girl)<br>  <br>  Having my son, is when I decided what I really wanted to be, a midwife. If I could have realised first, gone to uni, THEN had my son after, I so would. However, 2 years ago I became pregnant very quickly, no problems, 2 years on, I've had no end of problems TTC and 4 miscarriages. Who's to say that won't happen to you?<br>  <br>  I want to complete my family, have my next child and then go to uni. I will be around 25 when I am a student. Which I don't think is that bad really considering there are 40+ year old student midwives (I work on a labour ward so I know)<br>  <br>  So my point- (lol sorry it's so long) is, although you CAN do it after you have had children, it's much EASIER to do it first. If you are that desperate for a baby and you can financially afford it why not people might sat? My problem is with the women who choose a career, start TTC over the age of 40, who are then devastated when they can no longer fall pregnant naturally. It must be heartbraking.<br>  <br>  To me, having children is MUCH more important that a career, but then I don't get to go on 3 holidays a year etc. I live a normal life, we pay our bills and spend whats left on the things we love. I would be much happier like this, as a mum. Than well off, with out children.<br>  Life is one big game of chance. It's totally up to you hun.<br>  Good luck xxx|`|vGxipYJnaa	Since you asked, I'll give you my honest opinion. You should wait until you've finished your course. The longer you delay your education, the less likely you are to complete it. <br>  <br>  I waited until I finished law school to start a family and it was a great decision. It's so much easier to study without a newborn in your life. You'll be a great mother - just wait a year or two. There's no rush.|`|OYvviDoTaa	I think you finish your course then TTC..<br>  <br>  If you had your baby first..you'll never know when you can start your course because you'll never know when you're gonna have the time to..<br>  <br>  So Now Your time's yours and you should focus..Then after you finish..Start your dream of TTC..<br>  <br>  Never Let Go Of Your Dreams..Just be organized and responsible..<br>  If you started your course and TTC in the same time then had a baby while on course..it wont be fair for the baby or the course..i mean neither will get the deserved time..<br>  <br>  I hope i am not being harsh but honey i am telling you honestly what i'd do if i am in your shoes..<br>  <br>  Lots of Luck =)|`|sk46uigvaa	Firstly.....<br>  <br>  Do you have your own house??<br>  Does your partner have a full time decent paid job??<br>  Are you prepared for the mental exhaustain that parenthood can bring??<br>  Have you been together for ATLEAST 4-5+ years??<br>  <br>  If you don't have your own house then really theres no point having a baby until you do, when my husband and i had our daughter who was unplanned we had no house (we were 17) we managed to scrpae together the money to rent but it was hard work and expensive.<br>  <br>  If your partner is a student too then you will not be able to afford a baby trust me! they are expensive!!<br>  <br>  Being a parent is very exhausting and frustrating at times, having fun is limited, as well as being able to spend money frivously and a sex life can be challenging so be prepared for that!.<br>  <br>  If you havent been together long then your relationship maynot survive the difficultites of a having a child, best to waitr unitl you have been together living as 'husband and wife' for a while before you ttc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally i would finish your studies, you have soooo much time left to have a baby, if you have one and leave your course (you will have to) then you will regret it, being a nurse is an amazing thing and can take you so many places in life!!.<br>  <br>  My mother was a nurse and had just got into the Army, she was due to move to Gibralter, but found out she was pregnant with my oldest brother, of course she had to give that idea up!.<br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly wait, The uk needs more nurses...besides myu auntie is a nurse on VERY high earnings, she owns 2 properties and is one of the top nurses (higher up then some docotrs!) in the south, she has 2 children and waited till she had finished her training before she had them. <br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	I would wait. In fact, I did. I've always wanted kids, but waited til I was qualified and had a couple of years' work experience behind me.<br>  <br>  You're unlikely to go back if you have a baby mid-way through your course. If you wait, you'll be able to better provide for your child.|`|X7G6vhGzaa	When you get your BFP its too late to deal with it. <br>  <br>  If you dont think you can manage a course and a baby then you dont have to!|`|758cDKEFaa	i agree with your partner.<br>  you'll figure it out when the time comes, after all it might take some time for you to get pregnant - you just dont know.<br>  good luck with everything!|`|wUVUXHZtaa	I would wait until I finished school, then try,|`|3fYRi1y4aa	If I was you I would finish school and then try to conceive.|`|4gjPQFBDaa	I do not think you are being selfish at all! It's down to what you both feel will be best really. <br>  <br>  I met my partner 3 years ago and after 2 years we were engaged. He has a daughter from a previous relationship - that he doesn't see that often (he's currently fighting to see her more) but he really wants a baby with me now. I'd love a little one as I've regretted my abortion (had 6 months into the relationship) ever since. The abortion was right for us at the time but since then we've both wished we had done different. <br>  <br>  I'm currently studying to be an accountant and I'm working full time plus doing a part time course, which works great for me BUT we both said that we would like a baby now. Originally we were going to wait until I'm qualified (I've got about a year and half left) but now we've decided to ttc because it's what we BOTH want. If it happens it happens if it doesn't and I complete my course first it's a bonus. We're taking it easy and not getting too stressed out about the whole thing. <br>  <br>  Do what feels right for you! I think your partner is being sensible about saying keep on trying but if you really really really want to finish your course first I'd go ahead and do that! He will understand.<br>  <br>  Good Luck Honey xoxox|`|o4kkU2kSaa	Well I feel like you I am ready to start a family as well as my fiance. I start school this summer for the RN program and I am also a cosmetologist and I have a client that is a RN and I was talking to her about us trying to start a family and she told me that it is best to get your career first because it is a work load and with long hours and being on call as well so you wait until you get established first.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	I think it would be a good idea to wait, I had my son while I was doing only an Access to Nursing and the stress was enormous.<br>  I almost packed it all in.<br>  Trying to juggle every thing be a good mum and course work was a night mare.<br>  Would not recommend it.<br>  It is only another 2 yrs to wait until degree is finished and then u will be able to enjoying being a mummy.<br>  Hope this helps x
SVyBjDguaa	Kalia<br>  <br>  =]|`|bIaywrBCaa	Kalia|`|7drjpohUaa	I like Kensley a lot better. Kalia is cute but it just... is strange to me. Kensley sounds better! Also, if you like Sienna (which is an adorable name by the way!) maybe you'd like Selena or Serena? Or maybe Celene/Celena or Cerena? I like them all a lot.

oVxr5B3Eaa	I think that if you don't have any particular attachment to any day and wish it to be fate.. You first option could be to let the hospital pick for you. This would be as close to "fate" as you could actually get. <br>  If you want it to be more natural, you could drag it out as long as possible. <br>  If you want to see your baby faster, schedule it sooner. <br>  <br>  OR, you could go for Thursday. Why Thursday? Be induced Thursday, have the baby Thursday or Friday. This gives you all day friday to be with your husband and your new baby. Then, all your relatives/friend will be off for the weekend (given they work M-F jobs), and can come see your baby which they will undoubtedly be wanting to do. This way, you have a bit of time to get some rest, settle down and have some alone time with your baby, but the fam still gets to see him (him?) soon after. OR, if you want your family to be able to see him asap, do it friday. If you want the max amount of alone time before your hoarded with visitors, do it monday. Insist you have no visitors in the evening, as i know company can be quite tiring. I guess if all else fails you can use it as a way to control when you get your rush of visitors. <br>  <br>  <br>  Or you could just put all the days on pieces of paper and put them in a hat and draw one. That could be efficient as well if it really doesn't matter to you!<br>  <br>  ORRRRR Try and calculate it so Baby's 21st birthday  falls on a weekend. I'm sure that would be a thoughtful thing to do! Just find the year that he'd be 21 and look at the dates. I would have LOVED that! (I became legal on a sunday. I basically had to wait a WHOLE week to celebrate! It was no good!)|`|dbafItLvaa	I'm due June 28th, and I'm with you, I'd rather he/she just decide to come out, but if I had to pick, I'd choose July 5th because on that day my grandmother will be turning 91.  I just think that would be very special.  I'm trying to talk my hubby into naming the baby after her if it's a girl.  Her name is Helen, btw.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I would choose it for the earliest day possible, simply because i know being overdue would be very uncomfortable, i'd want to meet my baby and want it to be all over with asap and i know that being overdue can cause problems.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	my cousins birthday is 6/7/89  and then my nephews birthday is 11/11/04 so all the ones add up to four.. its weird lol... but whatever day you want to me your little angel! :) congrats!|`|bspRfskYaa	Mondays child is fair of face,<br>  Tuesdays child is full of grace,<br>  Wednesdays child is full of woe,<br>  Thursdays child has far to go,<br>  Fridays child is loving and giving,<br>  Saturdays child works hard for his living,<br>  And the child that is born on the Sabbath day<br>  Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.<br>  <br>  This is an old english poem that we use to describe people born on certain days - maybe this will help you choose?|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well the way we decided ours was based on the max number of days my husband would get off.  He is a cop and works 4 days on and 4 days off and he is taking a minimum of 2 weeks off.  If we induce on his first off day then he will automatically have 20 days off of work to help me out since this is our 2nd baby.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I dont know what day to choose but i went into labor the day i had a dr app to disscuss inducing me. i too was a week late. same thing happened to my ex stepmom with my brother. good luck maybe the same will happen to you. xxcongrats|`|zKEgGwhxaa	I would pick Thursday Feb. 26th.  It's a nice, even number, and it's the earliest day possible.  As far as astrological signs, you will have a Pisces as long as he's not born before March 20th.|`|6DNHxcSsaa	Do you have a medical condition that makes your doctor discuss induction already?  <br>  Babies indeed having a natural way of knowing when it's time to be born. It is very frightening that we live in the USA where inductions are reaching 70% of all births. Since an induction is twice as likely to end in a C-section, no wonder that rate is 1 in 3 births.<br>  I guess what I'm saying is to investigate inductions. Find out why it's being suggested. What are the risks? What are the benefits? What method will be used to induce you?  etc.<br>  I wish you Birth Blessings!|`|I2n0fNFAaa	honestly, when i was induced i was told to by my dr two weeks before my due date and to do it the week before. so i was given the option of do it next tuesday or wait until due date. so i can't really help you, but just do what feels best for you. when can you and your husband both get off? is a certain day of the week or date more desireable to you? since your husband only has ten days, schedule it so you can include the most number of his regular days off in the equation. sorry not much help, but i hope this helps a little bit! good luck!|`|QSodlfMraa	if i were to do that i would pick a symbolical number, like how my mother and my hubby are both born on the 7 and 7 was always my favorite number that is how i would, but best of luck with what you chose:).|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I would just pick the earliest date if my baby was overdue and they were inducing me, because I am sick of being pregnant and would like to meet my child! :]

We seem to have really similar taste.  I love Ada Lillian as well, but Lydia has the edge for me.<br>  <br>  Elijah Thomas is lovely.  Eli can then be a nickname rather than naming it as a first name.  Tristen Joshua is my second favourite because it flows really well.<br>  <br>  Really good luck :)|`|7QZvIab6aa	I like Lydia grace and  Elijah Thomas..but don't shorten it to Eli..|`|fboC1N7gaa	Holden Smith and Lydia Grace are my favorites|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	Girls: I like Liliana instead of Lillian.  I like Grace as a middle name.  I actually have Liliana Faith on my name list and like all of those kinds of names for a middle name.  Catherine and Elizabeth are nice too, i'd use them as a middle name but not as a first name.  I really dislike Esther and don't really like Roxanna- maybe as a middle name it would be ok if you want to continue using the family name.<br>  <br>  Boys: I like Avery and James (i like james better), I love the name Tristan because i knew a sweet little boy growing up with that name.  Elijah, Thomas, and Joshua are ok.  I really am not a big fan of Holden and Smith sounds like a last name.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and sorry if i was too harsh.

teDI6RQ8aa	What do you need her support for?  I'm a married woman and don't need my mother's support.  My mom doesn't agree with everything I do, but I don't care.  She can say what she wants, and sometimes I take her advice, sometimes not.  I don't let what she says bother me.  Just like she doesn't need my support in anything she does.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you did say the dog has pancreatitis, had a bad reaction to vaccines recently, so you really need to get to the bottom of this.<br>  <br>  I would take my dog to the best vet.  I don't care if they know my parents or not.<br>  <br>  Sounds more like your mother is giving you advice and you might be taking it the wrong way.  Should it turn out the dog will never get better, it would be best to put him down, if that's what she's saying.|`|wZAeBisbaa	You are an adult.  You can make your own decisions about your dog.  Your mother may really believe your dog is sick and that there is nothing that can be done.  Since you don't agree with her opinion, don't ask for it.  If you would like her support, tell her how you feel.  Say that you're worried about your dog - he means a lot to you - and can she understand that?  She should be able to support you emotionally without agreeing with your decision.  I do it for my grown kids all the time.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	You'll figure out what is going on with your dog after you talk to a vet. Your mom probably doesn't want you to spend a lot of money on the doggie because she thinks that you and your hubby could use it for yourselves. I know how it feels to have a sick pet, believe me. Even if your mom loved the dog, she would still want you to recognize that things happen and that you may need that money somewhere down the line.<br>  She's a mom...that's just how we are.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	she seems to have something against him for some reason as maybe its guilt over the other little poodle your sister has  what zack has can probably be treated and kept at bay with the right medication its just finding the right balance of medication to work if you can get a second opinion go for it you another vet may find medication to work for him forgive me for being blunt about your mother but maybe it is guilt over the little poodle your sister now has he will be fine marie i have a good feeling about it then again is she afraid that you are too attached and will get upset if he dies but somehow or other i dont thnk that will happen for a long time yet as my little man is a fighter and he will fight to get better i just know it|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	If you don't like what she is saying...stop dragging her into the topic of convo.<br>  <br>  When my lab went into the ER vet for surgery, I called my dad crying.  He said, "it would be cheaper to just put him to sleep."  Clearly, I wasn't going to get support from THAT person...so I called my grandma instead.  Sorry, but not everyone will say what you want to hear.|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Take your dog to the vet you want to go to... and quit talking to your mother about it.....|`|2stBV6XBaa	She sounds like she's either:<br>  1) a drama queen<br>  2) a very negative person<br>  3) someone who enjoys making people upset<br>  4) not very sensitive<br>  <br>  Quit talking to your mom about your dog.  Take your dog to who want to take him to.  And if you're old enough to be married, you're old enough to tell your mother to shut up and butt out.

S5n5Za78aa	is this even a serious question ?????????<br>  and wtf does this have to do with trying to concieve ???????|`|60c23c4e75582a183b256dc1695d7638aa	There's no way to make your vagina loser to help with sex. It is a good idea that you are that wet down there because it helps the penis slide in and out smoothly. If you are dry, it's going to hurt because there will be a lot more friction. Being wet down there is a good thing!<br>  <br>  When you two have sex, just take it easy. Once he gets it in, it'll be a bit more comfortable. Please use a condom as well! I think after you get use to having sex, it won't feel so tight down there. Good luck!|`|WljG2gXsaa	He should try fingering you first so that your not so tight.|`|zTFuXOCpaa	use a lubricant|`|iIVnndPzaa	USE A TURKEY BASTER... ARE YOU TRYING TO GET PREGNANT? LOL|`|34HZwC29aa	The most important thing is that you relax. If you are nervous you will tense up and it'll make penetration more difficult. Lubrication will help a lot and may ease the discomfort of your first time. Just make sure the lube is water based and not oil based (as oil corrodes condoms). When your bf is about to enter take deep breaths and relax, there's no rush, the more you practise and become more comfortable with each other the easier it will be x safe sex x|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	You should try lots of foreplay, and try and relax and enjoy it.

yLyMG8Emaa	Some kids say an occasional bad word. Everyone has heard a story of their first curse word. However, if she begins to say them more frequently than you are comfortable with then you should start doing other things. The first time she did it your response was good. If she does it again, I would show her by my actions that I am upset with her (stern voice and deal w/ it immdeiately). I would take away something from her that means a lot (toy,video,etc) and explain why she can't say that word and what will happen the next time she does. The next time should be something that seems a little harder on her (longer time out and longer time without her favorite toy).|`|q7hACARUaa	I think it should be asked where she is hearing language like that in the first place. If you or other adults in her life use that kind of language around her, then I think that behavior should be stopped if you have any hope of stopping your daughter from using it.<br>  <br>  When I was older ( a teenager) my mother said she would make me read the dictionary if I couldn't think of something more intelligent to say. After one or two times of that, well, let's just say I hardly ever swear. I think it really is a habit, and you don't want your little one starting such an awful habit so early.<br>  <br>  I think there should be swift and severe consequences if she does use words you don't want her to, such as a time out or loss of privileges (tv, computer, video games, whatever she likes to do) and you HAVE to consistently follow through.<br>  <br>  Talking to her and showing her more appropriate ways of showing her anger and helping her remember to do them (she's pretty young) would be a good idea, too.|`|agS1kmhLaa	The first thing I would do is figure out where she is hearing this type of language then remove that influence (movies, music, acquaintance, etc.).  <br>  Next, I would discuss the fact that this word and others like it are not allowed in our home.  I would also set out a clear consequence that will happen if she uses that word again (loss of privilege, loss of favorite ________, loss of free time, you figure out what will make the point...). If it happens again, your job is to calmly remind her that she made a poor choice and enforce the promised consequence!|`|UX0Ys5bKaa	take away privaliges|`|ccRBFQTtaa	wash her mouth out with soap!|`|AA11327039	My cousin always made her boys hold a bar of soap in their mouth for 10 seconds (one Mississippi, two Mississippi....)<br>  <br>  A friend always puts a drop of lemon juice or hot sauce on her children's tongues.|`|A3fYo8eYaa	Well my Mom had a little jar that she had fake coins in it and whenever I did something good. My Mom would put a coin in and if I did something bad she'd take two coins away. It really helped. I feel like my Mom and I get on well now. Of course we don't use this discipline method anymore. <br>  <br>  You could also tap her mouth or tell her shes not allowed have a treat after dinner. <br>  <br>  You could put her on a naughty chair and tell her to sit there for 5 minutes. ( Little children always stay there,even though there's nothing stopping you from getting off)<br>  <br>  I'm sure that she won't say it again if you told her not too. Shes only four. But tap her on the mouth if she continues. <br>  <br>  It's not a good thing for a child to be starting,cursing.|`|AA11109728	Luckily enough, I usually only have to tell my daughter (who is also 4) once that a word is not acceptable for her to say.  After that, she knows and doesn't push it.  Give her another word to say instead (like 'fudge'), and if it happens again I'd use time out just like you might for any other unacceptable behavior.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	She loves Princess stuff so I'm assuming she has Princess items...like dress ups and toys?  I would tell her if she doesn't speak like a Princess...then she does not get to play like a Princess and take away the Princess stuff for a couple of days or however long you think is good enough to get the point across.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	my mom told me i said sh*t when i was younger and she just tapped my mouth with her finger and told me not to say it.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I introduced a new system recently. We bought a plain glass jar (Ikea's finest - lol) and a bag of plastic coins. We helped our 3 year old decorate the jar. Now, when she does something good (goes to bed like a good girl, eats all her dinner, etc) she gets a coin. When she's naughty, we take one away. When she gets to 10 coins, she gets a small treat (a sweet of some sort), when she gets to 50, a larger treat (a cheap toy) and when she gets to 100, we'll take her out for the day, either swimming or ice skating or similar. Since introducing this, she has been the best behaved she has ever been. She looks for ways to earn more coins, like cleaning her room, or trying new foods (she actually asked to try mushrooms today so she could get a coin), and when she starts being naughty, we only have to threaten to take a coin away, and she calms down immediately. I am not anti-smacking as such, but she had been having  violent temper tantrums and I didn't want to teach violence for violence. <br>  I can't say it would definitely work for you, but it's worth a try? It works very well for us.<br>  ADD - giraffe - if you had a job, and your boss was constantly shouting at you and never so much as said thank you, you'd be the first to complain, right? Well, you'd get paid to work. A child doesn't.<br>  It works, that's the main point of it.

8t8NjjnVaa	I wouldn't buy it until your baby is here.  Many people breastfeed and feed expressed breastmilk from a bottle.  What kind of bottle is best depends on your baby.<br>  <br>  I breastfed but I wanted my baby to be able to drink my expressed breastmilk from a bottle in case I left her with a sitter or in case of an emergency.  But with my first, she wouldn't take any bottle.  We went through tons of different bottles and nipples, and she refused every single one until we tried the silicone, wide-based Playtex nipples (they look very similar to the adiri nipple).<br>  <br>  With my second daughter, she took every kind of bottle and nipple with no problem whatsoever, so there was no need to search for specific ones or order ones over the internet.<br>  <br>  It just depends on your baby.  Once your supply is established and breastfeeding is going well, then try to introduce the bottle of breastmilk.  Your baby may take the first one you offer with no problem, or he/she may be like my first and refuse it.  If your baby refuses it, try again later.  If your baby still refuses it, then try a different nipple and see how that goes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ae5106e0ddfd7ecb434859ce61fcdd18aa	I have a friend that breastfeeds and that was the only bottle she would take when she started bottles at 7 months. But, Breastflow bottles are much cheaper and work great! we use them every day! My baby actually nurses better now, before he wouldn't latch at all. <a href="http://www.learningcurve.com/breastflow?icid=ddmenu&locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningcurve.com/breastflow?...</a>  Your baby will have to use the same motions with the bottle as he would with breastfeeding. The only problem is that if you use the bottle too much, they get used to the flow of the bottle and get frustrated when the flow slows down at the breast. To help with this, always use the stage one nipples. Seperate the stage 2 nipples (the ones on the bigger bottles) they aren't marked with ones or twos. ( i didn't know that so they're all mixed up)|`|M6c0hUefaa	I bought one for my daughter before she was born and UGH, I really didn't like it. I mean, I liked the idea behind it, but it leaked so badly. At first I was only pumping about 1.5oz. and one night I had the bottle and all of it leaked out onto my kitchen floor, lol. The only positive for me was that it was shaped like a breast and felt similar, but other than that, it wasn't all that great. Especially not for 14 bucks a pop.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There's no unbiased evidence that any bottle is any less likely to cause nipple confusion that any other.<br>  <br>  They can claim that they require the baby to nurse properly, but the simple fact is all bottles drip, breasts don't.  All bottles cause some degree of negative pressure in the ear canal, breasts don't.<br>  <br>  There are ways to feed a baby other than bottles.<br>  <br>  Alternative Feeding Methods<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/alternative-feeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/alter...</a>

M6c0hUefaa	LOL..Wow, I seriously became a Dr. Browns cleaning expert. Where we lived when my daughter was a newborn, we didn't have a dishwasher, it sucked because I washed every little piece so thoroughly. We moved when my daughter was around 6 months, to a place with a dishwasher, but I still didn't use it until she was older for some reason. Now, I've been using the dishwasher exclusively for her bottles and I haven't had any of that gunk build up at all. I hate those little bristle brushes that come with the bottle, they don't even clean them, but UGH, if my daughter hadn't gotten gas with all the easier bottles, I def. would've switched, but those were the only ones that worked well for her gas. I don't sterilize mine, I guess my dishwasher does since the temperature gets so high, but really, sterilization is hardly necessary, since formula itself isn't sterile. Anyways, no tips on cleaning them more quickly, you just get better :)|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I use them...well to be fair my husband and sitter use them, but I wash them. A bottle brush seems sufficient to clean the bottle and my fingers to clean the nipple. As far as the 'straw' I get that as best as possible with the bottle and nipple brush. But I have found a huge difference between cleaning them if people don't or do rinse them as soon as the baby is done. And I honestly never have sterilized a single bottle just based on the idea that I don't sterilize my tata's before feeding the baby.|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	I do!  Man, I don't think I could've gotten thru my daughters 3 month old colic without them.  They are the only bottles I will ever use from now on.  Yes, they are a pain to clean but totally worth it.  I do not have any clues how to cut down annoying cleaning time, but we try to sterilize them once a week on the stove in boiling water as our faucet water gets scaulding hot thru the week, so we let them soak everyday in the sink in really hot water.|`|4ztXoIDKaa	I use them and Love them!  I make sure after my daughter finishes a bottle I rinse it out really well and fill it up with water till I wash them.  Don't let the formula/breast milk sit in it for a long time.  I don't have that much of a problem cleaning them.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	I wash them in the dishwasher every few days and use hot water with soap every day.  I try to keep up with the cleaning so I do not have many to wash at once which can then be very time consuming.|`|nmu6coapaa	Omg they are so anoying! Mine leak all the time too! It takes me ages to clean them too. They help with my sons colic though so I cant switch now|`|spzCEedFaa	Yes, and I hate them for that very reason.  Now that my son is older, I just want to chuck them and use something new, but I haven't actually gotten around to finding a new brand to replace them.  They were good for gas though.  Usually, what I do is take the days' bottles and let them sit in warm, soapy water until I'm ready and willing to clean them.  This way, I only have to do it once or twice a day.  Don't know if this is hygenic, but have had no problems in several months.  Baby's fine.  I sterilize them once every two days, but my Dr says it's not necessary, so I may stop. It would be nice to know which brand replaces them easily - I mean a good transition bottle without baby refusing the new kind, because I can't take this washing anymore.|`|AA11134717	I use the dr browns bottles and love them!

OQnRP6xVaa	We chose to adopt our two children (biological siblings) because we felt that we were able emotionally, financially and physically to parent children who were waiting to be adopted.<br>  <br>  Our biological children were older and about to leave home and we saw a lot of life ahead between the empty nest and retirement and felt our home would be a safe and secure environment to raise children. <br>  <br>  After contemplating the options we had we believed we would be able to provide for children already born and had little interest in creating more by way of science when there were (at the time) well over 120,000 children waiting (in the US Foster Care System) to share what we had to offer.<br>  *|`|G2auAv1Saa	It is a personal decision and is different for each person who chooses adoption.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	There are many reasons, though the most common is infertility.  When a couple is ready to start a family, but is unable to conceive and/or carry a pregnancy to term, they often choose to adopt a child to complete their family. <br>  <br>  Another reason people choose to adopt is much more philosophical.  They recognize that the world is already quite populous and there are many, many children throughout the world in desperate need of loving homes.  Rather than perpetuate overpopulation, they choose to adopt a child to complete their family.<br>  <br>  Another very common reason for adoption is marriage.  Consider that you have a child when you are 19.  The father disappears.  Several years later, you meet the perfect man.  He wants to marry you and be a father to your child.  You get married, he adopts your child, you are now one complete (and legal) family.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	The are many reasons - but by far - the biggest reason - infertility.<br>  First choice for most families is to have a child of their own - that's how nature intended.<br>  Second - most try IVF or similar.<br>  Adoption is usually way down the list - when people get desperate.<br>  Not always.<br>  But sadly - that's how it often is.<br>  And adoptees know it.|`|fboC1N7gaa	There are a number of reasons:<br>  -Some people are not capable of having biological children<br>  -Some people do not want to add to the over-population of the world<br>  -Some people want to give a derseving child a home|`|Tjr9aObNaa	For me, i don't see the point in giving birth while there are plenty of children i could love as my own.

Some parents can't conceive and adoption is the only option. Or maybe they just don't want to deal with being pregnant or going into labor so they adopt. There are a lot of reasons.|`|AA10876984	I would choose adoption because my hubby & I cannot have a biological child of our own.  But we have a tremendous amount of love to give a child and there are lots of children up for adoption that I would be honored to be their mother.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	We chose to adopt because we wanted to be parents. Sounds simple... it wasn't, but we wouldn't change a thing. Adoption is the path we chose over the endless options available in the infertility realm.

Well, then she'd wonder why. Let me rephrase that - occasionally smile and say hey when you want, but you don't have to bring up long conversations with her. You can be acquaintances

Ka52nbhNaa	WOW - what a pain!  With all of the time we spend waiting for doctors who are off schedule it is too bad that they could not squeeze you in on your appointment day!<br>  <br>  The first appointment is a consultation.  They go over your medical records, family history, that of your partner, any testing that you had done, your cycle etc . . . they might schedule more testing if they feel that you have not been through all of the fertility testing.  They might also discuss their philosophy . . . especially in light of the octuplet mom . . . .I remember our RE spent time explaining to us that he tries to minimize multiples whenever possible - that of the successful births in his practice about 30% were twins, the rest were singletons and in all of his years of practicing (about 20 years) he only had a handful of triplets and no quads . . . so if we were looking for high order muliples we should find another doctor.<br>  <br>  As to whether or not you should find another doctor, it is up to you . . . I will say that if you end up going through fertility treatments some things to consider are how much you like the doctor (success rates mean nothing if you cannot stand the doctor), the hours of the clinic as you will be in and out for testing and procedures - ours was open 7 days a week and had early morning hours for bloodwork and ultrasounds which made life easier as we were both working at the time.  Another consideration for us was whether there was any other support in place - our center offered acupuncture before and after IUI / IVF treatments, counseling, workshops, yoga, massage therapy, group counseling, couples counseling, massage therapy and a nutrionist.  You did not have to participate but it was nice to have it available.  <br>  <br>  I would consider meeting a few other doctors to be sure - it can be a long process and you want to make sure that you have the right doctor for you!<br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust to you!|`|e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	Understandably things happen that aren't always entirely in your control.  But considering the specialty of this doctor and how highly recommended he comes, his schedule it probably very full, meeting as many people he can in a given day.  That being said, even 10 minutes may have diluted his time down to where he wouldn't have been able to make any formidable observations in your case.  Rescheduling the next day is a great consideration on their part.  That shows me that they are trying to get you in.  Doctors in specialized fields as this often have their schedules set very tightly, so cut him a little slack, he just wants to make sure that he can spend enough time with you during a visit to get a sound knowledge of your situation.  As frustrating as it is having to drive the distance again, and possibly without your husband this time (as he already has to re-work his schedule to attend with you), you must remember the doctor's qualifications and the recommendations you've had about him.  Hang in there, and try to be as pleasant as possible, it will make things work out best in the long run.  Good luck with your visit!  (P.S.  I would check the tire pressure, oil and fuel level this evening.)|`|xwZKouCIaa	ok honey first of all take a deep breath....... secondly these things happen as you can see this is a very busy doctors office so he;s probably a VERY GOOD doctor probably the best thing for you right now so o i dont think you should not have a visit with this doctor just because he asked you to reschedule, even if it was because of a flat tire, these  things happen thast life somethings r just unfair, but you owe it to yourself to give this doctor a try and who knows maybe one day when your finally holding ur baby in your arms one day you'll say it was all worth it..|`|af357a71c25eaeb1c68fbbea2e1a3560aa	Are you mad at the doctor or at yourself for being late?
LKIhUMCgaa	i'm 6ft and was 140lbs before pregnancy, now 30 weeks pregnant and weigh 170lbs, so so far i've gained 30 lbs.<br>  <br>  EDIT: why the heck do i get thumbs down for telling how much i've gained? i didn't know that telling bout my personal experience was wrong...|`|zSABr7praa	I'm only 19 weeks and i've gained 20.  I quit smoking when I found out I was pregnant and gained 15 pounds in 3 weeks (no exaggeration!)  My doctor said if I can stay at this weight for another 6 weeks, i'll be right on track.  I'm not worried about it.  I was 120 pre-pregnancy, and wouldn't be too heart broken if I gained 60.. as long as the baby is healthy!<br>  <br>  I worked with a woman who gained 103.. yikes!|`|TljXiSNnaa	I am 15 weeks and i lost about 12 pounds so far...but i may have a thyroid problem!!!

I'm hovering around 40.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I'll be 40 weeks tomorrow and I've gained 24 as of last thurs.....Also, I was told the average should be 25-35lbs.  You shouldn't worry about weight gain while  you're pregnant though, just eating healthy and drinking lots of water and taking your vitamins.  I know its hard not to worry about it though, the less weight you put on it seems the easier it will be to get back to normal, huh?  I can't wait to be myself again....Also, your pre pregnancy weight and the weight you have gained sounds normal to me.  I started at 156 and now Im 180 and am 5'7"|`|5DJcir9saa	I gained just almost 50 lbs but the bulk of it was definitely water weight because it just about all came off immediately after I had the baby.  Just eat healthy--lots of fruits and veggies--and move around as much as possible.

My baby is 5 months old|`|kgE96Nhcaa	You are considered right on the borderline with your pre-pregnancy weight BMI of normal weight and overweight.  Normal weight should gain 25-35 pounds, overweight should gain 15-25 pounds.  You will probably gain about a pound a week near the end of your pregnancy putting you right where you should be.  You are fine!  Make sure you are eating nutritious and taking your prenatals!|`|JvcJs8k9aa	i am 26 weeks & compared to all these other answers, i feel like i haven't gained anything! as of 22 weeks, i had only gained 4 pounds. my doctor has yet to say anything about it yet, so i guess i'm ok!|`|tQPvv0Glaa	My first 2 pregnancies I gained 50 pounds each time.

Except maybe a little Vaseline, that clear stuff that makes your lips, lashes, and cheeks shiny.|`|p4P24vtYaa	At that age i suggest none. <br>  The use of makeup now will do no good to their skin. <br>  Though it depends if it's a play, pantomime or something and a child has to dress up.|`|4m6vetjNaa	It all depends on the colours you use...

I'mma be blunt here.<br>  <br>  Make-up is not intended for children. It can be very insulting to tell your daughter that she needs to put a mask on that makes her look prettier. However. If it's her interest, tell her that she is beautiful just the way she is. Tell her, that she doesn't need make-up.<br>  <br>  Let her dabble in your make-up one day. Just for fun.

kIpDDVc9aa	I don't think you're pregnant. If you're pregnant, you shouldn't be getting your period. It probably was just the same cycle as the 2.14 one, went away for just a while, and came back. Irregular maybe. I get mine like once every three months.|`|S5n5Za78aa	some times the cycles do that but i dont think your preggo your fertile period occurs about 10-24 days after your period its different for everyone but its not common to concieve the 1st 5 days after your period
ZEYEmYRtaa	I just wanted to wish u lots of luck and hope u get your positive test<br>  BABY DUST x|`|af357a71c25eaeb1c68fbbea2e1a3560aa	You get your period 2 weeks after ovulation if you are not pregnant.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Well, actually an egg is usually only viable for about 12 hours after it is released, 24 hours at most. And you don't get your period until 14 days after that. No offense, but maybe you should become more educated and a woman's body and the reproductive system and you might have an easier time getting pregnant.
TXddP0uxaa	I can understand being frustrated that people do not seem to respect your lifestyle choice.  You need to realize though that by your own admission (you said "ALMOST definately"), there is a chance, however small, that you may change your mind some day.  My guess is, that your family and friends realize that too.  Your age also works against you.  Those of us who are older and (possibly) wiser know how many changes in maturity and attitude go on between the ages of 20 and 30.  You may want something totally different in 10 years.  Or maybe not.  Who knows?<br>  <br>  In the meantime, let these seemingly closedminded attitudes from family and friends just roll off your shoulders.  They don't mean any harm.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I have a friend who feels just like that and I support her 100%! If it hadn't been for some fateful "accidents" I would still be child free and that's what I always planned on. I didn't plan to ever have children and I was always told I would change but I didn't. I just happened to get pregnant anyway. It's totally a valid choice but don't expect people to support you because most people just don't get it. As far as finding a partner who doesn't want kids I'm sure you can just be patient. Or find one who's kids live with their mother most of the time. Lol.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I have a friend who kind of feels the same way you do except she doesn't even think kids are cute. She does like mine though. I tease her about it but really if you don't want them don't have them. It's not fair to the kids so be happy in your choice and ignore others that try to bring you down.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	I too do not want kids, I'm only 17, soon to be 18, but I know that I will never want kids.  Sounds silly, but I have already found the one for me and he also doesn't want children so it's perfect.  My problem is that my mom really wants grandkids and my brother is never going to suffice for that, and who knows about my lil sis, so she has pretty much rented out my uterin space because she wants to see me with little ones of my own.  It's a pain in the ****, but I deal with it.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Nothing wrong with not wanting kids. Some people are not cut out to be parents but do well with kids. You have to be willing to give up a lot. I'm sure you will always hear that you should have kids. I have a friend who is 31 and never wanted kids and knew that since high school and been with her husband since high school and he feels the same. She still to this day hears you should have children just cause she is so good with them.|`|xpstigPTaa	You will find that right guy, don't worry..and as for other people, don't worry about them and don't listen to them. I am pregnant now and very happy about it but that doesn't mean that other people should want the same things from life that I do. Just continue setting goals and reaching them and don't worry about how other people think you should live your life...the key words there are YOUR LIFE, not theirs. best of luck to you hun!!!!!|`|v7hkYRDLaa	Most men who want to marry, want kids, but most who don't want to marry have no interest in kids. This will be a difficult issue for you when you reach 27. Almost all men under 30 are more interested in dating than kids and want to wait to marry. <br>  <br>  At some point you may have to use online dating services to help you specifically target men who want to marry, but don't want kids. This group will be small in number. <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with you for not wanting kids. It's a great choice for you. But biology makes many so many of desire children that your situation will most likely be an obstacle. As far as people harrassing you, my wife and I waited until we were married 10 years before adopting and so many people asked us obtrusive questions before hand, it got to be annoying. I use to answer, we are either going to opt to not have kids or one day we will adopt, but your comments are not appreciated. Having children is a personal decision that I only discuss with my spouse and closest family members.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	I'm 21, I don't want kids, and I've been with a man who shares my view on the subject for over two years. People still tell me that I'll change my mind, but everytime I think about kids I just know that they aren't for me. I generally just smile and nod when older people say it, let them think whatever they want. I think you'll find a guy who doesn't want kids (they really aren't all that uncommon).|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Just smile and nod when they tell you that someday you'll feel differently.  You may, or you may not.  Either way, it's your business and your choice.  You get to live your life however you want to live it.

Our son was born one month before I turned 31. So don't worry it's your life. If people won't listen, just don't tell them. When they ask just keep it short and sweet...say I'm young,unmarried and I can't predict the future the end|`|89BVILpzaa	Plenty of people out there that don't want children or don't care either way.<br>  Neither my partner nor I wanted children. No one really asks or expresses an opinion about this. I have met with reactions similar to yours though it is becoming increasingly common for people not to have children or to leave it until very late (post 30). esp those from a similar social and educational background to my own.<br>  <br>  I have 2 sisters, neither of them have children either.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	I agree with you. (I'm 20 too) as for the partner. good luck with that. Every guy I seem to find wants kids! Ugh!!! its agonizingly irritating|`|PJBjllsVaa	i don't doubt that there are good guys out there who don't want kids so i don't think that will be a problem. as for what other people think don't let it bother you. because you are of a younger age they may not take you seriously when you say you don't want kids. i think a lot of people have this idealistic notion about women that when they 'grow up' find the 'right' guy and get married and all that happy horse manure that the woman will change her mind about having kids. that's not always the case and EVERY woman has the right to make that choice. don't let it bother you just ignore them. the best advice that i EVER give is opinions are like A**holes everyone has one and they ALL stink!|`|bspRfskYaa	I think it is completely your choice and you shouldn't be judged by anyone for your decision.  My auntie never wanted children (she was a nanny), she and her husband were quite happy on their own in their nice quiet, tidy house - she accidentely got pregnant aged 38 and was absolutely devastated, of course she came around to the idea and is now very happy with her little girl.<br>  <br>  I just hope that you find someone with the same views as you on children as it is the type of thing that can break up a relationship if you have different views on having kids.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that I would worry about if i made that decision is that i would be alone in old age with no close family to visit me - i suppose that's quite a selfish idea but maybe food for thought?<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide, don't take peoples narrow mindedness too seriously.|`|eB75qgcaaa	i suggest if you want to find a guy who doesn't want kids is to eat a lot of pp&j sandwiches the men who dont want kids are really into that|`|kNbfJry0aa	I knew at a young age that I didn't want kids. I am 38, and I am married to a man who also doesn't want kids. I hate it when people say stuff like, "some people just aren't cut out to be parents." It's not that I wouldn't be a good parent. I would. I just don't want to. Honestly, it sounds awfully dull to stay at home with a being who can't take care of itself and has to rely on you for everything. Ew. Because I don't have kids, I have my career and my life, and it's all mine! Day to day, my husband and I can do whatever we want. We don't have to worry about getting a babysitter or having enough money to travel. If we change our minds, we can adopt. There are enough kids in the world as it is. We don't need to feed our egos by duplicating our DNA. <br>  <br>  It can be hurtful when others want you to conform to something that you don't feel. For example, my boss (who didn't have kids) said that some day I will regret not having them. She said this because SHE regrets not having them. I am not her. And if I end up regretting it, so be it. Everyone regrets something in life.<br>  <br>  People have always said the same to me: that I will change my mind. I'm almost 40 and I still feel the same way about kids. Not for me. Plenty of other people are populating the planet. Like you, I am bothered when others aren't openminded about my decision. It's like they can't imagine that some women don't fit the mold. It just bothers them, I think. They don't understand it. It doesn't compute. But yet, women like us are out there! Just hang in there. And if you really don't want kids, use birth control!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cwqkbp49aa	supposed to be around a year, from what I was told.  But I think this varies widely.  However, I don't think it really changes from darker (brown) to lighter (sky blue).  I think it is usually lighter to darker shades (blue to darker blue or green, or brown).<br>  <br>  For all of you who gave me a thumbs down, you may want to read this:<br>  <br>  "The darker colors tend to dominate, so brown tends to win out over green, and green tends to win out over blue."<br>  <br>  "Most babies are born with blue eyes that can darken in their first three years. Darkening occurs if melanin, a brown pigment usually not present at birth, develops with age. Children can have completely different eye colors than either of their parents. But if both parents have brown eyes, it's most likely that their children also will have brown eyes."|`|AA11210211	It can change up until they are 5 yrs even later in some cases.My cousin's eyes didn't settle on a color until she was almost 6 yrs old, but both of my children's eyes are still the same as when they were born but that is my eye color too soo and they are 3 1/2 yrs and 1 yr.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	The average is 9 months to a year.

(She's 7 months). I know that my sister's son was born with bright blue eyes, and his eyes started to go a green color when he was around 1 yr. It varies.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	I think it varies.  I asked my doctor if my son's eyes would stay blue and she said probably, since he is 5 months old.  I think they can change for up to a year, though!|`|vjsT8DMIaa	they say 6 months...but at 6 months my sons eyes were so very blue....and then at 1 year old they were hazel...and now at 2 he's got my eye color....a honey brown color.|`|0TCFrA7iaa	i think its around three or four months
NPmRmnG6aa	I am 29 weeks also and on this weekend I really cleaned my kitchen. I cleaned behind my stove and fridge. I scrubbed the floors. Then I went to my bedroom and picked that up. I also got the babies closet they way I want it. I did all this and still did 5 loads of laundry all in one day. Today I painted our hallway and started painting polka dots i the babies room. I also cleaned out a closet in our home office. I usually really lazy during the day. I get a few loads a laundry done but usually my but is on the couch watching some tv.|`|p3d3E75oaa	its ok I done that like twice already, and I'm 34 weeks|`|alXAjdKUaa	I was nesting at 29 weeks! It was insane. Dust was my sworn enemy.. so I was dusting every five minutes. I'm now 35 weeks and it has gotten worse. But, I love to clean so it's no biggie =]|`|ibR8TkDiaa	that's normal your probably anxious for your little one to be here.congrats
FLEXqVoiaa	They already had their clearance this year, sorry! It may be different in other parts of the country, but here the big beginning of the year clearance started in early January and at this point everything that wasn't sold has been shipped off to discount retailers and to the manufacturers.<br>  <br>  They usually have a store wide clearance, including a lot of baby stuff, just after the first of the year. This clears out extra inventory left over from the previous fiscal year and the holidays.|`|x7vTKP24aa	i live in michigan, last year around july our target had huge clearences on all their baby stuff. i forgot all about that and im glad you asked this question.... we need a new stroller
jRSXE7BTaa	Nope, you choose.. Even if he is on the birth certificate, you can choose your baby's last name. You will fill out all the paper work. FYI: If you don't want him involved and don't want him on the birth certificate at all, don't tell him when you are in labor. If he is at the hospital he can try to demnd to be put on the birth certificate by paternity test so, be careful who you tell when you are in labor.<br>  <br>  You have all the rights to choose your baby's last name.|`|T9SgqPyhaa	Generally you will fill out the birth certificate, which means you fill in the baby's name, first middle and last.  It will be easier for child support if you put him on the birth certificate.  However, each state varies in its laws.  Try calling and talking to someone at the hospital who deals with the birth certificates.<br>  <br>  I know from past experience that my husband couldn't even SEE the birth certifcate until I signed off on it.  Don't let him bully you!  Even if he does get proof of paternity or you put him on the certificate, he has no right deciding the baby's name|`|cXJQq93Eaa	As a mother you have the ultimate say in the naming rights of your child if you are not married. If you are married it becomes a little stickier. While each state is probably a little different my cousin and his girlfriend had a baby and the baby has the mothers last name because the mother chose it to be that way. So check with your doctor during a prenatal visit but I am thinking YOU have the ultimate decision. Good luck to ya!!|`|gZnKQI60aa	I did some research of my own about this not too long ago for a novel I am working on.<br>  <br>  As the mother you have the legal right to select the last name of the child. It is entirely up to you what the baby's surname will be. The child's father, even if he is your husband, cannot force you to let him make this decision. You choose the name that is put on the certificate.<br>  <br>  Good luck and do not let him force you to do anything!|`|dcbf3f0dfa7ae0ae446bea315e760b58aa	Get to a lawyer that specializes in Family Law---<br>  call your local Bar Association and see if they have free "law clinics"---these are regular events with free access to a variety of lawyers (doing their required "pro bono" work) to answer questions of civil law.<br>  This should cost you nothing....|`|pTrldx2maa	Slassy is right! <br>  <br>  Mine threatened to not have anything to do with the baby UNLESS I gave his last name... Within 6 months he stopped giving a crap & now they (twins) have his last name - yet he has nothing to do with them. <br>  <br>  DO NOT LET HIM BULLY YOU.|`|Hpp26zQjaa	As the mother, YOU have the final say so of what goes on the birth certificate.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	no you get to tell the doctors what the baby's name will be so if you want him/her to have your last name go for it|`|QSodlfMraa	no he dont have any say in this, give the baby your name, he not supporting you anyways so he have no say.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	I gave my son my family name to carry on, as his father was only interested in abortion.|`|em8A42Bqaa	In some states (mine) if the guy isnt present at delivery to sign the birth certificate the baby has to have your last name.  Dont call him until it's over!  :)|`|0SIhrYCbaa	He can demand all he wants but you don't have to do anything. Its your choice and yours alone.|`|54be3c7eda2a6643c24f8ad882a635d7aa	No, he can not. Don't even tell him when you are in labor to avoid him all together. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and Congratulations on the little one!|`|AA12071655	Are you married? No? He has no rights other than what you grant him.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	hell no... you can give the baby ANY NAME YOU WANT.  he donated some semen... you've done the hard work... if you don't have his last name why should the baby?  he cannot LEGALLY make you do anything.. and DON'T let him say he won't support a child without his name... get custody and support paperwork drawn up NOW.  regardless of a name, he has to support his child...|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	You don't have to give the baby his name. If he even trys to take you to court to get the baby's name changed the judge wont grant it. Same thing happened with my daughter and her father. The Judge said my daughter could change her name if she wanted to when she turns 18.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Your baby should have your last name unless he wants to marry you. He can't bully you into anything. What a jerk. Oh, but you SHOULD put him on the birth certificate so that it will be easier for you to get child support from him.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Whatever you choose to put on the birth certificate is what the child last name is.  You can put whomever you want to as the last name and the father has no say.  Don't worry about it|`|g9ZFjl6paa	He cant tell you that you HAVE to do anything. You can give your baby your last name if thats what your wanting to do.|`|xnhwmontaa	No he cant make you! You could name the baby Dr. King Kong and he can't do anything about it lol Do what you want to do! Good Luck|`|Zln9EAhYaa	the decision is yours -- YOU are the one having the baby.|`|uLHtXibRaa	He cannot demand it if you are not marrried.Hes a big bully..dont give in to his childike tactics..|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Its your choice, he has no say. But, my fiancee's son's mom gave their son her last name, and it really upset him because it makes him feel like his son isn't really his. And her second child has the last name of the father, yet that father abandoned them by committing suicide a few days after she was born. My fiancee is the best father that he can be, yet his child doesn't have his last name...<br>  <br>  Just something to think about.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	He can't make you do that legally you have the right. I do however think that if you ever need anything from him and you know as of now that he is the father that you have to list him as such on the birth certificate, but you still can choose the last name as what ever you want...|`|AA10152451	I don't know about the 60 dollars for paternity thing, but that sounds pretty fishy. If you are the mother, than you can name the baby whatever you want and he can't have any say in it. Like others said, don't let him bully you. Name the baby what YOU want. It's yours. He sounds like just a jackdonkey.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	If you're not married, you can do whatever you want, he has no claim to the baby unless you give it to him. or he gets a court order to force a paternity test|`|F3K80HHeaa	To me, I personally think that you DON'T have to! Even though you're married, it doesn't really matter. If you dont have your baby to have his last name, it's fine! just dont put it on the certifciate.|`|dR2bqUixaa	It is up to you! If he is just a boyfriend then he doesn't really have the say, whatever you say goes. If I wasn't married then my baby would have my last name.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	No he can't make you. You can give the baby any last name you want. You could name the baby Rumplestilskin if you want. He can't do anything about it.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	you can give the baby any last name you desire, its YOUR baby!<br>  <br>  the only thing he technically has to do is give you money every month|`|tQPvv0Glaa	You can give the baby any last name you want.  Don't let him bully you.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well if you aren't married then he certainly has no rights but if you are married I'm not really sure..I bet it is still your decision.|`|NE96fU9vaa	YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT|`|04fd2039534f9759f9ec4ae1101ff131aa	You have the legal right.

AA10280194	Totally normal!!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi i had a lot of spotting in my first trimester with both mine, totally normal. =D|`|B11nrKmdaa	If you just took the test 6 days ago then it could just be a little break through bleeding. If your doctor isn't worried then maybe there isn't anything to worry about. Some women spot like that every month all through their pregnancy. If you are filling a pad an hour then that means you are hemorrhaging, you can bleed a little less than that and miscarry but it will be MUCH more than spotting! I wouldn't worry until you know there is something to really worry about. I'm sure you and your baby are both fine. Congrats!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well I never had this with either of my pregnancies but if the majority is brown then that means it is old blood.  I would trust your doctor.
qFmOuXMXaa	My daughter is 5 1/2 months old...I'm waiting till she is 6 months and then I'm taking her to get them done. If she doesn't like them when she is older then she can let them grow in. NOT A BIG DEAL!!!!!!!!!!!<br>    My oldest is 10 years old and I got her ears done when she was 10 months old and now that she is older she never wears them and I'm cool with that to.<br>     Do what you feel is right ....your only girl. I'd get them done.lol|`|9ro8fiKvaa	I agree with "Mommy & Wife". Getting your ears pierced is a personal decision that your daughter should make herself when she is old enough to understand the consequences of her decision. She needs to figure out why she wants them pierced, that it'll hurt, that there is an element of responsibility with taking care of them after they're pierced and that this is a luxury not a necessity. I also believe that she should pay for them or have them done as a special gift; whether it's a 'milestone gift' or a birthday present etc. I would feel a little taken advantage of if my mother had chosen to do something to my body permanently, that I had no say in. I was 9 when my Mom took me to the mall. I had saved up my allowance and knew what I wanted. It hurt like hell but I also knew that I had been warned about it so I accepted and lived with my decision. I love my pierced ears, was proud of myself for being brave and responsible and of my mom for trusting me to make this special decision in my life.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	I have two girls.  I have not had their ears pierced.  I think the child should be able to choose when and if they have holes put in their ears.  I got my own done when I was 9 years old.<br>  <br>  I do think that earrings on a baby girl look cute, but that doesn't benefit the baby any.  It's strictly a cosmetic thing, and your baby doesn't care if she looks cute or not.  And I'm sure she's cute regardless.<br>  <br>  My kids are now 6 & 8.  My 8-year-old, who is very very girly, has no desire whatsoever to get her ears pierced.  <br>  <br>  My 6-year-old recently told me she wanted them done on her birthday.  Closer to her birthday, she changed her mind, so she doesn't have them.  <br>  <br>  I figure that it's their ears, it should be their choice when and IF they get pierced.  <br>  <br>  Many people will come on here and say that's it's better as a baby because they won't remember it later.  I fail to see how that makes any difference.  It's not like if your child can remember it that she's going to have nightmares about it or something.<br>  <br>  All that aside, with a baby you have to worry about them pulling on them, getting them caught on their clothes, infection, etc.  There's also the risk if one comes loose that they may put it in their mouth and swallow it.  <br>  <br>  Sure the risk is low, but why put your baby at ANY risk when she didn't choose it?|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I had my little girls ears pierced at 8 weeks old, once she got all her shots. I made sure to be careful when putting her clothes on her so it wouldn't get snagged on her earrings, and I cleaned  and turned them every night till she got a little older. I never had any problems with them. She's five years old now and she loves her earrings. I would do it now so she can get used to them by the time she's a toddler. Good Luck.|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	I went back and forth on the issue also.  But I decided to get her ears pierced just this past Saturday, she cried for like a second until I distracted her attention with a bottle and some bright lights from a toy in the mall.  It was the best decision, now we never have to worry with it again and she will not remember it.  I would do it now instead of later, b/c when they get older they can stay pouty about it and be upset longer.  Good luck and you'll be glad you did it now.  It is a huge weight off my shoulders.|`|jKz63XCfaa	As a personal experience, I'm glad my parents let me decide when I wanted my ears pierced, I waited a long time and I enjoyed not having them pierced, of course everyone is different.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would wait until they were 5 and tell them they can have their ears pierced whenever they want to.|`|heDtLdz5aa	personally if i had a little girl i wouldn't..my sister has two girls and waited until they were both 5 to take them...my sister and her daughters enjoyed the mommy an me time excitement and loved being able to show off something new to everyone..but really it is your call..and doesn't make you a bad person if you decide to do it now...|`|7N4AtRogaa	That's a very personal decision.  I have 2 girls ages 1 and and 9 days.  We got our oldest's done when she was your daughter's age and had no complications.  Now that we have a newborn, i'm not sure if we will do them as early or not.|`|rv2PHuNPaa	a lot of peopel do it my mom waited till i was 5 so i could yell louder and say words that wernt nice. i honestly suggest you get it done when they are little becasue they don't knwo whats commign your a lot better off|`|V4cnhA0Eaa	yes of course i would and also as tradition in my family every baby girl has her ears pierced at around 7 weeks. no pain babies that age usually don't cry and don't mess with their ears|`|kB63WTfdaa	Why risk infection on a baby?  Beside isnt is a personal choice if someone wants piercing or a tattoo.|`|w3ob12X6aa	my daughter is 3 months old and im going this weekend to get hers pierced, i like it and i think its really cute.|`|OvInDcZMaa	With both of my girls I let them decide and have never regretted it.  One did the other did not (they are 28 and 17)|`|XCPctxGHaa	yes, get it pierced|`|AA11210211	I am going to go get my daughters done later this week after we get paid,She is 1 yr old and I plan to get another hole as well when we go.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	No I wouldn't. Babies don't need them IMO, they're beautiful enough anyway.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Nope. When my daughter is able to understand the responsibility of having her ears pierced, and asks for them I'll take her and we'll have a girls day so she can get her ears pierced. I don't see any reason to pierce her ears now (7months old) she's too little to understand and I don't think it's fair to her.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I got my daughters done when she was 3 months old and the reason it is better to get them when they are younger is because then they can pull on them and cause a infection, I'm glad I got my daughters done when I did and they don't bother her at all, she is almost 7 months in 2 days.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Only if my baby made a rational decision that she wanted them pierced. Since babies can't even talk, let alone make decisions about cosmetic procedures, the answer would be NO. It's her body, not yours.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I just think that it would be a hassle to turn the studs every day and keep them clean. Little squirmy girls may not sit still well for such things. But that's my opinion.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	My daughter is 6 months.  My husband wants to get her ears pierced but I'm not sure.  I want her to be the one who chooses whether or not to get it done.  My husband thinks it looks cute on little girls, but he isn't the one who has to take care of them if they get infected.  So, I'm not sure.  I'm interested to see what others say.|`|lGcpXteaaa	As a mother i will be getting my daughters done when she wants them done. As soon as she can ask for them, she will get them.<br>  I am not bothered by piercings at all, as long as they are at a legal age with my consent...they can get them done.<br>  But i would not get it done without my daughters consent either...Shes a baby and i like her to stay that way! I couldn't put her through unnecessary pain either.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just to add something i didnt mention before....I would never think somebody was a bad mother if their baby had theirs done. I just have a hard enough time getting my daughters jab done lol :) Its your decision at the end of the day.<br>  That and my mother had mine done when i was young and because of the growth the hole is in the wrong place now! lol I hate it! other than that i am mad on piercings too.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	I think you should wait until she's old enough to make the decision herself and mature enough to take care of it. There is enough to have to care for and worry about with a baby, so why add to it? The last thing I would need is worrying about an infection from something that is not necessary at all. With the allergies that run in my family, she'd be at high risk for an infection.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	some moms are going to say your sexulaizing your children <br>  some are going to tell u ur a bad mom <br>  some are going to ask y u would want to do that to a perfect baby <br>  <br>  but if she is your only girl <br>  and u want to id do it <br>  i think baby girls look cute with earings but i dont have a girl so im not help ful on this|`|vGxipYJnaa	I am not letting our daughters have their ears pierced until they can take care of their piercings themselves.

Just make sure you're taking vitamins and have fun trying!!!  : )<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|xwZKouCIaa	Being as tho you have been trying to concieve for eight months you might want to start with buying some opk and then talk to your doctor to see if he/she might have some insight.. best of luck to you..|`|60c23c4e75582a183b256dc1695d7638aa	Try using this website www.MyMonthlyCycles.com. Log in all your past periods and it'll tell you how long your cycle is, when you're fertile, ovulation and due for a period. I got pregnant using this site to keep track of my fertile days. <br>  <br>  Also, if you don't already, make sure you drink a lot of water. Water helps increase your fertile cervical mucus which helps carry the sperm where it needs to go. <br>  <br>  Try to have sex as much as you can or are able to during your fertile days. Lay down for 10-15 minutes after sex and raise your pelvic area on a pillow. That'll help the sperm go where it needs to and not run out when you stand up. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	The best advice I can give is try not to stress.  I know it is the hardest thing to do when ttc, but it really will make it easier.  So many people I have talked to that were ttc conceived on the months that they stopped "trying".  Also make sure you are taking your vitamins and so is your partner.  I take multi vitamins, plus a extra drop of Folic Acid.  Try to stay away from caffeine and smoking.  Oh....and I take Primrose Oils for my skin, but they also help with Cervical Mucus and making it more abundant.  But only take it up to O date and then stop.  It can cause contractions and complications if you take it while pregnant.  Good Luck:)|`|FLOjzbKEaa	just have sex as much as you can and enjoy it.  I am sending you Lots of Baby Dust on your way.
3EhoJ42zaa	With contractions and going from 1-8cm isn't too bad.  It's painful but tolerable.  They feel like really bad period cramps, mixed with the feeling that you are something bad cramps, mixed with like someone is squeezing the life out of you from inside.  They stay tolerable because inbetween contractions you feel perfectly fine.  Then once you get to 8-10 cm, at the peak of the contraction you will feel like you need to push like you have to go to the bathroom.  This was a hard part for me.  The contractions are closer and lasting longer and you just feel like you need to do something toget rid of the pain.  <br>  <br>  Then there is the pushing part.  Once it is okay for you start pushing, you can literally feel the baby coming down through the birth canal.  It is the worst feeling.  You can feel your pelvis spreading as well as the contractions at the same time.  then once the baby starts to crown, it starts burning, but you need to keep pushing.  It hurts because you can feel every time the baby moves lower and lower.  (basically like your mom said, like my insides were coming out) THen all of a sudden you feel the shoulders pass through, then the baby slides out and your belly kind of collapses and you can breathe again.  Then you don't feel anymore pain at all.  It is the worst pain I have ever felt, but I'd do it again.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	lol child birth naturally is obviously not as bad or women would stop at one baby., i had 2 naturally and with virtually no pain relief and would do it again in a heart beat. yes it hurts but i forgot the pain the minute my boys were born. every womans pain threshold is different.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I would say the worst pain that you will ever experience, but with saying that, it is also the best day of your life, so the two kinda cancel each other out....no matter how bad the pain is, you know you are working to get your baby here, and that just makes it easier to get through.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	It was painful, but not unbearably painful.  If I had to chose between running a 5K race, and natural childbirth then I'd go for the childbirth any day.  The prize is better too.
8t8NjjnVaa	There's a ton of stuff you can do at home!  You don't need a gym, you don't need to go outside!  <br>  <br>  The first thing to do is make sure your eating habits are good.  A healthy appetite is fine.  Satisfying your appetite with cookies is not.  Keep lots of fresh fruit around.  It's sweet, it's healthy, it's low-calories, and it's got fiber to fill you up.  <br>  <br>  Also be sure to drink plenty of water.  <br>  <br>  For exercise, pilates and yoga are great for toning the tummy muscles.  You can buy a video or catch some episodes on TV to record.  <br>  <br>  Kickboxing is great for cardio and burning calories and building strength in your arms and legs.  Again, you can buy a video or record episodes on TV.  <br>  <br>  You could also pick up a treadmill at a garage sale.  You can usually get a good one for about $100.  <br>  <br>  On TV, there's a program called "In Shape with Sharon Mann".  Record all her episodes for a week or two, and try them out.  Keep ones you like and delete the others.  I liked her kickboxing routine and her Pilates ones best.  <br>  <br>  For the most part, you need no equipment for this.  For yoga, you can do it directly on carpet, or if you have tile/wood, you can either get a mat, or just toss a blanket onto the floor.<br>  <br>  Kickboxing requires no equipment at all.  If you want to increase the intensity, you can add handweights if you want to.|`|UEAzzroAaa	If you have the funds, but a treadmill! Thats what i did (though i never use it, haha useful huh) LOL Or if you have stairs, run up and down them for a half hour! Boring yes but it will work!|`|9ro8fiKvaa	If you are breastfeeding then just know that your body only requires 500 extra calories per day (my nutritionist told me this). For exercise walk walk walk. I assume that you have a stroller so pop your oldest one in it and 'carry' your baby. I did all my groceries in the stroller when I was off on mat leave and burned off loads just by walking everywhere. Also, I know that it'll take some childcare planning but if you have someone that can look aftetr the kids in the evening when they are in bed, steal an hour or two for yourself and go swimming! It's cheap, great exercise and will be gentle on your joints. It also feels great for an overheated breastfeeding body!|`|AA11803994	Your situation sounds A LOT like mine! :) My husband and I have 2 children and I live in an apartment. I weighed 145 before I had my first child and after my second I weigh 155-158. I work full-time and when I am at home, I spend time getting the kids ready for their baths and bed. So, needless to say I don't have a lot of time to go to a gym or the apartment work-out room. Unfortunately, I live in an apartment so I can't have a treadmill because I am on the 2nd floor and it would be too loud and I have no room.<br>  <br>  If you live in a house, I definitely recommend investing in a treadmill and some weights...nothing fancy. If you are like me, jogging for about 15-30 minutes on the treadmill everyday and doing some weights will whip you back in shape.<br>  <br>  Make sure you are watching your food intake. It's ok to eat whatever you want but if you aren't exercising then it becomes a problem. Right now I am at 150 and holding. I cut back on the amount of cokes I drank and I cut back on buying cookies at the store. I buy fruit and whipped cream for the kids and its healthy for me too. However, you can only cut back so much on food...then it becomes a body toning issue. You need to work out to tone your body to help lose those last pounds and tighten up your stomach and legs. It's a combination of watching some of what you eat and toning your body and working out.<br>  <br>  It's hard to lose weight after the second baby because you don't have a lot of time and energy but YOU CAN DO IT. Try to committ to working out in your home for one hour 3 days a week (no specific days because it's hard to plan) and go from there....make a music CD and ask your husband to help keep you motivated. Put the baby in his car seat or rocker and let him watch you.. or do it while the kids nap if you can get them on the same schedule. It just takes a lot of self-discipline but it sounds like you are motivated to work it out! :) Best of luck!!! :)
hQPf1PRsaa	Taryn's :D WAY cute girl...<br>  :DDD <br>  Faye is my Aunts name... <br>  if me and my husband plan on having any more Children, if we have a girl her middle name will be Faye. :D <br>  <br>  I absolutely love Isabella but, i liked the H after it.. :D it made it a little different! <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck|`|dTPg4uYzaa	Its a really pretty name i think Tarryn is nicest spelling|`|FmC1TGm5aa	It's very pretty. I like the Isabella-Faye.|`|L1DUcTtSaa	Yeah, i like isabella-faye the most.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	well it is your baby so it is your decision.  I only like Isabella and Faye b/c of the meaning behind it.  I don't care for Taryn at all though.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i love it and the spelling just the way you have it looks great.  my daughters name is Issabella, little different from yours i put 2 s's in her name.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Taryn is one of my favourite names!! :)<br>  The whole name together sounds beautiful :)|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I love it! Sounds like my sons name, Torin.|`|Chib4b8saa	If you want honesty, I do not like the name. Taryn is just too old sounding for a baby and I knew a lady named Taryn who was a complete mental case, no offense! But she's your baby, so choose what name makes you smile when you say it over and over. I love Isabella, because you could call her Bella for short.|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	I love it!  It is unusual.  I like it spelled the way you originally have it.  Nice choice.|`|AA10152451	Taryn is a beautiful name and out of the alternate spellings you listed I think Taryn is the best. I definitely love it!!|`|vjsT8DMIaa	Taryn is beautiful!!! I love the name!! :) Congrats on your baby girl on the way!!|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Unique name.. I like either Taryn or Tarryn|`|bkYQCPH7aa	the name is gorgeous, but i especially like the spelling Tarryn!|`|3255bf9a56942506a066812fff721579aa	Beautiful name!<br>  I like Tarynn, with two n's :)|`|vhMe2oCGaa	I love the name its my god mothers name.  but i like the spelling with the double r <br>  good luck and conrgrats
8t8NjjnVaa	You can't wake her up during the day long enough to change her schedule around.  Trying to do that will only cause stress and tears on both of you.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your baby has night and day mixed up.  In the womb, there was no difference between night and day, so this is normal for babies to be on an opposite schedule.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is let her naturally transition.  You can help it along by making day and night very different for her.  During the day when she's sleeping, don't turn volume on the tv or radio down, don't tell other kids or adults to keep quiet.  Keep all the blinds open (even in the baby's room), run the vacuum, whatever you normally would do during the day.  <br>  <br>  When you are nursing/giving a bottle during the day, keep it lively.  Talk to her in an excited voice.  Play with her, interact as much as possible.  Don't try to force her to stay awake, but do interact with her while she is awake.<br>  <br>  At night, don't turn the lights on when she wakes up.  Keep voices and other sounds low.  Don't talk to her in an excited voice.  When she wakes up to nurse/drink a bottle, feed her, but don't interact with her otherwise...don't play with her or talk to her excitedly.<br>  <br>  Do this and your baby will naturally see the difference between night and day and will begin to transition to being awake more during daytime hours.  It may take a little while, and the transition itself is usually slow, so don't expect this to happen overnight.|`|pXSKSS3daa	"do any parents have good advice that works?"<br>  <br>  Yes. Relax. This is totally normal because newborns have their days and nights "mixed up" for some time. She'll sort them out on her own so just let her be. Don't try forcing her to stay awake because she's still quite young and that could lead to over stimulation and her being overly tired. Both of those result in a very fussy baby.<br>  <br>  Give her a couple more months and then you can try implementing a bedtime routine and playing with her "schedule" more. For now, just let her adjust to her new world.|`|cO10vvWsaa	my baby is 5 weeks today and she seems to never sleep! at night she is almost always awake. In the beginning she would sleep more.|`|EhGR05Etaa	Don't let them sleep too deep throughout the day.  Give them a little nudge every couple minutes to make sure they get some sleep but because it's so easy for babies to mix up day and night....you don't want them to DEEP sleep during the day.  However 4 weeks maybe a little early to start this....babies that young have to sleep a LOT....good luck
PBY9MNDFaa	Best time is usually first thing in the morning, however any sex is good sex if you are ovulating.  Lying on your back, with your hips and legs raised is recommended to allow the sperm to swim in the right direction too.  <br>  <br>  I'd definitely say that a 'normal' amount of sperm is what your partner has, not what you see in the movies.  Most of these films exaggerate the amounts for the camera.|`|f066bc63dc201d9ff49cf81de2f92a07aa	I would say eve|`|VjlHgKEkaa	I would say wait about 24hrs. just to be in the safe side.

zKEgGwhxaa	I would go ahead and start now.  But don't decorate the room in neutral colors just because you can't wait to find out... if you really want a little girl or boy themed room, just wait to start painting.  There are other things you can get ready before you know what you're having.  Also, there are places that do ultraounds (not at your normal doctor or OBGYN) that do gender determination ultrasounds at 17 weeks.  We have a place near us called Becoming Mom, and we had ours there at 17 weeks.  I don't know how we waited that long, I guess just because we didn't have a choice!  It is so exciting to hear what that little baby is going to be, and then go out and buy stuff for it!  I would check it out and see if there is a place like that near you, then you could find out next week.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I am 29 weeks and today I started painting pink polka dots in my little girls room. I got one wall done and still have a lot more to do. We do not have a crib yet, I think my grandma may be getting us one.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I guess we started sometime around the middle to end of my second trimester. We would have put it off some, but we knew our family would want to see it done when we hosted them for Christmas.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I'm 19 weeks tomorrow and I was anxious too.  I figured I'd get neutral colors but then decided that I like my options better if I know what I'm having (Wednesday...yay!).  What I did do is get my crib and changing table and my mother bought me a bassinet/playpen thats Winnie the Pooh (neutral colors).  I bought a few neutral outfits and by then I'd gotten enough out of my system to wait on other things.  My husband caught the feeling and bought his car seat/stroller...I won't because I want to know the sex but this nutcase bought it to match the interior of his truck (gray)  LOL.|`|RJ8Jf73Vaa	We started as soon as we found out. I was about 11 weeks along. We looked for a neutral color to paint the nursery and picked out the crib, changing table, and dresser pretty much right away. We are almost all done with EVERYTHING and still have 11 weeks left! It was a lot more fun to start early because we didn't/don't feel rushed! After you find out the sex, you can pick out clothes and bedding! Good luck and congrats!|`|yPNvecc7aa	I did everything between 20-25 weeks.<br>  But by 16 weeks I had started buying some clothes. So if you're antsy, you can start by doing that!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	As soon as we found out what we were having.

nfzQkvqraa	She's a beautiful woman.  But that isn't what matters.  I think it's sort of gross to assume that your children might get scared because the woman is missing an arm.  We are all different. We all look different. And trying to get someone off the air because they don't have 2 full arms is really sending children the wrong message.  Wow. It really annoys me.  Good for her for having wonderful self esteem and having a full career despite her "disability."  I really hope these parents stop being so insensitive and close minded.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	While it's dreadful that some parents would complain about this, we need to look at the numbers.<br>  <br>  There have been a whole nine complaints. I'd suspect that the BBC get more than that if a presenter's tie is crooked. I know they had FAR more than that when they accidentally broadcast a few seconds of a non-bleeped version of an article a few weeks back very early in the morning, even though it was instantly cut and the presenters immediately apologised for the mistake. Some people are professional complainers.<br>  <br>  I mean, it was the Paralympics not so very long ago. Did those same parents complain when little Ellie was on the news? Their kids might have been scared that maybe they wouldn't grow tall either. What about Blade Runner the sprinter - should he be banned because they might be scared of him?<br>  <br>  I strongly suspect that the only people who have complained are trolls.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	Personally I think it's disgusting that someone would complain about this.  God made us all different and we are all beautiful, my son is two and that is exactly what he will be told.  I worked with disabled people for three years and the one thing I learnt is that they would rather be spoken to about their disability than have people pretend they can't see them.  I read in one article that the parent in question thought their daughter would have nightmares.  I used to have nightmares about the iron, not burning me, not falling on me, just not being able to take the wrinkles out of the clothes.  My sister had a nightmare that Tweety Pie was having a party in the garden and wouldn't go back to sleep until my dad went out and picked up the rubbish that had fallen out of the bin during the storm that night.  Should Tweety Pie and mothers ironing in front of their children have been banned?  I'm horrified that any parent could be so narrow minded and say such a thing about anyone, but I suspect these are the parents raising our future ASBO achievers|`|ampkZtrXaa	It is not the missing arm that scares me, it is modern childrens television! Bring back Biddy Baxter!|`|YwOLE88Gaa	i read this so called article, i have an 18 month old who watches C-beebies and when i noticed this new presenter i thought good for her and them for employing her despite her disability . her disability is not 'scary' children need to learn that not everyone is the same and that people with disabillities should be accepted, i think these parents are ridicoulous in these claims and it is them that are more scared of her than the children!. kids are very honest and most will not have even noticed that she has a disability and even when they do they will be more curious than scared. i hope these parents realise they are setting the wrong example by not exposing there children to the real world.|`|3c999cc5b0b1a321de8a3f065f0fab47aa	The fact that your 6 year old twisn, who at 6 would notice and comment on anything that they thought remotely 'wrong', havn't noticed shows 1. the good parenting they've had, you have obviously shown no prejudice or made anyone with a disability stand out, and so they see nothing out of the ordinary, and 2. that the simple, common thing as a missing limb, is not disgusting/scarey/freaky and just a fact of life and no different to having different raced people on the tv<br>  <br>  These people who are complaining are just narrow minded and are the ones with the problems and not the children, although sadly with parents like that, they're breeding another generation of narrowminded humans. <br>  <br>  Why can people not see that no matter what we look like, what colour we are, how we speak etc, that we are all human beings, we were all made the same way, all arrived the same way and all leave the world the same way....we are all equals|`|VeuJB4lEaa	i heard a lady on the radio, and its appaling....why not have a host with one arm, why is she any different, i didnt notice until the other day but it didnt bother me, shes still a human being and there are a lot of children out there with disabilities...makes me angry that someone can be so ignorant!!<br>  <br>  putting this a side aswell, what has happend to chris and pui!!??|`|KDNWFuZWaa	that's exactly what I said. I have always found young children to be understanding enough not to be bothered by anything like that especially if they are keeping them amused or being nice to kids. children are not normally bothered unless the parent is.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Wow- that is horrible of those parents who have complained. <br>  Children usually aren't the ones to notice 'disabilities' like this, and if they usually do not react by 'fright' (unless it is a burn victim or other very disfigured person they shouldn't be frightened). The children's reaction is very reflective of the parent. The woman who noted this effected her child's sleep needs to learn how to speak with her children about people being different. <br>  I definitely see this as a parenting problem.|`|AA11210211	That is just sad,I don't think it would scare child it would make them curious,at least that is the affect my cousin has on people,She was born without her left hand,all she has is a little stub for a thumb and the rest looks like knuckles,whenever another child sees her hand they ask her what happened they aren't scared of her.I think that lady is hateful.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	No matter how long its been since you have stopped breastfeeding you can start again, adoptive moms who have never been pregnant sometimes induce lactation.  The milk doesn't "go bad" in your breasts.<br>  <br>  1) How do you know your milk didn't come in?<br>  2) Were you using bottles?<br>  3) Were you using formula?<br>  <br>  If your baby was latched on properly and truly nursing on demand and you didn't make enough milk then you need to get some tests done including thyroid function, iron levels, and insulin (PCOS and diabetes).  It would also be wise to speak to a specialist such as a "plastic" surgeon if you suspect your breasts aren't "normal", conditions like tubular breasts can prevent milk production.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/13still_more_bf_myths.html#12" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/13still_m...</a><br>  12. If the baby is off the breast for a few days (weeks), the mother should not restart breastfeeding because the milk sours.<br>  <br>  Not true! The milk is as good as it ever was. Breastmilk in the breast is not milk or formula in a bottle.<br>  <br>  -------------<br>  Relactation and Adoptive Breastfeeding: The Basics<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/relactation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/relact...</a><br>  <br>  Help -- My Baby Won't Nurse! <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby/back-to-breast.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...</a><br>  <br>  Is your milk supply really low?<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-supply.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...</a><br>  <br>  Weaning from formula supplements<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/decrease-formula.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/decrea...</a><br>  <br>  "My Baby Just Doesn't Get It"  <br>  <a href="http://www.normalfed.com/Help/babyget.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.normalfed.com/Help/babyget.ht...</a>|`|8t8NjjnVaa	Absolutely!  You don't just dry up all of a sudden.  <br>  <br>  But please remember that the herbs are not a cure-all.  They won't just make you start producing a bunch of milk.  You body still needs the stimulation of the baby (or pump) at the breast to know it needs to make milk.<br>  <br>  It may take a little work to get your supply back up, but since it's only been days (not months) it shouldn't take too long.  <br>  <br>  Try to get your baby to nurse for as long as possible.  Then offer formula if she's still hungry.  While you are giving her formula, pump.  You may not get much out, and that's fine.  It's all about stimulating milk production.  <br>  <br>  Store whatever you do get out in the refrigerator.  The next feeding, again, put the baby on the breast first.  Then offer any expressed breastmilk you have in the refrigerator and formula if need be.  Pump while you are feeding that to the baby.<br>  <br>  Within a few days, you will notice that the baby is taking in less from the bottle after being on the breast.  That's because the baby will be getting more from the breast.<br>  <br>  After the baby seems content after just being on the breast, you can stop giving her formula altogether.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Yep! But they are not a magic bullet, you need to nurse the baby as often as possible and even try pumping to keep yourself constantly stimulated!<br>  Do lots of skin to skin and hot compresses!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|dTPg4uYzaa	i heard that too but im not sure i think that if you take the herbs it will help produce more milk i dont think it matters how long after you have stopped|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Yes you can. Milk is made on supply and demand. The best thing to do is put your baby at the breast every time he/she seems hungry or instead of a pacifier. The more stimulation you have the better your milk will come back. Drink some mothers milk tea, 4 tea bags to one pitcher of water. I brew it before bed and stick it in the fridge for iced tea the next day. Drink the whole thing over the day. Eat some oatmeal and nurse, nurse, nurse. <br>  <br>  My son is 11 months old and I have been in the process of weaning some. He got a stomach bug last week and only wanted to nurse, no solids at all. My milk supply jumped a ton in only 3 days so it doesn't take long to see some results if you nurse often.<br>  <br>  Only supplement after you offer the breast.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes u can try the herbs and stuff but he may not want it so idk

AA11327039	Maybe a  seizure but only if he's really tired and wants to sleep afterward.<br>  <br>  Sometimes loud noises will set off a seizure as will the fuzzy snow screen on the television. Fast blinking lights have been known to set off seizures too.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's just daydreaming?<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|jgYhKaACaa	take him to the doctor but if it was a seizure then he wouldn't be blinking, the are called staring seizures.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I honestly have NO idea if anything I'm telling you is remotely correct, but I was watching Mystery Diagnosis one day, and this little boy (I believe his name was Eamon) had some of the same symptoms as your son, and it turned out he had Celiac Disease.. Basically, it requires that one maintains a gluten-free diet because it creates a toxic reaction...|`|VWAdVZ43aa	ITS NORMAL<br>    EVEN IF IT AINT NORMAL HE WONT DIE
AA12228565	Wow... that's a tough one.  I really think that honesty is the best.  You can explain to him that he's dads not a bad guy he just made some wrong choices.  ect.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	you should not tell your child. you should not tell only because his father is not active in the child's life. Your son has not seen him in 3 months. If you haven't been updating him on his father's life then there's no reason to start now.<br>  <br>  his father will have a chance to be involved with his son at some other point. don't burden your son with the news. just let your son assume that his father is out doing whatever it is that he does.|`|oojO4WAraa	No, just tell him Daddy is going away for a while.  You don't have to tell him why or where.|`|UADLdXBtaa	Kids are so impressionable that if he tells people his dad is in jail, he will forever be compared to him and made fun of for it. If he could keep it to himself that is one thing, but if not then I wouldn't tell him the whole truth. Since he's having problems with stealing, I would definitely make sure that the kid knows that the reason he can't see his dad for a year is that he stole something that didn't belong to him and he got in big trouble and he had to move away. I wouldn't consider it "lying to your kid" because sometimes kids just don't need to know the whole truth. Give him the basics, but not enough to cause him to feel bad about his dad. He may not be the best dad but he is his and it would be terrible to ruin that for him before he is old enough to understand the whole story.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I would tell my son that his dad is "going away" for a while, but not to worry because he will be back.  Are you going to visit him while he's in the slammer?  After a visit it might be easier to explain.  He might ask "why is daddy in jail" or something like that, then you can explain why, and that is what happens when you do something you're not supposed to, yadda yadda, and it could be a very good lesson.  On the other hand, I have a sister who just turned 7 in Dec.  If you were to tell her that somebody is going to jail for a while she would have understood.  So, maybe you're underestimating his understanding of things?  In which case, you could tell him the truth and just tell him not to be worried, because everything will be and is fine.|`|xKLydoTpaa	you are going to have to tell him something.  and the closer it is to the truth the better<br>  <br>  tell him his daddy made a mistake and has to pay for it.  and that part of the punishment is that he can't see either of you for a while<br>  <br>  you don't want to lie to him - sooner or later he will find out the truth, better he hear it from you than from some kid at school|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I think you should. Being honest with your child is very important. He's six and I think he's old enough to understand there are consequences for your actions. <br>  <br>  ..If you don't tell him the truth,what are you going to tell him when he asks where his father is? Lie?|`|Si9hhcW1aa	I would not give out too much detail. You can let the child know that his dad is going away for a while to get some help. That he did something bad and that he will be back as soon as he can. I don't think I would tell your son what his father did.|`|ysUg2Rgraa	My best guess would be to tell him in the simplest way.<br>  I.E:<br>  <br>  "Son, your daddy did some things,bad things, and he went to a place where he can get help."|`|ntfOcTnWaa	That is pretty young to tell him, just say that he's going on a long vacation or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  Explain when he's older.|`|nndfTOo9aa	i personally would wait, til he's a bit older and would understand more.  thats just me though.|`|15qceXaOaa	I would tell him now. he'll find out eventuly and id be really mad if i wasnt told @ the time.|`|QNNOCf4Kaa	You should really think about what you are saying here. You shouldn't lie to your son because in doing so you are setting an example that it is okay to lie. Despite what people think it is never okay to lie. It's an ugly and hurtful action. When your son learns the truth, which one day he will, how do you think he will look at you? He will certainly see that you feel it is okay to lie to him. You will lose some trust letting him down and possible losing his respect. Children like to believe that their parents are people of integrity. <br>  <br>  He can learn a lot from this. His dad should be the one telling him though, not you as it was his dad who made the choice to break the law and he should have to face his son. This is where he can teach his son a very valuable lesson and keep his son's love and admiration lessening the damage that this seperation will cause.<br>  <br>  My son was told what happened even though he was only 3 years old at the time. He didn't really understand it and he was not happy with me at first because he felt that I had left him. He asked his mom if he did something wrong to make me leave. He asked her exhusband if he would be his dad because his daddy was gone. It was really hard to hear him cry on the phone and beg me to come home and all I could tell him was that I could not because I did a bad thing. As time went on our relationship healed itself and is stronger than ever. He respects me now for not lying to him and, think about this, he now has an example of how he should conduct himself when tempted to lie about something. My son is a very honest boy today. He even admits when he is wrong and accepts the consequences. I am very proud of him and will continue to raise him by setting a better example for him to follow and I am confident that he will one day grow into a man of integrity. Yes, one little white lie can bring a ton of heartache and pain. Just be honest with him and teach him, lead your son into building up a fine character by setting the right example for him. His parents can be his role model.<br>  <br>  Reliable Advice for Raising Children<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20061101/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20061101/art...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20061101/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20061101/art...</a><br>  <br>  A Child’s Early Years <br>  What Should Parents Do?<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041022a/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041022a/ar...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041022a/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041022a/ar...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041022a/article_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20041022a/ar...</a>|`|d8SJiabkaa	You are doing the right thing by not telling your child that his father is going to prison. He's too young and may not understand despite your best efforts. Telling him may not only be traumatic, but confusing. His little un-developed brain will most likely develop the idea that his daddy is a bad person and he may become afraid of him. <br>  <br>  You don't want this to happen UNLESS you fear the father is dangerous to the well-being of your child. If the charge was something along the lines of murder or assault, I would tell you to tell your child that his daddy did something bad and the police took  him to jail. Since it isn't, that isn't necessary.<br>  <br>  Be sure to tell your child that daddy is simply going away for a while and it may be hard to understand the situation. Make sure to insure your child his daddy still loves him very much and he will be back as soon as he can.<br>  <br>  I know this was a long explanation, but I hope it helped. Good luck!|`|PAC7aoBfaa	I teach 4-5 year olds and I have several students whose dads have been in prison (I know this because they talk about it in school).  If your child has a decent teacher then he/she won't allow the other kids to make fun of your child.  They respond really well to each other and are very sympathetic about it.  I think it is important to be honest even though you do not have to give him all the details.  Kids understand more than you might think and it might be a good lesson for him that punishments do happen for doing things you aren't supposed to do.  Talk to your child's teacher about it (or write a note) so he/she will be aware of what is going on.|`|f7KPRKtSaa	No, don't tell him all of that! The only thing telling your 6 year old that is father is in prison is going to accomplish is tramatizing the poor kid.<br>  Look, I'm speaking from experience, my 6 year old has a father that has been in prison for most of his young life. He knows he has a dad out there somewhere but he doesn't ask and I'm not about to tell him. If you feel you need to tell him something then tell him he had to go away for a while. That way you won't feel so much like you're lying to him and at that age even if you do lie about it it's to protect him not to hurt him. That is way too much for a six year old to have to deal with and if he's a bright kid he'll understand most of it but how well will he deal with it?|`|1UOnrM1Maa	Lying to your child is never a good thing. It teaches bad morals, and you don't want your child to lie in return.<br>  <br>  Tell your child the truth. Don't be blunt..Be willing to answer any questions, and don't get frusterated. Make sure he knows why, and make it a life lesson. <br>  <br>  How's the relationship between your son and your boyfriend? They need to be close. I have learned from experience that every boy needs a father figure, whether they wish to go into carpentry, interior design, Modeling, or business. This may be irrelevant, but you need to think of your son also, when it comes to relationships. <br>  <br>  Speaking of which..You want your ex out of your son's life forever. But I don't think it's a good idea. He needs to atleast have some kind of background. If his dad tries to contact him, please let him. Don't restrict him from having any communication with his father.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RKV4sDj9aa	What I think you should do is figure out a way to tell him that his dad did something bad and now he is in trouble and he has to go away for a while, but make sure you tell him that he will be back and he is ok. You will in the year to come be talking with people about dad. It would be better if you told him what was going on instead of him hearing it from somebody and then him  not understanding and worrying cause nobody ever told him what was going on.|`|sj6wRf2aaa	I wouldn't tell him his father's in jail.  Six-year-olds repeat everything.  He'll tell his friends, his friends will make fun of him.  He'll get a complex.
fbguVOiQaa	Has the spark gone or are you just too tired? Im tired with just 2 at 24.<br>  Maybe when the baby is abit older, arrange a nice night out for you and your partner, A romantic meal? drinks? The house without the kids would be a perfect opportunity to bring back the passion!<br>  Other than that, im suck:o$ my spark is gone too!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	To be completely honest, for me at least, the passion went away after the baby and has never come back.  I also an 21 years old but just have one child.  He's 21 months old, and my husband and I have probably had sex 15 times since he was born.  For us sex usually happens about once a month now, but until my son was a year old, it happened maybe once every 3 or 4 months.  Pretty bad, I know.|`|vjsT8DMIaa	good to know Im not the only one. My spark has been out the window for a looong time now! Im 24 and have 3 children...my oldest will be 6, I have a 2 year old, and a 3 month old. Lets put it this way...the last time my husband and I had sex, it was when I was trying to induce labor. at 37 weeks....LOL poor man. Im just not interested. I work full time, have the kids...and Im just TIRED!! Im stressed because my 2 year old is hell on feet, and I feel like my husband doesn't help me discipline them...so that puts alot of stress on our relationship. I wish I could bring our passion back.....but then again....I have alot of other things I could be doing!! LOL <br>  After we had our first child together (the 2 year old), our sex life went down the drain...maybe having sex once every couple of months or so.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Why do you think you're pregnant if you're not even late?|`|YlLmAADraa	just wait and take a test, there is no sense in telling you symptoms so that you can look for them, cause when you think you might be pregnant you look further into things and make up symptoms you don't even have. true story.|`|ce8COixxaa	You'll be waiting for a long time if you are waiting until Feb 30th... ;)<br>  <br>  You'll know you might be preg if you miss your period and have other signs like very tender breasts and nausea. Mainly the period missing is the main thing that will let you know.|`|2n93DU71aa	I think that you are a little to quick to be worried. But some natural signs of pregnancy would be a late monthly cycle, breast tenderness, headaches, and feeling sick and tired. If you think at all that you are pregnant I would test.|`|r7qm08fkaa	you should take a pregnancy test . sometimes there are no signs at all that u are pregnant. but if u are looking for signs, some might be tender breasts, headaches, nausea, and or more than your normal tiredness and hunger.
BySCt7qzaa	I wouldn't worry too much considering you are losing weight due to natural nausea, you aren't purposefully restricting your eating. Make sure to take your prenatals daily, and if you're pre-pregnancy BMI has you overweight or obese, losing weight can actually be a healthy result of eating better during your first trimester. Good luck and don't skip meals!!
Bcm5Ov54aa	Tell him just like kids , Mommy and Daddy like to play games too, but this game has an agae limit and you can't play it untill your __|`|p3d3E75oaa	lol I went through the same thing and he doesn't know what he saw and he is too young for the birds and the bees talk just tell him you were wrestling that's what I told my daughter|`|AA11530601	tell him your having a special cuddle that only mummies and daddies do|`|2N6KEoVqaa	This is my opinion, but I would jsut tell him. At six he is old enough to understand. You don't have to explain sexual gratification, just that when a mommy and daddy really love each other there is an extra special way that they can show their love....and sometimes that love can even give them a baby. You can be as technical as you want as far as EXACTLY what is happening, depending on your son's personal ability to understand. If he is curious, he is ready to know. The last thing you want is to make sex seem dirty or wrong to him. He knows something is going on there, he just doesn't know what it is. I would give him a good start now by making sure he understands that sex is natural, and add your values into the explanation. (Such as it being for those who are married, or those who love each other, etc) Good luck! I am not looking forward to this one!|`|idTdPSvCaa	you should not be having sex in the afternoon when your son is around in the first place,my daughter is three and i wouldnt dream of this whilst she was around,hes far too young to be told the truth but you have to tell him something,and i suggest you save the sex until when he is in bed at night and make sure you lock the door.pay more attention to your son during the day|`|tBx1M0g9aa	okay for little ones you say<br>  Well there are the birds and the bees and they do do somethining special and poof a baby pops in or there is like um well mommy and daddy....................(say something and then go like)and a stork comes and drops off a baby at the dorrstep|`|jlsd1kxtaa	Tell him it's completely inappropriate and he should not concern himself with it.|`|ub7h6u7Qaa	you could either tell him the truth or tell him the story about the snake and the bush :P|`|SVPFyBNaaa	he's still too young for you to explain that too him. i would just be careful about where and when i have sex.|`|nYioXmnGaa	What six year old takes a nap ???|`|AA11612508	my six year old has no idea what we do. atleast what i think... i would never ever have sex in middle of day while my child is home. what are you thinking?? really isnt that a turn off and a lesson to you both.

Still very young but almost old enough to have a conversation with. lol<br>  <br>  It's not fair to not give him an explaination although he is only six, can't tell him too much. <br>  <br>  Maybe give it a few days. Don't have sex while your child is awake. If he continues to spy and wonder then you will have to tell him.<br>  <br>  If you feel it is appropriate you can just explain, in a simple manner, what is really happening. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|joiacDUdaa	He's really too young you just don't.. Just explain that mommy and daddy need "alone" time and leave it at that.  Put a towel under the door and close the blinds.. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Just say its a special kind of wrestling that only married people can do.
SBeDh1f0aa	There is something called a Luteal Phase. It begins just after ovulation, and ends when you start your period. A luteal phase defect is when a woman ovulates around 10 days or less before her period. You cannot concieve, because everything is already to set in place for your period, and before the zygote gets a chance to implant, it's bled out. This is why it's a swell idea to track your periods, because you can usually tell when you ovulate if you count back 14 days BEFORE your next expected period. If you have a perfect 28-day-cycle, then its on cycle day 14. I, for instance, have a 30-day-cycle and i usually ovulate on day 15-17. Still trying to pinpoint it, though. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit:  I just read the rest of your question. My fiance and I have used withdrawal for 1 1/2 and we were fine. Ever heard of plan B?|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Well it is possible, but I say your chances are slim.  If you used a condom, then you should be protected.  Although...he did have it in you, and there is precum, you can get pregnant from that.  I doubt that you are pregnant, but take a test when your period is due to be sure.  For now try to relax, the chances are really slim.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|gUhcMAutaa	that is not true about not being able to get pregnant right before your period. but you should be fine unless his sperm went inside of you. but there is always the possibility. if it is to days later you are too late for plan b that needs to be taken the morning after you have intercourse. i would recommend waiting it out because chances are you are just nervous.
AA11327039	I put the pillow over my head and cried with my child.  (I did my best to keep it as a silent cry because I didn't want my daughter to know I was crying too)<br>  <br>  The first night it was around 4 hours, the second night it was around 2 hours and the third night it was around 45 minutes and the last night it was around 15 minutes.  <br>  <br>  It'll get better. ((Hugs))<br>  <br>  If it really bothers you, then bring her into bed with you or lay in a chair or the couch with her.  <br>  <br>  You have to do what you have to do. If crying it out works for you then do it...if not, become a bed sharing advocate and talk about how it works for you~<br>  <br>  For me, since I only sleep snuggled with my pillow in my own bed, I had to have her sleeping in her own bed too.  Which meant she had to cry it out.  <br>  <br>  She's now almost 4 and does such a WONDERFUL job of sleeping in her own bed for about a 2 hour nap daily and overnight without any interruptions.|`|AA11210211	I don't know it just happens?? I can't explain it....|`|SkOALXv9aa	If you are going to bed at the same time you may want to try putting the little in her crib earlier so she can cry it out before you retire.<br>  <br>  The crying time will get shorter and eventually she will go to sleep shortly after you put her to bed.  If you keep giving in to her crying she will end up sleeping with you until she is in her teens.<br>  <br>  Just do your best to put up with the crying it will soon get better.<br>  <br>  We know what you are going through.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Pick your times to try.  Keep her really, really busy so she is really tired and ready to go to sleep, give her a nice warm tub, cuddle awhile and then try the crib.  Try playing music that is soothing.<br>  <br>  She's old enough to pretty much understand what you want her to do.  Why not take a little shopping trip and let her pick out her new "crib" buddy that she is going to sleep with in her crib.  The buddy stays in the crib, no where else.  Make that very, very clear and stick to it!<br>  <br>  I never could tune out the crying either; you're far from being alone but I found picking the right time helped a whole lot.|`|oojO4WAraa	You either go through with it, or you will be dealing with this problem for years.  Deal with it now and get it over with.  It won't be any easier in 2 years.<br>  <br>  Recognize that the child is crying because that has always gotten her what she wanted in the past.  Develop a spine today, or you will have a world of problems in the future.  The crying is a manipulation technique kids know works.  Recognize that she is not in pain, is not hurt, is not scared, but is manipulating you to get her way.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	after a while you get used to it. but you need to stick at it for it to work. its hard but it works and she wont hate you.|`|mAsQbiIgaa	Yes. I couldn't do that.  My little one was resistant to sleeping in her cot and I was determined not to use the cry it out method.  Despite what people have written it does do harm-it breaks trust that you have built up.  You have spent all this time showing your baby that you will tend to their needs and then when you leave them to cry you are confusing them.  There is plenty of research on this.  <br>  <br>  Instead I created a sleep time routine-wind down-books/rock for two minutes beside crib/into crib.  I then just kept saying 'its ok, you're tired, go to sleep'  I patted her tummy and rubbed her head and she cried sore for about 40 minutes but at least I was right there with her reassuring her.  After 40 minutes she finally fell asleep.  I could hardly stand that crying when I was beside her reassuring her let alone had I just left the room. <br>  <br>  Next nap time it took 20 minutes and she cried only a little on and off.<br>  <br>  Next time, it was five minutes and I've never had a problem since.<br>  <br>  Given that your child is 16 months, it will probably take a bit longer but it is worth it.|`|PJBjllsVaa	i think so. my husband and i used to argue all the time because he's a fan of the cry it out method and i am not. what i tend to do is for example at bed time my daughter (18months) will go to bed in her crib. at first she will talk to herself and make banging noises on the crib but if we don't go up to check on her she gets mad and starts crying. i can't stand too much crying so i give it 15-20 minutes if she doesn't chill out i will go up check on her, lay her back down, let her know mommy and daddy are here and that everything is ok. the next time she does it i will wait longer maybe 30-45 minutes. after this amount of time she is usually so exhausted from crying and trying to get attention that she ends up falling asleep on her own.|`|n1vKoto7aa	It's very very very hard, and the worst thing is, if you give in, you're actually making it worse for your baby. But, if you CAN make it just a few days, it works, and works WELL. The best thing you can do is not give yourself the chance to give in. Find any distraction, even going out and leaving your husband home with the baby. With my first, I played cards on the porch with my brother until 2am, haha. He's now a champion sleeper. With my daughter, it was much harder. We had many setbacks and it took many tries, but at 8 months was finally sleeping through the night in her own room. As tortuous as it was at the time, it was sooooo worth it. Good luck!!!|`|lr9E8IC5aa	It's really hard, I know. It hurts your heart knowing that you little one isn't happy. But it's so worth it. <br>  <br>  With our oldest, we let him cry it out. It lasted about 1 week or so then all was good.<br>  <br>  My youngest, we didn't let him cry it out and OMG are we regretting it. He is not a self soother and is not as independent as our oldest was at that age.<br>  <br>  We used to just sit on the porch and talk with him screaming in the monitor. Usually in about 10-15 minutes later, he was out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Well, you need to get her to sleep inher own crib, that is whats best for her. If you can, get a video baby monitor, set the volume on low, so you can see her but not hear her and sit in another room with the door closed. Then check on her every so often.|`|77hZZZXvaa	Its the worst isn't it!!!!! Take a shower, go outside, listen to your ipod. If you really stick to it it will work, athough you waited a little long so her will power is a little stronger now than say a 7 month old. Good luck, you'll get through it!|`|AA11065140	You don't tune it out...you cringe with every sob.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this is just one of the difficult things you'll have to do as a parent.  You need to be tough and stick it out (otherwise, it's just pain for both of you, with no result!).|`|mRevWUxlaa	It didnt work on my 4. It isnt always the best method. different babies, different parents, different methods... do what you feel is best for you and your baby girl.... Good Luck!!!!|`|5baec14131fd7b822f3da2903a188129aa	Ear plugs or Ipod.  Trust me, the crying will end after a few nights.  I did the sleeping through the night routine with both my kids when they were around 3~4 months old and after a few nights.... perfect bliss.  <br>  Warning!  The screaming the first couple of nights can go on for hours and could result in vomiting... but it's only nerves and will end.  Do not give in.  Tough it out and you'll be so happy.  Good luck!|`|tle3AGJraa	I know it's hard but sometimes crying it out is beneficial to both the baby and the mother.  Give it a few days and see what happens.  I bet both mom and baby will be sleeping like cats....because we all know babies don't sleep...cats do!~|`|bvgZ04zsaa	You don't have to be superhuman but you do need a lot of patience.  Its hard for everyone.  Just keep in mind that soon the crying will end and you'll have her sleeping in her crib every night without incident.
kuHE3z2Maa	Try giving her a relaxing, warm bubble bath before bed. They make a baby bath that has ingredients that help babies to sleep. From my experience, it seems to work. Also, is her room warm enough with enough blankets? Too warm maybe?<br>  <br>  I would definitely bring this issue up at your next scheduled trip to the pediatrician.|`|3NQizLOKaa	Maybe its the dark try getting a night light. Also get a machine that make ocean noises to sooth her. Try rapping her up in blankets. This way  the baby is secure and comfortable<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|UX0Ys5bKaa	just sit by her side at night sing a song, but dont shake her or u <br>   could hurt her bad like hold her at ur face and and really shake her-<br>   dont do that
5axGfFofaa	Sounds like you may have a good shot.  I have tested early in the past and they were negative unless I used first morning urine so wait until you wake up and test again.|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	sounds promising! Wait til Wednesday and test again. If it's still negative but you still don't get your period after a few days, I would go to the doctor for a blood test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|X7G6vhGzaa	Wait until the day your AF is due and do a test first thing in the morning.<br>  <br>  If this is playing on your mind, your body can mislead you. I had a 'phantom' pregnancy a few years back. Didnt have a period for 2 months!!|`|jPnXGIZNaa	Sounds promising!!<br>  The first thing I can always notice is my boobs feel heavy!<br>  Test again Wed. with first morning urine and let us know what happens!<br>  <br>  Loads of baby dust and good luck!
AA11210211	Ultrasound was invented by the English physician Ian Donald in 1957 first tested & one year later was used on a pregnant woman.|`|p3d3E75oaa	I don't know all the tech info but you can tell usually after 20 weeks
YP3rEESUaa	I had that shot with 2 out of 3 of my pregnancy's, due to early labor and both of those pregnancy's I had to be induced or helped along, but I was also given turbutlin to stop the contractions, so I'm not sure if it was the shot or the pills that "stopped" my labor.
uFrqC4Y2aa	I would think so. Do it a lot during the time that you are ovulating.|`|9osFXKPyaa	I SAY IT DO IT THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT EVERYTIME YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND ENJOY IT.....LOL|`|klrQ9yFlaa	You should get a oulvation calendar to chart your fertile days for a better chance to be pregnant. They have a lot of websites that can map it out for you based on the information that you give them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|332e5dccf33179b09bb6186658268a49aa	If your husband has a good sperm count it will be good to try twice on the day of ovulation. Good luck!
yPNvecc7aa	I told everyone (except work) the same day I took the test!<br>  If something bad were to happen, I would have wanted the support. <br>  <br>  I need to talk about things and I'm a very open person. I wouldn't have been able to go through such an exciting or traumatizing time without being able to talk about it with anyone.<br>  <br>  But I only told my work at 10 weeks.|`|KozoNqpsaa	It's usually a good idea to wait until the end of the first trimester (12 weeks) although it can be so tough to wait! We told our parents when my hubby and I first got pregnant that same week that we found out. I would advise telling family and maybe close friends whenever you're comfortable telling them, but wait to tell co-workers or your boss until you're further along. (Also, if you have other children it would be good to wait to tell them as well.)<br>  Congrats and best wishes!!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	A lot of people decide to wait until they are out of the first trimester, when the rate of miscarriage drops significantly. I told my family pretty quickly though, soon after I found out, because I knew no matter what happened I would need their support. I waited until 12 weeks to tell other people like coworkers and friends. It's really up to you!|`|W1p6LetFaa	Totally up to you.  I told my office at 6 weeks because I was falling asleep at my desk. But a part of me wishes I had waited just a little longer, because by the end everyone was asking me "Haven't you been pregnant FOREVER?"  But it really is up to you!  There is no reason why you shouldn't tell!  A lot of people like to wait until the risk of miscarriage goes down, but I personally think people are a lot more supportive if they know you are pregnant BEFORE they know about the miscarriage (heaven forbid).  So tell everyone you want whenever you are ready!  Why should news THIS good be kept a secret for long?!?!<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your little one!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Its WHENEVER you want.  I told my parents at 3 weeks...soon as I got a positive on an HPT.  People tell you to wait until you get out the first trimester (higher chance of miscarriage) but I didn't care...I didn't hold off on my blessed news because of a negative possibility.  Truth is you can have a miscarriage at any time in a pregnancy...you can have a still-born...sad but true.  I wasn't going to hold my joy because of that "1st trimester" rule.  I told all kind've people...LOL.  If you're happy...tell away!!!|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's ok when you're ok with it. Some people choose to wait until the end of the first trimester when the risk of miscarriage drops, but that's a personal choice. <br>  <br>  I honestly waited as long as possible because once you tell people, you'll endure some variation of "How are you feeling?" about 50 times a day. It will get old after awhile, especially when the answer is "I feel like crap but this kid apparently has no desire to leave!"|`|YlLmAADraa	well i was 6 weeks when i found out i was pregnant and i couldn't wait to share with everyone... but was also affraid seeing as i was only 18. i just told some people and let them tell the rest of the family. everyone knew by the time i was almost 3 months.|`|vcfFQSvTaa	its really up to you. but when i started telling people the first 2 times i was pregnant i was 6 weeks and both babys were lost. Now i am 40 weeks pregnant and when i found out i was pregnant this time i didnt even tell my fiance till i was 14 weeks. i didnt want to get anyone exited. Congrats on the news!!! and good luck!!!|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	It is fine to tell people whenever you feel comfortable telling them.  Some people will wait until after the first trimester (13 weeks) because the risk of miscarriage decreases then, but you don't have to wait.  We told our families as soon as we found out with both our kids and that was at 5 weeks and 8 weeks.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well it is really a judgment call.  Most women don't until 12 weeks because then they are out of the danger zone of miscarriage but I could never hold it in that long. I told my close friends and family usually within a week of finding out.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	14 weeks is best, you don't want to have to tell them you lost the baby, its uncomfortable and really upsetting to have that conversation.|`|YLXpwqceaa	Anytime is fine, it's when you are ready.<br>  <br>  Most people want to wait until miscarriage odds are much lower (around 12 weeks).<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congratulations!!!|`|r6NJrasBaa	i was 5 weeks when i told my man but i told everyone else after my first doc appointment, to be sure everything was okay|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I started telling people right away. its up to you sweetie.|`|2z3lTB2Raa	Usually they say and wait until the first 8-12 weeks but i know how hard it is to contain it. If you want to tell the people that are the very closest to you then go ahead.|`|ibR8TkDiaa	when the rate of miscarriage drops which is around 12 weeks
v6DRUwH7aa	Things in life happen for a reason.  Do not be ashamed or let any one put you down.  It's not healthy for you or your unborn children.  I do appreciate the way you are thinking.  So, you are on the right path.  Do not ever be embarrassed to ask for help from those you know and love.  Also, asking for assistance from the council/government is a wonderful idea until you can make it on your own.  As for the the father - it is his obligation to help support the babies financially (amongst other numerous ways that he should already know & be responsible enough to do so on his own).  Call your county child services department & they will help you.  Best of luck to you!|`|AA12074512	after you have the babies go out and find another looser and have some more kids that you cant afford to take care of..dumb a**|`|P9HuD4Qgaa	No, and take his *** to court!|`|wrdPBLq0aa	So! My cousin was 13 and pregnant with twins!|`|5QtseYWuaa	Wow U have a long road ahead of you hun. Stay strong for one if not for you for your kids. I know a lot of people actually with a story very close to yours. My friends step sister Sam is pregnant with twins. I'm not sure wat she is doing about it. She just finished school early at 17. I don't have advice but i really hope that you stay strong through this experience.|`|Ne58NIDGaa	First of all, dont be sad at all! Mistakes happen, and once you give birth to the two children you will not regret a single second. Anybody calling you names or judging  you has no right to because they do not know how you feel or the situation that you are going through. Anyways, I think that you should definitely claim child support from the father, he is entitled to raising that child the same as you are. If he is not willing to be faithful to you and create a family then he will have to help you financially. The government helps with single moms alot too, you can most likely look online for assistance. If school is too much right now you could always get your GED later in life. I'm not sure if you have a job or not, however, maybe a job in childcare would be a good choice. If you start to work at a daycare center you can get paid and eventually when your children need to go you will be able to spend the day with them and still get paid. Also, the daycare center might give you a discount since you already work there! As for your living situations I would just make your future children's room in your room now. Work as much as you can now so that you will have money for diapers, formula, blankets, food, clothes, wipes, powder, and everything else. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|amNXtDvraa	Hello,I think its such a great thing your doing.I would advise to get a council flat they are there for people who need them.You could think about getting a job eventually and maybe go into a rented place in the future.You should contact the child support agency and they will get the right money he should be paying you.You will probably need cribs,bottles,changing equipment,pram.Good luck =)|`|o6M7Hh4naa	You are definately right i bet you have had alot of smack talk to you but dont worry wat is done is done <br>  <br>  The first and most important things you will need for the baby are <br>  Clothing<br>  blankets <br>  bottles <br>  diapers <br>  thermometer ( u need to be checking babies temp becuase they are more vulnerable to infections)<br>  car seats ( they will not let you have the baby unless you have a car seat to take baby home)<br>  formula ( if your not planning to breastfeed but even then you should have a bottle just in case you have to take some medications) <br>  wash cloths and honey since you are a teen mother you qualify for lots of government help i know most will say that is not the way to go but in this case its 2 babies n you need as much help as you can get u can get the pregnancy medicaid and that will automatically qualify you for housing... But dont think that its good to live off of that for ever you have to set a goal upon yourself to give those kids a better life than that and teach them better finish school go to a technical college and soon enough you will be on your own feet without the help of that bastaard who left two babies to their luck <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and to your babies <br>  and leran from everything that comes with life but DO NOT REPEAT IT!!!<br>  <br>  Congrats on the twins
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Well, I qualify as a "clean freak" to most people...but it is because of my OCD.  And I spent a lot of time in behavior therapy for this.<br>  <br>  The motive is I have obsessive thoughts about disorder and germs.  I can literally "see" germs crawling on surfaces (yes, I know it sounds weird...that is the best way I can describe it to someone that does not experience it though.)  I have trouble moving on to other tasks before I have set everything in perfect order.  I also rarely invite people into my home, and when I do...I go around and sanitize everything they might have touched after they have left.  As a child/teen...I washed my hands to the point that they would bleed.<br>  <br>  Why do I do this?  Because this is the make up of my brain.  It would be nice to not be anxiety ridden over what people have told me is an abnormal thought process...but I'm working on it.  And I've made it all these years, so I suppose it isn't the worst thing.  (But it is hard to deal with some times, many people don't understand it and can make you feel pretty bad about it.)|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Well I am obsessive about it--being clean.<br>  Its just the way I like it: counter tops and tables wiped, dished done, floors swept, things put away, picked up, sprayed (with lysol). I have a thing with germs and there are 6 people in this house so, I am constantly tiding something and then spraying it down just in case there is some germ unforseen there. Ya, so like I said I am little obsessive but... there is nothing wrong with staying clean. Being clean shows responsibilty and respect for belongings or possesions as well as respect for oneslelf and others....<br>  <br>  Of course I will spend the rest of my life doing it...I like things clean. Just as I shower everyday and will do so for the rest of my life...or paying bills, getting gas, washing laundry, brushing teeth, cooking dinner; these are things that I have to do for the rest of my life whether I like it or not (thank god I enjoy cleaning)and chores such as cleaning are included in that list.|`|EzcQOTPtaa	I think they are annoying and usually very rigid , unforgiving people. A lot of time their motive is to make others feel bad, and they make a big show about complaining about how much they "had to do" when it was their decision. They also might like taking their frustrations out on the dirt.|`|vhMe2oCGaa	Completely nuts !!!!<br>  My children need to feel comfortable, happy, and safe in their home .<br>  I don't care if my couch has a half broken blanket cave on it or if my clean sheets off the washing line are draped over the trampoline or something they need to be able too enjoy the house as much as any one else if not more. being a clean freak would Just be a waste of my time with a newborn and five and six year old .<br>  My house is clean and tidy but it is ant immaculate (unless grandmas coming).|`|nfzQkvqraa	I guess it depends on what you're definition of "clean freaks" is.  I like my house clean.  I feel like when the clutter is kept to a minimum I can enjoy what I'm doing much more.  For some people, it might be OCD related.

I could be that way since I had lived alone and was thrilled to have a clean house with EVERYTHING in order and with its place.  Ahhh... those were the days.  Then someone else enters your life - husband lst and then baby #1, 2, 3 & 4 and clean freak goes out the window and is replaced with REALITY.  Not everyone can let GO of those neurotic tendencies - thankfully I could and did.  I still WISH i had a perfect house and I certainly am more at peace, more calm, happier even when everything is "IN ORDER" - but life doesn't always allow for that so I have had to learn to LET IT GO.  <br>  <br>  Maybe one day when I don't have 6 people in my household anymore who I can't EXPECT TO be perfectly in order all the time - I can have my perfect house again - but until then ya just gotta let it go or be very unhappy OR spend your days 24/7 doing nothing but cleaning up after everyone else and getting very frustrated and wasting ALL YOUR TIME doing nothing else because you are SOOOO freakin worried about something being out of order....  TYPE A personality that would be....<br>  some people can't help it - but to live & be happy and worry about the things that MATTER MOST you do have to learn how to let some things go.... in moderation at least.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Because they like to walk into and relax in a clean house?<br>  <br>  <br>  Mozz.....

PLEASE!!|`|lkhCeAdJaa	By my children's assessment, I am a clean freak.<br>  the reason I do it is simple....I want things to be clean.  If you were looking for a more sinister motive, sorry I couldn't help you.<br>  <br>  With five children, one husband, and  a home day care, I hardly spend my life cleaning, although it does feel that way sometimes!  I have way more things to do than clean, but I enjoy it and t makes me feel good to see the results of my efforts.<br>  <br>  Okay by your standards I am not a clean freak.  I have never met anyone who cleans for that long!!  But I must say that I do  have limitations on what my children do and don't do because of my need for cleanliness.  They can' t wear cleats in the house.   They can't sit on the furniture when they are sweaty and smelly.   I don't allow them to leave their toys all over  the house at anytime.  If they are not using it, they have to put it away.  They think I am a clean freak because I am constantly reminding them to put things away.  By your definition, I am not a clean freak.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I’m not a clean freak, but I like to be clean. I prefer things to be clean. Why? Because I feel less stressed when everything is in its place.

But I sure as heck try!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My ex used to clean and clean and clean.  It was really annoying when it would take him 45 minutes to vacuum a room, but it was refreshing, too, because I didn't have to do it!  LOL!<br>  <br>  I think his motive was to annoy me and be quirky.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I'm a bit of a clean freak.  Everything has a place and it must be there at the end of the day!  Lysol is my friend.  GermX is awesome.  I actually love to clean and organize! :)<br>  <br>  But I'm not so crazy as to where I won't let people come to my house or my kids have toys.  I think I spend on average about 2 hours a day cleaning unless I have to do a deep cleaning.  Deep cleaning is not done anymore than once or twice a month though.  The house I grew up in was always dirty and it drove me NUTS.  I mean serious dirty.  As in pet waste on the floor and mold in the kitchen.  I have vowed to not let my house be a pigsty.<br>  <br>  People who are obsessive may have come from an exceptionally overbearing home where perfection is expected or a really dirty home and they don't want to have a dirty home.  It could be a number of reasons.  Unless it inteferes with their ability to function and be a good parent, then I say clean away!<br>  <br>  Did you know that people who live in clean, organized homes actually have lower stress levels because there isn't any clutter around them?|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I love to clean but my husband takes cleaning to a whole new level. I think he's slightly OCD, I can clean something and he will go right behind me and wipe it down again. He does that everyday. I'll be home spending a day cleaning and then he comes and wants something a "certain" way and he'll start cleaning. His reasoning behind is how he was brought up, but sometimes it gets to be annoying.|`|um29wkUPaa	I don't have a motive, I just can't live in philth.  It's not personal or to show anyone up.  It's just my standards.  I'm not only displeased when the house is trashed, I freak out.  I get in a frenzy only I understand.  <br>  <br>  What's a clean freak?  I dont scrub under microwaves if I don't have to, or dust the tops of picture frames.  Well, once a year I do (I spring clean too).<br>  <br>  I clean constantly.  I actually like cleaning. <br>  <br>  *** Ooh yes Nina, can I decorate it too?|`|sxecXFgraa	My kids call me a clean freak.  My house is cleaned and organized.  I don't spend hours a day cleaning, but I do make everyone in the house clean up after themselves.  My kids do have toys but they know the toys are to be back in their bedroom when they're done playing with them.  If there not, I take them and they have to pay me to get them back.  I can't stand dirty dishes in the sink, (if you're done with a dish, put it in the dishwasher).  I think my biggest pet peeve is toothpaste in the sink.  I overheard my daughter tell my son one night to make sure he cleaned it out so "Moma doesn't freak out."  I do let people come over, I'm not that anal.  <br>  <br>  I do this because I hate coming home to a dirty house, whether it's from a day at work or vacation.  My home is where I relax.  I can't relax when the place is dirty.  I go to a friend house a lot and every time I walk in her living room, it's like walking through a mine field of toys.  I refuse to walk around in my own home being scared of tripping over a toy.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Its learned behaviour, if you parents are clean, tidy, fastidious people you sort of inherit it. Luckily I didn't.  <br>  <br>  My neighbour spends an hour cleaning her windows every day - every single day. I'm in my 40s and I clean mine when my mother visits, once a year, life is too short to worry about how sparkly your windows are.<br>  <br>  My kids are never sick, I reckon by coming into contact with a certain amount of germs it strengthens their immune system.  Furniture polish and air freshener can't be good for your lungs.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well I'm a clean freak... I do it because I don't want my son to live in a filthy house... I like the fact that my son can roll around on the carpet, and I know he's clean. I like that I don't have to move things to sit on my couch, and I like it that everything has a spot so I know where I can find things. My mother in law is the complete opposite, I hate going to her house, when we leave my sons clothes are always dirty, just from running around, you have to move papers and stuff to sit down... and I left my jacket there the other day, I went back to get it, and they can't find it in their clutter... I personally couldn't live like that... I like to come home and relax... not come home and say wow this house is a mess, I really need to clean. Plus if you stay on top of it, you don't have to spend as much time cleaning.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	Because clutter, trash, dishes and clothes everywhere drives me nuts, plus I'm a germaphobe. I can't stand when things are not in their proper place,and seeing dirt anywhere in my house is super annoying. I don't understand people who want to live in filth it is so unhealthy.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Cleaning is my obsession! I hate the thought of germs and anything filthy especially when my daughter's around. I can't help it, I need things to be clean.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	They don't like being dirty freaks, I suppose.
rvoo4rBjaa	It doesn't have to be! just be organized and nap when they nap and spend time with the older one when the baby is sleeping so he doesn't feel left out. have the oldest help bring you a diaper or something when your working with the baby, it will make him/her feel important and that they are helping and have your hubby take turns spending one on one time with each child .But be careful-- a third one that close could spell disaster.LOL.|`|YP3rEESUaa	my middle child and my youngest are 14 months apart, and honestly i never had a problem with them, things ran smooth for me, you just have to make sure to involve the older child when caring for the new baby this will create a bond between them and that should really cut down on fighting when they are older.   my son is very protective of his little sister!!  Also try to stick to a schedual too that will help cut down on chaos!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out :)|`|MmP7Kdg7aa	my daughters are 11 months and 2 weeks apart in age. I go completely insane everyday. They are one and two and get into everything. Today seems to be one of the really bad days. But I'm also a single mother with no help from anyone.
zK1V9Mu7aa	I don't know the answer to your questions Ms P, but I hope you conceive quickly and safely! Good Luck and lots of Baby Dust xxx|`|3fYRi1y4aa	If you are told to wait to try to conceive then I would wait.  Why take the chance that you dont have a good lining built up?
5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	OMG!  My 8 1/2 month old daughter is going thru the same thing!  I had her toy box out this weekend and she has this ball that moves and sings and lights up and she freaked out, she also freaked out when I turned on her little up up elmo, he talks and moves...she does this when she hears the mixer, our paper shredder, packing tape being unrolled...many noises freak her out...that I can understand, but her going bonkers over the little toys, I am not sure about...hopefully she will grow out of it.  I don't think there is any need for concern though.  Good luck!|`|rTACLd3Saa	It seems a bit odd but I'm sure it's just a phase.  My daughter is 10 1/2 months old now and I was just laughing this morning becasue she is afraid of this little toy PDA someone got her for Christmas.  She got so many toys I put a bunch away and just brought out a few the other day and this PDA is one of them.  Anyway, it has a vibrate function when you push the big button and every time she accidentally sits on it it vibrates and she freaks out!  It just cracks me up, LOL!  I know, I'm a mean mommy.  Of course I console her through my chuckles but it's just so funny.  I'm sure your daughter will grow out of this phase.  Have you tried different kinds of toys?  Maybe its the texture or the brightness or the sounds they make.  Hope you figure it out but even if you don't I'm sure it will pass soon.  Cheers!|`|deIzFnV8aa	Just consider how big some of those toys are relative to her! let her get used to them while you are holding her, or have them "talk" to her from afar for starters.|`|L1DUcTtSaa	I think its just a phase, also remember she is still very young so its normal for her to be holding on to you a lot. She will grow out of it no worries.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I'm sure it's just a phase she is going through. Just give her time, before long she will LOVE her toys.
tQPvv0Glaa	Wait a few more days and take a test.  Good luck!|`|YlLmAADraa	well if your period arn't regular then maybe it's still gonna come. I had the same feelings when i was pregnant, i got period cramps and no period then realized i was 11 days late and took a pregnancy test and i was pregnant. take a test and see. if its negative and you still don't get your period in a week take another one.|`|ApyrV5J9aa	You could have done the morning after pill but that would have been needed within 72 hours of intercourse, so it is now too late for that. I'm not sure when your period is supposed to start but I would wait until you think it should before you take a pregnancy test. Depending on when it should start, there is a chance you may be pregnant and then you have some things to think about. Good luck.|`|QAmgy7oXaa	Id take a test every 3 days, Thats what iv been doing. Because im not 100% sure when my period is. So iv been taking test every 3 days.<br>  <br>  And you can get $1 ones from the dollar general. They work just as good.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	It would depend on when you had your last period to find out if you were fertile then. Then again sometimes that doesn't matter. You may be pregnant, but I am not sure. I know that there is a pill you can take call the day after pill that you can get at any pharmacy, but you have to be 18 to get it without a prescription. Also you would have had to use that pill within 3 days of having sex and you are way past that point. I don't suggest abortion, but you have to do what is right for you if you are pregnant. Most pregnancy tests out there you can do 5 days before a missed period, but since you are past that point you should be able to take one now and find out if you are. Hope this helped.
nwivNuYlaa	Hi ,<br>  I had same problem with mine..<br>  Make a routine in the evening,Always tell her what comes next ,( after u finish dinner we will have bath ),<br>  Put her in the bed ,live a small light ,give her the favorite toy and go...<br>  let her cry for 3-4 min...go to her very calm,tell her time to sleep and tuck her again in the bed...<br>  do the same ,but Always Attend to her Little more late ( 3min,after make it 5 min ..and  after go to her after 6 min ....)<br>  U will have a hard time in the first nights...but in a few days she will settle.<br>  Say time to sleep ,or good night only few time when u o to her...just put her in the bed and try not to talk or have eye contact <br>  Good Luck|`|Ne58NIDGaa	I just recently watched an episode of Nanny 911 and the family had a problem with one son who refused to sleep alone. The nanny decided to let the young boy decorate his room and put everything in it that he wanted (within moderation of course). But it worked!!! And the boy decided that he loved his room so much he didn't want to sleep anywhere else.|`|nndfTOo9aa	my daughter was the same way....we finally got her to sleep in her own bed when we got her a t.v. for her room. now every night she picks out a movie and lays right down, and is asleep in 10 minutes.
qUr5P7hgaa	I don't believe your pregnant. This same thing has happened to me once or twice in my younger years (i'm 28) and I was worried too(or excited) but my flow either started heavy the next day or my real period came a few days later..If your period came on time and there is blood I am going to say that you are not pregnant. For some reason I am not in beliefe of pregnancy with the pull out method (if your hubby is really good like mine) because I have been having a lot of sex with the pull out method in the last 6-7 years and I have not been blessed with an unplanned pregnancy :)  You have 25% chance getting prego with pull out method if doing it for a whole year and a lot of women say they get prego that way but it hasn't happened for me.<br>  Oh and I was not or never have been on birth control....<br>  <br>  Anyhoo again, It's my opinion that you are not prego :( sorry to disappoint but if you are going to start trying I wish you all the luck!!!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You could be....anything is possible.  It could be some breakthrough bleeding and would take a test just to make sure.|`|sXU3RrfWaa	You definitely could be. I'd say its 50/50 because periods can be so strange sometimes. Wait a couple weeks and take a test.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I spotted for the 1st three months of my 1st pregnancy right around the time my period was due.  <br>  <br>  Men spill a little sperm before they ejaculate.  You don't have to have an "accident" when using the withdrawal method to become pregnant.<br>  <br>  I'd take a home pregnancy test.  If your test is positive start taking prenatal vitamins and call your doctor.  <br>  <br>  I think your chance of being pregnant is very high.
ELSKfMpxaa	I would say it's ok<br>  My dad.. well if I had brought home a B in any subject he'd have beat me half to death. I got an A- once and was grounded for like.. ever.. well it seemed like it at the time. <br>  <br>  different people set different standards for their kids. I say just ignore your mom's attitude. No sense fighting with her over it|`|cYGoTLlyaa	My moms the opposite, and it isn't much better. I strive to get straight A's (which I do) because I know I can do it, and I personally prefer the extra work for an A than a B. Such as hours upon hours of studying. My mom always asks why I try so hard, she would be fine with a bunch of B's. But I just tell myself, I'm not getting these grades for my mom, I'm getting them for me. If you are proud with a B, which is a very good grade, then so be it. Don't stress too much because stress is very bad for the body. Chill. Relax. Smile. :)|`|H0sPCJQPaa	B is pretty good thats like a 70%<br>  A's are better|`|MIgxkmIqaa	Getting a B in math is excellent! Keep up the good work! I HATED MATH! I got C's and thought that I was doing great! Ask your teacher to write home a note to your mom saying that you are trying hard and that math is tough for you. Stay after school and get extra help if you feel like you need it. Your teacher will be happy to help you, but it sounds like your doing just fine! Parents can be tough sometimes when they set high goals for their children. I wouldnt keep bringing it up in conversation with your mom. She sounds kinda irrational. Good job on your B!|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	A "B" is above average.  Congratulations!  Your mother may be trying to live vicariously through you.  It is good that you want to push yourself though.  Ask your teacher for more pointers, review any missed problems on homework or quizzes and tests.  Practice an additional 15 minutes each night.  You should be able to reach your goal.  <br>  In the meantime, know that you are doing quite well and should be proud of yourself.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Your mom is crazy. A B is above average! Your doing great and your mom needs to chill.<br>  <br>  P.S. Don't push yourself past your limits to please your mom. You should be proud!|`|c74PM9tKaa	a 'B' is not a terrible grade, if you tried your best then it's a good grade.|`|16bWGB14aa	You should feel good about bringing it up. That's horrible that your mom is trying to make you feel like you didn't accomplish anything. You can try to make an A if it will make you happy and besides math is hard for a lot of people.|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Definately!|`|8chxrFFQaa	You did well. She should be focusing on the fact that you improved on your grade.<br>  <br>  Keep working hard!|`|sAbah6dTaa	a's and b's are good, when you get c's you're going downn hill!!<br>  <br>  id say you're doing awesome!|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I think its fine. i barely passed 7th grade math. so just keep trying ur best but dont push yourself too hard|`|wWE6u4peaa	psh ur mom is crazy<br>  <br>  no offence<br>  <br>  a B is awesome|`|aVFyG1n7aa	Getting a B is great, especially for a 7th grader. As long as you're trying your hardest, the grade doesn't much matter. If you're working really hard and learning a lot. The letter grade means nothing. Look at me - I failed out of my AP class even though I tried harder than before after I got a C+, but I could turn around and tell my mother all about George Washington's inauguration. It's what you learn and how hard you work that counts, not the grade on paper. Don't overwork yourself like I did, you're obviously a smart kid with a bright future and a lot of potential. Don't let other people take that because THEY expect better from you.|`|XGQpgTU3aa	well a B in math is really good. math is always a hard subject for most people and having such a good grade in there is pretty darn good :)|`|yLyMG8Emaa	I can totally relate to you. I think a B in math is fine. Everyone has their strengths and weak points. I was never great at Math. The fact that you raised you grade is awesome to me. It shows your effort. Some people never get an "A" in certain subjects. I could understand if she said a C was a problem. A "B " is still above the norm. <br>  <br>  These days math is a bit challenging. Way more challenging than it was when many parents were in school. Ask your mom to help you with your homework one night. Maybe she will be able to see for herself that it isn't easy, especially if she has trouble doing it herself.<br>  <br>  Good luck kid. I'm glad that these are the types of issues that you are dealing with. You will do great in school with this type of care for your work. Also, your mom just wants to push you to be the best you can be. Some parents could care less how their kids do in school, be glad that you do not have one of those.
lN0GkKgaaa	Yes. If you were capable of passing and yet you were flaking off and not doing your work or studying for tests and you failed 2 classes I would ground you the same way..<br>  <br>  But, if you were actually trying hard, studying, doing all your work, and I could see you were working hard and you still failed, I would not ground you but I'd talk with the school on getting you lower classes or extra help(tutor).<br>  <br>  EDIT:: I wouldn't confine you in your room. I think you should be free to roam around the house or backyard.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Far too long|`|sxecXFgraa	If he failed a class that he could pass, which is saying he just decided to be lazy, yes I would.<br>  <br>  You need fresh air?  Open a window.|`|m25lpepOaa	I never, ever believed in grounding a child. Come on, if you are that angry at your child that they are getting bad grades, then step up to the plate as a parent and deal with it, don't shove the kid in his room for six months. I hate how many parents believe that locking a kid up in isolation will magically change the way he works in school. If your child is having trouble in school you should take the parental initiative to hire a tutor or maybe even simply talk to the teacher. If the problem with grades is a behavioral problem, then the majority of schools issue weekly progress reports, in which teachers can tell the parent how he is doing on his assignments, conduct, and effort, in short periods of time. <br>  <br>  I think a lot of the problems with "kids these days" is that their parents don't know how to deal with them. Shoving a kid in a room for six months is not parenting, and it isn't discipline. You might as well ignore the problem until it happens again, next grading term because your child is rebelling after being locked up in solidarity.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	6 months is a little too much. It depends on the situation. If he actually tried to do his best on both subjects, then he shouldn't have been grounded because atleast he tried. If he spent his school year fooling around, not doing homework, not studying for tests etc.. he deserves to be disciplined. But I think that 6 months is pushing it too far!|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Sure would.  And if he needed fresh air, unless he lives in a dungeon or basement with no windows, you could always open one.  You should really study and do better in school.  You could do it if you really wanted to.  You just have to try.|`|KA4jmUoMaa	That is abuse pure and simple.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	It doesn't matter how many times you ask most people will not agree with you. I personally would not have grounded you for so long. Probably until you get your grades up in which case you determine how long that is. But the computer, xbox, and tv would be out of your room. You could have friends over during the week but no going out. Good luck, hope you get your answer.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	Grounding for six months is NOT a good idea.<br>  <br>  Maybe grounding him until he got the grade up to something you find acceptable.  This would give him encouragement to do better in his classes to do better.  He would also react better to a time line he could control.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|J38v75bvaa	you ask how can a parent do this to a child...because they are the parent. my 15 year old nephew got 3 ds on his progress report and my brother grounded him for 3months. and thats just a progress report. by the time the actually report card came he had nothing but as and bs|`|4d38b5e779d34e18d56ef4285647b2efaa	Maybe if you got off the computer and actually spent time studying you wouldn't be failing.|`|AA12145826	OPEN A WINDOW!!!|`|AA11540024	they are the parents so they simply can.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	how can a kid who's grounded be on the computer???|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Yes, it is perfectly acceptable, because you didn't fail because you don't know it, you failed because you are lazy.<br>  <br>  If you were trying your best and failed, it would be too severe.<br>  <br>  You are just sitting on your *** and letting yourself fail, I say it is not severe enough!<br>  <br>  Also, read. It's good for you. If you want to get out, go to the library for books.|`|gi7JwPGJaa	i am the mother of a 14 yr old...she knows that c's and above are acceptable...but if she were to bring home a F i would make sure she was grounded until she showed her grade was coming back up...6 months is too llong unless you show no improvement or lack of enthusiasm for getting your grades up...what else do parents make you do except go to school and get good grades..|`|vhMe2oCGaa	Not if you don't want him to continuously to break his grounding.<br>  Personally i don't think groundings ever really work. i know the didn't for me.|`|3cB1fFtsaa	That is waaaaaaaaaay toooooooooooooo long.

r8ThtdMGaa	well any time that you have had sex there is a chance that you will get pregnant your best bet to be on the safe side is to get on the pill and all ways use a condom like even on your period there is still a chance but i cant remember but i think when you ovulate is like the 15-18 day and that's when the egg is most like the most susceptible  to get knocked up. but don't for get that sperm can live out side of the body for up to 3days so it has 3 days to get in the egg. and i all ready know your next ? per *** there has not been enough Research on it to tell if it fertile or not some experts say that it is and some say that it is not they say that it is only fertile when a guy gets off and does not pee in between the next ejaculation then the pre *** will have sperm in it but once a gen that is not for sure so just all ways use a condom even then they only work 87% of the time so get the pill and use both. and if your underage then tell your mom you want to regulate your period and the pulling out method is only ike 27% effective and the pill is 99% so i don't wanna sound like your dad or mom but use safe sex|`|1thzSbS8aa	A few days after your period is usually the best time to get pregnant, and the so-called "pull out" method isn't a method at all.

Babies all go at their own pace. When your daughter is ready she will do it. If you are still worried you can talk to her doc about it, but I will tell you that I am sure she is fine.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	I think my son was about 13 months when he walked.  From what you've said she can do it so there's nothing wrong physically, she might just be a little bit lazy at the moment!  I wouldn't worry just yet coz once she really gets going you'll be wishing she couldn't walk any more!|`|7i6qj4OXaa	No, I don't think you should if she is walking around the furniture.  She will do it when she is ready.|`|ps11uX4Naa	hiya, you sound just like i did when my daughter was 14 months old, she wouldnt walk on her own but she had done it afew times before, everyone with babies the same age seemed to be walking really well while my daughter was happier to be carried or pushed in the buggy but by the time she was 14 months and 3 weeks she was away and she hasnt stopped since, she is a fantastic walker now, ive just had another baby 10 weeks ago and was so sure she would still need a buggy that i bought 2 double buggys to make sure she was ok but she can walk for up to an hour which is alot longer than any of her baby friends of the same age, so i wouldnt worry about it, make the most of it while you can still get her in her buggy coz soon enough she will want to walk everywhere and it will take you double the time to get anywhere <br>  xxx|`|jsdDgIuRaa	No I wouldn't worry.  My son started walking around furniture when he was maybe 7.5 months and didn't start walking on his own til recently, just after 13 months.  One day he just stood up and started walking on his own (and falling a lot!).<br>  <br>  So if she started cruising at 10 months I am sure it will happen within the next few months, I wouldn't worry.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	i think the "timeframe" for walking depends on baby's activity level and weight (believe it or not).. so definitely speak up when you go to the pediatrician (i had an "episode" like that and it turned out to be nothing).. at the same time, move on to "mom's little tricks" of putting things of interest (toys) higher than usual, so to provide that motivation that your daughter seems to be lacking :)|`|iMaTMWMxaa	If she is still walking around the furniture ok, then there's no need to worry.<br>  <br>  My eldest didn't walk until 18 months, and didn't walk around the furniture before that either.<br>  <br>  If she was walking, and now she's not, I'd pop her to the doctors for a check over.|`|VeuJB4lEaa	no not at all, my son was 18months before he started walking, hes 2 now and hes running round like mad now :P x it worried me aswell because my sisters two children were walking at 8-9 months, but she will when shes ready :)|`|bd5ca4564ee33749d2a59d4dca6d0270aa	Each child is different. My son walked at 10 months and my daughter didn't walk till 16 months. You can always bring it up to your pediatrician if you are concerned but I'm sure all is ok.|`|AA10662866	squiet normal some dont walk until 2-3 years old|`|2LmfQUbKaa	unless you see some problem i wouldnt worry babies take on things when they are ready! it will come!|`|Ry8PvJoraa	no dont be worried, babys learn on there own time, when she is ready to she will

O3EtP4vOaa	Yes most definately.  You should be getting ready to ovulate around that time if you have a 24 day cycle, and sperm can live 72 hrs plus once inside.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Yes defo go on to www.babycenter.co.uk and go to ovulation calculator, this will tell u when u r likely to ovulate.<br>  Hope u get the answer u want x|`|fG727pkuaa	Yes, 10 days after my period is when i ovulate. i didnt find this out until i used a fertility monitor. If your trying to get pregnant use ovulation tests or a fertility monitor.
tQPvv0Glaa	I would skip the snacks in the beginning.  4 year olds probably won't be hungry enough to have snacks and then eat pizza right away (and then have cake and ice cream), especially since they'll be distracted by all of the activities - they'd probably rather play than eat.  Just have the kids play with toys until all of the guest arrive and then have pizza and juice.  Don't worry too much about sticking to the time table, just let the kids have fun.  And I do think that your daughter should open her gifts when the kids are there - they will all really enjoy this part.  Have fun!|`|VU4DLpnlaa	i'd add something like pass the parcel or duck, duck, goose! but everything sounds wonderful|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Honestly it sounds like an excellent party.  That's such a great idea to have them decorate their own cupcakes and make their own sundays!  The only thing I would suggest is that if you plan to eat pizza at 12:30, snacks before hand are probably not necessary.  The kids will fill up on snacks and not want any lunch.<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  Happy birthday (to your daughter!)|`|Cwqkbp49aa	It sounds nice.  I would make sure none of the kids are allergic to anything.  Other than that, it sounds simple and time will go fast.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Having a time-frame like that is a good idea however keep in mind with toddlers they may not necessarily be ready to move on from one thing to the next.  Also, keep in mind not everyone arrives at the same time. <br>  <br>  I would set up a coloring station in addition to the play area so when the kids arrive, they can go straight into coloring and playing like you have above.  Once all the kids arrive let them play for the time you allowed above (30 minutes) then serve Pizza/lunch...if you give them snacks too early on, they won't be interested in eating lunch and will prefer to continue playing.  I think the decorating cupcake and making your own sundaes is a great idea.  After decorating desserts and eating them, they're going to be all sugared up so maybe see if you can pencil in some more playtime...add another activity or two, maybe a game or two for them to play like a bean bag toss, balloon pop, or something outdoors (weather permitting of course).  After some additional play time round them up for presents and goodie bags.  Since you're only having 5 kids bringing things, I think opening presents there would be okay.  Have your daughter do her thank you's with the goody bags on a one on one basis as each child leaves the party since some may leave before others. <br>  <br>  If you can help it, try not to be too strict with the timing because you don't want to seem like you're rushing things or people out the door.  Hope this helped some.  Good luck and have fun!|`|hVVALFAPaa	Sounds pretty good but you can never tell with 4 year olds. <br>  <br>  I would have a couple of back-up games planned, 'just in case' -- especially something that could get them moving if they are especially wiggly and hyper.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider not opening the gifts in front of the other kids. It is really boring for them to watch someone else open presents. Try a game there instead, and open the presents later that evening.<br>  <br>  Games such as pin the tail on donkey or duck, duck goose.<br>  <br>  Try www.familyfun.com or other preschool game sites.
qGQUZM90aa	Your parents are only out for your good, look we were all kids once even your parents!. They have seen it all, most likely been there, wore the T shirt etc., All they want is for you to educate yourself properly, and in order to do this you have to study. Do not think for one minute that they are against you, to the contrary they want what's best. At the end of the day only you can decide, job prospects or a wasted life. I only wished that I had listened to my parents!!. Take your chances now while you have them, and if you do, you will never stop thanking your parents later on in life, believe me. I hope you listen to me and you will find that your relationship with everyone will be much happier.. I hope everything works out, best of luck..|`|Cbom3Lweaa	tell your parents that if they don't take the pressure off you will leave school and become a binman trust me if they think you feel forced into a corner over this then they should back off. There is enough pressure on you without your parents acting as they are|`|CNB7WITFaa	maybe they had some dreams, or maybe they have been worrying about you going to porno sites, now that your older.|`|aRkYiXtGaa	sounds like they only want the best for you|`|mNzgWFkGaa	Oh yes parents can really suck sometimes!  I remember only too well what it's like to be a teenager with a don't do this don't do that. the thing is see that they are only acting that way because they really do have your best interests at heart  ( i guess deep down you know that) but at the same time they don't realise that you are indeed growing up and actually need to be allowed to have your own bit of  time just to do what you want even if that's only pottering about on the computer or chatting with mates.  Sounds like they need to let go a bit and allow you a bit of breathing space.  In order to get let out to see your friends why don't you try sitting down and asking them to LISTEN  and you explain that you know that they worry about you but that you promise that you will tell them EXACTLY where you are going and who you are with and agree a time for you to be back by and if you need any help at all that you promise to call them straight away , Hopefully if you sit down and talk  like that they'll see that you are indeed taking a responsible attitude and they will let up a little. Or you could call their bluff and ask hows that being unreasonable if they object .And by the way in these recession hit times even having a job as a binman is a source of real pride .|`|2992c9f572b21b27b8cb0f9e0f893ddaaa	Hi :)<br>  Thats really weird cause i have a family like yours too including 3 brothers. I'm 16 now and i used to have the whole computer issue with my parents, i beleive they only tell you to come off because they want to be anoying and to show they are boss but i guess in some way its cause they care (I can't beleive i'm saying this).<br>  The whole they wont let you go into town thing is a load of rubbish!<br>  Your 15 and you can't even go out with your friends? thats redicious.<br>  Talk to them and ask them why they wont let you go. Tell them your 15, not 5 and that you'd be with friends and how they're allowed out and your not. <br>  AND....THEY GOT RID OF YOUR MOBILE?? Ugh why don't parents understand that we want to talk to our friends..so if your not allowed to speak to them on msn and your not allowed to go out with them how are you supposed to have a social life??<br>  Tell themyou need your mobile to contact them or something. Sorry i'm off on a rant lol.<br>  Tell them your not a baby, your area isnt rough and that your 15!!<br>  Hope this helps lol. E-mail me if you want to chat. xx|`|3BfmNEdPaa	Well I wouldn't say you were addicted cause the inventor of the computer knew that people would want to go on it constantly. You could try to tell them to get a computer check or something. (an old friend of mind has one) Her with that her mom can tell who she called and what number it is.(that's your solution to the computer problem) Try to get a parent of your friend's to meet your parent's but make sure that it's a parent YOU ALL CAN AGREE ON, that way you can be like "Hey mom and dad i'm going to the movies with Jon and the gang!" "You will not" "Don't worry we're going with Mike's dad as a supervisor!" "Oh! Well alright. Have a nice time."|`|X7DDlR1caa	They just want you to have potential and ambition, prove to them without being told you can do your work and work hard at it, study say an hour a night and make sure they know, explain to your parents that your capable of getting the grades you need and they should trust you to have some you time with your friends, tell them you need freedom and its getting you down, explain that your reliable and wont get into mischief with your friends. If they don't accept it then, then your going to disobey their rules and tell them that, that will soon get you out and about.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Your parents are looking out for you.. try to take their advice. They obviously care about you very much.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let you go out or play on the computer either if you weren't even doing your school work. <br>  <br>  Your education is SO important. It opens many doors for you and you shouldn't throw it away. You're very lucky to have a family who wants the best for you.
Z1e3Cxjoaa	My doctor told me that it is mainly the pressure the baby's head puts on your cervix with a little help from the contractions.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Contractions cause you to dialate. Nobody is 100% sure what causes labour though.|`|uuHPneEcaa	contractions make u dilate.|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's contractions.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	What causes your cervix to dilate is when baby drops(this is when your tummy drops down lower on you relieves your lungs and stomach and apply more pressure on you bladder). <br>  <br>  When the baby first drops its called lightening; the sensation the mother feels when the baby "drops" down or gradually settles into pelvis as the presenting part becomes engaged. <br>  <br>  Than the baby is engaged; the entrance of the baby's presenting part into the upper oval of the mothers pelvis. In primigravidas, engagement often takes place about two weeks before the baby's birth. in multigravidas, it can occur as late as the onset of labor.<br>  multigravida= a woman having her second child<br>  primigravidas=a woman having her first child<br>  <br>  Shortly after you lose your mucus plug that is in your cervix as the baby starts settling down into your pelvis this is when you start to dilate<br>  <br>  So essentially your baby drops> contractions pushes baby on cervix>lose mucus plug> effacement and Dilation begin<br>  <br>   Contractions; the rhythmic tightening and relaxation of the uterus. They case effacement and dilation of the cervix and they push the baby out of the uterus. True Labor contractions usually come in a regular pattern, gradually get closer together, and gradually increase in intensity. The frequency of te contractions is measured from the beginning of the one contraction to the beginning of the next contraction; the duration refers to the length  of one contraction; and the intensity refers to the strength of the contraction|`|W03Uc369aa	contractions causes it to dilate|`|YmEGCGtnaa	contractions that are strong enough make your cervix stretch and dilate|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ive always been told BOTH babies head on cervix and contractions<br>  googled it and yep its both <br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_causes_the_cervix_to_dilate_during_labor" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_causes_th...</a>
0do2ixtWaa	I asked the same question to my doctor and she told me that yes they do slow down BUT you need to feel 6 movements with in a 2 hour period and if you don't get 6 movements go and drink a glass of cold water or eat something and try and poke your belly to get the baby to move and if you still don't get 6 movements than you need to go to  your Labour and Delivery ward. I have this same problem and Im being put though NST's every week and ultrasounds every 2 weeks. My doctor said no matter how many times you show up at your hospital it is better to be safe than sorry! So if you don't get 6 movements with in 2 hour span than please please go to your L & D ward and get looked at. I had my son at 31 weeks and he had to stay in the NICU for 2 months.. it wasn't a pleasant adventure! Take Care and Good Luck hun.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	All babies are different.  They also develop sleep patterns while they're in there too, so maybe he's just sleepin sometimes.  My doctor told me if I don't feel him move for 24 hrs then call the hosp.  Also, if you drink something with sugar, like kool aid or something and lay on your left(?) side for an hour you should feel around 10 movements from him.  You should google that.  Don't be afraid to call the L&D though, thats what they're there for.|`|5DJcir9saa	Yes, some babies are just more active than others.  As long as you feel some movement, you have nothing to worry about.|`|AA10254927	There's no hard and fast "magic number" for movements. Some babies move the most while u are sleeping. Some move in a way, that you cant feel them much. Yet another reason why you could be feeling little is "anterior placenta" where the placenta muffles your babie's kicks. <br>  Dont worry so much unless ur doc senses any trouble!<br>  Goodluck and Congrats!|`|9CCXPGXqaa	yes this is normal.  Your baby is getting bigger so there isn't as much room to move around.  and maybe your little one isnt very active right now and is relaxing :)  Just make sure that you do feel movement during the day.  If you go a day w.out feeling the baby you need to go in.  Mine always moved when I was on my side or when I got in the bathtub. :)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Babies go through sleep cycles also and the bigger they get the less room they have to be moving around as much.|`|qIltNbbgaa	its okay as long as you feel 10movements in 2hours. you should be counting them often and recording them. At least thats what I had to do my last pregnancy and this pregnancy. Your supposed to start at 28weeks.
3F8f1SoQaa	try to see if you can give him a 1/2 or 3/4 dose of pain medication to make sure he is pain free at night. If not, see if you can give him some benedryl before bed instead. I KNOW for a fact that benedryl is used as a mild sedative for children and elderly ( I am a pharmacy technician and I volunteered in a childrens hospital for a year). You can also try positioning his leg with pillows at night to help him stay in a more comfortable position--a pillow bunched up under his knee might  really help.<br>  <br>  As for needing to relearn how to walk...I think you may have misunderstood what the doctor said. When my 19 month old son was in a body cast for 5 weeks the doctor told me that it could be "up to a month" before he walked correctly. He did not need therapy at all ( but I know some children will require therapy, but it did take him about 4-6 weeks to walk straight and not limp. I think if he takes it slow he should be able to do simple things to strengthen his leg within a week or so after the cast comes off. Since my son was so young he stood up holding on to the furniture and our hands.|`|A3fYo8eYaa	Okay the reason he's not sleeping is because his leg has to be straight so he can't move. He musn't be used to the position because I'm sure it's not the position he usually sleeps in. <br>  There's not much exercising he can do with a long leg cast, but, try and bend it up and down if he can. If it hurts, stop and rest. Don't force the leg to do something it's not capable of.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, exercise the leg as often as you can.  And the exercise will help your son sleep better.  Ask the doctor what exercises would be appropriate.<br>  <br>  Taking him off the pain pills will disturb his sleep for 5-7 days, but he will adjust to that.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	my little brother broke his leg when he was six months old he is now 9 he still has alot of pain in it when he sleeps or when the wheather is bad|`|brSfRLspaa	take that silly cast off and make him walk the little whiner|`|AA10118929	Not sure how to help you with your problem.  But have another suggestion to help improve his well being and mood.  They say decorating the cast will help improve his mental outlook.  Try something like casttoos and let him become an artist with his cast.  This may help his mood.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://orthotape.com/casttoo.asp" rel="nofollow">http://orthotape.com/casttoo.asp</a>|`|UX0Ys5bKaa	yes when the cast is off let him exercisie but take it<br>    one step at a time or u could take him to  physical therapy?<br>  <br>     HOPE HE GETS WELLL|`|8TmK8Qklaa	how did a 6 year old break his leg?<br>  <br>  Tell your physician that your child can't sleep since he went off the pain meds and ask what he can have to help him sleep.<br>  <br>  Children's Tylenol might help some with no long term problems.<br>  <br>  After a break you need physical therapy to improve your range of motion again, strengthening the muscles yes but don't just experiement be well advised by a professional who deals with children.
8t8NjjnVaa	No, no, NO!   Giving aspirin can cause a rare but very serious disease called Reye's Syndrome.<br>  <br>  If a child has a headache, you may give him ibuprofen (that's in  Motrin and Advil) or acetaminophen (that's in Tylenol).|`|qayCggxMaa	No!  I think they really need to stop labeling it like that (Baby Aspirin) too so people don't get confused.  Aspirin should never be given to children unless specifically directed by a doctor.  Use Children's Tylenol or Children's Motrin.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	NO! Never give anyone under 18 Asprin. Look up Reyes syndrome for more info...<br>  <br>  p.s. they don't call it baby asprin anymore because people thought it was made for children. It is not. They call it low dose asprin now. Also, I stand corrected. You should never give it to anyone under 16, not 18.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Motrin, Advil, Tylenol for kids.  I wouldn't give them Asprin.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	NO!!!!!!!!!<br>  Tylenol, aspirin can cause Rye's syndrome|`|dTPg4uYzaa	no give the child tylenol for pain
RzaP9bQmaa	One of thing's you can do is talk to your local Council, explain the situation to them they will try and help you the best way they can, but be aware that they might have to put you in a mother & baby unit (some Council's do use Hostels) for a little while till suitable housing turns up.<br>  <br>  I also know that some Council's do work differently from eachother, as they have there own method and system's for this situation. It can also depend on your area and what borough the local Council falls under.  In my knowledge I have learnt that some Council's are fantastic where as other's don't care. I also know if you have a job that falls in a different borough that you live in, you can ask them for help.<br>  <br>  For Example <br>  <br>  If you live in Council borough A-you can ask them for help<br>  If you work in Council borough B-you can also ask them for help <br>  <br>  (I hope the above example makes sense.) <br>  <br>  One of my Friend's was in the same situation as you are now, the only differences was that her partner asked her to leave when she was 31 weeks gone.  She also went to her local Council for help, and the outcome was that she finds a flat through a private letting agencies, and her rent would get paid by the Council. But like I said different areas have different ways of dealing with things. <br>  <br>  Another option you can do is rent private and pay the rent youself. <br>  <br>  The last thing I can think of to suggest, which at this moment of time might not sound like good advice, Is to talk to your parents ask them for help. If it be to move back in or for them to help you with looking for a place to live. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and if you need to ask anything I more than happy to answer. <br>  <br>  P.s Some Council might ask for prove that you are having a baby. I know the bump would be a huge give away! but they still might want it on paper.  When I was pregnant this is what they wanted from me. In the end me and the other half rent private.|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	the short answer? no!<br>  The council are stretched to their limits and so a baby unit or tempory accomodation is your only option! I wish i got a mother and baby unit when i had my first instead of tempory accomodation which is far worse!!! mother and baby units are a flat of your own within a complex which has play rooms and things you can if you choose attend or not.<br>  Whislt in them you are put on the urgent on the housing list as the mother and baby units are so expensive for the council to fund as are the waiting lists for people to come out of temp accomodation into them.<br>  If I were you I would go into mother and baby whilst its on offer! i waited 7months in temp accomodation to be housed with a newborn, you will be housed a lot quicker going into a unit than being at a friends house|`|a7pgX1W8aa	Try to go to your states Department of Human Resources and see if they can help you. I know that in Michigan when you have kids and you stay in a shelter for one night and then go to DHS they can find you a home almost right away because they consider it an emergency and all you have to do is prove you were there. I don't know if the same thing applies to a person who is pregnant. Before you do that check with DHS on what you need to do. The state is there to help you and they should be with all the taxes we pay. I am sorry to hear about the situation with your parents, that sucks. Parents should be there for you no matter what. I hope this helps you. Take Care of yourself.|`|vdVh4dsvaa	theres always adoption, <br>  and if your not stable or without a job or partner that might be better.<br>  and you can ask for an open adoption <br>  maybe try talking to your parents<br>  and grandparent, aunts, any family members<br>  that may take you in..<br>  <br>  but im sure you can ask your doctor for ideas <br>  and he/she may help<br>  or look on line for different units or anything <br>  but i would say talk to your doctor.<br>  esp with you being so young <br>  im sure they have something<br>  or adoption is always there.<br>  even tho im against all that.<br>  but i guess youd have a good reason.,<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  goodluck<br>  oh and congrats!|`|o4kkU2kSaa	Why don't you try and talk it out with your parents.

lRq81lu7aa	I would start the middle of March.  But there are those out there that believe it is superstitious to buy anything until the baby is born, but I didn't do that.<br>  <br>  Start with the basics, like the crib and/or bassinet, the changing table, and crib sheets and blankets.  Get some zip front sleepers, diapers, wipes and diaper rash ointment just in case.  Then get bottles, 4oz and 8 oz if you are bottle feeding.  Get the baby bath tub and the shampoo and soap.<br>  <br>  That should get you started.  Also with the economy now, try the consignment shops for clothes.  Most stores will only take gently used, and some of the stuff I bought looked pristine.  So don't count them out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and your little one!|`|deIzFnV8aa	It depends a little bit on how you want to buy items. If you are interested in getting some of teh big items used (there are lots of great deals on Craigslist, at garage sales, and in consignment shops, and baby items are often lightly used), then you should start looking for those items now, because they come and go.  This is how we looked for the crib, mattress, car seat, and high chair.<br>  <br>  You should also buy any items that will be hard to carry or hard to set up before too far into the third trimester, so you are able to help carry them safely (and w/o a big belly to get in the way).<br>  <br>  For smaller items, I would wait until after any baby showers that might be planned. Its nice to have them somewhat earlyish for this reason (if you have any say in that). You will find that people will be very generous (esp if its your first) and may buy you bigger items that you thought you would have to get yourself (bouncy chair, swing, mobile, monitor, etc).<br>  <br>  For clothes, I would only get the absolute essentials at any point, because people are going to give you clothes both at the shower and at the time of birth.  We didn't really need to purchase anything but undershirts and a sleep sack in the end - onsies, socks, hats, bibs, burp clothes, and recieving blankets just seemed to come pouring in!|`|h7HtnTXFaa	Well they say to wait untill your 12 week scan... but, when i found out i was pregnant, i left it a week then went crazy with shopping. People told me that i can buy too much, but i ignored them, and have ended up with far too much for my daughter! (but she is worth every penny)<br>  It varys from person to person, but i was glad i got myself prepared as my little one decided to come 4 weeks early. You start shopping whenever you feel ready. All the best. x x x|`|bspRfskYaa	I would start getting things now just in case you go early or in case you get too tired towards the end of your pregnancy.<br>  All you need to start with is:<br>  10 babygros<br>  10 vests<br>  4 packs of diapers (best to be prepared in case you don't want to be out and about)<br>  4 packs of wet wipes<br>  cream<br>  2 x blankets<br>  car seat<br>  crib (blankets etc)<br>  baby bath/shampoo<br>  sponge<br>  everything else can wait and I have heard its bad luck to bring a stroller into the house before the baby is born - just an old wives tale.<br>  Hope this helps, good luck!|`|GpR5MI5raa	im also due in may and ive already started. If your having a baby shower you should definitely register soon. I just felt like its easier spending a little bit every time i go out, as opposed to buying everything at once when your 9 months pregnant. May will be here before we know it!

I home school them so I teach them all sorts of things.  We got a book talking about where babies come from and what happens when mommy gets pregnant.  They love knowing and we talk about when it was them, and they love to talk to my belly and tell their little brother all about what's going on out here.  The only things we changed from the book is that we home birth, so the part about the hospital we explained as what will happen at home.|`|0YTuN71aaa	My baby brother was 8 when I had my first and 10 when I had my second.  He already knew that the baby was in a uterus (although he had no idea what a uterus was).  I basically explained the basics without too much detail. This time around he asked how a couple can stop having kids if they don't want them anymore? lol.  That was a tough one, cause I had to go into more detail.  But he seemed unphased by it  - I think some of his friends have already started to talk about sex.|`|AA11508703	Visual demonstrations are proven to be more effective teaching methods to children.
rTACLd3Saa	Most hospitals have a website that parents can post their newborns picture on.  The one I delivered at did, but I'm in CT.  I didn't choose to post her pic but it was a free option.  You could set it up with a security code so only friends and family could view her or without a code and everyone could see her.  Check with the hospital where the baby is delivered.|`|x7vTKP24aa	check the hospitals website where the baby was born... they usually have "virtual nursery" you can see the babies born there by date|`|QoenvlFuaa	Here in AR most hospitals have their own websites that post pics of newborns (assuming the parents agree to it).

Ka52nbhNaa	Take a pregnancy test . . . most women do not experience pregnancy symptoms until 4 - 8 weeks pregnant . . . at which time it should show up on a test.  If you are no where near having your period or are not late, then it is most likely the flu.<br>  <br>  Good luck and feel better!|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	If you have the flu you will probably run fever and you will probably feel achy.  If you are pregnant you might feel nauseous and you will miss your period. If your period is late then you should take a test.  If it isn't time for your period then it is probably just a stomach bug because you probably won't feel symptoms like nausea until you are at least 6-8 weeks along.|`|VjlHgKEkaa	I would suggest for you to go see a doctor hun. <br>  Is your period late?<br>  Either way you want to know what is going on with you.

TXddP0uxaa	First you have to realize that your father's feelings toward you have nothing to do with what you do or what your sister does or anything else.  This is his problem.  If the perspective you have on your father is true (that he likes your sister more than you), there is nothing you can do about it.  What you CAN do is stop blaming yourself and stop trying to chase after his love.  Seek professional help to move past this.|`|2YKzN0Fraa	I think your last comment may have some significance........."By the way, my brother and I are "real", and my sister is "half"- she has a different mom".......Maybe your brother and yourself are "half" and your sister is actually the "real" one to him. Or maybe being that she is the "half" opposed to "real" child he is trying to make up for that? I dont know, just some thoughts to ponder. Either way I hope things get better for your relationship with your father real soon! Best of luck!|`|yYOh0DUjaa	I haven't spoken to my parents in over a month. But I'm 15 and I use to live with them so it's a little different for me.<br>  <br>  When parents stop talking to their children for whatever reason, it's immature. You shouldn't just abandon your kids that way! Or even favor just one. <br>  <br>  You can't make your dad talk to you. Forget about him for a little while. I know it hurts. Try going to therapy. It's really helping me out. You can stop blaming yourself. It's not your fault at all! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Okay when I was 16 (I'm 23 now) My dad stopped talking to me.   He wouldn't speak or even look at me for 3 months.   (I was very disrespectful toward him oneday and then he stopped talking to me)<br>  <br>  I feel that is very immature.  You don't treat you child like that no matter their age.<br>  <br>  I would let it go for now but keep trying to build the relationship back.<br>  <br>  I know its hard.<br>  <br>  I don't get any support from my mom and dad but my sister is up there with the president in their eyes.....<br>  <br>  My sister is a half.

He is proud I bet, he just can't show it. With your sister, he still gets to be more like a daddy, helping her out. Perhaps he just doesn't know how to connect with you?
OPTDFRuzaa	you can have breast milk in your breast for up to 2 years after you stop breastfeeding even if it was for a short time. i had milk in mine for about 8 months after breastfeeding for 6 months.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	That I would go with just a hormonal shift and your breasts just leaking whatever was in there.  It is common to leak during pregnancy but you don't normally start leaking before you even know if your pregnant or not.
g6IgHavwaa	yea sounds like movements alright!!<br>  congrats on the pregnancy, hope everything goes well.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	You are probably feeling the baby with subsequent pregnancies you feel them earlier. Every one thinks am crazy Ive been feeling this one since about 9 week but he bumped hubbys hand yesterday so yea am further along now but I know what I felt am not crazy lol|`|aHLUS6i2aa	congrats im 17 weeks too with my 3rd baby, i was a bit unsure but i think it prob is. i feel mine when im doing house work, etc. i feel him/her more when chilled out on the sofa though.|`|Itk0TYjSaa	I'm 17 weeks with my third pregnany also and I've felt fluttering since about 12 weeks. BUT just last week, they turned into much harder kicks that I can feel just standing up too. My husband can even feel them... Just today I was able to lead my doctor on where to put the heartbeast monitor based on where the baby kicked. I am amazed at how strong they feel this early on! So I'm sure it's very possible that's what you're feeling!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	With every additional pregnancy you can feel the baby move sooner and sooner.  I remember with this pregnancy I felt stuff around 13/14 weeks and usually if I sat cross legged and bent over (I crowded her so I could try and feel her move)|`|2z3lTB2Raa	It sounds like you are. With every pregnancy you can be able to feel the baby move earlier.
xCifmFfkaa	If you've been on Ortho and then switched, you've basically been on BC constantly and so I wouldn't worry too much about it.<br>  <br>  And I'm not sure who told you that you can't take EC while on BC--but they were wrong! If you can get your hands on it and it'll make you feel better, I say go for it. No harm in being safe.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I think you are safe.  I wouldn't worry about it as long as you were past the first week, and you took the pills consistently.  I don't know if it would hurt to take the morning after pill or not, but you should be safe if you are on the placebo pills.  I take Tri-cyclen Lo and I usually get my period on the 4th day of the placebos and I never use backup.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	So you already went through the whole pack of active birth control pills and were on the sugar pills? I may have misunderstood but if that's what you are saying I wouldn't worry about it, you will be fine.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	No I'm pretty sure you're fine because you're on your birth control.  I really don't think you have a need for the morning after pill.  As far as taking it the same time everyday, they mean morning, afternoon or night...not at 1:45p on the dot or anything that literal.  You're fine.  Good for you, using both pills and condoms...you couldn't get more responsible than that!|`|sXU3RrfWaa	Youre right about not taking it at the same time as BC. I'd call your doctor or planned parenthood to find out what steps to take from here.<br>  <br>  Since he came inside of you, you absolutely could get pregnant. But if you were taking your pill correctly, than you likely are in the clear since that hormone is in your system.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	As long as you take your pill at the same time every day, you should be fine.  Plus, it was probably too late in your cycle for you to conceive this month anyway.  Try not to stress.|`|AA12314337	In a typical cycle, you ovulate on day 14. You probably were not ovulating last night, so you should be okay.|`|DxoodgOtaa	youre prolly ok.
n1vKoto7aa	Put a bathing suit on over her diaper and under her clothes.<br>  <br>  Put her in a sleeper with no feet (or the feet cut off) backward, so she can't unzip it.<br>  <br>  Put her in overalls. <br>  <br>  Do this for a week or so until the habit breaks, then try regular clothes. If she still tries to take it off, start over again.|`|1s3nddaYaa	honestly,. a lot of people say duct tape lol|`|AA11540024	simple answer <br>  don't put one on her. Put regular undies on her. I never used those things on my kids because they're gross.|`|PqPc10Fgaa	Taking off clothes or a diaper is a habit that can crop up in your toddler around 18 to 24 months. It can seem funny at first but will probably quickly shift to annoying and tedious. Children may be motivated by the attention that undressing gets, so most experts recommend minimizing your reaction to the behavior. Simply re-dress (or re-diaper) your child while telling her she has to keep his clothes or diaper on. Also, remember that this is usually a short-lived phase.<br>  <br>  Tips to Keep Them Dressed...<br>  <br>  You can try putting her clothes or diaper on backwards in the hopes that it'll thwart his Houdini act. You could also offer him "naked time," where he can run around the house clothes-free for a half hour before, say, bath time. <br>  <br>  If your child takes off her diaper, always make sure to dress him with a onesie (or other clothes) over the diaper, which will make it harder for her to remove it.......<br>  <br>  If your child is in daycare, the sudden need to be free from clothes can comically become the trend of a whole room. Don't be surprised if one day you pick up your child and all he's wearing in the play yard are shoes and a pull-up. Be sure to work with your child's caregivers to make sure that you're in sync with how they're trying to manage the issue. <br>  <br>  Safety Note...........<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that children who aren't completely potty-trained and regularly remove their diapers or pull-ups pose a health risk to their peers, as well as their caregivers.|`|c59c86235cce6e2a5c920dacd712e7c2aa	Take it from her... Change her... Put her in the corner and let her know thats not okay. Be persistent and she'll soon learn that there are consequences to not listening.<br>     Having said that... I was spanked and that usually worked for my kids... I dont have time to keep changing them so I pop their hands and they know mommy's serious. I put them in the corner and I leave them there. Afterwards, they're just fine|`|tBx1M0g9aa	okay get her a baby doll and put a diaper on it so she can play with the doll|`|WKt58GYLaa	I got advice from a few of my siblings that had the same problem.  It worked for them, and it worked with my child.  Duct tape!!  It sounds funny, but try wrapping some around the pullup or diaper(not the skin of course).  I also like the idea of putting on coveralls, or some kind of outfit where she can't get to her pull up off.  Good luck!
DQ8WR6CXaa	Okay, I am VERY sure she is NOT pregnant. <br>  Is her cycle regular? Say around 28 days?<br>  <br>  If so, do not worry. She was not in fertile days; she was not ovulating. Also, you did not ejaculate. It's a very common thing that people believe that there is sperm in pre-ejaculate. However, I have taken many human sexuality courses that do dismiss the common belief. SEVERAL studies have dismissed this theory. I was even surprised to read all those studies. However, there can be sperm in pre-ejaculate if you ejaculated the day prior & all of it was not secreted. On the other hand, there is always a chance of getting someone pregnant as soon as you insert the penis in a vagina.<br>  <br>  BUT, honestly, do not worry. Next time just be prepared. Purchase a properly fitting condom or consider other contraceptives. <br>  <br>  But here's the thing. An average cycle is about 28 days. A female is ovulating/most fertile during the 2 weeks after/before your period. Though, every woman is different. From those 2 days, you have about 20% of having a successful pregnancy.<br>  <br>  So if you had sex on saturday & her period is late, the chances of her being pregnant are EXTREMELY unlikely.<br>  <br>  Stress, hormonal changes, diet & many many other factors can manipulate your period, including delays. <br>  <br>  Like I said, just be more responsible next time & perhaps become more familiar with a woman's cycle & find out the day she is ovulating. I'm not going to scold you for having sex or anything, but just be more careful!<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  ---------------------------------<br>  Addition:<br>  <br>  She COULD be pregnant if you had sex maybe 2-2 1/2 weeks ago.<br>  <br>  If you'd like I can find LOADS of professional scientific Journals/Studies that dismisses the theory that there are sperm in pre-ejaculation. These are not articles found in newspapers/google... these are scientific journals found in college databases.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------<br>  <br>  She's on the pill?! oh geeeeze. You are FINE. She is NOT pregnant. Even if she wasn't, likelihood was very very very low.|`|VXSjZQc3aa	i've had this problem but i never took it up with a doctor it just ran late and showed up about 2-3days after the date it normally starts.. <br>  and no matter how how little the *** amount she can get pregenant<br>  and if your active why isnt she on the pill?|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	She was at the gyno office Friday and they said she wasn't pregnant? Well they would have had a positive result by then I would think... if she were already late. <br>  <br>  When I first found out I was pregnant it felt like my period was going to come and it never did. I had cramps and headaches too. <br>  <br>  Looks like you have to give it a few days. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|04F4149yaa	She could be pregnant. You did pre-ejaculate...<br>  <br>  Let her take the test.<br>  <br>  If she is pregnant, look into adoption or abortion.
wy5SiCS2aa	your only choices are not just c-section or no pain medications. There's a million options in between. Doctors don't like to do c-sections unless they're medically necessary. If your doctor doesn't listen to you then switch doctors, it's not too late. Plus the doctor really has no say in it, it's your wishes once you get to the hospital. Ask for pain meds, get an epidural. Ask the nurses when is the right time to get your epidural and they'll take care of everything. Women used to DIE in the old days from giving birth. They have pain medicines that don't hurt the baby in any way whatsoever (no matter what some people might say) but you have to let them know you want it.|`|kuHE3z2Maa	I would ask for an epidural. It makes childbirth almost painless.|`|AA12041870	You are only offered a C-section if it is absolutely necessary.  Since all births are different, you may find that this second one is a piece of cake.  For your sake, I hope it is.|`|dgRTkccBaa	if you think a c-section doesn't hurt you're dead wrong.  The recovery is very hard, it hurts to even stand for weeks after a c-section.<br>  Ask for an epidural, you'll be glad you did.  Good luck!!
lN0GkKgaaa	Tell your brother to get his child under control, or you will have to ask them to leave, because your education is important to you and you can't study or do your work when his children get out of control.<br>  <br>  It's not your job to discipline HIS kid. So you need to communicate with your brother. And also be sympathetic as well because children going through divorce don't know how to process everything so they act out.|`|A0PPXS5uaa	smack them on the butt no where eles you could damage if your not carfeull use common sense when spanking a child|`|BljwgBNUaa	A BELT AND A CHANCLA!|`|ggTRs3Paaa	i would say, you give him a certain time limit on the video games, 15-30 minutes. when times up, he gets off with NO arguments. if he argues or yells, take away his time for the next day. but, if he does something good, you could reward him with a few extra minutes of video games, or icecream :)|`|15qceXaOaa	make him go to his room or something when he demands something an DONT give him what he wants.

My child doesn't need to be raised in that drama.  It'll be a cold day in you-know-where before I ever take him back too!

pT7jrsAgaa	We had this game where they would lay on their tummies and "Archibald the Ant" would go walking starting with their toes all the way to their heads.

We start at the bottom of the stairs, and then count to 3 and go!<br>  <br>  We run to our rooms, change into jammies as fast as we can, brush our teeth and jump into his bed. The first person into his bed gets to pick out the book to read!<br>  <br>  If the same person wins 2 nights in a row, that person gets to pick out dessert for the next nights dinner! Its so much fun. <br>  <br>  He usually wins the race up the stairs - given, he is 4 years old and I'm 29 weeks pregnant, he is a bit faster than me!|`|xESfrW1Qaa	sing a bedtime song, read a bedtime story, play a little game to wear the kids out so they can fall a sleep faster, tons of things!|`|0vLU2GGGaa	we do bedtime story, i do not have many good suggestion for new activities, maybe playing board games with older kids?  It is hard to think of a game that is fun and calm them down at the same time.|`|9F0iuuMYaa	You should do something like a play. You get a bedtime story that the kids make up themselves and then you act it out for them. Or tell a story with music to make them go to sleep .
QSodlfMraa	be there for her, that is hard what she went through.<br>  how old are you because this is in the adolescent section.<br>  and you have a kid not judging just asking.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Keep in touch with her.|`|CNB7WITFaa	maybe you can try to call her.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Call her. Go to a florist and have flowers sent to the hospital.
PuQyYMM8aa	Some kids go through that. If you have already talked to the mom, and nothing has changed, then you need to talk to the child. I would sit down very nice with the child and explain to her that what she is doing is stealing. Let her know that you don't allow stealing in your house. If they want to borrow a toy, all they have to do is ask first. If they keep taking things without asking, than they won't be permitted to play at your house anymore. Be nice but firm. She may not fully understand what she is doing is wrong.|`|Si9hhcW1aa	There is really nothing more you can do than talk to the parent of the child who is stealing. You can let it be known that the thief is not welcome at your house and then stick to it. One of these days it might be something bigger and worth a lot of money that they take.|`|ntfOcTnWaa	She is probably stealing for attention.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Confront her parents about it, and say that if she can't stop stealing from your daughter that they can no longer play together, and tell her that she should teach her daughter some manners.|`|d740a1806ac12ea6cc4e2e9a03202502aa	Next time she comes over try to catch her in the act. Then explain that it's wrong to take things that belong to other people without their permission and if she does it again she will not be aloud to come over again for a while.|`|1UOnrM1Maa	Why is this happening? Because the kid's 5, hun. Because they either haven't been taught not to steal, or because they are spoiled and are under the impression that everything belongs to them. <br>  <br>  There's not much you can do. This isn't prison. You can't check their pockets everytime. Besides; it's not your job. Tell the kid's parents to have a talk with them. <br>  <br>  Is your daughter friends with this 5-year old child? Perhaps that 5 year old needs to find some friends of his/her own, or find something else to entertain him/herself. He/she is stealing stuff to see if he/she will get caught, or to play with it later. Either way, it's for personal entertainment.<br>  <br>  Hope my answer helps.|`|926VwJisaa	Try talking to her parents again, explain why you consider it's wrong, don't make a big deal of it (try to keep things calmed) in front of kids, it could be just a phase, but the important part is that she needs to understand why it isn't right to take other people's stuff...  <br>  <br>  Some moms take the best actions in apologizing and returning things and teaching lessons to their kids about stealing, others just don't !!<br>  <br>  next time, she goes to your house, hide every small piece and only leave big toys that cannot be hidden ...|`|AA11210211	Seriously I would have a chat with the child's mom about it,EVERY child goes through this phase.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'm not sure. Maybe her older sister has done this before,and now she's copying the behavior elsewhere.<br>  <br>  ..The only thing I can think of is,to check her pockets before leaving your house. And tell her not to take things from your house without asking.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	If you talked to the mom about this already, has she spoken to her child about stealing?  Explain to the mom that if her kid continues to steal, she will probably end up in jail eventually.  If the kid is still stealing, just tell the mother that her kids are no longer allowed in your home.  Explain to your daughter why the other kids aren't allowed over.|`|AA10526033	My 6 yr old daughters best friend does the exact same thing and tries to be sneaky about it! It drives me nuts but her mom allows her to do. she once stole 18 dollars from her 8 yr old half brother and her mom bragged about it. there is no point in talking to this mom as she thinks her daughter does no wrong. once i saw her daughter hand her money and say my daughter gave it to her my daughter said she didnt but the mom still took it and told me the only reason she steals is because they are poor LOL those people have more than we do!|`|bXkvtg7maa	I think you should speak to her parents and let them know whats going on if u have already done that then maybe she doesnt have those certain things at home or if u see her doing it then tell her stop or explain to ur daughter that if shes her taking stuff that isnt hers then tell her to not do that.|`|UADLdXBtaa	I think every kid goes through something like this and she will probably grow out of it. It would be a good idea to talk to her mom and maybe have her tell the little girl that she will not be able to go with her sister to play at their friend's house if she keeps taking things. The next time she comes over, have her empty her pockets- pants and coat- before she leaves. If she gets caught like this she will probably be embarrassed and it is unlikely that she will do it again. She's five so it's not like she's entitled to privacy about what's in her pockets.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Plan B causes your period to be off a lot of times. I guess there is still a chance of pregnancy because it is not 100% effective, but I would not worry too much about it.<br>  <br>  The link below has some pretty good info about it!|`|YlLmAADraa	it can mess with your period.<br>  i took it one time when i was 16 and it messed around with my period. the problem with it is that it is a large amount of the hormone in birth control pills being put into your body at once.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I'm confused...did you take the pill on the same day you were expecting your period because if you did that was dumb because you wouldn't have gotten pregnant.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Plan B usually causes irregular periods. You should have a regular period in the next month, if not see your doctor.|`|2n93DU71aa	HI. I have used the morning after pill and if you read on the box it says that it can mess with your monthly cycle. But if you don't get it within a week or so I would test. Remember that that pill is not 100% it has worked for me in the past but nothing is full proof.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	The morning pill messes up your period its one of the side effects. If you took it withing 72 hours of the intercourse then you should be fine, but its going to take a little while for your period to get back to normal so dont worry.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	The morning after pill can mess with your periods when I took it I was over 1 week late. Also stressing you are pregnant can stop your period from coming x<br>  Good luck hope this helped x
Q05rrSX4aa	First, I would confirm if you are pregnant or not by taking a test, or seeing your doctor for a blood test.  Spotting in early pregnancy is common to have.  If you are too early for your period and you get light pinkish/brownish spotting that could be a sign that you are pregnant.  But it could also be your period starting.  Many women have spotting in early pregnancy, where are many don't.  I had spotting around my 6th week and everything was fine.  But I would take a test first to be sure.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	When you miscarry in early pregnancy you bleed like a normal but slightly more painful period. You would know if you miscarried. Call and make an appointment with your doctor or take a test if you think you are pregnant.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	I don't think u need to worry I think this is just your starting your periods x|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	It could implantation bleeding if you are pregnant. Go get a pregnancy test, they you will know for sure.|`|jKz63XCfaa	Take a pregnancy test or go to the doctor.<br>  Common sense.|`|x5OHjdtmaa	GO TO UR DOCTOR....

9scpRClxaa	At that age, solids are for experience and experimentation, not nutrition.  He should be getting his nutrition from breastmilk or formula.  Is he a really independent baby?  He may not like you trying to spoon foods into his mouth.  Try setting some things onto his high-chair tray (like diced canned or steamed and cooled veggies, cheerios, cut up banana--that kind of stuff) and see if he'd be more interested in self-feeding.  Just about a teaspoon at a time so he can't make a huge mess.|`|d8SJiabkaa	Put it on the fork and "airplane it" around while making "vroom vroom" noises. Dip it down and poke him on the lips with the fork and then take off again, try to make it a fun experience for him. Keep dipping down until he opens his mouth.<br>  <br>  Try something "creamy", such as soups. It's like a liquid, like baby food, but still a bit solid. Try tomato soups or clam chowder. <br>  <br>  If this (or something like it) doesn't work, you should wait.<br>  <br>  I also recommend consulting his doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Alyssa|`|E5CnUdhsaa	has he ever enjoyed something at all youve given him ie whats he most likely to eat. personally whatever that is id stick withthat for a week or so. dont push it, offer it if he pushes it away fine leave it there and try again the next day...it does happen but he will soon eat something. try not to worry or stress over it as he will pick up on your concern and flat out refuse anyway. feeding and starting solids takes alot patience sometimes. but dont be disheartened if he doesnt take to it staright away its normal. if he has been eating and suddnly stopped it could be teething and he just doesnt want to hurt his already sensitive gums:)|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	honestly just keep trying, when he's ready he will let you know.  You can't make him eat if he doesn't want it.|`|e5e70239b695f08f889d12274b993adaaa	Just to reassure you my son is 7 months old too and I was just going to ask the very same question. He just isn't interested in anything on a spoon and clamps his mouth shut and turns away. My health visitor says not to worry and just keep him up with formula milks and maybe try milky things like yoghurts and shakes. I get so worried though as you just want to see them eat normally. It seems to be a boy thing as friends with boys seem to have similar stories.|`|I2n0fNFAaa	you need to talk to a pediatrician. he should have started at least wanting to much sooner. also, keep trying until you can see his dr because by 6mo old, a baby needs more nutrients than are just found in milk in order to be healthy.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Leave him alone. You cannot make/force him to eat. At 7 months solids aren't necessary because he still should be getting his main source of nutrition from breast milk or formula.<br>  <br>  He may just not be ready for them. Or if this is something new he may not like what you're offering. Teething can also affect a baby's appetite. In any case I'd relax with it for a few weeks and then try again.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	U can't make him eat solids, some babies aren't ready for solids at that age.   At 7 months old all he needs is in breast milk or formula.  Solid food is more for practice eatin from a spoon more than anything, esp. if they don't really like to eat the solid food like ur son.  Keep tryin it and he'll eventually start acceptin it, just don't push it cuz that could turn him off solid food even more.  Just try a lil everyday and if he won't take it after a few tries then just leave it alone for the day and try the next day.  Once he will take it and is doin good with a spoonful or 2 a day u can slowly increase the amount and give it to him more than once a day.  <br>  If ur really concerned though that he’s not eatin enough breast milk or formula a day and so that’s why u want him to start eatin solid foods then I’d talk to ur pediatrician about it, and see what he/she thinks would be best.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.
kgE96Nhcaa	Your lmp calculates out your due date to Sept 15th, however your MD measure you out to Sept 20th.  Usually if it is less than 7 days they stick with what your lmp calculates to not what you are measuring.  So you should go with 9/15/09.  You should see your OB again around 11-13 weeks if you want the 1st trimester genetic screening done.  Your 2nd trimester would begin 3/10 and 3rd would begin 6/23.  This is how my OB calculates with the 7 day rule.  They only adjust if outside the 7 days even if you measure differently go by the start of your LMP.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Well originally they will go by your LMP, so according to that you would be 11 weeks tomorrow.  Conception most likely did not occur on December 9th, so when you get a ultrasound that will determine the fetal age, which can be 2 weeks earlier.  When I was pregnant my due date change 2 weeks when I had my ultrasound.  I thought I was 20 weeks and It turned out I was only 18....its just because they go by your LMP.  And you can never be 100% sure when you ovulate.  Remember that fetal age can be different then when you think you ovulated.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	When your doctor said you wre 8 weeks 4 days that means you are 8 weeks 4 days. They count pregnancy from the FIRST day of your LAST period. You are 8 weeks 4 days.<br>  <br>  Sept 20th is the right due date. The other dates you listed are the starts of your trimesters and they seem right to me too...|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You would go with the 8 weeks and 4 days.  The measurements normally equal what you are from your last period.  I measured exactly to the day of my last period at my last sonogram.
WXExyAlWaa	You should not marry someone because you're manipulated into it. Ever. You'll be utterly miserable, and once you married her she'd just want something else. No one is responsible for anyone else's happiness - she is clearly emotionally unstable and blaming you for her own misery. You are a human being and incapable of making her happy, only she can do that.<br>  <br>  The best thing you could do is try to get her into therapy, but you might not be able to manage it if she doesn't think she needs it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Simple. You do not have to marry her just because she is pregnant. This is not 1955. :) You don't have to "be with" the mother if you don't want to. Just be there for your child and help support your child. You are in no way obligated to try to be in a relationship with this women. If you did marry her and were unhappy your child would know that and not be a happy child. Unhappy homes are not the place to raise a baby.<br>  <br>  ADD: I am the child of divorce and WE ALL were a lot happier after my parents got divorced. They were not happy and tried to hide that fact but failed miserably. You cannot hide that from your children. FYI I am a perfectly well balanced happy person who would have it no other way. I think of my parents being married and cringe.|`|CFnkrvyvaa	I don't think you are being heartless. If you marry her, things will end up bad in the long run. No one needs to be with someone who makes them unhappy. If you are worried about the well being of the baby, fight for custody once it's born. Don't let a guilt trip force you into doing something you don't want to.|`|YlLmAADraa	are you even sure this girl is pregnant?<br>  it just sounds like she is trying to use a pregnancy to keep you in her life. i think its pathetic when a man walks out on his child but this girl is making it impossible for you to be part of its life (if it even exsists) i would haul her @$$ to court for this child. if not then just stay away and forget about her.|`|YzUPmWTBaa	No, not at all. I do think the reason she's flipping out like this, is because she is scared, feels alone, and has pregnancy hormones! The hormones alone can drive someone crazy. I guess she never planned on being a single mom, and is doing and saying anything she can to get you to marry her. Maybe try telling her that you can think about marriage after the baby comes. That way she wont harm or end the pregnancy, and after she delivers she will be able to think like a normal human being again- not a hormonal psycho. Very tough situation, good luck.|`|lCxcfisfaa	I really think she wants you to fight for her. Girls play stupid games like that sometimes. She's got your baby in her belly - and knows she has control.<br>  <br>  I would say "sit down and talk to her about your concerns" but this doesnt sound like the type of girl who can do that ... otherwise you wouldn't be in this mess and there would probably be a ring on her finger.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	You should never marry someone you don't love.  It is a horrible idea to marry her just because she is pregnant.  Talk to a lawyer and draw up a custody/child support arrangement now.  If this girl is truly suicidal, then you need to talk to her doctor and let him know that you think she might hurt herself or the baby.
EV1Z1AWCaa	No, because female and male twins come from 2 separate egg cells<br>  <br>  Identical twins are from 1 egg cell that splits<br>  When something goes wrong during that time you get siamese twins|`|AA10329269	No. Siamese twins occur from identical twins that come from the same egg. Boy and girl twins can not be identical.|`|2LfMvxwBaa	I think they can, but it would be very rare. I heard of a case once of 2 identical twins, one of whom was a guy and the other a girl. The original cell had split oddly, meaning that she ended up with only an X chromosome, while her brother had the XY. So yes, in theory this could happen with siamese twins as well, it's just so rare that it hasn't happened yet.|`|BJ4O0acoaa	No. Conjoined twins are identical twins. Identical twins come from the same fertilized egg which splits in two and then creates two children. With conjoined twins, the fertilized egg doesn't quite split entirely in two, so the twins are joined. By the time the egg separates it already has a set of genetic information included in which is whether or not the twins will be boys or girls. <br>  <br>  Sets of twins who come from two different fertilized eggs are called "fraternal". Fraternal twins can be boy/boy, girl/girl or boy/girl since they come from two different eggs each with their own genetic information. <br>  <br>  By the way the term "Siamese Twins" comes from a famous set of conjoined twins who were from Siam. They traveled with a circus as side-show "freaks" and their title of "Siamese Twins: became famous. It also, unfortunately, became the name that a lot of people use for conjoined twins. The two terms are not interchangable. The "Siamese Twins" were a set of brothers from Siam, this does not describe a set of sisters from Pennsylvania who are conjoined.|`|IZZ6T1Ddaa	no because they have to be identical twins. they cannot be "together" if they are in a different egg. boys and girls can not be identical twins. so, they can't be conjoined either.|`|iKxm8aL7aa	no,it is physically impossible|`|XoA6kByvaa	Conjoined or "Siamese" twins must be genetically identical.<br>  <br>  So the answer to the question is no.|`|m4nKkFDUaa	No, as they are made when one egg splits in two. They have absolutely identical DNA, ergo are of the same sex!|`|9ZkzBAQCaa	No.  They must be of the same sex and "identical".
X9Dpyrg9aa	I would say yes and hopefully yes, but if #3 didn't come any earlier than #4 might not either.|`|AA11206135	Not necessarily...

I get my hair done, thinned out, straighten, layered, highlights/low lights/colored and just style beautifully. <br>  <br>  Seeing as I won't be able to drive until this summer, my mom drives me so far. Plus when she drives me she usually gets her hair done as well. Now her hair takes an hour to do my hair takes three hours to do because of how fast and thick it grows. So after she's done she'll usually run some errands and then come back to pick me up and she'll say, "Oh wow, look your hair is so gorgeous and say she (hairstylist) did a damn good job."|`|IBfAfBx2aa	Sine I don't drive yet, my dad provides transportation and just waits there, seeing as it doesn't take long.

Most of my friends and family and other women with kids that I talk to never had them and some don't even know what they are.  They are pretty much the main thing that is making the pregnancy so miserable.|`|256cVXsmaa	I had a few incidences of braxton-hicks around 20 weeks but they weren't anything to worry about, only some light cramping/pressure.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	I felt mine around 7 months.

Why are his siblings having a hard time with him having a birthday party?  Don't they get to celebrate there birthday as well?  If they are having jealous issues then you need to sit them down and explain to them thats it their brothers birthday and soon they will get to celebrate there birthday.  If they are to young to understand then you might just have to let them sulk.  You could get them a gift as well but unless you do that for all the children on everyones birthday it doesn't seem fair to your son.|`|29BrE6tJaa	YOU BEAT DEH FAWKING SHET!!! OUT OF IT!!

DVmDWDC4aa	If you and the baby are both healthy, then it's fine to fly in the second trimester. Most airlines have a cut off date in the third trimester, the second is fine. They do however usually let you travel in the third IF you have a letter from your doctor, though airline dependent of course.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have any trouble in the second trimester at all, as long aas everything is going along normally as it should. Your doctor and the airline can confirm this - just give the airline a call.|`|QSodlfMraa	my cousin when to Jamaica when she was 4 months pregnant.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most airlines have a cut off date in which they will let a pregnant woman fly.

Wzws8v8daa	there is no set time. it depends on what is going on with you.  i'm starting on clomid this month and i've been trying for just over 4 months.  i have irregular periods so my doctor told me that i'm not ovulating so that is why he's putting me on the clomid.|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	It just depends on what your doctor thinks. You can be prescribed Clomid at any time, you can only take it a certain amount of times though. <br>  <br>  Your doctor will best know the answer to this. If you have problems ovulating you could be prescribed Clomid right away.|`|T9fek24eaa	When the doctor determines that you are not ovulating on your own. Usually a doctor will not start looking into those things until you have been actively trying for at least 1 year. Clomid is not for everyone that is experiencing problems conceiving.|`|ZdlRGYZXaa	Greetings , <br>  I'm not big on  lab created drugs so I cant answer that question . However ,  I read this in women's day magazine in 1984 and it worked for me . Some women (like myself ) get pregnant easier when we douche with a little baking soda & distilled water .<br>  Our natural fluids tend to protect ourselves and kill off the sperm before it can do its job . <br>  a little baking soda water douche neutralizes the enzyme that kills the sperm allowing us to conceive easier .After Med. Dr's told me Id never have a baby , im happy to say my son is  22 yrs old .<br>  Good Luck<br>  ps. here is a web link that was off the wall but interesting non the less.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Clomid is prescribed for women who have a diagnosed infertility problem. When women who don't need it use it, they usually end up with more than one baby . I don't recomend taking clomid unless your doctor has told you to.|`|WBw9lDG8aa	hey girl you have to try at least for a year then u get proscribed clomid or if you dont ovulate then they could give it to you right away im mean if you want clomid right away with no hassel just tell them that u've been trying for a whole year and that should do the trick good luck girl baby dust.......
AA11296427	Oooh :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Make the headlines very color full (think, a Color for each letter [ pink, blue. pink, blue...? ]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|7SCjPftKaa	It's an 8th grade poster, not a degree level research paper- I'm sure putting the editor will be fine :]<br>  <br>  Draw boarders and make the titles colourful using your pens. If you have any coloured paper, then you could rip it into jagged shapes a little bigger than each photo, stick it onto the poster and then mount the pictures on top of the pieces. It sounds weird when written down like this but it looks nice on a poster.|`|SauyxU3Eaa	I am only in 6th grade but I guess for each letter use a different color pen.

a6e7SRYzaa	Ok all these people saying that you shouldn't be having a shower since it's your second baby are being stupid. This baby is just as special as your first, and it's a celebration. If you don't want people to bring gifts have your mom say that you really don't need anything, but I'm sure they would love some diapers. Moms have the amazing ability to make anything sound good and then that way you can take the pressure off yourself. Plus since your mom is sending the invites it doesn't look like you are asking for gifts if you don't register any place. Most people will still bring gifts even if you don't ask, I know I would.|`|c6eee8ca32c8596d205d0a16a9898eb0aa	I know these are not baby shower decorations but you can still use them for your baby shower because they have cars on them i think it would be really cute to go with Disney's Cars theme... <br>  <br>  And there is not anything wrong with having another baby shower. If there is a certain things you need for this baby then you should request it in your baby shower invites so you dont get things you dont need... i hope everything works out good luck!<br>  <br>  I am having 6 Games I think let me see i fi can remember what they are.. te first one is for people to guest my pre pregnancy and current weight...

Every pregnancy deserves to be celebrated.  We had a couples shower for our first.  You can do any theme you want.  If you are both into Nascar than do that.  I'm sure you can find invites at any party place.  If you don't see anything you like than you can make them on your computer.  Add a little note in each invite stating that diapers are needed or better yet, register for them at Wal Mart or Target.  Your guests will get the message.<br>  Congrats!|`|QIUCmRFoaa	I don't know about themes, but if all you need is diapers, etc, then go register at your Wal-Mart for those few items.  Then put the Wal-Mart registry cards in the shower invites...|`|vsuXCMqzaa	My aunt put our invite something like: "Come and enjoy the association, the food and the celebration of baby so and so. Gifts are strictly optional. Baby so and so has received LOTS of clothes from excited friends and family. If you would like to bring a gift she still needs diapers, baby equipment, etc."<br>  <br>  Another thing we did was have people bring a dish, it helped with the food and gave some variety. <br>  <br>  I'm not good with games, but one thing that did help me was that everyone who came filled out an envelope with their address on it. A few times during the shower they had drawings from the basket and whomever's envelope was drawn received a small prize. But the cool thing was when I got home I knew of everyone that had come and had their address already on the envelopes. All I had to do was write the thankyou, put on a stamp and voila! Was done with that job.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Invite.....<br>  <br>  The race is on, baby boy _____ is almost here!<br>  Please join us as we HUGgies & Pamper  Mommy and Daddy ____.<br>  <br>  Other then that I know absolutely nothing about Nascar, so I cannot help. (If you prefer Huggies or pampers just write that)
3qI1oyFaaa	Nope. Taking a while to start showing just means you had stronger abdominal muscles, along with your uterus becoming resistant to stretching. It has nothing to do with how quickly you'll slim back down after delivery. The weight of your baby, method of delivery, whether or not you breastfeed, and post-partum diet and exercise will all determine that.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	It really depends how big you get, how you deliver, if you nurse or formula feed, your lifestyle, and diet.  When you show is not a good indicator of how quickly you'll lose the pregnancy weight.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Oh how I wish that was true.  I didnt show with my third child until about 6 months and I am still trying to lose the weight - 19 months later.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	it depends on the girls body lol.. my friend wa super thing SUPER thin and she didnt show until 7 months and she still needs to lose some more baby weight. her body is completely different|`|Eqln1jmNaa	nope not at all... it just all depends on your own body, and what kind of excersise you you do after the baby is born...|`|G7OwyyHPaa	i sure hope so.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	No, but that's actually how it worked out for me.  I didn't show much until I was about 24 weeks.....and even then it was small.  I gained 50 pounds and with in 2.5 months of having my son, I lost 60 pounds.  But I don't think that had anything to do with showing.|`|wnRMLd2Naa	IDk the actual answer but for my sister she showed really fast an went away really slowly.....im pregnant.......hope i show slowly an loose fast. <br>  Hope i helped:)|`|r6IRYVRnaa	I was a size zero when i started now i am a size 5,7!!

Y8ZmuWwgaa	Amy. <br>  <br>  I actually rather like Amy, despite her being dated to the '70s and '80s. Amy's an exception, as I don't particularly care for Jennifer, Tiffany, Jessica, and others along that vein. Tracey happens to fall into this category for me. It's all right but I prefer it on a boy; for a girl, I'd like it better if it were short for Teresa. The name in general just sound hopelessly dated to me. <br>  <br>  I like Amy better because I love the meaning (friend or beloved one) and it has a prettier sound. The name also looks more visually appealing to me. It also sounds much more substantial because it has literary connections -- the most notable of which is Amy March of "Little Women".|`|TZWkf59Daa	Amy<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=27">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  please answer!<br>  we are looking for best answer!|`|sidLV3Zkaa	Amy.

wZAeBisbaa	Yes that is possible.  But to me "extreme" punishment would constitute abuse.  In fact, I don't believe in punishment at all, because it does encourage revenge.  I believe in discipline, which is different. Discipline means correcting children's behavior, not simply making them suffer with the intent of controlling them or deterring them from misbehaving again.  The latter is punishment. <br>  <br>  I remember a father in the neighborhood where I grew up who punished his kids severely and verbally abused them. One day his teenage son attacked him with a knife.  No one was hurt, and nothing more happened, but that man never went after his sons again.  Had he used a more positive form of discipline, I doubt that they would have turned against him like that.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I think there's more to the 6-month grounding story than is being told.|`|27jdKozNaa	When I was younger my dad was an abusive alcoholic & I would literally get grounded for months on end for the stupidest things.

Good for the child on killing his father.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Yup, people should not discipline their children.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	punishment, mixed with love= good kids<br>  <br>  punishment done to the extreme + love of seeing your child in trouble= seething resentment & future revenge.<br>  i beleive that child in arizona was mistreated, aside from the simple common sense of teaching your child about guns, and regardless of doing this now...... he would have done much worse later on. <br>  <br>  a normal child would not think of shooting their parents, and actually doing it. they might get mad, mabey say hateful things, but not vision their parents dying and following through. <br>  <br>  if my teenager was caught doing something that involved being illegal, hurting someone, doing something that would harm himself.......6 months grounding, is not all that bad. they go to school everyday, and most teenagers have phones, computers etc. im not saying i would automatically go for 6 months, it all depends on the offense.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I think those are extreme cases. (and I'm not sure I believe the 6 month grounding thing)  <br>  <br>  More than likely if anything I think the children will grow up to resent their parents and have poor relationships with them as adults.  Sad, but true.  I think that grounding a kid for months is nothing compared to repeatedly spanking over your own anger issues.  (not that everyone who spanks has anger issues......but if you're spanking your kid over 1,000 times what can I say?)|`|PuQyYMM8aa	There is a huge difference between spankings and child abuse. I do believe in spankings, but i have spanked on rare occasions. When needed and when it is deserved. My 14yr old has maybe been spanked 4 times in his life. He knows what line he can't cross with me. And he knows he gets away with nothing! At this point, all i have to do is give him ( the look ) and he knows he better stop whatever he is doing.|`|dy9C5kYkaa	yes, its true that by extreme punishment a child may take revenge one day. punishment will be like punishment and it should given at extreme cases.|`|PJBjllsVaa	well when it comes to extreme punishment yes i think it can cause serious problems but hopefully most parents DON'T resort to that kind of punishment|`|3cB1fFtsaa	Yes it can. Something to think about before your child ends up beating you up or worse when he is big. Or when you are old how your child will treat you.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Yep, that's why my parents don't punish me extremely.<br>  <br>  They know I'd resent them even more than I already do, and they know I can be a very angry person.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	There's punishment and then there's abuse.  Six months or 1000 spankings is way extreme.|`|8MmmvRlVaa	my mom gives extreme punishments! :(<br>  <br>  see for yourself:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsJUtR9P1AwgPXcNJF5kcaF87hR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223142355AA64xuY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
AA10280194	I am the same way.  I am 12 weeks today and I think the baby should be half grown by now :-)  I was just telling my husband that the baby is NEVER out of my mind.  It is always there in my thought, just tucked off to left a little but no matter what my focus of attention is, the baby is there too.  But, at the same time, the whole concept of having a real live baby growing in me is very abstract and kind of unreal because I can't feel anything and nothing much seem different.  Everybody keeps saying "they'll grow up so fast" so everyday I have to tell myself not to rush things and just enjoy everyday.  It's getting easier now because the 'newness' of it all is wearing off and now my focus is more on 'when will I start showing'.  If you are allowed to take a video camera to your first ultrasound visit then that will give you something real to look at while you wait. :-)|`|VpDhPP8baa	The first few weeks do seem to go on forever and quite often you cannot see the immense changes your body is going through. As the days progress you will have more scans, tests, appointments etc...These will fill up your days.  Make the most of doing things for yourself just now, things that you are still physically able to do, because as you get further through the preg you will get much bigger and more tired.  <br>  Suggestions for now- <br>  1, start/ continue with getting fit- it'll make things easier in the long term- trust me.<br>  2, check out the available maternity and baby stores so you are well informed on what is available<br>  3, consider some travel, as you will be less likely to go for a while ;-)<br>  4, Most importantly enjoy the time, excitements and why not log your feeling as you can look back on them in the future- it is amazing how afterwards a lot of the pregnancy can seem just like a blur.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy|`|oem5yEUDaa	Just take time to enjoy your pregnancy. Buy pregnancy magazines and read about what is happening to your body and your baby, because it is truly amazing. There are also some great pregnancy websites too.Take a LOT of time out for yourself, because you wont have much once baby is here. Just be patient your baby will be here before you know it! It goes so fast.<br>  <br>  And no you do not have 9 months to go, you have 8. Pregnancy is not 10 months like some people will try to tell you. 40 weeks does not equal 10 months, as each month is a bit longer than 4 weeks.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	Only 4 weeks along? Wow so you've just found out your pregnant liturally ayh?<br>  Hmm....get a hobby or work for as long as you can I suggest, or you will drive youself crazy.<br>  I'm 26 weeks and I'm just starting to feel like it's taking forever now lol.<br>  It didn't really hit me until I started buying clothes and other baby necesities a couple of weeks ago.<br>  P.S don't try to get too excited and stuff yet until your 12 weeks along incase you have a miscarrage like I did last year. It sucks.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Don't concentrate on it so hard. I know it sounds crazy/difficult/impossible but you don't wan to be one of those crazy psycho moms either just keep up with your reading its okay to be excited but don't over do it or over analyze things....make plans for yourself set dates to look forward too keep in mind that whatever your plans are they are ok for baby too...trust me it will go by fast at first it seems like forever than it speeds up and then by the time you get to the 29th week it drags from there on out and you can't wait for the little one to come out. <br>  <br>  Personally i used this site to help make the time move a little faster. i used to come on and just read the answers to help better understand what woman go through (most helpful thing i learned on here was that everyone is different and every pregnancy is different so just because someone disagrees with you does not make them wrong unless its a known fact and they don't have there sources correct). now that i am 35 weeks i can answer most questions  and it helps me make the day pass quickly|`|Xf9QGTBraa	Pregnancy is always an exciting time if it's right.<br>  and it seems to me that you will be an excellent mother!<br>  on the other hand, waiting and worrying causes stress which MIGHT influence the baby's development.<br>  Right now it seems like "oh such a long way away" but when it's four weeks TO GO, it'll be a panic.<br>  As for now, relax, stay healthy, plan a little at a time, and make sure to incorporate as many happy times as possible because when you're in a good mood, so will your baby.<br>  <br>  Congrats, good luck.|`|cswHfmFdaa	shopping !|`|r6IRYVRnaa	i felt the same way!! no one around me made it any easier either! THey would drink n smoke around me! So i started a count down. I started doing things for myself. If ever on doubt go to a baby store n check things out! I will tell you it is all worth it! Even now i cant do anything anymore, but i would not give her upi for anything!! I two found out early that i was pregnant, and i now have a 5 month old baby girl!! Trust me you will c people around doing things that you want to do, but just remember you are pregnant, n that baby is all that matters!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I registered on websites like BabyGaga.com that tells you every week what you're going thru AND what's developing with the baby.  It's like MySpace for preggers.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you're 4 weeks pregnant...you technically have 9 months to go :-(  You're actually pregnant for 40 weeks...so you have 36 weeks or 9 months to go.  Register on that site...it makes every week exciting.|`|UNV987Zoaa	first off congrats!!! u prob dont kno if its a girl or boy yet or any names but thats always fun to think about!!<br>  dont wry ur just gettting used to the idea that ur going to be a mommy!!! <br>  the baby will come faster then u kno it and it will be a ton of work but it deff. has its rewards :] <br>  try decorating the babies room or picking out baby names and toys and clothes<br>  go to some parenting classes since its ur 1st baby <br>  u can go hang out with friends (DONT DRINK) but ik u wont :]<br>  if ur friends hav babies go over to there house and play w. there kids<br>  Hope this helps and again congrats!!
lN0GkKgaaa	If they intentionally killed my child I would never be able to forgive them. <br>  <br>  <br>  If it was a complete accident I would forgive that person but it would take a long time for me to do so.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	No|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Depends on what my child was doing at the time.<br>  <br>  If my child was holding up a liquor store and the owner blew away my child with a shotgun, then I'd apologize to the store owner for being a crappy parent and raising a stupid kid.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Intentionally?  Not a chance.  But don't look down on the people who said they could.  They are just not emotionally at the same point you are.  They probably really do believe that if someone killed their child, they could forgive them.  Me, having children and looking in their beautiful blue eyes every day - there is no way I could ever forgive someone if they purposely took them away from me.<br>  <br>  I assume this was a high school class, right?  I think that until you know the love of your own child, it's really hard to answer truthfully to something like this.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I am a big one for forgiveness but I don't think I could forgive someone who killed my child or a loved one.  I think that in order to forgive someone you have to be able to let go of the grudge or anger you are carrying, I would never be able to let go of the anger I feel towards someone who intentionally hurt or killed my children.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  I agree with the person who said there would be nobody left to forgive.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	There would be no one left to forgive if someone killed my child, I'd see to that.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I have not had a child killed but my first husband was murdered when we were only 22. It was a drive by and even tho he was not the target he got hit anyways. <br>   They caught the people, 3  guys. A year latter when the whole thing went to trial I received a letter from one of the guys asking for forgiveness. I took the letter to court and threw it in his face and spit at him. I will never forgive him ever.<br>   People have told me if I do not forgive I will be torn up inside, well I am not and nearly 11 years latter I am ok , I am not torn up about not forgiving the killers.<br>   So if someone killed my child, no I would not forgive them. Some people do not deserve forgiveness.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i would probably forgive them because i beleive in forgiveness, and it would finally eat away at my heart if i didn't.<br>  but that doesn't mean i won't hate them and wish eternal misery on them for the rest of their lives. <br>  i wouldn't forgive them right away either, mabey about 5 min. before they execute him/her or something. i would drag it out, and give myself the right amount of time that i needed.|`|42tTsVuxaa	Thank God I have never been in that situation. If I was, I honestly dont know.. I hope that sometime i could, maybe it would take a long time but I have always been taught to forgive and forget. the first part is no way as hard as the second. <br>  <br>  All I can say is I hope so. Cannot give you a yes or no!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  RR|`|wi6mkT30aa	Because God says to forgiveness is needed and also it does help heal the pain. I would try my best, even though it's almost impossible right now to think about that, because first before I forgave them...If i got a hold of them I'd probably knock them out myself. Just my reaction!|`|PJBjllsVaa	no. i would kill the SOB myself|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no way...id gladly do time for them.

You're only 16, and trust me a lot can happen from now to a couple years....i'm not belittleing your relationship, but lets be realistic here.  If you guys are still together when you're 18 then maybe that would be something to think about.  Take it from a 23 year old who had to move back home with mom and dad, theres nothing like not paying bills or worrying about anything really when you're 16 and you get to worry about HIGH SCHOOL and going out with your friends and thats it.  SO FUN!  Also, I always take my own advice and NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.  You feel that way for a reason.  Don't just give into her because thats what she wants.  You know its a bad decision otherwise you wouldn't be on here asking us.

He is definatley the selfish one.
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	LOL,statistics aren't everything. You aren't putting into account that some people just give up and don't try to work at their relationship. Statistics doesn't guarantee anything. It's what you yourself choose to do when put in the situation. <br>  <br>  Another known factor is that foreign women are more submissive than American women.

Therefore they don't talk or have hardly any type of confrontation...Even if he walks over her and treats her like dirt.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	How about because foreign women are taught to kiss A** or get beat down? Yeah, I said it. Maybe if so many other countries taught their women to be ASSERTIVE and independent, the divorce rate would be higher for them as well.

WWcaKZ7Qaa	Old Navy, Target, and my friends' closets! :]|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I am 14 weeks, almost 15 weeks along and have been wearing pregnancy jeans for the past couple weeks. I bought three pair from JCPenny when they were having a sale a week or so ago. They are the Duo brand which I seem to feel most comfortable wearing. They like what I would typically wear so that works for me. I also bought a shirt from them, but it doesn't look like a pregnancy shirt to me. I've worn it a few times but its really thin. <br>  <br>  I shopped at Kohl's but couldn't find anything really stylish. I like Motherhood a lot too (haven't quite bought anything there) and am waiting to buy some summer clothes from there as the weather gets warmer. I'm trying to wait as long as I can to buy shirts since I know I'll need some more summerish clothes than winter clothes. Old Navy online has some cute stylish maternity clothes too. <br>  <br>  This is my first pregnancy too. :)|`|MtC3CWZraa	Consignment stores. I have to buy pants new because apparently tall women never consign theirs, but just about all of my tops were purchased second hand. Sometimes the stuff still has tags on it. <br>  <br>  You can use maps.google.com to find maternity consignment stores in your area.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	target<br>  kmart (sales are on now) <br>  i had to put on my maternity pants on today i am 28 weeks i hate the pants get one one with the band across not the kangaroo pitchh so to speak they are not comfy|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Motherhood Maternity has a great selection, but it can be kind of pricey.  They do have great sales though!<br>  <br>  I also love Target and Ross!<br>  <br>  Have fun and congrats!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I'm not buying maternity tops at all. I have taken to buying xl tee's and tanks from wet seal (5 for $20) and casual dresses. Most shirts now a days are long anyway so i figure if i buy lose fitting dresses or dresses that are stretchy and tee's i can wear them again after i have my baby. That way the only clothes i won't be wearing post-baby are my pants (and i only bought like 3 pairs). Why waist money? lol Maternity clothes are pricey and ugly anyway.|`|PfIywLLyaa	A Pea in the Pod - except very overpriced. They have the best looking clothes in my opinion but they can break the bank. Old Navy and Gap also have great clothes. I definitely preferred shopping online - a lot more selection!

Although you want to look and feel attractive, you are not going to want to spend a huge amount of money for them (you will only wear them a few months).  Target has a Liz Lange Maternity line that is reasonable in price, and easy on style.  Target also almost always have clearance racks, which means you can get them for an even cheaper price!<br>  <br>  Motherhood maternity and Old navy is also a couple of stores I've purchased items from, but I still prefer Target.|`|wycisonaaa	Here are my suggestions; <br>  <br>  <br>  Target  * <a href="http://www.target.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com</a> * women's >> maternity.<br>  <br>  JCPenney *  <a href="http://www.jcpenney.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcpenney.com</a> * women's >> maternity<br>  <br>  Gap * <a href="http://www.gap.com/browse/division.do?cid=5997" rel="nofollow">http://www.gap.com/browse/division.do?ci...</a> *<br>  <br>  Pea in the Pod *  <a href="http://www.apeainthepod.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.apeainthepod.com</a> *<br>  <br>  Old Navy: * <a href="http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/division.do?cid=5758" rel="nofollow">http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/division.d...</a> *<br>  <br>  Target's my favorite because the pricing is reasonable and the selection is wonderful. :]<br>  <br>  One more I know of is Bella Blue Maternity * <a href="http://www.bellablumaternity.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellablumaternity.com</a> * kind of expensive, but a good indulgence.|`|B11nrKmdaa	There are so many places!

hl5WdXnbaa	I agree it is sad, kids need a mom and Dad. BUt kids rather be from a broken home then in one.  My parents stayed together for the sake of us kids, but they always fought. I would be crying in my bed at night listening to the yelling and screaming. We never did anything as a family, such as vacations or even going out to the movies because MOm and Dad would fight. You could cut the stress in my home with a knife. People back in those days did not divorce as much, it was still considered  a big no no. So when I was 14 and my parents split up, we kids were very thankful. Things were so much happier in the home for us kids .<br>   So I rather have kids come from a happy home , even if that means a single parent home.  I am sure you can find a million other people with stories like mine. Just because you have Mom and Dad, live in a house in the suburbs with a mini van and a dog does not mean you are not in a "broken" home.|`|G2auAv1Saa	It is really sad and the statistics are shocking really. <br>  I thank my parents all the time for raising me in a great home. It was a goal my husband and I had when we got married to raise our children in the same type of environment. <br>  I am glad you have a relationship with your father now and are able to devote yourself to your husband and children.<br>  <br>  edit: Much as I would love to single-handidly change this, I don't think it will decrease in our society. As long as single motherhood is encouraged and promoted (like a badge of honor I have heard people say) it will not change. And as long as people keeping casual sexual encounters without thinking of consequences it will continue.|`|wZAeBisbaa	We no longer use the term "broken" homes to describe single parent households. It's prejudiced.   Having only one parent, or even losing one from the household because of divorce does not in itself "break" a family.  If the kids  have problems, it's often because of the circumstances surrounding the family - such as low income or poverty, lack of parental involvement, bitter parental conflict or hostility, drug or alchol addiction, or abuse.  These things can and do "break" homes. They also cause children to grow up very messed up.  <br>  <br>  But remember that many children grow up with only one parent or with two parents who do not live together, and they are not broken and do not need to be fixed. It's great that you and your husband will never divorce. It's great that you love your kids enough to work together for their sake.  But these things do not necessarily make you better parents.  Divorced and never married parents can also provide happy homes and can be just as committed to their children.|`|PJBjllsVaa	i agree it is very sad. but no i don't think things will ever change probably just get worse. my parents divorced when i was 3 and i am not going to get into the details but now that i am older, married and have my own children i work EXTRA hard to make my marriage and home happy and healthy not just for my children but for my husband and myself. i wish i could say that all kids who come from a broken home could change the world because they want things to be better then what they had but i think sometimes kids from a broken home are just so lost that they don't know how to get on the right track or they don't feel they have a reason or a choice. it is real sad.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Oh, gosh, I swore off questions like this because of my own personal hatred of the family law system, but I will tell you that broken homes are the norm, and why should it not be so?<br>  This system is the only one that I know of that allows parents to walk away from their so-called mistakes while never actually having to admit that they made one, slander the other parent, alienate their child from the other parent, and still walk away with a hefty cash settlement (subject to yearly increases to boot)?<br>  Family law makes it so easy to perpetuate broken homes.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Another yahoo editorial?  What is your question?  <br>  <br>  The rate of divorce is sky-rocketing so of course more children are coming from "broken" homes.  Though, who is to say what "broken" means?  It's been proven that children do better with one single, stable parent than they do with two unstable parents.<br>  <br>  So, yes.  More children are growing up in single-parent homes, but I don't think that makes it a broken home.  I think we all just do what we think is best and hope our children are okay with our decisions.|`|1ERDjrTTaa	I truly hate the term "Broken home" who is to say that it is broken just because the parent are no longer together. Maybe the home was "broken in the first place and that's why the parents are no longer together. I am divorced from my the father of my kids, but their home is not broken. Our home is a safe, happy, secure home where my kids know they are loved. The word broken means that something needs to be fixed and nothing needs to be fixed in my home, except maybe a leaking faucet.|`|teDI6RQ8aa	In this case your mom refused to do what was right and stand up to her parents.  <br>  <br>  As for my parents, my mother's parents, the only marriage her parents approved of was the only one to wind up in divorce.  Their two younger kids have been married 40 + years.  Reason being is the first one was a Pharmacist, and the wife an assistant or something like that, so they were going places.  The second one, the husband, didn't have a good job at the time, but ultimately became mayor of his town.  My mom would be moving to the US to raise a family with my dad.

So let it go through your system now and hope it's over by the time of your Dr. visit.

However, this does not mean that you are not pregnant. If your period ended 2/6, on a 28 day cycle (which you may not be) you should not start AF yet. So HPT would not detect HCG levels yet. If you do not get AF in another week, then do a HPT and see what the results are. If negative, call your DR and see about the paragard IUD. I had this inserted in 11/08 and it is soooo much better than the mirena!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Phd9irMmaa	nop not yet<br>  but do u have a baby bump if so then u are<br>  and take the test another 3 times spread into 3 weeks just to be sure|`|tcHkn0VIaa	You could be pregnant but it is too early to tell by HPT.

My mum had those symptoms, and it turned out to be a reaction to her new medicine.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope everything turns out for the best.

The priest convinced her that, being Catholic, she should name her daughter after a saint.  They figured out that she had an aunt named Alice, which is a saints name.  He just didn't have the heart to tell the girl what gonorrhea is!|`|9TE9lOKBaa	it sounds like clitoris, or some other part of the vagina.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No..|`|yNxYYHszaa	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SnQvsOPwaa	You have no idea what your talking about. A knee jerk reaction to emotional feed back. Do the research on physical punishment before you go spouting off any more. A good place to start by the way is the behavioral research that's been coming out of england for the last 20 years. It will clear up a lot of things for you.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well one can only HOPE that you are not a parent of a teenager in this generation.  Certainly this generation of teens IS different in many ways and in many NOT SO great ways too. BUT they are up against a world that is also different than the one most of us were raised in as well and they REQUIRE a new angle of parenting skill & love & patience to help them effectively and successfully weather this world they live in.  <br>  <br>  As a parent of 4 I can tell you my opinion that hitting a child usually only makes a PARENT feel better for a brief moment of anger or rage or frustration and SELDOM is a useful, helpful or productive way to discipline a child.  You think hitting a child or worse a TEENAGER is acceptable and then you turn around and tell them to NOT be violent in this society?  Come on - what planet are you living on.  <br>  <br>  Parenting is about raising and teaching our children to be responsible, capable, honest, worthwhile members of their communities and world. Helping them learn about choices, accountability and consequencs of choices.  Teaching them that being a positive, productive person requires self control, self confidence and self reliance.  I hope to add loving themselves requires them to love their neighbor as themselves as well - as CHRIST would do.    Children who are raised in a loving, valued, learning-rich home, where they are cared for, accountable, learn a strong work ethic will weather the storms of their teenage years and become the people we hope they can become and go into a world that needs what they have to offer.<br>  <br>  I'll be the lst to admit that I've swatted my kids butts on a few occasions when they were little.  I even slapped my daughter in the face once when she mouthed off - but I am not happy I did that.  It takes some creative parenting to provide PROPER consequences that actually make a difference in the lives of our children.  Any fool that lacks control over their anger can slap or hit a child - that requires NO parenting ability, skill or effort whatsoever!<br>  <br>  I can only HOPE that this ISN'T a serious posting.....|`|4eTyCuRSaa	Punishment for misbehavior needs to be administered in the manner that will accomplish it's purpose.  To hit someone just to hit them because they did something wrong is repulsive.  Punishment needs to fit the crime.  <br>  <br>  I am a believer in spanking but not for everything.  It is the punishment of last resort or for major infractions of the rules.<br>  <br>  Sometimes other types of punishments can be much more effective than resorting to a smack across the face.<br>  <br>  As a parent it is not your job just to dole out punishment but also to try to train and teach your child through that punishment what they should have done.<br>  <br>  Also spankings, hitting or other kinds of physical punishment only work up to certain ages,  After that it just breeds resentment along with bad behavior.|`|U1chPjvPaa	I tend to  agree with some of your statements.  I was spanked once or twice.  And I'm pretty much perfect. jk  <br>  I was more perfect before I started drinking......|`|5SEogmv6aa	I agree with u, spanking shouold always be first. mabe if the behavior gets worse, the spanking get harder and the child gets more.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I think certain behaviors warrant a little smack. I wouldn't say at least a spanking b/c not every situation calls for that. I do think to many parents want to be too friendly instead of assertive with their child because they want them to be babies forever, but really just contradict themselves. "Jamie please let mommy dress you to day" or "Can i comb your hair" Give me a break you don't have to ask a 2 year old to do things that have to be done, its crazy just do it. It kills me that some parents want to ask their child's permission for everything they do, but at the same time when you mention disciplining them they want to scream they are just babies. Ok so your gonna beg a 10 month old to eat his veggies but he's too little to understand what the word no means? come on get a grip.<br>  The majority of kids i saw cursing out their parents and acting up were ones who never got spankings (my mom would have slapped me silly if i ever thought to curse at her and i would have deserved it)|`|kIad9ffRaa	Depending on the age,sex, and temperament of the child, I would say that a child from 1and a half till about 6 or 7 should be spanked but not a lot at once. When they get to the 7-14 age group, a long hand spanking or a mild hairbrushing or paddling would be called for. Adolescents are tricky though. Some are too mature for it and others aren't. Some girls need a hard hand until they are 18. Every child is different.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	I was spanked and smacked around when I was littler, and guess what? I'm still bitchy, disrespectful, and ignorant.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's just my personality. <br>  <br>  And as for hip hop not teaching good values? If a kid can't tell what's right from wrong by themselves, they're stupid. It didn't take my parents to tell me whores and pimps were bad, I watched MSNBC.|`|HEmJ4auCaa	when i was little my parents used to hit me and i dont think i teaches kids anything i mean i would get hit and then i could go outside and keep on playing or whatever i think that they should get punished like take something they really like away like t.v , electronic games, junk food ect.|`|w56allkqaa	true You Have A Point But That's Because Most Of These Parents Aren't Trying To Be Parent There Trying To Be Friends With There Child. && That's Why They Choose Not To Hit There Kids.

After all tests usually have no risks, if something is wrong and you think the treatment is unsafe you can always say no.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are healthy add some lean protein to your diet, and probably an extra serving or two of whole grains.  You probably need to add 300-500 calories to your diet to see noticeable weight gain.<br>  <br>  Keep snacks around all the time.  Hard boiled eggs, nuts, and granola can be good.  Dried fruit is good, particularly to toss in your purse/diaper bag.<br>  <br>  However both my mom and grandma went through this, and nothing worked.

You can try moving to full-fat dairy products, and eating proteins like peanut butter, avocado, some fish, and of course meats.  Healthy protiens and fats of course are best (things with omega-3s or unsaturated fat), and will give you nutritional benefits as well as additional calories.|`|LGidAYDwaa	I had the same problem.

It sounds like a horrible thing, but it's not something that's going to have a huge impact on her overall health. It may just need to be drained down the line due to its size. <br>  <br>  Just like your son and the kidney, babies are born with such problems more often than we realize because it's not that typical to do a scan so late in the pregnancy. She could just as easily been born without anyone knowing it was there. <br>  <br>  Even though it's not a huge deal, I have had four subsequent ultrasounds (for a total of seven) to keep an eye on it and six, going on seven non-stress tests as a precaution. <br>  <br>  I didn't really worry about it when it was found and it doesn't worry me now.

Its unique, nice and feminant. <br>  Maybe another way to spell to avoid confusion is, Sahmia. <br>  Good luck! :)|`|yYOh0DUjaa	It's not my cup of tea but it's a lot better then some of the other names on here. If you like it then go for it :]|`|TU2LlkcUaa	i dont like it tbh|`|LE58Pj37aa	It reminds me of the little girl in the RIng, a horror film!  How about Samara or samantha!|`|5W8BRSRCaa	my name is samia,<br>  i like that name and i get a lot of compliments, i think you should go for it;););););)(;(;(;(;(;|`|8ldMwflKaa	That's a very pretty name!<br>  It's very unique.
aY5vHbPLaa	Bryan Christopher Coleman II<br>  Make Daddy proud,,,<br>  It's actually a nice name<br>  Or  lol you can shake up things a little and name him Christopher Bryan Coleman, make him his own little man.|`|prllht3vaa	I don't think that making a Jr. is creative. I think sometimes they will think that they cant be their own person. And that they cant do what they want to do, and they have to follow their fathers footsteps. So i defiantly like the name Nolan Christopher Coleman a lot better. Its a cute name, and it is close to the fathers name, so both can win :)|`|qRDHEGHJaa	If you dont want your baby to be a jr, i dont like that either so i understand. i would say go with nolan and just tell your fiance you didnt name your daughter all the way after you....good luck|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I like Nolan better, personally. I also like Noah Christopher.|`|c8URWkq1aa	um i think jr is a bit old fashioned <br>  but <br>  i am not to keen on nolan<br>  how about<br>  Benjimen<br>  Dylan<br>  or Jamie|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I like Nolan Better, but I do like the idea of naming him after his dad.|`|wfbf44rUaa	i do like Nolan Christopher Coleman Better<br>  <br>  hope that helps <br>  god bless|`|3BfmNEdPaa	yes|`|sidLV3Zkaa	I like Nolan Christopher Coleman much better because it lets your husband have a mark on the name, but gives your son a chance for a seperate identity.  I would have absolutely hated to be name my mother's name with Jr. behind it.  I think it is safe to assume almost every person would like to have a name that is just theirs, especially when you have to live in the house with a person sharing your name that would get pretty confusing unless your son just sticks with being called jr.  That is a big possibility ......so I would make sure you can like your son being called just jr. if he is named Bryan Christopher Coleman.  The mean I know named exactly after dad are called just junior or J. R.|`|vdVVZiY6aa	-I Think Bryan Christopher Coleman Jr. is a great name=]<br>  <br>  -It has FamiLy Meaning<br>  <br>  -I ThinK Nolan and Coleman Rhyme too Much<br>  <br>  -If you really don't like your fiance's name, compromise with    him and maybe just suggest either his first or middle name as Nolan's middle name<br>  <br>  -If you think it would be too confusing, you could call your son Christopher or Chris<br>  <br>  Hope This HeLps!|`|8ldMwflKaa	i definitely like the name Nolan better! It's very cute. Bryan is too common. Nolan is one of those names that you barely ever hear, but is still better than a common name.|`|o3y5NlPkaa	Christopher Colman|`|5Bp769DSaa	nolan christopher coleman much better :)|`|MW1yrHbOaa	nolan christopher coleman|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I like Nolan Christopher much better, because it is a nice name and I really don't care for Jr.s.  Using your fiance's name for the middle name is nice.|`|brVS3Pg0aa	i would go with bryan christopher coleman if that and the other one are they only choices, but i really like these names better, and they are similiar to the ones u gave:<br>  <br>  Christian Nolan<br>  Christopher Nolan<br>  Brian Nolan<br>  <br>  nolan christopher, and bryan christopher dont really flow, but i guess bryan christopher is the best outta the two. Good Luck!|`|sAbah6dTaa	i wouldn't do a jr just because it doesn't make him is own person.<br>  <br>  and i really don't care for nolan either, but christopher coleman is cute.|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	Yes. I like the idea of family names as middle names, but it's a bit unoriginal (and egotistical!) to name your child after yourself. Potentially confusing too!|`|r5UfVeYbaa	nolan is soo much better

5jqfKDdfaa	Just tell her thats what you want to do....Tell her that you dont want to go to college and do what SHE wants. Its your life. You dont have to live up to your parents expectations if you dont want to--even as an eigth grader.  When youre 18, youll end up making decisions that she cant force you to change anyway....so tell her that if shes gonna make you go to regular schol until you graduate, then youll just practice on art until then and then go to art school after.  Financial aid covers vocational schooling so you wont need her support....<br>  <br>  The reason she just laughs your dreams off is bc she prolly doesnt think you know what youre talking abt (8th grade....youre 13-14 years old rite?).  So make sure that this is what you really wanna do before you go confronting your mom.|`|Y2k81CWWaa	Tell her what you just told us. Tell her what you want, and when she laughs at you it hurts. Maybe you should show her this. Your future is for YOU, to do what YOU want, not her. So make sure to tell her that.|`|3BfmNEdPaa	Well i'm kind of in that same spot. If you have divorced parents and one lives in the city and you know that your safe with them then you can get a judge to allow custody over you when you are 14. That's what's going on with me. But if not, get some money look up schools you like and apply. Make sure that if you come face to face with her to show her your art. Help her understand your dream of artistic designs.
98WKYtfwaa	I agree, i mean i'm 18 and pregnant. My parents taught me everything about sex, pregnancy stis and everything. I still went on to have sex, it's a natural feeling to want to have sex, and very little people don't do it.|`|wdvPCU7Taa	I'm sure many teens ahve made it to college still being a virgin. You say things as if there's no hope for teens not to have sex. I know there's pressure, but it's still that teens choice. It's not like it's impossible for them to resist. If they make that choice, it's there's and no ones to blame but them.|`|5d69096a97f9015e41817b901338a7cbaa	I wasn't there myself. I waited until I got married so I wouldn't have all those issues.  And being married without wanting kids we use birth control pills and a condom every time.  So yeah. no fear of pregnancy, no worries of STDS and no worries about being compared to other lovers.  It was worth waiting for me and my wife.|`|FRpkuABlaa	I'm glad somebody has said it.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	My wife was a virgin when I married her. I couldn't imagine marrying someone who wasn't. I don't agree that most women don't have sex before marriage. At least we don't have that many ****$ here in Canada.|`|9ewRarFuaa	i am a teen and i really agree with you, maybe our parents should pay more attention instead of just telling us not to have sex. most of the time, teens are not gonna listen.|`|lcjMqzh9aa	coz not all of us have been there ourselves|`|PJBjllsVaa	i don't disagree but i don't agree either. when i was a teen i didn't listen to my mother... i didn't wait until i got married HOWEVER i did wait until i found a guy that was special to me, i had only been with him along time (well for a 16 year old 1 year is a long time) and i was SAFE not only was I on BC but we used condoms too. if i had still gotten pregnant i understood what the consequences would be. most kids these days are going out and having sex with MULTIPLE partners and NOT being safe... mostly because they don't even understand what sex is. i cant tell you how many times i have read on here 'we had dry sex can i be pregnant' or 'he had sperm on his hand an fingered me could i be pregnant' i mean give me a break if these kids have to ask these questions they SHOULD NOT be having sex! not to mention 12-13-14 year olds SHOULD NOT Be having sex period. what do they even know about it other then 'hey lets put my thing in your thing and see what happens' i mean really. atleast when i did it i was EDUCATED and i think that's what the biggest problem on here is well that and the fact that you have 14-15-16 year olds on here saying i had sex with x amount of people now im pregnant, don't know who the father is and i want an abortion. it's just not right. and you are right parents can't control every move their teen makes however like my mother did these other parents should make sure that their children have the EDUCATION about sex so that these kids can make informed decisions. and most of the time it's just not the case.|`|Y3Y45d4oaa	Well, i lost my virginity at 15, and got pregnant the very first time i ever had sex. I wish most people including my parents thought the way you do about this topic. I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks due to my father beating the **** out of me.  Some people do not understand that when your that young, and that gullible you do make mistakes and thinking that the guy loves you is a huge one. However, I am still with that guy and are expecting a baby girl this april 6 yrs later. I know that growing up my parents never talked with us about sex or birth control or really the risks of having sex, yeah we learned it in health class but just like every other 5th grader we thought EW. So i really wish there were more ppl out there with a good outlook on teens having sex. & for the men on here posting that their WIVES were virgins when they married them, well were YOU? I still don't see why girls are considered sluts after having sex but guys are given high fives and congrats.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	Honestly, I can't relate to the girls who are having sex in high school because I didn't. I'm not saying my way is 'better' but when I had started having sex I was in college and to this day I've only had sex with that person. I couldn't imagine having sex at 15-17 because at that age I just wasn't ready. I have never had a pregnancy scare because when I decided to have sex I was old enough to realize how serious the threats of STDs and pregnancy are... If these kids would just wait, they wouldn't have to ask stupid questions on YA.|`|krCAJuZiaa	You cant blame your parents for not being there %100 and even if they were then it would drive you crazy... If your parents dont pay enough attention to you then let them know... you are putting everyone in the same catagory and not ALL or MOST teens have sex.... And just becasue you have sex it doesnt make you a slu T or a bad person... <br>                                                                                                    You just have to realize the consequenses of your actions wether it may be pregnancy or STDS. You ultamitley make the decision to have sex and you have to deal with the aftermath. Some teens don't realize the emotional toll that sex can take on them and that is another thing you have to consider... you mentioned "parents" alot in your question... maybe you are feeling rebelious and bitter towards them for some reason?                                                                                           <br>  Just be sure that you know what you are getting yourself into... If you have sex and something goes wrong... you can only blame yourself a nd no one else... you are smart enough to know wrong from right... its worth the wait... Sex isnt something to be thrown around as if it was nothing.... so good luck and make good choices...|`|sjkASt4Raa	hmm ive only had sex with one person <br>  and i was 15 and a virgin then ive been with that person since i was 14 <br>  and now were married  alot of times teen sex doesnt turn out the<br>  same way in the end out of all these times i never got pregnant <br>  never had a scare and true we werent always safe but nothing ever turned out bad......<br>  and sure i wont go to college as a virgin but most teens do...<br>  but at least i wont be going to college with a baby like you make it sound like every teen does im still a teen myself but married ^-^ no im not 18 im actually 17|`|mr4pB3xFaa	pretty much.<br>  it's getting really big these days too, like the population of teens that have done it.|`|1w6m03RNaa	I like your opinion but I think lots of people don't want to say what there's is|`|kr0u4Esdaa	have sex when ur ready and got a wife|`|s519vyP5aa	its true but when i left my house at 15 i stayed with my man a tried to make a life with him but this didn't turn out we broke up after 4 yrs but there is nothing that the parent's can do but give the best advise .. i understand the hormones go wild .. i just wish them best of luck ....|`|QSodlfMraa	that is life.

dzWLgnLlaa	Why is your doctor not concerned?<br>  <br>  Is your baby in a good mood between vomiting?  Does he play?  Is he responsive and alert?  Is he trying to eat?  Is he sleeping?  If he is then it might not be too serious.<br>  <br>  It could be a thousand things.  If he's nursing only, you, mommy, should try to avoid dairy entirely.  It could be reflux, gas, colic, early teething, food intolerance, food allergy, cyclic vomiting, ear infection, flu.<br>  <br>  Check baby's head for dehydration also.  If the top of his head is depressed much you'll want to talk to your doctor about hydrating baby.  Do NOT do anything on your own without physician's advice, but maybe they'll want you to give baby a dropper (half teaspoon) of pedialyte to keep him hydrated.<br>  <br>  Honestly, though, if you feel this is serious and you doctor isn't answering your questions get a new doctor NOW or go to the Emergency Room.  Better to be safe than sorry.|`|8xGtiGBraa	First, calm down, if it was me, I would go to urgent care, or er. That said, ear infections hurt, real bad, I had one when I was pregnant. The med. may be the reason for the puking. He may be getting dehydrated, try some rice milk, gatorade, even water. One time my son got dehydrated, I had to use a dropper to get liquid down him. I'm praying now for you and your son.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	maybe he's allergic to the antibiotics, ear infections will not cause puking. He may have a sensitive stomach.|`|3255bf9a56942506a066812fff721579aa	You need to take him to the ER immediately.<br>  He's got to be extremely dehydrated by now.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	It sounds like you need to take him to the ER. You need to take him because he could be dehydrated or you won't to prevent dehydration.|`|3fYRi1y4aa	Take him to an ER now.  Time for a new Dr.  My Drs office takes babies no matter what if they are sick.  Doesnt matter how busy they are.|`|AA10938311	I am so sorry to hear that your little man is sick.  I would take him to the Emergency Room.  If he is not keeping anything down he will get dehydrated.  Praying that he gets well soon!|`|f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	1. Calm down<br>  2. How long has the vomiting been happening?  Few hours? Days? This makes a difference.  If this is more a day, stop reading and go to the ER now!<br>  3. Eating is not the problem here, loss of fluids is a HUGE problem.<br>  4. Stop with the milk and switch to pedialyte, ask the pharmacy tech to help you.<br>  5. Keep offering fluids the pedialyte is best. Offer as much as the baby will take.<br>  6. The medicine could be making the baby sick, how long has he been taking it?<br>  7. If your mom is local, call her & have her come and take a look.  <br>  <br>  This could be a virus, could be the medicine.  Don't panic.  Babies get sick and vomit.  Watch for signs of dehydration (pinch the skin on the top of your babies hand, if the skin does not go back to the normal position, he is dehydrated & you have to go to the hospital)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Sounds like he could be getting dehydrated if he's puking hourly. This is the type of thing that warrants a trip to the ER. Dehydration is very serious in babies.<br>  <br>  Also if you doctor can;t get you in for a week it's time for a new doctor.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	He could be allergic to the antibiotics.<br>  <br>  If he is still puking tomorrow take him to a walk-in clinic.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T083300.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T083300...</a><br>  TOP SIX CAUSES OF VOMITING<br>  <br>  1. Stomach flu – by far the most common cause.<br>  <br>  2. Food poisoning – relax, this doesn't really mean "poison", it simply means there were some bad bacteria in the food your child ate.<br>  <br>  3. Other intestinal illnesses – there are a variety of other viral and bacterial intestinal illnesses besides the flu that can cause vomiting. Most are not serious.<br>  <br>  4. Severe cough and cold – children can often vomit after a big coughing fit. This isn't really considered a vomiting problem but rather a coughing problem. Click on Coughs, Colds & Sinus Infections for more info.<br>  <br>  5. Bladder infection – if your child has had a high fever for several days with occasional vomiting, and the urine burns or smells foul, consider this cause.<br>  <br>  6. Intestinal obstruction – now DON'T PANIC. This is by far the least common cause, but it is also the most serious and is considered a surgical emergency. See below.<br>  <br>  HOW TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE<br>  The top four causes are very difficult to distinguish at the onset because they all start out the same – profuse vomiting every 5 to 30 minutes for the first 1 to 12 hours. Understanding the various causes and expected course of these three will help you determine the cause.<br>  <br>  1. Stomach flu – this is a virus that causes sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and stomach pain. Diarrhea usually begins during the first or second day. The length of vomiting varies from the "12 hour flu" to the dreaded "72 hour flu". There is no blood or stool test to diagnose this.<br>  <br>  2. Food poisoning – this is caused by bad bacteria that is present in spoiled food. The onset usually comes 2 to 12 hours after eating the food. Common food sources are: spoiled mayonnaise, chicken, fish, beef, or salad dressing. Some clues that it may be food poisoning are:<br>  <br>      * Often there is no fever<br>      * Usually occurs within a few hours after eating an identifiable source of bad food such as a questionable restaurant or a picnic.<br>      * Vomiting usually does not last more than 12 hours.<br>      * Therefore, if there is a high fever, you can't think of any bad food your child ate, and the vomiting lasts beyond 12 hours, it probably is not food poisoning. Diarrhea may or may not develop. <br>  <br>  3. Other intestinal viruses or bacterial illnesses – there are a variety of these. Some examples include Rotavirus, Salmonella, and E-Coli. The initial vomiting pattern, stomach pain and fever of these illnesses is the same as the stomach flu and therefore difficult to distinguish from the flu. However, in the initial period of vomiting, it is not really necessary to determine which of all these illnesses is causing it. Instead, you simply need to know how to handle the vomiting.<br>  <br>  4. Intestinal obstruction – this occurs when the intestines become twisted and is considered a medical emergency that demands immediate medical attention. The key symptom here is actually SEVERE abdominal pain. If there is only moderate or no pain, it's probably not an obstruction. Here are the symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Sudden onset of abdominal pain<br>      * Persistent dark-green vomiting (bile), not just light-green mucus<br>      * Usually, but not always, projectile<br>      * Agonizing pain that may be constant, but may also come and go<br>      * No bowel movements<br>      * Pale and sweaty skin<br>      * Child is overall worsening rather than staying the same or improving <br>  <br>  GETTING THROUGH THE NIGHT<br>  The first thing to remember is DON'T PANIC. Vomiting is usually not dangerous and only rarely results in significant dehydration. Keep in mind it usually takes at least 12 hours of severe vomiting to make a child significantly dehydrated. These guidelines should help you get your child through the vomiting stage of his illness:<br>  <br>      * First stage – severe vomiting every 5 – 30 minutes.<br>            o During this time, do not attempt to give your child any food or liquids at all because they will just come right back up. This is called total bowel rest. Let the worst of the vomiting pass.<br>            o If your child asks to nurse or drink something, then just offer small sips at a time, and don't expect him to keep it down. <br>      * Second stage – the vomiting has started to slow down to every one or two hours.<br>            o Go ahead and offer your child small sips of liquids every 5 or 10 minutes.<br>            o Here are the three best liquids to try:<br>            o Oral electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte has the best balance of salt, sugar, and other electrolytes<br>            o Frozen popsickle or slushy made from an electrolyte solution<br>            o Breastmilk is excellent for the nursing baby<br>  <br>              A few other suggestions until you can get an electrolyte solution:<br>            o White grape juice or slushy slightly diluted with water.<br>            o Gatorade or similar drink<br>                  + Again, these are not as ideal, and should be replaced with Pedialyte when possible.<br>                  + Liquids NOT to give – apple, pear, and cherry juice may have too much sugar. This can worsen diarrhea and dehydration. <br>      * Third stage – vomiting is now only 2 – 4 times a day or stopped altogether.<br>            o It is now okay to try some foods.<br>                  + Bland foods such as crackers, toast, soup broth, etc.<br>                  + Continue breastfeeding.<br>                  + Restart formula if formula feeding. You can mix half formula and half Pedialyte at first. This may be more easily tolerated.<br>                  + Continue liquids as described above. <br>            o Don't be alarmed if your child throws up this food. It may be too soon to start feeding again. Just take a step back to the second stage until the vomiting calms down again.<br>            o RECTAL ACETAMINOPHEN – if your child has a fever but can't keep down any medicine, we suggest acetaminophen suppositories. Click on it.<br>            o ANTI-NAUSEA MEDICATION – there are suppositories that can be prescribed by your doctor for kids two and older that can suppress the vomiting to get your child through the worst of it. These medications should only be used when absolutely needed. A commonly used brand is Phenergan. <br>  <br>  WHEN NOT TO WORRY<br>  <br>      * Persistent vomiting – if the vomiting seems like it's going on forever, you need to assess your child for dehydration. If he is only mildly or maybe moderately dehydrated, this generally can wait until morning to contact your doctor.<br>      * Dehydration – keep in mind most kids will become mildly dehydrated during a vomiting illness. Mild dehydration is not serious and often does not warrant an urgent call to your doctor. Click on it for more info on how to assess the degree of dehydration and when to call your doctor.<br>      * Vomiting comes back – what commonly happens is a child will get better for a day or two, and then begin vomiting again. This is generally okay. Assess which stage he seems to be in and treat it accordingly.<br>      * Fever – it is normal to have even high fevers for several days. Click on fever for guidelines and treatment.<br>      * Blood in vomitus – you may see bloody streaks in your child's vomitus. Tiny tears in the throat cause this from the pressure of vomiting. It is generally not dangerous and should pass. See below.<br>  <br>  WHEN TO WORRY<br>  Here are some guidelines on when to call your doctor or go to the ER:<br>  <br>      * Persistent vomiting – you should call your doctor if stage one vomiting continues past 8 hours in children under one, 12 hours in children one through three years old, and 16 hours in kids four and older.<br>      * Large amount of blood in vomitus – if the tears in the throat become too large from severe, high pressure vomiting, they can bleed significantly. If you think this is really happening, go to an emergency room promptly. This is very rare though, as the tears generally stay very tiny and only bleed slightly.<br>      * Moderate to severe dehydration – click here for more guidelines, but this generally warrants a call to your doctor.<br>      * Meningitis – a brief word here. Although vomiting is not the main sign of meningitis, it is one of them. If your child has severe headache, stiffness or pain in the BACK of the neck, high fever, and vomiting, call your doctor right away.<br>      * Kidney infection – again, vomiting isn't the main symptom for this, but if your child has high fevers, vomiting, and is complaining of burning with urination or the urine smells foul, you should call your doctor.|`|AA11537580	he may be allergic to the antibiotics<br>  go to the ER|`|87WOSjwgaa	Take your baby into the ER!

5f6XnInEaa	You know, the key to loosing weight is not purely relying on breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  You have to eat right, and do light exercises.<br>  Water aerobics, light walks, jogs with the baby in a pram, are all good.<br>  (If your feeling up to it)<br>  <br>  If you are already doing those, that is fantastic, and there is not much more you can do.<br>  <br>  There is more to life than a pudgy tummy.<br>  It takes 9 months to gain all that weight, so you shouldn't expect it to drop off, just because you are breastfeeding.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Breastfeeding takes around 500 calories form you a day. If you eat more than the 2,000 calorie intake (tey say to do 2,500 while breastfeeding but then you wouldnt lose anything) then no, you won't lose it. Just try to fight your appetite if you know you have eaten enough and are just wanting to snack. Best of luck!|`|3cMRhJHSaa	I just had my 3rd child, I know what you mean about being a lot more hungry while breastfeeding I seemed to lose most of my weight about 8 weeks after having my children and it will being gone at about 6 months everyone is different though. My friend said it took her about a yr to get her flat tummy back I just had my son 4 weeks ago so I am looking for to that again.|`|f0c14af9cf77a6bb68c4ffdbb372cdacaa	One of my friends said nine months to put it on an d nine to take it off again so that's what i'm aiming for, my little one's only two months so i've a while to go, just eat healthily and moderate exercise.... good luck ;o)|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Breastfeeding burns up to 1,200 calories a day(the more milk you make the more calories you burn)! Plus tightens your stomach muscles, your uterus contracts after feedings. I lost all my baby weight breastfeeding my kids, the second baby alot faster than my first one( I gained 53lbs with #1:(). I breastfed both for the first year as recommended by AAP. My first baby I lost all my weight completely after about a 1.5 years. For the most part I ate healthy but I still ate whatever I wanted and as much as I wanted to. I didn't exercise at all, just normal everyday activities. Baby #2 is now 16 months and I am been at 118(my normal weight and bikini ready!) for over 8 months:)<br>  <br>  Also you should eat six meals a day to help speed up your metabolism. Five of your six meals should be small/medium(as long as your breastfeeding eat as much as you would like:)) size, your biggest meal of the day should be in the morning... your body needs the fuel and you have all day to burn it off. Also I read that people who eat eggs for breakfast loose 65% more fat than people who eat bagels, cereal, ect..<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be eating junk... stuff that comes pre packaged. You need lots of fresh veggies and fruit(buy frozen if you can't fo fresh) Eggs, chicken and fish are a great source of protein. Yogurt, cheese, oatmeal are all good little snacks. Don't drink soda it is awful for you and doesn't help when trying to loose weight, stick to water, 100% juice and milk.<br>  <br>  Organic apple cider vinegar helps with weight loss and it is okay for you to drink when your breastfeeding. I suggest not drinking it by its self, I like to add apple juice and don't drink more than 2tbs of that stuff a day or you will be stuck on the toilet.... You can find it at health food stores. Also flax seed oil is great to add to your daily diet it has great health benifits:) ***when your baby is old enough to eat solid food I would talk to his Dr about adding flax seed oil to his diet, the fat that comes from it is just what his little brain needs to grow:)<br>  Good luck!!!!
ytE1q20taa	The butt pain could be sciatica, very painful, both me and my mum have it, ask your doctor if he can refer you to someone who will give you exercises to help it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's probably due to how the baby is sitting. It's best to ask your doctor to make sure.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	Make sure you notify your doctor, just in case you are in preterm labor of some kind.<br>  <br>  But I also had this around 30-33 weeks. When I moved around, changed positions, the baby changed position and it went away. My doctor figured the baby was in a position that was pressing on my pelvic area/rectum.<br>  <br>  My OB's advice was to drink lots of water and get plenty of rest. And if it happened again to move around a bit to see if I could change the baby's position. If that didn't help I was to go back in and see her. But after that, I was able to get the baby to move every time and the pain went away.|`|PYySLOw6aa	I had this when Iwas pregnant and the doctor told me that  It was the way my baby was sitting but because everyone is different I would ask the doctor|`|dsUDIUlHaa	i'd consult ur dr just to be sure.  it could be just how the baby is lying but i think its best to find out now just to reassure urself|`|uOp2sdiQaa	your baby could be dropping.|`|dJx5eKx3aa	Your baby could be sitting very low, like mine, I actually have what you're talking about constantly. although im having mine this week, so that might be part of it for me. but talk to your doctor, you might be in preterm labor, you might not but best to be sure. If you know your baby is head down, they could have their face to your stomach which would make their head push on your sciatic nerve causing the back pain.|`|ea6Yk54raa	Have you seen your doctor? It could be a few things the norm like the uterus stretching or something more serious like a varicose veins in the vaginal area they can sometimes cause a lot of pain butdon'tt be shy to ask your doctor. Good Luck!|`|EkrG57WDaa	hey im 40 weeks an i have had this since abt 25 weeks...its called hip dispalcier (cant spell it but its all to do with ur ligiments losening an ur hips not conjoining properly anymore..ask ur midwife to explain it more but dont worry its all normal...but u may need physio
Coc593Ikaa	Babies cannot make sounds while in the womb. The reason for this is simple. Sounds are made when we pass air over our vocal cords. Babies in the womb are completely surrounded by fluid. They do not breathe until they are born. This is why we want to hear a baby cry when they are born, it is proof that they have taken their first breath and that their lungs are functioning.<br>  <br>  However, while they can't make sounds, they can make expressions. They can make faces (smiles and grimaces and such)! And they suck their thumb and such.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	yes they do!!!...they may not be able to make noises but they certainly go thru the motions|`|0iUxfCMcaa	i do know the cry but i dont think theres sound with it when they cry in the womb. they make the faces like they are crying and smiling and everything.|`|DVmDWDC4aa	Their lungs are full of liquid, so no.<br>  <br>  You can hear a heartbeat outside the womb, and, as with my first pregnancy, you can sometimes even hear a soft clicking noise later on when baby sucks its thumb!
3qI1oyFaaa	I'm not sure if it's the same thing as far along as you, but I'm at 27 weeks and over the past few weeks I've experienced these a few times-- a sharp pain from your bellybutton straight down and "out", all the way through your vagina? Starts out of nowhere, comes and goes for 20-30 minutes and then stops as suddenly as it came? I asked my doc about this, and she said they're just round ligament pains. She suggested to drink some water, lay on your left side, and curl as close to the fetal position as you can get (which isn't too far with your belly though :) ) I would try that, and if it doesn't help, definitely call your doc, cause it could be related to labor that far along.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	does your tummy get hard as a rock when you have these pains? if so then time them they are contractions. if they are contractions call your doctor asap 34wks baby is still alittle early to be born yet. but baby will survive if it is born now so dont stress.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	It could be a number of things depends on where on your stomach they are located. If you are having contractions or back ache with these pains. any discharge. did you get enough fluids today...best bet call your doctor see if they want you to go to the hospital|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	yes it called braxton hicks its where you start to have contractions but you are not there yet,time your contractions and when you have gone from one or two every thirty minutes to one every five min. then its time to go to the hospital.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	Be safe and call your dr. I would it may be contractions but if not i would rather have a professional know what is going on.|`|w17xLr8waa	pre term labor contractions?|`|WyC6xhW0aa	sweetie get a watch and start timing each time that pain comes, if you start feeling that pain every 5 minutes ,constantly.Those are contractions and at this time (5min.apart) you need to go to the hospital. IF YOU'RE BLEEDING SIGNIFICALLY,OR YOUR WATER BREAKS(you'll know if you're water breaks,because it feels like blood flowing ,when you get your period)YOU NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL ASAP. TAKE CARE AND GOOD LUCK DON'T panic,if you got you're Dr.s phone number don't hesitate to call. :)|`|L7S24gkEaa	it could be early labour or maybe braxton hicks. does your tummy get hard for a few seconds and then relax at this time? <br>  it is likely that it is yet more ligaments stretching if it happens mostly when you move suddenly ( ie.. get up , sit down, stretch, etc.. ) <br>  best speak to your midwife or labour ward at the hospital if you are worried. there will always be a midwife in labout ward 24 / 7 if you need to tank to her  out of hours.|`|c1WrWhscaa	It could be braxton hicks (practice contractions) but if accompanied by bleeding or "water" it could be early labor - best to get to your doc asap to make sure all is ok :)
pR4nLjyRaa	I've had 2 miscarriages. <br>  It really does take the 'fun' out of being pregnant, I'm 9 weeks pregnant now and can't enjoy a moment of it. I'm constantly worried but so far everything seems to be going great! <br>  Don't worry about never having a baby, the majority of women who miscarry go on to have healthy babies in the future!<br>  Good luck and sorry about your loss.|`|YzUPmWTBaa	My 1st pregnancy ended in a miscarriage after 3months, last yr september. Im still heartbroken, I feel empty, and yes.. Like a failure. Its the hardest thing to hear and see how unsympathetic people are, when they have no idea how you feel. I try to understand that everything happens for a reason and that God knows whats best for us. That helps me through the day. Im also scared, but trying again and I believe that my next pregnancy will last.. So should you. Good luck, baby dust xxx|`|5axGfFofaa	I have had 2 one in Aug and on in Jan...it is SOoO sad and heartbreaking.  It is very common and it does not mean you cannot have a baby.  Odds of having 2 are only like 4 % and odds of 3 are only like 1 %.  I am sorry for your loss and pain.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I had 2 and am currently 29w. It's tough to "get over it" but as time passes it'll be easier to try again. It's not your fault. 1 in 4 pregnancies fail.|`|O4dRKMYnaa	I just had an ectopic pregnancy two weeks ago, where the egg implants in the fallopian tube, which is even rarer.  I was 6 weeks pregnant and didn't even know until 2 days before I lost it.  It is really rough loosing a baby and at first, i was scared to even try again.  I am at higher risk to have another one.  I only have one tube left (they had to do surgery to remove my tube, it actually ruptured and caused me to bleed internally.)  That is why i am so afraid, i don't want to go through it again, but i now i have changed my mind and we will begin trying in a year or so to give my body and soul time to heal.  With one tube, it may be harder for me to get pregnant too, i don't know.  I just pray that one day, we are able to have a  healthy baby, or two or three.<br>  i will pray for you too.<br>  It is so hard seeing pregnant people and babies around you.  It reminds you of what you have lost.  Just be strong and don't be afraid to try again.  Do you know what, if anything, caused the last miscarriage? that alone can help you prepare for another try.|`|jPnXGIZNaa	Dont be so hard on your self! I had a m/c in Oct. I was 12weeks 6 days.. <br>  Its hard not to be sad or discouraged, but with time and patients it will happen again! If it happend once it can surely happen again. <br>  I think people who have never had a m/c before dont understand how painful and hurtful it can be and they say what they think is right when in fact it doesnt make you feel better. Everyone kept saying to me "its okay, try again" but it wasnt okay! <br>  They say about 15-20% of pregancies end in m/c, and most of the time there is nothing you could have done to stop it. <br>  Take some time to take care of yourself and your relationship, and when you guys are ready you can try again, and you will be blessed with a baby in time!|`|fMjCE7hDaa	I've been pregnant 4 times.  The 1st one was a miscarriage, the 2nd one was an etopic pregnancy (had to have emergency surgery) and the 3rd pregnancy I had my son and my 4th pregnancy was a miscarriage . That one hit me the hardest.  The first 2 pregnancies I was young and called them a blessing in descize ( i know I spelt that wrong can't think today). But the last miscarriage was extremley hard on me.  My husband and I was planning this one so it was really hard. With my 3rd pregnancy I was really conscience.  I made 4 hospital trips but  I did enjoy it.  Just be optimistic and don't look back on the past look towards the future.  My son is my pride and joy.  So, just think positive.|`|dlOFWcU4aa	I had a miscarriage in July 2007 and me and my husband just started trying again in Jaunuary.  We just now are starting to "get over it."

AA11764194	Yes.. I also had 2 miscarriages in a row and had a healthy baby boy after wards..I went to specialist after I had my 2 miscarriages.. he put me on progesterone pills..<br>  <br>  I know miscarriage is very depressing and sad. but it is way body is saying that there is something wrong with the pregnancy..since you already have kid you can carry baby full term.. my suggestion is go to a specialist.. Good luck..|`|CPwdVc4caa	I know a woman who miscarried upwards of 6 times in between each of her babies; she conceived easily, but for whatever reason, the pregnancies just wouldn't take.  She wound up having 5 children in the end :)  There's always hope; you just need to have faith and keep trying.|`|ZMnD5s7laa	my mother had two miscarriages but not back to back (although i'm sure it would have been back to back if she wasn't insaminated)<br>  after my mother had me and my younger brother she had her tubes tied- after she remarried my step dad she had them undone and had a miscarriage. Tubal pregnancy- she has one good ovary and one bad ovary as well as only one good tube and one bad tube b/c of the surgury. Her god ovary was at the bad tube and vice versa so any chance of her getting pregnant on her own was slim to none and/or a miscarriage. She and my step dad finally went to the doctor and she was insaminated with his sperms-she gave birth to twin baby boys who are doing great (5 years old now)<br>  A year after the boys were born, she got pregnant again even though she was told she wouldn't ever be able to again. The baby went i think 5 or 6 months then it's heart stopped beating....never found a cause nor anything. After that, my step dad had a vesectimy ( i know thats misspelled.) <br>  I know some people don't agree with getting insaminated becasue they think it's taking life into their own hands and not letting God do it, but the way I see it- God knows there are women (and men) to have problems getting pregnant so he made humans to be smart enough to learn how do this stuff. If he really doesn't want you to have kids he won't put a soul in that body. It is expensive but I'd say cheack with the doctor and if they can't find out anything why you had the miscarriages then try being insaminated<br>  <br>  P.S. who ever said it was easy getting pregnant? Maybe it wasn't ment to be easy, maybe it was ment for us to work for the joy of children?|`|bql2RJzWaa	I had 7 miscarriges! I now have 2 beautiful children=)<br>  Both were full term & no complications (except my high blood pressure).<br>  There IS hope!!<br>  I miscarried in April & was pregnant with my son in June...<br>  Also, you can take prenatal vitamins starting now! I swear by them!!|`|rwodna0waa	first of all let me tell you i feel your pain. i had two miscarriages before i became pregnant with my son. he is almost three now and is doing fine! your time will come honey, don't worry. Also, there is a great web-site you should go to....<br>  <br>  www.missedmiscarriage.com|`|oHpLeYQ2aa	My mom had my older brother, two miscarriages, and then me (and then two more kids after that). So yes, absolutely there is hope. Good luck, and I'm very sorry for your losses.
CL4p7fccaa	We have two dogs.  We started in early pregnancy restricting the areas of the house they could go into ie bedrooms.   They also started spending more time outside when we were home so they got used to not being around us even if we were there.<br>  <br>  I put the carseat on the floor before baby was born and let the dogs have a little sniff - same with the stroller which was something they had never seen before, so they wouldn't freak out when it came out for the first time.<br>  <br>  We are due next week but we have been advised to bring a blanket of babys home from the hospital ( before baby comes home) and let the dogs sniff it in their own time - dont let them touch it - tell them 'no' if they try to pick it up.   This teaches them babys smell and that you are ok with this new smell so they have to be as well.<br>  <br>  Once baby is home. Keep the dog away from their face but interact with dog by talking to it while you are holding the baby so it realises baby is not a threat to its position in the house.<br>  <br>  Always watch dog around baby - NEVER leave them alone together.   <br>  <br>  Make walks with dog and baby in stroller an positive outing for the dog.<br>  <br>  We had a dog when our older children were babies & they were fantastic together - but always stay alert !|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	you have to decide which one you want more - the baby or the dog.. the dog is an animal - tamed one moment and can turn into a vicious beast the next (i am not talking about any specific breeds but about dogs in general).. plus, the dog was there first and i am not sure it will "allow" another competitor in - all the time spent with the baby and attention given to the baby the dog will treat as "stolen" from it.. some dogs are straight forward about their feelings but i am not sure you will be up for an impromptu loud barking or the dog can hide its true feelings and turn on the baby later on.. once again, it's a personal choice - to be an optimist and trust the dog or to be a realist..|`|wURg3jBcaa	We have 2 yellow labs and a tabby cat, and I was definitely worried about introducing them to baby.  I will say that I think your pets will instinctually know that this is your offspring, and shouldn't be messed with if they want to still be in your good graces.<br>  <br>  The cat ignored our baby, and the dogs wanted to sniff- which we let them.  If they tried to get too close without supervision, they were given a stern 'no' and they backed-off.  <br>  <br>  It really depends upon the personality of your pets.  If they're normally mellow, I wouldn't worry too much.  Just keep it supervised, and you'll be okay.
9tARaFTOaa	i cant believe some of the answers on here!!<br>  good for you wanting to breastfeed. some people may not want to give their baby other womens breastmilk because it makes them feel uncomfortable but you do and it just shows how dedicated you are to giving your baby the best start in life.<br>  id ask your health visitor/midwife as there may be a 'milk bank' near you and you shouldn't have to pay for this milk.<br>  all milk is checked, just as blood would be!!<br>  i dont know what your reasons are for not being able to breastfeed but if you ask your health visitor/midwife they may be able to help, most women can breastfeed but often its learning to attach the baby correctly.<br>  if not, good for you for trying all avenues, breastmilk will make a massive difference to your babys health|`|pXSKSS3daa	Here is just an example:<br>  <br>  "The Mothers' Milk Bank of Denver, Colorado charges $2.25/ounce plus $0.25/ounce if shipped.

Remember the HIV virus can be transmitted through breast milk. Besides breast milk does not have a great shelf life. It must be stored at specific temperatures and even when frozen is only good for so long. <br>  Don't stress yourself out over wanting to give your baby breast milk, formula can be beneficial as well.|`|YWe5fYAhaa	I heard it can be quite expensive.

I like it. Variations could be Rowan, Rayn & Raven. I don't like Faith.<br>  Ainsley Grace - I like Grace but not Ainsley.<br>  Charlotte Lee - I like Charlotte but not Lee. <br>  Landon Michael - I like Michael but not Landon, and Michael Landon was the actor who played Pa on Little House on the Prairie.<br>  Keaton Joel - meh, no.<br>  Teagan Daniel - I know a girl named Teagan so I will always see it as a feminine name. I like Daniel.
kaqPSgTVaa	Every woman is different. With my first I was able to get a positive only on the day my period was due. With my current I was able to get a positive 4 days before my period was due.<br>  <br>  The reason it's different is because of implantation dates. Your body doesn't start producing HCG, the pregnancy hormone, until implantation has occured. Implantation can occur anywhere from 4-16 days (sometimes longer) past ovulation. It usually takes a week past implantation to read a positive on a home urine test because it takes time for the pregnancy hormone to build up in your body.<br>  <br>  So lets say based on that info (and going by the later implantation date) you ovulate on the 14th of the month and implant on the 30th. Your'e period would have been due the 28th but not enough hormone has built up in system to read a positive. You most likely wouldn't get a positive until almost a week into the next month putting you over a week late. <br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense. It's different for everyone|`|XhIYAH6Laa	It all depends on how much hcg is in your urine. You may not have enough just yet, wait a couple days and retest with first morning urine. Good Luck|`|ox6SXta4aa	With my first two it was positive 4 days early - this pregnancy I was 5 days late before it showed up positive!  Every pregnancy is different and it's possible it won't show up for a while - I would suggest getting a blood test from the doctor to know for sure.|`|afAbSq5gaa	It is different for everyone, some it will show sooner than others, it all depends on the amont of hcg that your body is producing at the time that u take the test id wait another week and then test again!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	It took an entire week after my missed period before I got a positive result on a home pregnancy test..|`|rBYU0VTUaa	Mine was positive 5 day AFTER my missed period.|`|gEtg9LOiaa	I was three months pregnant before I got a positive with my first child. I had irregular periods for those three months and would miss a month.
ahjqc9Ifaa	Like a lot of popular names, Morgan started out as a surname (last name), then was used as a first name for boys, and now has been usurped as a girl's name, kind of like Taylor, Madison, etc.<br>  <br>  So it's genderless.|`|iHna2K7Gaa	Morgan is a unisex name that began as a surname, so it can be used for male or females.<br>  <br>  For it to be exclusively feminine, it would be spelled as "Morrigan" or you would add an 'a' at the end to make it "Morgana".<br>  <br>  Even as a unisex name, if I see the name "Morgan" spelled as so, I assume it to be a boy's name.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	It is for a male or female though it actually originated as a male name. Its more popular for a girls name now so thats probably why they ask.|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	I don't approve of the American fondness for giving surnames as first names (eg: Morgan, Jefferson, Harrison etc) but if you must, Morgan is far more masculine than feminine.|`|xLPB0Z2maa	Female! Female! Female!<br>  _edit_________________________<br>  <br>  Morgan is a pretty name and Peyton, Riley, and Ryan are boys names.|`|ctMLdGg9aa	i only know girls with morgan but i think it's unisex.|`|y4xFNvBaaa	morgan is a female name.|`|AA11540024	it's both|`|tTDvpuGPaa	Morgan is an unisex name.|`|tLcOikV8aa	its a female name. but its cute as a boy dog name.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i hear morgan and i think girl|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Truthfully, i prefer it for a girl. I know 4 girls named Morgan and 1 guy; <br>  Girl: Morgan Laura B. "Morrie" (Morrie is Morgan - gan + ry = Morrie)<br>  <br>  Girl: Morgan Anna B. "Anna" (Goes by her middle name)<br>  <br>  Girl: Morgan Cheyenne S. "Morgan" (Goes by her name)<br>  <br>  Girl: Morgan Dahlia Z. "Pippy" (We call her Pippy because she isn't the brightest kid)<br>  <br>  Boy: Morgan James I. "M.J." ( Goes by First. Middle. Initals)<br>  <br>  So where i live it is girly|`|gq5sfgE5aa	I think it's more of a girl name. I was signing out music for figure skaters and in the same flight alone there were two named Morgan. I like it for your dog though...well depending on what type of dog it is . I think it's good for a German Shepperd but not really for a Chihuahua. Like big dogs yes and little dogs, well, not so much.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I think Morgan is originally a male name. In recent years, people seem to use it more for girls.<br>  <br>  Morgan Freeman, the actor, is male. I personally think it is a better name for a boy.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	to me, Morgan is one of the few unisex names that I actually like on both genders.<br>  <br>  So both!|`|z7w6xyOKaa	It can be male or female
kjgonYlgaa	Most Dr's. prefer that you deliver naturally.  I begged my Dr. for a C- Section for my 1st and really begged for my 2nd, (I ended up having a super easy super quick delivery with my 1st but the had major complications after).  I delivered natural both times.  I had no complications with my second except that I was so scared, I wasn't using my brain to let me push, and my daughters head was the size of mine.  My delivery was longer than it should have been but that was my fault.  If your dr. suggests a C-section that's probably what's best for both you and the baby, Don't feel like you haven't fulfilled your duties as a mother if you don't deliver naturally.  However if the size of the baby is the only factor in play here just think about all the moms that have delivered larger babies than that with Absolutely no pain meds. and turned out fine.|`|pXSKSS3daa	An 11 lb. baby, though big, doesn't automatically mean C-section. I was 10 lbs. at birth and my brother was 11 lbs. at birth. My mother delivered both vaginally just fine.<br>  <br>  A doctor wants a vaginal birth for their patient first and foremost. It's less risky and most won't do a C-section unless medically necessary. Your doctor will monitor your baby and their growth throughout your pregnancy and, unless needed, will probably not push for a C-section.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Try naturally first, of course.<br>  <br>  In my experience, if it comes down to having a c-section without any other options, you are usually on board with it by the time that becomes clear.  But there's no reason to do it unless it's really necessary.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my neighbor gave birth to an 11 pound 2 ounce baby boy 8 months ago naturally- some doctors will bully you into a c-section because you may take too long. but most are pretty good about avoiding it. some doctors are c-section happy though. they tried to push me for one because i was taking too long according to their standards but i refused. msot cases you will try vaginally first though. i belive the epidural is what stalled my labor and i regret getting it|`|3NyM1cq5aa	My doctor told me that if your mother had a c-section, you have a 49% chance of having one, but there was only one study done on this.  <br>  Most doctors want you to have your baby vaginally if possible, and only resort to c-sections if it is medically necessary.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Baby's weight is more likely to come down your side of the family than your fiances. Also, weight really doesn't matter. Fat is squishy. It's head size that makes a difference.<br>  <br>  Unless you or your baby is thought to be at risk, it's most unlikely that a c-section would be pushed on you.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well depending on your size generally now if the baby is over 10 lbs they do it by c-section, not every doctor though. I think there is a 50/50 chance it will be that way. I think you need to talk to your doc about this and see what they say.|`|7N4AtRogaa	All doctors should opt for a natural delivery if at all possible, and if they don't then I suggest you find another doctor.  They body can do amazing things, don't doubt what you can do.  <br>  <br>  I have had 2 c-section babies, my first due to unforeseen circumstances and my 2nd scheduled due to the risks of trying a v-back.  I wish I could have done things naturally, but sometimes it doesn't work out.  Naturally should always be the first choice though.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	I think you need to wait it out. I'm sure the doctor is planning on you to deliever vaginal. If the baby is too big, you'll have a c-section. You're doctor will plan for this. When you get closer to your due date, Id ask the doctor how much baby weighs. If you need a c-section than it can be planned. It's possible for you to deliever a 10lb baby and be fine.|`|AA10938311	Communicate your concerns with your OB.  If the baby is too large C-section may be the way to go.  You might want to discuss being induced early to have a vaginal birth.  At every ultrasound they estimate the baby's weight.  Ask your OB at what weight would a C-section be absolutely necessary and see if you can be induced before that time.  Also keep in mind the development of the baby at that time.  We all want a healthy baby. I hope this helps.  Good Luck and Congratulations!|`|PJBjllsVaa	if you would rather try naturally of course the DR is going to let you do that. the only way that they would push a csection on you is if something was wrong.|`|AA11540024	I'm sure your doctor would let you know if it was impossible to have it naturally. He will try the natural first unless there were complications.|`|AA11599140	Whether or not you'll have a c-section is in the hands or er, the opinion, of your doctor. There are *medical* reasons to have csections and there are *opinoins* and all doctors differ on this view. Some doctors are willing to respect their clients and let them labor and birth naturally, while others want the easy way out - no messy or long labors, no potential for trouble (according to them) and less likely to get sued.....<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to communicate your wishes now to your obstetrician.  21 weeks is a pefect time to do so.  Ask what his csection rate is, when does he find it necessary to do a csection, and how long will he generally allow labor to continue before he feels that intervention is necessary.  If he gets offended at these questions - hit the door running and never return.  A fair obstetrician is one who evaluates the situations that come up, respects a woman's body to work as it generally does and makes suggestions.  <br>  <br>  At 21 weeks, you still have the ability to change doctors if you don't like the answer that you get.  You should also ask now about the induction rate and at what point does he suggest induction.  If he says that by 40 weeks he's gonna induce if you haven't delivered, I'd either be prepared to ask more questions or find another ob...its a known fact that inductions started for non-medical reasons increase your chance of having a csection.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|YP1DXbBDaa	Unless you've got uncontrolled diabetes (gestational or otherwise) or had a nutritional deficiency as a child, your body won't grow a baby too big for you to give birth to vaginally...which means that while it may be harder than giving birth to a seven pound baby, you can give birth to an eleven pound baby.<br>  <br>  Things that you could do-avoid induction...induction raises your risk of a c-section. <br>  <br>  Don't get an epidural-while it sounds scary to some people, this actually will help you know where the baby is positioned and when to push or not push-this can help also to minimize tearing to the vagina, too. <br>  <br>  Don't  labor or give birth  laying on your back-laboring and pushing on your hands and knees, squatting, sitting, and other positions will help use gravity to move your baby down and into a good position to give birth.  You'll be able to find comfortable positions that help optimize the shape of your pelvis, opening up your hips and allowing the baby to move into your pelvic cavity and down through the birth canal.  <br>  <br>  Talk to a midwife.  If  you want to birth in a hospital and not at home or in a birthing center (both of which are as safe or safer for a low risk pregnancy) there are midwives who do that.  Many midwives are better at avoiding c-sections than doctors are.  Take a good birthing class-I like Bradley Method or Hypnobirthing, but  make sure whatever you choose focuses on low intervention, unmedicated birth.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope it works out for you.
AA11296427	They can, yes.

The duration of how long it's in your pee hinges on how much crack you've been smoking for the past few weeks and how many fluids you've been drinking.  <br>  <br>  Also realize that drug tests will pick up the metabolites of cocaine as well (the stuff your body turns crack into after you're not high any more), which can stay in your system for more than a month if you've been using for a prolonged time. <br>  <br>  As a 16 year old girl, I would suggest you stop smoking crack while you still have the time/ability to quit and a full life ahead of you.|`|baEs4ZcJaa	Yes they can. I think it takes about a month to pass the test. My friend had to get one, and sadly she didn't pass.

I was almost in tears like why am I breaking out!?<br>  I'm 20 so I figured maybe it was hormonal since I was due for my period soon.<br>  But my husband and I were thrilled to find out it was due to hormones alright!

You can get any of the brands that the sell at walmart and at this point they will be accurate.|`|QQUZRXa3aa	for most people the symptoms dont arrive until later. if you both are really worried, wait about a week before her next period and take a test or go get a blood test if you want to know sooner.|`|hsp7f9Epaa	well It could possilby be have her take a test

8XcRFF6Taa	Well it's awesome your breastfeeding and willing to do the pumping, it's hard work,lol.<br>  <br>  I suggest using breastmilk storage bags for long term storage anything more than a couple of days.  Your breastmilk can be stored in a freezer for up to 3 months.  The fridge only 3 days.  So if the milk you just pumped is going to be used that day, you don't need to worry about freezing it and you can just leave it in a bottle:)  Don't ever mix breastmilk that isn't the same temperature, I don't remember why your not supposed to but I remember reading not to.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i froze it in breast milk storage bags- i got the most milk in the mornings- you can *** to frozen milk but the milk has to be cooled first so it doesn't thaw out teh already frozen stuff|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.mother-2-mother.com/storemilk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mother-2-mother.com/storemilk...</a><br>  When freezing your milk, there are several things to take into consideration. The type of container chosen may be important if the bulk of your baby's milk is frozen milk. In that case, freezing in glass is best because it is less porous and offers the best protection in the freezer. If the frozen milk is for occasional bottles, the type of container is not as important. Also keep in mind that freezing does destroy most of the leukocytes, so whenever possible the bulk of baby's expressed breastmilk should be "fresh" vs frozen.<br>  <br>  Hard plastic containers of any kind are also good choices for both refrigeration and freezing<br>  <br>  Another option is to use milk storage bags that are designed specifically for human milk. These are available from several sources, including on line sources as well as local stores like Kmart, Target, and Wal-Mart stores. These bags are pre-sterilized, thicker, coated with polyethylene, and lined with nylon, which prevents the fat from sticking to the sides.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Can I Freeze My Milk After It Has Been Refrigerated Several Days?<br>  <br>  Yes - most sources seem to indicate that you should be safe to use ALL the storage options in succession if you need to.<br>  <br>  For example, storing freshly expressed breastmilk at room temperature for up to 10 hours, THEN in a refrigerator for up to 8 days, and THEN in a freezer for 3-12 months (depending on the type of freezer).<br>  <br>  You're likely to get to stretch your storage times to the maximum (or even a little longer) if you don't "use up" all of your "warmer" storage - for example, you can expect a longer storage time if you freeze the milk immediately (if you know you'll want it frozen) rather than keep it at room temp for 10 hours, then refrigerate for 8 days and THEN freeze the milk.<br>  <br>  Even though storage times may be decreased, most bf experts suggest *not* throwing out any milk before the maximum storage time unless when you warm it you notice that it has a very distinct foul smell. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/storagehandling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/sto...</a><br>  While it was originally thought that a mother had to cool her fresh breastmilk before combining it with previously expressed cooled milk, the latest research now shows that you may pump directly into already refrigerated or cooled milk as long as the milk is added within 24 hours of the first milk expressed. You should then follow the storage recommendations based upon the time and date of the first milk expressed. You may pump directly into milk that has been stored at room temperature as long as you do so within 10 hours. This milk would need to then be used.<br>  <br>  You may add your fresh milk to what you have already frozen as long as you chill the fresh milk first for about half an hour and it is a smaller amount than the amount that you are adding it to.|`|lCbsCM6raa	These are not dumb questions. I remember having the same ones.<br>  You can freeze the milk in bottles, but I found it easier to buy the bags made for milk storage. And, yes, you can put the milk from the morning in the freezer and then add to it in the afternoon. Or, you can just keep the morning milk in the fridge and then add the afternoon milk to it and put it in the freezer once you have a full bottle. This is what I usually do.|`|deIzFnV8aa	You should freeze milk in _glass bottles_ (awkward) or the special milk bags they sell (easier to store, since they are flat) to avoid losing the fats.<br>  <br>  You can def. combine milk from pumping sessions, just cool the milk a bit before adding it to the older milk.  Date the whole thing with the oldest date.<br>  <br>  There have been several Y!A questions about this subject lately - there is a lot of additional info about pumping and storing here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=A0WTc6OpHKNJdJIAQwjty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090214080623AA1GjSK&show=7#profile-info-5d5ebf56303675678665f908716238a1aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps and let me know if you have other questions; I did a lot of research on it before I started pumping for my daughter.|`|CIoBBtNhaa	You can store in bottles, but it is so much easier to store in milk storage bags.  They're pretty inexpensive, and hold up to 6 oz of milk.  While it is possible to add to the frozen milk, just know that the amount that is fresh cannot be more than what is frozen so that the frozen milk doesn't thaw.  Once it has thawed, it cannot be refrozen, and needs to be used within 24 hours.  Milk that is frozen can be stored for 3 months in a regular freezer, but not in the door.  If it is in the door, it only lasts 2 weeks.  Also, if you don't want to freeze it, it will last 8-10 days in the fridge.  I often pump some and then add it to what I've already pumped that is stored in the fridge.  That way, if you decide it's too much for your baby, you can always freeze it and it will last another 3 months.  Just make sure it is dated, and use the oldest milk first.  Hope that's useful!|`|7Rs2z1UIaa	Keep in mind that natural breast milk will not keep long. I tried pumping when my son was a baby and by the end of the day, the milk from the morning had curdled. Though, I'm told there are plenty of ways to keep this from happening nowadays. I think your best answer will come from contacting your local La Leche League or your baby's doctor.
rQJLU2ndaa	I am not sure... but I know that in the 1st trimester of pregnancy your progesterone level is usually between 10 and 47. So your number still looks good! I will say a prayer for you! Good luck!!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Hcg double every 2 to three days.  It never drops off and it levels out at the end of the first trimester.  When you reach 12 weeks it is usually in the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands.  The only reason for a drop would be a loss|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. I am sorry but I am afraid that I don't have very good news. I am a phlebotomist/ma and usually your b-HCG leves 2x every 2 sometimes 3 days but they don't drop unless there is something wrong. The thing is tho, that nothing is ever 100% tho. Did you have this test done with 2 different labs?? Sometimes the b-HCG at one lab is just a little bit different from another. I would just try to keep positive hun. Lets pray that everything works out for u!!!!! <3 ur in my prayers hun!<3<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT::: the nurse may have said BETA hcg. It sounds a bit like A. Neways if they were done at different labs try and get them all done at the same one b/c they really can be very different. So hang in there hun!!!!! Having no blood/pain may be a good thing. Just hang in there! I have been in limbo with this pregnancy since the start and its HARD so if you need to talk or have some questions feel free to email me! I would be GLAD to help u out!!! <3<3|`|dlOFWcU4aa	Mine did that.  Mine peaked at 93,000.  Then we never could get a heartbeat and my blood test showed that my HcG levels were dropping and they told me that I had a Blighten Ovum.  I never miscarried or was in any pain.  I had to have surgery to remove the fetal pole.  Keep your head up and I am going to be praying for you. I know it is tough.|`|gQrvOPhjaa	Aw, same thing happened to me and i wound up miscarrying a few days later.  I'm sorry =(
z3TIcyI6aa	Hi!<br>  <br>  I am not a parent yet but have had a few experience's using pram's etc on the tubes with my cousin in law who is American and found it all a bit confusing and a bit frightening :0) the first time we did it she freaked out but I managed fine as I use the tubes a lot.<br>  Yes you can, but it can be difficult if you have other kids with you though as for example going up, you will need both hands to keep the back wheels of pushchair or pram up, while the front wheels are on the escalator steps in front.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most people I found were very helpful and would often give a hand. Rush hour is probably not the best time to be on the tubes and you might not get as much help. Burt can be done.<br>  But other than that, I have now used several different types of prams//buggies and pushchairs on the tube and found it can be ok. It's the steps that can be a bit of a killer!<br>  <br>  You can also phone the travel info line and ask about step free tube stops and those with lifts to help you out!<br>  0207 222 1234 or tfl.gov.uk<br>  Good Luck!|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Yes.
AA10325228	no, but Kendra Lynn is|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No,sorry. Kendral doesn't even sound like a name to me.

Its like the name Cheyanne, but just a different spelling. Oh by the way, Congrats! P.S my name is Shianne! :P|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	Kendral isn't a proper name. It doesn't sound pretty. Kendra is a real name, but I don't like it. Not keen on Lynn either - it's very dated. Your daughter though, so your decision!|`|YlLmAADraa	don't have the last letter be the first letter in the next name. other wise it all sounds like one word or you have to over emphasize on the pause between names.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	Kendral isn't very cute.. <br>  <br>  I like Kendal Lynne(: thats cute but Kendral is just horrific! sorry!|`|r5UfVeYbaa	i love it so cute!!! perfect!!! also good is kendra lynn|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Kendra Lynn, yes.|`|w7XNcmihaa	Yes. :)|`|H2v3QFWRaa	its different and i like it.|`|sidLV3Zkaa	NO WAY.  Lynn is a boy name all the way.  And I don't like it then either.   How about Kendral Cai?  Pronounced like the letter K.  I like that you did not go with Kendall too.|`|vdVVZiY6aa	I Prefer Kendra to Kendral because the L in Kendral and the L in Lynn sorta blend when you say it outloud, But the name isn't too bad=]|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I like Kendra Lynn not Kendral Lynn.

PwhrTNZraa	I didn't "try" eating anything different to help when TTC, but I will tell you that all 3 times I got pregnant, I had decided to start eating right and exercising to try to lose some weight and wouldn't you know.  I got my very first BFP 2 months after starting at Curves, healthy baby girl.  I got my second BFP when I started eating right again last Feb08, ended in miscarriage in March and this last BFP I got in Nov08, I went back on my weight loss plan and within 2 weeks I was pregnant, currently 18weeks.  <br>  <br>  There is no "secret food" or anything (IMO) of that sort that will up your chances, however eating properly and healthy will probably help.  It certainly can't hurt!!  Good luck!
cj7sSPZEaa	No you do not have to wait that long.  A pregnancy test will be accurate as soon as the first day of your missed period, and some tests work 5 days before your missed period.  The 6 weeks comment probably came from a person who's pregnancy didn't show on a test as soon as most people.  Sometimes there is not enough hcg to produce a positive result even though you are pregnant.  If you get a negative, then go to the doctor for a blood test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You don't have to wait 6 weeks. Usually women get accurate results 14 days past ovulation or sex. It can take longer for some women though depending on when implantation occurred. It's usually 14 days though.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Some pregnancy test kits are accurate before you even miss your period but if you use them when your period is due it may show negative and you end up having to retest a few days later.<br>  <br>  You are best to wait until your period is 4-5 days late and then test, you should get a more accurate result.|`|zSABr7praa	I took HPT a week BEFORE my period was due (I don't recommend that, it's a good way to get a false negative, I was lucky.)  6 weeks is a joke.  Most people on here aren't doctors, just here to give you advice and answers through experience.  The answers you get aren't always facts.  Best of luck!|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	You usually can get results 12-16 after you ovulate which is about the time you would have started your period.  Some tests are accurate before that date but if it comes up negative I would test again if your period doesnt start the day your expect it.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you do not have to wait that long.<br>  <br>  you have to wait a week or couple days after your missed period...|`|QQUZRXa3aa	I just waited untill my next period was due and i took a 5 days sooner test a  couple days before i was expecting my next period and i was pregnant! calculate when ur suppost to have you next period and take a 5 day sooner test......if that doesnt work just wait it out, time will tell if you dont have your period.|`|O4dRKMYnaa	You can find out sooner than that.  If you have missed your period then take a test, but still take another one in a few days to a week.  the further along you are, the more pregnancy horomones that you have.  Take the test first thing in the morning too.|`|6359becf9ea83832470afde520533f08aa	I didn't even have to take a test and I knew I was pregnant. A person can tell by the way their body feels. I took 4 tests and they all came back very light. You could barley see the line on the test. Go the doctor and have them do a blood test.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	take the test on the day you expect you period should begin. that will be accurate enough. If you are already late then take a test anytime|`|p3d3E75oaa	no not 6 weeks you can take a test up to a week before your period is due good luck|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	You can test up to 6 days before your period is due. If you're late you can test.<br>  <br>  I hope you get the answer you want!|`|AA11540024	pregnancy tests are so far advanced now that you can take it a few days after the day you think you got pregnant on. I would wait at least 2 weeks though to be sure.|`|0UzfNoA2aa	i only waited a week to do a test. which was positive. 6 weeks is a long time to wait to find out.|`|IYg7TUd1aa	THATS NOT TRUE I TOOK A PREGNACY TEST 2DAYS AFTER I MISSED MY PERIOD N IT WAS POSITIVE!!!!!!!!!

tcHkn0VIaa	just take one per day. this is good your your health as well as preventing birth defects especially if you do not eat properly. you can go to the local drug store and look at the lable of all the vitamins to see what makes them different but they are the most important thing you can do if you think you may be pregnant or trying to become pregnant|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You should be getting 400mcg of folic acid per day.  The prenatal is very much like a regular multi, it just has more.  Some can not stomach prenatals and are therefore suggested to take 2 children's chewables per day.  If a multi or even a prenatal is not water soluble it will not fully dissolve in you and you end up pooping most of it out anyhow.  I did a lot of research and have talked to midwives who suggest to take Spirulina (super blue green algae) instead as it has so much more of what the body needs and produces healthier babies|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	prenatal vitamins has all the vitamins your baby will need to develop correctly ...<br>  <br>  you take one per day
86oPkfzOaa	Buy her those leap frog books.When she touches the word in the story she will hear it.At this age children may read some but they doing it by remembering the words not by putting sounds together.She will be able to start to really read when she is about 4.<br>  Your child is doing great ,thanks to you.|`|HqAzo0j9aa	you have to remember that letter sounds are the alphabet, so she will see and hear them all the time. i would ask your parents how you learned. also, she may learn better doing hands on things that help her. also, i think she would love it if you made it funny or something. kids respond better when they can laugh. they remember the fun moments so i would try to make her laugh as much as possible. plus, whats funnier than a laughing baby? its so contagious! lol!
DVmDWDC4aa	If you are bleeding, you could still be pregnant. If you are suffering those symptoms they are caused by hormones. It could be an ectopic pregnancy or you could have miscarried already. Though I had periods throughout my pregnancy.<br>  <br>  You can take a test. It tests for HCG in the urine which is always present if you are pregnant, period or not. If it shows up positive, the pregnancy COULD be abnormal or miscarried, or it could of course be perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  Keeping this all in mind, the symptoms you say are hormone caused, so you could just have a temporary hormone imbalance which is causing the symptoms and your periods to muck about.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	If you're having your period it sounds more like PMS symptoms not pregnancy.  But no you would have to wait until after bleeding of any sort stops or you can go have a blood test done.|`|HahRhoQYaa	if your on your period, i highly doubt your pregnant.|`|a6e7SRYzaa	If you're on your period that is called PMS.

It doesn't taste as bad an they will actually keep it down:0)  Hope this helped!<br>   All the supplements are pretty disgusting,<br>  <br>  Oh, and be careful for the first few days of him taking it, he will be pooping a lot, it's black and stains... so no cute clothes until his body get use to it:)|`|68c6B8dRaa	If your pediatrician was correct we would not have survived -- and flourished -- as a species...<br>  <br>  "Vitamin and mineral supplements are not necessary for the average healthy, full-term breastfed baby during the first year. Breastmilk is all that your baby needs for at least the first six months of life. Studies have shown that vitamins, fluoride, iron, water, juice, formula and solid foods are rarely beneficial to healthy breastfed babies during the first six months, and some can even be harmful. There are certain cases where a vitamin supplement may be needed for a breastfed baby during the first year, but these cases are the exception, not the rule"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/vitamins.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/vitami...</a>|`|lGcpXteaaa	My daughter was prescribed these as there was NO sun when she was born lol<br>  <br>  I just gave her it once every week and she loved the taste. I didnt get the Tri-Vi-Sol though...i got the cheaper kind they are exactly the same. I think it was 'teddies'?? Just ask at the pharmasist.|`|4kfljeIGaa	Our doctor recommended the same thing for our little ones.  What I had to do was pump breastmilk, mix with recommended dose of vitamins in a bottle, and feed it to them that way.  While I did this I would coo at them and tell them how awesome they were, tell them how those "gooood viteys" would make them big and strong.  The contents of the bottles got sucked down without complaints!  <br>  <br>  Hope that works for you.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	It is not necessary.  Baby will get enough Vitamin D from your milk and from sunshine.  No supplement is necessary.

Take the grounding without whining, and actually show her that you are doing better.<br>  summer will, in fact, come and go, whether you are in your room or not, but instead of trying to figure out how to skip out on this, why don't you just accept the consequence without complaint?

When my mom says I'm grounded...then I am GROUNDED .|`|EtTddxAqaa	well, I am a momma and when I say my children are grounded than they ARE GROUNDED! I do not let them beg their way out of it! they obviously did something to deserve the grounding so No i am not going to let a "please Mom" change my mind. I am also a strict parent though. <br>  If my children came begging to me to let them have a summer, I would laugh and say "should have thought about that before YOU screwed up"<br>  I am so sick of kids these days trying to get their parents to un-ground them and when they don't, the kids just get mad saying "I hate my mom she is so unfair" I am so sick of that...YOU KIDS ARE THE ONES WHO MESSED UP. some parents may like to ground their kids but I am not one of those parents, I just do it when I think it is necessary! <br>  I hope you choose me for best answer because I opened your eyes on the subject! It also took a long time to write this haha! (:<br>  I just hope that you can choose me even though I may have not given you what you really wanted to hear...and who knows...maybe your mom is nice and if you beg she will cave.

What did you do to get yourself grounded from your entire summer?
SRsFkNBBaa	you virtually need to make a comittment to change from a certain point on, be consistant, and don't back down. you pretty much need to start over. every single time they disobey you, they need punished. this can range from taking everything out of their rooms, to losing spend the night, and playtime privledges at friends houses. i have even gone so far as cutting my kids from thier sports programs and practices at school. i pay for it, and if they decide they are the boss , they lose it-period. you can do this, it will take a couple weeks , and they won't like you very much, but its better than them growing up disrespectful, negligent, lazy and unsuccessfull.  <br>  and by the way, as far as hitting you, they would get floored if they were mine. this couldn't have just started. just becuase their dad left is no excuse to act like animals. they are using that , or you are using that, im not sure. you have a hard road ahead, but it will be harder if you don't take control now-|`|A0PPXS5uaa	how old are they usually if below 7 make sure your on the level as them look them in the eye do not shout but have a firm tone and try and look angry but not aggresive and repeat what you want them not to do or what you want them to do and if they disobey simply send them to there room without shouting and try and do it in I MEAN BUISSNESS tone TO GET THEM TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY|`|45nSn7Rcaa	There is nothing you can do about it.  Children have to be aloud to express themselves so you can not impose yourself on them and expect them to listen to you. Enjoy it, they are just innocent children.|`|hhJrwRNdaa	It's to late..training kids starts the time they are born. Discipline has been removed for the US language. Most kids now days get their early education from the TV set or Video games.|`|lVa2zYrlaa	You know u have to be real firm with your kids.You are the grown up. There is no reason in this world your child doesn't listen to you.<br>  Now u should have a timeout chair or put them in a corner.Anytime they raise their hand towards u, or disrespects you put them in it. Put You have to stick to this punishment. If they get out put them right back in there. They will cry and scream, but don't give up. At first it will be hard for you to stick through it. If u don't then it will only get worse. <br>   Also maybe they could be bored. A new situation is hard for them also. If they are old enough to ask them questions, ask them what is wrong so yall can talk about it. Then hopefully solve it. Just hang in there mom, if u stick to this u will come out on top.!! Good Luck!!|`|hNr3GFvlaa	That's a handful! I can imagine how difficult and frustrating it may be for you to raise three children at once.<br>  <br>  How old are your children? Hitting you may be a way to express their pain and frustration with a situation. Not listening to you may be a symptom of the lack of modeling of listening in the family. It also matters how many requests you make.<br>  <br>  Children learn their behavior patterns by experience and witnessing. You can't force your children into something you are not modeling.<br>  <br>  You can learn a lot about creating a peaceful relationship with your children from the work of Alfie Kohn: <a href="http://www.alfiekohn.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alfiekohn.com</a>|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Besides calling the Nanny to your rescue...<br>  <br>  This isn't something that gets corrected over night. You really need to be strong and put your foot down. If you give a punishment, follow through with it. The worst mistake parents make are unfulfilled threats. That gets you No where! <br>  <br>  Get everyone on a steady schedule. I have 3 boys and this is our schedule...<br>  <br>  6 pm we set the table and eat dinner<br>  <br>  7pm we have homework time, get everyone sitting down together. If my boys don't have homework then they have to play an educational game on the computer. <br>  <br>  8pm we start showers<br>  <br>  8:30 boys are in their beds for quiet TV or Book time<br>  <br>  9pm is bedtime... My 14 yr old gets computer time from 9pm-10pm, then its lights out for him.<br>  <br>  Getting on a tight schedule will help relieve headaches of fighting and arguing between children. Also, let your kids help with cooking and cleaning up. It makes them feel good to help. I let my 6yr old mop the living room the other. We have all hardwood floors. He used almost a whole container of cleaner, but it looked bright, and he was proud that he did a good job.<br>  <br>  If the kids still don't listen.... Spank some butts!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I'm sorry your relationship ended, but the reality is YOU have to start dealing with your kids.  Put on your big girl panties and deal with it.  YOU are the grown up, YOU make the rules....go get 'em!|`|15qceXaOaa	give them a spanking until they listen. ur the parent and if they dont show u any respect they cant stop u from giving them the whipping they deserve.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Is this true?  If so, you and your children have been victims of domestic abuse.  It's not surprising that they are trying to control you - that's what they saw their father do, and as victims of abuse, they probably feel the need to be in control over something.  You could all benefit from going to a counselor who specializes in these situations.  She could help your family develop more positive and pleasant ways of communicating and interacting.  If you don't know whom to talk to, call a local domestic abuse hotline, women's shelter, or women's clinic, and they will be able to make a recommendation.|`|9F0iuuMYaa	Your kids need to listen to you. You need to figure out what is best for your kids and do it. The reason the kids are probably acting up is because you don't have good parenting skills. You need to discipline them.

I too get hip pain, if it is going to snow or rain real bad, if I walk to long, if I sit a certain way too long etc... but it has thus far had no bearing on having children vaginally, and your dr most likely would not perform a c-section based on a hip dislocation in 7th grade, as it is major surgery
lGcpXteaaa	lol cute little boy! :)<br>  <br>  Well i wouldnt worry too much but i think he kind of just forgot to breath so he has to catch it real quick.

BTW your baby is really cute.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Well,when he does this,you laugh. He's getting the response he wants I suppose. He's trying to entertain..|`|AA11540024	sounds pretty normal to me. That's what Babies do best, making weird noises sometimes.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	I think it's just part of his laugh. He didn't seem to really be gasping for air. I mean he didn't look like he was having issues breathing. Mommy, looks like he's just having fun. It's his personality. Enjoy it. <br>  <br>  My baby baby makes the oddest sounds and cracks herself up. That's just her having fun.|`|YfZYzHRlaa	My nephew did this as well when he was younger. Its because he gets excited! They cant control their bodies when they are excited so the whole thing kinda goes! Gasping for air, shaking their bodies, tensing up, etc...

So its his way of showing his excitement and new trick :o]|`|heDtLdz5aa	i am sorry but i couldn't tell where he was gasping for air....he looks really healthy and very cute..but if you feel that is something of concerncontact your pediatrician...good luck...|`|AA11210211	Are you perhaps blowing on him,babies do that when they have wind blown on them??|`|7rCeCVl2aa	He looks fine to me... Sounds like he is playing...<br>  <br>  Honestly I think (well I hope) if you truly though he was gasping for air or in pulmonary distress you wouldn't be video taping it and posting questions on Y!A... You'd be at the ER
1ezYfkX7aa	Thats very normal teething behavior. You can try baby orajel (didnt work for me), tylenol....the best thing that worked for my kids was wetting a rag and putting it in the freezer for about a half hour and letting them chew on it. My kids loved it. You can try teething rings as well. Within a few weeks it should get better, hang in there.|`|X6as2nOAaa	That is normal for teething babies, have you given her hylands teething tablets? Those seem to really work, some people get a wet wash cloth and let their kids chew on that. I hope it gets better for you.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	For some babies, it's just part of growing up-separation anxiety, pain of teething, learning new skills,etc. all these things have got to be tough on a little one.  My first went thru the same thing.  he just cried all. the. time!  But we made it thru with a lot of patience and good routines.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I'm going to the same thing and my son will be 6 months in a few days. Oddly enough the teeth I could see cutting through have disappeared! (I'm guessing it's just swelling) Anyways, are you giving her tylenol or motrin? Motrin is suppose to help with pain better. What about teething rings and orajel? Anything that will offer pain relief should lift her spirits.|`|87WOSjwgaa	Could she maybe be hungry? The only reason I say that is because when my daughter was younger she was super hungry and was really fussy like that. What are you feeding her?|`|lCbsCM6raa	Have you started her on solids? Just a shot in the dark...my daughter was acting like this around 6 months and I was sure it was teething, but then I started solids and she became much happier....|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	Maybe she is bored?  I take a drive every day now so my daughter can look out the window and look at new things.  I often have to leave the house because she is just not stimulated enough.|`|4kfljeIGaa	Babies can indeed be quite grumpy while teething.  From what you've said, it sounds like she is an early teether.  My oldest got her first lower incisor around 8 months, and then within the next four months, went from having zero teeth to eight teeth.  Keep in mind that those little teeth have quite a ways to go before they break the surface of the gum, and all of that can be rather painful.  Don't be surprised if a bunch more teeth erupt very shortly.   <br>  <br>  I recommend Tylenol infant drops, hard plastic toys fresh from the freezer, and yes, even wet washcloths.  You're very fortunate that she has no other illnesses!  Also, if you're nursing, don't be shocked if she goes on a "nursing strike," as the texture of your nipple can exert uncomfortable pressure on her gums.  Try bottles or sippy cups instead.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well i think personally you just need to hang in there. tooth ache is horrendous in some adults and poor babaies have all this pain and no idea whats going on. try different ways to relieve teething tackle problem effectively. cool wash cloth theres  number of gels powders and teething tablets out there. ashtons and parsons powders work a dream for my daughter but others dont just try out some (always read the label though for dose etc) something just might help her out a little|`|I2n0fNFAaa	my 6mo old boy is going through the same exact thing....i've found that alot of times it's that he's overtired even if he hasn't been acting like he's sleepy at all. if i put him down even after a fight he will take a good nap and sleep better at night. also i've found that one of my biggest struggles is the food he eats. i think he like to declare his independence and just fights it...so i started giving him biter biscuits after his meals and he is much happier and more patient. probably just trying to develop his own independence. some develop emotional maturity a little sooner than others. i guess for now it just takes patience and trying to understand what he's going through. he is also starting to crawl. and is also has separation anxiety alot. just a phase, but take heart!
2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. Its normal. Every time I would stress myself out, especially in early pregnancy I would get cramping. and then when I calmed down they would go away.  Its fine, its nothing to worry about. but do try to keep yourself as calm as possible and don't put yourself in stressful situations. Its not good for the baby. good luck.|`|MmP7Kdg7aa	you need to rid yourself of whatever is stressing you out so much. right now since i see you want the pregnancy the best thing you can do for its health is to stay healthy and calm. i lost 4 children before successfully having 2.

You can have a tradition of ending the tradition:-)!  I really wish your names went better together because Richa, Leetha, Tabley, Talia, and Ticha (pronounced Tisha) is all I can come up with. If he does agree to let you name the baby outside the tradition, here are some suggestions:<br>  Aubree<br>  Audrey<br>  Amor<br>  Annasophia<br>  Analyn<br>  Graceland<br>  Faylen<br>  Rhiannon<br>  Rhiannalyn<br>  Melrose<br>  Danity<br>  Heather<br>  Savannah<br>  Peyton<br>  Elizabeth<br>  Nicolette<br>  Nadia<br>  Zania<br>  Ashlyn<br>  Brenlyn<br>  Jemma<br>  Willow<br>  Teegan<br>  Tristan<br>  Logan<br>  Kiara<br>  Victoria<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and good luck with the baby!<br>  <br>  Always,<br>  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|ZX2so3twaa	it's you and your fiance's baby, not his family's.<br>  if you don't wanna continue that tradition then don't.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I think Taley is really cute.|`|AA10766729	Someone's going to have to give, and frankly if you two are going to fight this badly over a baby name, maybe it's time for some marital counseling.<br>  <br>  You could always make a deal with him:  You name the girl(s) he names the boy(s).  And his family should stay the hell out of YOUR life.<br>  <br>  Remind him too that it's the MOTHER who fills out the birth regiastration so he should not push too hard or you'll write what ever the hell you please on it, and he can go pound sand!<br>  <br>  PS - I very much like Amelia.|`|JV0i77uiaa	What about Kayley.  I really don't believe in those tradition.  They named me with the owfull name because of those tradition and ended up changing.  What about Tailene or Tayleen.

Using Taley as her middle name is definitely a start towards compromising. I would suggest sitting down and talking about it, and trying to make both parties happy.

Your baby will be a mix of the two of you anyway without adding any further emphasis.  I think you child will appreciate having a name that gives her her own identity apart from you two.  Taley, however is not bad at all.  It wouldn't be obvious that you had mixed the two names before you told me and I do like Taley.  So if you love this man and he cannot let this go I think that is a good compromise.  It is important that you honor each other's wishes.  Another stab at a not obviously mixed name is Leta or Aleta.   Leta means gladly and Aleta means footloose!|`|8ldMwflKaa	Well, Amelia Taley Jane is very cute.<br>  But, if that doesn't work out, here's some advice:<br>  most of the time, people who have a set name for their baby change their minds once they see the baby.<br>  Once you see the baby, a name just sort of clicks. <br>  She might just look like an Amelia when she's born, or a Taley, or something else.|`|0mZfOStiaa	Oh, this is a toughie.<br>  I understand tradition, but maybe try out your middle names!

I would go see a doctor to be sure and make sure you are doing ok and it's not something else but I'm sure it's just stress.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Well, it is possible that you may be pregnant, but its just not showing up positive yet on the pregnancy test. For some women it may take a while before a test will read positive. I would go in to the doctor and have them do a blood test. That should be pretty accurate then. or just wait another couple weeks and test again. Also, if it turns out your not pregnant, don't worry. Two months is not that long a time to have been trying. It is perfectly normal for it to possibly take up to a year for a healthy couple to conceive a child. Just be patient. good luck.|`|afAbSq5gaa	it could be that u are pregnant and that u are not yet producing enough of the hcg hormone yet to be detected by the test, this happens to a lot women, test again in about a week at which time the levels should be up and if u are pregnant it will be positive, or go to the doctors for a blood test which is 100 % accurate!|`|VXSjZQc3aa	you can only get preggo when your ovulating. but if you've been doing it that was im pretty sure you've done it and theres high chance you are keep taking tests i know someone who didnt find out she was preggo till she was 6months along. good luck|`|ir0qEV3waa	sometimes hpt doesnt detect pregnancy untill later on. most hpt sense 25miu. if you are pregnant keep doin a test every week as ur miu may not be high enough :)

AA12300309	You may want to contact a lactation consultant or your local La Leche League. They can give you the best advice. Good Luck|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Definitely speak to a consultant.<br>  <br>  And don't ever assume you have low milk just because you can't pump much. I never pumped more than half an ounce at a time ever - but I exclusively breastfed my daughter for 6 months. Babies are far more efficient than pumps are.|`|0wTzlG2haa	My first piece of advice is that if you haven't worked with a lactation consultant do that now. She will hopefully be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  My twins weren't early, but they didn't latch well either. It was frustrating but I ended up pumping for 10 full months. THey got about half of their nutrition from breast milk and half from formula. I didn't particularly like doing that....but it was the best thing for my family.<br>  <br>  Here is the reality....you aren't a failure; not by a long shot. You are doing what you can but sometimes it just doesn't work. Yes, breast milk is best....but I've known plenty of babies who have gotten all or some of their feedings in the form of formula who are perfectly happy and healthy children. <br>  <br>  Do what is best for you, your baby and your family. Supplement with formula while you work to get your supply up and while she learns to latch better.|`|wphLaVs6aa	First, you are not a failure. You're obviously trying very hard.<br>  <br>  Definitely contact a La Leche League leader in your area or go to a meeting asap. They should be able to give you immediate tips and tricks to set you and your daughter on the right course. I also recommend posting a detailed description of your problem on the forum on www.kellymom.com. There are some incredibly helpful moderators who can give you some advice right away. Check out the newborn section of the forum.<br>  <br>  I'm wondering if you're pumping between feeds and considering your milk supply as low because of what you're pumping then. If so, between feed pumps won't give you an accurate measure of your supply. <br>  <br>  It's totally worth trying to make this work! The first weeks are hard, but the benefits to your baby are enormous.|`|X6as2nOAaa	You are doing nothing wrong sometimes it is really hard, my advice to you was be as calm as you can with the baby and another thing to do is to feed the baby not on your breast but by bottle until you think they are content so they are full but not too full they could still eat a little bit more, so then after that put the baby on your breast so the baby is not frustrated or anything and it should be a little easier.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I tried to breastfeed too but couldnt produce milk either. I felt like the worst mom in the whole entire world when I switched her to formula. But you know what it was the best thing I could do for her. She was a happier baby and we had a much better relationship for it! Dont worry about what anybody else thinks. Go with your mommy instincts and what works best for you guys! I know that is hard to trust sometimes but I waited 6 weeks to listen to mine. I wish I would have earlier. Congrats on your daughter! You are going to be a great mommy!|`|3NyM1cq5aa	I know exactly how you feel!  I saw a lactation consultant (a lot of time insurance will cover it, or sometimes you can see one for a reduced fee at the hospital where you delivered) and she helped tremendously.  La Leche League is free and they are supposed to be great as well.  My LC told me that babies born early can be lazy at the breast.  Try to keep your baby eating and not let her doze off.  Tickle her feet, take her clothes off so she isn't so warm and comfy, reposition her, etc.  I had to pump after every feeding for quite awhile.  I also took Reglan (prescription) and Mother's Love More Milk Special Blend (over-the-counter).  Those supplements helped A LOT!  There is also a supplemental nurser that gives the baby more milk as she nurses.  It encourages her to eat without giving her a bottle.<br>  I was so frustrated but wanted so badly to breastfeed.  If I thought about keeping it up for a year, it was so daunting, that I would tell myself "I'm going to breastfeed for one more week."  Now it's been over 5 months and my son and I are both great at it!<br>  No one tells you how hard breastfeeding can be.  You don't know what you are doing and neither does your baby!  It took about 6 weeks before I felt like we really had the hang of it.<br>  Try to keep at it, if it is important to you.  I promise, it does get easier!  If you decide not to continue, don't beat yourself up.  Three weeks of breastfeeding is still great.  But if you do keep trying, I really think in a few more weeks you will look back and see how far you've come.<br>  GOOD LUCK and CONGRATS!|`|SQLcWqJAaa	Have you tried using a nipple shield. I used it for 4 1/2 mos with my first son and am using it again for my second boy who is 3mos old.  You can get it at Babies R Us and it's only like 5 or 6 bucks. Try visiting your lactation consultant she may be able to give you more advice. <br>  <br>  Also, babies at this age usually only take maybe 2oz, and typically the baby is able to nurse about an oz more out of you than a pump can. I hope it gets better, hang in there!|`|nKXTjqQWaa	My advice would be to go to a LC. They will be your best bet. For some mothers and babies the whole breastfeeding thing just comes natural for both and it works will little to no effort required. I was lucky that way.

Just have faith in yourself!!|`|qNIa0s2Jaa	PLEASE please please contact a lactaction consultant. If you don't know where to find one, contact the hospital and they can get you in touch with one (usually on staff at most hospitals). I prepared as much as possible, read every book on earth, and assumed breastfeeding would come perfectly naturally to me and my baby. WRONG! It was so hard at first! It took two weeks WITH the lactation consultant to get it down, and then another couple of weeks before I would call it "easy." It was the best thing I ever did. We are conditioned in our society to think that if we try breastfeeding and it's hard, that "it's just not working for me," and immediately switch to formula. If our mothers would have thought that a couple of hundred years ago, none of us would have made it! There are some rare, RARE, conditions when women do not produce enough milk, but this is not what is going on for the vast majority of women trying to breastfeed. Most women think that their babies are not getting enough milk, especially at first, and especially when they don't get a lot of milk out by pumping. Keep in mind that your body produces different amounts and types of milk depending on the time of day and how  much baby is sucking. No pump is as efficient as a baby's mouth, once he or she is taught how to latch on well. Again, it often takes a lactation consultant to help with this process early on. If it's the cost that is stopping you, think again. An appointment with the lactation consultant might cost almost 100 dollars, but sometimes it's free from your hospital. If it works, you just saved at least 100$ per month for the next year for not having to buy formula. If it doesn't improve, consider it one more month of formula cost. Good luck to you and please don't feel like you are alone. It was hard for most of us at first!

Can your partner take a turn at night?|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Up every three hours is completely normal at a month old. <br>  <br>  About all you can do is be sure to keep night time quiet and boring and daytime bright and exciting, so while he will wake up at night to be fed, he should stop expecting to be changed and played with. Just feed him quietly in the dark (leave a dim light on all the time rather than turning one on and off) and lay him back down as soon as he's finished feeding. Don't even burp him unless he's one who absolutely needs it.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Swaddling the baby worked better for me.

Nightwaking has survival benefits. In the first few months, babies' needs are the highest, but their ability to communicate their needs is the lowest. Suppose a baby slept deeply most of the night. Some basic needs would go unfulfilled. Tiny babies have tiny tummies, and mother's milk is digested very rapidly. If a baby's stimulus for hunger could not easily arouse her, this would not be good for baby's survival. If baby's nose was stuffed and she could not breathe, or was cold and needed warmth, and her sleep state was so deep that she could not communicate her needs, her survival would be jeopardized.<br>  <br>  One thing we have learned during our years in pediatrics is that babies do what they do because they're designed that way. In the case of infant sleep, research suggests that active sleep protects babies. Suppose your baby sleeps like an adult, meaning predominantly deep sleep. Sounds wonderful! For you, perhaps, but not for baby. Suppose baby had a need for warmth, food, or even unobstructed air, but because he was sleeping so deeply he couldn't arouse to recognize and act on these needs. Baby's well being could be threatened. It appears that babies come wired with sleep patterns that enable them to awaken in response to circumstances that threaten their well being. We believe, and research supports, that frequent stages of active (REM) sleep serve the best physiologic interest of babies during the early months, when their well being is most threatened. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  6. Nightwaking has developmental benefits. Sleep researchers believe that babies sleep "smarter" than adults do. They theorize that light sleep helps the brain develop because the brain doesn't rest during REM sleep. In fact, blood flow to the brain nearly doubles during REM sleep. (This increased blood flow is particularly evident in the area of the brain that automatically controls breathing.) During REM sleep the body increases its manufacture of certain nerve proteins, the building blocks of the brain. Learning is also thought to occur during the active stage of sleep. The brain may use this time to process information acquired while awake, storing what is beneficial to the individual and discarding what is not. Some sleep researchers believe that REM sleeps acts to auto-stimulate the developing brain, providing beneficial imagery that promotes mental development. During the light sleep stage, the higher centers of the brain keep operating, yet during deep sleep these higher brain centers shut off and the baby functions on her lower brain centers. It is possible that during this stage of rapid brain growth (babies' brains grow to nearly seventy percent of adult volume during the first two years) the brain needs to continue functioning during sleep in order to develop. It is interesting to note that premature babies spend even more of their sleep time (approximately 90 percent) in REM sleep, perhaps to accelerate their brain growth. As you can see, the period of life when humans sleep the most and the brain is developing the most rapidly is also the time when they have the most active sleep. One day as I was explaining the theory that light sleep helps babies' brains develop, a tired mother of a wakeful infant chuckled and said, "If that's true, my baby's going to be very smart." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.workandpump.com/reversecycling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.workandpump.com/reversecyclin...</a><br>  You get better rest: Wait a minute, I just said your baby would wake up more, that you would wake up more - how does this make for better rest?<br>  <br>  The secret is that you and your baby get into similar sleep cycles. When your baby is in a separate room, he wakes up on his sleep cycles, you're on yours, and there's no coordination - so he might be waking up when you're in your deepest sleep (when it's a lot harder to wake up and harder to fall back asleep).<br>  <br>  Also, if your baby is in another room, he has to wake up all the way and start crying before you hear him. You have to wake all the way up and get out of bed, and most likely you sit up in a chair to feed - awake the whole time. Then what? It's 2am, and you're both awake, taking longer for both of you to settle back to sleep.<br>  <br>  If your baby is near you, you'll wake up when he makes his first noises, little half-sleeping grunts. You just reach over to feed, you can nurse lying down, the whole feeding routine is less disruptive to you and your baby's sleep. Falling back to sleep means either sliding your baby back to the co-sleeper, or just drifting off where you are.<br>  <br>  A lot of mothers worry that sleeping in the same bed with their baby is dangerous - but the scientific evidence points to just the opposite conclusion. For breastfeeding, sober mothers who share sleep with their babies on a safe sleeping surface, SIDS rates are amazingly low and babies are healthier. More information about safe co-sleeping can be found in several locations - I found a nice article here. Dr. James McKenna has done extensive research on the safety of co-sleeping - link to his journal articles here. Dr. Jay Gordon also has information about safe co-sleeping. And even more information here. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000...</a><br>  Mothers sleep better<br>  Many mothers and infants are able to achieve nighttime harmony: babies and mothers get their sleep cycles in sync with one another.<br>  <br>      Martha notes: "I would automatically awaken seconds before my baby would. When the baby started to squirm, I would lay on a comforting hand and she would drift back to sleep. Sometimes I did this automatically and I didn't even wake up."<br>  <br>  Contrast sleepsharing with the crib and nursery scene. The separate sleeper awakens – alone and behind bars. He is out of touch. He first squirms and whimpers. Still out of touch. Separation anxiety sets in, baby becomes scared, and the cry escalates into an all-out wail or plea for help. This piercing cry awakens even the most long distance mother, who jumps up (sometimes out of the state of deep sleep, which is what leads to most nighttime exhaustion), and staggers reluctantly down the hall. By the time mother reaches the baby, baby is wide awake and upset, mother is wide awake and upset, and the comforting that follows becomes a reluctant duty rather than an automatic nurturant response. It takes longer to resettle an upset solo sleeper than it does a half-asleep baby who is sleeping within arm's reach of mother. Once baby does fall asleep, mother is still wide-awake and too upset to resettle easily. If, however, the baby is sleeping next to mother and they have their sleep cycles in sync, most mothers and babies can quickly resettle without either member of the sleepsharing pair fully awakening. Being awakened suddenly and completely from a state of deep sleep to attend to a hungry or frightened baby is what leads to sleep-deprived parents and fearful babies.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	He's up every three hours??

You can also try a pacifier (if he will take one), white noise, and swaddling to help him sleep better. But, at this age, it is unusual for baby to sleep more than 4-5 hours at a time, even during the night. Be patient - that will improve soon.<br>  <br>  And he really does still need to eat at least twice during the night because of his tiny tummy! The good news is that he is now old enough to take a  bottle w/o too many worries about nipple confusion.  If you are able, pump some milk (assuming you are BFing) and have daddy give at least one night feeding. It worked very well for us to have me go to bed early and have daddy give the first night feeding - this way I was able to sleep about 6 hours (!) before getting up the first time, and 3 more hours before getting up for the day.|`|3fYRi1y4aa	He will sleep thru the night when hes ready.

kZT828wJaa	Spanking is not a healthy option, not a wise option, and it shows a lack of any parenting skill or knowledge.<br>  <br>  That said, if you are absolutely insistent on spanking your kids, never use an object (anything that leaves a mark is automatically illegal and most implements will).<br>  <br>  The rule about clothing is simple. Is your child/children at an age where they are fully potty trained and bath/shower on their own? If they are no longer at an age where you regularly would happen on them naked without them caring, then it is obviously no longer appropriate, as privacy has become an issue, and thus it is essentially sexual abuse and/or humiliation (especially if they are of the opposite sex from you) though either way it is really and trully inappropriate.<br>  <br>  Some will advocate it particularly on these grounds that (sexual) humiliation is a positive thing in that it is more likely to bother the children, but these folks are in the same category as those who say beating the children harder will be more effective, they are common criminals, unfit parents, and a sure sign that their up-bringing negative impacted their character.|`|9DpbUdKcaa	I found that spanking works but I have not done bare butt.

When I give my son a little spanken on the but with my hand...i have to go to my room and cry. :[ I hate it. Then i become tough lol and we talk about why i spanked him. It works really! :]|`|jAOkIALdaa	it is<br>  but it is also mean and it hurts a loooot<br>  and some people consider abuse<br>  <br>  i was never hit<br>  just put in the bathroom for timeouts where there no toys or no excuse to get out. and a lot of yelling.|`|9F0iuuMYaa	Don't ever spank your kids too hard, but enough to make them learn their lesson .|`|H9t63i4Kaa	It worked for me!!! Spare the rod spoil the child....|`|U5KIOutnaa	no|`|SctVGkaHaa	Often having a stern talkin to, or lecture isn't enough. Some kids definately need a firm hand. Bare butt spankin is a good way to show your child that you mean buisness. Simply smacking a youngin on the butt through their jeans or diaper (depending on age of child) isn't nearly enough. They will look at the situation as if they can get away with what they want. Laydown the law & put your punishment into action.|`|PJBjllsVaa	no. i mean it's one thing to give a kid a tap on the butt but to make a child pull down their pants and hit them (with hands or an object) seems Absolutely absurd to me. and i think it only makes the kid more resentful of the punishment which in turn causes them to act out more.|`|lVa2zYrlaa	I have spank my kids and i think as long as its when they need it. I dont Beat or commit child abuse. I love my kids ..i think some parents should spank their kids sometimes. If they did, then will wont have so many damn teenage violence, gangs.|`|8MmmvRlVaa	that is soooo wrong! a spanking already hurts enough WITH pants on, plus that would be so embaressing.|`|oDlDrjF1aa	theres no problem with spanking|`|yYOh0DUjaa	No, talking is a better way to resolve problems.|`|HWOduCONaa	spanking is what adults with no parenting skills have to do
wi6mkT30aa	Spanking a child is heartless. I mean this is your own child, a child you love, care and respect... right? Well obviously not if you hit them or mistreat them. Spanking sounds like a cheap simple way out. It's not true parenting or punishment.<br>  <br>  A true loving parent would punish their child by sending them to time out. As soon as a child does something bad they need to have a chair in their room or hallway that they can go to and sit their for 10 or so minutes. After that call them over to you and TALK to them. Ask them why they did such a thing? Tell them that it's a no no and let them explain to you what they did wrong. Hug them and then send them on their way. <br>  <br>  Whats the point of picking your CHILD up and hitting them? That's not just disgusting its heartless if you ask me.<br>  <br>  A parent is suppose to love. Showing them love raises them right. Spanking them raises them to know how to hit. Which is just wrong. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Have you ever noticed that the parents who are more meaner and stricker on their child are more WILD and Crazy!<br>  <br>  Children who have strict parents are wild, party, smoke, drink and so much more! Have sex at a young age. As children who are raised RIGHT think more about their actions, not only do they think about that but they think about how their parents would feel if they did something wrong and then they try not to do it. <br>  <br>  Its so much more clear, I wish others understood this more. I don't get why people have children if they don't know how to handle them. Its sick to me!<br>  <br>  I pray for all the poor children out there that are abused. God be with them all.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	As  soon as you made the decision to hide the fact that matches were being played (your suggestion to open the windows) with you became just as guilty or accountable as everyone else regardless of the amount of time you were there.<br>  <br>  Every parent has their system of punishment for what ever misbehavior you get yourself into.  Some believe in spankings some don't (I personally but I believe in it).<br>  <br>  But regardless of the punishment you got I bet you wont be making that mistake again!|`|AA10622097	I would have spanked you, too, just because you were there. A punishment is supposed to make you think about what you did or did not do.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	You shouldn't have, your mother spanked the both of you out of sheer anger. She seriously needs to learn how to control herself. And don't you think she should have been happy that the 3 of you were OK and fine, instead of spanking the daylights out of you? She needs counseling for her anger problem.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	You're not a tattle tale for stopping something DANGEROUS, like playing with matches.  What if there was dried GAS on the floor of the garage from a leak in the car?  What if something had caught fire and it reached the "cans of stuff?"<br>  <br>  Punishment earned.|`|27jdKozNaa	No you deserved it & I think you deserve even stricter disiplinary action(s) if you're actually writing this thinking you are in no way wrong...grow up|`|LNnRSLdtaa	ok i was on your side untill you said you helped them hide it<br>   thats where you where wrong <br>  <br>  they were lighting paper on fire in the house<br>  do you know how easily fire spreads?<br>  you sound very naive|`|INlDPJMVaa	well i probably wouldn't have spanked you, cuz i don't like physical punishments, but i would have asked you about it. Only because i would have assumed that you were also playing with the matches. But i would have given you a chance to explain first. So then, I wouldn't punish you if you told me that you had just walked in and seen that, and didn't have a chance to do anything. So, i think that your mom was wrong.|`|9ufltMBtaa	that is so stupid. I can't be live it! you were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. spanking is for  parents that don't know how to discipline there children. I see spankings as child abuse. I would be sooo made at your mom if i were you.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I don't believe in spanking, but I do think it's very stupid of you to be playing with matches. I'd just not let you hang out with your friends until you can show some better judgement.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I probably would have spanked you too and then explained why that is so dangerous and what you should have done. Then you would have been sent to your room.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would have done the same. your old enoughto know this behaviour is irresponsible and very dangerous, so you should have said something..|`|a6e7SRYzaa	You are old enough to know better. Your mom was write you should have left. I would have done the same thing as you mom|`|A9j7ahwsaa	instead of being concerned about the punishment being fair perhaps you should think of this.. what if the paper had caught, fire but got bigger than you thought it would? what if you friends clothes had caught fire, you know, fire needs air to breathe, you said to open the window, that could have fanned the flames and you all could have been burnt to death. then it would have been your fault! you are all lucky that your mothers turned up when the did, being burnt hurts worse than any punishment. be thankful your mum cares!|`|qWNVHEsJaa	Her punishment was correct because it will make you think twice next time this situation occurs.  You knew it was wrong.. you should have trusted your gut feelings.  Spanking is not meant to hurt you, but to get your attention and help you realize there are consequences to your actions.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	I thought the older one (12) threw the remote at her younger sisters head (10) when you were over at their house, and she got spanked and the younger didn't? I think this mother has a problem, or possibly, you have a fetish for spankings?|`|RgxriB7jaa	I have at least one question for you. After your punishment- were you given an opportunity to explain yourself? (In a sensible manner.)<br>  <br>  However, from the perspective of a concerned parent, I think I would be scared if the fire could get out of control. Most parents would be concerned for their child's' lives- often anger clouds fear. I will admit that once when I was younger, I have done reckless things involving fire... having scared my parents was enough.<br>  <br>  I believe that punishing you might have been fair also because when you do get older- you can get in trouble just by being around trouble- as a lesson to take with you. Regardless of your part in it.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  One would not completely understand the perspective of a parent unless one becomes one themselves.<br>  <br>  Albeit, I am not a fan of the use of corporal punishment (spanking, for instance) for a handful of reasons. One, some kinds of kids don't think it's 'enough' to make them change their behavior... while some will stop doing something the instant of punishment.<br>  <br>  The main idea of any punishment is to make you not do something, as you are likely to know. And its basis is in highly traditional parenting.
7Jt0kLV4aa	It isn't necessarily pregnancy.  If you are on birth control it could be that you are on too strong a dosage.  If you switch brands or lower dosage you should be fine.  It could also be morning sickness.|`|AA11510511	Morning sickness.  It could be a sign of pregnancy.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	There are a number of reasons that you are vomiting every morning.  As some have suggested you could be pregnant.  If its not pregnancy you could have a thyroid problem (I threw up everyday before I started taking medication for this) or it could be a number of other medical reasons.  I recommend taking a pregnancy test and then going to the doctors.  If your not pregnant they will do a number of tests to determine what is wrong.|`|ycdkngxlaa	There could be a number of reason why you are vomiting only in the morning, not necessarily pregnancy as it is very rare that a pregnant person only vomits in the morning, it could be contraceptives or medication you are taking orsomething. Take a trip to the doctor and explain to them what is going on they should be able to tell you more.|`|uFlrbRbXaa	you might have swallowed some spiders or other insects while you were sleeping and your body is rejecting them.|`|AA12030056	morning sickness|`|iuoB7pf0aa	Pregnant? <br>  <br>  Please do not get an abortion.|`|B6ArCTQjaa	This is a symptom of pregnancy. morning sickness|`|jAVLJOZAaa	morning sickness|`|HP1hHcojaa	Sounds like Morning Sickness. You could be pregnant|`|XnxWsTFpaa	because you're preggers.. talk to your parents x
DQ8WR6CXaa	possibly. Average successful pregnancy rate =20%<br>  Which means women are sometimes pregnant and don't even know it. The body naturally discards if there is any sort of genetic defect. They also happen spontaneously. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, but be more responsible next time, unless you're trying.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You should probably see a doctor BUT if you think you were pregnant since August you would have known if you were pregnant.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Sounds very possible.  Since it sounds like maybe you were I wouldn't assume miscarriage.  I'd still see a doctor.  My cousin had a "period" all of a sudden and it turns out it wasn't a miscarriage but a cysts and the baby was fine.  Just in case I'd see a doctor since things seem to have been irregular for you.|`|4LSu2x12aa	I had a miscarriage back in november, it is quite possible that you at one point were and maybe still are pregnant. I would go to my doctor or E.R immediately. because if you are having a miscarriage you need to make sure it all comes out otherwise you can get a pretty nasty infection and its not worth the risk of never being able to have children, also unleft tissue can turn cancerous if not removed.  So for your sake mentally and physically GO to the docs... <br>  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck and if it is a miscarriage just remember god has a plan for us all!|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I don't think so. I would say that if you ever were than you still are and I highly doubt that you wouldn't be able to tell by now. You would be way to far along now to have a miscarriage. You would have to give birth to a baby and it would be considered a stillbirth.|`|afAbSq5gaa	I think that it is entirly possible though i am no doctor, i would suggest going to your doctor because when someone does have a miscarriage an ultrasound is needed to make sure it all came out otherwise it could make u sick.|`|480c8670c97d5544350aa8b11691f73caa	you can go to the doctors and they can do a blood test to see if the pregnancy hormones are still in your body. You would have to go back a few times over a few weeks time to see if the go down... this is if you were pregnant in the last month or so
WXExyAlWaa	It doesn't much matter how long he hasn't had sex for, if you have unprotected sex there is always a chance.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If he ejaculated previously in the day and not urinated between then and sex it's possible. It doesn't matter how long the guy has gone without sex. Virgins can get pregnant the first time they have sex....Use a condom.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	How long he's been "holding it" doesn't matter...LOL.  But if you have unprotected sex of course their is a possibility there.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	it doesnt matter how long it`s been since u had sex it only takes once.and u can get pregnant from pre *** just as good as him cumming all in you.been there done that now 28 weeks pregnant with a lil boy.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	It depends on where you are in your cycle. You could definitely be pregnant. It has nothing to do with how long it's been since his last sexual encounter. Get a pregnancy test asap.|`|p3d3E75oaa	very good any time 2 people have un safe sex its a pregnancy risk|`|8shR5rCcaa	u are at risk of getting pregnant any time you ave unprotected sex.  Pre *** is actually more potent them full ejaculation only because there are more sprem in the precum than the full thing.  think twice before you use the pullout method. more young girls (and older women too) are unaware that they get pregnant off the pullout method than any ther method.  the one way to make sure you dont get pregnant if u dont wat kids anyway, is be abstinant or be safe.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The possibilities are there. Pre ejaculate fluid contains sperm too.  And it doesn't matter how long it's been since he last had sex either..<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PJBjllsVaa	your chances of getting pregnant are very good.<br>  it doesn't matter that he hasn't had sex in three years<br>  pre ejaculation CAN get you pregnant|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	the same as whether he has sex 2 days ago. Your chances are high if your ovulating at that time.|`|AA11540024	it only takes that one time to get pregnant|`|bXQippbhaa	very high! BTW- how old r u????????
qamxVrV5aa	yes it is ok. During pregnancy you will get different due dates but the most accurate will be the one from your ultrasound.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	if they are doubleing every 2-3 days then its fine|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Yes...your due date changes often through pregnancy.  The doctor narrows it down by your ultrasound and you'll go by that as opposed to your LMP.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! most drs do NOT determine the your gestational age by the b-HCG because all women are not the same and it is not an exact science. I had a b-HCG of 3000 @ only 4 weeks. Some people @ 4 weeks are at only 25 so it just depends on the women! Neways try not to worry! ALSO-if you go for your ultrasound and its showing earlier than you thought you may have ovulated later in your cycle. GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!! <3<3|`|p3d3E75oaa	your due  will continue to change depending on when you actually conceived but the ultra sound is normally what they go by this early along congrats
uFrqC4Y2aa	I got pregnant soon after getting off BC pills but I bled a little here and there before I became pregnant. It takes a while for your body to get ajusted. Good luck!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Spotting can be a early pregnancy sign, however it seems to be too early to be implantation, I would say it is due to ovulation, or coming off the pill.  You are most likley mid cycle, spotting during ovualtion is a excellent fertility sign, I would get to it!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|KoGWO5tkaa	HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GETTING **** IN A DAY?<br>  <br>  TRY DIFFERENT MEN :)
tcHkn0VIaa	many women are in the first stage of labor for weeks before they go into active labor but you should still call your dr. and tell them that you are having contractions and how far apart they are|`|zSABr7praa	Babies can survive these days as early as 15 weeks premature.  It would be a rough start for the little one, but he would be just fine after a few weeks :)|`|p3d3E75oaa	Im going through the same thing except Im 34 weeks and yeah the baby should be fine I had all my children before 33 weeks and they are all here and healthy, I really cant believe I made it this far along congrats and good luck|`|cie3oBcXaa	Both my two were born that early. I had the steroids to develop their lungs and everything worked out ok. They are 10 and 14 now and fit and healthy. Good luck :)|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	He should do ok coming at 33 weeks. He will have to stay in the hospital for a while though if he were to come early.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Babies born after 30 weeks have a high survival rate.  33 weeks is even better.  Good luck!
uFrqC4Y2aa	YES! You are pregnant!|`|256cVXsmaa	yep there are no false positives.  only false negatives.<br>  CONGRATS =D|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are pregnant. See a doctor ASAP.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yes or at least you were, you see you got positives, then had a bleed, then got a negative, doesn't sound to good if im honest, go and buy another test (the ones you took which came out positive) and see what result you get, then go and see a doctor|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes, see your obgyn soon!<br>  <br>  start prenatal vitamins|`|p3d3E75oaa	yes you still could be but go see your doctor and see what he comes up with good luck|`|Xs0fhFJnaa	You can get false negatives but not false positives. The brand that came up negative was probably less sensitive than the other ones. Sounds like your bleeding was implantation bleeding - but see your doctor, as any unusual bleeding or discharge in pregnancy should be investigated.<br>  <br>  Congratulations mummy!|`|sAbah6dTaa	I WOULD SAY DEFINATELY SO, ONLY FALSE NEGATIVES NO FALSE POSITIVES, BUT I WOULD CALL YOUR DOCTOR TO CONFIRM IT.<br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS!|`|afAbSq5gaa	There is a very good chance that u are pregnant, false positives are rare ( usually only see false negatives)<br>  <br>  I would say u are pregnant!!|`|PfIywLLyaa	yes! You will not get false positives but will get false negatives. You can spot or bleed even though you are pregnant. Go see a doctor to make certain.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I would make an appointment to have a pregnancy test done at your OBGYN's office..<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	You are definitely pregnant! ? ? ? ?|`|GEfpzUNvaa	i would say yes you are.. congrats and send baby dust to the rest of us ttc'ers...|`|7IHMjy2caa	Yes you could be. Go to the doctor to be sure.|`|ZBEqKrsraa	Sweetie you need to call your dr. You are more than likely pregnant I mean 4 out of 5 I would say YES...You can have false negatives...you may have note done it right....and tons of woman have their period during pregnancy and some woman may spot as well...So call your dr. and Congrats!|`|8shR5rCcaa	no such thing as a false positive see your dr right away.  you are pregnant.  if you are bleeding and get a neg, the bleeding may have been caused be the inplantation of the egg.  congrats.  wish ou the best of luck,  keep us posted|`|VXSjZQc3aa	you've got 4 out of 5 that would be good enough for anyone and most people stop at three and just because one said no doesnt mean the other three were lieing. if you still dont think your preggo get a blood test ... they dont lie.|`|hsp7f9Epaa	yes you can if you have taken 5 and four of them was positive and just 1 was negative I would go to the doctors to make sure|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Yes, you are pregnant.  HPT do not give false positives, only false negatives.  Go to your doctor and get a pregnancy serum and HCG test done to see how far you are.  Congrats.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	Take another test and go see your dr. you might have had a very early miscarriage which is why i say to take another test because if the next one is negative than that is more than likely what happened. Sorry|`|Qki6UtFSaa	you're pregnant. congrats! the light bleeding was probably implantation bleeding.|`|tgzGcu5uaa	4/5 is almost positive, and you can hardly get a false positive- so I'm betting you are. Good luck!|`|NUmeIxyfaa	Sounds like it!! Congratulations MOM|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	4 out of 5 say yes!!|`|IQP0mIMmaa	4 out of 5 means a defoo yes|`|P4napZN5aa	its very likely that you are, consult your GP.

TEG6O7sDaa	My mom had a baby when she was 45 too. I was only 11 at the time (which was 14 years ago!!), and man was it a suprise! They are treated like a high risk pregnancy, but otherwise they seem to do just fine. I would say you need to help her to keep her stress levels down, try helping her to relax- maybe even some pregnancy massages a little later on would be good for her. Try to help around the house, don't give her a hard time and be happy for her!! She needs to make sure she follows all doctors orders as far as if she is to be put on bed rest and what her limitations on things are. My moms had a regular labor and delivery and both mom and baby were healthy afterwards. Good Luck and I'm sure she'll be alright, just take care of her!!|`|mjd1EtDWaa	One of my friends (moms friends But she is mine too) Just had a baby and she is 44... She had a tough time but the baby was worth it...<br>  <br>  Make sure she has a gooood doctor and regular checkups... like anyone should (especcailly when preggo)<br>  <br>  Here are some websites to check out!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.musckids.com/health_library/hrpregnant/over30.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.musckids.com/health_library/h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://socalfertility.com/age-and-fertility.html" rel="nofollow">http://socalfertility.com/age-and-fertil...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  On ivillage there is a board for "Pregnant after 40" might wanna check that out!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	My best advise is for her to go to a midwife.  She will be classified as "high risk" in a hospital and they will do many unnecessary tests on her and possible try to induce her or do a planned C section.  If she is healthy there is no reason for any of that and it will cause her stress.  A midwife will give her the best experience possible and will be there as a friend as well as maternity care giver throughout.  It's safer for her and there is a huge differece|`|XeO7XdQhaa	I'm sorry, but you just can't tell someone to tell their mother what to do.<br>  <br>  Support is the main thing.
vOFdHvlvaa	My son slept 6 hours straight at night at 2 weeks old, then by 3 weeks old was sleepin 7 hours straight, and during the day he'd eat every 3 hours or so.  By 2 months old he was sleepin 8 hours straight, then by 3 months he was sleepin 9 hours straight, and would eat every 3/1/2 hours or so durin the day.   By 4 months old he was sleepin 10/1/2  hours straight and would eat every 3 to 4 hours durin the day.  Then at 6 months old and still now at 8/1/2 months old he's been sleepin through 12 full hours at night and has 5 bottles durin the day, about 2 to 3/1/2 hours apart.  Some babies take awhile before they sleep throught the night and others start it early and stay sleepin through the night others who start early may not stay that way lol.  Hope this helps and good luck, :D|`|JT4OSUPeaa	We were just one of the lucky ones. Our son started sleeping through at 3 weeks old. We did nothing special, we gave him a warm bottle right before he fell asleep and he just didn't wake up until the next morning. I kept checking on him but he was fine. Now he goes down about 8:30-ish and wakes around 6:30-7am-ish.|`|DvnOIx1laa	My daughter is six months old this week and still wakes up every three to four hours to feed, however my son slept through the night at six weeks!! good luck|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	My daughter slept through the night for the first time (a 5 hour stretch) at 6.5 months.<br>  Shes 8 months now..and still wakes up once a night (normally after 5 or  6 hours)|`|YlLmAADraa	my son started sleeping through the night at 6 weeks old... started with 6-7 hours now at 11 weeks he does 10 hour nights and im the one who has to wake him up in the morning.|`|yKS2UI87aa	2 days before I had to go back to work :) But I cheated and gave a smidgen of rice cereal to him at his bed time bottle|`|FWUSLQN2aa	after 3-5 months, when i started putting beechnut because it disolves better, not gerber, ceral in heis milk, but you need to wait till he gets a bit bigger or he/she will get constipated, wait until atleast three months, if you breastfeed, cut back on your water intake, it will thicken up the milk, and just give your baby fresh water in his/her bottle on the side. but that should help, and if you dont you'll have to wait till three months unless your doc suggests otherwise. goodluck, and congrats on your little angel.|`|SQLcWqJAaa	It's so hard not to compare babies but I understand your need to know where your little one stands next to all the others. It helps in finding a piece of what is normal.  I have two boys, 2 yrs and 3mos. My 2yr old didn't sleep through the night until he was about 5 mos old. My 3 mos old is starting to go longer stints at night. He'll go from 9ish to 1:30/2 and then from 3-7. Sometimes He'll even skip the 2am feed.|`|AxiUWLtPaa	My son is 2 months old and he's colic so he wears himself out and sleeps 8-9 hours a night. Before he got colic he was sleeping about every 4-5 hours. All I did then was give him a bath with the Johnson's Bed Time Clothes. They are cloth then you just got to get them wet and wash him up. They are Lavender. I would just try that and see if it helps him sleep just a little longer.
Q05rrSX4aa	According to having a 28 day cycle:<br>  <br>  Monday, 9 Feb, 2009 <br>  - Saturday, 14 Feb, 2009 were your fertile days.<br>  <br>  According to having a 29 day cycle:<br>  <br>  Tuesday, 10 Feb, 2009 <br>  - Sunday, 15 Feb, 2009 <br>  <br>  And so on, I am not sure how long your cycles are.  Plus, you may not ovlaute like that, you may go sooner or later in your cycle.  You just never know.  Sounds like you did it around your fertile time.  So your chances are 25-30% (that's the chance every women "trying" has of getting pregnant each month) I know you are not trying, but by having sex on your fertile days.....its pretty much the same thing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|ea6Yk54raa	Very likely your probable day of conception is about the 12th and since he did the deed inside on the 9th and 13th seems to me like is is pretty probable but if you keep a schedule like this one you should expect a little Bundle of joy in the near future! Have fun!!!|`|kIad9ffRaa	Don't let him "pull out". Have him finish "in". Go to WebMD.com They have all kinds of information that can help you with getting pregnant. It was a big help to my wife and I.|`|Y8CH3nVBaa	REGARDLESS IF HE PULLED OUT OR NOT, IN THE PRECUM THERE IS STILL LOTS OF "BABIES" TO FERTILIZE YOUR EGGS.FROM WHAT INFO YOU REPORTED,IT IS VERY MUCH POSSIBLE.SO IN ESSENCE PULLING OUT DOES NOT REALLY HELP YOU ANY BECAUSE A TINY DROP COULD STILL GET YOU PREGNANTAND YOU HAD SEX DURING THE TIME YOU WERE POSSIBLY OVULATING.USUALLY YOU OVULATE THE WEEK BEFORE YOUR PERIOD. IF YOU GET LUCKY THIS TIME AND ARE NOT PREGNANT,GET A HOME OVULATION KIT($7) AND IT GIVES YOU 5 INSIDE.THEN YOU CAN MAKE SURE AND USE A CONDOM TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF A LITTLE ONE.HOPE MY ANSWER HELPS YOU! GOODLUCK!!|`|qRDHEGHJaa	well my first day of my last period ws jan 26th and we found out yest that we are prego feb 22nd  so if you buy a test that tells you 4 days sooner you will know. and please if you guys arent in a real serious realationship dont bring a baby in the world. Sounds to me like YOU are trying to get prego by him other wise you should use protection or get fixed. not acting like an adult making these kind of dessions sounds like a 16 or 17 year old child have sex with his/her  SO...............please think about what could happen if you dont use protection std's a BABY etc|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	You would be ovulating in the week of the 9-13, if you ovulate normaly. You could ovulate later though or even earlier. <br>  <br>  It's really hard to know what your chances are if you haven't been charting.
tcHkn0VIaa	you have to be carefull because the lungs may not be fully developed- especially if there is a possibility that your dates are off.|`|uOp2sdiQaa	unless your baby already has health issues, i don't think so. they may tell you your baby needs to be in the nicu, but its hard to say until they are born. i'm being induced at 37 weeks for my twins.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Mine was born at 36 weeks perfectly healthy. Came home with me and everything he didnt even have to go to NICU. But sometimes even full term babies are born with problems that werent noticed during pregnancy|`|r6IRYVRnaa	It should be good..|`|Ydjk80cJaa	probably not, they are usually pretty developed by then|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	36 weeks is hit or miss.. but 37 is concidered term so most likely a baby born at 36 weeks would be fine
WpGROxH8aa	"Plan B" is not the abortion pill, but there is an abortion pill. <br>  Its called Mifepristone. You have to be less than 8 weeks pregnant to use it. <br>  I don't know if there's anywhere you can get it for free. Try going to Planned Parenthood. They could at least tell you.|`|256cVXsmaa	Unless you are putting it on your parents insurance you will have to pay for it of course.  If you are talking about the actual abortion pill it is really expensive if you aren't using insurance.  I read it was about 800 dollars.<br>  If you are actually talking about plan B which is the pill you take 72 hours after having sex that is about 40-50 dollars.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Ohhh people!!!   THERE IS TOO AN ABORTION PILL!!  It is not the same thing as plan B (AKA The morning after pill.)   Yes you still need to pay for it and you need a doctor to prescribe it to you.  You can't get it over the counter like you can plan B.  You have to be less than 8 weeks or it won't work.  A doctor has to confirm how far along you are.|`|EvRIwz4Laa	first it is not the abortion pill. It will not cause pregnancy termination if the embryo has already implanted. It will only prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine wall. So if you can take are say two weeks pregnant it will not work. Ok, so with that being said if it has been less than 72 hours (three days) since your alternative contraceptive method fails then you can take Plan B. The further away from the 72 hour deadline you are the better % chance that it will work. If you are under the age of 18 you will need to see a doctor to get a prescription for the medication which can be given to you by your family doctor, planned parenthood or a local clinic. If you are 18 or older then you do not need a prescription and you would just go to the pharmacy. Either way you will have to pay for it. Many insurances do not cover Plan B but some do. Without insurance Plan B will cost about $40|`|0SIhrYCbaa	There is no abortion pill for heavens sake. There is a pill that you can take after unprotected sex to keep from getting pregnant. If you are already pregnant there is no magic pill to dispose of the baby. Its a baby at this point and you have it.The only abortion is the kind were you go in and have it sucked from you with a vacuum. And you do have to pay for that too.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Why is it that young girls who mess around think that abortion is birth control.  There is a real baby with a real beating heart and a real brain and real arms, legs and a body that is growing inside you and the first thought that you have for solving your irresponsibility is to kill it.  It would be nice if (even if you can't raise it) you would take some responsibility for your actions and let that baby live.  There are a million people out there who are desperate to adopt who have been having responsible sex for years and can not produce the precious life inside of them that you flippantly chose to make inside of you.  Give that family a child and please don't kill your own.  If you don't believe that it is a living being inside you perhaps watching one of the many videos of abortions being done on an ultrasound that are online, such as "the silent scream".  Please consider the innocent one you created before choosing to end it's life for your mistake.|`|rHufcHwHaa	Are you referring to Plan B?  This doesn't end pregnancy, and you'd still have to pay for it.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about having an abortion, you'd have to pay for that too, and it's likely that you'd have to have parental consent.  You'll have to go to a doctor or to planned parenthood.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	These ppl are stupid FYI its not plan b....I know what your talking about you take a pill and it makes you have an abortion at home and then you have to go back and get a dnc sometimes...I live in wv and yes here you have to pay for it but if you go and get a paper from a dr saying your pregnant and take it the department of human resources you can get a medical card and they will pay for it.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	The abortion pill?<br>  <br>  You can get the Morning After Pill or (Plan B) but you have to take that with in 72 hours of having sex.  You can't just take a pill and think your baby will go away!<br>  <br>  Please, if you are pregnant consider adoption, I know you are young, but do you have any idea how many women out there would love to have a child and can't?!<br>  <br>  First find out if you are pregnant, and then go to a doctor for help.|`|VUKDrd2taa	There IS and abortion pill, its the same price as a surgical abortion,in most state's. But yes you will need to pay for it, i highly doubt those things are covered by insurance.Your age has nothing to do with if you haft to pay for the pill or not. Honestly, if your having to ask these things on here i don't  think you should be having sex.But to each his own i guess.|`|AA10504387	If you need free counseling while you are making your decision (they respect your decision whatever it is): www.yourbackline.org<br>  <br>  There is funding available - either through donations to clinics or low (or no) interest loans for a clinical abortion. Going to a clinic is safer and more effective than attempting self-induced abortion. For funding information in the USA: www.nnaf.org/help.html<br>  <br>  If you are underage in the United States and are looking at self-induced abortion because of fear of parental notification – there are organizations set up to assist you. Contact your local National Organization of Women chapter www.now.org or your local Unitarian Church minister www.uua.org and ask about Operation Overground - a service to help transport and provide accomodation for women who must travel across states to obtain clinical abortion services. When you travel to another state without parental notification laws - you do not need to obtain permission or notification.<br>  <br>  If you are still looking at self-induced abortion, the best information is available in a book called Natural Liberty: Rediscovering Self-Induced Abortion Methods by Sage-femme Collective.

Sometimes it is sold over the counter without a prescription. Sometimes a prescription is asked. It is less likely that one would need a prescription for Arthrotec.<br>  <br>  Misoprostol is used prevents gastric ulcers<br>  '''Cytotec and Cyprostol and Mibetec or Misotrol', Prostokos'' are brand names for Misoprostol.<br>  Arthrotec and Oxaprost contains Misoprostol and a painkiller called Diclofenac, It is used for pain in the joints, or arthritis. Arthrotec is generally more expensive than Cytotec.<br>  <br>  - Cytotec (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Cyprostol<br>  - Misotrol<br>  - Mibetec<br>  - Gymiso (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Prostokos (25μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Vagiprost (25μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Arthrotec 50 or 75 (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  - Oxaprost 50 or 75 (200μg Misoprostol)<br>  <br>  To obtain one these medicines, one could for example say that your grandmother has rheumatoid arthritis so severely she can not go to the pharmacy herself, and that you do not have money to pay for a doctor to get the prescriptions for the tablets.<br>  <br>  If there are problems to get the medicines in one pharmacy, try another pharmacy, or a male friend or partner might have fewer problems obtaining them. Or, perhaps you can find a doctor willing to prescribe them. Usually one can expect more luck at the smaller pharmacies that do not belong to a chain.<br>  <br>  Sometimes Cytotec can also be bought on the black market (places where you can also buy Marijuana). However try to make sure that is really is Misoprostol and not fake or some other medicine!<br>  <br>  The woman should buy at least 12 pills of 200 mcg Misoprostol. One pill of Cytotec or Arthrotec should contain 200 micrograms of Misoprostol. Look for the dosage of Misoprostol on the package, usually the tablets contain 200 mcg but other dosages do excist. If the pills do not contain 200 micrograms of Misoprostol, recalculate the number of pills so that the same total amount of Misoprostol is used.

No you still have to pay for the abortion. Why not instead you learn to use protection, and grow up. On second thought why don't you just stop having sex because you are obviously not mature enough for the responsibility.<br>  Oh and might I add there's not such thing as an abortion pill.|`|3255bf9a56942506a066812fff721579aa	There is an abortion pill- its called a medical abortion.

Well- most of them.  Yes there is an abortion pill.  Here is a link on it!!    And to answer your question- you do still need to pay for it regardless of your age.  I am not sure how much it is but you do have to get it from a doctor.  It is not like plan B, (The morning after pill) that these people are mistaking it for.  Plan B IS NOT an abortion pill and will do nothing to an existing pregnancy, but the abortion pill will.  It has to be taken within the first 8 weeks.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	There IS an abortion pill. RU-80 or something like that, and it is different from Plan B. <br>  <br>  Yes, you do have to pay for it and it usually costs the same as a clinical abortion.

Just like they had to endure their family splitting up, and their mom bringing another man into their lives, and new kids invading their space.  You adults did this to these poor kids, and now you want to dictate every one else's behavior.  Sorry.  It doesn't work that way.  Some things are too broken to ever be fixed.

ytE1q20taa	It's probably nothing to worry about, so don't stress about it because it's just making things worse for your baby if you do.<br>  I had the same thing, my midwife told me that my baby was a bit small for 28 weeks and I got told to go to the hospital and get a scan to check everything was right and it was, it was just because I'm small myself (size 8 and around 5'6"/5'7"), maybe you have the same 'problem'?<br>  But seriously, don't worry about it.<br>  If there was anything to worry about, your midwife would have said there was something to worry about.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Well, my nephew was born at 28 weeks and he only weighed 1lb. 14oz. at birth, and my old bosses son was born at 27 weeks and also weighed under 2 lbs, so I wouldn't think that it's too small, but I'm no doctor. Also the ultrasounds can't perfectly predict size and at 28 weeks I don't see why they are even that concerned. You're baby still has plenty of time to grow. Still, don't worry, I had to have the same monitoring at the end of my first pregnancy because they thought that I was measuring too small. My son was small but not too small. He was 6lbs. 5oz and the doctor said it was just because my placenta was small. Everything was just fine, they were just taking precautions.|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	Don't worry yourself.  Just listen to the dr and know that they gain most of their weight in the last trimester.  The last month they gain about a pound a week, so you shouldn't have to worry about a preemie.  Another thing to remember is that they are guessing the babies weight.  They have no way of actually weighing your baby now.  Don't worry yourself.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	According to my book at 28 weeks the baby could weigh up to 2.5 pounds so i would not worry too much. those sonograms can be quite inaccurate and the baby is showing to be only a few ounces smaller than what is indicated.

oObVYMd3aa	The best advice that I could give you is to try not to but in too much. I know you guys are close but if you keep trying to talk her out of everything she already has her mind set onto she might disgard you as a friend or simply stop telling you so much information. They way things are is really good because at least now anything she is doing she's letting you know. Take it from me I'm a 16 year old girl and if I was telling my bff things i'd normally keep to myself and they kept trying to talk me out of it i'd stop telling them. Tell her how you feel on the situation but just try not to push it so much.|`|oPA99JMvaa	If she doesn't listen to you tell her parents or a teacher, you may feel like a snitch but it is the best thing for her.  If she doesn't change anything tell her you don't want to be friends.  don't waist your time with someone who is wasting their life.<br>  <br>  --Sarah|`|0mVwODmFaa	i know you care about her & are concerned but you have to let her do her own thing & she will have to learn the lesson the hard way.<br>  14 year old girls are hard to tell things to.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	You cant, the best thing you can do is be her friend and be there for her when she gets hurt. until that happens she'll think she knows best|`|dShhCo8yaa	Listen mate, you tried your best and she didn't want to know, I hate to tell you this but she will be texting/ringing/emailing you when she gets pregnant or gets an STD.|`|p0prrzf2aa	if she was "mature" like you said she is, she wouldn't have had sex with a guy shes only known for 3 days. that's DISGUSTING and shes toooooo young to even be having sex.|`|pcjOQDymaa	leave her alone.<br>  she will realize how stupid she is when she gets pregnant or gets an STD!|`|7SCjPftKaa	As the others say, you can advise her but you can't control her. Yes, she shouldn't be having sex at that age and she will probably regret it but it is her decision to make. <br>  <br>  I lost my virginity aged fourteen to a guy I was with for two years until I was sixteen, never been pregnant or had an STD because I used my brain but I still wish I had waited!<br>  <br>  To be honest, it sounds like you're reacting  so strongly because you are jealous of their relationship. Might not be the case but that's how it comes across.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Clearing things up: you are not her father; you cant tell her what to do...But i agree, it's sad that she wants to have sex at such a young age and I admire you for caring...Just keep encouraing her to stop having sex and tell her its not cool to be having sex with someone she's only known for 3 days its not smart and its very dangerous...Now that she is having sex you need to encourage her to keep up with frequent STD tests.I know its hard waching your friend go down a dangerous path but since she is not taking heed to what you have told her, I guess this is a lesson she has to learn on her own!!!! Good luck and wish her the best!!!|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	At least someone has some sense... Do you know if she is on birth control? That's pretty stupid if she isn't although no matter how many methods you use, you can always become pregnant so....warn her.<br>  <br>  Freaking 3 days? She is...pretty sl*tty to tell you the truth.<br>  <br>  There's not much you can do. Just let her kiss her life goodbye cos she could be going down a bad path in my opinion...Good friend you are though.|`|o4lPQjrGaa	As a friend, it's good that you care... but I do not think it is your place to tell her what to do like this. If you are so concerned, get her parents involved. You said what she's doing is against the law so this must mean her boyfriend is over 18 right ? ... So you really need to get her parents involved just because of the simple fact that he is over the legal age.! Honestly, if he was about her age, it wouldn't be okay to have sex, but still reasonable because she is gonna make that decision no matter what you say. If her mom is involved, and they decide that if her daughter is gonna be sexually active then her mom can take care of that like birth control and all that. But really at that age if her mom finds out, she's never gonna wanna have sex again ! heheee.. cause i sure wouldn't if my mom knew!
JmM8xCbLaa	Oh my god!!! Do not even attempt to kill the baby rabbits!!!<br>  What the hell is wrong with you??<br>  Why would you do such a thing!!!<br>  If you don't want the babies, sell them, or give them away!!! <br>  And then get your rabbits neutered/spayed!!!|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Separate them but make sure both have the stuff to make a nest. You will be able to spot the female then by the one making the nest! Or take both to the vet as they ill be able to tell. Also, the female is likely to be much fussier than she was before so try gentle handling both rabbits and see which ones temperament seems to have changed. You can usually feel the babies in the females stomach too-they're like small lumps underneath the rabbit. Be gentle if you're doing that though! Remember pregnant rabbits need more food, and will need extra bedding and food after birth.|`|7NtMbVCJaa	take em 2 the vet....don't kill the babbies...sell em 2 the pet shop.|`|TDLmhGauaa	Vet now! I'll take one of the babies Lol
Coc593Ikaa	I had an extensive discussion with my doctor about this, as my baby is expected to be quite large.<br>  <br>  A recent study found that women who were induced due to large babies had a HIGHER rate of c-section than women who were allowed to go into labor in their own time.<br>  <br>  Meaning, the risks of induction outweighed the risk of the large baby. I'm letting my little one hang out until he's ready. I want to do everything I can to avoid a c-section.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Forceps mean either the baby was in a bad position, the shoulders were large or you were not pushing effectively (which includes your uterus).   It's unlikely that your uterus will contract inefficiently this time, it's had practice and you were successful - and that means you are unlikely to have forceps used again.   The hip dislocation is a good sign as it means your body is nice and loose and the joints in your pelvis will stretch to accommodate this baby.   You can do this, macrosomia (overly large baby) is a 10lb + baby (larger then 9lbs 15oz), you did not have one and you probably will not have one unless you have uncontrolled gestational diabetes.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	you should have asked to be induced at 38 weeks, i really doubt they would have said yes, but you should have still asked<br>  <br>  what about a c-section?|`|UaL28atDaa	Maybe this video will help explain whether inducement will be an option for you .I hope it goes well. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/video/watch/100026/Why_is_Labor_Induced?YAFT" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...</a>|`|5f6XnInEaa	There is absolotoutly no reason to beleive at all that induction will help you out, if anything, it puts you more at risk.<br>  <br>  An 8 pound baby is average, I have no idea why people keep assuming that there bodies can not give birth to an average 8 pounder.<br>  If you were told a good 10 or 11 pounds, then it is time to start thinking, but 8 pounds is completly average, even 9 pound can be done.<br>  <br>  The size of the baby does not correlate with how long, or rough your labour was.<br>  They are two different aspects of birth, that are different.]<br>  <br>  There is absolutely no way of knowing for sure that baby in there is 8 pounds anyway...ultrasounds can be completly off.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  "THE BABY IS TOO BIG<br>  <br>  If I had a nickel...The truth is that there is absolutely no way to tell whether or not a baby will fit is until you are laboring. This much-overused of reasons to induce labor should frequently not be a reason at all. When in labor, hormones are excreted that make your hips, pelvis, and all the tissues relax. When it relaxes, it stretches. Even your hips widen. Remember, your body was made for this. It knows what to do. How many other mammals cannot give birth naturally because their babies are too big?

AA11083066	Have you gone back to your doctor yet for your follow-up appointment?  If not, ask about it when you go, if you've already gone, call them and ask.  Your age could be a factor.  Adding the third kid can cause stress and lack of sleep causing your period to become irregular. My third just turned 9 weeks and I still haven't gotten it.  But, I was always irregular and am breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned, call your doctor.

OHHHH what state do you live in? there are maybe 13 states that if a married women has insurance but it does not cover IVF they may be able to give you a grant. I found this out when I was researching for my friend. You may want to look it up!!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!|`|dwt1sidtaa	I don't think so.  We've had friends do the procedure and they had to pay out of pocket.  Contact your local tricare office and have them explain if they do or don't.<br>  Good luck.
vsuXCMqzaa	Oh boy that's a hard one! Everyone's body is different on how they process carbs!<br>  <br>  First, find out what your carb number for each meal is. Mine was 15 carbs for breakfast, 15 carbs for snacks, 30 carbs for lunch and 30-45 carbs for dinner.<br>  <br>  Check your blood sugars frequently. Try a variety of foods, also try pairing different foods together. One time during my pregnancy I had a huge piece of cake (it was a special occasion) along with a hard boiled egg (sounds wierd) but my bs numbers didn't spike at all.<br>  <br>  ~I did well on proteins and lots of veggies (of course). Also, dips and dressings helped with the numbers.<br>  ~Beans, legumes, etc. helped<br>  ~Cheese and crackers were a miracle worker.<br>  ~Hummus with whole wheat pita -great!<br>  ~Eating whole fruit did better for me than processed fruit. <br>  ~I also found that by switching from regular milk to soy that it helped my bs #'s. <br>  ~My nutritionist had me pair up carbs with fats and proteins to help slow the absorbtion so for the only time in my life real butter, oils, greasy foods was a YES!<br>  ~Nuts helped me alot for snacks.<br>  ~Raisin nut bread did better than regular toast for me.<br>  ~Hard boiled eggs, bacon and sausage (although it sounds really bad) was actually really good for the gestational diabetes and I stopped gaining as much weight.<br>  ~Also, try whole grain carbs instead of processed carbs. But keep in mind that CARBS are CARBS no matter what, so even the whole grain carbs may make your numbers high. I couldn't eat any cereal, even high fiber cereal, because my body digested it badly. But for some, the high fiber works.<br>  <br>  After you have the baby, you'll have to learn how to eat all over again (without the fats, etc. that are so yummy) but it's worth it!|`|AA10624857	I had Gestational Diabetes with my 4th child and now I have a pre-diabetic condition called Glucose Intolerance. If you do end up being diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes you will have help through your doctor's office as well as from a diabetes counselor who will help you set up your meal plan and teach you when and how to use a glucose monitor. With any form of diabetes, the consistent intake of carbohydrates is one of the most important goals you'll have. It is typically assumed that only foods that are sweet and sugary are the problem foods, but there are many foods that you have to monitor and eat in moderation. Carbohydrate containing foods are breads, pastas, rice, grains, cereals, fruit, juice, milk, yogurt, legumes (dried peas and beans), starchy vegetables (potatoes, peas, corn), starchy snacks (chips, crackers), and sweets. It is not that you should avoid these things and in fact carbohydrates, especially in the whole grain category, are an important part of a healthy diet. Your body needs things as this is where energy comes from. When I had Gestational Diabetes and now that I have Glucose Intolerance, I preferred to try to eat several small complete meals per day instead of 3 large meals plus snacks, but everyone has to plan their meals around their own preference and schedule. I try to focus most of my meals/snacks around at least 2 servings of vegetables as well as 1 serving of protein. Then, depending on the time of day I add in between 30-60 grams of carbs. It is basically like an exchange program. I look for products that are high in fiber since if the food has more than 5 grams of fiber per serving I can lower the carb content of the food. For instance, the bread I like is a 12 grain bread with 6 grams of fiber per slice. The carb count is 22 grams per serving, so 22 minus 6 equals 16 grams of carbs per serving. This way I can add some fruit or some yogurt along with a protein source such as a scrambled egg or a piece of ham and be nicely satisfied for about 2-3 hours when I plan to eat again. Foods like pizza or lasagne can be quite carb heavy, but if you plan to eat a salad or some steamed vegetables along with it, you can have one slice or piece without any problems. You can even have chocolate or sweets, but you have to eat them in smaller quantities and as part of a meal or snack that includes protein and veggies. You can relax as Gestational Diabetes is no reason to become desperate. You will eat a bit differently, monitor your blood glucose, and be monitored more closely by your doctor. You may need insulin, but not everyone does, I didn't. It is possible to have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby with Gestational Diabetes. My baby was born at 41 weeks and weighed 6 pounds 14 ounces. One of the possible problems with Gestational Diabetes is having a larger than normal birth weight baby, but it doesn't happen every time. Everything will be OK even if you do develop Gestational Diabetes.|`|YkzPfyp2aa	I had gestational diabetes with both of my children and it sucked because I had to give up a lot of different foods.<br>  I've tried the low carb waffles and cereals and they might as well be cardboard.<br>  Basically you need to eat lean meats, vegetables are high in fiber and lower your blood sugar, whole grain breads (the darker the bread the better for you), soups are also good.<br>  They have sugar free peanut butter and jelly which is actually pretty good also.|`|CdwiuxiEaa	I happen to Love Sugar Free Cake and Mousses, not because they are ALL tasty in general but because I found the best product that any diabetic would definitely come to admire. I found a company called eDietShop. They sell sugar free cake mixes that are only about 2$ and the Mousses are about 3$. They happened to have invented the sugar free cake mix and have even made the product better over the years. They even have sugar free icing to go with the cake. I love the Cakes and Mousses as well as the icing. You will like the guilt free cake mix as well.
4kfljeIGaa	I think the average age for babies to start sitting independently is around 5 to 6 months, but don't despair!  If he's crawling and pulling himself up on furniture, sitting cannot be that far behind.  Sounds like he has adequate "core strength," so maybe he just does not like to sit up?  If you own a "boppsy" nursing pillow, you could try propping him up in that.|`|AA11612508	weird. i would say help  him more. Make him sit in a chair that helps sitting. whats the name?? cant remember the name of them, but they are like 40 bucks and they help them sit up. Or instead of standing toys, ie jumparoo etc, i would put him on sitting toys, or just plain pillows around him while hes sitting on floor. Its probably just because he doesnt get enough sit time.|`|CIoBBtNhaa	We have a Bumpo chair, and it's great.  It helps DD sit, and she enjoys it.  I agree with the others, help him as much as you can- encourage him to sit whenever possible.  But don't worry about it.  My Dr. said today that at 6 months they should still be sitting assisted, so your son probably isn't that far off.  It sounds like he's super advanced in other areas!  I know it's hard to not just see when baby is lacking, but look at all the advanced things he's doing.  That's amazing!  And why would he want to sit if he can move around?  It just sounds like you have an active little guy. :)|`|tle3AGJraa	My son didn't sit until he was around 8 months old, and he did everything else late too.  Good Luck
WZQKevt8aa	Your baby sounds like he is weighing a bit more than average for his age, but then again every baby is different. Usually you start baby's on solids about 6 months and they start off with one small meal a day, but you offer them a breastfeed or formula before you offer them the solid food. As he starts getting older you slowly decrease his milk intake and increasing his solid food intake. By 12 months they usually should be having 2 milk feeds a day of about 100mls.<br>  Hope this helps|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You are the mom, feed your baby how you feel comfortable. I wouldn't worry about your child's weight, some babies are bigger. Your baby is going to be upset if you cut his formula in half! I agree with adding more solids but I don't agree with reducing the formula that much. Just give the solids at 3 meals and let him drink as much as he would want to.<br>  <br>  I know a 4 month old who drinks 32-40 oz a day.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_857.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_857.html</a><br>  An older baby can have up to 32 ounces of formula per day. In addition, he can have as much in the way of solids, water, or juice as he wants to supplement this. The mealtime formula is usually given at the end of the meals, to top off the solids in a comfortable and easy way. Even though the solids are now playing a larger role, the breast milk or formula still provides the core of the nutritional needs. If a baby begins to regularly take less than about 20 ounces per day, you might want to offer the bottle first and then solids.<br>  <br>  Thirst is an extremely strong drive. As long as a baby’s own regulating mechanism isn’t tricked by getting too much juice or water, healthy babies will take enough formula or breast milk to meet their nutritional needs. This is one good reason not to put juice in the bottle.<br>  <br>  Let your baby set the pace, but if he continues to consistently take more than 32 ounces or less than 20 ounces, run it by your pediatrician.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Well if your doctor is concerned about his intake, then he might be overweight. There is a difference between chunky and obese. It sounds to me like he is eating a bit much, and I would go with your doctor's advice. You don't want him to overeat already. That will cause weight problems when he's older. Try it for a week or so, and then see what you and your doctor think.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	The doctor went to school for a reason and has a degree for a reason....although if you feel that u dont want to do what he said then dont its your baby...my son at about 6 months at 2 meals a day and snacked in between and at about 26 ounces of formula and his doctor said he was find and keep doing the same thing at about 8 months he was up to 3 meals a day and about 20 ounces of formula....as they grow the less formula they eat and the more solids they eat...my doctor said everything i was doing was fine...jus go with ur gut tho u know ur son better than anyone!|`|AA11795652	I breastfeed, but my son is 10 months and I have never taken away any of his breastfeeding times even as he added meals and snacks, so I guess I'm with you in that he doesn't need to take away that many bottles but 40 oz does seem like a lot to me.|`|zcSAWWCkaa	just try your doctors advice for a little while, you can always go back to the way you use to do things if you dont think it is working.|`|l9t60RdSaa	my 6 month little girl is on 3 meals a day and 3 bottles of 9oz and she is fine. he will still be getting what he needs from only 20 oz. i use apatamil follow on milk and that says on the side they should be having 1 pint a day. some babies are bigger then others. my daughter is 21lbs now. she was never small tho she was 9lbs 9 when she was born.
GnKwE7Rmaa	As my fellow mothers answered, if your baby has taken some of the fomula but then refuse it, try him again within after 20 mins and if he refuses it then throw it. If your baby hasn't taken any including having his mouth around the teat then cool it rapidly and then place in the fridge. Use for next feed!.......... If you work on the principle that you only reheat once you can't go far wrong. I only ever left made up formula milk for approx 8hours  and followed the reheat once rule and it's never done my little one any harm!... but at the end of the day no matter how expensive the milk is its no comparison to your childs health so if your worried at all make it fresh!!.|`|xmVGViPiaa	If he drinks from it at all (even just puts his mouth on the nipple), throw it away.  His spit can get into the milk and introduce bacteria to it.<br>  <br>  Also as per the directions on most formulas you aren't supposed to use them after 24 hrs of them being mixed and refrigerated.|`|U12Xuyemaa	No if it is half a bottle. Yes if it was a sterile bottle and your fridge is cold enough.|`|ORpbq3bAaa	no once he started the bottle he must finish it. if he didnt then you have to throw it out. read the label on the formula.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	if he hast touched it at all then yes its fine. otherwise it should be tossed within the hour:)|`|sbeoF50gaa	I stick to the one hour rule, several people have stated that the baby has bacteria in their mouth which can cause infection that sounds logical to me as well. It sounds like a waste but better safe than sorry when it comes to babies. I used the "already made" formula that came in cans. Unless I was going somewhere then I took a bottled water and formula already IN the bottle and mixed when needed. You wouldn't want to potentially make ur baby sick, so always use "when in doubt throw it out"|`|RzaP9bQmaa	I always make my formula around 9 at night, I do enough to last the rest of the night and the day, i then put the bottles in the fridge and warm them up when they are needed.  After warming a bottle up and my baby does not want the bottle or does not finish it within two hour's  I pour the rest away.  I Would say no and even if he does drink half of it or none of it.  I just asked my partner on what he thought of the Question and he said that he would throw it away as well.  Every person is different as to what they would do. The above is my opinion and what I would do and what I do.  Hope this helps|`|AA11612508	no i wouldnt do it. formula is expensive, so treat it that way. dont make too much. if you think baby will drink 4 maybe, make only 2 and then if they want more, make more. that way you are only throwing out about 2 ounces each time give or take. Just dont make big batches of it.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	If he drinks from it at all, you should only keep it for another hour, and then toss it.  Bacteria can form.  I don't take chances with formula.
4BBjhHAnaa	there is a good chance.<br>  <br>  was it within the last 72 hours? if so, and you don't want to get pregnant, take plan B ASAP.<br>  <br>  <br>  if it was longer than that, wait a few weeks and take a pregnancy test, even if you get your period.  It is possible to be pregnant and still get your period.|`|pJgxPNTTaa	You can go to the DR and they can do a blood test before you miss your period. I took a preg. test about 2 weeks before i was late and mine came back positive. (we were trying) <br>  <br>  If you just did it within 72 hours go to walmart or cvs and get the pill called PLAN B it will eliminate anything going on. Its about $50. It will ONLY work if it has been less than 72 hours. Good Luck|`|oIBR7FUIaa	what does 30 minutes have to do with anything. You can get pregnant from 1 minute of unprotected sex just as easily as you can from and hour of unprotected sex. Maybe you should do some research on how sex works and how babies are made before you have sex.|`|afAbSq5gaa	Any time that  you have sex you can get pregnant, i think you are looking too much into this this soon, but yes there is always a chance that you can be pregnant when you have sex!|`|AOCwkR7caa	In stead of asking I would wait till your next period is due and if you are 4 days late then take a test!|`|8YRJBrisaa	its a possibility|`|2T5KtGHwaa	u could be...u can get pregnant from pre ejaculation.|`|tjGFRs1Kaa	Since you had sex with no condom, the answer is maybe.<br>  <br>  Even if you DID have sex with a condom, the answer is still maybe.
DVmDWDC4aa	If a test came up positive, you are pregnant. It is practically IMPOSSIBLE to get false positive results because of the chemical HCG that the test checks for. False negatives are common. False positives DON'T Happen except in VERY rare circumstances.<br>  <br>  You're pregnant, see a doctor.<br>  <br>  You can get pregnant at ANY time in your cycle, though obviously you have more or less fertile times.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Most likely no.  Women usually ovulate around 12-16 before their period starts.  Since sperm can live in the body for 3 days that means you are fertile from about 19 days before your period to about 12.  Again, it really depends on the women's cycle.  You are more likely to ovulate after your period then right before.  <br>  <br>  Note: You would not get a positive pregnancy test after two days.  The egg would not have had a chance to implant itself.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	If you're having sex, you can get pregnant.|`|afAbSq5gaa	you can get pregnant anytime that you have sex, so yes it is entirely possible!|`|IA5zVfk0aa	ya but it would take longer for it to show up on a test... maybe you concieved a few weeks ago|`|IhOLZYxeaa	yes, its possible.<br>  go to a doctor.<br>  good luck hun|`|c1WrWhscaa	Yes - you can get pregnant any time of the month as every woman's cycle is different - I'm actually 5 weeks pregnant and I've had my period in the middle of that time...hope this helps!

And that is how she is.<br>  So I say we can suggest all the names but only you as the mother know how the names make you feel. And help in some very small way pave the vision of how you want your daughter to be.<br>  Congrats and the best of luck.
oxriDchOaa	Why give your daughter a name that she'll have to spell out every time she introduces herself for the rest of her life?  "Creatively" spelled names look bad on a resume and give people the impression that you're didn't know how to spell the name properly.<br>  <br>  There are better ways to express your creativity than with her name.  Keep it simple.  Cynthia looks like a lovely young lady.  Sinthia looks like trailer trash.  Don't give your kid a permanent disadvantage.|`|7drjpohUaa	Cinthia<br>  Sinthea<br>  Cynthea<br>  Synthia<br>  <br>  ?|`|n1mwxljzaa	Synthea<br>  <br>  how about:<br>  Cinnthea<br>  Cynnthea|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	Cinthia <br>  Thats all I can think of. <br>  I would actually go for Sinthia if you are going to change the spelling because it is pronounced the same way and will be less confusing.|`|Eznh0ebYaa	Sinthya<br>  Cinthya<br>  Cynthea<br>  Synthea|`|9QVjNaIPaa	Synthea|`|tvsfvWKKaa	Synthea|`|bQCfOftxaa	synthea
tcHkn0VIaa	You are craving it because your body and your BABY need it. It is irresponsible to not eat a balanced diet when you are pregnant. Dont fight the cravings. You can pick up on eating a vegetarian diet once it is only your health you are toying with. Sorry I just believe that we have the desire to eat meat for a reason- our bodies need it! I do not believe in animal cruelty but i do believe in eating properly.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	ive been craving cold cuts - ham in particular .. yes i gave in .. i just put it either in my salad or make a sandwich.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	i was a vegan before i got pregnant and im craving hamburgers every few hrs.. i just gave in and it tastes sooooooo good|`|yKS2UI87aa	I know exactly how you feel. I walked into a Quickmart and smelled hot dogs and my mouth watered. I haven't had a hot dog longer than I've been a Vegetarian --Went and got veggie dogs, but really didn't help, tried nuts and PB. Still got the cravings throughout preg. There are websites that can help and I logged on and made alot of different items.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	Not a vegetarian but old wives' tales say craving meat is a sign of a boy! Congrats on the baby and good luck with your meat dilemna!|`|G7OwyyHPaa	vegetarians are weird.<br>  <br>  no offense.|`|PxlZtBUmaa	eat some chicken!<br>  i cravedd hot italian sausages for a while, i eventually gave in for the sake of my babyyy!<br>  but if you care about the chicken that muchh, i wouldn't budge.|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	There are always substitutes, but don't beat yourself up if you want to eat some chicken.  Your body needs extra iron right now.  Good luck!
E5CnUdhsaa	well for me all dirty nappies go in a nappy sack and outside in the bin, as for days out and a 8 week old baby, food should be brought just incase and most certainly nappies etc to change them, she maybe didnt bring food knowing that he wouldnt be needing fed during that time....but i still would of brought a just incase bottle.|`|joiacDUdaa	Most people the don't have children are often the most critical when it comes to "parenting"  ask anyone without children "what they would do" and most have all the answers.  The truth is.. as a parent you just try to do what's best for you/baby.  If she's a new mom it may be difficult to take the baby to public places especially if she's nursing.  Most people frown upon a nursing infant in public so it's often distressing to the baby and mother to go out.  An 8 week old baby doesn't eat baby food.  He/she either nurses or is on formula.  If the mother nurses she might have been embarassed or there was no place to go... * I refuse to nurse a child in a bathroom.. As for changing an infant on the go.. That's a whole other matter as well.  Were you in her car or your car?  If it's your automobile.. You may not have felt comfortable.... Or she may not either.  It's always a gamble when you out.. You feel like you have to pack up everything but, the kitchen sink!  When my children were little I had a small diaper bag stashed in my vehilce in case I forgot diapers, wipes, toys etc.. I even brought an extra outfit in case of a mishap.  She's not a bad parent she just might be overwhelmed.  Having a close friend be so critical would be a turn-off as well.  As for the diapers... take it with a grain of salt and maybe have a double lined can where diapers can be disposed of- or leave some small grocery bags where she can grab them and tie up the diaper.  I usually have some packed in my diaper bag at all times... <br>  <br>  Hopefully if you have children you'll NEVER, EVER make any type of faux paus.. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|IFDfpbFJaa	That's very bad parenting and not having consideration for other people.|`|qayCggxMaa	Well, she just may not have known what else to do with the dirty diapers - I at least try to throw them in bathroom trash and wrap them in a plastic bag if I can.  Next time she's over you might offer some plastic grocery bags or a seperate trash bag for her to put the diapers in.  Not bringing food for the baby or not changing its diaper though is not good.  She may just be absentminded though (which the sleep deprivation can certainly do), so try to cut her a little slack and help remind her when you can.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Thank god for breastfeeding, can't forget what you already got! Sounds like bad parenting to me, she can't afford to not have food for her baby, that's just selfish. I bet she had everything she needed. as far as diapers in the trash, that's just gross not neglectful. Not changing the diaper however is very neglectful and just wrong. I think you should say something to her, don't just ignore it.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Did you tell her to do something else with the diapers, like put them in a grocery bag first and then in garbage can. i have put diapers in the kitchen garbage and they stunk the place up, so i would use a grocery bag first. Not changing the diaper though,that's bad, not bringing anything for her to eat? that's bad,|`|5f6XnInEaa	I don't change my son every time I go out.....I guess I'm an awful parent too.<br>  He doesn't always need to be changed, and you have to take into consideration, that not changing a baby or taking food with you, if you are out for less than 4 hours is completly ok, as most babies feed 3 to 4 hourly.<br>  <br>  As for the diapers in the kitchen bin....I feel bad for the poor woman being judged so harshly, over a petter stench.<br>  I too assumed a diaper in the bin was appropriate...but apparently not.<br>  Granted, I put nappies in the 'nappy sack' to stop the stink, but still.<br>  Diapers go in bin.<br>  <br>  Be grateful she didn't leave it on your floor.<br>  <br>  I think you should definitely cut her some slack, not everyone is 'perfect' by your standards, and you must understand it is not easy being a new mother.<br>  My assumption, based on your narrow minded view, is that you dont have kids.|`|PJBjllsVaa	well, if you didn't like her putting the diapers in the regular trash you should have simply said can you please put the diapers in a plastic bag and instruct her where to put them. when i am at someones house i always ask where i should deposit the diapers (and i carry plastic baggies to put them in before i toss them)<br>  as for the going out somewhere and not changing the baby or bringing food that is just stupid. and yes it's bad parenting. she sounds like an idiot|`|3cMRhJHSaa	My son is 4 weeks old and I change him every 30 mins to an hour he fills his diapers up very quickly and not bringing food for her doesn't sound right at all, My son breastfeeds about every hour to two hours so Idintt see how she can go out for an entire day without bringing enough food but everyone parents diffrent.|`|dypJyCckaa	I think so. If you cant remember to take care of the baby, it would die. You might just want to go to parenting classes or keep a schedule nearby to help you remember. You wouldn't want to have a baby when your not quite ready for it.|`|WZQKevt8aa	Dirty diapers should go in the outside bin, and the rest of it is just bad parenting. She sounds quite lazy and selfish. Poor baby.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	The diapers...where else can she put them? But not changing the diaper is pretty bad, that poor baby needs to be changed when wet.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	All parenting styles are different...did the baby seem neglected was he or she crying because he or she was hungry or needed a diaper change?...i thru my sons diapers in my kitchen trash to i dont see the big deal about that...forgetting food and not changing the diaper seems a lil weird to me...i packed everything when i went out and i would always find a place to change my sons diaper certain people are different tho when u have kids ur parenting style might be different and someone might call it bad parenting but its ur style...if i personally had to choose i would say it was bad parenting when u have a baby u except the responsibility to care for them...but who am i to say.....o yes and if i was in someone elses house i always asked them were to throw it away or they would just take it 9 times out of ten it was in the kitchen trash|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	personally, i carry a stash of the plastic grocery bags with me in a diaper bag (you never know when the next diaper change will strike you) :).. but the issue that i am concerned with is the food that the baby is having - i have never had a case with my daughter when the diapers would have a foul smell (that's why i never understood parents who complain about the diaper-smelling house).. anyways.. if a person doesn't have kids and i am a guest in that house, i would have been more "aware" of the surroundings - i can only imagine the sound that your jaw made when it dropped on the floor at a sight of a diaper being tossed in a garbage can :).. well, next time - now that you have more experience with this - give that person a bunch of plastic grocery bags and tell to put diapers in those.. also, get a set of gloves for yourself to handle this "issue" in the future.. as for forgetting the food for the baby, i think you should have called child services - it was not right..|`|F1g0xMIMaa	I honestly think it is bad parenting.|`|F1DXUByNaa	Sounds to me like bad parenting.
23Al1b4aaa	top 3:<br>  Zarya<br>  Phoebe<br>  Oxana|`|nwi9Fv9Baa	Zarya - eh, it's ok.  I'd go with some other version of Sarah like Suri or Saria first.  Or perhaps even the Arabic name "Zahra." (which means "flower" I think?) <br>  <br>  Tahlia - pretty foreign name, but not really my personal taste<br>  <br>  Xtina - No.  It's a cool for a SN but not a baby name.  :/<br>  <br>  Phobe - ...Phoebe?  I'm not sure if this is a misspelling?  "Phobe" reminds me too much of the suffix.  (I.E. Arachnophobe/Arachnophobia)  Phoebe is a clever little name though.<br>  <br>  Pria - Looks too much like a nickname, imo.  But could be a cute nick name.<br>  <br>  Oxana - I really like this name.  I prefer the more Slavic "Oksana," though both are correct.<br>  <br>  Karissa - I prefer Melissa (just my personal preference), but this IS a cute name with a modern twist.<br>  <br>  Harlee - Not digging the -ee ending.  I would also put this on a boy before I'd ever put it on a girl.<br>  <br>  Jozlyn - needs to be respelled...  Cute little name otherwise.<br>  <br>  Berklee - Same with Harlee, except this one is even more masculine.<br>  <br>  Dahlia - Reminds me of Tahlia above, but has a softer sound that it.  It is also a flower, is it not?|`|7riwKot7aa	I like Berklee and Dahlia<br>  but if you want another I think you may like..<br>  Pria Lee<br>  or <br>  Jozy Dahala  say it like: "Joe-zee Da-ha-la" <br>  i love that and i think you may too|`|8WbfmK5daa	Tahlia is sooo cute go with that one lol.<br>  <br>  Harlee could be interesting too. Think it could be really cute.|`|uGn0FyWwaa	Just horrible.|`|FAGI8owFaa	I like Tahlia and Zarya.. Good Luck|`|BV0Hn4jDaa	i like phobe and dahlia<br>  is Xtina a name?|`|HMPdnhApaa	If you mean "Phoebe" then that is my favorite.|`|7drjpohUaa	Phobe but Phoebe<br>  Zarya<br>  Harlee but Harley<br>  Jozlyn<br>  Berklee but Berkleigh|`|fSKQSXBvaa	The only one I like is Karissa and Harlee...|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Top 3;<br>  1.

G2auAv1Saa	Not sure about how much- each baby has different appetites. <br>  <br>  For the bottles:  My daughter was very picky about what she liked. I would buy one of each and she what she tends to take to best.|`|5f6XnInEaa	How much they should be eating depends on the weight of your baby.<br>  My son was eating 60 mls per feeding, so about 2 fl. ounces, at one month old.<br>  <br>  Usually, the tin of formula has a little guide on the side suggesting how much, although I really would speak to your childs doctor formally, to get the proper information.<br>  <br>  We use AVENT bottles, they have worked well for us so far, we have no reason to complain about them, except for the price!<br>  We currently have 6 bottles, that obviously we wash and sterilise on a daily basis.|`|K3FuGAdOaa	Relax. There are so many types of bottles. My husband I used 2 kinds. The Avent and Playtex Venti Aire. The Avent bottles leaked and they were a pain and the nipples were to fast of a flow. We then bought the Playtex ones and they are awesome. They helped with colic (which she never was) and she wasnt taking in as much air as the Avent bottles. Also with the Playtex bottles They have these rubber filters in the bottom and holes in the bottom plastic piece that vent out the air and keep air from getting in. You just have to do a trial and error. My daughter @ 1 month was eating 2 oz every 1 1/2 to 2 hours. trust your mothers instincts...do what you think is best. :) Good Luck|`|ugbe40X3aa	at four weeks she could be taking up to five ounce at a feed i would recomend aptimil first as a formula milk it is a bit more expensive than other milks but it is the closest to breast milk so she may take to it better than others it does give you a guide on the milk box how much she should have but if she is feeding every four hours than i would say get six bottles that should be enough i do prefer avent bottles as the adapt as the child grows they cna be used with bottle teats and then as she gets older can be used with juice cup top and handles etc|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	one piece of advice - don't get those bottles with the drop-ins.. baby will be exposed to too much plastic and it's not healthy.. the best bottles that i have found are dr brown's - they are worth every penny.. get the gift set - it has all the bottles that you will ever need plus the nipples have varied opening (larger with each size), so that the flow adjusts to the baby's ability to take the milk. as for the feedings themselves, let the baby decide - start with 2oz and work from there.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	:(|`|WZQKevt8aa	Usually the tin of formula will have a guide on the back as to how much to feed your baby, or you can get your doctor to make up a chart based on how much she weighs. I would only buy a few bottles at first just in case she can't suck on the teats properly. For example, Avent teats are wide and she may not be able to suck on them properly and then you may have to buy the bottles with smaller, narrower teats. Also, don't forget to get some sterilising solution or a steriliser.<br>  So, just buy a couple of bottles and if she is fine to suck on them and is getting the milk, I would probably advise you to buy 6-7 in total. Also another tip that I found that helped and saved time when my 2 year old son was a baby was making 24 hours worth of bottles up at night, so you can just get them and heat them up straightaway. Good luck!|`|3cMRhJHSaa	My son is one month old and takes about 3oz of bottle. I buy the playtex bottles where you drop in the liners I like those a lot.<br>  All babies are different with how much they drink buy the formula and follow the directions on the can for 4 oz of bottle she may eat that much or less. I pump my breastmilk and my son is 4 weeks old and drinks about 3oz sometimes more.<br>  I use the simulac formula advanced shield<br>  <br>  With playtex just buy the drop ins(the liners) you change the liner each time you make a new bottle|`|AxiUWLtPaa	I bought a soothie starter kit to start with. Now I use them and the Dr. Browns bottles.

I like Ethan better than Evan for a boy, and as for the girl name: Vivianna instead of Vivian.|`|JKwOFuiuaa	Definitely Ethan over Evan..though if you want a cutesy nickname..it would work better for Evan=Ev? I don't know but a lil Viv would be cute too.|`|r6IRYVRnaa	girl name is um well if you like it! the boy name ethan love it!!|`|sGqae5GOaa	I adore the name Hayley|`|nAOlBmzDaa	Not crazy about Vivian - makes me think of  a 70's hairdresser ... lol<br>  <br>  but Ethan Wade is darling! Good Luck! <br>  <br>  i always come up with nicknames AFTER the kid is born... they just kinda come out. they're never premeditated....
NbJbZXtGaa	Boy: Finn<br>  I am not a fan of the "y" in boys names, but I LOVE Finn. Wanted it for my last one, but DH vetoed it.<br>  <br>  Owen and Nolan and Heathe are too "common" nowadays for me, but all the boys names you have listed are very nice. I like them. Actually, I do like Ryder, even with  the "y".<br>  <br>  Girls, I like Jemma and Giselle the best. Isabella is too common for me, and Sawyer sounds too masculine. I know a little boy named Sawyer.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Congratulations! My favorite names are Sawyer Kate and Isla Berlin from your girls' list, and Nolan Heath from your boys'. Nolan is one of my favorite names too.<br>  <br>  Ryder is cool, and so is Holden. You must be a literature fan. :)|`|v6DRUwH7aa	Isabella & Ryder.|`|h57t7FAjaa	You have a lot of very nice names!<br>  <br>  <br>  Aurora Belle- very cute, I love the name Aurora :)<br>  <br>  Sawyer Kate - I think Sawyer sounds rather masculine.  I do like some boys names on girls (taylor, jordan) but I don't see this one going both ways.  Kate Sawyer maybe?<br>  <br>  Jemma Isolde - Not my favorite, but its cute.<br>  <br>  Isabella (Bella) - I love this name.  mn suggestions Kate, Paige, Claire, Eden.<br>  <br>  Briea Eden-wynter - I think Briea is a really nice name, not sure on the middle name though.  I think two mn's is fine, but I don't like them hyphenated, & i'm not sure those two go.  Briea Eden or Briea Winter is lovely on it's own.<br>  <br>  berlin - i dont really like it :(<br>  <br>  Isla - I think this name is gorgeous.  mn suggestions: Mae, June, Kate, Paige, Rowan, Esme.<br>  <br>  Esme - this name is also gorgeous! mn suggestions: Rowan, Claire, Isla, Sawyer, Audra.<br>  <br>  Giselle - cute, but not my favorite.  I think it'd make a nice mn though!<br>  <br>  <br>  BOYS<br>  keiran - This is one of my favorite boy names! mn suggestions: James, Jude, Ryder, Flynn, Rhys.<br>  <br>  Callum - Also very nice.<br>  <br>  Owen - ok, not my favorite. mn suggestions: Jude, Cole, Joshua, Isaac.<br>  <br>  Heathe - cute.<br>  <br>  Fynn - its growing on me :)  Flynn would be nice also.<br>  <br>  Jude - I think this would make a better mn.<br>  <br>  Nolan - very nice! mn suggestions: Ryder, Fynn, Heathe, Gage, Luke, Parker.<br>  <br>  Holden - Another one of my favorites! mn suggestions: Ryder, Flynn, Jude, Rhys, Jayce.<br>  <br>  Ryder - not a favorite, but it's cute.  Better as a mn.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck! :)|`|tWKZVDG2aa	Out of your girls names I like Isla the best.  I think Isla Jemma would be really cute.<br>  <br>  Jude is really cute for a boy.  I also like Fynn, although I prefer the spelling Finn. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|AaoclPYCaa	My picks would be Sawyer and Jude.  Sawyer is such a cool name for a girl.|`|nogoUTDXaa	I know I'll probably get slated for it but I think that most of those are horrible. "Giselle" sounds like a mispelling of "gazelle" which i'm sure isn't something anybody would want to be named after and I'm sure a little Internet research on Isolde/Iseult should put you off that one.<br>  <br>  Jude is honestly the only name I can say I like there.|`|WIEPISyeaa	LOVE<br>  Jemma Isolde<br>  Isabella Sawyer<br>  Esme Berlin<br>  <br>  (Sawyer Kate might be a little much....LOST fan?)<br>  <br>  Kieran Owen<br>  Owen Ryder<br>  Fynn Heathe<br>  Jude Callum|`|XLsnuAqmaa	from your list my favorites are<br>  GIRLS:  Sawyer (i also like this for a boys name), Jemma, Isla<br>  <br>  BOYS:  Owen  yeah, this is the only one i prefer from the list =)|`|9qFBftcpaa	I like all of them, but my favorites are Isabella for a girl and Nolan for a boy.|`|cWPbH2Neaa	Aurora Belle<br>  &<br>  Holden or Ryder.|`|b0yNkuUjaa	Isabella for the best girl name and Nolan for best boy name.|`|IjkPBYlkaa	BERLIN AND NOLAN :)|`|lqLzULXEaa	I like Giselle for a ?Girl? and i like jude for a ?boy?<br>  <br>  <br>  ?All very cute names btw?|`|FDQg1ldFaa	swayer kate... lol dont name the kid after lost u should name your kid Name cause like sumbody will say wuts your name and theyll say Name and when there little teachers will get mad when they sign there name next to the lign that says name theyll b like dont copy it write you name lol|`|aLdrjsJMaa	Isabella(Bella) Taylor<br>  <br>  Keiran Taylor<br>  <br>  sry I just like Taylor with both of those names!!|`|Rzwrz6vdaa	I like Isabella and Owen a lot! congrats!<br>  please don'tuse winter spelled "wynter"<br>  <br>  what about Owen Jude and Isabella Eden?|`|FMOFA8ckaa	i think aurora belle is beautiful. what about..aria joy for a girl?<br>  guys: jade, landon, and owen is cute.|`|ek1193Qiaa	girl: aurora belle and berlin and giselle<br>  <br>  boys: nolan|`|nDROyHmFaa	Girl: Isabella<br>  <br>  Boy: Heathe|`|AA10461222	I like from your list Aurora Belle & Isabella.

pXSKSS3daa	"and WOULD have had to say something about it"<br>  <br>  Like she was obligated to? How rude. I hate how young automatically means you're a bad parent. The people that judge you so quickly don't know how you raise your baby/child in your own home. Too many people make ignorant assumptions and that's why younger parents feel so judged all the time.<br>  <br>  Thankfully that hasn't happened to me. I'll be 24 tomorrow but I'm considered young to some, especially to be married and have a baby. But you know what? I'm a good wife and a good mother, no matter my age.<br>  <br>  I did, once at Walmart, get an older man that came up to myself and Noah and ask him where his daddy was. It was in the middle of the day, on a weekday, and his daddy was at work(which I informed this man of). I guess having a baby gives people the right to say ANYTHING they'd like to you?|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Yeah, people have looked down at me because I'm 21 and I have 3 kids. Not many have had nerve to say anything, but a ew crossed that line. <br>  <br>  One older woman said that it was disgusting that I kept my baby. I said that her mother must have been a bad parent to raise someone with such bad manners and that she should be ashamed for not minding her own business.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I have never heard and honestly would feel like slapping someone, just because you are young does not make you a bad parent and just because you are older does not make you a good parents. I am 24 with a 2 year old and a 4 month. It takes more than age to determine whether or not a parent is "qualified" to be a parent.|`|ORpbq3bAaa	same thing with me i just turned 22. but i look like a teenager. people just ask me how old my baby and if she is mine because i look young. then when i tell them my age they say "omg you look so young". and sometimes i just get weird looks from older ladies and i could just imagen what they are thinking. i hate it i wish some people would just keep their mouth shut and eyes to them selfs|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would have reported her jugemental butt! what is you were younger lol was she gonna lay out on the floor in front of your kid?|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	that was a rude cashier.. don't mind her..|`|9dDKr0Abaa	I was 19 when I was pregnant with my 1st (23 now) and one time when my mom went with me to an appointment 'cause my then boyfriend now husband couldn't go. Some lady had the nerve to ask my mom why she let me get pregnant because I looked like I was 12. My mom of course told her my age and we all just laughed but I felt like punching her! 'Cause what the heck do you say to that?!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	yeah, ive gotten plenty 'you dont look old enough to have kids' comments but i say 'well, i graduated high school, i have a good job, a new house, new car, i pay my own bills, etc so i dont think age has anything to do with it'.|`|F4FJVq37aa	WOW, no that has never happened to me. I get told I look younger then I am. But no one has ever said that to me. I don't know what I would have said. I can't believe some people have the nerve to talk to others like that!|`|3w7VztEWaa	wow I wouldn't even know what to say to someone like that.<br>  especially me being pregnant and 16. I would have just looked shocked and asked for my recite hahah if you were younger you could have fired her.<br>  that is just rude.|`|x5OHjdtmaa	i would hav hit her in the mouth most people jus say omg ur so young tho to me...|`|7vRVF6wUaa	People are just stupid!  Sometimes you just have to smile sweetly and cuss under your breath!|`|3cMRhJHSaa	I get the whole"OMG YOU LOOK SO YOUNG THING TOO"<br>  I was taking my daughter to pre-school and I was walking through the hallway to sign her in I had my newborn in the carseat and a couple moms were talking about one of them being pregnant, Well one of them who knew me stopped me and said oh you had your baby and went on to tell the other ladies I had three children one women said "oh hows it having three" then the next one says OMG YOU DONT EVEN LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE ONE. I smiled at her and gave her one of those yeah whatever looks. Some people tend to be rude or think because were young we cant be a good mom which we all know is not true at all.<br>  My other friend was pregnant along with her other two and a women said to her well I hope your done since youve already had all these kids so young.<br>  I don't think the age matters it is if you take care of your child,love them and can support them in which my husband and I do, So I try not to even let it bother me :)|`|sbeoF50gaa	Jeez some people just don't think before they talk. I bet you gave her something to think about though. I'm 24 with a 5 year old and a lot of people say "why did you start so young?" and I'm always like "why do you care" I'd rather be a young mom so I'm old enough to meet my grand kids and hopefully my great grand kids someday. I don't think I would have thought to say what you did. Good job! She had no right to express her personal opinion that wasn't what she was gettin paid for!|`|ZKxgqK3zaa	well that was just rude! No this has not happened to me. The best thing I can tell you is to just brush it off and keep on walking! You are better than that momma!
3EhoJ42zaa	They usually wait a few hours after you've had the baby before you can take a shower.  I had my son at 7:34 pm at night, we got put into our room at about 9:45 pm and they didn't let me take a shower until the next morning.  They want to make sure you have enough strength to stand in there and so you dont lose too much blood and pass out.  They basically want you to take it very very easy at first.  The nurse will want you to call her when you need to pee so she can wlak you to the bathroom and stand near by (at the door not in the bathroom with you) to make sure blood doesn't come gushing out or you pass out.  The nurses will come in every four hours to check on you and baby.  They constantly check your vitals which is really annoying in the middle of the night.  You basically sit in the hospital bed with your baby while everyone brings things to you.|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	I took a bath the next morning, I had my daughter at night.  I too had stitches down there, it was ok...they have to come in and check you down there all the time when you are in the hospital, front to back, just to make sure everything looks ok.  They never let you rest, it seems that they are ALWAYS coming into your room and bothering you or the baby...you will definitely be ready to go home to be left alone.  It is all totally worth it for that precious baby though.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	well they clean you up and make you pee the after the baby to make sure your bladder is working. i took a shower the next day i just was really sore so it took a little while and i couldnt reach alot of areas like my legs or feet.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I had my baby at 12:51am on a Wednesday morning.  About 4 hours later I had a shower (I couldn't walk earlier because I had an epidural).  I had 2 stitches which wasn't too painful.  I went home that afternoon at 4:30pm.|`|x7vTKP24aa	they check to make sure verything is ok down there.. no swelling or bad discharge. i took a bath like 1.5 hour after baby was born|`|Vbcvu2Rdaa	They get you up after a little bit, make sure you are okay to stand, and help you to the bathroom, make you pee, and some places let you take a shower that day, but I had to wait until the following morning.  Nurses will come in and out during your stay, checking on you and giving you pain meds if needed, and your doctor will come at least once to check you and see how everything is going.|`|dTPg4uYzaa	i wasnt able to take a shower till 2-3 days later but i had a c-section|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I would have been able to shower the next day....buut the showers were broke! So, I spent three days without a shower..yuck!
SlBsJ3NRaa	Do everyone a favor a go John Bobbit yourself. Everyone sick of your questions putting down American women. Either shut up or stay in YOUR country.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I think he is immature. It is NOT selfish for a mother to ask the father to help support the child no matter if your Italian or whatever. Most men step up and no court order is needed for the others the child support can't be put into effect until the baby is born. Grow up and support your child!!!|`|M2yERqNSaa	i bet you can lick your own brain and you wont feel anything|`|E5CnUdhsaa	why? are you repeating this? please stop|`|4eTyCuRSaa	He is disgusting for running away from his responsibilities, abandoning his children and wife...Oh wait they weren't married I bet.<br>  <br>  So this woman is also irresponsible for having children that she could not provide a stable home for.<br>  <br>  It's reprehensible that people in this situation decide to bring another human being into such a miserable existence!
WKt58GYLaa	I've been on the Mirena for 2 years and no periods for about the past 18 months.  It's normal for periods to slow down or stop while on the Mirena.|`|6a054048746da7edf01f4a2e7fa8cac0aa	yes very norm. i have not had one in 3 years now|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	I have had Mirena for about 2 years now, and I maybe have had one period. And a light one if that. So it is normal.
P5o8N4H9aa	Babies all get their teeth at different ages and at different rates. Some will get them at 4 months and others don't get teeth for a long time. If you're really worried about it you can ask a her pediatrician about it and see what they say, but my opinion is that all kids are different. Just like kids walk and talk at different ages.. same with teeth and hair.<br>  <br>  and Happy Birthday to her. :]|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	if you are concerned - and i see that you have a reason - then locate a pediatric dentist and get an xray of the gums to make sure that the teeth are there (but are just a little delayed to come out).. i think it's better know that go on in a darkness..|`|AA11210211	Its normal my 1 yr old has 4 teeth and is working on a new one.My friends son didn't have any teeth until he was about 13 months old.|`|avx7bLnKaa	normal, mine got first tooth at 11 months and i think had 2-3 by 1st birthday<br>  a friend of mine she didn't get first tooth until 14 months<br>  <br>  just depends<br>  <br>  my son's friends all got their teeth months before he did and they are a month younger|`|IMzza26Aaa	It is completely normal.  I know someone who's child at 4 weeks (yup) had 2 teeth.  My son didn't get his first tooth until he was 6 months old even though he had been teething for several months before that.  When my son was 12 and we were putting braces on him the dentist had to pull 4 baby teeth that just wouldn't come out on their own.  I have heard that the longer they have their baby teeth the better it is (not sure why though).|`|tQPvv0Glaa	I think that's normal.  I remember that my older 2 kids only had their 2 bottom teeth in their 1 year pics.  Don't worry, they'll come =)|`|AA11109728	That's perfectly normal for some kids!  My daughter didn't get her first two teeth in until she was 14 months old, so I know now that pretty much anything goes!|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Don't worry, my son is the same way... was told it was normal by health care provider. He is 13 months now and only has 4
HEdGGmkhaa	I had a VBAC, you have to make sure you take care of your body, follow strict instructions to the letter!<br>  I had a midwife who believed in me so that helped a lot...<br>  Keep your blood pressure down, relax and get some good solid medical advice but also understand that the docs are going to probably sway you towards a c-section as they are afraid of liability issues and it's easier for them timing wise.<br>  <br>  I would consult with a doctor who has a midwife on staff or search for one locally who you can talk to about this.<br>  <br>  Just to let you know, doctors told me I would never have a vaginal birth and I did, one of them even visited me in the hospital room and said congrats....all I could say was I told you so lol....he was a little butt hurt!<br>  <br>  You need to believe in your body!|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	My sister had an Emer C section with her first son, she 2 wanted a VBAC so when she fell preg the 2nd time she opted for it.<br>  The allowed her to do this, they just kept a closer eye on her, she was successful and had a vaginal birth with her daughter.<br>  Tell them what u want and be firm.<br>  Hope this helps x|`|S5n5Za78aa	not to be rude but you may have better answers asking this question in the PREGNANCY board because in trying to concieve alot of woman are not quite pregnant yet to share these types of experiences

Anna Marie. It's your choice, but I don't really like Alexandra- personally!|`|o0QtZ5svaa	Honestly, quite dull. Marie is very common; I wish my parents had not made it my second name. Be creative, not conventional.|`|8oRrMJwhaa	I like it but it's really common. You hear the name Alex a lot! And it seems like every girl has the middle name Marie. You should pick something different.|`|FMOFA8ckaa	i think alexandra marie is a bit muchh. alex marie is pretty if she went by that.|`|Tx5T4Sq1aa	Ugh, EVERYONE's named Alex.

5WP9rLTlaa	its on a big upfront cost. when you honk abut it you would probably spend thirty dollars a week on disposables and at the end of the week- they're gone for good.<br>  pay thirty dollars for a cloth diaper and you can use it for three years!<br>  you only need 24 cloth diapers as opposed to 70 disposables a week.<br>  cloth diapers over three years cost about $700, disposables $3000!<br>  to sterilize used ones just follow the instructions for stripping given by one of the other answerer's the fabric used in them has natural anti microbial properties and really only needs the added boost of a good stripping.<br>  <br>  those disposable users who are running down the cloth system- maybe you should look at what a modern cloth diaper actually is and how much work is involved in them before you mouth off about something that you have not learnt about!|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Take a big pot of water and boil the diapers for about 10 min. Works fine and doesn't affect the fibers as much as bleach.<br>  <br>  After reading previous comments let me add, we have a little store in our town that also sells over the Internet (Jillian's Drawers). They do sell sterilized gently used diapers. I bought several of them and never had any problems with them. And don't let them confuse you, reusable diapers are cheaper than the throwaway diapers.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Nope, I wouldn't do it. I don't hear many good things about cloth diapers, and I believe you have to change them everytime they pee. Even if it's just once. Disposable in the end will cost you just as much as cloth diapers. considering your water bill increase from having to do laundry that much more. Electricity increase form running the washer and dryer more. Plus you would just get sick of washing them. lol.|`|hSJnaysiaa	Yes- its called "stripping" them. You use dish detergent and HOT water. You can find directions online.<br>  <br>  We bought a few used Bumgenius diapers and stripped them.<br>  <br>  Personally though, I'm not that much of a germo-phobe. I mean, my babies butt will touch these diapers, not his mouth. And the diapers were worn by babies before him, so the worst they could have in them is baby poop (but they've all been washed/stripped). And they will have plenty more baby poop in them, so I'm not too worried. Most babies aren't radioactive or anything :)|`|Xu5BtID1aa	If you wash them in hot water in the washing machine, there shouldn't be any problem with them!! Just make sure they aren't REALLY bad!<br>  -cruelsuperset- made a good point with using cloth diapers!!|`|znkumaA1aa	buying used cloth diapers is an environmentally friendly choice x2. No need to sterilize them just pop them in the wash. Nothing harmful that you would ever need to worry about can survive a wash & dry cycle. I've recently inherited 4dzn dsq prefolds from a friend who no longer needs them. They are perfect, used for two years and I'm holding on to them until I have a baby|`|XvJHf9Wuaa	Eww.

ygbhsZ2Zaa	Does your local commiunity center have a gym? Ours has open gym times, and I sometimes grab my kids (the 22 month old loves this) a bouncy ball or two, and use the gymnasium. She loves being in the big open space when it's too cold to be out.<br>  Library? Or even check Barnes and Noble for a story time, many of them have a story time almost every day. <br>  Go buy a cheap shower curtian liner and get some fingerpaints out. Paint it up.

XLQ9wCUaaa	If you're 18 and responsible, and your boyfriend is decent and doesn't smack you around or anything (I'm assuming he's an okay guy) then it's really none of her business, is it? It sounds like you're an adult and you're responsible so I would tell her to buzz off. Do it politely if you still live under her roof, but yah. None of her business.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Some mommies just can't let go of the apron strings.  Also, some parents live vicariously through their children (never a good thing).  Hold your ground.  And be forewarned, her intrusiveness will probably extend into your married life, too.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Just because you turned 18 doesn't mean your parents stopped loving you and wanting to protect you for your own good.

ZDC81VjZaa	I, too, had progressed slowly.  Our OB doctor actually recommended that to speed things up naturally, that we go home and do what we did to get pregnant in the first place.  We didn't get right down to it til the next morning and let me tell you... had my daughter that night.  <br>  <br>    There is something in a man's semen that triggers certain hormones within an expectant mother and if she somehow manages to have an orgasm... natural contractions may get things underway, also.<br>  <br>    It's not for everyone.  If it hurts to much, STOP!  Maybe even change positions if it'll help... like being on all fours or bent over the bed with him entering from behind.  Spooning works, too.<br>  <br>    It this stage of your pregnancy, stimulating your breasts in the shower releases labor inducing hormones, also.  <br>  <br>    Good luck with your birth.  You're almost there!!<br>  <br>  PS... 1 cm and less than 50% effaced the day before I had had her... and 15 hours of labor after that.  She'd been SO worth the wait!!|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I was at 2 centimeters at 35 weeks prego.  The doctor schedule a c-section for the next morning....|`|mTyu7CKoaa	I was 2cm and 25% effaced for 2 weeks before i went into labor (at 40 weeks and 4 days) and was stuck at 2.5 cm for 4 hours before finally getting some progress|`|YP3rEESUaa	well the day b4 I was around 50% effaced, and 3 cm dilated, but I had to be helped along after that, because I was stuck at 3 cm.|`|dbafItLvaa	I wasn't at all.  Had my weekly Dr appt, and no action.  We scheduled an inducement for a week later, but the next day I went into labor!|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I wasn't! It took 3 days of labor before I even started to dilate! :(|`|AA11538461	I have no idea.  I have had four and I was never checked in advance.
1B91qtNQaa	I honestly don't know. With both of my children I did not have an ultrasound until 18-20 weeks.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	Congratulations!<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it. Most docs don't check you until 8 weeks, that's when you can usually see the hearbeat. You have fluid so that is good, the baby is there just too small right now. Also, the week thing isn't an exact science, it can be off by a few days or a week here and there because it doesn't tell you how old the fetus is it just goes off of when your last period was. Who knows when you actually ovulated and then actually conceived because sperm can live 3-4 days in the uterus and tubes before you get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Get the book "Your pregnancy week by week"..it's awesome! It'll show you what the baby is like and doing every week. I loved it.<br>  <br>  And again, congratulations!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I had an ultrasound done around 4 weeks and they couldn't see the baby just the sack. When I went back around 10 weeks they were able to see the baby. The doctor told me that you can start to see the baby at 5 1/2 weeks. Maybe they have your dates wrong. good luck.|`|weadibPeaa	they cant always see the baby at 6 weeks its like the size of a half a grain of rice. When i went in at 6 weeks 2 days...they could only see the sac not the baby. i went back a week later and there was a baby with a heartbeat. Also you couldve ovulated a couple days later than you think and at 6 weeks that couple of days in either direction really makes a difference in what you'll see.|`|kw80YHMLaa	Oh my god some people are so mean, ye should be ashamed if you cant at least be nice then don't answer!! <br>  <br>  Honey everyone is different don't worry everything should be fine, at 6 weeks the baby could be hiding some place in there! most people have different ideas of when a baby can be seen if there is a heartbeat dont worry,  i wish u the best of luck<br>  <br>  Dont pay attention to those losers with bad advice|`|eV7rtxmuaa	If they cant see a sac at 6 weeks Id say your doctor definately has your dates wrong.|`|FTW82Wumaa	Completely normal!<br>  I went in at 5 weeks 1 day and all they saw was a gestational sac and a yolk sac. No baby and certainly no heartbeat.<br>  At 6 weeks 1 day we were able to see a tiny dot of a baby and a flicker of a heartbeat.<br>  But some people aren't able to see it even then. The reason my doctor was concerned was because my HCG levels were pretty high and once they're around 2000-3000 miu/ml, they should be able to see something in there. <br>  It also depends on how up to date and sensitive your doctor's equipment is. <br>  Also, my weeks were wrong. When I had my first appointment I thought I was 7 weeks and the sac measured 5 weeks 1 day. Since then, Everytime I've had an ultrasound, the baby has measured bigger than we thought. I had one at what I thought was barely 8 weeks and I measured 9 weeks. So maybe your little peanut is just growing a little slow like ours was.<br>  Good luck and congrats!!!!!!|`|Ydjk80cJaa	first of all I would like to apologize for peoples rude and insensitive answers!<br>  <br>  Now,<br>  I know you normally can't hear the heartbeat until like 8 or 9 weeks.  As far as seeing the baby I'm not really sure what it could be.  I'm sure everything is fine or your doctor would have been more concerned.  Good luck!! and I will keep you and your baby in my prayers!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Don't worry hun! usually they don't do the u/s till 8 weeks. Its scarry to not see nething yet. I have been there! SO just hang in there!!! 6 weeks is still early and you may have ovulated later than you thought!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!|`|ZdZD1wISaa	They can't see the baby because the average length to give birth is 9 months, so 6 weeks is not enough time for a visible image of your child.<br>  congratulations though|`|g7mD94cuaa	No sometimes you cant see the baby that early. It is normal. I am no doctor though, so you may want to get a second opinion. Congrats though!! :-D|`|r6IRYVRnaa	your baby is really small about the size of a penny right now! At 8 weeks you will hear it. Well Good Luck|`|0J0A7HqCaa	I had a vaginal ultrasound at 8 weeks and you could see the baby very clearly.  You wouldn't be able to hear the heartbeat now though at 6 weeks.  Did they take blood today?  If they did it will show if your HCG is rising normally.  That way they can tell if its a normally pregnancy.  More than likely if you had a pregnancy test come out positive by now, the dates probably wouldn't be wrong.  What did they take a pic of?  What did the ultrasound lady say to you.  You can always tell if somethings up, cause they won't say anything at all.  I'm sure everything is fine, you'll just have to wait a few days.  You should get results back about your HCG and that will tell all.  Good Luck and Congrats!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Sometimes, when you're only 6 weeks along, they are only able to see your fluid and possibly a tiny spot that looks like a kidney bean and sometimes a heartbeat...depending on how good the u/s tech is.  :)  That is totally normal.  They'll probably do another ultrasound in a few weeks when your around 8-10 weeks along, and it'll probably be another transvaginal..  If they don't see anything then, the doctor will explain more in depth of what's going on.  Just don't worry about it for now.  They saw fluid, which is a good thing.  The more you worry and stress, the more problems it puts on your baby.  Good luck! :)|`|7KMOLdcNaa	Sometimes very early in pregnancy, the baby isn't big enough to see on the ultrasound.  The physician said that you have fluid, because your endometrium is thick and preparing for a viable pregnancy.  This is the reason doctors don't recommend early ultrasounds because people tend to think something is wrong, whereas its just a very early pregnancy.|`|w0rXQ4Dgaa	There are several reasons for this.<br>  1. It could be a miscarriage meaning that your body had failed to support the baby. 1 in 6 women will suffer a miscarriage.<br>  2. Your baby could be a dwarf.<br>  3. You should be able to see you baby at 6-8 weeks, so there's still hope.<br>  4. If it is a miscarriage, be warned. They will have to sedate and remove the fluid.<br>  Please don't get scared, there's still hope.<br>  Good luck, I hope your baby is born strong and healthy.|`|P332DU06aa	yes it is fine  my mom is prego 25 more days to go and she could not see the baby like what it was and the head arms feet and stuff like that till she was 4 months|`|5RAQxWtKaa	This isn't going to get a best answer.  But I thought you couldn't really see anything until 8 weeks.  If the doctor isn't worried I wouldn't be either. <br>  <br>  Hope you're doing OK.|`|AiVR7yxXaa	hes probably a baby that's slow at growing, my little bro wasn't visible until 7 weeks, but good luck with Ur baby!|`|UymOzNJtaa	some times this happens its ok dont get to upset ok its normal for this to happen well sometimes i thought that to but it turns out it takes about 8 weeks so dont get all worked up about it.|`|TCzvigiuaa	You might have miscalculated or he/she was hiding...good luck! and best wishes to a healthy baby.
eJMIazhLaa	I think that name is adorable!!! It's not one that you hear all the time and I'm very fond of names like that.  Very cute!

And if she doesn't like it she can always go by Cari or Dee. Love it, love it, love it.  I'm not a big fan of the name Rae though. Maybe Ann, Renee, or Elizabeth.|`|wuqJZUauaa	I like it, however it makes me think of Caridee English  ( <a href="http://l.yimg.com/l/tv/us/img/site/63/11/0000036311_20061207172303.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://l.yimg.com/l/tv/us/img/site/63/11...</a> ) From America's Next Top Model.

Or Carlee Rae Hawthorne.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	Caridee like Carrie Dee or a different pronunciation? I really like the middle name but the first name I'm not too fond of.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	Rae is cute but Caridee is not!<br>  <br>  how about.. <br>  Robin Rae<br>  Lexus Rae<br>  Lindsay Rae<br>  Allie Rae<br>  Amber Rae|`|Ba6SSkzBaa	I like Rae, but i really don't like caridee. Maybe Catherine?|`|v6DRUwH7aa	I really like Rae due to your special meaning behind it.  Caridee...not so much.
S1gJJHNzaa	most of the time yes, you will dry up a few days after O until AF but you really can't go by that...<br>  <br>  14 days after O take a good test with first morning urine.<br>  <br>  good luck!
Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well first off clomid does dry you up which is why most doctors will tell you to use pre-seed so the sperm have a fertile fluid to be in.  It could be too early to tell but also the stress of trying to get pregnant could cause you to be late.

Yi5Rgauoaa	My son is almost three and we have done this since he was tiny. Every morning when I get him up we watch cartoons on Noggin (it is a commercial free kid's channel geared more towards toddlers) so we learn things and he loves the songs. I try to help him interact when there is something to learn. This gives me time to wake up and have some coffee since my son happens to be my alarm clock. I tried getting up before him but it always woke him up and then he was cranky. After cartoons and breakfast we play with his toys for a bit and if the weather is nice we go outside and play for about 30 min. After his nap I let him play by himself. It helps him be independent and  gives me some me time. (And by himself I mean I'm watching him but not participating) I try to make sure I tickle and hold him a lot. Anything involving physical contact. It helps with bonding. If he is being really hyper and I need to wear him out I turn on the children's music station on sirus satellite and we dance our legs off. It helps him burn energy and helps me burn off that pesky baby weight. When he was too little to dance and he was fussy I would set him in my lap with his back on my chest and wiggle to the songs. He thought is was hilarious. Basically I act like a total goofball to entertain him and keep him active. You will find a routine that works for you as you figure out what makes your child happy. No matter how experienced a parent sounds you just have to remember that we are all fumbling around in the dark learning as we go. Nurture, play, teach, love. And of course discipline! be firm and consistent. No one likes a spoiled child and no one enjoys raising one.

AA12253707	Normally when they start trying to crawl out is a good sign. My son was about 2 when he started sleeping in his toddler bed, he had started crawling out around 18 months but we waited a little while longer, looking back he would have been fine in his toddler bed then. Just make sure you leave the door open and an open ear at least until he is use to it.|`|rHoj4coQaa	If he is tall enough to get out would be a number one sign to me. With my daughter she didn't really give off any signs besides the fact that it was getting difficult to lay her in the crib without her waking up. She converted at 18 months. If you'd like i would just try it and see how it works. If it seems like he is not excepting it well then you can just go back to the crib for a month or so and then try again.|`|AA11329531	My children were 1 1/2 when I put them in toddler beds. Signs I knew my children were ready: My children were trying to climb out of their crib, they resisted when i took them to the crib, they did not flip and flop so much in their sleep anymore, they sleep through the night, etc.|`|egN478Bbaa	I put my daughter in a regular bed at about 1 1/2 years.  There wasnt a particular reason, or a certain action she displayed.  It took her about a week and she was good.  Make sure to make it like a character he likes.  She loved dora at the time, so it was all dora!|`|yhrqIjAeaa	My son was about 18 months when we converted the crib to a toddler bed.  He wasn't trying to get out, but I noticed that when he was playing in his crib, he had the strength to pull himself out if he wanted.  The transition went very well, since his toddler bed is in essence the same crib he was sleeping in from infancy.  We bought a bed rail to keep him safe and he's been loving his "big boy" bed ever since!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Whenever he gets tall enough to climb over the edge|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	My daughter was a little over 2 when we converted her crib.  We were getting ready to move and she was potty training so we decided rather than taking the crib apart and putting it back together as a crib...to do the toddler bed.  She was so excited about the conversion!  She stayed in her bed no problems but we put the baby gate up just in case.  My daughter had only climbed out of her crib once or twice but it wasn't a constant battle with her.  Some say when they start climbing out of the crib that's when you should make the conversion...others say when your child starts to potty train that's when you should convert.  Some say 18 months...2 years...3 years...I think the minimum recommended age is 12 months but I honestly don't know.<br>  <br>  We weren't too sure either when we were considering the switch.  Our pediatrician told us it's really a personal decision.  If we, as the parents, feel she's ready...then go for it!  BUT...make sure it's the right choice you're willing to stick with because it will be far too confusing to go from crib to toddler bed and then back to crib if it isn't working as planned.  If you feel he's ready and you are ready for all the pros and cons that come with it...then go for it!

qayCggxMaa	If he's eating a bunch and sleeping a bunch, but otherwise seems ok, then it sounds like it's just a growth spurt.  Those generally last a couple days, then he'll get back to his normal routine.  Enjoy all the extra sleeping while you can.  If he has any other symptoms (fever, congestion, diarrhea, etc.), or if during the time he is awake he never seems to fully wake up and constantly seems lethargic, then you should talk to his doctor.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	this could just be a growth spurt which is completely normal, however if you notice anything else unusual like faint in colour, sickness, fever etc see a doc to rule out anything else:)|`|XvJHf9Wuaa	I'm not an expert but maybe he is growing? Babies sleep a lot when they grow, babies sleep a lot anyway though. I'd take him to a doctor and quick before it progresses into something else.|`|7vRVF6wUaa	He is probably growing.  If he is eating, drinking, pooping & peeing w/ no temp it's probably nothing.  Growing is very hard work!|`|kIpDDVc9aa	He's probably just tired or growing a lot. Give him a few days and if he's still acting strange, then try seeing your pediatrician. He could be sick but you never know.|`|5RAQxWtKaa	Does he have a fever?  I would call the doctor. Go with your instincts, and make an appointment.  He might just be "plugged up" but I would get him checked out.

TCzvigiuaa	True story...same thing happened to me. I was pregnant, but later I had a accident and miscarried. So I would say wait it out or just take a test. I hope this helped you a little, not to worry or scare you. Best wishes!|`|0dx5CMzUaa	periods change sometimes so it could come a week late or early, wait a little while like a week then take a test. unless you're really worried then take one now!|`|r6IRYVRnaa	Take a test|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Just take a test if you think you are pregnant BUT periods can be late...|`|vsuXCMqzaa	Periods can be late. If you have a light discharge, you will probably start soon. But if you are worried, take a test. If it's negative then you are most likely not pregnant. Just wait it out.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I took my pregnancy test the night before i expected my period and it was positive. Throughout the next week i did have a clear discharge that would scare me because it felt like my period but i read up on it and it is a symptom of early pregnancy. Take a HPT and see for sure and if you still are not sure go to the dr and have a blood test. :)|`|0J0A7HqCaa	You could have ovulated late and your period is late.  Before your period there is always discharge.  I'm sure it will come in a few days.  If your really worried you should take a pregnancy test.  If your period is over a week late you should go to the doctors.  Could mean other things.  Next time wear protection.  I can't believe anyone now a days will have unprotected sex with a HUGE change of getting HIV or an STD!|`|3gVPMjURaa	Take a test  period can be late due to meny other reasons|`|nAOlBmzDaa	take a test then
27jdKozNaa	I had my first real boyfriend when I was 15 yrs old  & he was 20. So it's not the exact same thin but kind of. Anyway, Honestly I do think it''s okay if they are both mature enough, but even with maturity, when you have a 22 yr old they can do things a 16 yr old legally cant, so while I feel like yes it is okay (though not ideal) I think they will grow apart from each other due to the gap in ages & what can & cannot be done to to said ages. Also I was a totally different person at 20 then I was at 15 so you more then likely will emotionally grow in different directions too. Im 25 now & my hubby is 38 & we have a beatuiful baby & have been together for almost 6 yrs =)|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I agree with "bynxyta".|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Well, it all depends on the people. When I was 16, I was dating a 23 year old. He was friends with my friends, and probably a little immature for a 23 year old. He never pressured me for sex at all. If they aren't doing anything illegal and the 16 year old is mature, then is it really different than, say, a 26 year old dating a 32 year old?|`|k9VvIG3gaa	In my eyes...no..<br>  The 22 yr old could get in HUGE sh*t if caught...|`|FwJLD1uDaa	the 22yr old could get in trouble - wait 2yrs :)|`|zhrGiQsKaa	as long as your not having sex|`|1ERDjrTTaa	Depending on your state it could be illegal if intercourse is involved. Besides that, I was 16 and dated a 22 year old. I felt pressured and controlled. I ended up getting pregnant at 17, dropping out of high school and having 2 more kids with him. I didn't realize it wasn't love but control until it was too late. I am now divorced with 3 kids, that I would not trade for the world. But it was a hard road to get to where I am now, which is a good place.|`|5gKg5S0vaa	I'm not going to judge because I actually had a 22 year old boyfriend when I was 15!  It's not as bad as it sounds, remember the age of consent is 16 in England.  From personal experience I would recommend being with someone your own age or someone who is closer to it.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	If it's a sexual relationship, then it depends where you live.  Where I live, the age of consent is 16, so it would be ok.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Yes. But you can't have sex for another two years, and I doubt your parents would allow the relationship.<br>  <br>  Wait 2 years.|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Absolutely not. That's just asking for trouble. Maybe when she turns 18.|`|M2yERqNSaa	are you stupid, they only want sex and brag to their friends, where are your parents ?|`|rUPjr7hjaa	No.|`|PumDOQC9aa	No its not okay|`|nfn01Xsfaa	hmm.<br>  <br>  honestly. <br>  <br>  when i was 17, i dated someone who was 23 for a few months.<br>  <br>  i did it because i wanted him to pay for my things. =) haha which he did someitmes.<br>  <br>  just as long as your child or the 16 year old KNOWS and UNDERSTANDS what situation she is in and knows she is in charge of the situation. =)'<br>  <br>  so i think its okay.<br>  <br>  the 22 year odl may be shy or quiet. the 23 year old i dated was introverted. lol. he didnt take advantage of me.|`|haJNjTuUaa	Legally, it depends on your countries laws...Here in Canada, you must be above 16 to date anyone above the age of minority.<br>  Morally, it just depends on the maturity of the people.|`|3jIKpBZ2aa	Hell no!  What the hell is wrong is you?!
PWv3Exi9aa	Honestly- <br>  I don't see a right and a wrong with this one. <br>  <br>  Personally- I decided on my own that I am going to wait to have sex until I am married. I am not in the majority among my college friends, but it's something that is important for me. <br>  <br>  However, I lived in Europe for a year,  and I experienced talking about sex and having sex at a younger age than is typically thought of here in the States. I think it's a good thing to talk about sex at a younger age, like your dad said- he'd rather you be safe. <br>  <br>  As for asking him- I am a girl.. so that would be super awkward for me.. but maybe you can ask him if he could put them somewhere you knew, and could get them.. but if you're ready to have sex, you should be ready to talk about it...|`|TjsH4IEeaa	Both parents are right... your mom is right that you shouldn't be having sex... your dad is right that if you are going to, you should be using protection. You should definitely wait, but if you do indeed get into a situation where sex is involved- any kind, oral or intercourse, you can get condoms from planned parenthood for free, and anonomously. you may want to carry one at all times, because if sex comes up, the last thing u will be thinking is about talking to your dad for a condom...|`|irBBbt0Eaa	First of all, if you're not mature enough to go buy your own condoms, then you aren't mature enough for sex. <br>  <br>  Second, your dad is right that you should know about condoms because just in case, you definitely need to wear one.<br>  <br>  --Exactly!! You're only 15. I lost mine at 14 bud. There was nothing worse in my life than telling the girl i planned to marry about that.|`|o705bFBpaa	if your woried about asking him get a friend to do it if you cant. and beside that your dad told you u could have sex and he has more relation to you than your step mom. my step mom freaked when my dad did the same thing last year but my mom also told me she doesnt care as long as i use condoms. if you feel your mature enough then just go get them and dont tell him.|`|9j2VKjJ0aa	Your dad's right...But I would just buy my own condoms. Your parent should of talked about this situation before talking to you about it. My parents didn't take the right approach when talking to me about sex either... Just be safe if and when you do it. You don't want to have a kid in high school like I did, so use protection. :)|`|jzA1GuZ5aa	well, that is what my older brother told me but my dad heard and freaked, i'm only 14....i think it is good to know that there is someone there if you did decide to have sex...so ypour dads right, just explain to your step-mom that you won't need them(even if it is a lie) and if you do use them it will be the right time....or just kiss her ***|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Your Dad has the right idea, but I think if you are old enough to have sex then you should go to the shop and get them yourself. <br>  <br>  I have done it before...I wasn't even buying them for myself it was someone who didn't want to go in and get them themself....Real mature.|`|qcvjUgHzaa	If you're mature enough to have sex then you should be mature enough to buy condoms yourself!|`|7y5teM7Qaa	I'm with your Dad on this one.|`|fVH6UbsCaa	Yea, I also agree with your dad.|`|WbzdAJgdaa	if your dad felt it was the right time then I agree with him.|`|AFKQuyUFaa	both|`|35rUgoW6aa	your dad was totally in the right here. your step-mom needs to get her head out of the sand. if she really thinks denying you information and contraception is wrong, then she can be the one who raises the baby. i don't know if words can even explain how frustrated that makes me! haha. i hope i can be like your dad when i'm older, and i think it's really cool that you have a relationship like that with him. if you are mature enough to buy condoms without being embarrassed and talk openly about it with your partner, in my book, you're mature enough to have sex. if i were your dad, i'd just buy you a pack of condoms and keep them in your bathroom cabinet, just in case you ever needed them.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I agree with your dad. Your step mom is in denial. Not giving a teen condoms is not going to keep them from having sex.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	im with both of them ... you shouldnt be sexually active ... but your step mom cant control if you have sex or not its your choice And im also with your dad because if you do have sex you dont wanna get a girl pregnant. Me being a girl ... and im not very close with my dad and hes kinda strict i wouldn't wanna ask him for condoms even though he has told me that if i need to any to come to him (hes like your dad in that way) i dont feel comfortable with him knowing if i was sexually active ... im a 14 year old girl and i would probably get a big lecture ... so if i needed them (which i dont becasue im not sexually active) i would go out and buy them myself ... they cant tell you that you cant get them. And if you dont feel comfortable asking your dad then i suggest you get them yourself ... and if the clerk doesn't let you buy them ... just say ... "well would you rather me knock up my girlfriend and get her pregnant?"  if that doesn't do something ... then try a different place where the clerk isn't such a freak LOL good luck =]|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	Your dad is definitely doing the right thing, and I appreciate his attitude towards this and how he's not hiding, like your stepmom. She's one of those parents who think that "If I never mention it and ignore it well enough, it won't happen". Until, of course, you die of a drug overdose or get a girl pregnant. Your dad is a smart man.|`|ki3XY49daa	I have four kids and only ONE of them is a boy and I have to say, I'm with your dad on this one.  It's inevitable that you're going to have sex someday.  No way would I have flipped out about that if my husband said that to my son at 15.  Your stepmom is not in the wrong for getting defensive, but only because it seems she genuinely cares for your well being.  No matter who's right or wrong, just be safe! =)|`|6BAb9eawaa	Your dad is right.|`|gX40pgLyaa	im wit ur dad on dis 1
8WbfmK5daa	Wear more breathable clothes such as cotton and not polyester.<br>  <br>  Some people just naturally sweat more than others but if it is just when she puts clothes on she need to be wearing more breathable fabrics.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	she probably has hyper-hydrosis<br>  there is a procedure where they inject botox into your armpits to control sweating, if you ever want to go for that<br>  for now i would try clinical strength, which works somewhat,  or even men's deodorant|`|GXM74MGPaa	Shell probably need botox injections. You need to take her to the doctors.|`|sqR0iyuWaa	Some pit stains are caused by the antiperspirant itself! Try a different active ingredient. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_zirconium_tetrachlorohydrex_gly#Clothing_stains" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum_zi...</a><br>  <br>  Otherwise, you could talk to a dermatologist for prescription strength antiperspirant.<br>  <br>  Research has been pretty inconclusive as to the cancer risk associated with antiperspirants. Maybe it's harmless, maybe not. So whatever you're comfortable with.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I would take her to the doctors and ask their opinion. Some people suffer from excess sweating, which is not linked to overheating, cleanliness, or physical exercises. They can give you stuff for it, or even in extreme cases, they can inject botox into your sweat glands, which stops the excess sweating.<br>  <br>  I had trouble with this when I was younger, and I actually found some deodorant called Maxim on the internet. It actually stopped me sweating from my armpits altogether. But I would ask her doctors advice first.|`|JwnHKTabaa	I use men's deorderant. It works great. :)|`|8hgrkiK5aa	i am like that also, she just sweats a lot and it's hell to deal with especially in school. there are tips to lessen it. as soon as you get out of the shower, dry off you underarms first then put on deo. then dry off the rest of your body. never use wet deo like the roll ons that Just makes it worse. leave a little time after you put on your deo to Just hold your arms up for about a minute. you can use baby powder or baking soda to reduce the sweating. i thought i would grow out of it when i finished puberty but im 19 and i still have it so it's Just something she is going to have to deal with for the rest of her life like i am. i heard some people get botox to reduce sweating but i don't think it's that serious.|`|AEyztU2laa	I suggest taking her to a doctor.  Excessive sweating can be caused by a variety of things - low blood sugar (often due to diabetes), hyperthyroidism, some tumours, obesity or just bad genes as far as sweating goes.<br>  <br>  There are many medical ways to treat it from oral medications to surgery to botox injections however it's best to rule out any other health problems before resorting to them.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I have the same problem and I use Mitchum Mens deodorant and it works pretty well. <br>  Or you could do the botox thing but it's very pricey and painful. <br>  <br>  Also, if she's 14 she's not a toddler so you put this in the wrong section :)|`|65RZ441Zaa	My cousin had this problem growing up. Her mom would make her wear mans antiperspirant, BUT I think she went to her family doctor and she was prescribed something. Also that was the original use of botox, to stop sweating profusely|`|H3Va1OKqaa	Your questoin about your 14 year old daughter goes in the toddler/preschool section?<br>  <br>  You should probably talk to a dermatologist, or buying thinner clothing.|`|AA10469101	Is she wearing natural fibers like cotton, or synthetics?  Make sure her clothes breathe.
BUOJJpaCaa	Could be herpes. You should go to the OB/GYN and get checked out. If you don't have one, go to planned parenthood.<br>  <br>  Even if it is just chafing, you might have some internal lacerations if the sex was that hard and rough.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	STD - better see a doctor and quit fooling around with strangers.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	STD.<br>  Go to the doctors, and see.<br>  <br>  Next time use a condom??|`|80b2d9dd1b346a0b0eaa4df0197bee14aa	Just  because he has not had sex in over a year does not mean that he does not have anything. Best thing to do it go get checked.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	It might just be chaffed, but I would go the your gyno just to get it checked out, because you never know. Hopefully he wore a condom|`|06O8FaOjaa	LOOKS LYK YU NEED TO GO CHECK IT OUT CUZ IT LOOKS LYK AN STD|`|IH0kLuwZaa	was he wearing a condom? <br>  if so it could be an allergic reaction to the latex or the lubricate on the condom either way it goes you should go to the doctor or a clinic and get some kind of medication and checked just in case. just because he looks healhty and clean and told you that doesn't mean its true was he tested in the last six months if not he can't be sure and i know that sucks
