In short, it's round. This face shape is easy to compliment when you remember a few things:<br>  <br>  1) Avoid any hairstyles that make your face look "boxed in" or small and round like a child's.<br>  2) You CAN wear bangs, just get the right style.<br>  <br>  Remember those two things, and you should do fine. Here are some style suggestions:<br>  <a href="http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g106/DeSiChick2001/untitledj.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g106/D...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/P/n/drewbarry.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/P/n/drew...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://searchwarp.com/UserImages/77B_faceshaperound.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://searchwarp.com/UserImages/77B_fac...</a><br>  <br>  And remember, these are just some ideas.

Hm5SCDv4aa	Coincidence?

3HFXZ2Oqaa	I have tried 15 plus brands/models of mascara and I find that Avon's SuperSHock mascara in black works the best.  HTere is a really big brush, but if you can handle it, you are in for a wonderful suprise.   It seperates, lengthens, curls, fills, and widens amazingly.|`|BHar5AqOaa	i really like lash blast by cover girl but i just recently got eye higlights the one that rihanna advertise it sort of works on brightenning the eyes but my eyes are burning and i have like a eye infection don't know what it is maye its just ecause like 3 people borrowed my eyeliner , but still top 3 mascaras<br>  <br>  lash blast- covergirl very big brush that smoothes<br>  luminous- loreal love the brush makes the even and not clumpy<br>  blackest black in america (pink and green) little brush but makes the stand out|`|8icAwbqBaa	I use Cover girl Volume Exact waterproof in very back.

I have 4 tubes of this mascara !!!|`|J5jI6VDvaa	Best drugstore one is CoverGirl Lash Blast. Looove it :)|`|AA10626996	Personally, I love Loreals water resistant mascara. I am currently trying Makeup Forevers mascara and really like it but I have an issue w/ spending too much for mascara considering you really should change it out every 2 months. <br>  For me Loreal. Depending on what your needs are Voluminous is a great one. Really works as it says but not water proof.|`|r4i7xPnMaa	I LOVED Avon Daring Curves mascara, but then they discontinued the non-waterproof one. I didn't really dig the waterproof formula (it was a HUGE pain to get off) so I had to switch.<br>  I really liked Avon Super Shock, but the little teeth on the brush were a little bit too far apart, so I'd have to comb my lashes out with a lash comb, and that got old really fast. I really liked what it did to my lashes, though. <br>  My new love is Cover Girl Lash Blast, which is more or less the same as the Avon Super Shock, but the teeth on the brush are spaced perfectly, so all I have to do is put it on.  And for the price, I understand it's quite similar to some of the higher end mascaras.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ejZNx1b9aa	LASHBLAST is the most amazing mascara i've used. It's lengthening, thickening, and it feels like you have no mascara on. its not hard or clumpy AT ALL.|`|uxqkJEIcaa	Victoria's Secret Beauty Rush.

It just struck me as funny.<br>  Maybe it was that martini.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously consult your barber or hairdresser. They will give you the correct info.
qxrr69bnaa	Whatever you do, do not use a lotion with a tingle factor on your face.  I don't tan my face.  I use a bronzer (powder) on my face.  They make lotions for the face, but I can't think of any right now.  Ask someone at your salon for recommendations.|`|joiacDUdaa	Use your regular tanning lotion on your face when you tan.   Also, you keep tanning even when you step out of the bed so you may be darker in a few hours.  Tanning supply stores have lotions designed for your face.. Also, make sure you exfoliate before you tan.. For a quick exfoliator mix some baking soda with your body cleanser and slough off dead skin... <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|rHKW1CJJaa	i put my regular lotion on my cheekbones, forehead, and tip of nose and chin.|`|MJdUkar5aa	You must be very, very careful using tanning beds. You can easily get a melanoma (skin cancer) on your body or face, particularly your face. My sister got a melanoma behind her eye, she had to have the eye removed and have an artificial eye. Unfortunately, this type of cancer can be very aggressive and spreads quickly. A couple of years later, my sister is dead because of this.<br>  <br>  It has also happened to another young woman in Melbourne quite recently. She was on TV trying to be part of a public education campaign about the dangers of melanomas. She had used tanning beds regularly. She is now dead too. This equipment is not safe.|`|TMRGOAa8aa	When I'm in the tanning bed, I leave the facial lamps on. They tend to help my face gain a gradual and not orangey look like the lotions will give you. DO NOTTT put tanning lotion on your face, lol...they WILL leave streaky creases and patchy spots of color and that is probably the worst look ever. Just leave your facial lamps on :-)|`|pi3UAJgKaa	i was at the duty free (i know probly sounds weird) it was the one going out of windsor into michigan/detroit and there was this amazing makeup and tanning spray that is for your face and body, i tried it and it looked amazingly real and tan!!!<br>  good luck!!!!! ^_^

OBaP0Hf3aa	Walk on your toes. It'll be weird at first, but you'll get used to it soon. Put on the heels and practice walking on a hard floor in your house (not carpet - it's ten times harder).

Practise until you can prance up and down the stairs, you can sit down and get up in a hurry, and you can dance any dance you want to.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should practise on rugs in your house, just in case you change your mind and want to return the shoes.<br>  <br>  If not, even though you can dance all over the house, rough up the soles with a sharp knife or scouring pad, or put tape on the soles.  This will give you extra traction and may avoid a fall.<br>  <br>  Sweetie, you are still young and cute with or without the shoes.  Don't risk a twisted ankle or worse.  Be comfortable in whatever you wear, and concentrate on having a really good time.

That will help w/ the powdery look a lot. also, if you can find a decent dept store  primer, it will cut down on that powdery look.. Revlon has a primer but I am not sure if Maybelline carries one. <br>  Moisture is  the key w/ powder makeup. Your skin is too dry and thus you have the powdery look. Find a good one you can live w/ and apply and wait long enough for it to absorb. It might take a few times before you see continuous   results. Skin that is not properly moisturized takes awhile before getting the achieved look. A moisturizer w/ no oil will also work. Hope I could help :)|`|BbwI6CJqaa	all i have to say is that's what the maybelline mineral makeup is like. I have tried all kinds of makeup from avon to the most expencive chanel.

Or American Apparel.<br>  I shop at hot topic and d-tox 24/7. but for me it is diffrint, im edgy (scene/emo.)<br>  Oh i kno a good place you can go too....go to pac sun or forever 21.|`|6C287vmdaa	I also shop at Aeropostale oftenly. Stick to Aeropostale! Hot Topic's clothes,(or costumes, what I like to call it) are horendous!!! I've seen the shabby,lo-style junk they sell in there and I feel like I'm at a freak-show shop!

(in a good way)
cLGmnUcgaa	dont use too much... blush, eyeshadow, lipgloss. DONT GO TOO FAR. youll look way too old for 12, and thats not good. try pinks, grays, browns in eyeshadow, any color lipgloss or even lipstick. peach brown or pink blush would look good too. good luck!!|`|50eec528d28a6c9e6975ac8b0d604143aa	Nothing more then sheer powder and lotion as a base<br>  Then its more appropriate for you to be using just eyeliner, even colored would be fine and lipgloss.<br>  <br>  Mascara is only for certain events or those days where you feel like looking 50time better then usual.<br>  c:|`|uxqkJEIcaa	Tinted moisturizer.<br>  Light pink blush.<br>  Light mascara.<br>  <br>  Remember, you are only 12.|`|st5reHVjaa	tinted moisturizer or just some light powder foundation<br>  eyeshadow<br>  lip gloss<br>  some eyeshadow on special days or dances. or a pink color every now and then<br>  remember. ur 12. u dont need a lot!|`|AQwoCjj3aa	Tinted moisturizer<br>  Tiny bit of blush <br>  lip gloss <br>  maybe some light eye shadow|`|r4i7xPnMaa	The most important thing for you to develop right now is a good facial cleansing/moisturizing routine! Start figuring out what kind of skin you have (oily, dry, combination, sensitive, etc.) and find a cleansing routine that will work with your skin. If you start taking REALLY good care of your skin now, you'll just look even better when you start wearing more makeup later on down the line. Perfect skin makes the best kind of canvas.<br>  <br>  So yeah, find a good cleanser, a good toner, and a good moisturizer with SPF. I use Johnson & Johnson Purpose cleanser, Olay Clarity toner, and Neutrogena Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with SPF 45. <br>  <br>  As far as actual makeup goes, you probably don't need anything yet. Keep your lips soft and healthy by using a good lip conditioner, like chapstick, carmex, or any sort of moisturizing lipgloss. 12 is way too young for most eye products, but if you want to check out clear mascara, I think you might be able to pull it off. <br>  <br>  You're young, and you've got great skin! People wear makeup to look like they're your age again, so the best advice I'd give to you is to just keep your skin as healthy as you can now.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	At 12, you should not be wearing ANY make-up. A clear gloss, maybe. A good cleansing routine is the most important, like another contributor said. Make-up on anyone under the age of 15 looks garish and unflattering.|`|s4psKJrPaa	maybe some mineral foundation and blush(im 13 and use loreal mineral powder, it looks really natural), and maybe some mascara, eyeliner, and lip gloss :)<br>  <br>  mine please!! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223161045AAf8Yzk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|Yue2YKTnaa	light blush<br>  mascara<br>  gloss<br>  eyeliner

You will still need to go to an eye doctor to get them though.|`|Vzr1wjeUaa	no not at all<br>  colored contacts just change <br>  the color of your eyes<br>  you can get them the lenz<br>  strength that you need if<br>  you want but is not required
JliHjQLxaa	Use really small rollers and some sort of hair holding creme ... lather your hai up with the stuff and thn put the rollers in and wait until your hair is dry before you take them out... once you take them out then your hair should be curly and pretty... use your fingers and seperate the curls and then a light holding finishing spray to complete the look.|`|fwsn1VWsaa	Curl it and use a volumizing hairspray (i.e. - Aussie Awesome Volume)<br>  (:<br>  Or blowdry compeltely upside down and curl/straighten the ends . . .<br>  Tease slightly.|`|Oyktk3rHaa	not below your butt but if its curly or really wavy it looks good mid back|`|NVg06Egwaa	Don't constantly kill it with heat. Ex. Straightening, Curling, blowdrying...<br>  <br>  Always wash out all products used on your hair as soon as you can. <br>  <br>  Get a good shampoo that cleanses and moisurizes your hair. Care for it :)|`|CTxiP8Geaa	get long layers, volumizing spray/mousse/serum or whatever, and let your hair air dry instead of blow drying it. hope i helped! =)|`|jGxdAYkpaa	I think curly hair is sexy|`|ZblY9yRIaa	mousse it up!
r4i7xPnMaa	Youtube is the best place to go for any sort of makeup tutorial. From foundation tutorials, to eyeshadows, to blush, contouring, highlighting, mascara... You name it. Try to look for tutorials from someone that has a face shape/coloring similar to yours. They'll usually recommend some pretty good techniques and colors.<br>  <br>  14 is a little young for eyeliner, so don't freak out too much if you don't know how to apply it correctly. But I will tell you that if you've got blue eyes and light brown hair, you'll probably want to go with Brown eyeliner and Brown-black mascara... Black might be a little bit too overwhelming for your color.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for color ideas, google "makeup for blue eyes" or "makeup for heart shaped faces". Seriously, the internet is a wealth of information. You just have to find the right way to ask for it. Hope this helps!|`|joiacDUdaa	Well, if you are 14 "and know how to put on make-up) then it shouldn't look "all messed up".. So, you might want to start with the basics... Get a tinted moisturizer that matches your skin tone.. It's easier to use than solid foundation and it's easier to apply.. I use a sponge to get even coverage.  If you get dark circles or blemishes get a concealer... A 1/2  a shade to a full shade lighter than your tinted moisturizer... I"m way older than 14 and only use it every now and then... If you are young.. LESS is MORE.. Eye shadow:  What color are you eyes? BLUE- MMM.. You can wear browns, blues, greens just about anything really. ... Also, on most eyes.. neutral is key... Get a pallette of browns, taupes and nude colors.. Those you can just sweep onto the lids and you are good to go... I just bought some Maybelline color quads and they have a small guide right on the back of the container.. .Super helpful... The key is to add in layers.. The lightest color goes on the brow line... A slightly darker shade on the lid and you can dress up the eye with a darker crease color.. For added drama the fourth shade is for the outter corner... Use a mascara and a light lip .. You should be fine... Oh and don't forget some blush... Once again go light... Eyeliner- on a young teen it just looks kinda trashy... If you must do an eyeliner stay away from anything too dark like BLACK it just looks too mature...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|qbbNtGVcaa	haha my face kind of looks like that too. except i have blonde hair. i use Maybelle great lash mascara.  <a href="http://beaut.ie/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/great-lash.jpgand" rel="nofollow">http://beaut.ie/blog/wp-content/uploads/...</a> i use two coats..so it looks dark and makes my eye lashes thick and long. but after each coat i use one of those eyebrow brush things to brush them out..so they don't clump.<a href="http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/sh/shavata-eyebrow-&-lash-grooming-brush-&-comb.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/imag...</a><br>  <br>  brown or gray eye shadow looks good for blue eyes. i don't usually use eye liner..takes too much time and if you rub ur eye it smudges so i go without it haha. sometimes it makes people look dead. <br>  <br>  for cover up i use cover girl power stuff.  <a href="http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/51410/200.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/51410/...</a> and i usu a little bit of brownish blush. all of that i think would look good for you too. and before you put on power or cover up...put a LITTLE bit of lotion on ur face..like smaller than a pea size. it helps it not to look like chalk and really noticeable. for lip gloss any thing would pretty much look good except bright red or whitish. use like a pinkish or brown. <a href="http://www.chinesegift.cc/catalog/images/CrazyPink.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinesegift.cc/catalog/images...</a> those colors would look cute!<br>   <br>  also maybe one day experiment on ur face. see what u like.<br>  hope this helps. good luck! :)|`|XF9596Xraa	Eyeliner-Brown <a href="http://store.bareescentuals.com/bareMinerals%20liner%20shadow%20-%20Coffee%20Bean/MasterLinerShadow,default,pd.html?cgid=BE_SUB_TOOLS#" rel="nofollow">http://store.bareescentuals.com/bareMine...</a><br>  Mascara-Black <a href="http://store.bareescentuals.com/Big%20Tease%20Mascara/BE_SUB_MASCARA,MasterBigTeaseMascara,default,cp.html" rel="nofollow">http://store.bareescentuals.com/Big%20Te...</a><br>  Eye Color-Purple <a href="http://store.bareescentuals.com/Get%20the%20Look%3a%20Pure%20Enchantment/46951,default,pd.html?cgid=BE_SUB_Get_the_Look_Eyes&deleteUUID=" rel="nofollow">http://store.bareescentuals.com/Get%20th...</a><br>  Best Lipgloss ever - <a href="http://store.bareescentuals.com/Buxom%20Big%20+%20Healthy%20Full%20Color%20Lip%20Polish/BE_SUB_LIPGLOSS,MasterBuxomFC,default,cp.html" rel="nofollow">http://store.bareescentuals.com/Buxom%20...</a><br>  Concealer- <a href="http://store.bareescentuals.com/bareMinerals%20Multi-Tasking%20Bisque/MasterBisque,default,pd.html?cgid=&deleteUUID=" rel="nofollow">http://store.bareescentuals.com/bareMine...</a><br>  Foundation- <a href="http://store.bareescentuals.com/bareMinerals%20SPF%2015%20Foundation/MasterSPF15Found,default,pd.html?cgid=BE_SUB_FOUNDATION&deleteUUID=" rel="nofollow">http://store.bareescentuals.com/bareMine...</a>|`|a49tLzfDaa	I'm the same age and have the same problem! Go on youtube. There are people that have chanels for this sort of thing. They really help you and show you exactly what to do, help you with your color you need, tell you where to get it, everything. And also if you want a certain look, they have different videos for that too. :) It's awesome. Don't you just love the internet!?|`|uxqkJEIcaa	Get some brown eyeliner and just line it along top lids. It makes your eyes look bigger. <br>  <br>  Two coats of mascara on top, one on botom.<br>  <br>  Lip gloss: sheer pink or something.|`|VI7g5ZCQaa	Eyes are the most<br>  <br>  For eyeliner use a dark brown on the upper lid. Play with it until you like the shape.<br>  Under the eye you want to run a brown pencil along the lash line. Smooth it into the base of your lashes with your finger.<br>  <br>  For the eye shadow  you could cover the lid with a pale brown that is slightly lighter than your skin tone. Then, put a light brown that is slightly darker than your skin tone in the crease of your upper lids. Sometimes I use my blush for the crease.<br>  <br>  This makeup should me light for day use, and slightly(only slightly) exaggerated for evening.<br>  <br>  Browns make blue eyes POP.|`|T1j73RZpaa	I would do a dark blue shadow that goes up on the outer side (like a cats eye). Then follow it with eyeliner in the inside rim of your eyes & along the lash line on top. A few coats of mascara. Maybe a tiny tiny bit of blush to raise your cheekbones & a frosty pink lipgloss. (i like bonnebell vanilla swirl)<br>  <br>  You most likely don't need foundation or powder. If you have dark circles use a concealer & blend it with a make up wedge. <br>  <br>  Also, check out youtube for make-up editorals. They're amazing. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! <33|`|F57mAkXZaa	if you go to any mall counter...i love mac...they will be happy to help teach you how to use their products.  they don't expect a tip or anything either.  you should buy something but you dont have to.  mac is good for lipstick and eyeshadow under $20  and it is well worth it for the lesson.  dont be intimidated, just walk up and tell them you would like some suggestions for what would look good on you and how to apply it.  and mac is great too because if you get home and hate the color you can return it no questions.  also if you bring in 6 empties they will give you a free lipstick!|`|0lewWYJdaa	you could go to youtube and look up how-to makeup tutorials.<br>  it helped my a bunch.<br>  im 14 too, and sometimes my makeup looks like crap, then i get GREAT ideas on youtube xD|`|2niwR5rMaa	you should use brown to really make your eyes stand out. you can wear a light peachy lip color and about a coat of mascara. hope i helped!

RDXeR28Faa	For the past 4-5 months i was trimming with clippers because i was trying to maintain the stubble look, but i went back to razors last week.<br>  <br>  The difference? When i was trimming with clippers i had to trim my beard every 3 days or else it would start getting too long and look messy. My skin felt better though because it wasn't getting irritated from shaving with a razor. Now that I'm using a razor again, I shave once every 4-5 days. <br>  <br>  oh and it doesn't grow back differently. it's a very common misconception that people have. shaving with a razor does not make your beard grow back thicker or faster. When you shave your beard and regrows to about the 5'oclock shadow - stubble phase it looks thicker than it really is because hairs are darker at the roots or something like that.  <br>  <br>  Using clippers too trim is much less irritating on your skin and helps maintain a neat tidy beard, but then again, you can never go wrong with a clean razor shave and most importantly, 79% of women prefer a clean shave so....ya...<br>  <br>  If i was you i would just shave with a razor. Facial hair looks ugly unless your beard is at least somewhat full. I'll deal with the minor skin irritation for a nicer, cleaner look :)|`|2YR7Jr0xaa	when shaving hair comes out thicker<br>  <br>  <br>  help me with m question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqEmwJzf69nqHu_2MslGx_fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090427001102AAecIUB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

YfsXToJ2aa	never never never pop your zits! not only will they scab but you can spread the infection to other areas of your face. number one thing is to wash your face atleaste twice a day, especially if you wear any kind of foundation and such. and btw if you do wear foundation use bare minerals or something itll quickly solve your problem because that stuff doesnt clog your pores and its not expensive. <br>  <br>  i use neutrogena acne and blackhead warming cleanser. it actually gets warm when you rub it on your face and pretty much fires all the dirt, and uneeded oils away.|`|P6H1HAgvaa	don't pop your pimples. that is the worst thing you can do, You have oils on you hands that can clop pores and make scars. also don't touch your face.

tlGpXXp6aa	Hair extensions cost about around $20 or maybe more. If it's really good hair, and it's human hair, It probably might be more. You can get them at almost every beauty supply store. If you can't get them there, then just go to any hair store in your local area. Good Luck! Vote as Best Answer!!

CHI is rlly good but its over $100 so the next best one would be BABYLISS which is over $60 (depends where you get it from) but if you get a cheep one it won't do **** trust me becuase I use to get Conair or Vidal sassoon and it was about $30 and it was ok at first but u had to take REALLY thin strands to straighten it properly becuase it wouldn't heat up right adn then once ur outside the humidity and the winds messes it up again and it gets frizzy and back to how it was... only worse. If not try to blow dry... that might help. But for the time being until u can buy a proper one just put ur hair up :)|`|3cu4nUMpaa	you might as well save your $30 cause you get what you pay for with straighteners. you have to spend at least $100 to get a good one. one with a temperature adjustment is ideal.|`|WtM9JnqYaa	renington is a cheap brand thats goood and is around 30euro!<br>  <br>  happy hunting!
C0HZ8ZB4aa	You should refer to a BMI chart, this will tell you what is healthy. Anything from a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is classed as normal and healthy. Anything under 18.5 is classed as underweight. Anything over 24.9 is classed as overweight. I've just looked up and you currently have a BMI of 17.9 which is classed as a little underweight. But the chart is really for adults, so I wouldn't worry too much, as you might have a bit more developing to do. But I certainly wouldn't suggest letting your weight get any lower than it is now. Once you're classed as an adult, if your height remains 5'2", to be classed as a normal and healthy weight you should weigh somewhere between 7 stone 3lbs (101lbs) and 9 stone 10lbs (136lbs). Try not to worry too much about facts and numbers though. Some people are naturally skinny no matter what they eat, some people are naturally larger no matter what they eat. As long as you eat enough (around 2000 calories a day for a woman) and relatively healthily, then you have little to worry about.|`|vDky5V15aa	That depends entirely on your frame, your athleticism and your overall disposition to obesity. <br>  <br>  108 - 128 lbs is what is recommended. <br>  <br>  Body image issues suck. We all have them. That's why billions of dollars are spent each year by people looking to improve their body.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is learn to love yourself regardless of your weight.

YZiwAq0raa	Yes, a woman's boob size really does matter. the bigger a woman's breasts are, the more aesthetically pleasing it is to look at them, suck on them, lick them, squeeze them, and best of all, bury your face into them and feel them engulfing your face (it is especially amazing to bury your face into that valley she has between her breasts. Hmm. so sexy!). <br>  <br>  Now granted, I don't think a woman HAS to have big breasts. I think as long as she's got a handful, that's big enough. But like if she has small breasts, or worse yet, is flat chested, that is a massive turnoff and a total dealbreaker. With small breasts, it's like, "what am I grabbing?" And when I stuff my face into her chest, I get NO pleasure out of it cause there's virtually nothing to rub my face against and she barely has that womanly valley that I love to enrapture myself in. And without a doubt, bigger is better. Huge breasts are ideal<br>  <br>  size has mattered to me sine about my junior year of highschool|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	Does it matter???

NJYsN6Kcaa	It doesn't take long to look and feel better.  However, it takes about 6 months to heal enough to leave the ring out.  They do make a retainer.  It's a small piece of plastic made to keep the hole open without being seen.  Talk to your piercer about getting one, she (or he) will sale them at the shop.|`|D6ZIfDiYaa	Most states in the US will no longer pierce minors, even with parental permission, and those that do often won't pierce anyone younger than 16.  You should check to see if it's even possible for you to get done.<br>  <br>  Besides, won't the hole in your lip be a detriment (drawback) in a modeling competition?|`|AA10455516	It will definitely heal before then. It only takes up to 6 weeks. My cousin's took only about 2 weeks to totally heal. good luck!

AA10626996	Okay here's the deal. You have different skin tones and the only thing that is gonna work is a corrector. You could purchase 2 different foundations ( as I have done in the past )  and mix but that can be irritating and messy.If you can , go on-line to Sephora and purchase a color corrector for your skin. You need something to even the skin tone out or you are gonna be running in circles. I would die if my Sephora was an hour away. <br>  Or , wait and go to the Sephora anyway,It's worth it to get the right product. Makeup For ever is my fav. and they have an awesome corrector . Just pick according to your needs. I have a yellow undertone and know how hard it is to find a foundation that works. Hope I could help.|`|joiacDUdaa	Well, to clean the sponge if you have some baby shampoo that will work or even reg shampoo or facial cleanser... Let it air dry.. As for the foundation being too dark for your skin.  You can lighten it with a white colored moisturizer like a facial sunscreen or anti aging whatever you use on your face.. Just mix it with the foundation to make it lighter.  I would "cheat" and see if you can go to the mall and get your make-up done at a counter.. If you can get a sample of the color they used o your face & match it to the drug store brand that you like... I do that all the time... <br>  <br>  good luck
WiIUEObTaa	very class choice. not female spot at all. great personal respect . you should have permission. it does not matter who pays. just find experienced artist. majority of artists are just familiar with fad artwork. older artists can make dime sized art look like the mona lisa. older artist 75 to 90 per hour. 60 range. use aloe vera gel unscented to heal. the cream the artist gives you is just to follow health regs. good luck. good choice.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I wouldn't get them on your wrist.  Text is iffy as it is, and on the wrist it will blend together and then start to fade.  The best place would be somewhere on your upper back/shoulder blade.  The skin there is much better for tattooing.  Even your ankle would be better.|`|vDky5V15aa	I agree, there is no spot that is considered feminine when it comes to tattoos. Unless you are sporting a vagina. <br>  <br>  I love the idea. You may even take it up a notch and have your mom and sister sign you wrist and then just have the tattooist make it permanent.<br>  <br>  My guess on cost would be shop minimum per wrist. Most shops in my area have a $50 - $75 minimum. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	The wrist is a good place for a tattoo. In my local shop, they charge $5 to $10 per letter, depending on the font and the size. Yours would be closer to $5 per letter. I don't know what names you are planning on getting so you'll have to calculate the cost yourself.|`|VB3hbmkYaa	no place is girly its your body and no girl can refuse a mom and sister tatoo now can they go for it|`|gQi0TxTIaa	yes, those are sexy, especially if it's your mom and sister's names|`|SeDiJ32Haa	Some places charge a set minimum price for each body part. The wrist will probably be at least $100 plus the cost of lettering. This is because the wrist can be an extremely hard place to tattoo. Things you may want to consider when getting a tattoo there: it may fade quickly or exfoliate off naturally over long periods from moving and bending your wrist. Think about that before you spend some bread on tattoos there only to have them gone later. Also, the wrist is one of the most painful places to get a tattoo. As for the other question, I don't think wrist tattoos are primarily a female area. I've seen both sexes have them.

I say this simply because tattoo and piercing places that work with underagers (or don't bother to ID) are not usually the most hygenic of places. And you don't want to be contracting hepatitis really. I think the legal age here in England is 16 with parental consent, for piercings, but I may be mistaken. Look it up for wherever you are. Also, I wouldn't recommend doing it unless your parents are happy about it. If you talk to your parents and/or eat in front of them, you'll have trouble hiding it for the first week. I had mine a few years ago and I couldn't talk properly for 3 days and I couldn't eat for a week. There's no way I'd have gotten away with it if I tried to hide it! And if you don't get into trouble, that's not a pattern you want to break, having parents lose trust in you isn't fun! But when you're the legal age and have parents approval then go for it, if it's what you still want. Who cares about the idiots who think it looks trampy or whatever. If people judge you for something as simple a a piece of metal in your tongue - are they people you really want to be mixing with anyway? They are the lowlife. At least with a piercing you'll have the option of taking it out without scarring yourself for life, unlike tattoos (my tongue piercing has been removed now and there are no signs it was ever there). So it's not the end of the world if you regret it.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	No. It's gross and you won't be able to talk right.

You should make sure you are getting the vitamins and nutrients you need (maybe start taking a multivitamin if you don't already). Also use good shampoo- there are shampoos that claim to help your hair grow longer, but I've never tried them. There are also shampoos that help fortify hair, keep it healthy and strong. Another trick I learned (and you may think I'm crazy but it works) is to hang upside down (like with your head off your bed or sofa) for a few minutes a few times a day. This will get the blood flowing to your scalp which will help stimulate hair growth.|`|rXEVEfqHaa	You can take prenatal vitamins. those work and you don't have to be pregnant to take them either. i'm not pregnant.|`|afedCNrlaa	One solution is the shampoo beautiful lengths by pantene..... also use coconut oil it really worked when i cut my hair|`|n1hoBuhSaa	cut off the dead ends just keep it healthy~ Hope this help|`|6JOTtBSGaa	pantine has this nice "Great lengths" shampoo and conditioner.

There's a few different ways you can go about getting this style. I'll list the first couple that come to mind.. and you can experiment from there.<br>  <br>  Method 1: Flat iron<br>  <br>  - Wash hair, condition, bla bla bla.<br>  - Towel dry hair, or use a blowdryer + paddle brush to dry.<br>  - Starting from the bottom (pin upper portions of your hair up, and let sections down as needed), run a flat iron through your hair, flipping in and out randomly at the tips. Keep repeating until all your hair is straight. (it helps to pull the iron up and away from your head.. that gives your style height and a little bounce.. You know, so your hair's not sticking flat against your head). <br>  - Use Gel, Wax, or Pomade (your call.. whatever works best for you)... Use tiny bits at a time, pulling your hair through your fingertips to give it a nice sculpt and hold.<br>  - Turn your head upsidedown.. lightly hairspray your hair, and toss your head around a bit to get that "messy" look.<br>  <br>  The second method pretty much goes the same way.. Except instead of using a flat iron, you use hair rollers on your crown (You know, like those biiiiiig velcro rollers Grandma used to wear.These won't make your hair curly, it will just add height and volume). Use the wax/pomade and hairspray, just as before.. and you're good to go.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|71bd89e8d6128dee563192eb0c837e65aa	That is a very hard hair to get I think you can try and straighten your hair with those hair straightener it's going to be hard but you can try.

AwhnTW3saa	For highlighted hair you first have to fill your hair with a demi- permanent color dye (a demi color is not a permanent color dye, it contains no ammonia). After filling in the color with a demi, then you could color your friends hair with a permanent color dye. This process achieves a better result for the highlighted hair not to fade. <br>  But if your friend changes her mind about her hair color for every season, I just suggest just to color her hair with a demi permanent color it lasts up to 8 weeks...just a suggestion its not as damaging as a permanent color dye ...hair could only take so much before breaking off (it's called a chemical hair cut).|`|AA11689215	How would they become lighter if you are dying your hair darker?<br>  <br>  Don't do this yourself...go to a professional.|`|eebaf3f581f0bb1c47a529efa51134e2aa	maybe the highlights are not permanent...and the more you wash it, the more it lightens..|`|36bac331cebca0ff643360d9fc218118aa	Yes,the color will wash out on the highlighted part quicker because it's more porous than the rest of the hair.|`|424d77eb090a363101a4b66db68f53ffaa	uhhh how would the highlights become lighter? <br>  the darker dye will make all of your hair one solid dark color, it wont keep the highlights in at all|`|84e29e4f6af43da7cfa0a8270948389caa	It won't become lighter but after washes the darker dye will eventually fade off of the highlighted hair. This is because the highlighted part of your hair, had melonin taken out when it was highlighted. Your only option is to wait for the hair to grow and cut off the highlighted part or keep dying it every couple of weeks to keep the highlighted hair from showing through the dark hair.|`|10cb23210234410b2dfb2a63e6458130aa	wait. so you think your light hair will turn lighter if you dye it a darker color than even your original hair? which is already darker than the highlights. ok thats confusing. of course the highlighted parts wont become lighter if you dye it darker. It'll still be lighter than the un-highlighted hair.

I was surprised. For a while I wanted to color my hair a darker, reddish shade of blonde so I kept trying the dye. So I would massage a lot of conditioner etc into my scalp before I dyed my hair. It helped but it can make the dye not "stick" to the hair near the scalp. <br>  <br>  I ended up just going back to bleaching my hair, as I realized it was way too grey to try to dye it, with this allergy.<br>  <br>  When I have dry flaky scalp, I use Selsan Blue with conditioner.|`|AA11073076	Dandruff shampoos and conditioners dry your scalp out because dandruff is really sometimes a scabby, oily condition.

If your scalp is itchy and you scratch it, the hair color will hurt really bad, so wait a few days!

Fastrack gets these sunglasses made in Italy and are imported here and then gets the brand name Fastrack. They are not durable. <br>  <br>  If you want to spend 1000 bucks or more, it's better to check out Police, Gucci, TagHuer, Ralph Lauren or other brands. I just gifted a smart Ralph Lauren glasses to my hubby and it costed only Rs. 2500.<br>  But I guess our eyes are invaluable and hence we should opt for better products only..<br>  <br>  The difference between a branded n non-branded glasses lies in the quality of Glass they use and what kind of treatment the glass has undergone.

I56uSWiYaa	Ok. If you have long hair you will need many boxs of a hair lightener ( stripper). I have waist length dark brown hair and use 5 boxs each time and you will probably need to do it twice. That is 10 boxs. It can be cheeper to go to the Pros. <br>  If you have short hair by all means do it your self. The stuff you are looking for will say Hair Lightener and that it can lighten up to maybe 7 shades with a single use. You will probably need to do it twice. I recomend doing this on the weekend like friday and then again on sunday. Your hair will go thru orange and red. Remain calm. Your blond may still have some red undertones. <br>  If you want a speciffic blond shade you must go to a salon.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|159e94526551af5e753c1377628944d4aa	To be extremely honest with you, unless you want your hair the color of orange Starbursts, you're gonna have to spend extra cash to visit the salon. I have had many experiences with all kinds of hair issues..and dyes that are not from the salon are very bad for your hair (the Nice N' Easy line uses pig fat, just to let you know). If it's a matter of money, you can just save up in a matter of months and go to a nice, clean salon..it doesn't have to be the most fancy, fresh and expensive place in the world. Supercuts is okay; and sometimes Gene Juarez has reasonable prices, but they are on the expensive side....<br>  but, no matter what, if you want blonde hair, you need to visit a salon.|`|1BruTzezaa	They bleach it. Go to a sally supply salon and ask more about that.|`|CuW5mveJaa	Wew...from Black to Blonde...quite a color change...that is pretty tricky without damaging your hair..<br>  There is really no safe way in doing this on your own from some walmart bought product...first of all you'll prob need to do it several times to get it blond, and then you will want to puta Toner in it as well,because you don't want to walk around with orange hair..or maby even green.. If it was something like..Hey I want to dye it brown or darkred.. I wouold of said Go for it..but Blonde...Whole nother ballgame..<br>  What I would suggest is go to a Local Cosmetology College or Beautyschool..they will not charge that much.. If you do it on your own and you mess it up,you'll have to go in and get it fixed anyway,and then you would have to pay much more..maby even loose some of your hair..|`|3l9IAwjQaa	Lightening it that much will damage your dark hair. But what you should do is have a friend help you and buy a product specifically used for bleaching and also, a color correcting toner because the bleach will give you orangey-brass results. By using the toner, you can offset the harsh warm tones and get a nice blonde instead of orange. Make sure to condition your hair very well afterward.|`|7iShV0naaa	you basically need a professional to help, ive tried bleaching my dyed black hair myself and nothing has worked its only given me scary halloween results|`|8b8e071dca38a1c244403c1c90281741aa	Go to a beauty school. It's the next best thing next to a salon because they are about to work in a salon, but i's like ten dollars. As for people with black hair and so on, when they do that themselves, they do a lot of damage to their hair. Definitely go to the beauty school and they will do you right.|`|AA11954428	Clorox.|`|KeY30ShNaa	I would use color stipper first, that way it doesnt only dye the roots, then if your doing this over the weekend, wash your hair for a day or two with a good refining shampoo, then dye your hair, but continue using the shampoo, it may be a little expensive, but it will be worth it so your hair isnt dead and breaking off. hope this helps|`|ZXoN4S9haa	you have to bleach your hair, then dye it blonde.|`|c2b02e9ecd23f132f51e1510e98b8b8faa	it is too risky to do it yourself|`|bf4458ccaeaf542c7c5810714bbdbd2aaa	if you can`t afford a salon, go to sally`s beauty store, buy bleach powder, and developer. read the instructions, once you`re done bleaching, add in your blonde color. it`ll really mess up your hair, i`m telling you it`s better off to just go to a pro, they know what they`re doing, and they have stuff to minimize the damage in your hair.

They also sell some of the E.l.f. makeup in Target stores (I find mine in the travel section).<br>  <br>  Go to the mall or to a department store like Macy's. You can have them do a makeover for you.<br>  <br>  Clothes: try a clothes swap with friends. Have your friends get together and make sure they all bring clothes that they don't want anymore. Then have a big swap, letting everyone go through all the other stuff. Whatever is left over at the end can be donated to a thrift store. If your crafty, you can add details to the clothes you already have, like new buttons on a jacket or something. Also thrift/vintage stores are good places to pick up unique items. They can be a little pricey sometimes though.|`|dc71f611979ec94e6cd095aef26a849daa	I'm not sure what you budget is but if you get a hair cut and your nails done the rest is pretty easy! your hair is one of the first things that people notice when they see you and if you do something fantastic with it people will notice and it will definitely make yo stand out. your hands is what you use to greet people if your nails are done or at least well taken care off people will notice your good hygiene. the outfit does not necessarily needs to be expensive you can make anything look good if you know how to wear it. GOOD LUCK!|`|f2ab298ee002a40adbb517fd222d7b9aaa	As far as make up go to a mall for a free make over.  They can tell you if you are cool toned or warm toned - colors in foundation, blush, eyeshadows, lipsticks, etc. (they will give this to you in writing if you ask, then you can go somewhere else like Walmart and buy less expensive brands but stick with the same color schemes) - and they can also tell you the great colors of clothes that correspond to "COOL" or "WARM" (whichever you truly are).  That gives you the info and basis on which way to go regarding clothes..... the colors that really enhance YOU.  Then you can build your look based on that.<br>  If you want to "up one" on your casual look, do just that.  Go to a Goodwill or Salvation Army or Thrift Store (with your colors in mind) and go one step dresser for that casual look.  As far as stepping up the dresser look, keep in mind the colors corresponding to you (were you COOL or WARM), costume jewelry is a great way - Claire's or somewhere not so expensive.<br>  I recently bought a cute pair of capris at Goodwill, got a cute top, got slip on (no back) little sandels with tiny heel - then to Claire's or Walmart and got big white beaded necklace ($5), white beaded bracelet ($5), and white hoop earrings ($5) - a tiny white bag from Goodwill $2.  Then I've worn the shoes, jewelry, and bag with lots of things (to go one step up on my casual look).<br>  NOTE: If you don't get the info regarding colors of clothes to buy, at the mall cosmetic counter - just find out whether you're COOL or WARM.  Then you can find out the colors... online go to www.ask.com and ask the question - or go to your local library.  Once you find out the COOL or WARM you're home free.  Another little "add-to" is the little long scarfs that hang around the back of your neck with both long tails brought forward (dangling straight down) - These really dress up a no collar T-Shirt - Those too are at Claire's (some have little beads or seqins sewn in) - just be careful and don't go overboard with that type look if it's daytime.  Hope some of this helps you.  I recently discovered Goodwill shopping...even Dr.'s wives do it.   Good luck.  And another thing is your hair...look in magazines, or ask a professional you trust, then opt for a Walmart salon or somewhere not so pricey.

It could be a guy who has lots of girlfriends and he is talking about his favorite, it could mean the best friend of a girl (gals call their female friends girlfriends, and it isn't a sexual thing AT ALL), it could mean a guy who has a lot of female friends and he is referring to his best friend who's a girl, or I suppose that in very rare instances it could refer to a lesbian with many girlfriends.  But I've never heard it said in that way before.

What are the circumstances of the question?  Is it a question about a female/male relationship OR a question about a female/female nonsexual relationship OR what exactly?  That's like asking "What is the last day"...last day to what? Shop before Christmas, the last day of the week?, last day I'll eat meat until next month or what?

I recommend laser treatments.  They treat the scars from underneath the skin rather than just taking the pigment out of the top layer of skin.  The scar is broken up from underneath, leaving no sign that it was ever there.  It is slightly painful and a little more expensive, but you do get what you pay for.|`|c2b02e9ecd23f132f51e1510e98b8b8faa	no not at all it can make them light temperarily|`|0ba6ef5e16614c50f1cf2d543649056baa	yep. it will lighten your scars but it will not remove them completely.|`|6e565a68c7956ae58cb085c439cf0c84aa	no|`|cbe18130bd791393cb5460d5d3e15b4eaa	It can be expensive, but you can get microdermabrasion done.

It overdrys your skin and the ingredients in toothpaste can irritate your skin and infect the blemish, making it worse.

Kind of like all the girls getting the tattoos on the side of their ribs!! It is hard to be original after a while because it is so common to get tattoos. Good Luck and remember to put a lot of thought into what you get...it is the gift that stands the test of time!!|`|da2280ec5adee9e8a42fd63e2653ae39aa	They have a min. price Generally $50. Though it may have gone up. It's been a couple of years.<br>  <br>  ***********<br>  <br>  Just so you know, lower baby tattoos are not trashy. And don't get tats if you are going to judge like that. The phrase tramp stamp had to have been the brain child of some guy who didn't get laid by some chick who had a tat there (maybe even me). I'm sure you know the old story. The drunk guy doesn't get the chick so she must be a s!ut.

yghcGbK5aa	It's absolutely possible, but the products you need you will not find in the shampoo section, you will find it in the cooking section.<br>  <br>  Here you go!  I have already gotten like a million best answers for this, and my friends call this hair crack.  So, don't pass this up!<br>  <br>  <br>  FOR THICK AND THIN HAIR<br>  <br>  1.  Warm up some olive oil in the microwave (not too hot, luke warm, and the purer the olive oil the better.)<br>  <br>  2.  Apply it all over your hair.  Apply it to dry hair. Especially pay attention to the ends. <br>  <br>  3.  Wrap your hair with plastic wrap.  (This is because it does get a little drippy sometimes).<br>  <br>  4.  Place a towel around your neck. (Same reason as above.)<br>  <br>  5. Leave in for an hour.<br>  <br>  6.  Shampoo and condition it out.  (Make sure not to slip in the shower, that stuff is slippery.<br>  <br>  THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIN HAIR<br>  <br>  Use coconut oil, and do the same as above. (It's not as drippy as olive oil though.)  Coconut oil isn't really great for people with thick hair. It tends to make thick hair a little tangled and  little greasy.  So people with thin hair only!<br>  <br>  Do this either once a week or every other week.  <br>  <br>  I have gotten so  many people hooked on this, it should be illegal.  <br>  <br>  Definetly do this and tell me how it works!|`|5f3101a567f940e1ceba4c117e4d1151aa	The women in the commercials are "hair models" and get paid very much money to spend every waking moment working on their hair.  Most of them have had thick, long, silky hair from the day they were born!  Many of us do not.  They constantly have every split end on their heads snipped off daily and mostly, ordinary girls like us do not.<br>  <br>  Then, when the commercial is being made, the women have their hair done by professional hair technicians and after conditioning and drying is done, the hair is straightened with a hot straightening iron by the hairdresser to give it that added sheen.<br>  <br>  BUT ... you can do all these things yourself!  Depending on whether your hair is dry, normal or oily ... wash it daily if it needs it and then condition.  I need to condition every day or my hair will stand on end with static ... but my sister only conditions every third day.  She has great, long thick hair but mine is thin and fine.<br>  <br>  Then use a straightening iron to flatten any split ends down to blend with the rest of your hair.  Finally, if you want more body, clip some extensions into your hair like I do to my fine hair for extra flip OR......<br>  <br>  pull your hair up and buy a bunch of fabulous, satiny wigs in different colours and be a different girl every day!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9Grns3dHaa	yesh u r right|`|9KTgRPobaa	What you see on tv are already edited, so don't believe it so much.

Para mantener y prologar el moldeado, nada como los sprays y lacas fijadoras con sus nuevas fórmulas no apelmazantes. <br>  UN TRUCO: secar el pelo boca abajo te dará más volumen a tu melena. <br>  Finalmente, puedes recurrir a las extensiones. Si están bien colocadas dan una apariencia muy natural y están de moda. <br>  <br>   Suerte!!!

Because perms are curly, they'll make your hair shorter so it depends what you want. Find a few short hair magazines and take a look through that.<br>  There's nothing wrong with getting a perm (unlike posters 1 and 2) - there are different types of perm you can have, it doesn't have to be unnatural tight curls. Just because everybody has dead straight hair it doesn't mean you have to! <br>  But if you want it curly, wear sponge rollers overnight - they do no damage and work just as well (they just don't last for more than a day...)<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Lorna|`|8d6ae5a42dddca82be705f10f6b74e58aa	I agree with the 1st post.|`|AA11872348	No, I don't think you should.

Bright colors are great, but sometimes jewel-toned shades are more sophisticated. Having said that, color can be great to add some flair to an otherwise neutral and drab wardrobe.<br>  <br>  Fit is important. In a classic look, it seems that nothing is ever too tight or baggy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for your hair, brush and comb it in the morning when you style it.

Shoes should always be polished, have heel tips replaced if they are starting to look run down. Spend a little more for some basic wardrobe pieces and use the lesser expensive pieces only for accent.   Buy pieces that are well constructed with better fabrics.

qQqC2cHIaa	If it's the store in Canada called Winners; I believe it's the Canadian equivalent to TJMax of the US.  Both my hubby and I love Winners.  They sell brand new up to the minute good department store type brands, like the kind found in The Bay, but much cheaper.  It's not a pretty store, it's kind of like a K-Mart, only with much better quality merchandise.  It's mostly casual and daytime wear, some party wear, and it's almost always clothing that's in fashion or fashion forward.  It's not like some outlets that try to pass of last year's rejects as this years fashion.  It's a store that you need to visit often because they always get new stuff and you never know what they're going to have.  I normally make and design (it's what I do for a living) all my own clothes, but Winners is one of the few stores I've bought clothing from.  And I love their shoes.|`|a717b8daf024453548f65d9a3c05b3b4aa	It might help if you type <br>  winners into your search bar!!!|`|0duJx9Mbaa	sorry, never heard of it.  they must not have any stores in southern new england. now how 'bout dem points?
pdM79ulLaa	Hola amiga, mmm tu pregunta es dificil, ya que la estatura del ser humano es el resultado de la suma de  diferentes factores como son la genetica(esto es la altura de tus papas abuelos tios etc.) la alimentacion, la zona geografica donde vive uno las actividades personales como el ejercicio etc.<br>  Ahora, para responder a tu pregunta te dire primero, NO TE PREOCUPES NI TE AGOBIES, estas aun en la edad donde precisamente estas creciendo mas, tu crecimiento se detendra hasta los 19 a?os, alimentate bien con cosas nutritivas, y si puedes y esto es extra y si es efectivo y mas a tu edad, trata de practicar algun deporte como el basquetbol, volibol o natacion, eso asegurara tu crecimiento y quiza lo haga mas rapido. Te doy un consejo? No te preocupes debes relajarte y recuerda que la gente vale mas por lo que trae adentro de si, no por la estatura y ademas hay "chaparritas" muy hermosas y mas sexys que algunas altotas y feas jeje. Y dicen por ahi, "los mejores  perfumes son los que vienen en envases peque?os" o "La estatura de la bondad se mide de la cabeza al cielo". Cuidate mucho.

El rayo láser es capaz de hacerlas desaparecer por completo cuando están en la fase rojiza o acaban de pasar a la nacarada. Las estrías , cuanto más antiguas son, más difíciles resultan de eliminar. <br>  Pero el láser consigue disimularlas haciendo un barrido por la zona afectada, de esta forma la estría adquiere un color parecido al del resto de la piel, camuflándose. Suele ser necesario un tratamiento de 12 sesiones para regenerar, nutrir y cicatrizar la piel da?ada . <br>  Primero se hace un pulido que limpie la piel de células muertas, se aplica después durante treinta segundos el rayo láser en cada estría y se da un masaje digital con un producto cicatrizante, para terminar aplicando una mascarilla regeneradora. Este tratamiento debe ser realizado por un medico especializado. No te olvides que, si tu piel está bien hidratada y nutrida, reaccionará mejor ante cualquier tratamiento. No hay que olvidar aplicar siempre una crema antiestrías en las zonas da?adas y una crema hidratante por todo el cuerpo. Toma una alimentación adecuada rica en vitaminas, las ideales para combatir las estrías son la E, la A y la C .|`|jg9rs7Suaa	En México hay una crema sólida que se llama Teatrical.

Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oval - Many choices<br>  As its name implies, the oval-shaped Face is longer than wide, with a jaw that is narrower than the cheekbones. Because the oval shaped face has no dominant areas and is so proportional, this face looks good with just about any hairstyle, length or texture,<br>   <br>  Round - Avoid width<br>  The round-shaped face has a wide hairline and fullness below the cheekbones. The client may be overweight and the neck may appear short. A geometric or linear style looks very good. Add height and long wispy sides to make the cheeks look narrow. Sides and nape comb close.<br>   <br>  Diamond - Reduce width at sides<br>  The diamond-shaped face has a narrow chin and forehead with wide cheekbones. Diamond shaped faces need narrow sides and fullness at the chin. Bobs work very well. Avoid height on top or volume on the sides. Use some fringe or bangs to cover narrow forehead.<br>  <br>  Heart - Add volume at chin<br>  The heart-shaped face is characterized by a wider forehead and a narrower chin. Bring some hair onto the forehead to disguise its width. Keep hair close to the head at the eyes but make it slightly full around the jaw, and below and in front of the earlobes.<br>   <br>  Pear - Add volume above jaw line<br>  The pear-shaped face is characterized by a small or narrow forehead and a rather large pouchy-appearing jaw line. Comb hair to add width from the eye level through the crown of the head. Set and comb hair close to the head on the sites and at the nape.<br>   <br>  Oblong - Add softness<br>  The oblong-shaped face has a long and narrow bone structure. An oblong facial shape often has a long, thin neck. Use a fringe or half-bang across the forehead by creating the soft waves or curls in the crown or nape areas. This helps to create the illusion of an oval.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairuwear.com/rw.aspx?pgID=958" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairuwear.com/rw.aspx?pgID=95...</a>

vkNMzetvaa	Yes benzoyl peroxide helps fight acne but not all skin care products contain benzoyl peroxide as an active ingredient, others have contain salicylic acid and that helps fight acne as well. However people have had allergic reactions to either one and both makes your skin itchy but thats what moisturizers are for. It also depends on your skin type and your hormones, if benzoyl peroxide is harsh on you you can try finding it in lesser concentrations or try products with salicylic acid. Research them.|`|J2HcR3rfaa	The Benzoyl peroxide helps clean out all the bacteria left in the pores. You'll have that stinging feeling right after cleaning your face with the peroxide. But it does make your face dry. Try looking into some Facial Moisturizers that will help keep the face moist after washing with the peroxide. Only use facial moisturizers because the reg moisturizers might end up clogging your pores and causing more acne.|`|vylfYG5Maa	yeh they do...though things containing Benzoyl peroxide tend to dry out your skin a bit so its good to moisturise after|`|VWoQO0gcaa	All acne products contain Benzoyl Peroxide. And yes it does. The Benzoyl peroxide goes does into your pores and removies and kills the dirt & bacteria that builds up in your pores.|`|4carwzZMaa	Yes, it kills the bacteria that cause the acne in severe cases.  It's an oxidizing agent, like hydrogen peroxide, but a little more stable and convenient to apply.  It was the only thing that worked for my brother and my sister (they had it bad).  For me, I just kept my face extra clean, wiping it occasionally with alcohol (another bacteria killer).  Don't "pop" pimples, because it aggravates it (healing takes longer, and you're likely to spread the bacteria. It is also more likely to result in scars/pock-marks).
jfPiJzJNaa	dont use an oil based product like vasline. before putting make up on use a moisturizer for sensitive skin, use it after washing your face or before you go to bed and use it when you put your make up on. try not to use too much though, this could cause your skin to look too oily. use only a quarter size, maybe even smaller as time goes by.<br>  <br>  (clean and clear daily moisturizer seems to work the best and wash your face with st ives apricot scrub, it gets rid of dead skin cells and leaves your face smooth and radiant.)|`|GAd2YDWWaa	try a moisturizing lotion that won't clog your pores.  also use a gentle exfloliator daily and to get the dead skin off|`|sIu5UhRCaa	You should probably look for an oil free moisturizer for your face.  This will give it hydration but not cause you to break out.  Don't use vaseline on your face.  It would probably cause your face to break out more.  I don't really like pressed powders  myself because the color always seems to be off with them.  I personally think that liquid foundation with loose powder on top works best on slightly oily skin tones.  In order to choose the right foundation color, you probably want to go to a department store counter and try them on.  It is the best way to find a color that will match your skin.|`|wNev92lsaa	Dont use powder when u have dry skin it looks horrible! Just use liquid cover-up.|`|0ds7uihRaa	Whoaaa ok, first off, get yourself into a good skincare routine. The acne is probably a huge inflammation of your dry skin and is making your oil glands work in oil drive. Your skin needs to get some of its natural moisture back so here are some tips:<br>  1) Cleanse your face with a gentle, creamy cleanser that soothese easily irritated dry skin. Try Grassroots All Well and Good Cleanser.<br>  2) Exfoliate with a scrub that has glycerin - it pulls moisture into the skin. Try Aveeno Skin Brightening Scrub<br>  3) Moistruize wiht a rich cream or blam that seals in water Such as Almay lotion. <br>  ****DO NOT put vaseline on because it will make you feel like a greaser and putting actual oil on your face will make it an oilslick. By following this routine, your face should be less inflamed. <br>  In the meantime, to cover up any existing blemishes, apply a sheer hydrating foundation that is oilfree and a cream concealer such as Revlon to the affected area. Finish off by setting the makeup in place by sweeping on a light dust of loose powder.|`|GH1nqOCkaa	Vassaline and petroleum will clog your pores and won't be good for your skin. Try using a face lotion twice a day, once in the morning before applying your makeup and again at night before you go to bed.

f31867564aa5d7924adcd9697d2e8acaaa	Some people are allergeic to petroleum based products. Although while the object is very likely to be tested by the FDA - I'd try natural products over petrol because of the fact that I personally feel safer with natural rather than artificial/chemical products. They are both chemicals but natural biotics as far as I am aware are safer and less toxic and do less enviornmental damage both in the production and afterlife of the product<br>  <br>  On the MDS safety sheet IT DOES SAY TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE IF SWALLOWED so if small quantities are injested overtime it may not be safe - also if it is absorbed into the blood stream it may also not be fully "safe"<br>  <br>  It is also a possible human carcinogen - (it can cause cancer) it can also become dangerous if it oxidizes...<br>  <br>  The product is rather not all to safe but it likely wont kill you right away - especially in small applications - I wouldn't recommend it for human usage though.<br>  <br>  You might try drinking more water as an alternative to dry lips -- also puttting oily substances on the lips might over oil them and cause other issues..<br>  <br>  but what works for you works for you I guess.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE JUST PERSONAL OPINION - I am not the FDA and I am not the petroleum industry - it is a largely uneducated opinion.<br>  <br>  p.s. bottled watter can be safer than some tap water - so too can rainwater be safer than some tap water -- depending where you are.<br>  <br>  pps in addition to drinking water you may like to eat banana's they are yummy.|`|0fe67dfb8b28ab7e7d037e7a7c7954cdaa	uh.. when i use to do that it made it worst.. haha i rather chapstick..

It sounds like you recently started your process... just remember to twist your hair weekly (only when wet/damp never when dry - it can cause breakage over time).  Also, keep your hair conditioned well.  Use products that are herbal based. Try not to use products that are sold over the counter while your locking your hair.  Locking is a "natural " process. You want your hair to become accostumed to the process without dealing with the synthetic stuff they put in over the counter products.  Lastly, try not mess with your hair during the process of locking.   Your hair will lock on its own.  Most importantly, do not USE Bees Wax.  It attracts dirt easily and it's  difficult to get out of your hair.  Use either hair gel or a "locking butter".   You'll love the process of your hair transforming. Good luck!

My class briefly talked about this happening, in Chemistry the other day.<br>  <br>  Basically, the peroxide would have seriously damaged your hair (as you would have already known).<br>  But there are ways to try and strengthen your hair again, except time is definitely a factor. It's not going to happen over night, so you'll have to put effort into keeping a healthy hair regime, and stay away from dyes for a long time.<br>  <br>  That being said; oil treatments and damage control is the way to go!<br>  <br>  VO5 Hot Oil Treatments are one of the best, in my opinion. There are many different types, including some new shampoo and conditioner strands in the deep damage control sector of the brand.<br>  So just take a trip to the supermarket and invest in a decent amount of hot oil treatments, and some other heavy duty hair damage control products. :]|`|yghcGbK5aa	I once went in to a salon to die my hair a darker brown, it turned black...it took them 4 times to color my hair to the color I wanted..<br>  it was terrible, my hair was messed up for months and months.<br>  <br>  as soon as this happened, a mircale was given to me by my friend, I have passed on this info, as it shouldn't be kept a secret.<br>  <br>  this will help rebuild your hair, and get it back to healthy...<br>  <br>  everytime I do it, it feels like baby's hair,  my friends and I starting call this hair crack cause it's the best.<br>  <br>  do this absolutely!<br>  <br>  Here you go! I have already gotten like a million best answers for this, and my friends call this hair crack. So, don't pass this up!<br>  <br>  <br>  FOR THICK AND THIN HAIR<br>  <br>  1. Warm up some olive oil in the microwave (not too hot, luke warm, and the purer the olive oil the better.)<br>  <br>  2. Apply it all over your hair. Apply it to dry hair. Especially pay attention to the ends. <br>  <br>  3. Wrap your hair with plastic wrap. (This is because it does get a little drippy sometimes).<br>  <br>  4. Place a towel around your neck. (Same reason as above.)<br>  <br>  5. Leave in for an hour.<br>  <br>  6. Shampoo and condition it out. (Make sure not to slip in the shower, that stuff is slippery.<br>  <br>  THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIN HAIR<br>  <br>  Use coconut oil, and do the same as above. (It's not as drippy as olive oil though.) Coconut oil isn't really great for people with thick hair. It tends to make thick hair a little tangled and little greasy. So people with thin hair only!<br>  <br>  Do this either once a week or every other week. <br>  <br>  I have gotten so many people hooked on this, it should be illegal. <br>  <br>  Definetly do this and tell me how it works!|`|c9f4f25ac9d74e5f1e69bd57259aa983aa	conditioner it real well and stop coloring it have some of the dead ends cut off.|`|AA12100043	you can try having a Kerastase’s Vitaciment Treatment. i've read this on an article on the net. i've included a site for you in my source.|`|EPk5J1bFaa	whoa. that's bad. i'd say lay off the coloring for a while. let your hair rest and recuperate. umm..... take vitamins? lol. idk.|`|GOs5SVKCaa	your hair is lacking protein now, as our hair is made up of protein initially, you will have to go buy a protein treament, i will suggest for you a great treatment its by loreal, its in a green tub, its a lil pricey but it works superb and will stop u from all the worrying after a couple of gos. this will strenthen your hair. so for the first week i would do nothing but protein treatment, then at night before u go to bed, id buy some jo joba oil to condition also as too much protein can make ur hair to strong, apply it all over the hair this will condition it it is also the closest thing to the oil our scalp produces to keep our hair soft and strong. do the protein treatments for a week it will get rid of the jelly feel of ur hair,: wash ur hair with a nice conditioning shampoo, towel dry it then apply the loreal AGE RECHARGE protein treatment. it works very well it will put structure back into the hair shaft. there are also leave in protein treaments u can put in before ublow dry it off just for peace of mind also, id do both. id also keep your hair dark for atleast 6 months, DO NOT chop it off!!!! jus see how it all goes with the treatments first in 6 months time, after that u can start with some highlights again if u prefer lighter hair.xoxox|`|mT3IsZBSaa	I've had the same problem before...unfortunately that amount of damage is not really reverseable.  All you can do now is be extra gentle, use lots of leave-in conditioner, and don't brush it while it's wet.  I ended up with half a mohawk because of all the hair that broke off - hopefully yours won't be as bad, but don't worry even if it is.  I actually found some new ways to do my hair as I was trying to cover it up, and it grew out pretty quickly.

L8vTzMDlaa	i use MAC studio fix foundation (which is foundation and poweder in one). Then I apply Benefit's "hollywood glow" to my cheeks. Its a liquid that you dab to the apples of your cheeks that gives that 'dewy and illuminating' look.|`|1d720f31c5211465e64c20e7647d4c37aa	a dewy look is more wet looking, and you can achieve that by wearing moisturizer and foundation, then highlighting areas like above your cheekbones, temples, bridge of nose with a eyeshadow that is lighter than your skin tone slightly. <br>  Natural, go for tinted moisturizer and that's it. It's natural, remember.<br>  Matte is slightly harder. I have the same skin as you, so, what you'd want to do is get a good face powder...try physicians formula. Put foundation on (don't forget moisturizer!! get one with sunscreen in it, btw.) then the powder all over your face. Put a little bit extra on the t-zone. (nose and forehead) Buy oil-blotting sheets, and about noon-ish, blot the oil away and re-apply powder. You can buy oil-controlling stuff that you put on your face from Pro-activ. Try looking at their website. If not there, try going to a clinique counter, they may have something. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f68f2190a19408cdd63208bbda9f1467aa	<a href="http://www.iballer.com/wallpaper/divas/divas_d_k/knightley" rel="nofollow">http://www.iballer.com/wallpaper/divas/d...</a><br>  <br>  I would say that Keira Knightley often has the "natural" make-up look.  Natural doesn't mean less make up, it is actually makeup that compliments your skin tone and is close to your natural color of skin, eyes, and hair.
0ds7uihRaa	To bring out the warmth and golden under hues of your skin, you can never go wrong with beautiful, rich jewel tone colors. Good ones to try are:<br>  *Sapphire Blues (Revlon ColorStay 12 Hour Eyeshadow in Sultry Smoke $12)<br>  *Turquoise (Mac Single Eyeshadow Pots in Jewel Blue, Aquadisiac, and Big T - $16.50 each)  <br>  *Emeralds and forest greens (Revlon Colorstay 12 Hour Shadow in Spring MOss $12)  <br>  * Deep Eggplant and purples (Revlon Colorstay 12 Hour Eyeshadow in Berry Bloom $12).<br>  <br>   Each of these colors do well to create an exotic and stunning smokey eye look.  As well, they are great for complementing golden skin, without overwhelming the complexion with dark colors. <br>  So with that said, please avoid the black and grey smokey eye look. This is great for people with fair, porcelain complexions, but for olive skintones, can look quite heavy. <br>  <br>  P.S. For a more natural smokey eye look, you can never go wrong with deep bronzes, coppers, and honey champagne colors. These work well with every skintone and create subtle, yet sexy makeup. Try Revlon ColorStay Eyeshadow Quad in Copper Spice.|`|IHWngaDxaa	go on youtube and there are good videos that show u step-by-step how to do it!!

To me, this indicates that you will  likely not wear them again.  Perhaps, you've grown into a new more sophisticated style?

5a4n0WAgaa	You will need to make an appointment with a professional hair stylist, and it is best to choose a specialist in hair color.  They will use a professional hair color remover.  Now nothing is going to remove the black completely, even if it is only semi permanent.  You see even though it is only semi permanent, where your hair is porus, it is going to penetrate and deposit a bit.  The point is to remove as much as possible before going on to "color correction".<br>  <br>  Color Correction is an art and when done properly, your hair will look almost identical to its previous state to the hair dye.  Now if you'd like to do something a bit different or drastically different to your hair, that's fine, and can  be done at the color correction stage.  <br>  <br>  If you have a major metropolition city near you (50 miles I would gladly travel for color correction), I'd look there.  You can go to your local library and look up the area code for that city and look at their yellow page directory. You can also do this online.  Look under beauty or hair salons and then see if there is a color correction catagory.  <br>  <br>  You will be amazed at what a professional color correction artist can do!  Please choose a professional that has gone on to a school after cosmotology school, just for color.  Many people will practice color correction, based soley on experience.  I am not knocking these people, but you want to be absolutely sure that this person has the education and expertese to fix your issue.  <br>  <br>  I think you are going to be happier then when you even began!|`|71hDPfhNaa	if you wash it with hot water and it doesm't come out, try dying it over :)|`|9hMesFMjaa	Try washing your hair with really hot water (as hot as you can handle). This will open your pores and allow the color to come out. You could also try using a chelating shampoo which will help strip the color, but don't use it too often. I wouldn't recommend dying over it because you will have to dye it darker, or use bleach to go lighter... and with either one you will have to continue to retouch it. I would use the tips I recommended, and if it's not fading in a couple more weeks, go see a professional.|`|mtwV3pouaa	you could strip your hair, if there is anywhere in your area that can do that. its somewhat hard on your hair, but it takes the dye out of your hair, and some extra oil too, if you have oily hair.|`|AA11872348	Wash your hair with dish soap,it should make it fade.Use conditoner after. The more you use the dish soap the more it should fade.

It could be just me.|`|5a4n0WAgaa	For hair that has been colored, or straightened, or had other chemical treatments, I recommend the "NanoWorks Restorative Hair Treatment" by Pureology.  It is an award winning hair miracle!  It will restore, rejuvenate, dramatically improve hair condition and color vibrancy.  This is the highest quality product with all of the newest technology.  The ingredients have been broken down in to nano spheres so they can penetrate the hair cuticle and get in the cortex of the hair to correct the damage.  This is what technology has finally given us. <br>  <br>  Regarding the Garnier Fructis leave in conditioner, I read the ingredients and they are very inexpensive ingredients and really not any good.  The oils used are not broken down small enough to penetrate the hair cuticle, so all they are going to do is coat the hair.  Will make your hair greasy feeling and heavy.  Does nothing to correct the damage and will only make it feel a bit smoother with the oil and wax coating until you wash your hair the next time.  Doesn't fix anything. <br>  <br>  If you do not want to purchase a pricey product like Pureology (Pureology is concentrated)and lasts longer because you use less), and want to purchase something available in a grocery store or a drug store (can be found in major brand stores such as Safeway, Albertsons and Longs or Walgreens) you could use K-Pak Hair Repair System by Joico.  This is a deep conditioning pack that will bring back moisture and protein and use good ingredients and is a professional product.  <br>  <br>  To deep condition your hair you will need the following items:<br>  <br>  1.  Chelating Shampoo (purifying shampoo to remove any hair product and mineral build up- even removes prescription medicine build up) Pureology makes a great one but you can buy "Aloe Rid" by Nexxus in major brand grocery and drug stores.<br>  <br>  2.  Shower Cap (buy the one with the thinnest material, usually the disposible style you find in hotels).  You need the heat to penetrate the cap in to your hair.<br>  <br>  3.  Large tooth comb. (doesn't need to be expensive, one by Goody will be fine.  If you've bought Pureology, they include a coomb in the box.)<br>  <br>  4.  Blow dryer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Then follow these steps:<br>  <br>   First, put 4 to 5 large bath towels in dryer with heat setting turned all the way up and timer set on the longest setting.<br>  <br>  Wash your hair with a chelating shampoo. (Follow directions on label and may need to wash twice if you haven't used a chelating shampoo in a few months.<br>  <br>  Blot hair with towel to remove excess water.<br>  <br>  Apply conditoning pak to hair, starting at the ends, working your way up to the scalp.  Make sure you completely coat the ends.  <br>  <br>  Coomb through hair with large tooth coomb, to evenly saturate hair with conditioner.  Start combing at the ends, working your way further up the hair shafts, inch by inch, to be gently with your wet hair.<br>  <br>  Push your hair up on to the top of your head.  If you need to, use bobby pins to keep your hair up in top of your head.  Do not twist your hair or wrap it tightly as you want the heat to be able to penetrate evenly and to all of the hair.<br>  <br>  Put on shower cap.<br>  <br>  Turn on blow dryer and point nozzel toward head, as if you were drying your hair.  Blow all of head evenly but longer if you have more hair piled up then the rest of your head.  The point is to heat up all of your hair under neath the shower cap.  When hair and conditioner feels hot (don't get it so hot that it will burn and be careful of your ears) put your shower cap on.<br>  <br>  Take out a large hot towel that has been been heated on dryer setting for 20 minutes to get it nice and hot.  Wrap around your head (with the shower cap still on), turban style.  <br>  <br>  Wear towel until it starts to cool, then go and get a new hot towel out of the dryer.  Repeat again and again until your've had your hair under the shower cap with the towel on for one hour.<br>  <br>  After the one hour of treatment, go and rinse your hair thoroughly.<br>  <br>  Repeat every 2 weeks for treatment and then after hair is healthy, use once a month.|`|knQYrljnaa	i dont know i wont recomend using the garnier fructis leave in conditioner it makes your hair oily and use the put in rinse out kind in the shower

Lo que hay que tener claro es que el peinado que escojas ha de ser acorde con tu estilo de siempre y que no te debes encontrar incómoda con él. Además es muy importante el tipo de ropa que lleves porque de lo que se trata es de dar una imagen conjuntada. Sin duda alguna, los escotes delanteros se ven favorecidos con los recogidos, igual que las espaldas al aire que se hacen así aún más sugerentes. Si tienes el pelo largo, una melena impecable siempre es un acierto.

Con este producto se difuminan peque?as imperfecciones y se iguala el tono de la piel. Extiéndelo por el rostro y el cuello. Elígelo con una textura fluida y que el color sea el más parecido al de tu piel. Tienes varias marcas en el mercado. Yo te recomiendo el de: Clarins, Chanel, Estée Lauder... elige tú. <br>  3o-Polvos. Su misión principal consiste en fijar el maquillaje sobre la piel y aumentar su duración. Cinco toques de polvos son suficientes para conseguir un cutis de terciopelo. El primero debe darse en la frente, el segundo en la nariz y la barbilla y el último en cada mejilla. Después sólo hay que difuminar hacía los lados con una brocha hasta eliminar el exceso de polvo. Me encantan los de Guerlain (Les Météorites Poudre pour le Visage Pluie de Nacres) son un poco caros, 6.250 pts. Pero duran mucho y merece la pena. <br>  4o-Sombras de ojos. Utiliza una en tono beige clarito, en polvo. En el huesecillo debajo de la ceja, puedes aplicare un toque del mismo colorete que vas a utilizar, difumínalo bien. <br>  5o-Colorete. El rubor de tono beige ligeramente encendido se aplica desde el centro de la mejilla hasta la sien y en dirección a las orejas. El secreto está en difuminarlo bien y que se confunda con la piel. Lanc?me, Margaret Astor, Chanel…etc. Elige entre las distintas marcas. <br>  6o-Pesta?as. Dos capas de rímel negro son suficientes para dar máxima intensidad a la mirada. Es importante que elijas uno bueno para que no te estropee demasiado las pesta?as. <br>  7o-Labios. me gusta más una boca natural. El efecto voluminoso se pone a punto con un poco de "gloss" brillante, Levres Scintillantes, de Chanel, tono Galaxie.|`|nLQb5IwTaa	te recomiendo que uses los productos de clinique yo los uso y me han ayudado mucho a mejorar mi cutis|`|QhHrNPJuaa	100% natural ninguno pero los mejores son los de clinique y neutrogena ya que son marcas reconocidas por el quidado de la piel , los maquillajes son sin aceites que eso te friega tu cara horrible y son dermatologicamente aprovados.|`|U3BNPtwHaa	De donde escuchaste que no son buenas para la salud???? Quizá pueda ser buena o mala para la piel pero no para la salud. Todos los maquillajes cumplen ciertos aspectos que necesita nuestra piel. Antes que nada necesitas saber que tipo de piel tienes y después tienes que saber cuanta cubertura requieres. Tienes manchas? O rojizo? O a lo mejor tienes la piel grasa? Necesitas un maquillaje humectante en crema si tienes la piel seca pero si tienes la piel grasa necesitas un maquillaje especializado para esto ya sea en polvo o en liquido.  Todas las marcas tienen lo suyo.. yo tampoco he encontrado marca favorita y sigo buscando!

HOEVYrNAaa	It can get pretty pricey. It depends on the brand of contacts that you're wanting, the doctor you go to, and your specific prescription. Firstly, you will have to go to a doctor to make sure that you can wear contacts and he/she will let you try on different colors (it's pretty fun, I did it one time). Then you have a doctor's fee (usually $75-$90).... that's not even including the contacts!

QW1OBeWRaa	if i were u i would go to the salon|`|BgBHhW4laa	Shakira had really good straight hair in the beginning of her career, but she bleached it, and dyed it so much it got like that. So i'm not sure how to get it exactly like that. I know that she had good hair before because in the beginning of her career she only sang in spanish and I'm spainsh. I listened to her music alot and she had really good hair back then. She's been through alot of colors since then. So her hair isn't naturally like that, she damaged it|`|ayG7yFlhaa	you would have to bleach your hair for her color, perm it for the curls (without curling it everyday), then volumize it with a volumizing mousse and blowdrying it upwards.|`|iOltphTwaa	I would start by getting a product by Matrix called "Sleek Looks" They have a shampoo and conditioner then a product that is called extreme that you would put in after and  smooth it out a bit.  You will have to play with a bit.  You may have to get a bit barrel curling iron to loosen the curls a bit.  This is a anti-humidity product so if you use the products right is should stay.
rRm1jwUwaa	Pls don't even try that. If its meant for body don't risk it by putting on your face. As I've mentioned over and over again, anything for face could be used on body if you like but anything specifically for body do not apply onto your face. The chemical could be too strong for your face especially for eyes cos the skin around the eyes are so thin and sensitive. There is plenty of products to reduce swelling and puffiness on eyes alright. Hope this helps.|`|SjWt1cdgaa	you should, just try i mean obviously your eye area is still your face sooooooo.....<br>  and where can i get that?

pn3fB9Vlaa	This is a simple, and great to know, blow drying technique for bringing out the natural curl in both long and short hair. Anyone, with the possible exception of those with fine, very straight hair, can get an amazing amount of volume and curl if you will try this. You do not have to wash your hair, just make sure it is wet, and add a little gel or mousse to it if you would like. In fact, unless your hair is very fine and prone to being weighed down by hair products, leaving it just a little dirty will actually add volume to your curls! You also might want a place to sit while you do this.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Holding your hair dryer in one hand, bend at the waist, and flip your hair upside down, so the ends are all hanging towards the ground. With your free hand, grab a handful of the ends of your hair and bring your hand up towards your head, gathering up hair as you go. You should have a big handful of hair. Hold it loosely in your hand, and aim the warm air all around your hand for 15 seconds or so. Release that hair, and repeat with another section of hair. Move all around your head! You should be able to get all of the way around your head with about 5 handfuls.<br>  <br>  Step 2: When you have had a go at all of your hair, take a few seconds and aim the dryer at your scalp. Rub your free hand in small circles all over your head while aiming the dryer at your scalp. This will create volume in your hairstyle, and even when you wear it straight it is a good technique to use. No one looks good with hair flat to their scalp.<br>  <br>  Keep repeating these steps until your hair is mostly dry. The tighter you squeeze your hair as you dry it, the more curl you will get, and the longer it will take to dry. This can take from 5-20 minutes, depending on how long and thick your hair is. When your hair is nearly dry, add a little hairspray at your scalp, and through the rest of your hair, and do one more quick round with the hairdryer. I would love to see what you all can do with this–please send your before and after pictures to me!<br>  <br>  Tips: Try having some layers cut into your hair if you don’t have them, to maximize your “curl power!” Also, the more frequently you scrunch your hair, the easier it is. Embrace your curls!|`|3jzkR0cYaa	yeah mousse works REALLY good thats what i use and it works every time. use a controlling mousse|`|73mroS8Uaa	Herbal essense is a good cheap mousse....  and add some hair gel after the mousse to tame the frizz... i use aussie and the combination works really well|`|BWHD3Dnoaa	use Matrix Curl Life shampoo and conditioner (green bottles) then you can use a mouse if you want flip head upside down and blow dry scrunching with hands untill almost dry and spray with voulumizing hairspray, blowdry somemore. done.|`|VIX2xDKdaa	Wavy Style<br>  1. Wash your hair with a curl shampoo (Herbal Essences, Sunsilk, etc.) or a volume shampoo if you have thin hair (Herbal Essences has a great one). Then condition. <br>  2. If you have frizz-prone hair, put in a frizz serum (John Frieda has a great one). <br>  3. Then put in some leave in conditioner and dry your hair or let it air dry. <br>  4. Once hair is ALMOST dry, apply mousse or a gel to use for scrunching. Then separate your hair into 5 sections, letting one down and pinning up the other 4 with clips. Then use the mousse/gel to scrunch hair, being sure to dispurse the products well. Then scrunch up your hair again and pin in up. Repeat with the other 4 sections. <br>  5. Then blow dry on cool until hair is totally dry. <br>  6. Take out clips and enjoy your new style!|`|np9ubYfdaa	i agree with sillyme. use aussie.|`|lJSHAkoraa	use that aussie stuff with the kangaroo on the front.
pzdUzTroaa	What's your objection to heels...just don't like them?<br>  <br>  Wear black or dark straight-leg pants that almost touch the ground in back when you are wearing shoes. If they bunch up too much on your foot, it'll call attention to your short legs. A crease in front of the pant legs will help. Never wear cropped or cuffed pants.<br>  <br>  Wear shirts that end just at or below your waistline, and that are similar in shade/color to the pants. If you wear dark pants and a light-colored shirt, that cuts you in half and emphasizes short legs.<br>  <br>  If you wear a shorter skirt, wear dark or matching tights--not nude or contrasting. And, match your shoes to the tights, too.<br>  <br>  Monochromatic (all one color) dressing has an elongating effect.|`|tUnvjc8Baa	1- For Looking Taller: Tighter is Often Better<br>  <br>  You may not be completely thrilled with the idea of wearing tight clothing, as it can be pretty uncomfortable. However, tighter is typically better. The reason may be because it helps emphasize your lines, ultimately helping you look taller. When you wear baggier clothing, you will probably find that your lines will not be so visible, which will ultimately cause you to look shorter. The only instance in which bagginess is an exception when it comes to dressing as a short person is when it comes to shirts and jeans. When you tuck a baggy shirt into tighter jeans, you will notice that your legs will look just as long (or tall) as they would if you were to wear a tighter shirt. <br>  <br>   2 - For Looking Taller: Avoid Wearing Capris or Crop Shorts<br>  <br>  Chances are that you have always loved the appearance of Capris or Crop shorts. If you are aiming to look taller, however, wearing both of these types of shorts is not going to help. For some reason, they tend to make short people's legs look even shorter and stubby. You may be wondering what you should wear if you are not comfortable wearing short shorts. Well, your best option is to probably try out Bermuda shorts. Since these shorts will typically cutoff right before the knee begins, or in some cases right below the knee, your legs will get an overall longer appearance. Keep in mind that the same rule applies to skirts; those that end close to the ankles will make you look shorter, whereas those that end closer to the knee will help elongate your legs. <br>  <br>  <br>  3- For Looking Taller: Don't Wear Flat Shoes|`|k79j5scJaa	Pay attention to horizontal lines. They will make you look taller. Try wearing skinny jeans with pointy toed shoes making it appear as one straight line. You can also wear skirts above your knee with matching tights (again one straight line). Good luck - I'm sure you look great!!|`|55c76l3Eaa	Stand up straight.  Have good posture.<br>  Wear skinny jeans that cut off at the ankle.  It makes your legs look longer. |`|Pa2DF9tpaa	Where shorts so they make your legs look longer. |`|e5jW9V2Naa	eat veggies <br>  i do tht and im tall|`|eTPeGfiZaa	high heels|`|m0LkRBiEaa	wear skinny jeans |`|mNgdUg7Yaa	Skinny jeans all the way !  Flats are a no,no!!|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Always wears heels, 4 inches about whether you're wearing sandals or boots.  And short legged people aren't supposed to wear low waisted pants.  That would be easy if high waisted pants weren't so dammn ugly.<br>  <br>  Oh, and response to ohmygosh...pants that cut off at the ankle shortens the leg.  Wear pants that cover the tops of your shoes, that will add length to your legs as well.|`|tbdyeIagaa	don't wear skinny jeans. wear dark washes with a slight flair and ballet flats. don't wear overly long tips because that'll make them look shorter. wear high waisted jeans and a short top that'll make them look REALLY long. just make sure u can pull it off :)|`|g2GogSALaa	Wear skinny jeans or really wide-legged "sailor" pants.<br>  They'll help to make your legs longer.<br>  Miniskirts help too, but wear them with flats.<br>  Wear long-torsoed shirts!<br>  Those will all help.|`|2EdVsgciaa	Besides heels, jeans that are longer but not super flary give an illusion of length to your legs|`|dYl45g5Raa	wear high heals and skinny jeans.<br>  |`|tkYrGtQFaa	walk on your toes

HMsGZmQuaa	As I understand it from an anthropological perspective, it began originally in urban areas as a symbol that someone had been to prison (because in prison, they take your belt away).  It showed that a person was tough and hard.  Unfortunately, it caught on and became exaggerated (as most symbols and fashions of this nature do).  I couldn't tell you what it "means" now, and I doubt many people who wear their pants in this style could either.  It has become a fashion, just like bell-bottom pants or those awful shirts that make thin girls look pregnant. =)<br>  <br>  p.s.

And for that matter Latino, Asian and all other nationalities. You need a reality check. Everyone does it.<br>  |`|qPaREyr2aa	It's just another style of a different type of person. I mean, can you say "why do nerd where there pants high?"<br>  <br>  |`|WoU3ueweaa	Not all black guys wear their pants low and I've seen other races do that too. I think it's a matter or choice, personality, and culture (like music).

Pero no quieras hacerlo a las malas porque te vas a quemar el pelo.

If you have a Sephora near you, I know a month or two ago they were discontinuing the entire line at their store, and everything was half off, so that'd be a good way to check it out (and test it as well), if you can visit a store. Also, try the reviews on MUA (Make-Up Alley), they're usually pretty good and thorough.|`|o1QViLtBaa	I haven't really used that because I'm not at all particular about mascara since I have thick and lengthy lashes anyway BUT I have used other products of theirs and loved them.

Though, you can always go into a cosmetic shop and try it yourself before you purchase it.|`|moSZpN8Taa	OMG this is the best mascara to me that i have used in the past but now my favorite mascara is DEFINE -A-LASH volume Mascara by Maybelline new york.<br>  <br>  P.S.

Y8kjVeLyaa	That is razor cut....you need VERY sharp scissors...and the knowledge of how to razor cut....I wouldn't risk it myself...but google "how to razor cut" and go from there...remember the golden rule of cutting fringes...cut half an inch LONGER than you want it to end up...it ALWAYS works out better that way..you can cut more off if it is too long but you can't put it back on. I advise you to cut it dry. And tie the rest of your hair up.|`|DXLfbKUBaa	Dont use  the scissors in the normal way to cut in a fringe, instead snip into your fringe with the points of the scissors practise first on a tassel|`|whvaaBFwaa	Don't bother<br>  Everyone I know who's cut their own hair in the past has made it look like crap. Seriously, save up and go to the hairdressers. That's what they're there for and at least they're trained.<br>  Unless you want to end up with a sabotaged fringe, I would keep scissors at least 10ft away from your fringe.|`|9CvKzFSOaa	You cant.... Why dont you get a part time job and then go to the hairdressers and pay to get it cut? :0
yrshMgvTaa	is it permanent or semi? it will fade gradually as u wash it..but ive found using anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner makes the fading process alot quicker(and quite annoying if you like your colour!) or alternatively u could go to a hair dressers and it highlighted or a bleach wash but that ruins your hair..:)|`|4ceE9TFcaa	calm down, honey.<br>  <br>  the colour will get lighter on its own, each time you wash your hair.<br>  give yourself some time to get used to the colour :-) |`|c369c7306456f90492efcd3202572c4caa	If its a semi perm colour buy something like a medicated shampoo 'vosene' (spelling sorry)  it will help to lighten it quicker.    Also wash it more often.<br>  <br>  If its a perm colour then im afraid you can do nothing more than over dye it.  But I would suggest buying some clip in hair extension in another shade.  (this is what i did because the same thing happend to me)  I bought some blonde real hair clip in extensions and put some around the front/sides of my hair line.

Lol.|`|3y2G8wgjaa	Strange Q...but here comes my answer!<br>  <br>  Well, as most people know, the SIZE of a certain thing can be adjusted visually by placing certian things within its range of view.  Such as a house can look larger with small or no trees around it, yet the same size house can look smaller with LARGE trees around it.<br>  <br>  Your Q says 'LOOK smaller"...so I would suggest wearing Larger glasses/sun-glasses or hat or something that will help make it LOOK smaller.  Unfortunately, you are stuck with it and would require surgery to actually MAKE it smaller.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|txlxfEwpaa	if ur a girl the onli thing i can recomend is to create different shadows on ur nose , highlight the middle of your nose with a ligher shade of foundation ( very slightly) , this will make the middle of ur nose stand out more thn the rest of ur nose and make it seem less large. hope ive helped, look up makeup contouring :)|`|K8mkezAPaa	Go to benefit, they have an online site, and they have a beauty product... ahhh, i forgot what it's called.

OoJHvZMdaa	wearing the eyeliner and mascara is fine, but mascara eventually makes ur eyelashes brittle. what i do is wear eyeliner and a little gold eyeshadow, but not too much just enough to accent my eyes then i take water  and curl my lashes, people always complement me on my eye makeup when im barely wearing any. also you should do something to ur nails, it looks like you bite them try to kick that habit and paint them so your hands wont looks so plain.|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	I think it is completely ok to wear eyeliner and mascara everyday<br>  <br>  but I know that it is not very good on the long term for your eyes and eye lashes<br>  <br>  So my advice is sometimes you can go with mascara only <br>  <br>  Sometimes eyeliner only<br>  <br>  And sometimes maybe just a gloss<br>  <br>  BTW, you are cute|`|O3OBrXk2aa	no its fine to wear them every day just remove it before you go to bed with an eye makeup remover. (try clinique's, theirs is great)|`|hS1xOxksaa	i think that is okay.<br>  i also think you are very pretty.<br>  and maybe wear some like gold eye shadow.<br>  shimmery stuff.<br>  <3|`|iy4WYvQJaa	i think you are very pretty!|`|DxI9xBrwaa	Tips: <br>  Eyeliners- dont use jet black, it makes most girls look like a raccoon. maybe brown or dark brown.<br>  <br>  Mascra- dont use waterproof it can make you eyelashes fall off. Also use clear mascra.<br>  <br>  Eye shadow- do a gold shimmer, not glitter. glitter is different from shimmer because glitter gives a tackie look. <br>  <br>  Foundation- do powder like bare mineral, its not cakey at all. it give it a nature look and no shiny face.

WjmKGB3faa	I have bad skin, so I take good care of it. <br>  <br>  I use all-natural products (lush)<br>  <br>  I use a clay cleanser (aquamarina)<br>  I follow with tea tree oil for a toner<br>  I moisturize. I use the thick stuff for the day and the acne-fighting moisturizer at night.<br>  <br>  toner is there to make your skin look like it is glowing and evening out the skintone.<br>  <br>  I used to start my face with warm water and wash off with cold. <br>  Now I start with warm water and wash off with it, and use my moisturizer that I keep in the fridge to end it. <br>  <br>  warming up the water opens pores, and cold water closes them. So if you close them with a cool moisturizer you do wonders for your skin.|`|TPDb5awiaa	I'm 16 and used to have horrible skin at around your age! Pimple, blackheads and pimple scars - you name it, I have it. <br>  <br>  A toner is used to tighten your pores and clean away excess dirt which is not removed by you facial cleanser. I wash my face with warm water but I heard that washing it with cold water helps to tighten pores (I don't know whether its true though).<br>  <br>  I envied people with clear skin. I started using THE BODY SHOP products since the beginning of this year (its quite costly but its worth it!) and my skin changed for the better. I can hardly see blackheads on my skin now. And if you have frequent outbreaks, don't ever pop or pick your pimples! You will have unsightly scars on your face which will stay for a short period of time. My breakouts were also minised.<br>  <br>  I suggest you wash your skin twice a day, tone, and apply pimple cream/moisturiser. We are both "lazy" people, and I think that this routine is easy to follow. <br>  <br>  All the best!|`|Kpv4vnJPaa	I use proactive solution.<br>  <br>  basically in the morning i use the cleanser and wash off with warm water and then use the toner and follow with the repairing lotion. <br>  <br>  and then at night i do the same, although usually twice a week i use the face mask to help absorb oil. (:<br>  <br>  It's helping to clear my pimples, and sort of working to stop break outs.<br>  <br>  if you have acne, i'd recommend this. <br>  <br>  Also, a toner is used to remove the dirt that the cleanser left. and I think warm water is better, i don't know why. That's just what it says on most skincare products.<br>  <br>  <3 |`|AA10383032	Is usually recommended to clean, tone and moisture our skin every day, if you are very young you may not need a lot of time treating specific areas, but for older people they have to take care of their skin around their eyes, use a night cream, a day cream with SPF, etc.<br>  <br>  The best skin and anti aging creams i have found are the ones make in New Zealand, they do not contain chemicals and contain the best natural ingredients available<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xtendlife.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.xtendlife.org</a>|`|lnpYQBbRaa	Every morning and night I wash my face with a gentle cleanser if I haven't been sweating. If I was, then I use a little bit more harsh soap. After my face is cleaned, I put on moisturizer. You should wash your face with warm water to open your pores, and then after you should splash cold water on your face to close them. Toners are thin liquids that you put on your face. They are very drying though, so only put it on spots with alot of oil.|`|iN9TGOgmaa	well<br>  im using this clearisal stuff<br>  but i just got it the other week, and i dont really like the way it works, it kinda hurts my skin<br>  but i recomend going to nordstroms and going the the clinique counter and ask for their 3 step face cleanser<br>  it works amazingly<br>  while i was using it i didnt have ONE blemish<br>  not one<br>  it was crazy<br>  and i wash my face 2 times a day bcuz acne filled skin is not attractive<br>  so i recomend using the clinique stuff at night, so it has longer to sit without makeup over it, and use stridex pads or another type like that in the morning<br>  and ur face will be GORGEOUS|`|M4KuBYLDaa	well people say that i have like perfect skin. this is what i do.<br>  i wash my face with soap and water.<br>  i dont get all of that fancy face stuff.<br>  and if i start to look oily, then i use oil blotting sheets that's about the extent of it.<br>  oh yeah, i dont wear make up either cause it can clog your pores if you wear too much|`|k6Aj3Palaa	oily skin - foam cleansers<br>  dry skin - milky cleansers.<br>  i used to have really bad skin in the 8th grade, now im 17, <br>  but now i rarely get any breakouts or anything. My face is glowing and pimple free. and good choice to stay away from the anti aging stuff, it ruins and harms your skin when you're young. Use it when you're like oldold, whenyou have your dark spots and the wrinkles etc. <br>  First of all, clean your face with the cleanser and rinse with warm water (use a tad warm water if you have really oily skin) then splash cold water to close th pores, that way it minimizes the chances of getting a breakout. I use clinque stuff, and i use aveeno toner. toner is to even out your complextion. I really recommend it. Also everyday i would put under my makeup before going to school oil-free lotion. if you want good skin, take the time and effort to take good care of it.<br>  oh yeah, and i use this clean&clear STEAM.so its basically Deep purifying formula, made with natural fruit acids, that works with your shower's steam to deeply cleanse your pores. hope that helps!  <br>  |`|pEyDW7aWaa	we use toner after cleanser to closes the pores<br>  <br>  here are some wonderful tips for you<br>  <br>  # eat lots of fruits and vegetables and no fast food drink lots of water and the food should be rich in minerals and vitamins<br>  <br>  # wash your skin about twice a day with a gentle clenser and warm water don't over wash and make shure you get all of the clenser off because if you don't it can clog pores and cause even more pimples<br>  <br>  # tone your skin with toner after you wash your face it helps to get off any excess clenser and closes pores<br>  # mostuireise your skin after you wash and tone it makes your skin soft and make shure you choose a moisturiser that won't clog your pores these ususaly come in a gel form<br>  # Resist the temptation to apply too much moisturizer. Skin experts warn that most women need only a light coating of moisturizer, applied nightly, to have perfect skin. When an excess of moisturizer is used that your skin does not need, it simply ends up clogging your pores.<br>  <br>  # Always wear sun screen, sunglasses and a hat when you go out in the sun.<br>  <br>  <br>  # Use a gentle exfoliator several times per week or, at most, only once each evening. Exfoliators are another overused beauty product that causes damage in excess. Their purpose is to gently scrub off the debris and carefully remove dead skin. You shouldn't consider exfoliators as sand paper for the skin that needs constant application.<br>  <br>  <br>   Treat your skin.

9Fu63PfSaa	reverse french with silver and black|`|vTeiG8Noaa	Do black nailpolish with silver accents (upside-down cresents and flowers look great, but this works with letters and hearts too) and a small, single rhinestone (though crystal or white opal works better, it depends on how much she's willing to pay) for that "formal" touch. I got this done with opals, it came out beautifully.  <br>  <br>  Black nail polish alone also looks great on long nails. So does silver for shorter nails.

fOIEpG72aa	bobby pins the same color as your hair.. put half your hair up first and and do the bottom half. working your way from bottom up. on the top half go from the inside out i usually leave my bangs and do something with them after i'm done with the rest. How to accomplish it: spray an inch thick strand of hair with hairspray. use a curling iron and spiral curl the strand. then taking the piece twirl it around your finger and then pin the O shaped piece to your head. practice makes perfect once you've gotten pretty good at it, you can even loop the O's together. i sometime add gems and diamonds when i'm all done to link pieces together and to cover up mess ups!

q2afAiUlaa	Alpha Hydroxy Acid. Sometimes this is known as fruit acid. It will exfoliate your skin by encouraging cell renewal. This is a great ingredient to have in a night cream as in the morning when you rinse your face in the shower, it will feel smoother. Not so great in a day cream as it may go bitty and mess up your makeup.

Gpp0bIkIaa	Well now that you have the skinny jeans and converse covered, you still have the top, accessories, hairstyle, and makeup style to work with . If you pair them with a feminine babydoll-style top or light colors, it will look more preppish. Also, you can also pair them with a nice v-neck sweater in a lighter color. As for accessories, pair it with bangles, long necklaces, and earrings that are a bit more dangly and etc. that arent studs and etc. As for makeup, dont cake it on or wear a lot of dark colors. sheer shades work well with nude lips and a dash of peachy blush. As for hairstyles, just go with your hair down or pin up the front pieces of your hair.

I don't follow trends so I wear whatever I feel like and whatever looks good on me. Whenever I see something I like and try it and I feel good in it then i'll buy it. I have different styles in a way, so i can be girly one day and preppy another or gangster one day and sporty the other; it really depends on what i feel like wearing or in the mood for. I think i might got my "style" from music since I listen to all kinds of music except country.
go9GnewQaa	Depending on if your Colour your hair or not i have 2 suggestions<br>  if you do not colour it should be easy(lack of frizzy).<br>  1. when your hair is nearly dry put a dollop of mouse on to your hair twist it into like a sausage and roll it up into a coil shape and pin with a kirby grip and blast with the hair dryer, leave it to cool completely and you will get the look of pic number 1.<br>  2. if you colour your hair and find it unmanageable try using a big barrel hair brush with fine bristles and wrap hair around the brush like a roller blast with hair dryer then leave it to cool spray with hair spray then unwind,just repeat over your head.<br>  3. Another way for lose crinkly girls is to pleat your hair again with mouse then spray to hold, leave it in over night for best results. but this can be a bit unpredictable and uneven, try to keep the pleats bigger on your longer HAIR and tighter and smaller on your top layers. good luck!|`|AjgZhYR8aa	Try Tigi's Catwalk product called Curls Rock: Curl Amplifier<br>  <a href="http://cdn.overstock.com/images/products/L10400204.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cdn.overstock.com/images/products...</a><br>  <br>  Rub about a dime-sized amount through your towel-dried hair and then blow-dry it using a diffuser.<br>  <a href="http://www.iosss.com/shopping/images/or1683.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.iosss.com/shopping/images/or1...</a><br>  <br>  If you use a good amount of that product, your hair might turn more curly instead of wavy [that's what mine does, anyway]. So try different amounts and see what it does.<br>  <br>  Then you could hairspray lightly with Tigi's Bed Head: Hard Head hairspray.
b9sacNU0aa	a nice blouse with a tie [: <br>  probably a skirt to go with it <br>  have fun at sadies`<3|`|J0UDzMCiaa	People dress according to theme at your school? Pfft thats weird! My schools theme was a Night in Candyland and no one dressed accordingly.<br>  Well, I suppose you could be a princess and wear a white slightly poofy dress and curl your hair if you're girly. Or you could be a barbie and wear a pink dress and have your hair like pin straight. There are a lot of possibilities, don't be something cookie cutter like a lawyer...but it you DO chose to be a lawyer, maybe wear like a sophisticated grey dress and put your hair in a loose bun with side bangs. Good luck and have fun! (:

09b59d1607e01cbe720ca32aeb38836eaa	Relaxing your hair will make it less poofy, but it takes extra work to keep your hair healthy.  It can be pricey, but worth it.  I live in the Washington, DC area and pay $65 for a relaxer.  It may cost more if you are having the process done for the first time, because they will have to put relaxer on all of your hair.  After the first time, they will only relax the new growth.<br>  <br>   It can cause breakage if you do not take care of your hair properly.  If you visit a stylist regularly, you shouldn't have a problem.<br>  <br>  I get my hair relaxed every 6 months.  This helps keep the poof down overall.  In between relaxers, I have my hair flatironed professionally every other week.<br>  <br>  If it weren't for humidity, I would only flat iron my hair.  Too bad any drop humidity totally ruins flat ironing.|`|b2a9a457ac370cdce08c3882ade501b8aa	Well if your hair is curly you can get it chemically relaxed. This straitens the hair which obviously makes it less poufy. It's terribly expensive and you have to have it done everyso often. It's terrible for your hair and if you don't continue getting it done the top of your hair will be curly while the bottom is strait. I don't reccomend it.

However, I do not know if you are male or female. If you are male, and straight, don't worry about it. There are lots & lots of women out there who love the fact that men have hairy bodies! If you are male & gay, there are many gay men out there who love their men with hair on their bodies. <br>  <br>  However, if you are female, I can understand why you are feeling distraught. Good news is there are tons of creams & home waxing kits out there. Sally Hanson makes a wonderful line of products to help out with body hair. Their products are very affordable, work well and you can purchase them almost anywhere. Wal-mart, CVS, Walgreens, Target and pretty much any drug store. <br>  <br>  Before you go to all that trouble, make sure the fuzziness is what is making you feel bad about yourself, and not something else. If you are a beautiful person on the inside, it will show on the outside. Anyone who cannot see that is blind.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!!!

I'm assuming this happens because you have both blue and green tones in your eyes, and certain colors around the eye (such as a shirt) would make one tone more noticeable than the other.

1UFPWdhKaa	Look, no one is perfect. Granted, genes make some people look like pepperoni pizzas whilst other look like the stepped off the cover of "Vogue", but its not your fault you have pimples. Always remember your true friends don't care what you look like, and that inner beauty is more important, whether your a girl or guy. There's a site for young girls; www.freewebs .com/reelbeauty11 , but it has great tips on there that can work for anyone.<br>  <br>  Check your habits. Do you prop up your chin with your hands? Thats asking for chin zits. Clean your specs often so you won't get pimples on the bridge of your nose.<br>  <br>  Don't pop them! If you want them to go away, make a paste of baking soda and water and dab it on the zit, then go to sleep. In the morning it should be dried up. Also, toothpaste or honey works for some people, but its not recommended.<br>  <br>  Every other day, use normal table salt and water to wash your face. The salt will scratch the dead skin off your face, and help prevent pimples. Don't scrub too hard, or it'll hurt.<br>  <br>  My brother gets zits all the time, so I'm somewhat of an 'expert', lol! Let me know if it works and if you need more help!|`|7TPFf2LRaa	Egg yolks work great!

okX7dyl0aa	Are you sure your hair is breaking or it's shedding.Shedding is loosing hairs from the root and normally you see a white bulb at the tip of the shedded hair.Breakage is hair breaking along the middle it doesn't have any bulb on it.If it's shedding you need to take hair vitamin supplements of check a doctor for any deficiency.Breakage can be formed from 2 things splits so check if you have any split ends that you have  to trim off or damaged,week hair in this case you need a protein treatment nexxus emergencee and aphogee 2 step protein treatment (this is a professional product but the smell isn't very pleasant maybe the previous will be better if you have smell issues) are good and have instant affects (just follow the directions to the T and make sure you use the moisturizing conditioner too whatever of the two you choose).<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sallybeauty.com/Protein-hair-Treatment/APHOGE4,default,pd.html?cgid=Hair02-03" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallybeauty.com/Protein-hair-...</a><br>  <br>  this one it's expensive but worth it<br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=304647&navAction=jump&navCount=0&id=prod1592830" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a><br>  <br>  another good one<br>  <a href="http://www.sallybeauty.com/loreal-hair-fix/SBS-500492,default,pd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallybeauty.com/loreal-hair-f...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  but also check your hair and see how hydrated it is it can be caused by dryness also but most approximate it would you will need the protein treatment cause relaxed hair lacks strength but pls don't forget to use a moisturizing/hydrating mask after these treatments cause they can dry out your hair.|`|2c3NGrxHaa	Do you straighten your hair? be carefull that you dont do it too often. As i lookd at a picture from around a year ago of myself and realised i have around half the amount of hair an im sure its through straightening.<br>  <br>  xx|`|sPeaaQ9Qaa	If you notice your hair is snapping off mid shaft or close to the scalp and is a clean break seemingly getting thinner, you could possibly have too much protein in your body.  Weather it’s a shampoo or conditioner you are using or if you are indeed ingesting too much of it.  I have a few clients who have done some weight loss programs with high protein diets, how happy they are with loosing weight however not so happy that the protein is also breaking their hair thinning it out.  <br>  Keratin is what human hair is made up of and this is a protein, too much of something is not a good thing.  So make sure that none of ur products are "protein builders" as this is possibly what's causing the problem.<br>  |`|0qQyDh85aa	Do you Blow dry it? <br>  Straighten it? <br>  Do you use Gel/Mousse/Hair Spray?<br>  Try Getting Pantene And Get a Leave in conditioner. <br>  Here is the Pantene site <br>  <a href="http://www.pantene.com/jsp/collection/index.jsp?locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantene.com/jsp/collection/in...</a><br>   It has breakage defense one that i think you should really look into.<br>  Its under relaxed and natural; Breakage Defense. <br>  There is also a Pro-V Restoratives One that has a few more choices. <br>  But i suggest the Relaxed and natural one. <br>  Usually you can but it at Walmart or K-Mart. <br>  <br>  Here are maybe why your hair is breaking:<br>  <br>  Hair can break when points in the hair thicken or weaken. Sometimes this happens near the scalp so a person's hair never grows very long. When hairs break at the ends, they're called "split ends," and the splits can travel up the hair shaft.<br>  Stress is also a cause.<br>  <br>  A major cause of hair breakage is improper use of chemical hair treatments, like the treatments described above. But brushing or combing hair too frequently or in the wrong way (such as using a fine-toothed comb on very thick, curly hair or teasing hair) can lead to breakage. Hair extensions and braids can also cause breakage. Leaving them in too long or pulling them out without professional help can cause hair and scalp damage or even hair loss.<br>  <br>  Sometimes hair breakage and dry, brittle hair are signs of a medical problem, such as hypothyroidism or an eating disorder. If your hair is breaking even though you don't treat it with chemicals or other styling products, see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Best Of Luck!!!|`|KhxIyJOcaa	try some intense conditioner (or a leave in one)<br>  your hair might be reacting to pollution in the air mixed with the drop in temp.<br>  x|`|fYI1I8Bdaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It could be alot of different things..........but the main thing is to try to stop it before it get worst.<br>  <br>  I had a similar problem..............and realized my hair needed moisture and the elasticity was shot...........so I had to build it back up with supplements..............(that worked on the inside)..........and the right topical shampoo & conditioner (that worked on the outside) equals proper balance.<br>  <br>  Pantene was advertising a new shampoo and conditioner called Beautiful Lengths...............This shampoo is suppose to stop falling hair and split ends.............I said.......yeah.......right!

EttOSBY4aa	The most important thing is to be confident in yourself. If you act proud of who you are and the way you look, then others will respect you. Also, you can wear clothes that will minimize your breasts- Get a bra that fits correctly and is not a push-up bra, and don't wear clothing that fits too tightly or is too low cut. If your   breasts are not too obvious, your peers will focus on your face and personality, not your body. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp;jsessionid=8E3905E01ACDFE221AF231A22CAA8F57.app11-node5?itemdescription=true&itemCount=60&id=14972574&parentid=W_COLL_FEMDETAILS&sortProperties=&navCount=42&navAction=poppushpush&color=" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...</a><br>  <br>  ^This top is loose fitting and not low-cut, so it will make you feel more comfortable.|`|24cUKZDgaa	Uhm , woahh. <br>  That's sad . I wouldn't really know what to tell you though , I'm flat . Hahas. But um , talk to a counselor at your school about it , and be careful about what you wear , you don't want to be waring a real low cut shirt (etc . ) <br>  And tell those guys to fack off.  Straight to their faces , that's disgusting and they shouldn't be doing anything like that .<br>  <br>  Peytonn. = )|`|NoKc2mU5aa	My friends are DD And they pull attenition away from it by direecting everything to there bum<br>  im lucky im 32AA<br>  were 14 as well<br>  they also wear a sports bra wich makes them look smaller|`|wcyBfJXVaa	These boys in your school are really immature, but that's expected when they're 13. I promise, guys get better as they age. However, this should be considered sexual harassment and you should tell an adult, perhaps your school counselor. Hopefully this would stop the actions of these boys. As for running, I suggest you buy a comfortable bra that supports your breasts fully. Try a good sports bra.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't hate your breasts. I know many women who desire big breasts. Learn to love yourself!|`|fzucd5nnaa	I'm a DD myself so I know your pain. First I would get a sports bra for Gym class, and if you think it is comfortable enough for every day use. Second, Many companies sell "minimizer" bras that literally minimize the appearance of your breasts. They can be a little costly, but are worth it for the comfort.|`|x0BHrCcoaa	omg i have the same problem they be squeezin the heck out them when they hug me and some even get hard off dem....everybody thinks big boobs are a gift but they really not cuz there annoyin|`|wzuDxwXdaa	wear sports bras all the time! if your mom lets you, talk to her about getting a lot of sports bras.

HsvBInbRaa	Well Im 5'7'' and 125lbs. My fitness instructor says thats the perfect weight for my body. Being 5' I would guess you should weigh around 100lbs. Your not too big but there is definitly room for improvement|`|FFr1GVDzaa	no.thats about me and i dont think im fat.and i kno pple r gonna hate on u so:PPLE!!STOP HATIN ON THIS PERSON!!! :) :) :)|`|l3BZ90RUaa	No you are not. Your actually within your weight. I believe it's 110 to 125.|`|o63EDP3Jaa	Yes, you are very much overweight. You must look like a beached whale. I'm surprised you go out in public like that. Forget diets and exercising, you need to opt straight for Gastric Bypass. You need to gain control of your eating and control of your lifestyle. Hopefully you get the procedure done before your life is in serious danger.<br>  <br>  Also, I'm kidding. From your description, you're pretty thin, but I'm not here to boost your self-esteem. The only person who can decide whether or not you're "too fat" is you. Don't compare yourself to anybody else. Love your body for whatever size you are and stop posting such stupid questions.<br>  <br>  If it's an issue of muffin-tops or your bra strap being too tight and making your back look fat, you need to find clothes that fit you better. Both issues are not "fat" issues, they're "fit" issues.<br>  <br>  If you still believe you're too heavy, try working out or running. Not only will you tighten up, you'll also feel great in general.|`|pdl55IbRaa	Hii I suggest going onto kidshealth.org and then click the kids ones..Next search for BMI ( Body mass index) and then it will ask you some question like gender age height weight...and then it will tell you if you are underweight, at a healthy weight, or overweight<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|TazrGnjgaa	No, you're okay.

PzHi9vxHaa	In teoria, per allenare le spalle e allargarle la piscina va benissimo e non ti costringe a seguire sequenze, ripetizioni e a stare attento a mantenere un buono "stile" negli esercizi, ma è anche parecchio ripetitivo e, per gente come me, andare in piscina e mettersi a fare "le vasche" (come *devi* fare perché serva a qualcosa) è di una noia mortale.<br>  <br>  Se vai in palestra, invece, la cosa è parecchio più variata, ma, appunto, devi seguire routines abbastanza precise (l'istruttore della palestra sarà felice di farti una scheda personalizzata).<br>  <br>  Un'alternativa che consiglio di provare, se trovi la cosa nelle vicinanze, è una classe di rowing. Si tratta essenzialmente di un vogatore moderno, ma viene fatto come un corso, con l'istruttore che dà il ritmo, con sottofondo musicale ed è abbastanza variato da far passare rapidamente il tempo.<br>  <br>  In generale il consiglio è:<br>  Indipendentemente da ciò che *in teoria* sarebbe la cosa migliore cerca di scegliere una cosa che *ti piaccia* fare, altrimenti smetti dopo un mese e non serve a nulla (tranne buttare i soldi).<br>  Sulla stessa linea: se trovi gente simpatica con cui andare questo ti sarà di grosso aiuto nei momenti (e arriveranno!) nei quali "proprio non ti va" di andare.|`|df5767441642dacb5c13eb44dcbbc194aa	Assolutamente piscina, alleni tutti i muscoli assieme|`|d771d6994efc132d9f87e3b55a649e99aa	piscina<br>  |`|JzsoiAmiaa	Vai in piscina in questo modo si forma la massa muscolare e si fanno le spalle grandi....io sono 1.75 e peso 73 kg però ho ancora 13 anni e sto pensando di andare anche io in piscina per fare un bel fisico...<br>  <br>  ciao|`|5Z6uXCbWaa	ciaooooooo.....piscina sicuramenteeeee!!!!!!scolpisce molto di più!!!!!e poi è quello secondo me + divertente della palestra!!!!poi devi vedere tu se ti piace di più il nuoto o la palestra!!!!!baciooooo enormeeee!!!!!|`|BdubS06Yaa	si piscina.........sicuramente|`|hU9UsUKpaa	Io pratico nuoto a livello agonistico tutti i giorni e in effetti ho le spalle larghe e un fisico asciutto.

Cucumber slices on your eyes for at least fifteen minutes 2. Apply used tea bags after they have cooled. I've had friends tell me these work I've never tried them. There is a line by Olay I believe called Regenerist and I believe there is cream for discoloration around the eyes. Hope this helps.|`|ec70d1896a438624a99a95b3d56b31d3aa	whitening creams from Loreal and wrinkles decrease cream also from Loreal |`|lHOmVfaOaa	Don't use hemoroid cream!

Ao5aSAWiaa	No, it doesn't make your hair change to grey or white faster. But it does strip the nutrients from your scalp and make your hair fall out faster. So you might start balding sooner than most people.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would lay off. Bleaching your hair is not good for your hair at all,  it's extremely damaging, so lay off the dye for a year or two and let your scalp relax and heal.<br>  <br>  To get your hair back to the natural color, you have to wait. You bleached it so it's not like that hair will ever go back to normal. Cut it off and let it grow out again, natural healthy hair. Get a deep conditioning to get the nutrients back into your hair so it'll get shiny again.|`|ZClQQIGcaa	I've never heard that it turns grey or white..<br>  to get the nutrients back use baby shampoo, yes it's sounds weird but I dyed my hair too many times and now I'm using baby shampoo and my hair is so soft and healthier.. :)|`|ugWmfSMlaa	well i didnt read the entire thing, but no, it doesnt go grey, at least not that ive ever seen. <br>  it just falls out and gives you cancer.<br>  thats all. so dont do it too much whatsoever.|`|VtAiKvXiaa	you are still very young and if you don't put any more treatment on your hair it will grow out its natural colour and natural oils will keep it in good condition. <br>  over colouring your hair will cause it to dry out and snap, but it will not go grey naturally.<br>  bleaching your hair repeatedly strips the oils from your hair and your hair will go like wet cotton wool. and you should not mix opposite colours such as the reds in the brown dye and the Blonde will make orange, as you are aware. some times using one colour on the top Of another will give this red/orange effect or a green/grey effect . this is probably what you are seeing now.<br>  in a few days you will see your natural colour growing back threw if you can leave your hair alone. |`|iSL6KcHYaa	You'll find the more you dye your hair, the darker your roots will be when it starts to grow out.<br>  I've dyed my hair many times also, from a light blonde and my roots look a greyish brown, there's no way of getting back to your natural colour, as the root colour you have now is your natural tone.<br>  The only thing you could do to get that colour is to continuously dye it, and i'm guessing you don't want to do that :)

yh0ETjDlaa	make sure you buy a straightener that has ceramic plates, or something like a Chi straightner that doesn't burn your hair as much. make sure your hair air drys before trying to straighten it. in the mean time, these are some tips for:<br>  <br>  dry hair:<br>  1) use less or no heat. When blow drying, use a cooler setting and do not blow dry until the is completely dry. <br>  2) Use acidifiers. Acidifiers close the cuticle down and lock in moisture. Acidifiers have a pH of 2.5 to 3.5. They have a lower pH than hair does in an aqueous solution. <br>  <br>  3) Color, perms, relaxers, and other chemicals are sometimes a necessary evil. They rob the hair of humectants. Humectants attract and retain moisture (water) in the cortical layer of the hair. Try to use low ammonia -low peroxide color. Do not leave neutralizer on too long with perms. If possible avoid relaxers. <br>  <br>  4) Treat your hair. Replace lost humectants with essential fatty acids (lipids), acidify your hair, use low        pH products, use cool water. Replace what was taken out to make your hair dry. Also eat a diet full of essential fatty acids (in moderation and non-animal {no cholesterol}).<br>  <br>  damaged hair:<br>  <br>  1) Use a thermal protector when using heat. See "thermal protectors" under conditioners <br>  2) Do not blow dry the hair completely dry. Leave a little moisture in. <br>  3) Use a conditioner with U.V. protectors built in. <br>  4) Use a low or no ammonia hair color. <br>  5) Air oxidize perms instead of using the neutralizer. <br>  6) Never brush wet or damp hair. Use a wide toothed comb. See "tools" <br>  7) On dry hair use a boars hair brush and start at the ends and work up. <br>  8) Clarify your hair after you swim. <br>  9) Blow dry on the "cool" setting. <br>  10) Eat protein rich foods (chicken, fish, nuts) - Eat foods rich in essential fatty acids (not from animal sources [they contain cholesterol]-only from botanical sources) - <br>  <br>  split ends:<br>  <br>  Shampoo hair and use a moisturizing formula like Phytojoba or similar.   <br>  Use a good rinse out conditioner making sure to slather the ends where the splits exist. <br>  Rinse well and then do a cool to cold rinse to seal the hair's cuticles and ends, adding instant sleekness and glossiness. <br>  Towel blot and then apply your favorite leave-in conditioner like Phyto 7, Phyto 9 or similar to your damp tresses. <br>  Detangle your strands with a wide tooth comb. <br>  Pour a pea sized drop of shine serum like Phytolisse or Robert Hallowell's Shine Drops Serum into the balms of your hands.   <br>  Glide your serum coated hands over the ends of your hair making sure to focus more serum on the most frayed ends of your hair. <br>  Use a large paddle or round brush and a blow dryer and blow your hair completely dry. <br>  Make sure that the split end areas are dried as straight as possible since splits look worse when they are allowed to wave, curl, frizz or spike out. <br>  When your hair is 100% dry apply a light layer of heat protectant spray or product.  Then use a ceramic or teflon flat iron to flat-iron the bottom 1 1/2 to 2 inches of your tresses from side to side.   <br>  <br>  sorry, that's kind of a lot of information, but in the end you're beautiful hair will win out!|`|JHmiI1iSaa	To really get the right sting for your hair try talking to your hair stylist about teh problem.

If you seriously have to, we wary to only apply it to the very roots o your hair. Use tons of  conditioner and hair masks and leave in products designed for your hair. I'd go to the local hair salon and buy some products. While the products that work might be expensive, it's better then contantly buying cheap products that don't work.|`|AAQ5Hbcdaa	I here putting mayo in your hair helps<br>  And eggs too..  i tried putting two eggs in my hair for half an hour hour ... but it didnt really help, hopefully it'll do something to your hair!|`|8WPE6uyoaa	Don't treat your hair that way.|`|jh3A4y5uaa	ok, 1st of all, breathe. thats right. you need to relax. stress can make more hair fall out.<br>  <br>  2nd of all, get the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair. itll say damaged, repair, fried, and/or thin in the description. a combo is best.<br>  <br>  3rd, use a comb, not a brush<br>  <br>  4th, every couple weeks, follow this formula:<br>  <br>  o    1 teaspoon light oil, such as almond, canola or sunflower<br>  o    1 egg<br>  o    1 tablespoon honey<br>  o    1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Mix together all the ingredients, and stir thoroughly. To use: Massage the mixture into just-shampooed, damp hair. Wrap your hair in plastic wrap or use a plastic shower cap, and leave the conditioner on your hair for 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair again, and rinse well. Makes 2 ounces, enough for one treatment.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|uZuxWnq0aa	I have the same problem, but don't worry it's just where your hair is split .. that's why it's falling out (I HOPE) That's my theory atleast jeje.<br>  <br>  Just stop using your flat iron for a while and get a trim.

Help is on the way.  Try the Ojon Hydrating Thickening line.  Not only does it improve your hair's quality, it smells amazing and has no sulfates or other no-so-good for your hair stuff.  The regime I would suggest to you:  Hydrating Thickening Shampoo and Condidtioner (cleansing), Rejuvinating Leave-In Conditioner (put it on your ends before drying), High-Gloss Styling Cream (apply on wet hair) and Tunu Elastik Finishing Spray.  Also, I'd recommend investing in the Ojon Restorative Treatment (use once/wk leave in overnight).  It's pricey, but it lasts forever and it will save your hair.  These products are available at Sephora.com. QVC.com (they have the best prices on the kits) and Ulta.  Good luck!  Let me know how it works.

Thats it.<br>  Oh and lip gloss to - of course.|`|AgzRyqWTaa	Lip gloss is fine they need it to keep their lips moist' buy the fruity type she will feel special.Tell her you will bargain with her, no mascara or eye shadow for nail polish every weekend.Change the color each time but when it's school time the nail polish remover should come in handy.|`|r4i7xPnMaa	A little lipgloss is okay, maybe mascara and eyeshadow on special occasions, provided it isn't too over the top.<br>  <br>  People wear makeup to have the kind of complexion you have now. If you feel like you need to wear makeup, keep it subtle.|`|nAlyuyaDaa	What you're doing is fine.  Just don't wear much more.  You're still a kid!  It's fine to experiment and play around a little because that's how you'll learn what to like and how to apply, but don't be too heavy handed or you'll look like you're trying too hard.  Have fun and enjoy being young!|`|9hC7bbf7aa	It all depends the maturity level, as long as they take a good care of skin by washing off make up thoroughly at night. I don't like to generalize just by age. If the young person thinks she could use a bit of make up, fine, IMO.<br>  |`|6jZcr33paa	I started wearing make up when I was 12.
CHbkSmQoaa	You may have bought at tie that is too long...but you may have also tied it wrong.  <br>  <br>  Try shortening up the narrow end when you tie it.  Try starting with the narrow end somewhere around the middle of your chest.  Right near the sternum.<br>  <br>  A good fitting tie should have the back just short of the front.  If that does not work (and it may take practice) you can always tuck the narrow back end into your shirt.  Although this is somewhat of a fashion "no-no"...but it'll do the trick.|`|7246253f10b3c63eb3f0f3e8b3e6ebdeaa	Tuck a little bit of it in the front of your pants..|`|e79dbf3e1ede8ecee463f1f9576151acaa	feel confident and tuck the end between a couple of the top buttons!
hSzSj5S0aa	I had pretty good luck with the neutrogena rapid clear 2-in-1 fight & fade gel. It depends on how many pimples you have & how big they are. I had a medium sized pimple a couple of weeks ago & used the rapid clear gel & it was gone in under 2 days. Since you have a lot of pimples that you need to clear up it might best to try something else. I use neutrogena skin id & it works great! But the rapid clear should work well for you at clearing up an occasional pimple.|`|uzWYTQfeaa	Apply some concealer and it will hide them. Justin Timberlake and all the hot stars use it.<br>  <br>  They also sell some over the counter stuff to help with hiding them if they haven't gone away by the time you want them gone :D|`|XYx8zGbnaa	Use the pimple treatment but make sure that you drink plenty of water.<br>  The water helps to flush out your system and helps to get rid of toxins.<br>  |`|0bLECoZ4aa	Well this depends on your skin type, because everyone has a different skin type it’s hard to differ. Though there are ways in keeping your skin healthy. Wash your face every morning when you can, try to make sure it’s not oily, probably use some face washes. Don’t eat a lot of oily foods in the day and drink a lot of water.  Look for face washes that contain ‘benzoyl peroxide’ because it’s good for getting rid of pimples. Neutrogena spot gel will take at least a week to take effect of getting rid only most of your pimples, you have to try it out to know the results though.<br>  <br>  x.<br>  |`|TazrGnjgaa	I will tell you right now that there is NO product that will clear up your face in two days. If you REALLY need them gone, cover them up with a clean, nonclogging/pimple causing concealer or something. I've dealt with pimples for four years so far, and maybe there IS a miracle product out there less than 10 bucks.<br>  <br>  If you're willing to go over your budget, use Khiel's Blue Herbal Gel for a day and night cleanser, tone with Eau Thermale, and moisturize. Treat it when Paula Wexler MD Acnescription Spot Treatment. My scars and live acne disappeared in about four/five days? It's great.<br>  <br>  That's my best bet for you, but if you really can't go over your budget, go on neutrogena.com and there will be a link where you answer questions about your skin type and give you products you can use to clear up your skin. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|V99HdM0Haa	No.  Use Oxy 10
nbWO3IANaa	Not 'tight' but form fitting.<br>  Try fitted Alines, pencil skirts, snug jeans.<br>  Men LOVE ' child bearing hips' cause they are curvy, and gives then something to grab!|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Mmm child-bearing hips are sexy!|`|l6XvHv4Uaa	I have big hips (early 20's) but am very skinny.. Boys love hips back before I got married to my hubby I would get SO much attention from guys that loved my body (because I had the hips that showed off my body well) Show em off girl!|`|AA11179275	Yeah i think they are. I rarely look in a magazine and want to look like the sickly models. Curves are awesome and you should show them off... I don't know if a skirt would tho.... maybe good fitting jeans |`|ZR2iH33Maa	Child bearing hips are good. It means you'll be less likely to have problems giving birth without a C-section.<br>  I think you should wear pencil skirts and snug slacks to show off your wide hips. ^-^|`|YhsNLTeEaa	its true!!!!!|`|WJDqbCvtaa	It's all about individual preference, and it's great that your husband loves your physical attributes. <br>  <br>  Pencil skirts are good for emphasis, so are hip-hugging pants or form-fitting dresses. Basically, any clothing that isn't baggy or sagging around the waist and hips should please your hubby. :)|`|YqoyBXMbaa	i have hips and a kinda big bootay and pants fit everywhere except they're tight on my bootay and hips but perfect on my stomach and legs and length! but since they're to tight there i have to get bigger pants/ shorts/ skirts and so nothing fits! but i have many admirers|`|PKBwX4bQaa	if your husband thinks your hips are sexy than work with them and use them to your advantage - don't hide them! wear tight skirts - but in dark colors so they're not see thru|`|dvjPqKMvaa	yea pencil skirts, dress pants, anything tight on the hips but not so tight everywhere else.
456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Hot means you are sexually attractive. That's all.<br>  Beautiful means you are pretty, especially in an elegant way.  It doesn't necessarily mean you are sexually attractive though.<br>  <br>  When I think of someone beautiful, I think of women like Cate Blanchett and Nicole Kidman though I don't think either are hot at all.|`|AA11327039	In my opinion, hot refers to looks only.<br>  <br>  Beautiful means the whole package; personality and looks|`|RGdZYbNkaa	calling someone hot is treating them as an object. its a physical attraction, not a personal attraction. basically, someone you want to get with because they're attractive, but nothing new.<br>  <br>  calling someone beautiful is a more well-rounded compliment. the person stands out because they are attractive in a unique way. the person is viewed more as an individual that just an object.|`|SyyWIe14aa	LOL  no name is soo right<br>  <br>  beautiful is something a muture guy says, and it means u look stunning and gorgeous<br>  being called hot has different meanings, it depends on the guy<br>  like perverted guys call whores hot<br>  while normal highschool guys call about every girl hot<br>  <br>  but i  would rather be called beautiful    but i like cute better|`|qAoR7iPyaa	i would rather be called beautiful but hot is good too :P<br>  <br>  and i think hot just means looks and your average model looking girl<br>  but beautiful really comes from the heart and means so much more. attitude, looks, personality. and thats when you know its love|`|Ik3hycuRaa	I think "you're hot" is more like you are sexy. And beautiful is very pretty. I think I'd rather be beautiful.|`|hCsAHDjNaa	I always get you're really hot too, I only got beautiful once, by a longtime boyfriend, and my theory is that most guys are too immature and intimidated by beautiful to use it when they want to. I think is more dramatic, and it is refferring to someone being breathtakingly pretty, and often it means inner and outer beauty. It almost seems like beautiful comes with some sort of guarentees from a guy, and most guys are afraid they're making some type of committment. Where as hot is something any guy can go around saying to every attractive girl they see, with no strings attatched. Its like when you're in the mall or somewhere and you see a lot of attractive guys that you'd consider hot, but you don't have any sort of emotinal attatchment to any of them. I guess beautiful is just more of a sentimental, emotional thing. I think you have to know who someone truly is before you can tell if they are beautiful. But, I promise you, you'll find the right guy, and he'll think you're beautiful beyond belief :D & when you find the right guy, you'll never get sick of hearing him tell you you're beautiful. Its a great feeling, and your time will come :D|`|OdDbR4Psaa	HOT<br>  * Sexy (more likely in a slutty way)<br>  * Sexually and physically attractive<br>  * "Damn, I wanna f*ck you"<br>  <br>  BEAUTIFUL <br>  * Pretty (in a more innocent way)<br>  * Also refers to the beauty inside a persons personality, mind, and heart - not just what's on the outside<br>  * Pleasing and gorgeous but not necessarily sexually attractive|`|4PDegJoyaa	when a dude tells u ur hot that just means he wants to mess with u basically. ur hot. basically use you in my eyes. NOT hat its not nice to hear but for a man, not a boy, to call you beautiful is alot sweeter and alot more proper sounding. A little boy will tell u ur a hot. a man will tell u ur beautiful. Ive been with my b/f, or hubby, for 3 years. I'm 17 and to this day he doesnt say that to me he tells me im beautiful. So beautiful is a more sweeter sounding phrase. And if boys aren't telling u your beautiful your not talking to the right dudes. Don't let any man 0r boy tell u anything but ur the most beautiful thing. |`|0EBWEebAaa	hot is when a guy says wen hes picturing you in bed with him giving him what he wants (SEX from you really bad), beautiful is what a guy says when he likes the color of your eyes and the way you smile hot is more of a compliment (:|`|4SCgeHYIaa	I'd rather be called beautiful. It seems more from the heart, like from someone who really cares. When Iget called hot I feel a bit unclean, not sure why. I feel like they're objectifying me.<br>  <br>  Both are compliments though tbf, and I call guys hot all the time :D<br>  |`|2J5Zb7ubaa	 hot: having a relatively high temperature xD. (the guy prolly wants to do   some sleeping *wink*)<br>   beautiful: immensely pretty. he prolly luvs you. |`|AA11179275	Hot is like someone who is young saying it, while your beautiful is a guy who is trying to impress you and more mature |`|vH0REw0baa	Hott = quickie<br>  Beautiful - something real|`|vuigLFByaa	Hot often refers to the body and beautiful to the face. If you have nice hair and a nice body and a reasonably pretty face you may be hot, but if you have a really nice face but your body isnt really much or your hair maybe you'd get called beautiful. <br>  <br>  Also beautiful is often used when two people are in a long term reltionship but hot is more flirty. Hope this helps :D xxxxx|`|yOLhFmZDaa	hot to a guy is like if hey where rating you on a scale of 1-10 you would be an 11 you are super pretty and all the guys like you. Beautiful is when a guy that you are dating is telling you that he loves you a lot and he think you are very pretty.hot is a word that guys that you aren't dating use and beautiful is for someone who really loves you. i think that i would rather be called beautiful because i know that that person really likes me and it is not just a stage or something like that!|`|G4pU8v6Yaa	Guys who say "you're hot" are not as worthy as those who say "you're beautiful". "You're beautiful" is just more mature and genuine. Definitely go for a guy that would call you beautiful over hot. Not that hot is bad its just a sign of a horny teenage boy |`|9cYfJIx8aa	to me, hot would be like your body is nice,<br>  and of course your face is good too.<br>  <br>  but being called beautiful is all about the face[:<br>  your eyes, lips, nose, cheek bones, shape,ect.<br>  it means your face is just pretty.<br>  <br>  i much rather be called beautiful.|`|mMVCpswxaa	i would rather be called beautiful it makes me feel more cared for. while hot makes me feel more hey your sexy i don't care for your personality like a barbie kinda plastic feeling. beautiful makes me feel more real.|`|cdeYOsKbaa	"your hot"<br>  is something a horny teen says<br>  "your beauty is Simply stunning"<br>  is something a gentleman says|`|W5mtFz9saa	Hot means, they're only thinking about the physical later.<br>  Beautiful means they think you're beautiful inside and out.<br>  I like being called both but really appriciate beautiful.:D|`|VULWNyQLaa	Hot is when a guy is just trying to sleep with you<br>  Beautiful is when a guy is being sincere about your beauty! :)|`|PaTlH9DZaa	hot is what a jerk might say (no offense) <br>  beautiful is what someone who really likes you says<br>  i'd rather b called beautiful|`|Vk1IoJMLaa	well for one, good for you ! =D <br>  HOTT; to be very sexy and pretty <br>  BEAUTIFUL: to be of immence beauty .. inside or out. 
AA10383032	Well, if you could buy from an online store i would strongly recommend the best natural creams from:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xtendlife.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.xtendlife.org</a>|`|2yL1T2Vlaa	Sally's Beauty supplies, or Avon.

d6RQN2QWaa	The only lotion I've found that actually helps my dry skin is St. Ives.  I prefer the vanilla scented one, but even the Skin Firming one works for me.  Most other lotions don't do anything to help my dry skin, even when used daily.<br>  <br>  I don't know of a good face cream to hide fine lines though, sorry.|`|RPpXarDDaa	A lotion that will help dry skin needs to be thick something like abody butter that offers a lot of moisture, And if that doesn't work you can add a little oil to your lotion.

U can mix equal qty of olive oil and honey and massage on face and body. Keep overnight and in the morning wash with lukewarm water. This will hydrate the skin.

PCbGPDHwaa	Hmm, I'm going to suggest going to a cheaper store to get clothes since you are not sure of your new style yet.  That said probably places like H & M, Forever 21, Old Navy, Ross, TJ Maxx, Wet Seal, and Charlotte Russe might be a good place to check out.   You can also sometimes get great deals on clothes from department stores when they have sales and what-not. <br>  <br>  If you don't like to dress like a guy, try a skirt.  It doesn't have to be short and fancy, a plain black pencil skirt that comes down to your knees is feminine and sexy and can be gotten at a decent price.  If where you live is cold, just add some colored or patterned tights.

b2880eb111e76d7ad1846116d6059b0baa	some brunette made it up lol|`|9wkGR8nlaa	This is the way that I was told how it started.<br>  Blonde hair is light, which was said to be because it was lightened from the sun. Lighter hair from the dangerous rays of the sun could then mean that the head is then more susceptible to dangerous rays from the sun. These rays from the sun then affects the brain and can make you dumber..<br>  Something like that, it's not true though lol.|`|AA12384115	According to this YouTube video, this is how blond jokes got started. I doubt it but, it is a hilarious video.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ERN1BaKk2I&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ERN1BaKk...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know how to make the link blue so that you can click to the link. But, see the video. The video is called, "Where blond jokes come from..."|`|LtqikbEBaa	because MOST of<br>  them act ditzy<br>  and dumb to look cute<br>  so we just call them dumb.|`|Py6s4pf4aa	I actually read somewhere, this is pretty interesting, that many babies start out blonde, when they are  born. But many end up developing darker hair by the time they reach toddler years. Therefore, in history, blond hair has represented innocence, because, theoretically if you retained your baby blonde hair, you are more like a baby.<br>  <br>  Baby= not super intelligent, naive, not wise to the world, super-unexperienced.<br>  <br>  This is where the stereotype originated. Hope that helps.|`|BS8vS4q2aa	OMG I have no idea why people call me dumb blonde<br>  but i love it any way lol<br>  BUT OMG SOME JOKES ARE HARSH<br>  Jakie is not dumb (loser in my class)<br>  she always says hard words i dont under stand <br>  and i aleays say WTH are you going on about<br>  when she tells me i still dont get it|`|0FF07ENjaa	scientific facts by Dr. liverstine found that they have a lot of air in their hair which creates the color and the air somehow pushed into their brain creating the...|`|gXcKf42Taa	WELL ACTUALLY I KNOW THIS ONE. <br>  <br>  in rome, prostitutes all died their hair blonde. and then "blondes have more fun" came from that. and then prostitutes= slutty= airhead. |`|yImAmu24aa	Its because there are trying to act cute and Lovely and beautiful .

I think it's because you realize that they act all ditzy and because of early Hollywood influence. |`|b1RgKHoiaa	i know that's so stereotypical......But people think so because some act really preppy and like the "omGG" type ...yuo know like :"omGG where did yuo get that ring":|`|sHKt27ysaa	Some just are dumb like the valley girl talk they sound ridiculous and most are retarded.|`|YMUJZqJTaa	Because most of them are.
WYa3UY6Gaa	No you wont bleed to death. When you drink before getting a tattoo they say you will bleed more, but no you wont bleed to death.<br>  <br>  [ I dont know if the whole bleeding more is true I have just heard it ]<br>  <br>  Most places will not recommend drinking before getting tattooed. most places won't tattoo you if you are noticeably intoxicated. Drunk people quite often become rude and obnoxious, move around a lot and tend to make poor decisions that they may regret in the future (like a tattoo they would not have gotten while sober.)|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Anything that damages your body, like drinking or smoking, will slow down healing and drinking before or right after will thin your blood leading to extra scabbing and color fallout. When my mother was 17, young and stupid, she had a couple of beers and then went and got a tattoo, then went back for another beer she had two sips before she realized that the sleeve on her navy whites was completely soaked through with blood.<br>  <br>  It's a bad idea.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	No you won't bleed to death. Alcohol does thin your blood over time though. So if you drink a lot on a regular basis you are more likely to bleed while getting the tattoo. Smoking has no effect on it. Some places will let you take a smoke break if you are getting a large piece that takes a long amount of time. But most tattoo shops will not tattoo you if you have been drinking before you enter their shop. The place I go to will not tattoo or pierce anyone who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.|`|c506JMjMaa	Nope!<br>  That's like saying if you smoke or drink and fall and cut yourself will you bleed to death!<br>  <br>  The reason that tattooists say not to drink are:<br>  1. It impairs your judgment so you may chose something that you don't really want.<br>  2. The tattoo will bleed a little more after alcohol as alcohol thins the blood, which means that there's a higher chance of the ink leaking from your tattoo, thus you could end up with a tattoo that's patchy and missing bits!<br>  3. Drunk people are generally harder to keep still/ less well behaved thus making them harder to tattoo and increasing the risk of a tattoo going bad (ie. tattooist slipping, tattooing too deep etc)<br>  <br>  Smoking is perfectly fine however, that has no affect whatsoever!<br>  |`|bEkfROZraa	no you wont bleed to death, but it can mess up your tattoo due to excesses bleeding. your tattoo will probably be blurry and the ink can be discolored. The pain isnt that bad so just suck it up.|`|AA11901859	no, lol. the reason that they tell you not to do either of those things before you get a tattoo is because the color on the tattoo will fade easier|`|959ae1bdd947a1c1f297becbcc6fb6f0aa	its bout the same when ur str8 or drinkin n smoking the only thing u have  2 watch is that u or the person doesnt passed out but its always good to be str8 n if it your 1st can take sumfink sweeet like a chocolate or sumfink like that u can eat y they r doin it...<br>  <br>  im an a tattooist now and i have done a few of me work mates that have been drinkin and r quite drunk lol but u bleed about the same |`|TqG6v6ZKaa	if you drink before you get a tattoo it'll thin out your blood and it'll tend to bleed alot more and might take a bit longer to heal. plus if youre drunk or high when you go get one i feel like you might get fidgety and move around and that'll screw it up and then youre stuck with it haha. |`|9RhPrJQYaa	No. The blood will be thinner but that is about it.  Unless you drink to much and most tattoo artist will not tattoo you if you have been drinking or using some sort of drugs. |`|HZHvtI8faa	try it and report back.

hmzMd5TLaa	I love making my hair messy and wavy.<br>  <br>  You need a curling iron and heat protectant spray for this one.<br>  <br>  First, spray your hair with the protectant. Then, grab 1/2 to 2 inch pieces of hair (depending on how tight you want your waves to be) and curl them, leaving at least two inches of your ends out of the clamp of the curling iron. Hold for 15-30 seconds, and repeat with your whole head.|`|rq768sdnaa	Some people like the Straight short kind. And some like the straight long.

805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	Go darker. Your skin tones suggest a darker hair color than what you currently have, you hair is currently dominated by yoour highlighting and its too much. Go really sparce on the highlighting, you only need a trace or two: In this case less (highlighting) is more and a darker overall hairtone will make your face stand out better, and you have a nice face.|`|OSD5by7Oaa	leave it:)|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I think you could go a little darker, but not too dark. Maybe you could just go back to your natural light brown hair with blonde highlights just framing your face. Or if you'd be willing to go a little darker, maybe you could try a medium brown with lighter brown or dark blonde highlights.|`|tJ2lzTSmaa	I think you would look really good with dark red hair ,lindsay lohan has this dark color but it might be considered dark brown|`|AA11402528	that looks weird cus your hairs blonde but your eyebrows are dark..you should dye it dark brown|`|iAphlpqKaa	i think dark hair would look good,a nd a little shorter too with layers|`|i4reNWXeaa	So, I definitely think that you would look really pretty with....<br>  <a href="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/users/10/105309/46_2007/15152095.preview_0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.teamsugar.com/files/users/...</a><br>  or this...<br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/womenshair/1/0/C/2/-/-/MileyCyrus.FrazerHarrison.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/womenshair/1/0/C/2/...</a><br>  So like a darker brown with maybe a hint of red to it.|`|3APf8nAIaa	leave your hair blondee<br>  <br>  just add some black highlights at the end ;)|`|saIIuPOhaa	Honestly, I think you could pull off any color.

WqkFJ2Pgaa	I'm a 24 year old mom, and I feel the same way. I buy about half my clothes in the juniors department and half in the womens, but it takes a lot longer to find something appropriate than it used to. I like Kohls and TJ Maxx for grown-up-but-not-middle-aged clothes.|`|XCQDebdtaa	Well, I certainly understand your question and how frustrating it can be, but I can't really help you out as far as trendy things go. I've had to go to specialty stores or shop in the men's department to find clothes for a gal of my height and attributes, so I've never been able to keep up with current fashions to begin with. I tend to go with classic, comfortable styles by default. Things that look good on pretty much everybody. I have a few outfits I've been able to find that are truly unique, but they're a reflection of my personal sense of style that has developed as I've grown into myself, not anything popular fashion has influenced. <br>  <br>  I would suggest finding your own style. What things flatter your figure, play up your favorite attributes and/or make you feel pretty? You're an adult now, you don't need to worry as much about fitting in by wearing the popular clothes. Adults aren't the same type of cruelly crittical as teenagers in that department. But still, If you like the popular fashions, go to a department store and ask one of the sales staff what's popular. An experienced employee will know this stuff and they get paid to help you.
B3guO2ZRaa	Almost all guys don't want sex everyday multiple times a day. And if they do, they will probably change in a month or so, and alter back and forth. I know I go through periods of wanting sex badly and not wanting it so much.<br>  <br>  Guys just get tired of the same thing after a while. Although, you are quite beautiful if I do say so myself.<br>  I say, go ahead and dress up for him.|`|bxIB7pojaa	I don't know what's wrong with him, but part of the problem is he is young and he will regret it later. You are a beautiful young woman and the suggestions from the other girls sound good to me. My wife and I have been together for several years and we still great sex frequently. She dresses sophisticated, but very sexy!<br>  He also may have something else on his mind, or may be stressed about something. <br>  I hope it gets better for you. Don't be to hard on yourself! You are a very sexy young woman!|`|7QF1yzN2aa	If you guys like alone.<br>  Just be in a bra and underwear.<br>  You'll be comfy and he'll love it.<br>  <br>  And mabye a halter and short shorts?<br>  Or mini skirt.<br>  <br>  ALWAYS in red or baby blue.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your skinny, so a top that shows your stomach, and short shorts would look attractive to him.|`|XeXtCyhIaa	tell him to grow the **** up and quit acting like a child.  he should be ******* happy you married him and that he can have sex with his wife and not some disease ridden whore from a community college.|`|0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	He's a twit for not wanting to make love to you, regardless of what you're wearing.  Maybe he can't get it up unless you feed his fantasies - which means he's not very mature as a man, and has bought into the stereotype of Playboy.  However, that being said, don't be too concerned about this, he's not asking you to get kinky.  I'd just go along with him as long as he keeps his wardrobe requests simple.  (I think an oversized T-shirt with bare legs while cleaning is sexy also.)|`|VXQFT341aa	I'm sorry after seeing your pic I forgot the question.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	Awe, you're so cute... just wear heels, with short skirts and little lacey belly tops.

ZfXeR519aa	Cut, grow out, or put on extensions so that your hair falls a bit past your collar bone. <br>  Put in some bangs, long enough to be just below your eyes. <br>  Sweep your bangs to the side. <br>  Bleach your hair, carefully following the directions on the package. Try to get your hair a soft yellow color. To get the golden/orange tones out of hair a white toner may need to be used. <br>  Part your hair into sections, a bottom layer , a top layer (where most of the hair should be), the top of the bangs, and the tips and bottom of the bangs. <br>  Fold a piece of foil on the tips and bottom layer of your bangs, they will be yellow. <br>  Put your choice of orange dye on the top layer and on your bangs(see below.)Be very careful not to get it on the bottom layer, the bottom will be white. <br>  Mix it in just enough to saturate your hair with the dye. <br>  Swirl it around (just leave the bangs)on the top and put the shower cap over it. <br>  Leave it in as long as the directions say to. <br>  Put a bag(produce bags work well)on the bleached part and a small bag (cut the other in half) around the bang bottom and tips-still foiled- and tie a rubber band very very tight around it to keep it from getting colored.|`|81Ru1OL6aa	yes|`|u18GBKmiaa	take a picture of her to the hairdressers they will then cut it like that but to suit you|`|aIjOfkM8aa	Just show the hairdresser a picture of Hayley Williams and say you want your hair like that.|`|3G7Lpah5aa	yess|`|LWsyxuMfaa	yess|`|fNgv2FeRaa	clone|`|tWxcBW0saa	go to your hair dresser and take along a pic of hayley williams <br>  and ask for your hair to be cut like hers<br>   <br>   but it needs to be the same length first =)<br>  <br>  when its cut like it i recomennd bead head products for styling like the shine junkie product <br>  also Toni and guy straghtenign spray is reallly good<br>  <br>  =) good luck with that<br>  <br>  al xx|`|5OxJsYznaa	that's soo awesome..her hair's manic!<br>  You could even get it dyed that vibrant red.

w4Ci2GqYaa	Yea I can't take credit for this answer but Avocado mixed with olive oil and egg yolk really do make a HUGE difference. Just mash up the avocado (Make sure it's super ripe) and then blend in olive oil and egg yolks.<br>  Also, for a regular conditioner, try Redken extreme Rescue Force. It's a deep conditioner and it repairs hair and it worked wonders! :)<br>  Good luck.<br>  Also, the best and only way to completely get fix damaged hair is to cut it all off. ALL off. And make sure to eat a high protein and healthy diet for nicer hair! :)<br>  Good luck! :D|`|opD5iYLEaa	Use head and shoulders moisturizer. You can cut your hair and restyle it again.

Mayo works. It sounds gross but if you mix mayo (3 tablespoons) with one egg, it deep conditions your hair. Leave it one for at least 2 hours, then shampoo. Also, use olive oil and a plastic shampoo cap to keep the heat in, for another 2 hours a week. In about a month, you will notice a big difference.

I4RhWK5Eaa	you can take biotin, massage your scalp for 5 minutes before you get into the shower (it causes oil production so it makes your hair gross), and eat lots of veggies and water, that ovation - <a href="http://ovationhair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ovationhair.com/</a> - cell therapy is supposed to help. wild hair growth oil smells like sheet so mix it with some other products to calm down the scent. i do some herbal essences leave in conditioner, anti frizz stuff from john frieda and several other hair products i find in my mom's drawers that sound good for my hair. (lol) if you can stand the smell, good for you, but i can't. it helps your hair a lot though. prenatal pills are good for hair growth too. cut off any split ends that you find too to keep your hair healthy. use either garnier fructis length and strength shampoo and conditioner or beautiful lengths shampoo conditioner by pantene to stop breakage. air dry your hair, don't straighten it, don't heat curl it or anything along those lines. i let mine be on weekends or pull it back wet and then sleep on it and in the morning i take it out so i get lots of volume and don't have to use products and a blow dryer to get good hair. use a scrunchy though instead of a regular hair band though or else you'll get this weird dent thing in your hair. thats pretty much everything i've found that actually works and helps.|`|Dm8s3bBLaa	There are products you can get to make your hair grow, but there are other things you can do too.  You should take a vitamin that will help stimulate hair and nail growth.  Also, you should use products that help protect long hair.  Get your hair trimmed regularly to keep the ends healthy.  Have patience.. I'm growing out my hair, too, so I feel your pain!|`|YHcOS0Sfaa	take good care of it. wash it every other day because its not that good to wash it daily, or to wash it for a while. if you don't wash it in a long time it gets smelly and when it loooks greasy it looks yucky.|`|Ls6qQgcaaa	well every now and then u have to get your dead ends cut off|`|1Y073bjiaa	There is yes, but it wont improve it much.<br>  1.

Be sure to wash your hair, not everyday, about every 2 days. <br>  5.

OHfZFR31aa	You need to have firm, toned skin with no flab or cellulite, as well as a gorgeous photogenic face<br>  <br>  You also need to have a proportionate body type, meaning your bust and hips need to be the same measurement, or within an inch of each other, and your waist needs to be 10-12 inches smaller than your hips. If your bust is more than an inch smaller than your hips, or vice versa, you don't have model proportions. If you are thick around the middle, then you don't have model proportions|`|ydHU7gYIaa	your size isnt all you need to get work or be considered plus. how tall are you? plus size girls have to be 5'9 to get work, and being taller than that is usually what gets you jobs over the 5'9 girls. you will probably be asked to lose a little weight also if you do get booked. plus sizes range from 8-10 and sometimes, if a girl is really tall and stunning, a 12 is accepted. 14 is a little too large a size, even though in the real world, it does not make you "fat" by any means. your face is really the money also; if you dont have a strong face, you will be passed over. modeling is brutal, and being a plus size makes it 50 times more so. competitions arent how people get into modeling; you go to agencies (almost always in big cities), and submit quality photos of yourself to every one until someone calls you to come in and walk for them, or to have them shoot some photos of you. shows like top model arent realistic and the girls that win arent really chosen because they will make a lot of money modeling; its their other traits that get them the title. im sorry to sound harsh or discriminating, but trust me, modeling agents are so sooo much harsher and they will not let you down easy. if you feel you have what it takes, you must be very very strong to stand up to these insults. im considered plus size, and am only a size 8 (and 5ft, 10 in), and i got VERY lucky to get booked by the first agency i contacted in chicago now, but work is much harder to get than size 2 models.|`|csytAtyPaa	you just have to big big and cute

But ususally when paired with red lips eyeliner should be light and barely noticeable. You just want your eyes to pop a little bit. You could even skip it depending on what you think looks good at the time.<br>  Stay away from shiny, shimmery makeup...it honestly looks horrible in pictures--and at prom you take lots of pictures.<br>  Have fun!|`|gxczXgvXaa	Red lips.

tfsImr9oaa	that hair style is not as much about the shape of the face but the facial features ..for instince bangs split up the face there for there not ment for people with a big nose or features you would like to distract from the lower part of your face. Curls on the other hand are a distractor which means ANYONE can pull off big curls. As for the shape of the face anyone with a rectangle heart oval square circle triangle kidney bean octagon..well you get what i mean..shape face would pull that off really well the longer the hair the more it thins out the face though so just keep that in mind.|`|AnSFRCnraa	Probably any shape you just named.And to do it I would think separate it into six sections and curl each section with a curling iron then use hair spray for control,and if you have bangs flat iron over those like the picture.But if your still needing help,I would take the picture to a salon and get it done and ask the stylist how you can keep the hair style up and how you can do it at home.Hope this helps.|`|df5d6b95610591f3c69fe8ce441de389aa	oval, diamond, heart, NOT SQUARE OR ROUND.

taboL1hbaa	If you're hair is dry, I'd recommend getting a deep conditioner. You can get them at salons and some grocery stores. If you don't want to buy one, you can put mayo all over your hair (don't worry, the scent comes out), but I prefer deep conditioners. You have the right idea washing it every other day because that helps it so it doesn't dry out as much. Try not to use many heat products on your hair because that really dries it out. You may also want to get a leave-in conditioner because it helps moisturize your hair too. But DON'T use a leave-in conditioner if you have fine hair because it'll weigh it down and make it feel all gooey. I like Biosilk Silk Therapy and Matrix Biolage Leave-in Conditioner. For your frizz problem, try getting a no-frizz shampoo like Herbal Essences None of Your Frizzness. I'd also recommend getting a shampoo that says 'hydrating' or 'moisturizing' on it. Hope I helped! :)|`|Vdutn1GYaa	your problem is the fact that you wash it everyday. Your hair creates natural oils that keep it from being dry. but you can try Herbal Essence Hydralicious or Matrix Biolage.

If all else fails, Gift card, Gift Card, Gift Card.|`|9DuXGXOYaa	Well why dont you ask her what she wants<br>  <br>  It depends on what sort of girl she is.

NNVatdAMaa	well i honestly have never done it myself, but i've heard that egg whites can keep your hair stiff when doing such extreme styles as many commercial styling products can't hold.<br>  back in the punk era, many punks used school glue (the clear kind i imagine !)<br>  if you live in america there's this thing called Knox brand gelatin that gives incredible hold for such styles, but you have to get the consistency just right.<br>  and don't forget, a tough, strong hold hairspray is essential to keep it unmovable ! <br>  hope i've helped :)|`|KhxIyJOcaa	strong hair spray!!!<br>  like one that says super hold or what ever.<br>  when you section your hair off to do each spike.<br>  soak the hair with the hairspray (section at a timeeee!)<br>  and use a hair dryer to dry it and it stays up in place! <br>  add a little hair glue to the tips to make them hard if you want :)<br>  xo

Go for it. This is a cute haircut. Just make sure they use a razor. It gives it a cool edge.....|`|l74RoxUDaa	It's hard to judge from the picture just what a loss this would be, since I cannot see how her present hair frames the body.  We can only see some of it.  What I can see is just beginning to look nice and would just be uglified by these styles.<br>  <br>  Hairdressers will tell her to go for it, because they make more money that way.<br>  <br>  Nice colour.  Pity about the paranoia.|`|hQn84sigaa	Yush, definitely. I think it would look awesome. She has pretty eyes, btw. ;D|`|NNVatdAMaa	yeah i think that she'd suit short hair :)<br>  she'd deffinitely suit a fringe too !|`|jOLdvbdbaa	Why is there a stop sign on her face?
fbKVq6Znaa	china or mexico<br>  but i wanna know. WHY do you want a replica designer bag?<br>  i'd appreciate an answer in return. thanks<br>  <br>  why dont you just buy a nice leather handbag? ive seen loads in your price range. sorry just trying to help out. i just feel bad when i see people with obvious knock offs because it just comes off as tacky when youre sticking an enlarged terribly stitched LV logo in someones face. its sad because its embarassment without you even knowing it. im sorry i would help you find one but 1) the worst knockoffs are sold online (not that there are any 'good' looking ones) and 2) its just against my fashion-philosphy|`|mI95IbBUaa	try lj-fashionhouse.com<br>  <br>  The price and quality from that site are amazing. Good Luck!|`|Whr8GPPJaa	I wouldn't recommend buying a fake one online, you don't want to give your credit card info to someone who sales knock off bags. My suggestion is go to New York and purchase one with cash, their pretty cheap...around $50 bucks and if you can't go there, see if any on your friends or co-workers know of a local person who sales them.|`|iyPz8ZKYaa	My friend gave me one just today ; really weird . -_o|`|UuRiBmbAaa	try ebay|`|4255760f761afe3e40ddebaaeca4d981aa	ebay has good deals|`|nqAMX323aa	you can try www.good-handbag.com<br>  Not long ago I bought this site, personally think that the quality is better, prices are also very reasonable|`|LZ5JLq1oaa	I buy handbags from china.

Theres never anything to say, so i make it short but fun. <br>  <br>  What the other girls have is confidence.<br>  They have the confidence that when they tell a story, the listeners will laugh or be interested.<br>  <br>  I also noticed that girls are kinda fake when around guys.<br>  Their like "CAMMYKINZ. HAHAHHAH, your soo funny"<br>  and really gay stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Just get close with your girls. Act like a friend, but fun.<br>  Once people see you having fun with the girls, the guys will follow next. and if their thinking that your part of the girls group, they'll have fun with you too.|`|l0b4KLD9aa	Pretend just your friends are there.
