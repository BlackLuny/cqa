20090219205827AAywc2v	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do you choose the best hair salon? Should I make some phone calls?	Should I make a few phone calls around town and make sure they know what the hell I am talking about?      I've been to sooo MANY hair salon's and always walked out very unhappy. Every time I show them a certain cut and color, they never do anything even close to it. For about 3 years, I've wanted a certain cut and color...HOW do I pick the right salon?       When I call random places nearby...WHAT do I say to them? I don't want to tell them straight up what I want. I'm afraid they are going to tell me they can't do it once I get there. Saying "yes we can do that" can either mean, they can, or they just said that for more clients. Are there any questions I can ask that will give me a clue that they are a GOOD hair salon?    Obviously, "how long have you been in the business" ...but what else?   is this a good idea, to call around???

Aren't there enough attractive designer frames to keep glasses on the fashion victim? Personally, I started with contacts and switched for the convenience. Now I believe I look better with glasses with my wide cheekbones. That has to be true for other people (maybe those with smaller eyes).       So, isn't this treatment a little out-dated since Dorothy Parker's snarky "men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses"? What's your opinion? Are eyeglasses still ugly?

OK! so im getting the ipod touch next week as you may know because i already asked this question except this time im going to put it in style and beauty even though it has nothing to do with it except the ipod touch is beautiful lol and im going to re-phrase my questions.       1. i have an apple from school therfore i cant download anything except music onto it from friends21.com so i cant download a movie converter thing because it doesnt open and i really dont want to jailbreak my ipod (well i do, its just that everyone i know screws it up and i dont want that to happen to me)   so how can i get full length movies onto my ipod touch without going on the internet on my itouch and watching it there i mean like having them in my videos. so basically, is there a website that i can download  full length movies that are already .mp4 (preferably free) i know thats asking alot but hey you never know.       2. for getting applications onto the itouch do i still have to have an apple account even though the application is free? because i might only get an itunes gift card like a month after i get my itouch so i want applications before that. so even if they are free do i still have to put the itunes card # in and all that?          THANK YOU SO EFFIN MUCH (only if you helped tho otherwise go **** a person who cares)

But, it seems the same to me?so does anybody know any other homemade scrub, maybe like oatmeal and sugar together?would that work?thankx:)            some tips i tried:   *use vaseline lip therapy(99 cents at walmart!), put it on then rub your lips lightly with a toothbrush,LIGHTLY, do it every night or every other night. Also leave vaseline overnight and you'll wake up with moisturized lips      *for those of you that's planning to put eggs on your hair(the whole egg), DONT DO IT. maybe the egg yolk would work but i didn't try it yet;).      *for soft and lighter skin, mix egg white with lemon, (i put the same amount), then mix with a fork until it gets bubbly or until the egg white is completely mixed with the lemon. Apply on face. Then wash after 10-15 minutes, or more if you want. Wash out with cold water to close the pores. do this 2-3 times a week, don't do it 2 much cause if you do, it will have less effect each time.      *don't wash your hair every single day, it will take out vitamins or important oils from your hair. At least shower every other day, you could do it 2 times a week but i do it every other day.      *hair products:Silk Drops Hair Serum, and Tresemme Heat Tamer or V05 Heat Protection (both for heat protection, V05 is cheaper, but i use tresemme now), Suave or Tresemme Hairspray.      alright, good luck and please answer thee question:)

I've used tons of spray ons and lotions, and they ALL eventually turn me orange and blotchy.  So I'm reverting back to the good ole tanning beds.  But I know nothing about what beds are good or not.        I saw a deal for $20 a month, bronze bed, all you want.  Is that good?  Or is the bronze bed only for base tans.  If I went every day good I get a really good tan using just a bronze bed?       What packages should I be looking for, and at what cost?      I don't mind having to commit to a yearlong stay at a certain tanning place. I just want a good tan, for the cheapest price possible.      ~Ingrid

20090219212901AAjeO3V	Beauty & Style;Hair	What should i do about my damaged hair ?	All my life I've had Long blond hair.  Well, I kinda got tired of it so I decided to go dark, but it went a little too dark.  To make a long story short, It turned out Jet black.  Well, little did I know - It doesn't come out of blond hair ( I have no common sense. ) Well, I called a hair salon and the lady said "Yes, we can fix it - it will be a little more blond than usual but it WILL be fixed." So, I went there and by the time I left, she had bleached it four times WITHOUT stripping the color out.  When she was done bleaching it, she couldn't comb it without getting chunks of hair.  My hair was metallic orange, brittle, and like straw.  Split ends everywhere ! I was so upset, I was crying.  They had to cut it very short.  This was 4 days before I started high school, it entirely ruined by freshman year because I did get a lottt of attention and that is what boosted my self esteem.  I have no self esteem now, and I cry myself to sleep at least 4 times a week.  I've been doing deep conditioning treatments and this happened at the end of August.  It is now the middle of February and It is STILL damaged.  I can't straighten my hair and I do Mayonnaise, Eggs, Chi Products, Ion, etc.  Pretty much everything.  I do them 3 times a week.  Does anyone know what I can do to help it ? I want it normal by the time I go to the beach in the summer and I'm going at the end of June.  Any Advice from experiences or any professionals ? PLEASE HELP ! Sorry so long.

The guy who pierced it told me to clean it with Dial Anitbacterial Soap. Does it matter if it is liquid or bar? I bought the Walgreens brand of liquid antibacterial soap. is that ok? Also, I have First Aid Antiseptic Spray. Can I use that too?      How do I properly clean it? All advice is greatly apprieciated.      Also, I don't know how this is relevant, but after I got the piercing, I stood up to go look at it in the mirror, and my friend went with me, so she gave me my coat so I could put it on, and I passed out. Could this have been an adrenaline rush of some sort? I argued with my parents before hand when I told them i was getting it done and they yelled at me, like usual. Anger maybe, or that fact that I waited so long to get it done?       Anyways, All advice is Greatly apprieciated. Thanks in Advance.

20080209075435AAmGnWU	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Need help with the markings on my gold bracelet!!?	It isn't marked with 10k, 14k etc., It has 417 on one side which I learned is the European mark for 10k gold.  On the other side it says GS HR. Does this mean it's gold shell?  like plated or something? I was told it was solid gold not filled or plated at the store but would it have the 417 marking for 10k gold on there at all if it's just gold shell? Does most gold jewelry that's plated or whatever have a mark showing the kind of gold used(10,12,14k)   as well as a mark showing it's plated or filled? I am so confused.

I've had a few random, clean up split end trims since my last major cut. I'm starting to get super antsy with all this long hair now though. I have 12 inches to get cut at this point, but probably about half an inch in damaged hair is going to need to come off as of now.  Should I get it trimmed now and wait til May-ish to do the actual cut or just donate what I have now and get it over with.       My real concerns are 1)if I get it cut now and there's all that unhealthy stuff, they won't be able to use what has taken me sooo long to its full potential, and 2) If they still can use it maybe it won't be enough after I get rid of the splits...   ... Or maybe I really am kinda scared now to cut it.    Now that you've read my long hair freak out spiel... gimme some opinions!

20090219192052AA6iROq	Beauty & Style;Hair	I got a bad hair cut with too many layers that left my hair flat, got a perm and now it's even worse?	So, I'm eastern european. I'm very white with very DARK, thick hair that's very shiny and slick, but yet still verrryy prone to frizz.      I had beautiful, one length hair that I just through in a ponytail and woere it with the crease from it when i let it loose. Then, I got reallllyy bad hair cut that gave me extremely short layers, way to much texturizing and frizz galore. Not only that, but she hardly left me any hair on the bottom layers. The top of my hair would poof out, and the bottom would just lay there all stringy and gross... so ... I got a spiral perm on the bottom layers to give them some volume. It's been a love/ hate relationship. My curls are much smaller than I wanted them to be, but I cant seem to get the frizz away. I tried just towel drying, diffuser, allll types of products, braiding.... nothing works. It always ends up looking like a smooth helmet on top with a big frizzy mess on the bottom. I was thinking maybe coconut oil would help? What do you suggest? I would like to have frizz free, slightly wavy hair.

I'm 15 now, I used to do them by myself by plucking but I am now noticing that they are a little different in shape.  (My eyebrows in shape are similar to number 6 but in thickness, somewhat along the lines of number 1.)  http://www.g36.net/ocdesigns/eyebrows/ey...    I am planning on getting them done at a nail salon and was wondering if you need to tell them how you want them done or if they do what they feel is best for your face and features, also about how long will this process take?

20081118123003AAG9AlX	Beauty & Style;Hair	Which hair color and length suits me best? (Pictures included)?	So over the last 6 months I changed my hair A LOT.   First, I had brown ish hair with highlights and it was quite long, but thin, with a side fringe.   Then I got it cut by my friend, still the same color, but a bit over the shoulder length.   When it got split ends, I cut it just longer than chin level and also got it colored (using a 24-washes color) "chestnut" - dark brown/red color.   Here's the pictures, which one suits me best?   Remember, I'm 15 and I got older and my face changed a bit too, so I look different anyway.      Good hair day with long hair (it was wavy and shiny, it didn't always look like this):  http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...       On the left, after the pool so the hair was a bit wet:    http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...        http://photos-g.ll.facebook.com/photos-l...       On the left (now slightly shorter hair):    http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...       Cut and colored (2 months ago): Second from the right.   This was a formal event at the school as you can probably see...    http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...       With a fringe: (on the left):    http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...       And that's basically what it looks like now.   I had to cut it anyway, because of split ends, but I was just wondering. What do you think looks the best? Because the wash out color isn't really washing out completely, meaning it's growing out and it looks meh. So I was thinking of going dark chocolate brown? Or I could get highlights again but I don't really like having highlights that much. They get annoying. Anyway, and what cut suits me best? Also, with my face shape and whatnot, what do you think would look even better than any of these? Thanks in addvance! :)

20090219193156AAnHQBJ	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Creative/helpful ideas that will get my friend noticed?	She wants to be a model, badly, and I think she had what it takes. And she tried out for a modeling agency and they accepted her, 'cept they ended up either being a scam or something idk but they didn't do anything at all, so she quit the agency and got out of the contract, they were sucking all her money without doing diddly.      Anyway, what are some creative ways for her to get noticed?      My first idea was to sneak her picture (with a note) into a victoria secret shop on the counter or where an employee will see it...but It probbaly won't work, but it was a creative idea.      I also want to know, if we should make her a facebook/myspace/youtube for her modeling purposes too?      And if so, what should we put on it?      Ya, Im basically kinda like her manager/agent sorta, thats why I'm asking this x)      She wants to try out victoria secret, but any other good non-scam modeling places are fine, we just need to get her NOTICED.       This picture was just for fun, but I think it's a pretty good pose : )    http://i380.photobucket.com/albums/oo243...

I'm not asking you if she can make it, because you guys don't know her. She has the determination for this, and the "equipment" so I think she'll do fine.      ~~Best answer that gives me useful information gets voted best answer~~

I have asked them if they would let me get a tattoo and they have said no, but I'm 18 now so I don't need their permission.
