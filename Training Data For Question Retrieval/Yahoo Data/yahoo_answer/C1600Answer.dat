PQVEwu7Taa	Never used it. But i can recommend a good tour for you according to my travel experience. That is Tours4fun.com. They provide worldwide tours all over the world. Last time when i travel to Paris i used its tour and left a memorable experience. If you are intertested, you can visit its website to learn more.   http://www.tours4fun.com/new-zealand-tou...|`|OOz5ox6aaa	Actually i don't know. but i hear they do vampire tours as well. ;p|`|paHjJrrdaa	Yes I loved it and I'm from here LOL!  I use the Greyline tours.  The walking tour is the best! Not only will you hear some very interesting stories about the city and it's haunted houses (and other buildings), it's also a great tour of the city it's self.  It helps you learn your way around.  So it's a win win!  I took all kinds of pictures on the tour and one of them had something "whispy" in it.  It was fun though!!! I highly recomend it!|`|fJwA4ngMaa	I have not been in many, many years and do not scare so easily.  But yes, they are fun for a laugh.      Now I have not been personally, but I have several friends that go to The Myrtles plantation just an hour or two outside NOLA, I believe in Francisville, La., and they say it is GREAT!     I dunno if you are truly trying to get spooked, but just for fun they are a hoot. Enjoy yourself.|`|0lKLO8cGaa	the haunted tours in new orleans are not like haunted houses, meaning there aren't people in costume hiding out to scare you. it is more a walking tour around the town to some historic sites which have infamous histories.     by far the best tour is given by a guy named Lord Chaz...he works for a company called Vampire Street Theatre. his tour is a ghost and vampire tour, very fun and interesting. i believe he also does cemetery tours as well,,,,    hope this helps!

6cf0275dfcf47b6a37124ae7cc800816aa	There are a few things that you can go and do within a few hours drive:    - Austin: they have the lake that you can picnic by; bats that come out in their thousands at dusk; Sixth St and Fifth St for bars/clubs; Capitol building; for light-hearted fun do the Duck tour:    http://www.austinducks.com/    - San Antonio: visit the Alamo, the River-walk (shops, bars, restaurants etc. all under-ground, very 'cool'); tubing down the river (in the Summer!); near to the Hill country    South Padre island - longer drive but fun place for w/e    New Orleans - you could prob. drive it in about 6-7 hours. Tons of stuff to do there - tram ride, horse carriage ride, French quarter, Jazz, Mardi-gras, Cafe du Monde...great coffee and donuts!     Galveston?    Hope that helps a little? :)
AkGbYsU7aa	My dad says no :P  But as a 13 yr old, growing up in New Orleans all my life, I have gone from tour to tour & I would say nothings impossible in New Orleans.   But, if the answer you are looking for is no, then congrats.  But, if you really want some ghostly action, try Myrtles plantation!! And try sleeping there...It's a really knock-your-socks-off experience!!|`|Jh4Joth8aa	More than likely. The majority of the places in New Orleans are haunted.|`|WjCOiqFraa	no|`|kHhlwPXCaa	I would say no. My husband and I have stayed at this hotel and we believe it's one of the most beautiful places to stay in New Orleans.  If you drink enough strange things could happen though. lol

AleT38EYaa	Near UK's campus there are plenty of bars that are frequented by the students.  Even in the downtown area you could work at some places (McCarthy's, Cheapside, etc) and make good tips from the students there.      It depends on how nice of an apartment you want.  Most places around campus are relatively safe.  I paid $375 (all utilities included) for a furnished efficiency my senior year, but as a "grownup" would probably upgrade to something a little more expensive (a friend lives in a place about 3 miles from campus that's $600/month, everything included).      Go too far from campus and you'll get stuck in Lexington traffic (which is a nightmare), plus you'll be paying more and getting less in return.|`|46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	I guess it depends on your definition of nice.  The last apartment I had before I bought a home was a 841 sq. ft. 1 bedroom with a den at Spring House (rents now for $599).  I like the south side of Lexington best from Harrodsburg to Tates Creek.  But you location might be more suited to being near where you work.  Sorry I can't offer any details on bartending.  But here is a good starting point for apartment hunting (you can pick up hard copies at most grocery stores and other places with community papers/flyers): http://www.lexingtonapartmentguide.com/
234ca7b6cbff2e880a6f99318c18945daa	it's a associated free state.|`|jXyLlZd1aa	Yes it is|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Yes it is.. You don't need a passport to come or go to the usa if your puerto rican citizen|`|NAbioaNmaa	YES for over 100 years|`|QrSFskUpaa	yes|`|bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	Yes we are. In 1898 After the Spanish-American war, which Spain lost  Puerto Rico, Florida (which it was bought to Spain), Cuba, Dominican Republic and the Philippines became to be territories occupied by the USA. After a while USA gave their independence to all this countries, but to Puerto Rico. Since then the president used to name a governor, for Puerto Rico, first they were generals of the USA Army, later civilians and politicians. The first Puerto Rican governor, but named by the USA president, was Jesus T. Pi?eiro, after that 1950 we voted our very first governor, a historic event because it was the first governor elected by the people of Puerto Rico, in the Spain era governors were named by the king of Spain. Our first governor elected by the Puerto Rican voting us was Luis Mu?oz Marn and after that with the support of the USA Senate the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico got born, with it's own constitution and its own government, which is divided in 3 branches, the executive with 1 governor, the legislative with a Senate divided in 2 chambers and the Justice Department. At the beginning the Senate signed the Foracker Law Act creating the Puerto Rican citizenship after that the USA Senate signed the Jones Law act where the American citizenship was given to all Puerto Ricans, that's the reason every Puerto Rican that got born here is also an American citizen as if he/she got born in New York. Puerto Rico has a representative in the USA Senate, but without voting, he/she can suggest things for the island, but these suggestions need the approval of the Senate. We can't vote for the president, if live here in the island, but they come to collect money for their campaigns, anyways, and as all politicians, to make promises they won't keep.    To make something clear, we are a country since we are people united by language, traditions and folklore. We have our own identity and our own distinctions, we have everything to be a country because we are a country, you can be an incorporated territory, but we are also a country, a nation.|`|v62MVbHHaa	yes, but it is only a territory.|`|IngripgMaa	Yes!|`|CEAZWiU6aa	It is a U.S territory that has no representation in the House or Senate.|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	yes|`|lBZkXzr0aa	Its a commonwealth of the United States.|`|t0c9sfEkaa	well its a commenwealth an dpeople from america can go there without pas ports an dthey can come here without passports so yes|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Technically no.  * PR is an organized and non incorpored territory of the USA.  * According to the US Supreme Court, territories belongs to USA, but are not part of USA.    Similar to your head(state) is part of you(USA); but your hat(PR) is not part of you, just you owns it.    Curious, a nation who started as 13 colonies of another country has now colonies of their own (sorry, wrong term "territories" not "colonies").|`|QepcG34Vaa	No, it is a free asociated state, it doesnt belong its free and its's associated with the usa.

fJwA4ngMaa	The French Quarter has many old and beautiful hotels.  Most of them are incredibly nice and safe and with a little research you can be sure of their safety.  If you are truly concerned pick a hotel just outside the Quarter such as The Whitney or The Ritz or one in the Garden District both of which are walking distance or at least a short cab ride to the Quarter.      Unfortunately the murder they are speaking of did take place in the Quarter. Mr. NOLA guy, I hate it as much as you do, and we may not think of it as The Quarter, but this is still considered a part of it by a lot of folks.  Generally this area closer to Rampart and Esplanade can be considered a little more "rough" than parts of the Quarter closer to the river, but I go to bars in this area frequently and have never had a problem, EVER.   Not to mention this was a freak incident.  This sent shock waves through the city, and it was a tragedy that no one expected. And trust me, the security in this area has been beefed up like crazy in just the 2 weeks since.  And I do not expect that to change any time soon.      Bottom line is, this is a city like any other.  The more downtown areas have more people, hence there is more crime.  Just be careful.  Stick to well lit streets where there are other groups of people. Just be smart about it.     NOLA guy is right about St. Ann area having more gay bars, but this city is a melting pot of all kinds.  Everyone hangs around with everyone, everywhere, so it is not a big deal.    Hope this helps and enjoy yourself.|`|VxfyQZ2jaa	All of the FQ is good in that it is both safe and convenient.  The main problem people may encounter is noise from the street if they choose a balcony room.     The area around the intersection of Bourbon & Sant Ann Streets has some decidedly gay bars, but there is no where in New Orleans like the Castro District in San Francisco where straights are unwelcome.     Madison B is wrong and there have NOT been "murders" in the French Quarter. There was an awful tragedy recently where three teenagers murdered a FQ resident, but the parents of the three perpetrators turned them in to the police the next day. It was a horrible event that happened in an area (the FQ) where violent crime is very rare.     Hope you have a great time!|`|AkGbYsU7aa	Always expect bad parts,   lately there has been murders there....  so just be aware of your surroundings and you should be fine.|`|j1jeDi6Aaa	The only problem with the good parts vs. bad parts is that sometimes they are very close. Pretty much all the touristy areas are fine, esp. the French Quarter. Beware straying too far toward N. Rampart and/or Esplanade at night though; things tend to get more dangerous as you navigate away from the crowded areas. The best solution is not to wander off alone at night, looking obviously like tourists.
2cc75788c0a85d7434cad7a54afd37ecaa	If you're out on the RiverWalk you are going to freeze your little Coco's off, so you might want to go into the Ren Cen and head up the elevator to the observation deck. On a clear day you can see to Ohio.    If you really feel the need to taste the winter breeze, you should head out Jefferson Ave to Belle Isle. Car required.    Here is a link to a web cam out at the Dossin Great Lake Museum on Belle Isle:   http://www.detroithistorical.org/webcam/...    Remember that Detroit is north of Canada, ... little known (at least to outsiders) that is you fly due south from Detroit City Airport the first foreign country you fly over is Canada. Good sure bar bet.    While in town Coco, make sure you get a bite at one of our finer dining establishments: Lafayette Coney Island. Order a 2 on 1 and get a chocolate milk. Ask for the Milk trick. It is located within a few feet of Campus Martius, head out Michigan Ave. It is on your left.    Trust me. I haven't lied to you yet.    --  Edit: Are you in town for the show at Burt's? You should email me if you haven't been there.
94b8KImYaa	I've seen it take 6 months to a week to get a job. All depends on what they need when. Like Kevin L said, go ahead and apply and mention when you will be available.     I have been to 1 recruiter and did not like the fact, that I could have ended up with any cruise line.     So I opted out of that and went directly to the cruise line which I was interested in. And the good part was, that I did not have to pay in order to get a job there.     Good luck to you|`|0UVqBCNdaa	It just depends.  I sent my resume out in May and I was on the ship in July.    I could have been on the ship a lot sooner, but I wanted to give my current employer a full two weeks notice before I left.      I had several offers before that one, where I would get a call on a Thursday asking me if I could start that coming Monday.  So it took a little longer before they could find me something where I would have at least two weeks advance notice.    And I had turn down three or four offers before I finally was able to accept one.    What you can do, is tell them you are interested but you won't be available until such and such a date.  At least get the process started now.    I don't know what methods the others used to apply, but when I was applying my recruiter told me that what I could do if I wanted, was give my employer two weeks notice without having been assigned a ship.  And then go to Miami and get a hotel there for 2 or 3 weeks.  And she said within that time, you will almost certainly be assigned a ship, because you can meet the ship the next time it's in port (assuming in ports in South FL.  which a lot of them do, especially during the winter)|`|2po7CfwMaa	It can take months to a year.  Its not an easy process and they dont like to hire americans in general unless you have some cruise director or dancing skills.  The wait staff and housekeeping jobs are all non american, so really it depends on what kind of position your looking for.  Some years ago i worked in the casino Dept for NCL and they hired me on the spot because it was consigned out to another company to hire for that dept.  If your going for child care or massage or fitness 5hen you have a good chance at getting in.    I loved it!  No car needed, they feed you and clean your room, pay insurance..you get to travel and most of all you can save every dime you make!  Sure wish i didnt have kids now, or i would go back in a heartbeat!  There are docks in Miami on the pier at 1177 south america way that they hire direct from there too!  Depends on a lot of things.  Hope you get in . APPLY NOW AND DO NOT WAIT!|`|vA1zMzhKaa	I'm now working for my second cruise line, and both times it took several months. From the time I emailed my resume until they got back to me was about three months in both cases. From the time I was interviewed until I got onboard was another month, as they need things like police clearance and medicals done.    I know everyone says they won't hire Americans, but I've met plenty onboard!    Start applying now. If a job comes up before your lease expires, you don't have to take it. But if you wait you'll probably have to sign another lease!

It will help you make a decision from his unbiased descriptions about which is the better for your intended holiday.

tV7ZYIeEaa	No you would need to go south with the 417 then either catch the 408 or Beachline (528) and go west.     If you are going to take the turnpike to go south just take 417 all the way and catch the turnpike (91) near Disney    Can also just take I-4 West  and you will catch the Turnpike from there no tolls.  408 417 and 528 are toll roads    http://maps.google.com/maps?q=orlando&oe...
AA10640608	Pros: Inexpensive, great restaraunts, tons of cultural events, very diverse, friendly people    Cons: Heat & humidity about 6-7 months out of the year (some people like it), 4th largest city in the US with the traffic to prove it, too many illegal immigrants.

Houston is much less diverse than LA in my opinion.CA has about a quarter population in each race.  CA has many more illegal immigrants, whose grandparents are probably from LA like carlos mencia said lol.  LA is more liberal,atheistic, vegetarian,''green'' etc....  Houston is more conservative, theistic,meat lover, SUVs lovers ....imo.

24eKqnyqaa	Vasko Gligorijevi? has the Slavic Philhellenic Network website in Skopje and revealed FYROMs devious effort to steal and usurp the Greek identity of Macedonia. Some of his brilliant posts are the following.  http://www.americanchronicle.com/article...    As Vasko Gligorijevi? informed us, the state of FYROM forbids by law any scientific research on the national identity of the Slavomacedonians (we can all realize why). This law was published at FYROMs governmental newspaper on 15/3/1996, when Gligorov was president and it is still in effect (Slu?ben vesnik na RM 13/96 od 15 mart 1996 god.)    ?len 16    Odobrenieto mo?e da se dade za site oblasti opredeleni kako javen interes vo nau?no-istra?uva?kata dejnost, osven za nau?nite istra?uvanja vo oblasta na istoriskiot i kulturniot identitet na makedonskiot narod i nacionalnostite koi ?iveat vo Republika Makedonija, odbranata i bezbednosta.    Article 16    Approval can be given to all areas of scientific research that are issued for public interest with the EXCEPTION of the scientific research on the area of historical and cultural identity of the Macedonian people and the ethnicities that live in the Republic of Macedonia , defence and security.|`|gXU8Npwqaa	The Curious case of Vasko Gligorijevic    It has been a few days since the night of 28th January 2009 where concordantly to his own testimony, the FYROM police came into Vasil Gligorovs aka Vasko Gligorijevic apartment in Skopje and arrested him purposedly because of his activist actions. While watching the aftermath of Vaskos apparent arrest, i couldn't help from noticing how his own countrymen reacted to his plea for help. Normally someone would be deeply concerned for the physical safety of an individual calling desperately for help. In our case we had the exact opposite. The entirety of users coming from the state of FYROM displayed a powerful vested interest in demeaning and demonising him. In fact a few of them showed to harbor a feeling of intense hatred both for him personally and what he stands for.    This certainly reveals the general mentality which prevails nowadays in FYROM, over their own countrymen that happen to think differently. Especially those, not necessarily buying the widely-imposed propaganda and decide not to stay silent. It seems also a safe conclusion that FYROMs state has already taught its followers to discredit all the possible alternative sources of thought. Like Vaskos case, not only they are being demonised but also discredited and casted as "enemies/traitors" of their country. This unhealthy tendency is familiar in such regimes. They say if you cannot attack the claim, attack the arguer instead. This dogma has found nowadays its safe shelter in FYROM where aggressiveness and demonisation of the opponent seems to be the safest way of protecting core identity myths from any open discussion that might challenge them. Usually a claim should be treated on its merit and should stand or fall solely by its own quality. In our case its entirely the opposite. Anything someone said against the widely imposed dogma  even statements of established fact would be dismissed or ignored simply by attacking the source. Likewise Vasko has been portrayed as a paid agent, a liar, someone who doesntexist, a sick person and all those petty types of abuses to discredit the so-called "enemy". I am certain this campaign of demonising the "enemy" will be culminated in the upcoming days as it usually happens.      If anyone like Vasko presents ideas or pieces of information that will dare to challenge the established dogmas, then according to his countrymen that person cannot be one of them. "Youre either with us or against us" seems to be the newest favourite motto in FYROM.    Most likely this individual is being percecuted because of his articles against the fascist nationalistic state of fyrom. Its not the first the state of FYROM resorts to such Stalinistic methods and certainly not the last.|`|YrLvk1Tnaa	Some copy to former Kolyo Dijamanto - DUI (BDI) had become Jackasses with Kolyo, Greeks with Vasko.|`|7lMaoTQvaa	he doesnt sound Greek thats for sure.|`|gV6kZeAraa	Freedom to Vasko Gligorijevic in Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.) ?

d5ec0db90372775006f3c771bed01617aa	It depends really on what you want from a holiday. Are you interested in a party-and drink-all-day holiday? Then you might be better off to places like Malia in Crete, or Ios. Crete is really big, and if you want to move around you must rent a car, a moped or quads.  If it is sun, warmth, spakling blue sea, wind (the Cyclades can be quite windy in the Summer), and a more relaxed athmosphere, then go to Paros or Naxos (Mikonos and Santorini are very pricey: 1 small beer in Santorini = 12 euro in 2008).  On the other hand if you are interested in a more cultural type of holiday there aren't as many archeologic sites to visit compared to, let's say, Crete or Santorini, or Athens and the surrounding area (ten days will not be even enough to start!...).  They all have an airport, and I am sure there are direct flights during the Summer (from Manchester not 100% sure, though).  All these islands organise mini-cruises to various other islands (leaving the port in the morning to come back in the evening). These mini-cruises might seem expensive, but often a meal is included, and usually when you get to the island there is bus transport and a guide, so I think is money well spent.   Here are just a couple of sites to wet your appetite.   Cyclades:  http://www.parosweb.com/paros-webcams/po...  http://www.prokopis.com/naxos-greece/ind...  http://www.mykonos-web.com/  Malia, Crete:  http://www.east-crete.com/malia.htm    As for booking a place to stay, I would look at local hotel/rooms webpages, and book with them instead of going through a Travel Agency. It might seem a bit risky, but I have never had any problems.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Usually, a television from the United Kingdom will not work in Switzerland since they have a different signal type. Whereas PAL I is used in England solely has Switzerland two signal types. PAL B/G is used in the German speaking cantons and SECAM L in the French speaking part of Switzerland.  The new television generation to include the Samsung LE32A455 have European multi-tuners installed which are able to receive all European TV signals.  You will just need a plug adapter for the standard European 2-pin round plug.

It has some good thrilling rides there, but you do have to pay for the admission, but its worth it if you want to have fun.  There is also the roller coaster in New York New York, you might want to check that out as well.      :]
FvAl3UgQaa	Valid today only:    http://www.aircanada.com/en/offers/air/d...    $79 one way - you couldn't drive it for that price!|`|utGddhnVaa	Why leave edmonton? Unless you like the rain and snow in the same day cause I think that happens more in Van.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	If your by yourself, Book ahead and fly it's cheap. then rent a car for several days. Call westjet and get a price.  You should be able to drive one way on 2 tanks of fuel, you do the math.|`|TRM8tJ7laa	Try this:    http://www.roadtripamerica.com/Fuel-Cost...|`|AA11341587	You can get a Westjet sale ticket for $135(after tax) one way.  The bus is about the same for a week in advance ticket.  I calculate gas for a one way trip between $100 and $130 - depending on the mileage you get in your car, I can only estimate at between 8 to 10 litres per 100 KM.  And estimate on how well you luck out at gas prices that could change tomorrow and will be a different price at each stop.    So, better depends on what you prefer or other details related to your trip.   If you include extra hotels on the way expecting it to be a two day trip driving, then that is more than a car rental after flying there.  You may also want to consider the extra restaurant stops for meals on the road.  And if driving is going to be tiring for you and if you are refreshed and alert to do your task when arriving in Edmonton.    Personally, the costs are comparable enough and I'd fly to save time and avoid driving in winter or spring weather.  Whereas a bus also avoids driving, it is still the same price as flying, yet more time than driving and not relaxing as it is hours and hours cramped in a bus.      The one consideration that would change my mind is if I needed to be more flexible.  Once you book a flight it's difficult and costly to change.  If you finish earlier or later than expected, it is easy to completely change to fit your plans if you drive.
Jm3vMKx3aa	It depends on your citizenship. If you are a Canadian citizen you may use your driver's license as picture ID and your original birth certificate as proof of citizenship at present.    Starting June 1st, 2009 you will need a passport or an enhanced driver's license which denotes the citizenship.    If you are a citizen of any other country you cannot enter the United States spontaneously.    Citizens of the 35 visa-waived countries need a prior travel authorization (ESTA) to be obtained from the website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.    Citizens of other countries need a visa which must be obtained from the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General of their home countries.

QUOojnOUaa	If you are 100% positive that this is how your 2 & 1/2 year old will act then I would tell you to definitely wait one more year.  Your 5 year old will have more fun if her sibling is happy and they can do more together.  WDW is a big place and can be very overwhelming to children (and adults as well).  Wait a year and see how your younger child is acting by then.  You may also want to try practicing waiting in line at home.  I now that sounds ridiculous, but we did that with our child when he was about three and 90% of the time he had no trouble waiting for his turn.|`|54tW840Oaa	I think you should wait a year so that way even though your daughter will have to wait a year the vacation will be more enjoyable and give you less stress. Would you rather go and have a screaming kid and a quiet daughter and a non relaxing vacation or postpone a year but have your son be better behaved and a relaxing fun family vacation.|`|PFXNGl1Uaa	disney offers a benefit called child swap.  This helps if you have small children and they can't ride.  They give you a return ticket for everyone in your party and you can avoid the line.  Another sugestion is to stay in the park so if the smaller child gets tired you can take the bus back to your hotel. Another option is to bring a babysitter.  Most small children are very fasinated with Disney.|`|pJFYp8Mtaa	Believe me, your 5-year-old will enjoy herself so much more when little brother is NOT suffering from two-itis. Wait one more year. She will still be princess perfect and he will look like a prince charming compared to his current self. He'll also have more stamina. Disney can be draining and it's so expensive that you won't want to miss anything.|`|BbfNMXtiaa	If you already know how your 2 year old is, and there isn't anything you can do about it, it sounds like you already know how it will be. You can either wait, and your 5 yr old can deal with it, or you can all suffer through the tantrums of your 2 year old through your whole vacation. I also have a 2 year old, so I sympathize, but I wouldn't do it if you know you would be miserable. Plus, if you wait, he will have a better time and so will everyone else.|`|rPbyDmjYaa	Honestly I would wait a year.  The 5 year old will still be into the princesses I am sure.  Then maybe the little one will be able to remember some of the trip.|`|0WASp0bHaa	She will still be into the princesses next year. See if there is a Disney on Ice coming to your town. Going next year when they are 3.5 and 6 is going to make a much better vacation for all. You are going to be spending a lot of money, having a little one throwing a fit all day is really not they way to have a vacation|`|53eb2e3a77a123176238e48eed353879aa	I know when we first went, my little sister was 4 1/2 and I was almost 9, my brother was almost 8. My mom didn't want to have to deal with diapers and tantrums and all that stuff. I go often now, though, and there are a lot of people with 2 year olds. You don't have to take him on all the rides...they have some playgrounds in certain parks and stores and stuff all over the place. If you go during good parts of the year, you won't have to wait all day on line. It depends if you think it would be worth it for your daughter, since your son won't remember it. But Disney is a ton of fun and I'm sure you will be able to find some ways to keep the 2 year old entertained.|`|zyUfLvF5aa	My parents took me to Disney World when I was one, the same thing with my little brother. I remember how my brother cried and screamed at some points, but we got through it. It all depends on how much you are understanding with your two year old. I would maybe go sometime in this next winter. The best time to go is in January (not MLKJr weekend) because the crowds are low. This will make the lines shorter, and your two year old will be a little older. Your daughter will be fine. Just try to make the vacation the best time for everyone.|`|UPSys1POaa	I'd say, wait. I was 8 when my parents took me, and my sister was 5. I will never forget that vacation, I will cherish those memories forever. Your daughter won't grow out of Disney for a while, so relax. :)|`|xSHRJw46aa	Normally I would say that WDW can be a magical place for little kids.  We took our kids when they were about 3 and 5.  Even if they don't remember it, all the magic can be very real to them.  However, it seems to me that you already know the answer to your question.  A big part of vacation is attitude, and you are already dreading the trip.  In the right frame of mind, Disney World is a wonderful place where you can see shows, ride rides, and become a kid again.  In the wrong frame of mind it is an expensive place full of junk food, expensive stores and endless lines.    You already know that the trip will be better if you wait another year.  Also, it is not exactly suffering to have to wait until age 6 for your first trip to see the Mouse.  I never went until I was grown and married.  Of all the things that a child experiences growing up, I don't think that my lack of early disney experience has scarred me the most.    Wait untill he grows out of it a bit.  They all do.  You will have a better attitude and everyone will have more fun.

VjPnHxZyaa	There are 3 Divi's in Aruba.  But the one connected to the Tam are right next to each other.  And yes you can share each others facilities and amenities.  The Alhambra Casino is within walking distance to the Tam/Divi, but the Casino and the Resort offer a Shuttle to and from the Casino.  So getting there is never a problem.  I would probably stay at the Divi as they refurbished their rooms not to long ago and they are right on the beach....hope this helps...enjoy!|`|JU4mzlq5aa	They are a 10 min. walk from one another.  A shuttle will take you to the casino every 5-10 min.  Just came back from Aruba. (3rd time in 4 yrs.) I prefer the Tamarijn, but you can't go wrong with either.  At the Tam. "every room is directly on the beach, although some area's are rocky. We stayed in the 2400 building.(again). awesome beach, not many people, calm water.  It is at the far end of the property.  ENJOY,|`|7tX1dX5waa	i dont think that they are that far from eachother...i would stay at divi because its newer and alot bigger
YvNCOYZZaa	Where?  What do you consider 'decent'?    A Motel 6 in the Midwest may only be $40, but a basic 'decent' room in NYC may be $300.    For me, decent is the Westin, Hilton, Sheraton, or Hyatt.  In major cities, rooms generally start at about $150 and go up from there.      When I traveled around by car this summer, I found that even in cowtowns, the smallest dumpiest rooms were still $80+ - mostly because of lack of supply and high demand.      Edit:  For Panama City, FL, head to orbitz, expedia, or kayak.  The prices there will range enormously based on when you plan on traveling and how close to the beach you want to stay.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	UK or US? UK - 100 (roughly 70 bucks)  US - Duno|`|FCCkrhozaa	Around $50    Panama City Beach Hotels http://hotels.americacheaphotels.com/Cit...|`|AA10827766	70 dollars|`|ygLjblp2aa	I live in Northern Va, DC area. $70-$80 will get you a Super 8, $100 will get you a Courtyard Marriot, Holiday Inn type of place. Nicer hotels are between $150 - $500 depending on quality, star rating, etc. I was recently looking for a nice place to spend my wedding night but not to break our budget & the lowest we could come up with was $150 - $200. But they're definitely more expensive around here.
fFnsJ7maaa	Most cost efficient is one of the new bus companies from Philadelphia to NYC. Try boltbus.com, megabus.com, gotobus.com, Lucky Star or the other Chinatown buses (not sure which ones do Philly). They'll only go from Philly to various places in Manhattan. Then the MTA (subway or bus) to Harlem. Much cheaper and faster than Greyhound.     Second is anywhere on SEPTA to Trenton, switch to NJTransit to NYC. Then MTA to Harlem.     Last is Amtrak, which has several stops in NJ. (I prefer the train, but it's more expensive.)|`|XzF5qSHfaa	I'd definitely take Amtrak from 30th street station to Penn Station in NY. It is not that cheap but either is parking in NY.  Your other option is to drive to Trenton and take the Metro Line. Cheaper but not as frequent of a schedule as Amtrak.|`|Mumfvpuzaa	bus (greyhound)  train (amtrak)      if you drive to trenton, princeton, etc, you can take the new jersey transit which takes you right into penn station and is rather inexpensive.

i6RHI18Paa	Jane,<br>  <br>  I've lived in Florida all my life. It is a wonderful place to visit. The summer proper, July/August, are typically very hot if your inland. Generally, Sunday through Thursday at the Disney parks and hotels always has the most available specials and or discounts. <br>  <br>  PRE-planning is key. I don't so much mean your itineraries per se, but also finding deals and best ways to get to what you enjoy. <br>  <br>  As well, coming from Colorado, Florida's tourism web sites can get you some good package discounts as well. For newlyweds, Florida tries to be at least a layover destination for honeymooners; so knowing, they can be very helpful in getting you not only specials, but also finding interesting things to do. <br>  <br>  Renting a car is probably best, and the cool thing is, you don't have to keep it for your entire stay. Some friends of mine from Tennessee come down every year, he plays a lot of golf and she just relaxes at spas and hits the Outlet Malls (They are older people and both High Schools teachers). They always get a special rental car rate, I think maybe a weekend special, if memory serves, or something like that.|`|cv2S4tsnaa	If you decide to go to Disney, be sure and check into staying at a resort on-site.  You get some great perks, like extra time in the parks, free transportation to any Disney location, and you can upgrade your ticket to include a dining option that can save you up to 30% on in park dining.  (It sure is nice and hassle free to pay for this all in advance!)  <br>  <br>  If you like the nightlife, you can always catch a cab from the resort, no biggie!  Be sure and sample the beers from around the world in Epcot.  That made for a pretty great day when my husband and I went last year.  We are 25/26.  Follow the sampling with one of Disney's best shows, Illuminations, and you have got yourself one swinging vacation!  Enjoy your time in Orlando, and if you decide on Disney, be sure to allow yourself enough time to explore all the parks!|`|xZK4dIHxaa	If you go to Disneyworld it might be better to stay at a disney resort<br>  Because the night scene around disney but outside the resort is pretty sad but downtown disney is very nice it has night clubs and nice resturants. You can stay at some nice resorts inside Disneyworld that have free shuttle service to just about anywhere. most of the resorts that are on the moderate to deluxe side are great for just adults and not like a kiddie farm I recommend the Coronado Springs resort or polynesian resort. I stayed at the Coronado springs resort and loved it. I also stayed an extra night at a hotel outside the resort one night<br>  on the main strip in the orlando area and it was a sad run down place.<br>  I suppose there are some nicer areas outside disney but I dont think its worth it and then you will need to rent a car. If you stay inside Disney<br>  shuttles will get you everywhere you want to go. If need be you can find car rentals inside disneyworld. Have fun !!!|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Lots of hotels offer free shuttles.  However, my opinion is that they are never very good, so just rent a car and drive yourself.  I wouldn't pick a hotel based on the shuttle.  Been there, done that.  If you don't want to rent a car, stay at a Disney hotel.<br>  <br>  Disney does have four parks to choose from.  Also there is Sea World and Universal (two parks) and several water park options.  Since it sounds like you are just starting to plan, I would go to Florida and Orlando's board of tourism websites and request their free info to help you get started - also it includes coupons!|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	Look at the Seralago hotel in Kissimmee they are located on Bronson Blvd right next to Old town. Old town has shopping, games, rides, and bars within walking distance. They provide free shuttle to Disney but use maingate if you want to go to Universal and Seaworld. You can also use them for transportation to and from the airport. What you want to consider before you rent a car if you really are going to need one. You will have to pay parking at the parks, all the tolls to and from the airport, the additional insurance on the car as well as any other little things that they charge you for. I personally find it cheaper or about the same amount of money using the shuttle services. You can also check out I ride trolley on International Dr. There are many hotels and some in provide transportation. There are also alot of museums and things to see on International Dr. Check out there web site.

lWtazRzZaa	Maybe someday interpreters won't be needed anymore, but I doubt it's gonna be some time soon. In public schools we have "communication" classes with native english speakers. But there is only one native speaker per school, so we only have those classes twice a month. There's probably a good amount that will be able to read english in our generation(this group is still above average though), but most people cant understand what native speakers are saying.<br>   I think it's a highly competitive job. There's not enough people who understands english to abolish the profession but there are enough who can speak both languages fluently for the job. So you have to study really hard. Studying is not the only way to learn japanese though. You need to use it in field, you need to put your self in circumstances where you HAVE to use japanese. I achieved japanese when I was young, so It wasn't difficult for me. But when my mom(she's japanese) learned english it took her 10 years or so to speak fluently, she still makes mistakes that even I can point out. <br>   Anyways I think you should actually live in Japan to learn the language. Languages are meant to be achieved by ear, not eye. Good luck. btw I'm 18.|`|AA10662056	>But my uncle squashed my dreams in reminding me that my generation is growing up having to take English and he thinks most everyone that might need an interpreter will probably just already know English.<br>  <br>  Do you mean your generation in Japan? No. Young generation is not so eager to learn English.<br>  <br>  But there is another reason why not many more interpreters are needed in Japan. That is, there are already many Japanese interpreters here.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	I disagree with your uncle.<br>  <br>  Learning a foreign language is NEVER a bad idea. By learning another language, you learn something about that culture.<br>  <br>  There are also people who haven't learned English and who will converse only in their native tongue. This is where knowledge of their language will prove indispensable.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend's knowledge of French helped her in her call center job not long ago, when she took a customer's order in French, even though such calls are to be referred to a specific department at her company.

Xd8vVxPmaa	This is a trick question. <br>  <br>  I lived in St. Petersburg, Florida for 6 years (St. Pete Beach to be exact) and traveled all over the state during that time. What I found out in that time is that there isn't much of a "family" feel to the state. Most of it is all about tourism. I know, oooooh, aahhhh, living by the beach must be paradise. This is a temporary feeling. After a few months you won't even care about the water. <br>  <br>  Florida schools are some of the worst in the country. Water shortages are common. You will notice that there are tons of people living there and most of them could care less about you. After driving a few times you will notice even more people could care less about both you and themselves. <br>  <br>  Miami is a huge drug haven, so is Orlando. Both cities have high crime rates. <br>  <br>  If you insist on moving there be aware that Florida's population is around 15 million not counting the millions of tourists who come and go all year round. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is northern Florida near Gainesville.

pWtRasf6aa	EVERYTHING. I just took my niece for her first trip; she's 3 months old. She loved everything. My sister carried her in a Baby Bjorn and she rode everything without a height requirement. I went for my first time at 8 months old. Some rides have gun pops and that sort of thing, but my niece has always loved loud noises. <br>  <br>  Make sure you visit the Princesses and Fairies tent in Mickey's Toon Town at MK. Almost all of the rides do not have a height requirement, and those are defiantly ones to hit. Lots of kids like Pooh's ride, Dumbo and Peter Pan in Magic Kingdom, but I suggest trying it all. Let her pick, but don't think it'll be "too scary" for her. Disney was MADE for the children and the young at heart. Speaking of scary? Haunted Mansion is a lot of fun! It's my first memory of Disney World. <br>  <br>  Epcot doesn't have many rides, but they have this awesome Kim Possible attraction. At 2 years, I'm not sure how much she knows of Kim, but it's quite fun. It's an interactive scavenger hunt!

qpqZybQ1aa	North of 49's answer is wrong, so don't even bother reading it. <br>  <br>  Here's a clear and concise answer:<br>  <br>  It's all about the historical background actually. When the British took over New France, they quickly realized they would have no chance in assimilating an overwhelming French-speaking majority (though they tried - read Lord Durham's Report). So they allowed French Canadians to keep their (Roman Catholic) religion and their language. The Church is also largely responsible for the survival of the language. <br>  <br>  From then on, it has been an ongoing fight for French Canadians (later Quebecers) to keep their mother tongue alive as they are surrounded by a ''sea'' of nearly 300 million English speakers. In the 1960's, the language situation in Quebec had become so critical, that the government decided to pass Bill 101 and make French the sole official language of the province. <br>  <br>  The immigrant communities you referred to mostly all blended into the English-speaking community because back then, Catholic (and therefore French-speaking) school boards did not accept children who did not speak French (which inevitably hurt the French situation in Quebec), while Protestant (therefore English-speaking) schools admitted pretty much anyone, including immigrant children who did not speak English nor French. Only much later did Catholic school boards started accepting anyone, regardless of their skills in French. A second reason is because back then there was no law regulating school enrollment, meaning people could choose between either sending their kids to French or English schools. Of course, most immigrants wanting a better future for their children than their own, all wanted their kids to be schooled in English (see St. Leonard Crisis in Montreal). Bill 101 changed that and limited enrollment to English schools to English Canadians only or to those whose relatives had been primarily schooled in English. <br>  <br>  It is NOT true, however, that all commercial signs must be in French ONLY. It can be in both French and English, as long as the French is marked bigger. All federal signs are bilingual and by the way, Quebec is probably the second most bilingual province in this country. There are about a million Anglo Quebecers living here who receive all services in English (education, health services, media and most government services). <br>  <br>  So the basic answer is: We've been busting our rearends for the past 250 years trying to keep it alive and it's worked, so far.|`|azypqsphaa	Britain did not act as true victors after the battle of The Plains of Abraham, they agreed to allow the French people to have their own settlement and language but under the rule of the British Crown and it was accepted by the French...|`|7jM9Ghchaa	old habits never die?|`|f9No4eRBaa	There are hundreds of books on this subject and you could read for years about it.<br>  To summarize: The French had a lot of people here and they lived in very large communities/cities where nobody spoke English, so how could they learn? Whereas the other communities you mentioned were smaller groups and assimilated into English speaking areas, where Quebec was not.<br>  Canada has two official languages: English and French.<br>  Talk about the pendulum swinging the other way:<br>  In all Provinces accept Quebec, everything has to be bilingual. In Quebec, Bilingualism does not exist. It's all French. Commercial businesses get shut down and fined if they advertise in English.<br>  <br>  There are many, many communities where nobody speaks English and unless you know French, you are stuck. Some may speak French, but are too stubborn to do so and make an English speaking person suffer. <br>  <br>  I travelled through small rural areas of China two years ago and was the first Caucasian many of them ever saw and was able to speak English to any children I met to most store owners. I experienced the opposite during my travels to Quebec where nobody could speak English or they refused to. . . . . very pathetic !|`|Dd14BZncaa	To piss English Canadians off. They hoped we'd have been assimilated by now!<br>  <br>  Just look at the clichéd, deluded answers you are getting here!<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as provinces other than Quebec being bilingual, except for New Brunswick. Official bilingualism means ONLY that people are entitled to services from their government, i.e. federal, in their language whatever province they live in. De facto, anglos can get service in English from the federal government in Quebec, you francos will be damned before they get served in French anywhere outside Quebec, even by their federal government. I know this as a franco who has lived in Toronto for 7 years.<br>  <br>  Getting back to the original question, King George III allowed for French to remain a somewhat "official" language in Quebec by way of the Quebec Act of 1774 (see link below).|`|NwbgvzfXaa	According to the source link I posted below, following France’s defeat in Canada, the new British colonial authorities gradually imposed the use of english throughout Lower and Upper Canada. (Lower Canada later became the Quebec Province and Upper Canada later became the Ontario Province.) <br>  The people of Lower Canada were from France, spoke French, worshiped as Roman Catholics, and followed laws based on French Civil Law. The people of Upper Canada were from England, spoke English, worshiped as Protestants, and followed laws based on English Common Law. So there were significant differences between these two groups.<br>  Those speaking French became classified as Francophiles and those speaking English became classified as Anglophiles. So even though the British tried to impose the english language for all economic, trade, justice and public administration business, the Francophiles resisted and would not give up their French language. They always considered themselves different from the rest of Canada and wanted to maintain their own identity through their French language.<br>  Also around this time, America had just won their own independence from Britain. Some American revolutionaries were uncomfortable with Britain occupying Canada literally next door. So to prevent an invasion threat from America, Britain decided to reach a compromise with the Francophiles in return for their support. This only helped to unite the Francophiles and increase their negotiation power in dealing with the British government. <br>  There are even rumors of Quebec seceding from the rest of Canada even though Canada has two official languages: French and English. Many Canadian politicians speak both languages. Many federal jobs require an applicant to speak both languages. Here in Ontario, all traffic signs, most documents, and labels on food and products have both languages. <br>  Schools in Quebec require all non-French speaking students to learn the French language. Surprisingly, they also require all non-English speaking students to learn the English language. As for adults who want to live in Quebec, they offer free French language instruction. <br>  Although the French language dominates in Quebec, English dominates in the remaining Canadian provinces.<br>  <br>  I'm an American who has lived in Canada and someday hope to become a dual citizen.<br>  .|`|L2QdPvSUaa	Culture if you just want a simple answer.

AA00000203	It depends. Not on your citizenship, but on the airline(s) involved.<br>  If the outbound trip connecting flight is on the same airline, *or* an affiliate airline, you will get both boarding passes. If the second leg is on an airline unrelated to the first, you likely will have to exit the airport, collect your luggage and check back in.<br>  <br>  You will only get boarding passes for the outbound flight(s). For the return flight(s), you get those upon departure. Boarding passes only start getting issued 24-26 hours before a flight (depending on the airline), that is why you usually can't get them at the time of departure.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	after I check in and get my boarding pass, will I also get my boarding pass for my connecting flight, or will I have to go to a check in at my connecting airport to get a boarding pass? <br>  <br>  ---You will get both passes when you check in. In some rare circumstances you may need to get a new boarding pass, but odds are 99% you get will both when you check in.<br>  <br>  <br>  Will I get my return boarding passes, or will I only get those when I check in before I leave from my destination?<br>  <br>  -- This is you will get when you return back to the airport for your flight home. You will not get in on your outbound flight, only when you check in for your return.|`|AA10832514	These are all really good questions.  The problem is that it will depend upon each country's policies on transiting and your citizenship.  If you're an American citizen, you probably will be able to check your luggage through to your first international destination.  You'll probably have to claim your baggage, in London, for example, and go through British customs.  You'll then re-check your baggage and get your connecting boarding passes.  <br>  <br>  These policies are all very fluid, depending on the airline's policies and national travel regulations.  Prepare for the worst.  I've had to claim my baggage like this on several occasions and schlep it across the airport.  Good luck and enjoy.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	When you check in at your departure airport you will receive your boarding passes for both flights to your destination.  You do not check in at each airport.  When you arrive for your connecting flight walk off the plane and go to a monitor and find your connecting flight gate.  Go directly to the gate on the monitor and verify in person that your connection is departing for the gate that was on the monitor and verify the departure time.  Boarding will start 30 Min's before the sched. departure.  After you has verified that your connection is on time and that you have the right departure gate if you have time you can get something to eat, use the restroom or shop.  <br>  <br>  When you come back you check in again for your return same deal.<br>  <br>  Have a nice trip :)

Dd14BZncaa	Not quite true, but not far off...<br>  <br>  Some of the Acadians deported from Acadie, i.e. parts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, in 1755 were relocated in what is now Louisiana. That is where you now find a whole lot of people with French Canadian names ending with an "X" such as Thibodeaux, Comeaux, Braux, etc.<br>  <br>  The truth of the matter is, through the decades and centuries since French settlers came over to North America, most of them were illiterate, as were the clergy people who registered their names. As a result, the same name could get spelled various ways. My own great-grandmother's name was spelled two different ways on her birth certificate itself!<br>  <br>  The "X" was really just a way to "standardize" the name because there were so many ways to write it. The first link below should provide information on the "X" names, and the others will explain why names were written in so many ways.<br>  <br>  The last link below will provide information about the deportation.|`|f9No4eRBaa	That is a myth I never heard of until reading your question.<br>  There is no such thing . . .I even googled it and nothing comes up.|`|azypqsphaa	no that's ridiculous|`|2wyDALHgaa	It was that way until Micheal and Janet Xerox petitioned the Govt to allow them to come into the country to start the Canadian division of their company.

eD7qRBKHaa	Yes, that should be fine as long as it is a card with a high enough balance.  They will put a charge on there which will "hold" the money for a few days until it processes, and it may be a charge of more money than the charge is actually for. It often is on a debit card.  For instance, some gas stations will put a hold of $100 on every purchase on a debit card, and then when it goes through for only $20, the rest is available again.  So just be sure you have a little extra cushion.|`|99dde179de70f1317248d9ffaaf554b0aa	as long as it has the visa or mastercard logo it will be fine|`|NaT5dYU1aa	You can  - it is to hold the reservation.

You show up before noon and put your name in the box. At one o'clock they pick a certain number of names at random, depending on how many seats they have available. And if your name gets picked, you can get up to 2 tickets for $25 each. There's no guarantee, but it's worth a shot. Also, if you happen to be a student, a lot of shows offer discount tickets with a student ID. I'm not sure if Avenue Q is one of them, but you can ask at the box office.|`|fFnsJ7maaa	Definitely the TKTS booths.

Be consistent, persistent and punctual. never speak to a manager if you don't look presentable. When you interview you HAVE to be the best from the bunch.

pm2EeEgiaa	Yes. Among ethnic Filipinos, if a boy or male is not circumcised, he is called a "supot" - but he is not really considered outright as "gay" - rather, he will be considered as having the likelihood of being gay.<br>  <br>  This stems from history, when men during the pre-Spanish times are routinely being circumcised because of the spread of Islamic culture to the Philippines (even among people from Luzon and Visayas who weren't Muslims).<br>  <br>  Even so, many Filipinos don't get circumcised - especially those of Chinese, Spanish, or American descent.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for being gay - yes, the Philippines is the most tolerant Asian country for homosexuals - there are no police raids or violent protests against gays here - and they have the right to do anything - the only exemption are marriage and military service.|`|0cOGZXQNaa	when a person's not circumcised, he's called 'supot' right?<br>  -yup<br>  <br>  <br>  does that mean people consider him gay?<br>  - nope. most guys in the philippines are circumcised right before or during puberty, maybe like ages 9-13. in filipino culture, circumcision can be likened to a "rite of passage"- from from boyhood to manhood. so not going under this "rite" suggests being immasculine or not being man enough to go under the rite, or at least to some: that's the only explanation that i could think of as to why "supot are accused of being gay. however, this belief is so primitive and homosexuality is yet to be understood when it was still popular. and of course, extra foreskin would not make a person gay. <br>  <br>  <br>  and do you guys accept gay people?<br>  -sure. in fact, gay people are quite popular and they dominate the philippine media- especially in comedy<maybe a good reason to call them gay! lol). as far as gay bashing is concerned, rarely does this happen physically. peak of gay bashing: school-age when kids piss each other off the most.|`|EHw8zCgJaa	I'd say close to 100% of Filipinos would agree that being 'supot' is at least a sign of weakness or effeminacy. However, that doesn't really make everyone convinced that if a male is uncut then he is weak, weak, thus effeminate, effeminate, thus gay. <br>  Some bigoted Pinoys, like those who have never even stepped out of Philippine borders, will be most likely prone to thinking that uncircumcised people are gay because we use circumcision as a rite of passage, kinda like an admission test in college- you don't make it in the quota, then you've flunked, that's it. <br>  Most educated Pinoys are more open-minded and would rarely even think of a direct relation between circumcision and homosexuality.|`|VGMFkcziaa	Not really. If he act gay then he is gay but it doesn't  mean if the guy didn't circumcised they're already gay.. gays also got circumcised so what you call them, they not gay? duh!|`|WiAObjkSaa	im not a guy but i want to answer your question LOL.<br>  :P<br>  <br>   . yaahh ur right! when the guy's not circumcised, he's called<br>   supot. and that's true. :D<br>   . but you can't just consider him as a gay <br>   . why? maybe because, they have some reasons why they're<br>   not circumcised. it doesn't mean that they are already <br>   a gay. we have different reasons why we do this thing or why we don't do this such things. :D <br>   . for me, as a girl i accept those gay people coz i wantto have a gay   FRIEND! haha! because, they're so nice and funny to be with, in addition to that, if you have this kind of friends, you can learn some things especially those "gay" words they blast through their mouth! it's soooo funny and for me it's great. haha. :D that's all. :)|`|JYLbyWkSaa	not all uncircumcised men are gay.<br>  not all gays are uncircumcised.<br>  <br>  Naman! i accept all gay people. they're tao din naman...|`|ogA7oilxaa	being supot is not gay. not the same. altho its better to be gay than supot. lots of teasing from kids when another kid is supot.|`|dl97DmmYaa	when a person's not circumcised, he's called 'supot' right?<br>  Right.<br>  <br>  does that mean people consider him gay?<br>  No.  Gays are homosexuals and like same sex friends.

They act weird.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Two different things.<br>  Not Circumcised is "Supot"<br>  Gay is "Bakla" a lady boy. Gay is a way of life that many consider as normal now.

NaT5dYU1aa	The benefit of after hours is not having the long lines for the rides.  The shows and parades are generally during the regular hours so really no added benefit.  Going to Disney is exhausting - even for children.  Around 3 o'clock the parks clear out for awhile - naptime!  By 9 (usually the last light show), you are carrying your children out of the park.  While being onsite may save you parking, there are other considerations: <br>  <br>     -  If you are off-site, you usually have better access to other and cheaper dining.<br>     -  Does your hotel have a shuttle to and from the park (and better yet to and from the airport)?<br>     - Will you want the convenience of being able to run back to the room easily for a "nap"?<br>  <br>  Have fun - 4 kids - you may be the one wanting to go to bed early!  lol ;)|`|eD7qRBKHaa	I think that would be a lot for kids that age.  If you are planning to be there close to opening every day and stay close to closing, then no, I really don't think the extra hours are going to make that much of a difference.  And yes, the shows are during regular hours - nothing special happens during extra magic hours.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	i guess it depends on your kids. my niece and nephew can go from 6am-12midnight and then get up and do it all over again so we enjoy the extra magic hours. (especially in the morning) and you can get on your favorite rides a few more times during the extra magic hours. <br>  it seems from your question that you don't think your kids are the "all go, no quit" kind so if thats the case then you wouldn't benefit from the extra magic hours. <br>  <br>  and yes the parades and fireworks displays take place during the regular park hours. the extra hours are more for going on rides.|`|0faf41af0485ebfdcf24e56b9ad3740daa	Yes to stay in the parks during extra magic hours you have to be a disney resort guest. Say extra hours begin at 7am you won't be able to get in the park until it opens to the general public. Same thing if the hours are later at night. You can get away with staying in the park if your there before the extra magic hours start but will not be able to ride any rides, they will check to make sure you are a resort guest. Just because you have small children with you doesn't give you any special privileges. It it well worth it to stay on Disney property with the extra magic hours and the buses that take you from park to park and back to your hotel. It might actually be cheaper, you'll be saving in gas money and money on parking.|`|xSHRJw46aa	You will be fine and have a great time.  There is plenty of time in a day for children that age.  If you are there for several days, you may even want to leave early or go in late one day so they can catch up on sleep anyway.  There are usually parades more than once per day, and fireworks somewhere every night.  Get the schedule somewhere at the front of the parks when you enter each day.<br>  <br>  By the way, some of the taller hotels that are off site have fireworks views also.  The two story motels probably wont, but it does not hurt to ask.<br>  <br>  Wish I was going too.  Have a great time and don't sweat the extra magic hours.<br>  <br>  The Disney Tips page on the site below has some stuff dealing with taking little kids.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Yes the parades and fireworks are during regular hours. but you might want to consider early magic hours. Getting to the park early and not having as much as a crowd, you can get the kids on more rides with less lines to wait in. <br>  Magic hours can be the park opening early as well as staying open late.|`|73ac745efcfce839836e14b0f116395baa	Well, i suggest that you don't use the Extra Magic Hours at night. They are way too crowded, and it's dark out, and it's dangerous for the kids. In the morning, it's only one extra magic hour. I'm sure you won't be missing out on alot if you skip one hour of rides and shows! Definitly go with what you are feeling. Just think if you're going to be missing out on stuff. I personally would stay off Disney property if i were you, and stay for a few extra days? If you're up for it? :) haha<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a safe and MAGICAL trip (;|`|fzK5oOpdaa	Yes they show fireworks and parades during the normal hours. Extra Magic Hours are more of a convenience to the guests staying on property. They are helpful, but not essential or necessary.

lcj1AKt1aa	You can come to Barbados, it is a lovely island.<br>  <br>  Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.<br>  <br>  When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.<br>  <br>  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere.

Not if you "want to go to places with a lot of clubs and alot of things to do". <br>  <br>  For real clubs with huge, sophisticated nightclubs scenes you need to get outside the U.S. so you can get past that high 21-drinking age, which is a barrier to the 18-20 year old crowd at virtually every club worth visiting. (Nobody takes seriously the "under 21" teeny-bopper clubs).<br>  <br>  That's why Cancun, Jamaica, Bahamas, Mazatlan, Acapulco, etc. continue to offer the *BEST* spring break value for the SERIOUS college-age spring break partier.|`|rKGOtM7naa	some questions .. how many people are u going with .. what is your budget like .. and where do u live? also are u old enough to drink in the US?|`|jzXBUwT9aa	Iraq is cheap right now.

If you're asking about the Slovenian word for 'traditional dress' as in 'costume', then it's 'Narodna no?a' pronounced - Nosha. <br>  As for different terms for various parts of it, there are many really, because there are at least five distinctly different Slovenian traditional costumes, gorenjska, primorska, dolenjska, etc.

nF9DZ0sOaa	If you're going to be around the riverwalk area, you have to visit the Alamo, of course!  Also La Villita.  If the Aztec Theater has re-opened, pop into the lobby and look around.  Make sure you take a ride on the river barges...some of the barge pilots are hysterical!  Rivercenter Mall is usually quite popular with tourists.  The Buckhorn Saloon and Museum is a must see if you're looking for funky!  You're not far from the San Antonio Zoo and Sunken Gardens, or from a couple of really good museums.  Kids enjoy the HEB Science Treehouse at the Witte Museum.  The Tower of Americas downtown is in Hemisfair Plaza, site of the 1968 World's Fair.  And of course, when you're on the Riverwalk, plan to eat at Casa Rio, the flagship restaurant of the Riverwalk.<br>  <br>  Have a good trip!|`|3PuKXEwZaa	Market Square is downtown also.

Visit La Villita and El Mercado downtown for lots of shopping.  Go to River Center Mall and see the story of the Alamo at the IMAX theater and then go to the real Alamo, which is the number one tourist destination in Texas downtown for FREE. You will enjoy the River Walk, which by the way is the number two San Antonio attraction, also free.

Lmw6dtQvaa	I have lived in 4 different places in SD. Your LARGE dogs will hinder you. And your price range for La Jolla and some other Nice areas will not be an easy thing. San Diego is expensive. Most likely you are going to need a house. La Jolla is very nice but will cost. And it is a bit "SNOOTY" I will assume your are 18-22 years of age and you may not want to HOB NOB with the "OLDER FOLKS"  Pacific Beach is a very young crowd. It's a bit dirty. But it's a beach town. Mostly apartments for collage students and beach bums. Ocean Beach is mostly the same. Ocean beach has a reputation to be the SURFER DUDE place. You will find many 40-60 somethings still smoking the erb and hanging out.<br>  <br>  Yes these places... try to avoid:<br>  <br>  national city, extremely ghetto<br>  <br>  chula vista<br>  I have to disagree with CHULA VISTA. This community has grown. It has a nice feel and The new community EAST LAKE has made Chula Vista much nicer. But some parts are bad.<br>  <br>  la mesa<br>  el cajon<br>  encanto<br>  logan heights<br>  <br>  The last 4 years I lived in San Diego I was in a Studio in BANKERS HILL. Also know as MIDDLE TOWN. This is just up the Hill from Down Town. And just south or HILLCREST. Bankers Hill over looks Down Town. It has many HIGH end homes. Mansions even. They are all tucked away in canyons and shaded private drives. It is only a walk to Balboa Park. Great trails. 20 min walk to Down Town and the Ball Park. Hillcrest has some great food and artsy places. Hillcrest is the hub of the gay community. Just WEST of Hillcrest is MISSION HILL. Only 2 to 3 minutes away. It actually sometimes get confused what is Hillcrest or Mission Hills. Mission Hills has some nice houses. The people in MH take care of their lawns and homes. It's very family oriented. Dogs all over the place. It should only be about 10-15 min away from SDSU. Just remember the closer you get to the water the more it will cost.<br>  <br>  SAN DIEGO MAP of the Area.<br>  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=CC5&ei=bzGjSY7VK4jYnQe9w9X8DQ&resnum=0&q=middletown%2092103&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=o...</a>|`|fkHBVn7taa	should also check out crime maps . . here is 2008 list <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/police/pdf/200812cumneighbor.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandiego.gov/police/pdf/20081...</a><br>  <br>  First off try craigslist.com you know da deal!  <br>  La jolla would be awesome but kinda ritzy and that is pushing your little 20 minute drive. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.housingmaps.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.housingmaps.com/</a> is a great site where you can use Google maps and Craigslist listings. . pretty sweet! <br>  <br>  La mesa has some niice places allowing dogs although watch the crime. <br>  <br>  This site seems to have some cheap rentings <a href="http://www.myapartmentmap.com/apartments/ca/san_diego/" rel="nofollow">http://www.myapartmentmap.com/apartments...</a>|`|q6w8wnX2aa	live in the apartments in mission bay your so close to the beach|`|bxW3iX53aa	well no affence, this is a little off topic, but i would suggest NOT transfering to sdsu. first of all it is extremely hard to get in, they only accept applicants in the fall, and you dont want to, trust me. i am a student there and i always try to talk people out of it because it is the worst school i have ever attended. yes it is pretty and the people are cool and the parties, but the professors do not know what they are teaching, they are not helpful when you need them, TAs usually do all the work, and the class rooms are squished and run down..<br>  <br>  but to answer your question :) its going to be a little tricky to have 2 large dogs in an apartment. most dont have backyards and if they do they usually make you pay an extra amount a month per dog. if you are looking to get the college experience stay in the sdsu area, if not, nice, clean, convinient apartments i would suggest chula vista. ignore the person above me, anywhere EAST of the 805 in the south bay is gorgeous. its a brand new town called otay ranch and there is also one called eastlake. i love it down there. there is a mall, and a college is in the works. a little more pricey but you may be better getting what you are looking for there...<br>  <br>  also my suggestion would be the fashion valley or mission beach area.<br>  <br>  all are within driving distance. the most you would drive is probably 20 min|`|PXBm6jovaa	try to avoid:<br>  national city, extremely ghetto<br>  chula vista<br>  la mesa<br>  el cajon<br>  encanto<br>  logan heights<br>  <br>  those are probably the worst areas in SD

I'm SURE that they wouldn't even really notice some girl @ 14 years old as a minor, as long as she had a ticket.

For stuff like food stamps, wic, medical care, social services is the place to go especially if you aren't signed up for medicaid yet and aren't insured. <br>  I don't know exactly how everything should be done but hope that helps a little?|`|AA12086491	Find a shelter, there are organizations that will help you.

kgBPU4xxaa	Traveler's checks are not widely acceptable here in Italy; you would have a very difficult time finding a store that would accept them. You're much better off with an ATM card. ATMs are widely available and almost all of them are on the major international circuits. You don't need to open a special bank account at any particular bank to use the ATMs. Here in Italy an ATM is called a Bancomat.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	In most countries you can use your normal ATM card at many machines in the capital cities and tourist cities. Contact your bank to ask them about this, and bring a Visa or Mastercard for emergencies.|`|TcgUVcYwaa	Visa credit card is the answer, do not bother with Traveller's Cheques (they are a thing of the past). Contact your bank and ask about overseas travel using your ATM card. If they cannot help you consider getting a Citibank or Bank of America checking account. Citibank is most useful for Germany, Bank of America might be more useful for other countries. You can look up locations of International Citibank ATM's on www.citibank.com, BoA might have a similar service.|`|dndFiZrIaa	i wouldn't bother fussing with traveler's checks. honestly, i think your best bet is to take some cash with you for the necessities and other than that use a plain old visa credit card.. and then pay your bill when you get home. I lived in brussels for 6 months in 2007, and i took some cash with me (not enough to last 6 months obviously).. I also took a visa card, and my debit card that has a visa logo. you can use your bank card at ATMs in Europe, but it may take you a little while to find an ATM that works. When I lived in Brussels, I found that only one bank had ATMs that would accept my card, and that was Fortis Banque. I also traveled to france, germany, luxembourg, switzerland, czech republic, hungary, austria, the UK, and the netherlands.. and I generally had little trouble with ATMs. However, my bank here in the States charged me $3.50 each time I made a withdraw, so I was taking larger amounts of cash out of my account just to avoid paying the fee multiple times. That's why I say to simply take some cash with you and use a credit card for everything else... you avoid carrying a ton of cash and paying fees to withdraw money and going through the hassle of finding ATMs that work.|`|AA10436868	Travelers checks are the best way to keep your money safe, and you can also take your ATM card with you.<br>    Some banks in europe will charge you a fee, but that is better than carrying a lot of cash.
1bTYCUDkaa	No, they probably will not.  That would be ridiculous, and people would no longer travel by air, losing the airlines business.  If the airlines really are getting greedy for money, they will just start charging $25 for a first checked bag.|`|AA11496012	Airlines are getting creative with what they are charging but I doubt they will charge for carry-on luggage.  Part of the reason is because the price of fuel shot up to $147 a barrel.  Now that the price of oil has gone down, some airlines have lowered or gotten rid of the fuel surcharge on a ticket.  Also with the price of oil down, airlines may lose less money and some may be profitable.  Therefore charging for carry-on luggage is not necessary and will only make passengers more angry with the airlines.  Some people may end up driving instead of flying and that is not what the airlines want people to do right now.|`|95XbcD9Xaa	It doesn't seem like it. They have been charging $15 for checked bags, but it seems like just that. However, American will make you check your bag if it's over their 40lb. limit, and US Airways has extra staff at gates to make sure carryons aren't oversize.

18fa09ea50eedfe616b5d39863054b7caa	Bearcat campground in Lestervile MO.  You will be floating on the Black River if you stay here.  This river is really nice for anyone, if you don't have experience that is OK this river is perfect for that.  If you want a relaxing ride, again this is a great river for that.  Bearcat is an awesome campground they have both electrical and basic campsites.  They offer a ton of things down here, they have dinner on Saturday, Breakfast on Sundays and a stage that has bands and DJ's that perform.  If you check out their website you can find the different festivals that go on here.  We go to the Parrot Head festival each year and just love it.  They have all kinds of contest that weekend, DJ on Friday and The Phins on Saturday.  They also have a Tiki themed buffet for dinner.  There is the campsite decorating contest, costume contest and more.  All of their festivals are a really good time.  As for taking the canoes out you can rent from them and they drop you off at the start site.  When you are done the good thing is you end right at the campground so you don't have far to go.  Oh they also offer canoe lunches for $5 that are in a waterproof container.  You can't beat that!  Everone here is so nice and the campsite is well kept with nice sites and the cleanest bathrooms I have ever seen at a campground.  They also have FREE showers and hot water so you can't beat that!  I would check them out this is a great place to go with friends or family and it is in a beautiful part of MO.  I would at least check out their website the price list is on there.  For the area and the amenities they really have some of the cheapest prices around.

I suppose it's meant to be a compliment but I don't find it flattering. <br>  <br>  Asia still has a colonial hangover and a mightily twisted habit of getting down on and limiting itself - the reason why mixed race models and entertainers continue to be such sources of popular fascination, ojectified as trophies but subconsciously reviled at the same time.<br>  <br>  Every ethnicity has its own beauty. Beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder. <br>  <br>  Obviously, some around here need their eyesight (or heads, rather) examined.<br>  <br>  EDIT: lol @ brokenbudgie, nice one, girlfriend.

That's the most horrible facts about singapore girls to guys.|`|VGMFkcziaa	IMOW, i find the singaporean girls pretty than malaysian, thailander or vietnamese, I am filipina though, but i just notice that singaporean girls commonly found pretty if they're blood is only half of their race or mixed.. example if the mom is singaporean and the dad is european or western, i must say 90% of the child is a good looking same as any other asian race if got mixed to western race what you think would be the results. Secondly, i also believe with what are our genes have even if you are 100% of your race as long as your genes from your older generation you can see if got good looking people or not.. right? There is nobody happened that the parents are handsome and pretty but the kids look like a wolf..ofcourse if your parents are good looking your children would be 60% good looking too but also have to see the side of your partner.

You can shop at the malls, melrose or downtown(whatever you can afford and they all have great stuff). You can also go to the beach(Venice Beach) and shop or just sight see. It is sooooo much to do there. There is a lot to do in LA all together.Clubs, Shopping, Theme Parks, Museams, Cute guys and Girls. You can go to Rodeo Drive, Santa Monica Beach and Pier, Hollywood Blvd, Griffith Park, The Beverly Center or just attend a TV taping(The Tonight Show) for free. I can go on and on. And last but not least, you can always take a quick flight or a 3-4 hour roadtrip to Vegas. Thats clubbing and gambeling all day long. Well, goodluck on whatever you decide.

AA10962298	Appalachian Trail<br>  ATC traces its roots to the vision of Benton MacKaye, a regional planner who convened an Appalachian Trail “conference” in 1925 in Washington, D.C. This initial gathering of hikers, foresters, and public officials laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a trail, but also for an organization to build, manage, and protect it. Today, through the efforts of volunteers, clubs, and agency partners, the A.T. extends more than 2170 miles from Maine to Georgia within a protected 250,000 acre greenway. ATC was instrumental in the passage of federal legislation that designated the A.T. as America’s first national scenic trail in 1968. <br>  <br>  In order to coordinate the efforts of 30 member clubs and their volunteers, numerous federal and state agencies, and close to 40,000 members, ATC employs approximately 45 regular staff and numerous seasonal program employees. With a main office and official trail visitor center in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, ATC remains singularly focused on the A.T. with regional offices in North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.jkLXJ8MQKtH/b.856595/k.2E47/ATC_Offices.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.appalachiantrail.org/site/c.j...</a>|`|biKMQ2I1aa	Black Water Falls, West Virginia

Elle fut, à une époque, le siège du parlement de Bretagne, son Duché et sa Chambre des Comptes. On oublie trop vite que c'est à cause de l'occupation que Nantes a été séparée de la Bretagne.<br>  C'est aujourd'hui une ville très agréable, assez verte malgré de récurrents problème de circulation. Une ville moderne et dynamique à moins d'une heure de l'océan. D'après ce que j'ai lu, Nantes fut déclarée ville la plus agréable d'Europe par le magazine Time en 2004.<br>  Une ville sans cesse en essor, un phare pour la c?te ouest.

809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	If you aren't already, get well acquainted with hostelworld.com and hostelbookers.com. These websites allow you to book accomidation in youth hostels pretty much anywhere, and if you're travelling by yourself hostels are the cheapest way to get around. Unfortunately hostels aren't as common in the US as they are in many other countries, but they do exist in a lot of big cities and some touristy towns as well. Hotels vary in price, of course, but a room in a hotel that isn't in a city center will probably set you back $50-$100 (common US chains include best western, motel 6 (which is cheap), holiday inn (more upscale) days inn and quite a few others. A meal at a restaurant for lunch would probably cost $5-$10 and dinner $10-$15 (note that taxes are not included when US prices are listed and a 15% tip is standard when ordering at a sit down restaurant). You can also cut down on this expense if you can cook for yourself.<br>  <br>  If you really watch your budget you can probably eat and sleep for less than $50 a day. Of course transportation and doing cool stuff costs extra. Make sure you have access to plenty of money.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Depends on where you go.  Big cities cost more.<br>  <br>  The best you can do is find a farm that is willing to give you room and board in return for you helping do jobs around the farm.  Then you can live for nothing.|`|xm441ADLaa	There is no answer to this.  I will depend on what city you visit, what you do while you are there, what types of accomodations you require....<br>  <br>  I mean, you could bring a tent and spend zero dollars on living arrangements or you could spend $1,000 per night at a fancy hotel suite or anything in between.  I went on a business trip last month and paid $29 per night at a crappy little motel.  Its really up to you.|`|t1lUBO4Raa	Like he said, depends where.  But assuming you want to live in suburbia somewhere near a fairly major city, assuming you're single, no dependants,  assuming you have a decent job, assuming you're renting an apt and not buying a house, you can probably get by on $1000 a month.  That's equivalent to minimum wage roughly so you'll be living hand to mouth.|`|1mwx2OZRaa	That's really gonna depend on where in the US you are... but Average Hotel where I live for a week would be $200 a week and you could make it on about $150 a week for food. So roughly $350.|`|IrBJ5ARDaa	It mostly depends on where you go and where you're willing to stay..Price line might be a big help in this case..
1FZtoOWhaa	I would actually say at least an hour.  Narita is a big airport, and the line ups are long (as if the old ones weren't long enough) because of the fingerprinting and picture taking they do at immigration now.<br>  <br>  If in doubt, check with the airline.|`|Hp85Wzf0aa	I say give yourself at least an hour and a half....to be on the safe side....especially with customs. A buddy of mine almost missed our plane to hiroshima because of steel toes boots in the bottom of his bag....Customs is customs so plan accordingly....best of luck to you.|`|AA11286432	when booking your ticket through agents or online, the reservation system will not allow a connection time with insufficient buffer time.  IN the case of most airlines connections to China from NRT, the transit times are about 2-4 hours and you usually do not enter country formally.  The airline directs you from one plan and on to the passenger terminal.  You will not go through immigration and customs.

63ff1e2e36a5822cdda3d11750463689aa	Well, I live in Maine, but I travel to mass often, so I know lots.  In my opinion, Maine is a better choice because it is less expensive, is more natural and pretty,  and has a higher quality of life, but let's move on... The schools are the top in the whole country, so you will not need to send your children to privite schools =] The best paid jobs are standard business, engineering, and science.  The best is medical, because massachusetts is the leading health care state. Nightlife in Boston is nothing in comparison to NYC, but is decent. Transportation is OK. The subway (the "T") is a little confusing, and traffic can be an issue on occasion, but it isn't too bad.  The safest towns to live in are the sprawling suburbs (just like in most places). Newton, Ipswich, Medford, are all pretty safe.<br>  <br>  Ok, that's about it....|`|YrChTlqvaa	.

The agency was planning to send about 20 buses from four cities in Alabama, but may have to find more. <br>  <br>  "We're looking at 1,000-plus people," he said.

Not so dangerous, and much easier to "wing it."<br>  <br>  For Africa:  You really need a good travel agent.  Like me! :)  A good agent can plan you a custom trip, with the itinerary being as structured or free-flowing as you prefer.  You need someone who is specialized - most of your corner travel agencies know little to nothing about Africa.<br>  <br>  Can I help you plan your trip?

I am very torn because after alot of research, it seems to go both ways. I have read they take security deposits and do not follow through with the "free cruise" but do not return the deposit. Also, I have read that after leaving their office, you do not have your vacation as if it never exsisted. BUT I have read people say that they got their vacation and ended up having a great time. I am supposed to go to a meeting this weekend and I am very unsure what to think. If you really can get free (cheap) cruise, it really is worth the hour or 2 of my time.     Please let me know your experience if you end up going to listen to the sales rep.|`|YQj7IIMfaa	Hi cougar,  I'm with Sundance Vacations. You are absolutely right, nothing is free and neither is this offer from Sundance Vacations.  The cruise is not a prize that you have won, it's an incentive to listen to our.....you got it....sales pitch.  The group presentation is 45 minutes, last 15 minutes are reserved for personal questions.  Another responder warned of high pressure sales.  We think our presentation is light and fun.  How much pressure can we exert in 15 minutes of one on one time, anyway?     You may have been summarizing in the post above.  The traveler is responsible for the tax, port charges and security fees. The most frequently asked questions about the 3 night cruise are covered in writing on our website.  http://www.sundancevacations.com/faq.htm...

AA10982716	You can get a draft beer in a bar for usually around 4 francs. It's not a whole pint though, it's 3 dl, a bit more than a half-pint. 5dl would be around 6 francs, so something like 4 pounds.    Food--a simple main course (spaghetti or a sausage and fries, for example) in a simple restaurant (like on the ski slopes), around 15-20 francs. More elaborate meal or fancier place, expect to pay 80/person for the whole meal, including wine.    ETA: Nathu's drink prices are accurate for a higher-end club or a specialty beer. Mine are for more of a pub-type place. I have no idea where he gets his milk, though, it's 1.25 at Denner for HochPast and 1.35 at Migros for UHT (both 2.8%). I usually get it at Coop but couldn't find a receipt but it's no more than 1.85 including a subsidy to the farmers.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	very expensive country, for rish people.|`|wE0yO2Kraa	A 500ml beer in the city or ski resort will cost you 8.50CHF.

There are many variables so if you want a more detailed answer pop a question on http://www.shootingthecheese.ch/ which is a discussion site for people living in Switzerland, and you will get some more answers.|`|AA11728141	what is the difference Switzerland or France.

If your idea of a fantastic vacation is to sleep on the beach and rest, may I suggest Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.  Montevideo, Uruguay looks real nice.  If your idea of a vacation is adventure, long hikes, and bunches of history, go to Peru, Columbia, and Ecuador.  This also may be best for the culture aspect and some places in these parts may be less touristy than Brazil.    Thought-If you like coffee, Columbia has some of the best in the world.  Maybe go to the Galapagos if you have time as well!  Have Fun!
mB8Q3iXqaa	Yes. Being a lawyer or a highly paid person in the United States and accepting a lesser position (and even struggling) in Israel is very noble.    I would have to agree.|`|8Ev0yYwdaa	I think its idiotic. New York is more religious then Israel, there are 10 million jews in the US and only 5 million jews in Israel.     Leaving any country for Israel is just dump, people are doing everything to get out of here, young people go to the US on tourist visas and stay there illegally like Mexicans. Those who don't get a visa go to the UK or to Australia and some even sneak to the US through Mexico and Canada.    I think its a secrifice to stay here, an Israeli could get along better then he get in everywhere else.|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	To some people, material possessions are not the most important aspect of life.

It is not a sacrafice if it's something you want to do. It's really cool to be in place that you can feel really at home. The standards in Israel are really rising anyway. Major currencies are weakening and the shekel is getting stronger. I would love to go and live in Israel. I think the problem is that most people who want to make alliyah can't afford to or can't speak hebrew. I don't really understand your question...|`|vm95h1hpaa	so what you saying? people not making aliyah are not sacrificing and they love money? maybe they dont agree with israel and maybe they hate war,|`|el8yX5q3aa	What the heck are you talking about?  they live there because that is where they think they belong...it isn't to get closer to God or friends or family.|`|AA12245463	It's certainly not a sacrifice for any Jews that I know!  They couldn't be any more excited about it.  .|`|wdyf1sueaa	It is my understanding that it is rather easy to find employment. People drive on modern highways, and stores are filled with all the name brands. There are many types of communities, and many streams of schools, enabling most people to find their place there.  You can buy a reasonable 2-3-4 br bright apartment. Although it might be a bit smaller than what some had in the USA. I heard most feel their quality of life has increased, not decreased.

MvisyrRVaa	Its doable. I myself took a small road trip when I was 17. My trip was only 4 states way from my home state though. Also I was staying with relatives too. If you are looking to go out on a trip and stay by yourselves, then keep in mind in order to even stay at a hotel you MUST have someone 18 or older (some hotels 21 and over) to even get you checked in. Sleeping in the car is very dangerous specially if you are unfamiliar with the area you are going to. Also be sure everyone would know what to do if you happen to have a flat tire on the high way, or a collision, or break down. Hope this helps a little.

In our country it is very difficult to change your name, except for this very reason.  I cant say I like my name but, it is certainly different and attracts attention to it, but it is no problem. In fact many people from Egypt and Turkey (and some other places) seem to find my name fascinating and when they see it, they wish to make contact with me ... LOL ... I wish it was simpler though ...  If I would change my name I would tell people my former name and why I changed it ... no need to hide it.    Rhonda, the very first time I heard your name was in a movie, talking about a song, I suppose it was that one. In Portuguese we have the word ronda which means a watch, a prowl ...  And Sam, I feel for you but it is such a beautiful name ...   I pray that one day you find the peace you need and be a happy girl.|`|FDjn05cNaa	Only in an exceptional circumstance...like that case in the States where those idiots named their kid after Adolf Hitler !   You've got to feel for those kids ....also the kids of nutso movie stars & singers who come up with all the weirdo names under the sun !|`|4sHJMnLXaa	Nope..never!    I like my name; Its relatively original..and pretty rare.    So far, I've only heard it once in Lebanon....and a few times in Egypt (but as a family name)    So....I'm sticking to it ;)|`|Nrj7ponnaa	Someone told me once that calling a friend with a different name cuts the vibration between you and that person.    If my name was old fashioned or I didn't like it, I don't think I would be ashamed of it.  I would just accept it.
