Call your Mom.  :)|`|RXe4guclaa	are you serious? jeezums.    2 slices of bread. put some mayonnaise on one side with a butter knife. add 2 or 3 slices of turkey or ham and 2 slices of cheese. add lettuce if you want|`|kOscjH4saa	for some reason i think your lying it just sounds a little odd of a story. but it depends on what you like on your sandwich. go to a deli dude.|`|WkLJI40baa	I guess there is no reason to replace the oven until you replace the girlfriend.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	How about I make you a knuckle sandwich?|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	The only people who die in "kitchen fires" are women who are lit on fire in India for not bring enough dowry into the marriage.

LIYSGdQraa	Definitely, the contractors base there prices somewhat on the demand for their services. With the economy the way it is these days there is a lot less work to go around, so the contractors would have more competition forcing them to lower there price in order to get the job.    If I were you I would call a couple of these guys back in to get a few more quotes and see if you can negotiate them down. They'll be much more likely to play ball with you today as apposed to a few years ago.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Assuming you can still get financing?    My architect tells me wood prices are dropping.  Do you really want cheap labor?  Look for price reductions on quality materials.    Also with construction projects diminishing, you can get it done faster which lets you go into production sooner, which increases your revenue stream, which helps offset the cost.|`|kR0l2ypxaa	The economy has a huge affect on everything. With businesses having less money to spend they will cut off projects that aren't necessary to keep going aka new buildings. It isn't always so because hopefully the business is growing and being prosperous but with the current economic status and the massive job cuts we hear every day of course it would affect the contractors

LbbawO7naa	When you have a dream from first person it means that your dream is actually NOT about yourself (weird huh?) It often means that you are speculating an event happening in your life, or a figure who is important to you. People that have 1st person dreams are either wanting to understand their environment more, or are more outer-aware then inner-aware. (so what the person said about being more in touch with yourself is completely false.)  You are most likely more sensitive to what other people are feeling rather then what is deep down inside of yourself.     When people have dreams in 3rd person its like someone backing up from a painting to see it better. Its like your mind zooming out so it can observe emotions, feelings, fears, etc; that are in you. (this is the opposite of first person dreaming) You should ask your husband if he is really 'him' in his 3rd person dreams, because a lot of the time, while speculating yourself you don't look like what you normally do.       hope that helped ;]  byee|`|119ef08c7749b873756963e35de2ab40aa	thats very interesting im always the first person in my dream aswell|`|U3gebnDLaa	No idea. Me too I'm always first person. Maybe it means you are more in touch with yourself ..
eWMn7dhKaa	It's favoritism, not discrimination.    If you are having issues with the way the bus driver is handling the pickups and dropoffs, you can file a complaint at your school office.|`|AA10106002	If it's a dangerous area for girls it is for boys also,so it's discrimination, but be a man about it.|`|IpbC2dUsaa	It's not discrimination if the location part is what you mean. That has nothing to do with the individuals or anything. Now, the fact that it's sorted by gender is certainly a potential grounds for a discrimination claim...|`|KWl605JTaa	beeat her A2   |`|zhk8o514aa	Bad area perhaps?  But I do know the school board will frown on that big time, because she is wasting a lot of gas.|`|7ES4xMloaa	bus drivers are not alloud to alter their pre-set rout|`|LNOsY8Jiaa	No, bus drivers are told where to drop off their passengers.|`|akHYRh5Raa	yea, report her!!!|`|KmwvwT6Eaa	sounds like that to me|`|j7l9gavRaa	tell the school administration|`|hZL7hCloaa	I wish that was what I stressed about. Don't worry about it|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	The Drivers route is probably set by the school, or bus company.  It's probably a pain for her too.  Suggest you talk to her about how to change things|`|IcnilUuUaa	I am not sure if this is discrimination, but since you feel that you are being treated unfairly you should tell the bus driver how you feel. Don't say it in a way that will make the bus driver get on the defensive.  If the bus driver still continues to do the same thing, you should go over her head to report it.|`|714af23aaae71e5eebdb479c36d6cd86aa	I can relate buddy.......happens to me too(not with a bus)    It's the old double standard.    We are not supposed to mind but we do don't we !    Depending on the mood I am in I will let it go.........    Other times it just irks the hell out of me..........    I mean...don't get me wrong.....I am all into male chivalry and stuff but geezzzzz........|`|AaXl3vcCaa	most of the time they give the bus driver a schedule that they have to follow for the order of drop offs and pick ups, its usually not up to the driver|`|uA2HeyqWaa	Maybe. Maybe the bus does not like you? who knows|`|QVjnAQ9waa	deal with it sucker.|`|EcqrbLz0aa	yeah it actually seems like it and a waste of a lot of gas|`|dUeDmb7raa	no    plus when do you get picked up?    most likely the further away people get picked up first in the morning, when its really early, so its only fair that they get to go home first|`|RXe4guclaa	yeah he/she seems to be sexist. talk to her about it or just deal with it. good luck!|`|ATejLGkjaa	I think the bus driver wants to get you alone... ;-) watch your back|`|J4v5xNg2aa	Sounds like sexism to me. Tell someone in the school office and they might be able to do something about it.|`|AA10827766	that is so weird! Maybe they're going alphabetically|`|AA11045056	Don't know if to call discrimination, but you should share this with parents. Doesn't sound logic why the driver would do this. I think it's ridiculous. I would be mad too...|`|tRUoj8cPaa	No its not, remember ladies and children first. Start being a gentlemen|`|f4pSZ9gwaa	well have you ever asked the bus drive why she dosent drop you off first before all those other people? Maybe its a route shes always taken and your stop would be out of the way. It could be discriminaton but i highly doubt it. your house could be closest to where she needs to drop the bus off. who knows. but you should consider asking her because theirs a chance she dosent even realize that you would think something was wrong.|`|AA10481849	Yes its discrimination. But its probably that the driver wnts to make sure the girls get in safely as opposed to the boys knowing that they can take care of themselves. If ur really upset, express urself to the driver n let her know how u feel|`|9ccYiWX2aa	Sounds a little odd.  Is your bus driver male or female? Could be favoritism...? Or could be the bus driver insuring the girls get home safely?... there are a whole lot of crazies out there.     Hard to know for sure.|`|6oM9kfK2aa	the driver is just old fashion...boy are more physical then girls...its kinda just manners, personally i think u should man up and take notes...but it is kinda discrimination depending on you culture and tradtions, there is a reasonbehind everything people do. i guess im old fashion 2|`|oLtcvloxaa	no stop wining|`|qz3aushgaa	Not really, and its not a big deal
kukhR1Gqaa	The economy is fluid, meaning it moves up and down.  Right now it is going down, but it will start coming back up soon.  People who believe our lives are so much better than others and it is our responsibility to help those in need need to take a reality pill.  People who live in Africa and the Middle East have a totally different mindset than people in America.  They have groups of people who have hated each other for thousands of years, and a bunch of whiteys with money trying to change that just creates hostility.    Furthermore, removing ourselves from the Chinese and Mexican markets would be the dumbest thing we could possibly do.  China is our largest trading partner in the world. That's in both imports and exports.     Mexico is the largest trading partner in the Americas.  Also, if you look at economical models, illegal immigrants are required to keep the economy where it is.  Imagine a middle class person with a college degree doing manual labor for less than minimum wage.  Ha!  Stopping trade with them would make our current economy look like a puddle next to an ocean.      Africa and the Middle East are by far the most unstable countries in the world.  The reason our economy is so bad is the 'educated' classes in America took out loans and mortgages they couldn't afford.  Why do you think the recession started in the realty and then to the banks?  Anyway, your idea is poorly researched and thought through, but that seems to be the case with most people who just listen to others and don't do any cross-referencing.|`|SHsIybhhaa	Sending what little money you have to Africa? The US gives 0.16% of it's income to World hunger. See link.  America can't be self sufficient I'm afraid - too many people and it needs too many resources. International trade is a very good thing for an economy - which is why the "buy american" clause in Obamas new rescue plan is a serious precedent that could damage world growth. (not that I don't think he's top notch)  So you're probably going to have to learn a little more about economics or do some research if you want to support your claims.

Everyone has a different view of what race has the most attractive people. I think that there are things about many different races that I find very attractive, it would be really hard to point out just one race.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Believe it or not- the MOST ATTRACTIVE people are the ones with the farthest racial bloodlines.

LbbawO7naa	Yeah I had one where I was with a futuristic family who dressed in white cardboard. And I lived in the same house except it had sliding metallic doors. And every time my bedroom (sliding) door open and closed rapidly it was a warning sign that a T-rex was going to come tumbling down the attic stairs.     (this was a re-occurring dream I had as a kiddy ;]|`|yYktdzxCaa	every night. i hate the ones were im being chased by fat people or monsters and a run real slow and i cant move and they come up and kill me. i also had a dream i could fly and i was in my hallway flying, when i scraped my elbows on the carpet and then i crashed and couldn't fly. i haven't had a flying dream since.
opgMrERgaa	LOL that is odd.<br>  im pretty sure i have.. i just cant remember at the moment|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	Yeah, I've had that happen. If you become lucid while your dreaming you can go anywhere you want with just the thought. Its pretty cool. <br>  <br>  In your case I  would say that is how your dreams transition. One ends and another begins. If you ever become aware that you are dreaming when your asleep you'll see that you go from one dream to the next dream pretty quickly. Each transition is like what you are describing.|`|arMazTdbaa	maybe its something like this...<br>  <br>  you tend to change quickly without realizing it but your friends being there means that you cant forget about them and other stuff like your best friend

MNNxs5u8aa	Second.  Answering...<br>  <br>  Well, you've painted two pretty pictures here, but I think there are at least three; likely many more.  <br>  <br>  But to some degree, at what point does a lie become the truth?  Your question is paradoxical, if not filled with gaps and cannot be fairly answered, but I'd rather not sit down with you and explain why.  The closest thing I can think of to what you are describing is the Truman Show... and that had many gaps...but was a good movie.<br>  <br>  So I would say if I could suspend belief of any realism in this reality you've described, and accept the scenario, then I would say I would try and start a new life and forget finding out the truth, as it was obviously not worth very much.|`|tFAKwsv6aa	Maybe a little happier if i've screwed up this life too much|`|XiOfPxpdaa	judai; i might panic in the begining but then look at it as an oprtunety to biuled apon something grate after all without a true idenety you can make your own easely<br>  <br>  yubel; i agree|`|Iu0AJDviaa	I did when i was 16 and mum told me that my dad wasn't my real dad.<br>  A year later he comitted suicide and then i met my real dad and he was a druggie and a real looser.<br>  But i am a better person for it now(im 35) as i believe that we are all rocks at the beginning of our lives and all the pain and hurt that we go through chizels away at us,making us into statues-some people go through their whole lives and are still rocks.|`|28d07970c3adc9d81a00eeb71a258aa1aa	Of course at first, I will be shocked and confused. But I love my family and I enjoy being with them. I would accept it. It's kinda challenging for me to know who the real me is.<br>  <br>  Why? Are you in that situation?|`|d6MDxrMlaa	I would apply for passport/birth certificate/etc and get my real identity sorted out,then I would just go......to wherever,find a job somewhere or whatever!|`|fs8BFZAzaa	i would think somebody went through way too much trouble in making a lie a reality...<br>  <br>  then it might be real and not a lie. if there is emotional pain it should be talked about and only the truth should be spoken. <br>  <br>  otherwise we have weaved a much tangled web that will never give the inner being a sanctuary to rest in.|`|xBDMqCL1aa	I'd abandon everything and move to Africa.<br>  <br>  Or Hawaii.<br>  Start a new life. Drink, be merry. Party. Maybe get a husband / life partner.<br>  Also, I'll learn to live freely.<br>  <br>  Have the best retirement (from an old life? lol) of my life.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|4P7N6XULaa	I am sure this is a film.

It happens to me all the time!<br>  I find it quite enjoyable and entertaining really; I usually get dreams that are more romanticized/coming from my heart and how I feel about people in my life previously/currently...

XP|`|iz46GABcaa	I always have the weirdest dreams when i have a migraine..I often try to sleep through a headache and i find i have the sort of dreams that force me to wake up.

3p6wp7DYaa	To calculate inflation, you need to use the following formula: (new price - old price) / old price. The result will be a percentage, which will tell you how much more expensive the goods you buy in both years will cost you now compared to the base year.     So if you used to get a basket of goods for $100 in 2007 and you had to pay $120 for those goods in 2008, your inflation rate is (120 - 100) / 100, 0.2, or 20%.     You don't have to find CPI first to find inflation. CPI is only necessary when you don't have the prices for the goods available, so you calculate inflation by comparing the CPIs for each year.     Good luck, and I would study by the textbook instead of spark notes.

It is all up to you and the abuse you have endured has given you tremendous insight, knowledge and wisdom..you can see right through the false losers out there..But you need to save yourself...|`|JdRTGIUYaa	you are 31 years old and have not been employed?

But I suppose, if you have severe self esteem issues, then that would be a problem. I dont know what to tell you there, but perhaps you'll find happiness when you lay your burden at the altar.<br>  <br>  See yourself as God sees you, the hearts of men are corrupt. He created you with intention, and knows every hair on your head. In the creator's eyes, you are perfect, as is. And any past sins are forgiven. God won't hold anything against you that you are truly sorry for. <br>  <br>  God bless, and I will pray for you right now, to find your way. Try a Nazarene denomination church.

wMeQoXkzaa	Exercise. Kickboxing is effective but you can do anything physical to release that tension that anger brings on. Try walking in place even or dance to music, get the blood flowing and while you are working out picture the anger being washed away and feel good and pleasure flowing into you through the top of your head and down to your toes.<br>  <br>  Regular workouts help you to control yourself when something happens because you will be better able to "hold it in" if your body knows there is a regular "release" valve scheduled in the form of exercise. You will come to look forward to it and miss it if you don't follow through with the workout. It can become quite addicting and the endorphins that your brain releases from  the exercise or dancing will leave you feeling so much better!|`|JdRTGIUYaa	When you are angry find something to do like take the energy write it down,clean your house just don't take it out on others it is not fair and it can get you killed.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	eating ice,it's coldness can erase ur anger;/quickly take a cold shower/or just leave to the place or ppls.that caused ur anger...|`|98sa7yQjaa	i usually kickboxing but it ends up with me crying in my bedroom but i think the best way to release the anger is sit a little bit with your own try to relax your head then go wash you face with cold water and then<br>  go out "never ever sit at home ,gets worse"
6P9PZAxRaa	Very normal indeed. As you get older, more is expected of you and depending on the country you live in, the age considered adulthood like 17 in your country can add to the pressure. I usually get depressed around my birthday as well but then I think about it and am thankful that I am alive. Regardless of what country you live in, I bet you can turn on the local news or hear about someone that has died or was murdered or in some places tortured to death. It's times like this I am grateful that I am alive and am able to live another day. I don't know what is your money situation but what I would like you to do from now on each year you have a birthday, buy something for yourself. If you don't have funds then do something nice for you. I look at birthdays as new years. Sure I celebrate the new year but I consider my true new year is my birthday since it's a celebration of the day I came into the world. I would love to talk to you if you need someone to talk to. You can go to the movies, visit a love one. I personally enjoy sharing my birthday with friends and family. If you prefer to be alone, I want you to do something nice. A purifying ritual of sorts. Take a shower or bath but unlike your normal shower or bath, use a scent of some sort, go get a haircut or if you are a female, do something different with your hair. Eat your favorite breakfast if you have the items. Since you are making 17, are you allowed to vote? Register and you feel so much empowerment when you cast your ballot. Sorry if you live in a country that doesn't allow freedom of votes. Overall, your birthday is your day and you deserve to be happy. Sure, it's ok if you get depressed leading up to or even after your birthday but make sure on your birthday you enjoy yourself to the fullest but legally! I wish you the best and Happy 17th Birthday!|`|HAxyuUvEaa	I recently turned fifteen and I totally freaked out. I spent almost an hour crying. It's like 'we're becoming adults? when did that happen.....and how do we make it stop'.

I was sad at 18 when I became an adult because in my mind I missed out on a lot of teenage experiences.<br>  <br>  Now I just turned 30 and wished I had done more in my 20's.<br>  <br>  Could you say "regret"?<br>  <br>  I regret not having more fun.  But then again it's not a matter of choice sometimes.  Sometimes you can't find fun and fun doesn't come your way.  What you got to remember is no matter what, there is always safe legal and healthy fun that can be found in simple things.  Reading the other answerers has opened my eyes to know that I am not alone and also you are not alone.<br>  <br>  On a side note, I suffer from depression so I went on some medication and am doing much better.  Of course medication isn't for everybody and you got to be careful with what doctors prescribe, they see you as a paying customer for business and not a patient for health these days.  But do a check up on depression.  If you're like me, you want to deny that you suffer from depression.<br>  <br>  So called, "I want to be normal."<br>  <br>  We all do, my friend, but whether facing missing out on stuff at certain age brackets or having medical mental or physical health problems, you got to also face the idea that you are not alone and there is a community of people who are just like you.<br>  <br>  At 17 you probably don't realize this: there are a lot of people who feel alone.  That their life is meaningless.  That they can't find any friends.  I read about university students feeling lonely but when I was at U I thought I was the rare person that felt lonely.<br>  <br>  Of course what does it matter what other people go through?  Just as your own life is okay... But it's really hard to think outside the box sometimes.  You just think of your own ideas and that dream world of great wealth and beautiful surroundings.  I guess life isn't TV and TV got this idea of Sweet 16.  Btw I watched 16 Candles a few months ago and it was pretty good.  Also check out Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink.  They all star the same actor (female).<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	You are super-sensitive still at 17. As you mature you should grow out of this completely unnecessary attitude.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	It appears that you dread leaving your teenage years and I have heard of others who feel that way.  You must realize that something is good about every year of your life.  You have probably had a wonderful young life and you will also find good in your later years.  Do something on your birthday that will completely take your mind off yourself.  Go to the beach, go on a long hike, go shopping or do some work for someone else.  I hope this will be a good remedy for your depression.
VpNCHEfZaa	To put it simply, Communism refers to a socioeconomic system where the ownership,control,administration and allocation of all resources is in the hands of the government. More like everything id nationalized and the main objective of the government is welfare maximization. Socialism on the other hand is broad set of economic theories of social organization advocating public or state ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods and also provides equal opportunities for the masses. This is rather similar with communism. Finally, Capitalism is when the ownership,control,administration and allocation of resources is in the hands of the private individuals with no government intervention may be just as a regulator but to a lesser extent. The main aim or objective of the private individuals in this case is profit maximization. Examples of capitalist nations you can try to look at The United States of America while Russia was socialist until recently when there were slight policy changes. And The reference to Obama as a socialist is due to his policies to try and avert the current economic crisis hence some policies which have or will result in the nationalization of various privately owned institutions. But in my opinion he is not much of a socialist. Hope I have been helpful|`|7pRrtnyZaa	Short definitions:<br>  <br>  Communism: everything belongs to the state. The state takes away your money, and redistributes it, so everyone is "equal"<br>  <br>  Socialism: The state takes away a lot (but not everything). You get free healthcare, education, etc.<br>  <br>  Capitalism: The state only takes away what's necessary (to finance military, public lightning, and stuff). You have to pay for everything, including healthcare, but the economy grows faster.<br>  <br>  Note that these types do not apper as described. Today's system's are the combination of these.|`|MzOmEFQNaa	On Yahoo Answers?  C'mon.

xBDMqCL1aa	We all have, quite vaguely, "colour receptor" cells in our eye areas.<br>  So ya, if we all have about the same number of respective colour-reading cells, we should mostly see the exact same colours. (Although my parents tend to see magenta as red. That scares me. What if I paint a house for a client and we don't see the same green?! Argh. The stress!)<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question; especially the green-pink part. o.o<br>  <br>  <br>  Y'know what, I may be wrong... Please see:<br>  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/10/051026082313.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...</a>|`|iz46GABcaa	I think maybe everyone does see the same colours but slight variations in people's eyes might make them slightly different tones. Colour blind people dont see them the same for example. Animals see different amounts of colour depending on how many receptors the have for colour.|`|8F3esAARaa	Every color absorbs all the colors in a color spectrum excluding itself which it reflects...So any color reflecting the color blue is called blue and that is what yellow or green can't do...Hope you understand the deep answer I gave!!|`|CsBUHVAiaa	It's the ultimate question.<br>  <br>  Never mind God's existence.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know.|`|7IjGzvqTaa	There isn't, in fact.  Generally speaking, we're pretty sure that everyone sees more or less the same colors, with the exception of the color blind, or those who were born with mental disabilities, simply because of the way all of our brains are structured.  For example, when you see the color red, it stimulates a certain part of your brain.  That's generally true for everyone; it's almost always that same part of the brain.  In the case of someone who is color blind, two or even three colors may stimulate the same part of the brain, causing their confusion.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, we don't actually know that we're all seeing the same color, but we like to assume we are.
8d8ejHPfaa	Wow.  Well, it sounds like you became a vegetarian because you think eating animals is wrong, as opposed to for health reasons.  Even though you thought through this decision according to your values, that doesn't mean you won't miss your old habits for awhile.  You seem to be trying to reconcile the idea that eating animals is wrong for you, vs. fried chicken just plain tastes good.  There is a forbidden fruit component in here also it seems, after a week it may be that you are becoming aware of what a difference this diet will make to your life, how many old habits you will need to overcome. You made this decision in the first place though, because you are aware that what you were eating was a living being at some point, that thought seems to gross you out, and this dream seems to be more or less reinforcing your decision...|`|AA11398340	Go back to eating good wholesome food.|`|AA11199260	Your subconcious mind doe snot like that  you become vegatarian.

cWuumdy7aa	Mathematics is a universal language. Yes!! It's a language whereas students consider it as a big problem itself. We would be lost to any point in history or right after evolution if it was't for the subject of numbers. Let us try to understand that mathematics s not a problem but an answer to all those who want to make money or look at their situation financially. Businesses are defined by what they profit from their operations. <br>  <br>  Interestingly, mathematics makes itself a symbiotic subject to finance, business, economics and even for military accreditations. Economics with mathematics is the answer for many economists who will make assumptions on the theory they would like to present on the workings of the economy but will realize their ambitions be met when they use numbers to explain their relative thoughts. <br>  <br>  Businesses understand their motions in the market with the help of maths under conditions what they need to achieve to be the masters or what they need to remain in the business at all. Developing understanding that we are all connected to the mathematics will help us look beyond the horizons of the stars. <br>  Math is important and relavent in economic analysis, these are just two components of economic analysis and not the only way to view an economic model, as most economic analysis can be done with graphs.

It would have scared me too. By chance has anyone posed the question to you, "Which would you rather have happen: 10000 people you don't know die, 100 people from your home town or your best friend?" or something to that effect? If you're studying any sort of psychology or philosophy, the effects of that could be presenting itself in your dream. If not, no biggie. Perhaps you've seen the one of the Final Destination movies and it scared you half to pieces. I know it did me. It wouldn't have surprised me if I had a similar dream after seeing one of those movies. If not, again, no biggie and your dream is purely representational.<br>  <br>  Here goes. I think it suggests fears you have about your world suddenly changing. Oh, and 80 friends is an awful lot. I don't think I've had what I call 20 real friends in my whole life and I'm getting pretty old. Anyway, you could be fearing a sudden and drastic change in your world. Are you anticipating any of life's big changes? Do you have anxieties and fears about your world and those in it suddenly changing. Your dream is your own personal subconscious telling you something important. Something you have anxieties or wishes about finds its way into your dreaming mind to tell you what your awake mind is too busy to notice. Ask yourself what changes are looming on your horizon.

Dealing with this or not dealing with it is leading you into confusing and unfamiliar territory where you feel like a lost visitor. Figure out what <br>  <br>  I actually feel that at the point where you ended up in the lobby,your sleep was disturbed just enough that this dream ended and a new one began. The glass wall is important. It suggest the destructive power of flattery. Sugar suggest denied pleasures. What are your issues with your siblings? Are you wishing for a relationship for yourself such as your brother has with his girlfriend? Do you fear such a relationship? Are you having or afraid of having problems with your sister? Has she denied you something important and left you disappointed. Important questions, but only you have the answers. Do some self analyzing and pinpoint your issues, anxieties, fears, and sources of anger. Go from there. Maybe you need to settle some differences with your family members or you're afraid of impending arguments and complications.

I don't think we've been too influenced by pornography.  I think parents may be falling behind the curve a little.

They grew up okay.  <br>  <br>  I guess you could say any free society will have a lot of porn because sexuality is a big part of human nature.  If the people want it and the government doesn't try to subvert it, it'll be available.  If the government did try to subvert it, then it would just go underground, again.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I prefer the stuff to be above ground where I can keep an eye on it.

3dwf2j7yaa	Incest in real life it's bad but as a fantasy it's normal. What is your reaction with his fantasy? If your repulse then it means that you have a different fantasy. If not, then you're in the same page. Don't judge him right away. If you are worried, ask him why he has that kind of fantasy. You need to understand and think if he needs treatment. Remember that we all have different kinds of fantasies, to others it would sound sick and to others it wouldn't.

7IjGzvqTaa	It's not that you don't speak eloquently, you just have a faster rate of speech than some other people.  If they can't keep up, then that's their own problem, isn't it?  (Unless you *really* need to tell them something, I 'spose.)<br>  <br>  I would suggest reading aloud to yourself.  You can do this in private, or you could read to siblings, younger kids at the library, etc.  Reading aloud usually causes you to slow down because you have to actually comprehend what you're saying first.  This slightly slower rate of speech can sometimes then be used when you're talking normally.  This way, your brain and your mouth are going at the same speed.

tcvQwTa5aa	yes,I have.When I was first dating my now husband,I had a dream where he said to me,"We're getting married in two years."At the time we were only about five months into dating and I was not contemplating marriage.Turns out we did get married a couple of months past the two year mark.So I saw that as a precognition.I've never told him about the dream as he doesn't believe in those sorts of things and would just find a way to ridicule it.I am fascinated by anything paranormal or odd(except for aliens,that scares me too much).My husband is more on the materialistic,worldly side of the equation and doesn't believe in it if you can't see it,hear it,etc.   :(|`|wIu9LSF0aa	yes, I have had a few of these dreams. One was when my friend and  I were just getting into a blue van, we were passengers, as I reached for the seat belt I noticed that it had been cut, it was then i realised that i has drempt about this moment and knew we were in danger! i told my friend that we had to leave now! she told me not to be so silly and we stayed, about ten mins later the van lost controll and rolled! we were ok just broken bones but one person was paralysed in this and both have never forgiven me for not making them all leave when I knew what would happen.and yes it all happened just as my dream had predicted even to the minest detail.|`|AbYdBwqOaa	i started getting a dream about three years ago about a really horrible thing happening to a person i love. the dreams continued for two years, and one year ago, that thing happened. i hadn't told anyone, since it was the first precognitive dream id ever had and id felt guilty about having this dreaming this awful thing about this great person. however now i feel even more guilty for not telling someone of my 'premonition' that begun two years before this incident happened. and it was predicted that the problem started approximately two years before the incident. <br>  i believe that if one has recurring dreams that could be precognitive, one should listen to them- or at least be aware of their contents. especially since in conversation and writing one uses repetition to reinforce a point, who knows? our brains could work the same way.<br>  <br>  but if you have a dream that you feel might happen to you or someone else, don't ignore it. you don't need to tell anyone (or maybe you'd like to, that's up to you) but do think about it and if you think someone could really be helped with a forewarning or perhaps advice, then deeply consider you dream and sharing it. dreams are personal and sometimes evoke emotions that are really hard to deal with, but i believe that follow your instinct and not going against it is all one can do in this area we know so little of. best of luck.|`|v3IobQCgaa	I dreamed once that someone gave me a warm hug, only to realize that he had wiped feces all over my back while hugging me!  lol<br>  I SHOULD'VE woken up feeling all warm and fuzzy... but I woke up a little disturbed, to say the least.  <br>  <br>  It is very similar to his future behavior toward me, really.  Really innocent and kind to my face... and sort of off-handedly shitty to me otherwise.  ("Accidentally" denying my MySpace comments, being blatantly nicer to my friends than he is to me, ignoring me when I ask for advice, etc. etc.)<br>  <br>  Note:  He's completely out of my life now.  ;-)  Hard lesson learned, too.  I became emotionally attached and it went on for three years, until I put an end to it last October for good.  Sad, but true.  (And you can tell he dug the power trip over me.  Watching someone adore him... and him holding kindness over my head and snatching it away before I could grab hold of it... like how someone would playfully dangle yarn over a cat's head.)<br>  But in the future, I am definitely going to heed those kind of dreams.  I won't take them as gospel, but I will definitely take them as valid hints and tread lightly in whatever situation it is telling me to do so.|`|ga9dgpJ6aa	If thats your question then its no, and for your other question since my last answer is no, then this one is no also.

etV271ARaa	Are you a good person? A dream of the beach or massive ammounts of water is the promise of blessing to come. Water is a dream archetype which means positive blessing or abundance to come. Its associated with school so its probably related to studies or something like that. However the massive changing rooms indicate theres probably a lot of changing to do. The labs and stuff transforming into other things means that the entire environment will change to acomodate the blessing/abundance coming your way. If you're religious, expect a spriritual blessing. My gut reaction to this dream is that God is preparing to give you something you've been asking for.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	I agree with Mike, it sounds like you have been hitting the books too hard and need a little more leisure time...

7IjGzvqTaa	Actually, your sister is correct; your brain does more or less shut down your voluntary muscles while you enter REM-phase sleep to keep you from flailing about.

Your voluntary muscle movement should return immediately.  I believe the first answerer is correct; this sounds an awful lot like sleep paralysis.

JI7NQ9TNaa	A year ago, people would have told you different advice, I suspect.<br>  <br>  You need to "think global", because obviously what happens in other countries (the US & Europe) can and does effect what happens elsewhere. Look for the bubble more in area of hard goods, rather than services. High heresy i know...but if the world market is sluggish after the bottom actually hits (it has not yet) consumers will be cutting back on the extras, so services on going to be shaky.<br>  <br>  Think about what people will actually want and need. If someone is "building a better mousetrap", that is where the money will go. I am betting the long term future will be rosy for energy alternatives---like wind power. Thirty years ago, it was considered crack brained...but with everyone wanting a cheap, renewable source of energy, I think the smart money end up there. <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|2FT7sVkbaa	food, and farming<br>  the economy is going to get much worse, and when nobody has any money they still have to eat|`|AA11809403	no idea what will be the next bubble.<br>  <br>  but the way to take advantage is to invest heavily in it AND get out before the bubble bursts.<br>  <br>  Knowing when the bubble will burst ahead of time is the trick.

vKFneEuIaa	It is important that people pay for what they get. Producers who get nothing in return for their production will have no incentive to continue producing otherwise. Our whole economy is founded on the principle of value for value. If you allow the freeloaders to mouch with impunity you might as well put a gun to the heads of every honest, decent and hardworking person and pull the trigger. Credit ratings differentiate between the good, decent, honest people and those with less credibility. It is very important to make these distinctions. When money goes into the hands of those who will use it productively, it benefits the economy. The people who just consume but do produce are deadends. They are a drain on the economy.|`|2FT7sVkbaa	If we did that then our dollar and our currency would be worthless, and you would see hyperinflation where a loaf of bread would cost $50

Good ways to fix this are simple speaking exercises.  These will help you with enunciation, and help you to learn to open your mouth more when you speak.  We usually go through several of these exercises before we start rehearsal for shows in our theatre department.  I would suggest Googling "theatre enunciation exercises" and see what turns up.  Usually, they're repetitive phrases that require you to use all of the muscles in your mouth; repeating them over and over can loosen up your mouth and people will be able to understand you better.  Many speech teachers use these same methods when they come across students with similar problems.|`|xBDMqCL1aa	It is very simple.<br>  1) Raise your pitch; and at times, volume. Being shy makes us speak lower, and lower sounds do not vibrate at a frequency easily distinguishable from ambient noise (ie; trucks, road noise, air-con, anything/whatever). Speak in a pitch one or two parts higher, just not high enough to be obnoxious/chipmunkish. *Shudder*<br>  2) Articulate properly. Don't say "I know that now" as "ainodano"/??. Nobody'll catch more than half of the letters, and thus won't be able to string together something understandable or within the context of the conversation.<br>  3) Look at them. This ensures the two of you are on the same wavelength, and at worst, reading each other's eyes / lips. Eyes - emotional meaning/conveyance. Lips - lip-reading in noisy or 'library' settings; very useful.

EMmGFqgJaa	Here is a excellent show about your question. It can be seen online. It was on PBS a few weeks ago. It's called Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/id/</a><br>  <br>  If you actually look at evolution it does not disprove god. Evolution says nothing about god or religion. You can believe in both evolution and religion. <br>  <br>  The idea of proving evolution as fact is not that simple. Scientifically speaking all the research that has been done to look into the theory of evolution has supported it and non has refuted it. A theory is no longer a valid theory if something goes against it. So for all the science has supported the theory of evolution. <br>  <br>  Just watch the TV show and it will clear a lot of questions up for you.|`|AA11626745	It's funny how many people subscribe to the theory of evolution as fact. One even refers to the fossil records as evidence. No hard evidence exists period. It remains a theory after 150 years because there is no hard evidence. All available evidence (if looked at from an unbiased point of view) supports IT. Microbiology is finding more and more evidence everyday on the side of IT. Fossils are old, manipulated unreliable news stories when it comes to supporting evolution. You want to see evidence...study microbiology. If you look at it with no preconceived prejudices, it will give you a new perspective. Evolution is a mathematical impossibility. To believe in it is to subscribe to a faith based religion. Microbiology is your credible witness though maybe not the one you want if you are looking to prove evolution.|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	Bacteria.<br>  <br>  You introduce a product that kills off most of the population.

You have Evolution. <br>  <br>  It's a series of very small changes (sometimes large ones) over a long period of time. <br>  <br>  It's certainly more credible than the Theory that Humans were created by something else.<br>  <br>  **********<br>  <br>  David Firnstahl is a guy selling crap. It has nothing to do with your question, it's a spam bot.<br>  <br>  *********<br>  <br>  Nobody said Life had to come from Non-Life.<br>  <br>  It's possible that Bacteria might have hitched a ride here and flourished.<br>  <br>  I find it funny you are trying to "disprove" it. By even saying that, you've admitted that it's a real and proven system. <br>  <br>  Hey Arizona guy.... what do you mean by "Evolution is a mathematical impossibility."<br>  <br>  You're saying that it's mathmatically impossible to have several Species of Finch evolve from a single Ancestor? What you are saying does not even make sense. <br>  <br>  Fossils also might be old, but they offer concrete clues. <br>  <br>  Lets take the Whales for example. They have a single Ancestor. We have been able to prove this fact because of the fact that Whales have Bone in their inner ear, that no other animal has. They gained this special Bone from their Ancestor that evolved it. <br>  <br>  By looking at the fossil Record we are able to figure out the direct lineage of Whales based on this alone. <br>  <br>  Unless you think that somehow it's pure conicidence that this Bone is present in this Animal from millions of years ago, and now it's present in all modern day Whales and no other creatures.<br>  <br>  When you actuallly bother to study the evidence, you realize it's inevitiable that Evolution is real. Creatures adapt to their enviroment because they can not force their enviroment to suit their needs.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Evolution is a fact proven by the fossil record.  There is no question that life has been changing which is the definition of evolution.  Natural selection is the only scientific mechanism that has stood the test of time.  Genetic evidence makes it a certainty that all life including humans are descended from a common source.<br>  <br>  1. The fossil record clearly demonstrates in an unambiguous way that animals have been changing over time.  It clearly shows speciation and evolution.  The dating of rocks is verified by several different methods.  We would have to throw out the book on nuclear physics, chemistry, and geology to deny the ages.<br>  <br>  2.  Some Genetic evidence:  <br>  a.  Humans have a different number of chromosomes than the other great apes but the evidence is very compelling that one of our chromosomes is the result of fusion of two ape chromosomes.  It is beyond difficult to explain the fused chromosome without admitting that humans and apes share a common ancestor. <a href="http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome...</a><br>  <br>  b. Mitochondrial DNA studies have been done on thousands of different species.  There is a section of DNA on the mitochondria that doesn't code for proteins and is free to randomly accumulate mutations.  It is used as a sort of clock to show evolutionary relationships.  When they sequence a few hundred base-pairs as is common, the odds of one of those sequences occurring randomly is one over a number with hundreds of zeros.  The sequences show humans are 91% similar to chimps.  We are less closely related to gorillas.  They are not just randomly different.  They are different in a way that suggests a common ancestor of humans and chimps.  Chimps and humans share many of the differences between themselves and gorillas but have had enough time to accumulate many separate differences.  That pattern is consistent with all other animals.  It is powerful mathematical proof of evolution.   <br>  <br>  c.  Many genes and genetic markers are shared by closely related animals.  Some genes are maintained by virtually all animals but the number of genes that are similar or the same increases as they are more closely related.  That also applies to non-coding regions so the argument that a similar animal will have similar genes isn't really valid.<br>  <br>  3.  The logic in the writings of Darwin was so persuasive and is an easy logical extension on how humans can change the form of domesticated animals by selective breeding.  We see selection work in domesticated animals over the relatively tiny span of time that humans have been domesticating them.    We know the time frames involved and we see how animals, including people, are adapted with regional differences.  If there are persuasive arguments about errors in Darwin's simple logic, I haven't heard them.<br>  <br>  4. We know how the mechanisms that change the chromosomes act on a chemical level and there is no longer any doubt about it.  There are many mechanisms that can eventually lead to new species.|`|50zbKv0jaa	then you haven't looked read Darwin's voyage of the beagle ,its quite simplistic you will be abe to understand it<br>  when you say you look at evolution you look at creationist sites<br>  there is no doubt species become different over ages , there is numerous fossil records and even within our life times , the explanation of this observed fact is evolution,  if it occurs is not under discussion, as it does<br>  <br>  the majority of Christians world wide see no Contradiction between evolution and Christianity. the world's biggest christian denomination accepts evolution. only in the USA does this cess pool of ignorance allows creationism not be laughed at when mentioned.<br>  <br>  Christianity is not challenged by evolution only ignorance
jR8kyp0Taa	Because what we're going through right now is "stagnation". It is inflation in conjunction with a slow economy.<br>  <br>  Inflation problems are likely to arise when the economy is growing too fast...businesses are borrowing more money, which infuses more money into our economy, creating inflation. Usually they solve this problem by the Fed Reserve raising interest rates on the money banks borrow from the Fed Reserve. <br>  <br>  In a slow economy like ours, they can't raise interest rates, because banks are already not lending out money to businesses, and if they raised the Fed interest rates, it would do even more damage to our economy. <br>  <br>  So we have a situation where the interest rate is low, but banks are NOT lending out money anyways, and they can't lower the rate because that would increase inflation, and we can't raise it because that would hurt the credit market even more. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation</a><br>  <br>  Boy Wonder<br>  <br>  See you back in the classical section.|`|F0uLexezaa	where would Obama get the $750 billion from if we couldn't print it?|`|eVYhqaXDaa	1. The mint just makes the coins, not the bills.<br>  2. Bills are a small part of the money supply. They make up M0, or the monetary base. When it comes to inflation, M2 is more important. This is more influenced, but not controlled, by interest rates. <br>  3. Cutting money supply drastically has its own risks. In hyper-inflationary situations, just stopping the presses will go a long way to improving the situation. When you are talking about inflation in the single digits, there are better options.

afcLu9YMaa	To see a building in your dream, represents the self and the body. How high you are in the building indicates a rising level of understanding or awareness. If you are in the lower levels of the building, then it refers to more primal attitudes and/or sexuality. If you are scaling or climbing a building in your dream, then it indicates that you are getting carried away by your ambitions. <br>  <br>  To dream that you or someone fall off a building, suggests that you are descending into the realm of unconscious. You are learning about and acknowledging aspects of your unconscious. Alternatively, it can symbolises your fear of not being able to complete or succeeding in a task.<br>  <br>  To see construction in your dream, signifies a new surge of energy, growth, ambition and renewed confidence. It may also represent the rebuilding of your own life. <br>  <br>  To dream that a building is under construction, suggests that you need to work on some aspect of yourself and better your mind or body. <br>  <br>  Flying dreams fall under a category of dreams known as lucid dreaming. Lucid dreams occur when you become aware that you are dreaming. Many dreamers describe the ability to fly in their dreams as an exhilarating, joyful, and liberating experience.<br>  <br>  Flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your own personal sense of power.<br>  <br>  Falling is an indication of insecurities, instabilities, and anxieties. You are feeling overwhelmed and out of control in some situation in your waking life. When you fall, there is nothing that you can hold on to. You more or less are forced toward this downward motion without any control. This lost of control may parallel a waking situation in your life. <br>  <br>  Falling dreams also often reflect a sense of failure or inferiority in some circumstance or situation. It may be the fear of failing in your job/school, loss of status, or failure in love.<br>  <br>  According to Freudian theory, dreams of falling indicate that you are contemplating giving into a sexual urge or impulse. You maybe lacking indiscretion.<br>  <br>  Falling dreams typically occur during the first stage of sleep. Dreams in this stage are often accompanied by muscle spasms of the arms, legs, and the whole body. These sudden contractions, also known as myclonic jerks. Sometimes when we have these falling dreams, we feel our whole body jerk or twitch and we awaken from this jerk. It is thought that this jerking action is part of an arousal mechanism that allows the sleeper to awaken and become quickly alert and responsive to possible threats in the environment.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are ascending in a lift/cage, suggests that you will quickly rise to status and wealth. You may have risen to a higher level of consciousness and are looking at the world from an elevated viewpoint<br>  <br>  To see a cable in your dream, represents your stamina and durability. If the cable is frayed or broken, then it signifies a lack of strength. <br>  <br>  <br>  To see friends in your dream, signifies aspects of your personality that you have rejected, but are ready to incorporate and acknowledge these rejected aspects of yourself. The relationships you have with those around you are important in learning about yourself. Additionally, this symbol foretells of happy tidings from them and the arrival of good news|`|9EcD7InIaa	You are  trying to not face a problem in your life|`|lhQB3Klzaa	maybe it means that ur friends will be there for u when ur i deep trouble. and speaking about dreams try learning lucid dreaming where u can actually control what happens in ur dream and what u do in it.<br>  <br>  try dreamviews.com/

I do not argue that VAWA is not gender neutral and should include everyone.<br>  <br>  However your assertion that women are the primary abusers needs to be addressed; It doesn't consider the bigger picture. More children are cared for by women than are cared for by men. The overwhelming majority of single-parent families are headed by mothers 84%, rather than fathers (16%) So based on these numbers, of course you will find a greater number of women abusers.<br>  <br>  What you really want to know is whether women or men are more LIKELY to be dangerous when they are caring for children, whether it is women or men who are "more LIKELY" to abuse children. The raw numbers of incidents by themselves don't tell you this.<br>  You'd need a completely different equation to figure that out, but I suspect it would be pretty even.|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	It's a known fact among law enforcement agencies that a huge amount of domestic violence is perpetrated against men by women, but far less is reported as men are too ashamed to admit that women beat them up. Many men are psychologically unable to hit a woman, and whether feminists believe that or not it is quite true. I have never heard of this VAWA act, presumably its American, but the concept is shameful and I quite agree it should be a VAPA act.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	ive only read the title but the answer is yes, being up in arms is what feminists do.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	It must be an American thing but it sounds totally unfair.<br>  <br>  Since when do the femenists get to make laws in the US?

That obviously isn't happening in a chimps mind but I still think they are more intelligent than most people give them credit.  They seem to have much better short term memory where they can remember the placement of objects on a computer screen.  They are probably much smarter than the average person in some ways but not language or logic.

Xxt4pEyEaa	Yes, but discreetly. I use to nurse my children wherever. I gently covered myself with a receiving blanket as to not expose my ta-tas...it can be done.

Be a lady, for God's sakes.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Well that is your opinion, and you are entitled to it. <br>  However, your opinion holds less merit in my eyes that the opinion of a lactating woman.  I don't put it in the same intimacy category as making love, sorry.<br>  A great many women are savvy enough to breastfeed under cover by wearing specially designed clothing or using a blanket on top.<br>  <br>  Besides, if a baby is hungry and crying, isn't it a higher priority to meet the baby's need than to accommodate all the varied preferences of other people ?   <br>  <br>  <br>  Women should be able to breastfeed anywhere, anytime.  It is desirable that they make a reasonable attempt to observe public decency.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, if you are breastfeeding, then you pretty much have to feed the child when it wants to be fed, if you don't then it gets uncomfortable for both the baby and you as well (your breasts get painful and swollen with milk).<br>  <br>  So you are faced with the choice of either feeding the baby when it wants to be fed, listening to it screaming with hunger, or not going out at all. I personally opted for feeding it when it wanted to be fed.  I thought that preferable to spending a year at home without ever leaving the house.<br>  <br>  Really, you know, you don't actually see anything when a woman is feeding a baby, because her tit it stuck in the baby's mouth.  And i am sorry, but it is NOT the same as making love.  You' re not looking at two naked humans writhing about, you are looking at a baby and mother who are both pretty well fully clothed, all you can see is a small portion of the mother's breast, hardly more than you would see if she was wearing a low-cut dress.  So I think your statement that it is like making love is a wild exaggeration. <br>  <br>  Society cannot have it both ways.  They never stop nagging on nowadays about 'breast is best' etc, well they can't do that AND kick up a fuss about women breastfeeding in public.  One or the other.  Not both.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I always did.<br>  If it's done right, you'll barely notice it.<br>  Most people thought I was just cradling him under a blanket..|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Sick, sad culture we live in when a woman can't breastfeed her child without people comparing it to having sex or taking a ****.<br>  <br>  It's not like this in countries where children actually get breastfed.<br>  <br>  What does modesty or discretion have anything to do with it? People have sexualized breasts so much that they are repulsed by the idea of breasts not being sex toys.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  I actually like those crunchy types of mothers who pull out their breast and breastfeed in front of everyone. I know that they are doing it for show and to prove a point, but a lot of people don't get the point yet. Breastfeeding isn't vulgar or disgusting or wrong. It's people that are vulgar and disgusting and wrong.|`|AA11553969	People will get over it and become used to it and it will not be such a big deal.<br>  <br>  When I was in a foreign country 40 years ago, my fellow servicemen and I discussed more than once that we hardly ever saw pregnant women out and about in public in that country.  Yet here in America it was considered normal.<br>  <br>  Since it is not sexually provocative and since the baby would be hungry and crying without it, let the mothers breastfeed and don't inflict your hangups on the rest of us.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	No big deal.   <br>  Just as long as the kids not like 3 years old and still breast-feeding.

I have breastfed in public (very discreetly, a light blanket or shirt isn't that big of a nuisance) more times than I can count and have never once drawn attention to myself or received negative comments.<br>  <br>  Because it is such a natural occurrence, I don't feel the need to make a spectacle of it like I have witnessed some women doing.  They act as if they are doing something so unique that every person in the room should see it  and perhaps give her a standing ovation and then become challenging to anyone who doesn't.   <br>  <br>  I, personally, don't have a problem with seeing an exposed breast for the purpose of feeding a child.  What I do have a problem with is women who turn it into something vulgar by being as obnoxious as possible about it.<br>  It's a natural time to feed and enjoy your child. Why turn that time into something of a debate, a political statement, a battle of wills or an ackward situation.  I don't want to use my child and his/her mealtime as a time to prove a point.<br>  <br>  I guess I'm rambling...<br>  <br>  Sometimes there is no option other than to breastfeed in public but discretion is key (and easy).|`|qEIeJLtGaa	I think that breastfeeding is natural, and wherever it's acceptable to bring babies, it should be acceptable to breastfeed. It so funny that in today's society we'll accept sex and violence everywhere- we watch it for entertainment, we let our kids watch it, they say bi*** on your average sitcom nowadays, people walk around half naked trying to be "sexy"...but if a woman does one of the most natural and nurturing acts on the planet that is considered disgusting.|`|Pl4jVVGYaa	if your baby is hungry I don't have a problem with that, but its when women who just don't give a flying f*** as to where they breastfeed kinda piss me off.<br>  People are not denying a woman's right to breastfeed in public, people just want you to do it as discreetly as possible.|`|EMmGFqgJaa	Like one of the posters said you must be young.

Add to that our quirks and foibles, our quest for improvement and our fallibility; a veritable melting pot of qualities. Celebrate the individual and reap the rewards. If insecure, we have to work on our confidence and self-esteem. We can't afford to beat ourselves up; have confidence in what we can do and be honest about what we can't.

Someone who does not get angry or paranoid easily. a calm person will not get frustrated easily either.|`|w29tsXLUaa	A calm person is at peace with themselves. They have found the secret of keeping calm. They are wise and do not lose it in difficult situations. Because they do not lose it they are able to sit back and survey other people reactions, from this they learn.<br>  <br>  They do not use up energy on things that cannot be changed. They are the philosophers of this world. They use their energy better than people who flit around worrying about this and that.<br>  <br>  I would judge that this state of mind is not God given it is learnt from experience over time.<br>  <br>  The whole crux is that flitting around worrying is a negative vibe whereas to sit and stay calm wins the day.<br>  <br>  People who lose their temper lose the battle. The calm person wins hands down. Keeping calm in a argument will very often win it. Simply because you are able to handle it better and not blinded by negative emotions.|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	Most of the calm people I know are simply oblivious or ignorant to what's going on around them, so they don't get all angry, anxious, upset, ect...over the details.|`|t27SvIPbaa	Someone who thinks and acts, not someone who reacts.|`|0mXQODsIaa	jebus|`|S4VVE0onaa	someone who does not stress out easily and can seem to handle and be in control of their feelings|`|hwlxPXh4aa	Not me XD<br>  <br>  ~Luce x x
DV7wLZLraa	A financial crisis  is a situation when money demand quickly rises relative to money supply. Until a few decades ago, a financial crisis was equivalent to a banking crisis. Today it may also take the form of a currency crisis. Many economists have come up with theories on how a financial crisis develops and how it could be prevented. There is, however, no consensus and financial crises are still a regular phenomenon. A stock market crash is an example of a financial crisis.|`|0hgTGSZbaa	The current global economic/financial was created by top bankers using the banks to achieve their aims.
8d8ejHPfaa	Ew, I can't say as I care for that commercial much.  Most likely it got drilled into your subconscious sometime when you had the tube on in the background, and heard it without really paying attention to it, then your dreams spit it back out to you.  <br>  <br>  Just for giggles though...<br>  It's a "cleansing" imagery with sexual connotations.

AA12360662	First of all, if you have watched any sci fi movie,TV, or read any thing related to that (news, books, magazine), that may lurk into your subconscious mind.  However,<br>  <br>  Dreaming of meteoroid could mean of warning, alerts and things that you may wonder about in life.  In other words, you are feeling the need to explore something in life.  Perhaps, this meteoroid serves the symbol of knowledge seeking.|`|hmsMpECkaa	When you dream, you use all of your brain; your body is shut off.  <br>  What happens is the controlling theme of the present that has come from the input from your senses is the main subject of the dream.  Or, like the guy said, you may have watched something about meteoroids or you were sitting out in the night looking for a meteoroid. But, what is a meteoroid?  That is your label.  Was it a comet or asteroid or meteor?<br>  Anyway, it was probably falling from the sky.  Falling from the heights.  Is there something about to come crashing down or is your idea being cast down?|`|EYqTV2EYaa	It means nothing. You simply had a dream of a meteoroid. You know, dreams are nothing more than 'daydreaming' in the sleep, only you can't control your thoughts in REM sleep. Of course daydreaming doesn't mean anything, right?

ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	Over 300 years ago Shakespeare wrote that there were some cruelties too great for any man to contemplate, only a woman could commit them.<br>  <br>  During the Holocaust, many female camp guards acquired reputations for the most horrendous acts of cruelty, setting dogs on naked prisoners, having tattooed prisoners skinned so that their skin could be turned into lampshades, regularily carrying whips and flogging prisoners for no reason except pure sadism.<br>  <br>  No, the idea of women being the gentler sex is a Victorian misconception. They are often far more violent than men and this seems to be because once set on a particular course of action a woman is far less open to change than a man.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Actually, females are the dominant species.  They have evolved from dominant, yet plain-Jane looking to dominant AND gorgeous-in-every way.|`|mCAWxobNaa	My impression is that in a number of mammalian species, e.g. Felidae, the female is the main hunter while the male stays with the family.  So clearly there is some disparity in how different members of class mammalia handle these sorts of things.<br>  <br>  If that's the case, then there's nothing inherent to the male which make him inherently more violent, therefore I would submit that this portrayal of men as brutes is nothing more than the vilification of men using mortality statistics which factor in the size of the given offending individual.  Violent crimes that don't end in death aren't accounted for.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I'm not sure you are correct.  Many females - bears, lions, etc protect their cubs from the male of the species.  It's the males who fight each other in the rutting season, not the females.<br>  Even in fish - Siamese fighters cannot be kept together, as the males kill the females, unless they are in the breeding season.  My daughter has a chameleon - it cannot be kept with a female, either.<br>  I'm not talking about food or defence.  <br>  Nor do I think that women are passive victims.  They are physically weaker.<br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Not for the squeamish!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZRw0IYdf3g&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZRw0IYdf...</a>
BAlntsndaa	Pretty much the same thing - although a curse is meant to be stronger and longer, a hex is more of a middle range general bad luck and a jinx is a relatively minor shot of something gone wrong. Let's say Sally is cursed: Sally gets sick, her dog dies, her house burns down and she loses her job after her boyfriend runs off with her sister. If Sally were hexed: she would lose her job, the dog would die, the house might burn down but then things even out. Should Sally have been jinxed, she would have lost her job and maybe the next job and had trouble finding a job.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	I'd say curses are the most malicious out of the three. In context of the books for example, Fred and George may jinx someone for a joke or as a way to get back at someone, but they would definitely not throw a curse at someone. Jinxes could be assigned to a person OR an object. (and objects could be charmed or jinxed to do certain things, charmed could mean bad or good).<br>  <br>   Curses usually landed people in St. Mungo's the wizarding hospital. They are also linked to the Death Eaters a lot, the illegal "curses" kind of wrap "curse" up as a dirty word. <br>  <br>  Hexes are kind of middle range malicious spells..but usually didn't permanently harm anyone.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Just different wording for the same thing.
5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Yes.  Follow Christ and his teachings and stick to those.  Unlike his apostles and disciples, Christ never preached that women were to be obedient,etc|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Since feminism is a political belief system, that's like asking if you can be a liberal christian, or a conservative christian. And I think the answer is yes. The LDS church used to routinely excommunicate women for it...but most don't.|`|Jhrkvhgtaa	Part of feminism is hate and hate and christianity do not go together.|`|e7jXVNOJaa	yes probably|`|R2AYKVVlaa	Yes.

After what they did to Sonja Johnson, I don't know why they aren't excommunicating those calling themselves feminsts but maybe the leaders don't know.  The Mormons were really against the ERA and sent busloads of their women to protests. I don't know the whole story there but the mormon feminists housewives came to mind when you mentioned that.

What about a woman who truly hates men or a who man truly hates women is normal? I've met a lot more non-feminists who hated men after a divorce than women who call themselves feminists.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	I agree. In fact, most man haters are feminists. And then the more moderate feminists do not call them out or distance themselves from these man-haters, they simply turn a blind eye to it... and then they wonder why their women's movement is compared to a bowel movement.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	She'd probably call herself a feminist, but because feminism and misandry are incompatible by definition, it wouldn't be accurate.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	Neither, it's time people (particularly legitimate feminists) stopped letting man haters be counted in feminisms number. Stop allowing these people to hide behind a curtain of nobility and call them what they are - misandrists/man haters!|`|x5MYW2LPaa	Neither.

IOK8qUBjaa	I've been married for over a decade and love is an obsession. To suggest otherwise is to ignore all the crazy, selfless acts, an otherwise sane person will do in the name of love. For the record I'm not talking about unhealthy behavior like staying in an abusive relationship.<br>  <br>  No, I'm talking about becoming a person who loves someone other than self and enjoys it.  In nature it is common for animals to do whatever works or pleasures that animal at that time. With some animals in the wild or with humans (we're animals too) we find that we're capable of sacrifices that are not strictly for our own edification but of others. Providing those sacrifices to our family, children, friends and spouses becomes a willful obsession.<br>  <br>  My cousin always wanted a kid, when she got pregnant she ended up with just us, her family for support. One horrible night she went into a diabetic seizure while driving her car. She hit a tree and was taken to the emergency room where labor was induced while she was in a coma. <br>  <br>  My cousin was unconscious the entire time, however she so wanted her son to live that she waited for him to be born before she died on the table. The doctor said that right after the baby was born she let go. Her obsession with her son, his safety and allowing him to be born was an incredible sacrifice and an act of love.<br>  <br>  Her son is seven now and he is very amused at how much we all obsess over him. We love him because he's family and we are thankful that his mother entrusted him to us. <br>  <br>  I'm sharing this information because far too often we don't acknowledge the great depths of compassion Human beings are capable of and this interesting question was a good opportunity to do just that.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Well if you are in love with someone, hopefully that feeling is reciprocated, if it's not requited and the other person clearly shows you they don't want to even be your friend.. then even if it's painful, if you love them, you would let them go and move on, even if your heart would feel bruised and you would feel like crying.. if a person tells you they are not in love with you and wish you to stop talking to them and you go on following them around, watching them from afar, staring, stalking them so to speak... and don't take ''No'' for an answer'' that would be obsession.. an obsessive lover is a person who will stalk the other person.. phone this person against their will, send emails, leave messages on their cell phone or text them, wait for them...watch them. Sometimes that will be all they do but it's very annoying to the person who gets harrassed like that and clearly doesn't want it.. who doesn't give a hoot about the obsessed person.. and feels probably angry or scared for being pursued...as a woman more likely scared and someone really obessed with someone can turn into a real stalker and even be a dangerous person, going as far as thinking ''If I can't have you, then nobody can. A normal person who falls in love and if the love is not returned, will accept that, may cry for some weeks and feel down and depressed but will get over this and be able to move on and say to themselves. '' She or he doesn't want me in their life, I can do better than run after someone who wants nothing to do with me. I have some self respect. Out there is someone who has feelings for me.. I am going to look until I find a compatible person who returns my feelings and shows me respect and love and trust in return...'' that's what a not obessed and normal thinking person would do if let down.. and the love not returned.. if the love is returned there is no need to feel obessed as one has won the other persons heart.. that still means one should leave them also some time to do what they want and not ask them to spend every moment together. because everyone needs some ''alone time or to hang out with some other pals.. without cheating.. guys may want to hang out with guy friends and girls may want to go out with their female friends.. and the couple spend quality time together.. and know that there is mutual respect and trust and honesty..  so there is no need to worry... the love is mutual so one has to trust each other..<br>  <br>  Obsessive love can also happen toward a celebrity.. like in the sad case of Rebecca Schaeffer.. this guy was love struck by her.. he was obsessed.. he liked the way she looked and fell in love with the person he saw on screen.. he stalked her.. and he was so obsessed that sending her messages and phoning her was not enough..  he stalked her to death and ever since then.. the laws of stalking someone have changed.. because that was a big shock that a fan would go that far... kill for obsessive love with a celeb..<br>  <a href="http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/shaeffer/shaeffer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shortta...</a><br>  <br>  Real love is given without a reason.. it asks for nothing in return.. but of course real love for someone hopes that the love will be returned... if not, it hurts, but someone who loves and is let down, will let the other person go and not follow them if they know they are not wanted around.. They will get over the hurt of rejection with time and find someone who gives them the respect and love they want and deserve.|`|c3h3qgNpaa	in love is a deep feeling of like<br>  and care for da person or thing <br>  and an obsession is just wanting sumthing bad <br>  i guess

One is that both Mexico and Canada have resources the USA lacks.  The other is that the costs of production are lower (due to  lower wage structures).  Comparative advantage is also another factor.<br>  <br>  Further consider that when the USA has an appreciating currency, which has recently occurred, it causes imported products to become more attractive to consumers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|lWqOTYvWaa	Primarily it is because the U.S. is the big monster economy of the three nations. The U.S. economy represents about 85% of the total North American economy. So a great deal of economic activity in both Canada and Mexico is organized specifically to cater to the U.S. market. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, almost nobody in the U.S. is compelled to develop an export business to Canada or Mexico ... there is just no point when the domestic economy is so much bigger.<br>  <br>  Add in the fact that wages are lower in both Canada and Mexico, and transportation costs to the U.S. are low, then U.S. companies have good reason to locate plants in in Canada and Mexico to make goods for export into the U.S. Hence many cars for the U.S. market are made in Canada and Mexico, for example.<br>  <br>  Then on top of that, by an accident of geology, both Canada and Mexico have been major sources of oil and oil exporters, while the U.S. next door is the #1 oil importer in the world; and so naturally the U.S. imports much oil from both.
0G0UFJleaa	Have you suffered any loss of a family member? If so, you could be replaying the grief, loss, and guilt you're going through. If that's they case, you need to talk to a professional. Keeping a journal will help you sort out your feelings. If you've not lost anyone, you're anxious about a sudden change in your life. You have fears and issue about a change that is coming or you're worried is coming. Are you someone in your family going away to college, joining the military, getting married, moving, started a new job, etc.? There's something in your life that causing you stress and anxiety.

To see death, hurt, pain or loss in a dream points out that  you are thinking that death will come to you. This fear of death is stored in your sub-conscious mind and when you are asleep, this fear is transmitted in your conscious mind and you see these dreams. Please do not think like this.

AA10438590	I have begun having dreams like this in the last few years, very realistic. Dreams one and three seem to be very good dreams because in both cases you were challenged and then rewarded with success, once in your education and once in your personal life. I think you had those dreams to comfort yourself, to remind yourself that you are capable. You had these dreams to reinforce the good feeling that you will feel everytime you work hard and open up to people you care about.<br>  Dream number two sounds like it might be deja vu.<br>  The wikipedia definition of deja vu is:<br>  "Deja Vu...is the experience of feeling sure that one has witnessed or experienced (or dreamt) a new situation previously (an individual feels as though an event has already happened or has happened in the near past), although the exact circumstances of the previous encounter are uncertain. The term was coined by a French psychic researcher, émile Boirac (1851–1917) in his book "L'Avenir des sciences psychiques" ("The Future of Psychic Sciences"), which expanded upon an essay he wrote while an undergraduate. The experience of déjà vu is usually accompanied by a compelling sense of familiarity, and also a sense of "eeriness," "strangeness," or "weirdness," The "previous" experience is most frequently attributed to real life, although in some cases there is a firm sense that the experience "genuinely happened" in the past." <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Ed6oxtUTaa	Can you dream about me?

AA11530601	when I was a kid my mum used to buy me Barbies but I just wasnt interested in them. It might be because i am bisexual but i just never played with dolls, I was like "they dont do anything!!" and I preffered insects, dragons and sometimes, transformers.       I think some people are born naturally inclined to masculinity or femininity but not all are - to be honest, after doing my degree, its pretty clear that its not nature or nurture alone, its how these two interact to form the final product. There are societies where women go hunting and ones where they never hunt-so clearly a lot of out definitions of gender have to do with society. But society is so strong, that i think its effects can override biology in some case.|`|of049X1waa	Well, the idea of what a woman should do varies from culture to culture, so parts of it we learn.  However things like mothering and taking care of a baby are natural.  If you believe in evolution, it is because of the instinct to take care of the baby so it will survive and pass on your genes.  If you don't believe in it... well, it is because of some other reason then... lol|`|5a702ac9cd8917468655f3a78ac465f9aa	Women are basically different from men. Emotionally, physically and mentally.

What society does is organize these instincts and give them direction.|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	I think it is a bit of a mix really. For example I think feminine dressing, or a girl owning dolls is something you learn from society. A child acting like a mother and taking care of her dolls is probably a mix between the natural and society - usually children copy so caring for a baby doll may just be copying adults they have seen or doing what the children in the adverts for the dolls do, but it may be slightly down to instinct since in many other animals it is the female that looks after the child (I am kind of guessing here). But other feminine things, for example the way we walk, talk or sit that is slightly different from men is probably just nature.|`|ulsIrphnaa	its actually how u were raised believe it or not like gurls still act upon emotions but still for an example a gurl is raised around a bunch or guys and yeah lot of testosterone so most likely if she will be more Masculine than ur avg gurl  see what i mean? it can go both ways its not 1 in particular necessarily|`|6jSxYrZnaa	"There are natural instincts that predispose women to certain behaviors.

That is exactly what we see.|`|2bO7iiZdaa	I think it varies. Many women don't do those things, many men do.|`|PwvU3LQBaa	I guess for me, it didn't come as a natural instinct.  When my little brother was a baby I tried to push him off of the couch.  I didn't feel the want to nurture and care for him, I didn't like him.  I am a year older than him so I wasn't more than a baby myself.  I didn't want to take care of him, I didn't want him near me.  I didn't like dolls either and wanted to play with G.I. Joe and He-Man toys.  I liked to play outside and get dirty and fight with my brother.  I was, and still am, a tom-boy.  I still never picked up the "feminine" traits.  I act like a guy most times and I am 100% heterosexual.  I just don't feel the need to want to dress up and do the girly things so many other woman like to do.

Most economists agree that we are two ages beyond that which means that manufacturing jobs should have been obsolete here about 50 years ago. The only reason they still exist is that the meddling government has halted progress by creating incentives for manufacturers in order to prevent "unemployment".

B9EifWApaa	I believe that therapists are judgmental on the inside in most cases. Think about it, even though they're trained professionals, they're human - even THEY could use therapists of their own when they have stress in their lives. Sadly, it is human nature to judge, so they're likely making assumptions before the whole story is even told to them. At least they're hiding it to help suffering people finally become happy and get through their problems.|`|4676ab82fdec587e35a8084755696854aa	I think it depends on the therapist. Whether or not someone is judgmental depends on their personality. I'd imagine psychology as an occupation attracts fewer judgmental people, but there are still going to be some judgmental therapists. You can't say across the board "yes" or "no" because it's always an individual thing.<br>  <br>  Edit: Though no one is ALWAYS non-judgmental (I think) there are many people who are virtually non-judgmental. Some people are always judgmental. It all depends on the person.|`|6fpjnCMCaa	I believe that that depends on your personality and the type of person you are.|`|KeBhVux6aa	Well I think some are like that. But for the majority of therapists, they really are nice, loving, and caring people. You have to have at least some heart about you to be able to put up with people's problems all day, and then come home and have to worry about your own as well.<br>  <br>  I know that being a therapist is an emotionally stressful job, so I think a lot of therapists can be tired whenever talking with a client, and feel required to put on a fake smile instead of their usual, jolly face. But like I said before, the majority aren't required to be so caring....they just naturally are.<br>  <br>  Also, as far as being judge mental goes....I don't think the majority of therapists are, either. When entering the world of psychology, it's very important to enter it with an open, understanding mind. There are so many mental disorders, emotional experiences, and the like that a person can have. Any good therapist should know that with every client that walks into their office, there's bound to be a story for each one. So if a therapist is judge mental, then that's not a very skilled therapist.<br>  <br>  If you're having trouble trusting a therapist, then I suggest finding a new one---one that will actually care about you, or one that you can confide in more easily.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|HqahkvLeaa	Therapists need to see Therapists....<br>  <br>  They Ask you how you feel about something and then ask you how you feel about the way you feel about something and then why you feel this way about something and then how you feel about that.....<br>  <br>  They are actually very judgemental....because deep down beneath that inquisitive scary therapist is a person and EVERYBODY has an opinion about something...Its natural....
e2DEQ6Euaa	I find the term pro-life interesting. Aren't vegetables and plants alive too? By eating a fruit and disposing the seeds in your trash, haven't you laid waste to an entire chain of potential trees? And no.. I'm not just saying this to be annoying. I really mean it. Yes, we probably could slaughter animals in a less painful way and I entirely support your cause in that aspect. However, switching to purely vegetables isn't as righteous as some might have you think.|`|nM2k6geEaa	That size of an animal, there are not many other ways to get the job done.

There should be a better way for those who chose to eat meat. Unfortunately it is all about money, this is the cheapest way to do the "job". People need to be aware of what condition , how it was slaughtered, etc... the meat they are about to eat. This is the key, people need to be aware and do something about it. Either donate money, time etc...

XYQAxq6Iaa	As long as it's established that you both have no intentions of romance behind civility, it's more than appropriate.

He probably didnt even think twice about it and by you speaking to him tells him it didnt upset you that much either.

I wish I had enough money to actually make some sort of impact directly; one of my favorite scenes in "Pretty Woman" is when Julia Roberts' character goes back to the first hoity toity "boutique" and shoves it down their throat, I would love to be able to boycott all the stores that don't carry my size or other people's sizes, which is MOST stores (I have to shop in the children's section at WalMart) AND you can only get well-made, warm work clothes for women at specialty stores, a lot more expensive. Wal Mart and such do not carry them, even their thermal underwear for girls and women is so thin you may as well not be wearing any. As far as purchasing power, like I said, not enough money to make an impact. But stamps are only 40 cents and emails are free :)|`|oO4TUkVkaa	They do but the people of the world have spoken and said they do not want to buy a product associated with a fat old ugly girl.

vTs0oeKKaa	Morals and values are both -essentially- the very same ideal. Both of them are completely reliant on self-beliefs and those things that we've individually deemed - for whichever reasons - to be right or wrong to us.Morals and values are self-imposed beliefs and if comprised of the right reasoning they're both of a great importance toward decency and fairness to all living beings.|`|kiihLiLvaa	Moral is usually a lesson for other people. I mean if u do that or u act like that u will have some consequences. For example, we always say that Be friends with whom you don't like", "Don't judge people by the way they look, If u hurt other people; u will be never happy etc. and the Value are something symbolic who represent people, countries or a nation. For example, we think that justice, equality and liberty r must for human.
2GNFQPdmaa	Well, mining is a dirty business and metals have to be mined to make our high technology. Plastics are oil products, and oil drilling can be dirty too. <br>  <br>  Fluorescent lights have mercury in them, batteries are full of nasty things.<br>  <br>  All production has an adverse effect on the environment in one way or another, and with the growth of technology comes the growth of productivity and therefore more production. <br>  <br>  The real story, though, is how technology can help us clean up. Did you know that the societies with the most advanced technology are also the cleanest?<br>  <br>  Older, obsolete methods create a lot more pollution than new methods. We invented ways for car engines to run smoothly on unleaded gas, and we got a lot of the lead pollution out of the atmosphere and the water. We have been making car emissions cleaner and cleaner for a hundred years. In fact, that's why MPG doesn't go up very fast: engineers have been trying and trying just to get the same performance out of cleaner engines, and they've been succeeding.<br>  <br>  EPA restrictions have gotten more and more severe over the years and only new technology helps us meet them. <br>  <br>  High technology may not be as clean as living in the woods and having as little impact on the environment as you can, but it's a lot cleaner than old fashioned heavy industry.

If you are only meeting people in places where appearance is the initial attractor, then the clingy ones are going to block you off from any more independent types. <br>  <br>  Do you have a work or hobby-related activity group you could use to link up with like-minded women who are there for their own reasons? <br>  <br>  Or, I never thought I'd suggest this, but the supermarket is actually a good place to meet people who have their lives together. Shopping after work lets you meet employed individuals, and the contents of their shopping trolley or basket (basket, preferably, as it indicates single status) can give you a topic of conversation. <br>  <br>  You will almost certainly meet a reasonable woman eventually.

I remember awhile back reading some dating advice that suggested thinking about your image as your storefront window.  You need to ask yourself, how are you advertising what you have to offer?  How are you getting the attention of the people you want to get attention from?  Of course, you raise a very good question- what do you do when it seems like no matter what, your window is advertising the wrong thing?   <br>  <br>  Truth is, dating is just harder for some of us, for any number of reasons.  Maybe you should be thinking about situations where you can meet people in an environment where they'll get some time to know you better and see who you really are?  Are there any hobbies you can get involved with?  Maybe something that will showcase who you are inside and let that outshine your appearance, perhaps some type of art class or drama group?  I know you don't want to hear "it will eventually work out," but isn't it possible that your situation simply will require more patience than someone who's lucky enough to have a personality that fits the initial impression their appearance gives off?|`|V1MptCMiaa	Maybe you should go see a therapist about your confidence.  Women tend to like guys with broad shoulders, it's kind of a symbol of protection.  Guys with wimpy shoulders couldn't save us from sh*t.  And there's nothing wrong with a woman who wants to be dominated sexually and you shouldn't feel bad giving them what they want.  And about your hair, there are plenty of girls out there who LOVE bald men.  Stop feeling sorry for yourself.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I have to admit that I'm not sure you're going to get anything new and helpful . . . you've asked this question so many times.<br>  <br>  What about online dating?

This way, you won't have girls pre-judging you on looks alone.<br>  <br>  That's the best I can do?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry it wasn't to your liking.  But seriously . . . I'm kind of out of answers.  Did you ever pursue that other avenue I recommended, of trying dating in the queer women's community?<br>  <br>  Also, I don't think there's anything wrong with pointing out how many times you've asked this.  There's a graph I have in my head that charts the effectiveness of asking multiple times over time.  It keeps going up and then finally drops down, because after a while, the asker has finally annoyed everybody by being so persistent, and everybody has offered up their opinions.  So . . .yeah.

jDFEo7tWaa	The only valuables I have in my life are friends, and I keep those in my heart. Nothing is really worth keeping, and if you do, you risk losing it in fires or even home invasion robberies.    If you're gonna keep these things safe, nothing will work unless it's something that can't be taken out of the home. Like, a safe screwed into the ground or wall tightly enough that no one can take it out unless they spend hours trying, in which case I hope someone has found them and done something about it before they succeed.    To me, the best places are out in the open. If you're gonna have stuff stored anywhere, it best be something that you can only use for a season (like winter stuff). Otherwise it's not worth having in your home. Take away the clutter and you need not worry about keeping it "safe".     If you have an area that no one would really think of looking in, that might be the best place. But I would get a great alarm system and make sure there are no points of entry in the home that are open while you're not home.  If you do that, you'll be able to showcase your valuables. If you don't feel that someone can be trusted, stop allowing them in your home. This will save you a lot of trouble.    Most robberies don't happen randomly. They won't go into your home if you have nothing of value.|`|FumERLamaa	i keep them stored away in a plastic box  anything like pics,cards and letters r in a a4 wallet|`|C0yagFFoaa	in a fire proof safe. they are quite cheap to buy and las t foreve|`|AA10135847	Safes are good investments for our homes. Before making a purchase, ask yourself the following questions and weigh your answers carefully:    1. How many items do I need to keep in a safe? Banks provide safes that you can lease to store small pieces of jewelry or a few documents. Safes from the stores are available in different sizes. Choose a safe that can meet your requirements but is also not too small in case you want to store more items in the future.    2. Do I need a fireproof safe? Safes made of fireproof material are more costly than the ordinary safe but provide greater protection to your valuables.    3. Where will I hide my safe? Plan an excellent place to situate your safe. The safe should be properly hidden but should also be accessible to the owner. Wall safes are designed to be hidden beneath paintings. Safes can also be installed by attaching them to the floor.    4. Do I want a safe with keys or a safe with a combination lock? Which type would be more convenient? Remember that codes have to be memorized and keys kept secure.    5. How much budget do I have for my safe? Always consider price versus durability and quality and purchase the most useful one that fits your budget.    Fireproof safes provide good storage for items with sentimental and/or monetary value. You can choose to store these items in the bank but having fireproof safes in the convenience of your home provides you an easier access to your belongings. Check if the safe is fire resistant or fireproof. These terms are not the same. Fireproof ratings are computed by how much heat the safe can withstand for a certain period of time. Consider your requirements before choosing one paticular safe over the other.|`|Er4le3okaa	In a box in my closet:)|`|CIzrjrykaa	in a shoebox under my bed :)

Few know what it means to be a man these days.|`|K4zsztkRaa	The biggest one is my parents can circumcise me and take away a very important part of my body as well as 40% of my sensitivity with it without asking my permission and people think that's okay, while females are protected under the law. Female circumcision is illegal while male isn't. That's the biggest.<br>  I mean why don't I get to have the same human rights as a woman?<br>  <br>  I don't feel like women are trying to take revenge altho I mean being treated like crap for thousands of years does deserve something in return for putting up with it.<br>  <br>  Being an activist and trying to ban non medical male infant circumcision I have heard a lot of what women have to say on the topic. Many women are mature enough to realize that when you love someone all is the same. But a lot of women get pretty nasty and say that the way men where born is ugly and not worthy of anything sexual untill a procedure greatly effecting our pleasure is done. They make horrible comments about how dirty we are if we aren't and yet they have a vagina which is about 100 times harder to clean. Ihave heard a lotof nasty sexist comments made.<br>  <br>  Also just because I'm a teenage male, I have to pay more auto insurance than a female. I mean what's more sexist than that? It's perfectly okay to charge teenage drivers more but not charge more based on gender. I don't care what statistics show because you can probably get a statistic to show that black people are better drivers than whites and should get a discount, but people would flip if that happend yet I'm charged more than females. I'm a great driver yet I pay more just because of some stupid study.<br>  <br>  Men also are raped all the time, yet so many people out there think it's impossible. It's not at all. A man can be raped by a guy or a girl. But men don't usually tell when something like that happens because they are looked down on if a woman raped them. Also if a male teacher has sex with a 13 year old girl he goes to jail for pretty much life, but if a female teacher has sex with her 15 year olds male student people think he's cool, or the female teacher gets A LOT less time than the male teacher. Guys are victims when it comes to the sexual harrasment court system. some guys really get what they deserve but I've never seen a women get treated as harshly for the same exact crime.<br>  <br>  Also if I was straight and married and I punched my wife I would probably go to jail. But if she were to punch me I'm not sure anyone would do anything about it.<br>  <br>  Also I'm sick and tired of the attitude a lot of women have these days. "Anything you can do I can do better". I mean if there is a difference between a woman and a man, the woman is automaticaly the right one. Like it's always men are too horny, never women aren't horny enough. It's men are too selfish, and never women just make too many decisions based on their emotions. It's always men are too dirty and never women are just too clean. I mean every time you turn arounds the man is always the wrong one.<br>  <br>  Now I understand it's not all women and only some, but I do feel that men are being looked down upon by women. I mean if we are sapposed to be equal then why do so many women treat us like lying, cheating, bastards who only care about sex?<br>  Of course I'm over exaggerating there to get my point across but a lot of women see men as the stupider, lower sex. They think they are better just because they show more emotion.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|E2xG6bpnaa	I was thrown in jail for a crime I didn't commit and then back in jail for trying to do the right thing the wrong way.

AA12360662	Basically, insecurity, fear, lack of support will make dreams in general frightening.  Things you project at night may become fear if you have bad experience, are having insecurity in reality.  Personalities can also play important part of this as well.<br>  <br>  As far as dreams being unreal, they are only real if your subconscious mind choose to.  Normally, when you fall into subconscious stage which you can't control your dream.  Those dreams may be vivid in your head.

Actually--this is kinda funny--but my pupils are always dilated more so than a normal person's so sometimes I get asked if I'm high. But I don't act high. The point I'm trying to make is that it could just be how you are and you might just have to accept that. My pupils being dilated isn't harmful, but its different. perhaps you are just different too.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, perhaps your body is overproducing the chemical  dopamine. You should tell your doctor of these experiences. You might also be receiving an extra boost of chemicals from your environment unknowingly.|`|nANyAvzgaa	Know thyself and be yourself!|`|xhSsby6Taa	maybe you're going thru puberty
AA11155064	Most people experience this to varying degrees; some are just better at overcoming it.<br>  <br>  This behaviour is a primordial body language response to a situation that is not consciously initiated by the sufferer but may be consciously overcome once they are aware of it.<br>  <br>  To make, hold and continue eye contact is a sub-conscious indicator of interest, focus, intent and engagement in the moment. To be able to readily do so indicates ease, comfort and confidence in the association of the moment.<br>  To be unable to do so -- whilst maybe wanting to -- indicates discomfort,insecurity, a desire to break the connection of the moment and disengage in order to relocate to a more comforting zone.<br>  <br>  Often the eye-line breaking discomfiture comes from a feeling of being unequal to the "demands" -- physically or emotionally -- of the moment. Mostly embarrassment or guilt (or embarrassment guilt which is a self feeding cycle) are responsible for this feeling.Like most phobias, the fear of inadequacy is generally without basis and only of importance to the sufferer -- not anyone else.<br>  <br>  Overcoming the fear of inadequacy and extended engagement lays in two main solutions. First: be prepared as much as one foresee-ably may for the occasion. This will instill confidence with attendant comfort. <br>  Next: assess the importance of the situation/social engagement. We often build up situations beyond their worth. If it is not immediately life threatening does it really matter? By reducing the accorded importance, we reduce tension levels, reduce the fright/fight/flight impetous that wants us "OUTA-THERE-NOW". With deminished expectations the situation is more readily met, experienced and even (initially minimally perhaps) enjoyed.<br>  <br>  Don't worry of others perceptions of your affliction. Not all "eye-lockers" are confident, prepared or guilt free. This can be a learned behaviour.<br>  Not all "eye droppers" are insecure, tense or guilty. They can simply have other priorities.<br>  <br>  The key is to destress yourself Try it and comfort shall ensue.|`|VDTTzwlUaa	Just make yourself do it. Many people see this as rude and can become a problem later on.|`|vijGOcPCaa	I know how you feel, and let me tell you it is partly we are shy, but it go's deeper then that. It is partly our society, it is considered odd or uncomfortable to look people in the eye. It is a tad to personal, it's like you feel as though they are looking into your brain. I know how you feel, when i look at a beautiful girl or she looks at me, it is so hard to look them in the eye, because we are not confident, we get so nervous and we don't want to get that personal, because really that is what looking at someone in the eye is doing, its making you more personal and invested in the conversation.|`|JbGbU6guaa	If someone didn't bring this up i would have.thank you. i have this same problem and it is very discouraging. i try my best to look people in the eye, but i just can't just bring myself to do it. sometimes i find(strangely enough) that people have a hard time looking me in the eye.<br>  must be shyness on my part or theirs.|`|hCRxXDFgaa	Maybe you have a hard time with attention in general, and afraid of what happens when people actually notice you the way that you notice them|`|nM2k6geEaa	you may lack sincerity, real honest interest in the person you are with<br>  Check out the different colors or same colors in your different friends.<br>  Don't look at their boobs.|`|AA10478052	It's not that there is something wrong with you.. It's more of less social experience...Let me further this explanation, see there are different people in this world, there are the plain, the sly, the "lifted people", and the hateful. You seem as though you are part of the "plain". This means that, yes you have a social life and do have confidence but when confronted by a figure that has power your confidence feels as though it's high but your body language will not match it. This probably usually happens when you're with someone who either tries to make you look stupid a lot and have too much ego and too many lies or you are in contact with a person who you are simply not comfortable to comprehend. For example, the girl situation could be that you do not wish to splurge emotion because it could comprise confidence.<br>  <br>  <br>  In short, you're normal but you've not experienced many social emotional confrontation making you not want to embarrass yourself.|`|do4c3O3paa	I think you are just shy around certain people.

hCJzZ5rnaa	We are all in the same boat, we may take comfort in that.<br>  <br>  If you fear death, suicide merely brings it nearer.<br>  <br>  Do not worry, live and lead a good life, and do not fear death, what comes next will be even better than the good life you have here on Earth!|`|3r252UIRaa	You're only 16 (I'm 16 too) you don't need to worry about getting old for a long time. Yes, your current body is impermanent, because all things in Samsara (worldly existence) are impermanent. You can't be happy if you're constantly thinking about the future or dwelling in the past. If you try to live in the present moment, you will be happier. <br>  And as far as death goes, when you die you will be reborn. Reincarnation is a fact. So if you want to come back, you can as many times as you want. As for me, I'd rather attain liberation and attain the everlasting bliss of Nirvana. But if you want to keep coming back to this world lifetime after lifetime you can! But life has alot of suffering. Nirvana is everlasting bliss and freedom from suffering.|`|M4PMGw2Zaa	Yes, life does seem to be going fast. I'm three years younger than you but please don't say that my opinions don't matter. Everyone has a fear but your fear shouldn't consume you. I don't think you're necessarily depressed...just scared. You shouldn't give up your life, though. It's the only one you'll have. It's JUST death. Everything happens for a reason...if you died, there has to be some greater cause out there. Something more important than you could imagine. Sounds optimistic but it's good explanation, right? So just live your life and try not to think about death. Obsess (sorry, can't think of another term) over something else and then choose something else again and again until the thought of death is gone? It's the only thing I can think of. I can't help at all with the independence thing but I do know that you'll adjust. Just try to go with the flow, I guess. If your parents raised you well enough, you should know what you can and can not do. Yes, everyone gets worried. You never know when your life will end. Don't worry; it's not just you.

Therefore she must stay away from the kitchen during food preparation and religious ceremonies    2) Sexually undesirable and inaccessible.

Walking faster or uphill made me huff and puff. So I became more sluggish with everything else I did - and that included my work. (It even took me longer to finish my tasks!)  I spent more of my time in front of the TV and less outdoors or doing things around my home.   Because of this I became more and more dissatisfied with myself and my life.  The last straw was:(Typical female)  Shopping for new clothes took me twice as long before I found something that looked good on me.    So I took charge of my life again and lost weight.

For example, if you make a tasteless joke, about Mexican-American's and farm work in a large social setting; you are not going to get laughs. You very well may be ostracized. If you make a joke about a fat (obese) person being an over-eating slob, it is hilarious. Hell, in America we make movies ridiculing obese people.    When you are obese, you are invisible. People do not look you in the eye the same way that they would if you were thin. Professional colleagues, in most instances, do not take you as seriously.     Physically, you are more exhausted. An obese person is carrying 100+ pounds of excess body weight, which can cause a whole host of problems including but not limited to osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, p.c.o.s, pseudo tumor cerebri, etc.     The National Institute of Health has said that less than 4% of obese persons are able to lose weight needed to come into a "normal" body mass index range, with only 2% maintaining that weight over 5 years, using diet and movement in traditional methods.     That means, if you have over 100 pounds to lose, you probably cannot without surgical intervention. Most obese people are not out eating at McDonalds breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There are genuine hormonal imbalances that affect one's metabolism. Other things than can affect a persons weight over a lifetime include trauma, stress, abuse, neglect, physiological imbalances, and genetics.|`|Egq3Art3aa	The REAL question here is how do their beliefs about themselves effect their body? If they constantly berate themselves for being overweight and hate their bodies, then they will never loose that weight. Subconsciously, weight can act as many things, such as a protector from a variety of issues. Many people gain weight stemming from a dislike of themselves. I could go on, but that should get the point across...    Unfortunately, a vicious cycle is created. For most people, even if they appear happy, they put themselves down and think negatively about their weight. And the only way to truly loose that weight is to start accepting and loving your body AS IT IS, which is often difficult.   For example,When we go on a strict diet, what are we telling our bodies? -that it is not good enough! And THAT is the real reason why fad diets don't work!

It depends on your own values, your culture, etc. When something is immoral, it means that that thing violates a person's value sytem. Immoality, like truth, is relative. This means it is different for every person. <br>  <br>  However, by the list you made, I'd say that you believe immorality and truth are absolute. Something is wrong because it is wrong and if someone else has a different view then they are immoral. I'm not trying to say who is right or wrong here--everyone has a different way of thinking. <br>  <br>  What I think your teacher is expecting you to address is why the south thought it was immoral of the north to deny them the right to break off from the nation. You see, the civil war was not about slavery. The emancipation of the slaves was just a by=product of the war. What president lincoln wanted to preserve was the unity of the united states. He wanted to save the union from falling apart. What drove the southerners to attempt to leave the union in the first place was the fact that Lincoln was elected. It enraged them becuse they did not trust him because he was a republican and the southerners had had a bad expeience with rebublicans in the past. <br>  <br>  You need to explain why the north found leaving the union wrong and why the south felt it was not. The south thought it was their choice, part of their own freedom. Also, you should address the issue of slavery, but do not make it the main issue. Show that you know why the civil war really happened. Explain that the south depended on slaves because they were mainly agricultural and that north was industrial and may not have understood the need for extra labor. Also elaborate by saying the south's dependancy on its slaves was the reason they felt freeing them was immoral. It would hurt them. Plus their culture had had slaves for so long it was difficult for people to break out of their socirty's norms.|`|izTOuLz5aa	Well that depends. Immorality can be stealing, fornication, and other "serious" sins. It would be wise to look in the bible and what is conisdered "immoral" vs. moral.

You are feeling helpless,  you are feeling very passive. You are waiting for him to make the first move, and in reality, that is how you feel that he is not doing anything at all.  <br>  <br>  2.  There may be some guilt conscience in you, so you created the scenario with this guy, but doing nothing.

I don't do it very much either.  Just once in a while, when I'm trying hard not to cry.  I'm as girly as they come...married mother of 2.  So take it how you want to.  However, I do enjoy playing video games so I guess I'm not that girly either.  By the way, my husband gets mad when I cry if we're arguing.  So sometimes I have to try my hardest not to cry and that's the best way.  Stop bashing people who do it and grow up.  It's actually a very old fashioned method.
AA11307468	It's the typical double standard.  Single men are bachelors and single women are old maids.  Who cares?  I've always felt that people can call me whatever they like.  The terms people use usually are more reflective of the people using them than the people they are used to describe.|`|YQOT68xFaa	"Old maid" is not a very nice way to talk about a woman. Yes, it's a stereotype and not a flattering one either. I have a good friend who is in her 50s and never married. She is sweet, kind, generous.... she sure doesn't fit the description of an "old maid". Actually....neither do the other single older ladies I know. There are some women out there who are single and aging and are miserable about it, but there are also plenty who are okay with it. That's the trouble with stereotypes - they just aren't a one-size-fits-all deal.    PS, it isn't that older single ladies "were productive to our society" - they still *are* productive. Productivity doesn't have to hinge on youth and marital status. They have just as much to add to their community as any married person.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I don't think it's sexist, I just think it's stupid.  We have to be careful of what we label as 'sexist'.  It was a term that was appropriate for its time.    Back then, if a woman wasn't married by 18, she was considered an 'old maid', or a spinster.  Then, because women were not educated in anything beyond singing, cooking, and knitting, they often ended up alone, or as a burden to their parents.  Is it any wonder they were bitter?    Nowadays, women have no excuse to be uneducated or reliant on others for their basic needs.|`|o2FJIXS9aa	I never even hear the term any more. I am amazed when I find a woman HAS NOT been married. I don't think it's because she didn't get asked or ask someone, I just think she had a different life plan. As someone who's been married too many times, I think I wish I could have turned out "an old maid" rather than a divorcee.|`|AA11530601	yeah its a little sexist but id let it slide....wouldnt bother me that much....it does imply what you say, that is a negative to be old and unmarried, but ppl would use it without meaning much harm, although when it was 1st coined (over 100 yrs ago) such attitudes were much stronger, nowadays someone might well use it without holding such strong views.

Old maids that i know aren't at all bitter towards men and aren't att all that as you've described above, except of course for the age.|`|q8NheXZqaa	Using the term "old maid" says more about the person saying it than the intended target of such an antiquated label. The "old maids" I know have great lives, as long as they have a paycheck and a vibrator.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	I don't know anyone who uses the term so don't stir up trouble where this is none.    The term "spinster" or "old maid" almost fell completely out of common use after the sexual revolution of the 1960s, being replaced by the coinage "bachelorette" or "single girl." However, both of these terms were scorned by feminists as being denigrating in their own way, the first as a diminutive of a male status, and the second for minimizing their dignity as adult women, not "girls."  After 40 years the feminists have finally decided that it is ok for us to refer to them as "single woman" or "unmarried woman".|`|iRKOJhYeaa	I would say its outdated rather than sexist. At one time it actually meant something, and there was a real stigma attached to it. But these days, it means nothing at all.|`|uhchod38aa	You know, it wasn't too long ago that if an unmarried woman bought a house, they wrote "spinster" on the paperwork.     The words themselves simply mean an older woman who has never been married. They do carry a social stigma. An old maid was to be pitied. In this day and age, it's an outdated term.

They are hypocritical ..they can be fat but want skinny women....and if men have money they can be as fat and old as they want to be and women will fall for it.

NP6ES2GPaa	All the poster have been somewhat right so far.    The money is borrowed by the Federal government from private citizens (through gov. bonds), financial corporations and other countries. The loan is made on the good credit of the US government with the promise that it will eventually be paid back by the US taxpayer.     Meanwhile the owed money piles up in a figure we call the "National Debt".|`|2aI0UmhWaa	----Even as the U.S. Congress looks for ways to expand President Barack Obama's $819 billion stimulus package, the rest of the world is wondering how Washington will pay for it all.    Few people attending the World Economic Forum question the need to revive America's economy, the world's largest, with a package that could reach $1 trillion over two years. But the long-term fallout from increased borrowing by the U.S. government, and its potential to drive up inflation and interest rates around the world, seems to be getting more attention here than in Washington.    "The U.S. needs to show some proof they have a plan to get out of the fiscal problem," said Ernesto Zedillo, the former Mexican president who helped steer his country through a financial crisis in 1994. "We, as developing countries, need to know we won't be crowded out of the capital markets, which is already happening."    Zedillo said that Washington, unlike most other countries, had the option of simply printing more money, because the dollar was a reserve currency for the rest of the world.-------    the conclusion because the U.S. doesnt have that much money on its own, (i think) borrowes from other countries, such as european countries ( where i was born, in europe yea!) like spain, greece and britian.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	They just print more of it in the press.|`|oojO4WAraa	That money comes from the taxes you and I will be paying for the rest of our lives.

It sounds brilliant especially since introversion is a major problem that kids with inapt social skills face. You could use the book Psychological Types by Carl Jung as a major guide, it studies introversion and extraversion. Just go to the loner in your class and talk, make a friend along the way.

2GNFQPdmaa	First, Biodiversity means having a lot of different life forms. Obviously.<br>  <br>  Let's talk about biodiversity, agriculture, and the Irish Potato Famine<br>  <br>  In Ireland in the 1840s a disease called potato blight was destroying the potato crops, creating a lot of hardship in Ireland.<br>  <br>  In the US we learn about it because it caused a big wave of Irish immigration.<br>  <br>  The reason that potato blight caused so much trouble was a lack of biodiversity in the irish crops. If the irish had been growing more different types of crops, the famine would not have been as bad.<br>  <br>  Here's what I mean: say you have 10 fields, and you plant all 10 with potatoes, and potato blight kills all of them. Now you have no food.<br>  <br>  But say you planted 2 with potatoes, 2 with carrots, 2 with wheat, 2 with corn, and 2 with onions. Now, even if the blight gets all of your potatoes, you still have a lot of food. Biodiversity saved you from a disease that targeted only one kind of crop.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
nQOaKiueaa	Since you've already made a lot of progress with your studies, I suggest you continue studying and finish your studies.  Once you finished you can do other stuff. Stuff that you love, like the ones you've mentioned above.  You have to at least finish what you've already started rather than start from zero.  The choice is still up to you no matter what I say, but I think all your hard work will be put into waste if you stop now.    Hopefully you won't feel depressed about this any longer. =)|`|vY5HUrQPaa	Maybe you can finish your Master's then use counseling related to cooking, nature, sports, and christmas suggestions.     o Cooking: Give advice about ingredients and health benefits to use with certain recipes  o Nature: Counsel about ideal sites to visit where you've been, and the right seasons.  o Sports: Provide support to young people in the type of sport you like  o Christmas: Advise about products to buy according to need, practicality, etc.    Even if these ideas don't interest you, don't quit. Finish your degree and maybe try studying something else as a backup. I thought I wanted to be an artist, and graduated with a BFA, with a Spanish minor. Never got anywhere; I wasn't skillful enough. I escaped my misery by calling out to God to help me, and He began telling me about His plans for my life. It's all about a relationship with Jesus Christ. Not religion.    It turns out that my destiny is to fulfill God's purpose: to promote and become like Him in character. But I discovered that my creativity and language abilities can still be used in this purpose.|`|JbKerMCkaa	I think you should major in what you want to do, not what other people tell you or only if it makes sense. I ended up changing my major 3 times during undergrad.  I was told the only degree worth anything was and Engineering degree, so I went after it....and hated it!  So I switched to Business and though I enjoy leadership and business, I had a hard time with some of the core courses...just couldn't grasp it and wasn't happy-- so then I switched to Communication and loved it.  My parents were pissed and didn't understand....but it all worked out great once I graduated.     As I get to know myself more, there are other things I wished I would have tried in school and other paths I would have taken-- I would encourage you to talk to your councilor and parents about it and make the change now at 22 rather than wait until you are starting your professional career.  You like sports, so what about Counceling in sports or something with psychology in that field....there are many options out there I think!
