20090222104745AAAtJli	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I have a school assignment to write a satire. Should I do this?	Okay here's idea:    Make fun of all stories about people with superpowers (Harry Potter, Push, True Talents, the Watchmen, just to name a few) How it could work: A group of teenagers fall down a laundry chute into another parallel dimension in the basement, where a magical toy lion asks them a series of questions, and if they get it right they will be given powers. Turns out the powers are absolutely useless (ability to raise temperature of air 2 degrees, ability to make things turn sparkly, ability to turn small lizards pink, or something like that) and when the whole world hears a booming voice giving this prophecy "Okay, it's like in all the books y'all read. People with magic powers need to save the world" characters think it refers to them.   and then they realize that the entire thing was what they imagined when they were drugged out in a mental hospital because they are all schizophrenics.       Stupid, yes, satirical of fantasy genre, maybe. What else could I make fun of in writing? We can satirize anything we want...

20090222103157AAOpaPA	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Need some help and comment...?	For a school writing project and the prof instructed that we write fantasy - not my strongest point so I am a wee bit worried.      To attain a mystical artifact of fortune and wealth, heads of several families must collect several objects. And to do this, they must organize a group of people that the artifact granted powers to specifically be in this secret war.  Some of these people join because of personal profit or because they are afraid - to attain the artifact, all but one group must remain alive. So if they don't have a group, they'll have to fend for themselves.       The people who have powers have restrictions because the artifact fears that no one might win. And those who ignores the restriction must pay a costly price.      Here are some of the powers:       Angela: she can freeze any liquid but only when she is in contact with her twin. She can surpass the restriction but for every droplet of liquid that she freezes, a droplet of her own blood will disappear.       No name yet: He can create illusions that can fool the senses but only if he is in contact with his twin (Angela). He can surpass the restriction but everytime he uses illusion to fool the senses, his own senses will start to detriorate. Such as when he creates an  auditory illusion, his ears will start to go bad.      Allan: He has the ability to memorize countless information but only if it is written in red ink and on paper. He can surpass the restriction but he loses a memory for each word that he memorize.      So the restrictions ranges from silly to just dangerous. What do you think? Prof is really harsh so this need to be good. Is the plot okay?

My face was pushed up against my Aunt Cath y’s car.                   No one said a word.                   Leigh, my usually very silent little sister stayed silent, as usual. And Halley, my older sister stayed quiet as well. I just sat, doing what I do best. Observing.                   “Girls, we should be there soon.” The four of us were squished inside my godmother’s car, next to the majority of the things Leigh, Halley and I owned.

It is about the current economy and how the world will fare after the recession (big topic, right :) I have read many books, academic publications, newspapers, magazine articles, etc, but am struggling how to put all the helpful information together. I have always admired authors who can cite extensively and skillfully in their works. For example, the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Gibbon or Manias, Panics, and Crashes by Kindleberger.       So my question is: how do you document/organize/use references when you work on a relatively long academic publication? Any thoughts and tips are highly appreciated. Thank you!

20090222121413AA10Da6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Analyzing Imagery in Poems?	Please explain to me how would you be able to answer these questions because I've been trying to find out what the poem is trying to say and i can't! I have to answer these questions in two paragraphs each. Please and Thank You! :)   - What image does this poem contain? Look at each line and discuss the different senses the author uses such as sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch.   - How is the first half of the poem different from the last half? And what is the poem ultimately about and how is the reader supposed to feel about this topic?      Living in Sin   By: Adrienne Rich      She had thought the studio would keep itself;   no dust upon the furniture of love.   Half heresy, to wish the taps less vocal,   the panes relieved of grime. A plate of pears,   a piano with a Persian shawl, a cat   stalking the picturesque amusing mouse   had risen at his urging.   Not that at five each separate stair would writhe   under the milkman's tramp; that morning light   so coldly would delineate the scraps   of last night's cheese and three sepulchral bottles;   that on the kitchen shelf among the saucers   a pair of beetle-eyes would fix her own---   envoy from some village in the moldings . . .   Meanwhile, he, with a yawn,   sounded a dozen notes upon the keyboard,   declared it out of tune, shrugged at the mirror,   rubbed at his beard, went out for cigarettes;   while she, jeered by the minor demons,   pulled back the sheets and made the bed and found   a towel to dust the table-top,   and let the coffee-pot boil over on the stove.   By evening she was back in love again,   though not so wholly but throughout the night   she woke sometimes to feel the daylight coming   like a relentless milkman up the stairs.

20090222165844AAPsmTy	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Insights please on these statements (philosophy)?	1.) Love is an activity of giving, the disinterested giving of self to the other whereby i enhance other's unique value and in doing so enrich my own. Thus, love of the other as other does not run counter to self-love but presupposes it.      2.) Freedom. As man gradually unfolds in the world, is not only free, he becomes free and "response-able". Freedom then develops into self-possession w/in an objectively directed project of life."      3.) Justice is the minimum demand of love rooted in the invoilability of the human person.      4.) Man as a being-towards-death, and in death man comes to grip w/ his wholeness and brings to completion the commitment of his whole self to the whole of reality.      these are statements in philosophy..please share with me your insights on these statements.

20090222161856AAkvb5f	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would this be considered plagiarism? ...?	i read a fanfiction online, told from a cynical and rude author's point of view. in one of the chapters, he meets an old lady on a train who is reading one of his books, and he claims he is not the author of the book when she tells him she's a fan, but she doesn't believe him, and he gets all mad. i want to write a short story, and i wasn't even thinking about this fanfiction when i came up with my concept of two strangers meeting on a train, but then i got the idea to make one of them an author. my story is, a woman is on a train reading a book that she finds very inspirational and beautiful, and she starts talking to the woman sitting across from her about the book. they have a conversation about all sorts of things (while the similar concept in the fanfiction i read was very terse and only a tiny part of the story) and then at the end, after the other woman leaves, the woman reading looks in the back of the book and sees that she has been talking to the author the whole time. do you think that using my concept for a short story competition would be plagiarism? are the ideas too similar?

And i wud tell u wat its about but i dont want anyone to take my idea/ im not quite sure all wats goin to happen haha.   but anyway my question is:   so far wud this mak u want to keep reading and do u hav any suggestions and do u think its good at all.      Prologue      It was an average spring day when he came.  The wind blew grass into the air, and the birds chirped calmly as if nothing was wrong.  But something was wrong, he was coming and once he crossed there would be no going back.  There would be no life behind him.  I sat in the big oak tree and watched the grass sway in between the railroad tracks, waiting.  Sure, I could have warned him, warned him not to cross.  But it wouldn’t have helped.  It was destiny for him to come.  It was destiny for us to meet.  And it was destiny for him to be trapped.  And like in any other situation, destiny always had a way of working out.                                       Chapter 1                                ~Tanner~        I had been living on this ranch with my brothers for 6 years now.  And for the first time since we moved here, I was bored.  Truly, bored.  I walked down the stairs into the kitchen where my two older brothers, Brady and Garrett, were sitting.  I watched in disgust as Garrett stuffed his face with bacon and eggs.  I  glanced around the kitchen for any food leftover from their early breakfast before work.   “Thanks for leaving me some food, guys.” I said sarcastically, walking over to the fridge.       THANKS!

I'm 15 going on 16. My brother is already there in hollywood trying to become big not there yet but still going for it. My parents say that it is to much money. Especially because of this recession and because they already spent, and still are spending, lots and lots of money on him. So because of that they don't want to me to go. Another reason is my brother has been there fo 3 years now but hasn't landed a role yet. So because of that they think that I won't be able to get a role either. It's been my dream since i was little and it still is. I know i have what it needs to get big and do good there. But i don't know if i should just follow my parents "directions" or follow my dreams. and if so can you guys tell me if you had the same problem and what happened.

Dust floating down   like empty promises   or broken dreams      The Model steps    behind the screen   strips  shivers   silently waits…      Turpentine fumes,   charcoal dust   greet her as she   approaches a low platform.      She is posed and reposed   never making voluntary movements,   repositioned, a breathing sack of life,   herself never seen -   only masses and planes,   shadows and lines.      The class ends,   artists smoke in the hall,   she walks slowly past easels    to find her clothes,   shocked     at her complexity   portrayed in two dimensions.

I'm trying to get back into acting at the age of 18 after a 5 year hiatus. My old agent deals with principle work and that is all I've ever done previously. However, I'm a bit rusty as I haven't acted at all since I stopped 5 years ago. I was thinking it might be a good idea for me to start with extra work rather than jumping right into commercials with principle roles. I've never done extra work before, but it might boost my confidence before I start auditioning for commercials and movies again. What do you think? And, I think if I wanted to do this I'd need to get a new agent who deals with extra work. I know of one that my friend goes to so it would be easy to get in.

Please do not be against it just because it is "emo."      I slip, I fall,   Another bruise is left on my knee.   I crawl towards you   Bleeding still.      Scarred and tortured,   The pain comes out,   Tears shed,   My heart is cut.      With that razor,   I fight to say no.   I wonder if the battle   Is already lost.      Giving up is just so easy to do.   Say goodbye,   Kiss you one last time,   The end could be so soon.

20090222113106AA2UQOV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Searching for the title of a children's book?	There was a fairytale book I used to love when I was younger, and for the life of me, I can't remember the title.       The plot follows as thus: A princess lives in a fairytale world, with wizards and (I'm fairly sure there are dragons, goblins, the like). As she's visiting her wizard friend, she falls through a mirror (or pool of water, or such) and she ends up in the real world. Completely disoriented, she gets picked up by this makeshift family of two high-school students and an older character. They have her go to school with them, and she and the boy that found her start to fall in love, but this other, rather nasty character at the school also wants her. The two boys fight, and I forget who wins, but I'm fairly sure the boy who loves her does and he ends up going back to her world with her. There's a particularly important detail in the book, something about a blue rose, but that's all I remember about the story.       Does anyone recognize this story and if you do, do you know the title? It used to be one of my favorites. (and yes I know, this seems VERY similar to the movie Enchanted, it's not lol)

In the ocean the silence    moves and moves    and so much is unnecessary!          Patient, he drifts    until the moment comes    to cast his    skeletal blossom.          The fish in the stone    knows to fail is    to do the living    a favor.          He knows why the ant    engineers a gangster's    funeral, garish    and perfectly amber.    He knows why the scientist    in secret delight    strokes the fern's    voluptuous braille.       can anyone give me a small explication of this wonderful poem.

I can't remember the title or author, but it's about a group of kid's, four of them, and they had strange powers and lived in a house together. I don't remember much, but the main girl was an artist, and her love interest was someone named Gale, or Gabriel or something. I think it's about two girls and two guys and they develop a web of telepathy or something. The only parts I remember are when they're in a van and there's a donkey in the road, and a part about where the girl is in some kind of tank for a while, and a part where Gabe/Gale gives himself cigarette burns so that the pain lets him telepathically reach one of the girls. And there's a part where the artsy girl gets hooked up to a machine and gets suction cups attached to her that have some kind of small dark crystal in them. That's all I can remember.

Now she has to go on a three day road trip with him because they are going to the same college and that was her only source of transportation to get there. So she decides to just get over him, but it seems that her ex boyfriend isnt quite over her.      Thats more or less what the back said ... PLEASE help me if you know the book!

20090222185621AAaHA7a	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Make it big in show business?	Alright, I'm 15 years old and I've known exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life since I was 7. I want to act. I don't want to do any musical or broadway kind of stuff, I want to do film and play big roles and be known. How do I make that happen though? I don't know where to start AT ALL. Should I write e-mails to actors, directors, or acting agencies? I'd like to do this as soon as possible, or before I graduate. The reason being, I don't want to go to a fine arts college. That just wouldn't be the place for me, since it's preparing me for a career that's not guaranteeing anything. Please help in any which way you can. I'll appreciate it. Add me on myspace if you'd like to conversate more: myspace.com/57345266

20090222191818AA5XEvJ	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	I want to be a professional musician?	My life-long dream is to be a professional singer. I'm sixteen years old. I've been playing the piano for ten years, the violin 7 years then switched to viola in september. And I've been playing the guitar for a few years now, I'm not really sure how long. I love to sing. Many people have told me I have a great voice. This past May I performed a song in my school's singer songwriter showcase thing. I want to go to California and have a record deal and travel around the world performing. However, I don't know how to start. I don't have any money. My parents don't either. They promised me guitar lessons but we couldn't afford it. I had to stop taking piano lessons because we couldn't afford it. At the moment, my parents are borrowing what little money I have all the time, so I no longer have much. I can't pay for a studio-session, or a voice teacher, or manager, or whatever. What are some ways I can get myself out there and get discovered? And please, no harsh comments.
20090222191830AA8VD8J	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Is just anyone allowed to audition for television / movie parts?	I remember I saw a documentary about someone and they had to wait to get like an actor card or something before they could officially audition for things. I never knew this. I know that it can be difficult to get an audition for something prestigious, but do you have to apply officially to be an actor? For instance, if I went to say New York City right now and wanted to audition for a television show, would they let me?      (I'm not planning on auditioning for anything, I was just wondering)
