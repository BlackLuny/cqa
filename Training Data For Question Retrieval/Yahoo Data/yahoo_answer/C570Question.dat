That we’d do good after I was eighteen ..  I’m going to work for 2 years for atleast 30,000 dollars to move there with him. . But after I told my grandmother. . [ I can’t lie. ] She told me she’d have him put in jail for luring me to move in with him. . [ that’s not the case, we had decided if we both feel the same when I’m 18, I’ll go there at my own will.  But, we like playing games like fly for fun, world of warcraft. . And other mmorpgs together until then. ] Would a foster parent understand all this?

20081018011443AAebIEN	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why is it bad/unhealthy to lose more than a few pounds per week?	I have just begun a very rigorous diet and exercise routine.  I lost 2-3 pounds in one day alone.  I don't think it is unreasonable that I will be able to lose 10-12 pounds per week in the beginning (diminishing as I begin losing more weight).  I am not obese by any means (6'2", 200 lbs), I just want to lose some belly fat quickly and continue building muscle once I have a flatter stomach.  My workout routine is 6 days a week, twice a day (first for lifting, and going back later for cardio).  I am not starving myself, but ONLY eating salads (1-2 bowls a day so far) and drinking post-workout protein shakes.      Everyone says it's important to lose weight slowly and steadily, but I have yet to see a detailed explanation about the negative impacts of losing weight more rapidly...  If someone could provide these reasons, I may reconsider my routine.  If you can't convince me otherwise, just wish me luck!  Thanks!

Okay, for the past I'd say two weeks, I've been waking up every night a little before or after 3 in the morning.  I would not be able to go back to sleep for a hour or so at first, and would get up and get a snack (I'm at college in a dorm) and would eventually fall asleep again.  Now, I have been waking up around the same  time and still getting something to eat, but now I cannot fall back asleep. I toss and turn for hours before i eventually get up at around 8 or so.  I then have class all day and have to drag through the day.  Night before last, I woke up at around 2:40 and could not get back to sleep and stayed up all day and went to bed at 8:30 that night only to wake up at 3:20 (today) something in the morning.  I am not sure if this is because my body is conditioned to wake up at this time and get something to eat or what.  Any help?  Its 10:35, I've been awake since the stated time earlier (3:20) and don't know if I could break this by staying up until three, THEN going to sleep.

We took our two dogs to the groomer yesterday and they used a different flea treatment than they used to. Both dogs were fine when we picked them up from the groomer, but within an hour or so, both were constantly scratching and seemed to be "out of it". The one dog wouldn't come out of his cage for ANYTHING. The other dog was drooling and vomiting along with having muscle spasms and pawing at his mouth. All of these symptoms are signs of poisoning. So...we called the vet.      The vet said to bath both dogs in Dawn Dish Soap and to give them both Benadryl. We bathed them and after bathing the one dog twice, he started acting fine. The other dog, however, didn't.       So after a couple hours, we finally decided to call our vet back and take the one dog in for an emergency appointment. The vet gave him 2 shots in the rear (I believe one was an anti-inflammatory and the other was along the lines of Valium?) and another shot in a vein.      Anyways...he told us to monitor both dogs and call him back today.       DOG A = fine but a little withdrawn...has stayed in his house most of the day with the exception of coming out to eat a little.      DOG B (the one we took to the vet) = Still shaky. Still having spasms. Can't lay down for long. It's obvious that he's VERY VERY tired as he didn't get much sleep last night (he was whining all night). I feel so bad for him.      The vet says all we can do really is keep an eye on him/them and that he's already given him the dosage of medicine that he's allowed to have.       I feel so bad for these dogs and I don't know what else to do.      Thank you, Frontline, for making my dogs absolutely MISERABLE.      Can anyone help?

I felt like early today the start of a cold but I never get nosebleeds with a cold.  I do get frequent sinus infections, but this does not yet feel like another infection.  But to be safe I did a sinus rinse and everything was fine until a small-medium sized piece of phlegm came out that was half to mostly all red.  Everything else in the rinse was normal.  Should I be concerned?  When should I visit a doctor, or avoid one if possible, since unfortunately I am without insurance and have very little money.  Thanks        God bless.

I really don't want to go out living like this, and i really do not know what to do.  I havent spoken to my father (have attempted reaching out) for years, my brother and mother constantly put me down (maybe because I look like my father?).

20090309223243AA4IwOp	Health;Other - Health	How can I break my addiction to caffeine? It's REALLY bad...?	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SHORT VERSION:      I'm 15, i drink A LOT of energy drinks, and im addicted to caffeine. in 2008 I had over 16 gallons of Monster energy drinks. i tried to quit, and didn't have any caffeine for 2 weeks. I had withdrawals, and they were really bad.      I was ALWAYS tired no matter what time it was, but i couldn't sleep at night despite the fact that i was tired, i had random, severe depression for no reason whatsoever, headaches that hurt more than anything I could have ever imagined (even 3 ibuprofen didn't help at all), I was randomly nauseous (2-3 times a day every day), I couldn't focus on even the simplest tasks, and even if i could focus on something, i had no motivation to do it.      how can i quit caffeine without feeling withdrawal symptoms? How long will it take?      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DETAILED VERSION:      I know this is really bad, because my doctor told me it's the worst caffeine addiction he has seen it his 45 years of being a doctor, and the other yahoo answers questions only described headaches.      I'm 15 years old. I drink A LOT of Monster energy drinks. I keep the little tabs from the top of the can whenever i have one and put it in this box in my room (one box for each year). i recently counted them all up from 2008, and here's what i drank from 1-1-08 to 12-31-08:      68 regular cans (16 fl oz)   28 XXL cans (24 fl oz)   9 BFC cans (32 fl oz)   1 Hitman shot (3 fl oz)      thats a little over 16 gallons.      I want to quit, because i know it's horrible for me, and it's SUCH a waste of money, but i tried, and i had the WORST withdrawal symptoms in the world. I didn't have even a sip of Monster, or any caffeine (not even headache pills with caffeine) for two weeks (ending today, I had a BFC today), and those were the hardest weeks of my life.      Here are some of the symptoms I had:      I was ALWAYS tired no matter what time it was, but i couldn't sleep at night despite the fact that i was tired, i had random, severe depression for no reason whatsoever, headaches that hurt more than anything I could have ever imagined (even 3 ibuprofen didn't help at all), I was randomly nauseous (2-3 times a day every day), I couldn't focus on even the simplest tasks, and even if i could focus on something, i had no motivation to do it.      Those went on over 2 weeks with no signs of slowing down at all. Today I had a BFC, and i was in the best mood i've been in for about 2 weeks. I need to quit caffeine, this is really bad.      How long will it take to get through the withdrawals?      How can I get through withdrawals feeling as little symptoms as possible?

(I posted this question earlier but I think it ended up in the heart disease category so I wanted to rewrite this) but I am taking a CPR and First Aid class in college right now and we are required to take a partner's blood pressure (and vice versa).  The teacher will be coming around and watching/grading us and she specifically stated to use the left arm.  I DO NOT want to go into this for personal reasons, but I have very (3+ years) old scars on the undersides of my rist that are lighter than my normal skin and raised. I usually wear a watch or braceletes but the teacher is requiring the partner to take the person's pulse on the wrist before taking the blood pressure so to cut this short- I need an excuse as to why I need to use my right arm to get my blood pressure taken so I can just keep my bracelets on.  I DO NOT WANT TO SAY "for personal reasons I don't want to" because i will get flushed and I feel it will draw even more attention to me.  I'm am looking for excuses that seem reasonable considering this lady is a health educator and I don't want her to offer to take a look at my 'sore' arm.  I'm just looking for suggestions that won't draw attention to me since I'm sure blood pressure can be taken on the other arm just fine. The best excuse I can think of is simply that I fell or slept on my arm wrong and it's bothering me (so obviously I don't want a BP cuff constricting it!)

20090309223001AAZolPq	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Painful foot joint, what's wrong with it?	A few years ago, the joint on the side of my right big toe started slanting to the right. The toe is on an angle (my left one stayed the same - it isn't just natural growing patterns) and the other toes are on a slight angle because of it. If I walk for too long, the joint begins to ache - sometimes so much that it's painful to walk. The pain has died down a bit since it started, but is still well and truly there.      A podiatrist I saw could not feel anything out of place, like fluids or a broken bone or anything. He found the joint was definitely more restricted in movement than the left joint is, and the back of my right ankle curves slightly outwards. X-rays showed absolutely nothing.      I never bumped or hurt the joint, I'm not a sporty person, and I'm not diabetic (apparently that's a connection with foot issues?). Orthodics help, but only slightly.      Thankyou so much for any answers

I have been bipolar for 7 years. I went from doctor to doctor, from medicine to medicine, nothing worked. I lost all my jobs and I had real bad depression phases, suicidal behavior and other scarry things I cannot put up with anymore. Luckily, I started taking Lithium last year and things got so well, now I feel good in my mind and life. Unfortunately, I feel like hell in my body. I started having acne, my hair was falling out, my weight was climbing up and I have aches all over all the time. I know lithium has many side effects and newer meds are available, but I can't afford these. So I need to know from those living on Lithium and those who have experienced it, what is your best advise? Should I drop it? Should I stick to it, hoping that it will all get better someday? How do I live with so much change in my physical health?Is there something I can do to alleviate the weight gain and acne and hair loss...?

When I get home from work, I feel tired and stressed.  Since there is only a limited number of hours before I have to go to sleep, I don't have time to do anything "fun."  I just eat dinner, study, and get ready for bed.  However, to relax myself, I turn on the TV in my room and put on the "sleep" function and basically fall asleep to it.  My bf feels that I should not watch TV before going to bed as that disrupts my sleep.  I have a lot of trouble sleeping as it is and I find it easier to sleep with the TV on because it distracts my mind and prevents me from thinking and worrying about everything on my mind.  Is there anything wrong with falling asleep to the TV?

20090309222115AAN8J0w	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Could alcohol have done this?	On Saturday, I went to a friends house to hang out with my girlfriend (they are greatly acquainted) and we were just kinda sitting there for a while. My friend, the one who lived in that house, likes to drink. We are all 13 or around that age. So, she gave me pepsi with Canadian whiskey in it. I knew it was in there, and I wanted to try it, and my gf said she would do things if I finished it. So after I drank it all (very slowly) I began to feel kinda spacy, or "tipsy" more to describe it accurately. So after that my gf sat on me and I was rubbing her belly for a while, and at the end of the visit she ended up giving me a BJ. She was sober, but the other one was, I think, actually drunk. Anyway, after that day, at night I feel like I just want to lay down and sleep, and I get a small headache. Up until now, I have felt just fine, but now, I'm not feeling so great.

I have had braces for about two months or so, but nothing such as a bracket, or anything, is broken. It doesn't hurt at all, it's just quite annoying. I was at the dentist about two months ago, as you'd assume, and nothing was wrong, other than crooked teeth, Heh. I noticed today that when I tilt my head to the left a little after holding my head straight for a while, I hear the clicking noise, only once. It's not my neck popping or anything like that. I called the dentist, and they were no help at all, they said if it was not causing me any pain I could wait until my next appointment. No other information. If anything, what could this be? It's never happened before to me. I can't seem to find any information elsewhere about this either, I tried google-ing it, no luck. When I did find something it would say "TMJ". I don't have TMJ, unless my braces could cause TMJ? I'm not so sure that's possible, anyways if anybody knows anything, feel free to ease my mind! Thanks!

So, I went in, got weighed,  height, eye check,and then blood pressure before the doctor came in. And, I don't know why,but, I was like, really really scared,    i could feel my heart beating. And, during blood pressure, the nurse is like, let me go get a new cuff, and so, I am like, ok.   And she brings one back, and my blood pressure thing was the same. And, she's all like, are you scared and all this. But, yea, so then the doctor comes in, and starts asking my mom questions, such as, is she a picky eater, does she do good i school and all that.   And apperantly he could tell I was scared and asked me if i was, and I did'nt even answer, like, i could'nt. I was super scared, and I just wanted to simply say, kinda, but I could'nt.   after the questions, we did part of the examintation, then heart beat.   And when we came to heartbeat, he basically said the same thing as the nurse.   So, now to the question,   1. I have had this same doctor since I was 2 or 3, and am not scared of the doctor himself.he is really nice and alll. (I have never freaked out like this b4)   2. I was'nt get shots that day, so i was'nt scared bout that.   Okay, so, i am sick, and prob have to go the doc 2morrow, or later this week.   I'm not scared now, but am scared I will freak out when I get there again.   Why do I do that when I get there?   And is there anything I can do to not do that.   ha, sorry it was long, but, yea, lol

20090309171902AAzdL1U	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Question about back pain?	I have had minor back pain since Nov. 07 when i was in an accident, now the pain is unbearable.  It is a sharp pain in my lower back, sometimes the pain shoots down my right leg to my foot when I walk or try  to move my leg, other times when bending over, i will get stuck, the pain prevents me from moving at all, like I am paralyzed. I believe the pain may be caused by a broken disk that is rubbing against my spine . I am 9 weeks pregnant; however I think the pregnancy has little to do with the pain since it has progressively worsen over the years. does anyone have any information on what this is? and how can it be treated? I wont be able to see a doctor for at lest 2 weeks, how can I dull the pain in till then, and would a broken disk be visible in an x ray? ( i had an x ray after the accident and the doctor didn't mention a broken disk) I am only 22, I am terrified I wont be able to walk by my 40th birthday, I am also concerned the pain will put me on bed rest after I gain weight in a few months, or complicate the pregnancy.     Thank you in advance.

20080402181831AA9YfSK	Health;Dental	Brushing after meals?	Ok, I am a habitual snacker and Im in college, so when its late at night and I need something to eat, I generally have to get a snack.  I recently had some cavitites filled and was told by my dentists its ideally best to brush as soon as possible after brushing.  But I have looked on websites that have said otherwise.  For example, after eating anything, (snickers, rice krispy treats ect) I will bursh my teeth to get it off my teeth right away.  But when I actually eat for lunch and get something that has sugar in it with the meal, I'll still brush my teeth as soon as I get back to my dorm room.  Is this bad because of the sugar and me brushing right away causes more damage to the enamel?

He doesn't have medical insurance, but he has been feeling rather poorly the past few days. He complains of stomach pains, which he dubs, "Gut issues." He has also experienced some chest pains, but he cannot find the words to describe it. My guess is that he feels a tightening? Last week he had a significant amount of blood in his poop for a few days. It stopped for a day or so and today he had some (not nearly as much as before). He hasn't wanted to leave the house or do anything at all and says he feels drained, but not sleepy... and I don't know what to do to help him. He's only 24 and in pretty decent shape (6'1", 175lbs)... he shouldn't be having all of these issues yet! I told him that we should go to the walk-in clinic, but we really don't have the money. Any idea what it could be? I appreciate any input.

Is this true? Because I've gotten into an arguement with my parents about money issue and hoping that the ortho isn't ripping me off.

I've asked him to see a psychologist because I know he's not ok but he cant right now.

He says he doesnt trust her and cant tell her his problems. I hate her guts naturally and she hates mine and its like we are half a girlfriend each, her on the physical side and me on the emotional one. I know I'm harming myself too but I still have the hopes that he'll be back with me if I help him because I believe he did everything out of confusion and if this is fixed then he'll be back with me.

I don't know what to do about this, I was told to wear this boot for my foot. But the day I broke it was when I was given a temporary cast to wear until I got a real cast or a boot, they also gave me crutches. Now I have the boot & I walk on it but not all the way. The right side of my right foot broke so I walk kinda normal. I've been hearing from my friends that I shouldn't walk on it so much because it won't heal right. I was told by 3 doctors different things. A DOCTOR said I can't walk on it, B DOCTOR said that I can walk on it but don't walk on it if it hurts but if I put enough pressure on it,I might mess it up & have to get surgery then C DOCTOR said that I may walk on it if I can & if it doesn't hurt. Who do I listen to??? I really don't know if it's healing right or what. I go back to see the doctor in 2 weeks. What should I do about my problem? Do I still walk with the crutches or forget them & walk like I have been doing? What I don't get, Why was I given a boot when I'm being told it's not going to heal right, If I don't use the crutches.

20090309214308AA2GfLG	Health;Dental	Question About My Root Canal?!?	OK. I'm not sure of the process...but once upon a night at 2 am, i forked out disturbing amounts of money to pay for an emergency dentist.      He said he can clean it out (and later get canal), or get root canal then and there. I had work the next day so he did a clean out - he took the nerve out, applied antiseptic and sealed it up with a temporary filling. Since then, it hasn't hurt unless i put pressure on it (then it would sear with pain).   Now, about 1.5/2 weeks later its feeling like it did before the treatment...but what is there left to do? If he took the nerve out, why is it hurting? What is there left to do??

I'm struggling to catch up in school again (my psychiatric disorders just keep getting in the way!), and I'm going through some periods of 2 or 3 days at a time without sleeping. I've always had these violent dreams that aren't nightmares, but that are really revealing in psychotherapy; but it's been a dry spell of late (last four months or so...) It seems that every time I don't sleep for a couple days, though, I do dream- revealing dreams too but that are usually nightmares.I don't really mind them, but I want to know whether they're reliable. It seems that not sleeping triggers these, and since other psychological "triggers" like this are usually sketchy (I'm thinking of hypnosis in particular), I'd like to know whether these dreams are still "real"      And btw, does anyone know why not sleeping would trigger nightmares?

By that time I didn't have the energy to swim up and my body started forcing me to breathe water to just try and get something in my lungs.  I just stood at the bottom of the pool staring up at the surface knowing if i don't get out soon, it's over. My friend finally pulled me out cuz she said she noticed i wasn't swimming back up and got me to the side of the pool to cough up the water. My question is, since then I cough a lot like after laughing etc, could i possibly have lung damage and to what extent??? 10 points to most detailed answer to explain my dilemma. note: this was almost 10 years ago.

20090309203436AANm0he	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Removing a metal plate from my arm?	I broke my forearm about in 2004 & had a metal plate implanted in my arm so it could heal. My arm hasn't given me any problems or trouble since about 2005, which it seems like my arm has fully healed for over the months in 2004 I had a cast on.

Because first of all...I'm in the Military & medical is FREE in the military but I get out the military in about 7 months so that would save me THOUSANDS if the plate gives me problems after I get out the military.   Second, I rather take it out now then to wait for a something to happen(plate gets out of place, irritating my arm, etc.).      P.S: The plate isn't really that big..it's about 5 inches long & 1 inch wide.

Last night my husband was playing basketball and a guy came down and kneed him in the head and then landed on his chest.  He has been having some pretty serious vision problems and pain in his chest.        He decided to make an appointment to go the dr.  When we got there we sat for almost an hour and they called him  back and said that they don't take his insurance anymore.  Although, he did call ahead of time and asked him if they accepted.        So, we went to care first.  We got to the counter and tried to get someones attention, but nobody ever came. So he signed in and we sat for an hour waiting for one of them to come.  They would not see him because he was having chest pains and said that he needed to go to the hospital.      Now he has been at the hospital for 7 hours.  I am starting to get very frustrated.  Is there a limit to how long he will have to wait?  It doesn't seem like his chest problems are bad enough for them to see him, so why couldn't carefirst?

Can your depression get worse only even If I took Paxil for 3 weeks ?      I can't take it anymore so my doctor is going to try ZOLOFT ?   Is this good drug. Please don't say to not take med...cuz rite now I am literally suicidal :( and I waited 4 months before hoping that it would go but it didn't.         3 Doctors have diagnosed me with Chem Imbalance depression/Anxiety.

20090309225307AAcIkte	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What's wrong with my stomach??? HELP!!!?	Ever since after high school, when I started college, I have experienced embarrassing and annoying symptoms of my stomach that have just taken over my life.     In class, my stomach would start to make these weird noises that kind of sounds like passing gas but inside your intestines.  This would only happen when the classroom was quiet, or when taking tests. I would feel like I was going through an internal war between trying to control my stomach and trying to concentrate and pay attention in class.   This has continued to happen in almost every class that I had.  Except in the Lab classes that are sort of spaced out and loud because of all the machinery and stuff.  In class I would feel like dying and I would often just take off from lecture because I couldn't take it.  The worst situations would be when taking exams when everyone would be extremely quiet and that would cause my stomach to really make loud noises sometimes and I would start to get really anxious and would not be able to concentrate at all.  There were a couple of occasions when I would literally just bubbled in any answers on the scantrons just to leave and as soon as I would step out the door I would feel fine, like nothing had happened.  This had caused so much stress that it's made me take a break from school.      Now, I'm working at a call center in the meantime (which I like it by the way)until I figure out what to do; and it's all fine but we have team meetings twice a week in a small conference room and the same thing is happening again.  In the meeting I'm fighting for my stomach not to make any weird noises for the whole thirty minutes, it's horrible because I'm not really paying attention to the meeting, and as soon as the meeting is over I feel fine.  When it gets close to the days when we have the meetings I start to get really nervous or anxious.I have to go use the bathroom many times during the day to feel better.      Do you guys think it's some kind of anxiety disorder? is this all in my head? if so, how does my mind make me get cramps, diarrhea, discomfort in my stomach?      What can I do? please help.  This has tormented me for the last 5 years.   Only serious answers please.

20090309211006AAT7skV	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Is it worth the pain?	Ok... I have a bone disease called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). It's a disease where all my bones are weak and fragile. For the past 2 years I've had pain in my left femur. Recently I went to the doctor and he said my leg is bending (common in OI). I have metal rods inside my legs (4    total) and he said it might break soon. When the rod breaks, then it will    break the bone. Well I have a VERY high tolerance for pain. I've    walked around in broken and fractured legs without knowing it. So for    the 2 years I could live with the pain, but now it's gotten worse. It    seems like everyday is something new: the    pain is not so bad or it's    TERRIBLE. Long story short, I need your opinion. I've had many    surgeries and 2 of them called for full body casts. If you've never been    in a body cast you wouldn't know how bad it is. Half of me wants to get    surgery so I won't be in pain, but i'd be missin a lot of important things   . We have an 8th grade party in 2 months, so I wouldn't be able to go if I had surgery because I wouldn't  be able to walk yet. I've missed out on a lot in the past because of my stupid legs an I don't want it to ruin this. I just don't know what to do. I've never talked to any about this because.... I just can't. Why Im asking for  strangers opinions is beyond    me, but I know it will help. I just can't talk to    anyone on person about this so yea... Well I    hope I'm not making myself sound emo or    anything but it's rough for me right now.    Please no rude comments. Oh and I know    most of you will probably say go get surgery    but before you type that just think if you were    in my position. The recovery is the worse.    There's spasms, medicine, big itchy body cast    for 4 weeks, and being    isolated in your house and not being able to go to school or see friends. And don't forget about being totally dependent on everyone. Please just think about this hard, and answer. Thanks. I really appreciate it

20090309213658AAkf7Lm	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Why am I showing signs of hypothermia?	What is wrong with me? Why am I showing signs of hypothermia? I haven't been outside but to go from the car to indoors. Yesterday I was incredibly tired of being sick so I gave in and went to the ER. My temp was 96o. My normal is around 96.7o. They told me I had a bad sinus infection and possibly had the flu (Influenza A is running rampant in my town right now), but weren't going to test me for the flu since I was 4 days into my illnesses. I told them this felt more than just that. I told them the night before my temperature was 94o and they raised and eyebrow to it but said it was nothing since I was 96o right then. I left the ER and within 10 minutes I started shivering really bad. I went and picked up my kids, came home fed them and got them to bed. The entire time (about an hour) I was shivering like mad, I still has the weakness and muscle aches and pains I told the ER about. I thought nothing of it, just thought I was cold. 2 hours after leaving the ER I was shivering so much I was twitching. I took my temp and I was 93o. My husband had to strip and get in bed with me with the heat up and blankets on to warm me up. Took me an hour to stop shaking and after all that time I was finally up to 95.2o.      Today I have been right around 95-96o all day. Tonight I am reading 94.2 to 95.0o. I am shivering again. I tried looking up signs and symptoms of hypothermia and I had most of the signs last night and per my temp and signs I was ranging between mild to moderate. I am starting to shake like last night again. What gives? Why am I becoming hypothermic when I haven't been "exposed" to conditions that generally cause it?
20090309222626AA5MHID	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Help with coping with a Chiari Malformation?	I have had migraines, even debilitating ones, since I was 3 years old. I have vivid memories of my mom getting on the entire house to shut up and let me sleep. She would give me migraine meds and put me in a dark quiet room to sleep it off. This went on for years. I would go months with a constant migraine. I spent thousands of dollars trying to find out why on earth I had migraines. In 2000 I went in for an overnight study at the hospital complete with CT scan and MRI. The neurologist that was overseeing me then said he couldn't find ANY reason for my migraines. I basically gave up.      When I got pregnant again in 2005 I started seeing a new neurologist because I had pre-eclampsia and was experiencing too many debilitating migraines again. He just kept helping me treat them. Finally in 2006 he asked me what I was doing for my Chiari Malformation. I looked at him like he lost his ever loving mind and asked him what on earth was he talking about. He told me when I had my MRI in 2000 the neurologist wrote down that I possibly had a Chiari Malformation. I told him just what exactly was said to me.      I got a new MRI and sure enough it was there. I was referred to a neurosurgeon and he felt mine wasn't bad enough to warrant surgery. So instead I get to suffer with constant neck pain and migraines, YAY ME! So I have one, and its bad enough to cause me pain and make my life hard to go through, but not bad enough to go through the risks of brain surgery. I take 30mg of Flexeril a day (muscle relaxers) and Maxalt MLT's as needed for migraine attacks, but I am limited to 2 maxalt's a week. Yea tell my migraines I am only allowed 2 a week! lol      Anyway, I have no insurance now and am struggling. I have had a constant headache with frequent migraines for 3 solid weeks now.      Does anyone know what more I could do to help relieve the pain/pressure from this nasty disease? What are those of you NOT getting/qualifying for surgery doing for yours?      Thanks in advance for your help!

I have old but noticeable scars on my left arm and am looking for a good reason why my partner needs to take it on my right arm (the teacher WILL BE WATCHING/GRADING US). Because it's a health class, the teacher is educated so saying "I sprained my wrist and that arm hurts" (just an example) might not work. I'm just looking for suggestions since all I can think of right now is saying "I slept on that arm wrong and it hurts so can we use my other one". Thanks. I'd also like to add that the teacher requested us to use the left arm so that is what she is expecting us to use.

20090309221629AAqoBCq	Health;Dental	Should I get clear or metal braces? (pic)?	My orthodontist didn't mention anything about the clear being more fragile, all he said was that clear will stain if I don't brush my teeth at least three times a day, which isn't really a big deal to me. Also, I wouldn't get the metal just for being able to have colors, the colors don't really matter to me either.    I'm just really afraid that if I get clear, people will do a double take wondering what's on my teeth. Although when I see people with metal braces it's almost all I can see when I look at their face, kind of like when people have a whole bunch of facial piercings, lol.      Anyhow, this is me, if that helps you decide what you think would be better for me.

20090309221602AAb1miS	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	Swollen and pink skin around stitches? is this normal?	I got six stitches on my hand 8 days ago and it's been pink, a little purple, and swollen. I went to see my campus student health center at UCSD and the nurse and doctor told me it's "part of the healing process" so they removed three stitches today and kept the other three in. When the nurse removed the stitches it really hurt. It felt like something was stinging and it didn't feel good at all (i heard that it's supposed to feel good in a way when stitches are removed. i can imagine how that's supposed to feel). I really think my stitches weren't ready to be removed and was worried that it might be infected but the staff didn't agree with me.       I read online that if it's pink or swollen, it's infected. I'm supposed to return to the health center in two days to get the rest of them removed but I want to wait longer. The doctor also told me I'm going to get a scar on my hand )= and when I first got the stitches (at a hospital) the doctor told me that getting stitches would minimize the scar. What do you guys think? Should I trust them? I feel like if I went to an actual hospital or my primary physician they would have told me something different. How much longer should I wait to remove the stitches? Sometimes it hurts and gets a little itchy. But the purple-ness really worries me. It also looks like the wound is not closing very well. Like if they removed the stitches the wound would just split open again.      Help? suggestions please. thanks!!

20090309205548AARvKJz	Health;Women's Health	Really, how bad are the health risks of the pill?	I've just re-started on Reclipsen (today is my second day). I was taking it for about six months earlier this year, but stopped for a few months. Obviously, I know it doesn't protect against STDs, and I get the normal nausea with it and such.      My question is: what realistically are the long-term health effects? I know it lists some things on the packet, but they're sort of required to post the worst-case scenario, correct? I do smoke, but very little: less than one pack every month. I have no known history of blood problems or anything. I only plan to be on the pill for a few years, and then get a historectomy or something. What, realistically, could the effects of that be?

20090309205300AALmErc	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	How did you decide to marry someone with herpes?	Two years ago I moved away from my boyfriend to finish grad. school. We decided to have an open relationship while I was gone. He ended up having a one night stand, which I can't be mad at at all, but as a result he contracted genital herpes. I'm now done with grad. school, am moving across the country, and he'd like to go with me. We talk about marriage all the time, but I'm now having trouble getting over him getting herpes.      I understand the risks and possibilities, how to protect myself, all the medical stuff, etc.  What I'm really interested in is how people decided that their partner having herpes was something that they could easily overlook.  How it affected your marriage, both positively and negatively.        A great sex life is very important to me in a relationship, and I feel that having to give up sex and oral sex on occasion because of an outbreak may be something that I'm not willing to sacrifice.

I've discovered that if I wait too long to have sex (a week or two) I will get very sore the next time I do it. I actually took a peek, and saw the bottom of the opening of my vagina had split. I've tried lubricant, and I know I don't have a STD or any other infection.This has been happening since I was 17.  I'm 30 years old now, thought I would have outgrown it by now. The last time I went to my OBGYN, she told me that my opening is very small, and every time I have sex it's going to split. Her suggestion was to get it surgically cut. That scares me, and it seems a little extreme. Are there any other things I can do to prevent me from "splitting" down there, besides what I've already tried?

20090309212837AAb2Fhb	Health;Mental Health	What is wrong with me?	I've been depressed for awhile, since my dad died in 2004. Lately, I get major depressed, like I feel so worthless. lack of energy, loss of interest, Irritability, feeling guilty over things that are not my fault, sleep problems. sometimes I even have conversations with myself. this lasts awhile, then some days I feel good, feel like I can do anything, then after a few days I go back to being depressed. i feel angry a lot, and take it out on other people. when i get even a bit angry, i feel like throwing everything against the wall. sometimes i think i see things that are not there, or i am afraid of something for no reason, like thinking someone is outside my house when there is no one. i think about death a lot, and even killing myself, but have not tried. only thought of what ways i would do it. im really agitated, and have insomnia, and anxiety. i feel like when i go out in public that everyone is staring at me or something when they are not. what is wrong with me?! its so irritating!!

20090309231913AAusGlh	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why can't I lose weight?	Since December, I committed to losing weight to become healthier. I workout at least 30 minutes a day, alternating between weight training and cardio and have even added pilates and yoga to the mix. I've lost a few inches, mainly water weight, but that's it. It's March, and while I'm not looking for drastic results, I was hoping 5 pounds by now.      I eat healthy, and try to incorporate all food groups with the main focus on veggies and fruits. I also drink tons of water.      Also, I haven't had a cycle since November and I haven't had sex. I went to the doctor to see if I had PCOS and she said I didn't (I'm thinking about getting a second opinion).      What else could be wrong?

20090309230611AA4GiN4	Health;Other - Health	I need help dealing with my grandpa's health.?	Tonight I was just sitting around minding my own business when my mother came to my bedroom door. It looked like she had been crying. I ask her "what?" and she motioned me to come out to the living room, where my dad was on the phone. I asked her "what happened?" and began to tear up. My mom said "listen to your dad". My dad called my uncle and was telling him that my grandpa was in the hospital. My grandma had taken him to one hospital 15 miles from where they lived and he had an MRI done and it showed that he had a growth in his neck. I guess he'd had some neck pains lately, but didn't think it was bad and yet decided to go to the chiropractor. (My grandpa is 64 years old).    They took him back to their town's hospital, where he is now being monitored. My grandpa used to smoke (way before I was born-I'm 19 years old now) and he still chews tobacco, but not as often as he used to.   I'm really scared. They're gonna run a biopsy on his growth, but everything is still scary for me. I don't know what to do. My grandpa is the person who taught me to sing. He helped me learn to play the guitar. He was in a band at our campground, and included me in it. He's the only person in my family who encourages my love of music. He means the world to me. He's my best friend. I could always trust him with any of my problems...and if this thing is cancerous, what am I going to do? I feel like I'm going insane right now.       Please help me with your support, your thoughts, and your experiences with this kind of situation...

20090309231233AADOqH0	Health;Mental Health	Americans and "Depression".?	I've been hearing and seeing people use depression as an excuse for everything "oh I can't work cause I'm depressed, oh I can't take care of the kids at the moment cause I'm depressed, oh I can't pay you right now cause I'm depressed, oh had to quit school cause I'm depressed..." and so and so forth, BULLCRAP!      In other parts of the world, people's lives go on regardless of how bad they're feeling or think they're feeling. One has to endure to earn a buck, you see people from third world countries going through dump sites collecting bottles and selling them so they can have something on the table come dinner time, kids walking barefeet in the woods at 4AM to get to school, mothers attending to her 15 kids while delivering sacks weighing more than her as a job, and then you see a mid 20s American woman living off welfare and refusing to get a job cause she is 'depressed'?       So I ask you, is depression just a 1st world ailment wherein you feel like the world has to stop and make for you because you're unhappy with your life? But for people you have absolutely nothing, depression is not even in their vocabulary.

20090309230446AAMuEzv	Health;Mental Health	What's wrong with me? Social Anxiety and what else?	Ever since freshmen year of high school, my social skills have degraded. I don't talk to people in ways that make sense in a normal social situation. I can tell in the way people look at me when I'm talking to them. I was in a Behavioral Disorder program in the first 2 years of high school. I wasn't violent; I was withdrawn. I lived inside my own shell out of fear and I'm pretty sure I'm still stuck inside. After sophomore year, I moved in with a divorced parent. I am currently in regular schooling but I only survive by the grace of my teachers. I don't care about school at all. On several occasions I've tried to tell jokes or have been helped in telling a joke and I laugh hysterically and uncontrollably. Another part of my situation is that I see the world in a different way. I feel like I am looking at life as a photograph. I don't see something as a real object, rather as a part of a landscape, until it hits me in the face or I try to focus, which quickly fades. I have bad anxiety, but I only had anxiety attacks twice. I look beyond the attack. I constantly think about my brain and the universe. I get depression too, usually when I think about my life as a whole. I avoid this by thinking about individual things in life. In this process, I've spanned a million branches of the tree of my life. I feel like I am too complex a person to have my problems fixed. I've been like this since I was a young child. I have no idea what may have caused all these problems in me. This is just raw facts about me. Please consider and give me feedback about what you think. Thank you.
