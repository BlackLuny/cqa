May I suggest finding a cookbook that addresses that cusine?|`|tOF7ZGhwaa	They sell seaweed sheets, which is used to hold "sushi" together, in other words, rice with veggies in the middle|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Sushi is rolled with seaweed and kale is a popular seaweed green that can be cooked like any other green and eaten.     Seaweed is also an important ingredient in toothpaste.    Agar, a byproduct in seaweed, is used in foods such as confectionery, meats and poultry products, desserts and beverages and molded foods. Carrageenan, another seaweed byproduct, is used in preparation of salad dressings and sauces, dietetic foods, and as a preservative in meat and fish products, dairy items and baked goods.    While some cultures harvest the seaweed directly from the ocean, cook and then eat it... if that's what you're looking for, then you're not going to find it.     You can, however, probably find packaged seaweed products at the grocery store. The seaweed used in sushi rolls is called 'nori.'    Or, if you lived in an Asian culture, you could buy it and eat straight from the bag, like this:    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...|`|FQ3X9Kdlaa	Put it in your mouth and chew it.    yes homo|`|AA11015885	You know that black stuff wrapped around sushi?  That is Nori, which is seaweed, which is one way.  In Hawaii, we pick "Ogo" from the sea which we use in a variety of recipes.  http://hubpages.com/hub/Easyto-Prepare-H...    Limu     term meaning "seaweed" in Hawaiian. The common varieties of seaweed in Hawaii include Asanthopora, Anfelthia, Ele'Ele, Hypnea, Kohu, Lipoa, Manauea, Ogo, Sargassum, and Sea Lettuce. The varieties most commonly served for food are the Ele'Ele, Kohu, Lipoa, and Manauea. When preparing seaweed in a dried form, soak the dried leaves for at least 5 minutes before cooking. In a fresh form, wash the seaweed to remove excess salt and particles before preparing. In a dried form, it can be kept indefinitely if stored in a sealed or airtight container placed in a dry cool area. Fresh or cooked seaweed should be stored in a refrigerator.    Shrimp Seaweed Salad   NGREDIENTS:  6 uncooked shrimp (see TIP: Shrimp)  12 edamame (green soybeans)  2 TBsp of dried seaweed cut wakame  Ponzu (citrus seasoned soysauce) for dressing    HOW TO:  First and foremost! Be sure to get the right kind of dried seaweed. Don't get the kind you see on the sushi. This is the kind that's in miso soup, and it's the kind when you soak it in the water, it expands into kelp like seaweed. With that said, soak the dried seaweed in water. Normally those things take about 10 minutes to rehydrate.    While the seaweed is being soaked in water, boil water in a pan with about a teaspoon of salt, and once the water is boiled, add edamame and shrimp (still in shells) together. Both of those only take 3 to 4 minutes to fully cook, so be sure to not overcook them.    After they finish cooking, rinse both edamame and shrimp under cold water. Place them under several ice cubes to make sure they get really chilled for a couple of minutes.    Once they are chilled, peel the shrimp, and slice it in half length wise (so that it will be thin).    Take the beans out of the pod.    When the seaweed is completed rehydrated, drain all the water, and add the thinly sliced shrimp and edamame beans and mix together.    Serve on a small bowl, and add the ponzu dressing to your liking!     Another one of my favorites is waiwaiole, with just diced tomato, onion, vinegar and shoyu.    Oh Yes, we eat seaweed and it is good for you too!|`|AA10625089	One way that you can and most likely have eaten it (without even knowing) is as a food additive called carrageenen.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Cuts differ among countries; American and British cows are "divided" in different ways, so a cut in one country would be different in the next. That said, let's look at the American cuts (since that's what you're going for). Please reference the link below to see a diagram of the American cow for butchering.        * Chuck  one of the most common sources for hamburgers/ground beef      * Rib  short ribs, rib eye steak.      * Short loin  from which porterhouse steaks are cut.      * Sirloin  less tender than short loin, but more flavorful.            o Tenderloin  the most tender, from which filet mignon is served.            o Top sirloin            o Bottom sirloin      * Round  lean cut, moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling does not allow round steak to tenderize quickly.      * Brisket  often associated with barbecue beef brisket.      * Shank  used primarily for stews and soups; it is not usually served any other way due to it being the toughest of the cuts.      * Plate  produces short ribs for pot roasting and types of steak such as the outside skirt steak for, say, fajitas and hanger steak. It is typically a cheap, tough, and fatty meat.      * Flank  used mostly for grinding, except for the long and flat flank steak, best known for use in London broil. Once one of the most affordable steaks on the market, it is substantially tougher than the loin and rib steaks, therefore many flank recipes use marinades or moist cooking methods such as braising. Popularity and leanness have resulted in increased price.|`|A0nRQHDCaa	http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/me...    where it comes from on the cow :]|`|AA11219112	the rib eye comes from the front half and is called rib steak which has bone in or rib eye which is boneless, same cut of meat differant name because of bone removed. very good with lots of marble.    porterhouse from the hind half with bone in and tenderloin on other side of bone, take bone out and it's a new york strip, t- bone same but smaller tenderloin. tenderloin itslef lies right under the back bone as is the most tender steak on the cow, because there is no movement of any part of it, therefore it lies there doing nothing,  all 3 are very good.    sirloin comes  from the hip and is the most unpredictable piece of meat, sometimes very tender other times not,it is right above the rump section.   If you take the bones out of the meat the name changes but not the tatse.    brisket is best of cooked with cabbage or cooked and shreded ( pulls apart after cooking easy ) flank is good grilled or baked and taste is good, but dry ( no fat on it )     all round meat is from the rump and very good if cooked right, baking is best , eye round, sirloin tip , bottom round and top round which is where the london broil comes from, all these baked are very tender, but also dry so need moisture cooked with it.     chuck meat also good but only if baked also, has more fat and juice but has a stringy taste.    it all depends on what tatse you have as to what you would like. if a steak can't go wrong with porter/t bone. tenderloin and rib eye or bone in rib steak.|`|AA12238474	The difference is where it comes from on the cow

How to Boil Artichokes    Boiled artichokes can be served whole, or can be further trimmed to serve only the artichoke heart. If possible, avoid boiling artichokes in aluminum or iron pots, which tend to make the artichokes turn a bit gray.    De-stem and wash the artichokes, and remove the tough outer leaves.     Bring a pot of salted water to boil.     Drop the artichokes into the boiling salted water.     Make sure that the artichokes are completely covered by the water, as the artichokes will darken if they are not. If necessary, you can stop the artichokes from floating to the surface by covering them with a heatproof dish or a cloth.     Cook for 3545 minutes, depending on size. Artichokes are finished cooking when their outer leaves can be easily detached.     Remove the artichokes from the water and drain for a few minutes by turning them upside down to let all the water run off the leaves.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	That is not a problem, it will be fine.|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	yes you can put pyrex in the oven, add alittle water

The best way to decide how to do it is read up on various different recipes available. You can broil lobster, put it in a pie, or by another method. Amongst the most popular lobster recipes is the lobster thermidor recipe, and http://www.lobster-recipe.net/?page_id=2... includes this recipe as well as other various ones that seem good.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	The most popular ways to cook lobster is either to boil the lobster or to steam it.    When it comes to boiling a lobster the best way to cook lobster is to put it in the water when its still alive.  French chefs through them into boiling water; other chefs had adopted a more humane method and they kill it just before throwing them to the boiling water.    The truth is that both methods are not too humane, and yet, you get the best taste when the lobster is still alive when you start boiling it.    So, how to cook lobster in a humane way?  Use a pot deep enough to hold 6 liters of salted water (You can tell when the water is salty enough by throwing a raw egg into the pot. If the egg floats the water are salty enough)  Put a baking stone or any kind of a roasting rack at the bottom of the pot, and place the lobster on it.  By doing it you prevent the lobster from touching the bottom of the pan and it will not be burned as the pan heats up. (You insert the lobster to the pot when the water are still at room temperature)    When you start to boil the water, use a gentle heat, gradually raise the temperature of the water to around 90F, at which point the lobster will be fast asleep.    At this stage (the best way is to check the waters temperature as not all lobsters snores) turn up the heat until the water reaches a gentle simmer.    This cooking method is not only the most humane way to cook lobster; it also brings out the best results.    The lobsters meat comes out succulent and tender, as it didnt experience any trauma when entering the water (the trauma causes the lobster to secrete adrenaline, which ends up in a less succulent meat)    Bear in mind that The Only Way to cook lobster for a great result is by buying it alive.(And remember to be careful with the claws as there is no lobster served in the E.R)    And one last tip: Whether youre having a summer cookout or a black-tie affair, fresh lobster delivered overnight makes all the different.    Indulge yourself in succulent, fresh live Maine lobsters, delivered directly from the ocean to your home.

Broil the lobster for 15 minutes a pound. If it's over 5 pounds then cook it 20 minutes a pound. Broiling a lobster will tend to dry it out. Do what the restaurants do: boil the lobster, cut open and and sprinkle Old Bay Seasoning or whatever you like, put under the broiler for several minutes or until the shell starts to burn. Serve with melted unsalted butter.|`|sqNsOIzkaa	Mmm back in Massachusetts we buy a couple. Insert a chopstick into its bladder so it doesn't contaminate the rest of the meat.

Lobsters do not have the capability to feel pain because their primitive nervous system and underdeveloped brain are similar to that of an insect. While lobsters react to different stimuli, such as boiling water, the reactions are escape mechanisms, not a conscious response or an indication of pain.|`|0Elxt7Yxaa	You could make a lobster bisque:    http://hubpages.com/hub/Delicious-Bisque...|`|tSX9wMBEaa	1.

I prefer boiling it, and using a little bit of garlic lemon and olive oil in the water. If you bake it be sure to butter it a couple of times, the meat ends up a lot tougher when you bake it so be sure to keep an eye on it. Also don't forget to have melted butter on hand when eating it. It's really pretty good. Hopefully you have Maine lobster, it's the sweetest variety in my opinion.

EMDNVrcjaa	When baking, replace 1 cup sugar with 3/4 cup of Agave Nectar.  Reduce recipe liquids 1/3 and oven temperature 25F.    Healthier Carrot Cake:  You dont have to use refined sweeteners to get a quintessential carrot cake that is moist and euphoria-producing. Healthy and scrumptious, this recipe is a total keeper.    This recipe makes 3 8-inch layers or one 9-inch by 13-inch pan.    INGREDIENTS    3/4 cup walnuts  1 1/2 cup peeled, grated carrots (3 or 4 large carrots)  3/4 cup crushed, unsweetened pineapple (fresh or canned in its own juice)  3/4 cup raisins  1 1/2 cups flour  1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon  3/4 teaspoon nutmeg  1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda  3/4 cup butter, softened  3/4 cup agave nectar  2 eggs  1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract    1. Preheat oven to 350F. Line the bottoms of cake pan or pans with parchment paper.    2. Toast the walnuts in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, then allow to cool. Chop the nuts coarsely with a knife or in a food processor.    3. Peel and grate the carrots to a medium grate. Drain the canned pineapple (reserve the juice for another use). Combine the chopped nuts, grated carrots, pineapple, and raisins, and set aside.    4. Sift together the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda into a bowl.    5. In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer on medium-high speed to cream the butter and agave nectar together until well blended. Add the eggs one at a time, incorporating the first egg before adding the second. Add vanilla extract.    6. On the lowest speed, stir in the dry ingredients. Fold the carrot mixture in by hand with a rubber or silicone spatula.    7. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, depending on pan size. The cake is done when it bounces back when touched lightly in the center.    8. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool. Make sure it is completely cool before frosting.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Just substitute the sugar in any carrot cake recipe with Splenda.  It works beautifully.  You can't really substitute a granular sweetener with a liquid one.  Carrot cakes take time and effort to make, so do it right...

Joe's is great for a lot of things, but yes, their produce section is pretty basic in some ways and great in others. I shop for a lot of my produce, because they have good sales, at Safeway or Raley's out here. We have Whole Foods also but they are way to expensive.

66t7lII8aa	Okay, So I'm a barista at the local Starbucks at my town, and hopefully I can answer your question and maybe even leave you satisfied, :]    First of all, there are MANY drinks that don't contain coffee or the taste of coffee.  When I get this question from customers, I always try to figure out exactly what they're searching for in this way.    Are you looking for a hot drink today or a cold drink?  There are many cold drinks, "frapps" without coffee such as:  Strawberries and Cream Frap  Carmel, Chocolate, Cinnamon, Chai, Green Tea, Pumpkin Spice, Toffee Nut, Hazelnut, and Rasperry flavored CREAM based frapps.    On the cold side, you can get almost any hot drink over ice also.    Double Chocolate Chip Fraps and   Blended Strawberry Lemonaide are two of the very best    Then, I always like to suggest the   Caramel Apple Spice, its like apple cider but with whipped cream and caramel on top, its AMAZING if you like apple cider hot, PLEASE try it, its one of our better drinks.    Also we do hot chocolate and hot white chocolate, but thats just a regular hot chocolate,  There's our SIgnature Hot Chocolate, which has a blend of different chocolates from around the world    There's always the Chai Tea Latte, hot or iced, but Chai is an acquired taste which some people haven't acquired.      Don't bother with the new Tea Lattes unless you're used to having milk in tea, which most people are not.          Go with the Caramel Apple Spice,   And that's right from a Barista|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Starbuck's doesn't have good coffee (it's burnt tasting) and is way over-priced.  Jitters, It's a Grind, or any other place is much better.  But, if you don't like coffee, just go to your local Jamba Juice or smoothie place instead! ......  I think there's a Strawberry Frap at Starbuck's, but it seems silly to go there just for the name|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Strawberries and cream frappucino, no coffee in it.|`|a1cfabbb9d55702ae5d31a5935b76311aa	Just have the hot chocolate, thats what I always do.

But what I usually get at any coffee place when I don't want coffee is a Chai Latte- hot or iced it is delicious!|`|ReV6Cj06aa	i just get hot chocolate there|`|qAwnAYGAaa	I like the cream based caramel frappaccino. there's no coffee so if you want to ease into it you could ask for a mix of cream and coffee|`|sPr2HhYEaa	They make a great frozen coffee cappuccino that has Chocolate whipped cream and sprinkles and when you drink it, it tastes  like Chocolate|`|0YGQ2hIMaa	Double Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino  Mint Chocolaty Chip with Chocolate Whipped Cream Frappuccino  Pumpkin Spice Frappuccino  Strawberries and Creme Frappuccino    Anytype of Frappuccino is good  those are my top ones, i really like the Strawberries and creme one for sure|`|YH8ERZg8aa	if you're looking for something beside coffee, try one of the tea lattes. vanilla rooibos is my favorite.  ..but if the idea of tea and milk doesn't sound appealling to you, and you do want to try coffee, go for the white mocha. it's sweet and delicious, and the flavor of the white mocha really masks the flavor of the espresso.|`|M5RkgBqFaa	The flavour of espresso and traditional coffee is quite different. Espresso has a nuttier, caramelly, flavour. And drip coffee or traditional coffee is more bitter. I myself, work at Starbucks and am not fond of drip coffee either.     You may try some of the frappuccinos, all creme based ones are coffee free. But the coffee ones taste nothing like drip coffee (which is what I am assuming that you dislike). They are much sweeter and not bitter at all.     You can also try a flavoured steamed milk. Vanilla is a very popular flavour.    Also, try the new lattes or the white mocha/mocha. The white mocha is very sweet and is a good "beginner" drink for people who dislike coffee but are still looking for something with espresso. It hides the espresso taste well. The mocha is the same as the white mocha, but with a dark chocolate syrup instead.    You can also try an Apple Chai or a Caramel apple spice. Both are mainly steamed apple juice. The apple chai has chai syrup in it which is a tea with spices. The caramel apple spice has cinnamon dolce syrup in it and is topped off with whipped cream and caramel drizzle! Delicious!|`|iGr0sywGaa	Well, when I started drinking Starbucks coffee, I got a Caramel Macchiato, but I had been drinking coffee a while before then.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	This article was in the Washington Post a few months ago. Educators and University Presidents all over the country want the drinking age lowered. It's main argument? Prevent binge drinking... from the article:    Educators Urge Lower Drinking Age to Cut Bingeing     By Susan Kinzie  Washington Post Staff Writer  Wednesday, August 20, 2008; Page B03    Scores of college presidents, including the head of Maryland's public university system and the president of Johns Hopkins University, have an unexpected request for legislators: Please, lower the drinking age.    The Amethyst Initiative, launched in July, is a coalition of college presidents who say that the legal drinking age of 21 encourages binge drinking on campuses. William Kirwan, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, William Brody, president of Johns Hopkins, C.D. Mote Jr. of the University of Maryland and the presidents of Washington and Lee, Sweet Briar, Towson, Randolph-Macon, Duke, Tufts, Dartmouth and others have signed on to the effort.    It is likely to be difficult politically to change the drinking age, which has been 21 since the mid-1980s.    In a survey released yesterday by Nationwide Insurance, which is hosting a symposium on binge drinking in Washington in November with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, 75 percent of adults said they support tougher enforcement of existing drinking laws.  __________________________________    Information is power; and many studies do indicate that a lower drinking age could potential lessen problems among college students when it comes to binge drinking. But an attitude will need to change too; parents and teachers will have to take a more responsibility based approach to alcohol; teaching students to respect it and use it only in moderation, rather than completely abstain.|`|AA12095483	Hmm. There really aren't any good reasons, because physiologically, alcohol affects the immature brain to a greater extent than it affects the mature brain and the brain doesn't mature until 25. Ipso facto, the argument ought to be that the drinking age should be raised.   However, that's not your assignment.   You might talk about reducing the element of risk and danger by legalizing something that has hitherto been illegal, and thus removing some of the appeal (for those who like eating forbidden fruit)  You might also be able to present a case for learning how to handle your liquor - being able to have just one or two social drinks instead of getting blotto because you had to do your drinking in sprees.   Other than that - can't think of much that's helpful.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	At 18 you can join the military and die for your country but you can't drink.|`|rsTB7D1zaa	Of course there are.|`|DFXS4SB4aa	* The decline in traffic accidents may have to do with other factors besides a higher drinking age.    * The biggest effect on later risk of alcohol dependence is for people who start drinking in their early teens as opposed to ages 18 to 21.    * There is little evidence that mild or moderate drinking harms the developing brain.    * Some evidence exists that teens in countries with a lower drinking age are less likely to drink to intoxication.    * Rates of binge drinking among college-age youths have increased.    http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/25194  http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/01/...  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|iE2sDxDAaa	1.

So your 18 and you choose to drink and drive...fine..you will be punished for it.  So your 17 and you choose to drink and drive...your parents are responsible, your not an adult...allowing freedom to one age group over another (when both are adults) is persecution...nothing more or less, doesn't matter how you spin it.|`|QQbSIrBxaa	From what I understand one of the major reasons they moved the drinking age back up to 21 was because of the increase in motor vehicle accidents involving people between the ages of 18-21 so I guess you could argue that if they lower the age back down they would have to enforce drunk driving more which would *hopefully* keep people of all ages off the road after having been out drinking.  Not that this would work in reality but could be used as an argument in a paper.|`|JuiZR23Paa	It would decrease the amount of teenagers that get in trouble each year.|`|PFT4T5Craa	You are legally an adult at 18  You can vote  You can go to war  You can sell your body to science  You can work in the sex industry  In some states you can be executed at 18

v4vQSzu4aa	Oh, what a nightmare, this I do not envy you my friend, I would be going crazy, but it does present a unique way of cooking, thankfully only for the next two weeks.  You could boil some chicken/turkey breasts with some water, bouillon cubes and seasonings then add them to some steamed veggies (put some frozen veggies in a glass bowl, small amount of water and seasonings) and put the lid on and steam away!  You could make some mashed potatoes (cut and steam potatoes, drain water, then stir in some milk, butter, S&P) , steamed red skins or any type of potatoes with some Olive Oil, butter and seasonings, I'm not a fan of microwavable dinners, but Stouffers makes an edible Lasagna, you could also buy some soup and bump it up by adding in some precooked pasta (freezer section at the store)  and extra veggies, making it more like a stew!  Some of the boxed Rice starches are nice with some veggies and boiled chicken or turkey.  Anyways, I wish you luck and hope that these two weeks go by fast, congratulations on your upcoming wedding! I see the sacrificing part of your marriage has already started!|`|f51d44e105a2a3f4397e420c549a4437aa	Get either Ziplock Zip 'n Steam or Glad Simply Cooking microwave steaming bags.  You can steam boneless chicken or fish fillets in about 5 minutes.  Frozen veggies in about the same amount of time.  A potato takes a little longer, about 10 minutes.  Something I make when I am cooking just for myself;  1 boneless chicken thigh  1 cup frozen vegetables (what ever is on hand)  1 small red potato, cubed  Mrs. Dash  It all goes in a bag and gets microwaved for 6-8 minutes  Since you probably don't want to worry about a knife or cutting, just skip the potato.  You can buy many different sides in the deli section of the grocery that are designed for the microwave.  It will cost a little more than an all-in-one TV dinner, but still less than eating out.|`|rWUV9iTRaa	The pink ribbon i"m seeing signifies breast cancer awareness.  My wife is a seven year survivor and it got me very interested in healthier cooking.  Foods are non nutritious when cooked in a micro.  Do your best not to use it.  Go to a supermarket and buy some organic produce, extra virgin olive oil, good quality vinegar, some grilled or roasted chicken at the deli counter and chow down on some good food.  If you can't get plates and silverware from the hotel then buy paper plates and plastic utensils.|`|ubrYk78waa	Try to find a bookstore and get the cheapest microwave cookbook you can find. It may even come in handy when you get home.  Casserole dishes come out great. You can do Shake 'N Bake chicken.  I made up a dish on my own. I was divorced and had custody of my son. I would get home from work late and needed to cook quick. The book I got with the microwave was great  The dish I made up consisted of rice, a couple of pork chops and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  1. cook the rice.  2 put in the bottom of a casserole dish and add the two pork chops.  3. Cover with the soup.  4. cover with waxed paper and cook about 8 minutes.  5. Remove from oven and cover with foil for 5 minutes.  6 Cook some frozen veggies, I like corn.  Less the a half hour.  If you have the time you can cook a roast in the microwave, about 6 minutes a pound. Cover with waxed paper to keep the steam in. Backed potatoes take about 8 minutes.|`|tc1oaf6taa	1.

I do, I do!  Although, I will say that "indoor grilling" still doesn't replace the taste of outdoor charcoal grills, the smoke and flavors of the outdoors but hey, we do what we can, yes?  Also, George Foreman and Amazon have a great re-turn policy if you do not like it or it doesn't suit your needs, so it's a win-win situation either way.  We won't know unless we try, right?

When I worked the night shift long ago, I still had breakfast in the middle of the afternoon before work.

fZnuyKSZaa	Spicy foods cause runny noses for one simple reason: they contain a number of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that elevate the production of mucus in the nasal membranes. This leads to an increase in the draining action of the nasal passages. While the result may not be aesthetically pleasing, there are actually a number of reasons why this may be a good thing for your body.    The fact that spicy foods cause runny noses is also a clear sign that your body needs to expel excess mucus. The properties of the spices do not cause your body to manufacture more mucus. Rather, they help the veins and arteries in your body to open up and begin to flush out elements that could eventually lead to blockages in your system. This natural phase of house cleaning helps to keep your body in much better operating condition. Spicy foods are natures way of allowing the body to perform general maintenance, ensuring fewer health issues and promoting quicker recovery.     Just because spicy foods cause runny noses does not mean that every time you have a spicy dish that your nose is going to run like a water faucet. Basically, if there isnt much that needs to be expelled from the body, then there will not be much in the way of nose running. While it is true that no one is fond of having a runny nose, the fact is that many people report being able to breathe more clearly and feeling less head congestion after a plateful of hot Thai noodles and a few moments of wiping the nose. In short, the health benefits far outweigh the inconvenience of a couple moments of a runny nose.     Keep in mind that because spicy foods cause runny noses, your body is able to deal more effectively with maintaining a proper balance and you in turn enjoy a stronger sense of well being.        My nose runs like a well as soon as I eat spicy food.. and when my second son was overdue the midwife suggested a nice hot curry as a natural starter for contractions. It did work...|`|AXAyuFW8aa	That may just be you. I never have any problems when consuming hot and/or warm food. Try taking cold or fever reducers and see what happens.|`|AA11431433	No ,not at all.

ANcCxdEfaa	Ok, I'm FROM Buffalo, NY and I'll almost guarantee you that the first Buffalo Wings did not go down like the  recipes in those links.    For Buffalo Wings:    Take about 12 wing pieces and LIGHTLY coat them in flour.  To do this, place wings in a zip lock bag and slowly add the flour (while shaking wings in between) until all pieces are coated.  Seasoning the flour is NOT necessary as the hot sauce will have plenty of flavor.  But, you can add a little salt and pepper if you really want or just use pan searing flour.    (You can skip the flour if you want but a light coating will help the sauce stick.)    Deep fry them in 375 - 400 F degree oil for 12 minutes.  If the oil doesn't cover the wings all the way, flip them at the half way mark.    While the wings are frying, prepare 1/2 cup of Frank's Hot Sauce, 1/2 cup of butter or margarine and 1/2 cup of honey.  The butter will help the sauce stick and cut down on the heat of the sauce.  The hotter you want them, add less butter.  Heat all of this in a small sauce pot, just hot enough so the honey is not so think.  DO NOT BOIL!!!    When wings are done, place on paper towels to drain and then add sauce and wings in a bowl and toss until coated.  I made these for the super bowl and it was like being home!    If you want to use the oven instead, just coat the wings in olive oil (sesame oil will add a nice flavor) and bake around 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until done (1 hour tops, don't dry them out).    Take wings out (boneless or bone in), toss with sauce and put under the broiler for 5 minutes or so.    If you want more chicken, adjust sauce accordingly.  You can taste the sauce while on the stove to determine if it's too hot or not but keep in mind that if you dip the wings in blue cheese while eating them, it will knock a few notches off of the heat...    As far as them coming out soggy, cooking them in too low a temperature or having too many wings being cooked at one time will do that.  Try removing the foil.  The oil on the wings should prevent them from sticking.    Enjoy!|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Forget the youtube recipe. Flour is a no no as well as garlic & ginger. I just over fry the wings, douse with a lot of hot sauce. Serve with celery and blue cheese dressing. How did you get boneless wings? Here's the website: http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/Am...|`|ylJoUuMDaa	Okay, I carefully watched and read both those recipes and they seem delicious.  You're supposed to making wings, not boneless tenderloins.  Of course you're not going to get the same effect.  If your second try was super orange, you put too much hot sauce on them.  Notice he just sprinkles a bit on the wings.  Try again and use chicken wings the next time like you're supposed to.  Make sure your oven is at the right temperature too.|`|ZEkLLFrkaa	Chances are it didn't turn out crispy because the tenderloins of the chicken breast are Juicer when cooked.   Next time try salting the tenderloins and let sit over night to "dry them out" a bit.   also maybe use a bit more oil on the pan and start if and finish it off at a higher heat to crisp it up.|`|rWUV9iTRaa	There's nothing worse than fatty wings.  Just saw the youtube video they looked tasty but needed to be cooked at a higher temperature.     I have an awesome recipe for boneless buffalo wings:  http://www.appetizers-and-dips.com/buffa...  The photo was taken when they were still hot and I brought them to a party that night and they were a big hit.      The recipe calls for boneless chicken breasts.  Just slice them across the breast so they are about the same size as a wing. Enjoy !!    PS. The recipe uses sea salt.  You can use any salt you have, however unrefined sea salt is much healthier.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	I didn't look at the link, but I'm hoping you broiled them to make them crispy.|`|sa7Uq9d2aa	Just buy some already made :)
DIxbib1paa	coffee+mint=sick|`|ylJoUuMDaa	After one date I think he will think you're pushing a little too hard.  Make him something further down the road, like at Easter.  Also, that combo sounds awful, too many flavors.  Guys like chocolate, period.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	Make the mocha mint ones!  Those sound awesome!!!  If you're not sure how to make them... here's a recipe for Chocolate Mint Dessert Brownies.    CHOCOLATE MINT DESSERT BROWNIES    INGREDIENTS:  1 cup white sugar   1/2 cup butter, softened   4 eggs   1 1/2 cups chocolate syrup   1 cup all-purpose flour   2 cups confectioners' sugar   1/2 cup butter, softened   2 tablespoons creme de menthe liqueur   6 tablespoons butter   1 cup semisweet chocolate chips      DIRECTIONS:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.   In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in the chocolate syrup. Stir in the flour until just blended. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.   Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until top springs back when lightly touched. Cool completely in the pan.   In a small bowl, beat the confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup butter or margarine and creme de menthe until smooth. Spread evenly over the cooled brownies, then chill until set.   In a small bowl over simmering water, or in the microwave, melt the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter and the chocolate chips, stirring occasionally until smooth. Allow to cool slightly, then spread over the top of the mint layer. Cover, and chill for at least 1 hour before cutting into squares.|`|SqPVrEaCaa	not to me;  i do not personally care for mint flavor|`|qfgb1eNpaa	totally yeah. but i have never been into orange and chocolate together, its more of an acquired taste so i would go for the mocha mint cuz those sounds AWESOME!! ;)|`|9CN0otoQaa	You could make some fudge brownies and frost with chocolate buttercream made with coffee instead of cream.  The orange sounds good too.  Maybe add some orange zest to the batter and some chocolate chips.  Or add chocolate mint chips to the batter and frost with chocolate buttercream with a couple drops of peppermint oil.  They all sound good.  It's a hard decision.|`|ZadOtSlOaa	Honestly I think your best bet would be classic fudge brownies, and you can put chocolate chips in them too if you want to make it extra special. I'm not sure what your guy is like, but all the guys I've dated were kind of picky eaters and would prefer regular brownies over ones with different flavors added.    But if you still want to do one of those flavors, I'd say mocha is your best bet!|`|4ATVeTJzaa	oh my gosh!  that sounds really good.  and the orange to.  that's my favorite combo-orange/chocolate and mint/chocolate and mocha/chocolate!  but mocha mint! WOAH! THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC!    you are a great person!  combine the two!

Ad un matrimonio c'era una signora piuttosto anziana al tavolo degli antipasti a buffet. Ad un certo punto dice a suo figlio: "ma sai che le olive che danno sono senza polpa e non sanno di niente?" "Mamma... ma che dici? Se sono olive normali? Ma dove le hai prese?" "Da qui" (ed indica un piatto) "Mamma... mettiti gli occhiali. Ti sei mangiata i noccioli sputati dagli altri".  Da ragazza ho assaggiato un po' di carne da una scatoletta di cibo per gatti. L'odore era di simmenthal, il sapore non era male, mi sono disgustata dopo quando il mio ragazzo mi ha detto che essendo cibo per animali potevano esserci impastati in mezzo anche insetti (bleah). Ciao    P.S.: Mi  venuta in mente un'altra cosa. Su una torta c'erano delle figure di zucchero ed una paperetta in mezzo. Il mio ragazzo (che mi ha sempre chiamata papera) mi ha porto la paperella dicendomi di mangiarla e ho addentato una zampa... dura che non ti dico ma per non farlo dispiacere, visto che mi aveva riservato l'unica paperella, l'ho mandata gi... e quel fetente: "ma come hai fatto a mangiarti la zampa della papera di plastica???" Lo volevo ammazzare... ed alla fine l'ho sposato. Dice che sono "perita per aria" ( un modo di dire per definire chi  eternamente distratto) e che con me non si annoia mai.

62781038683284ebc6addf47866c7876aa	Use the broad surface of a knife (blade edge pointed AWAY from you) or the convex surface of a spoon to smash the clove, which loosens the skin so you can peel it away.  Once you peel it, mince it.      3/4 TEAspoon of garlic powder is the equivalent of 1 TABLEspoon of fresh, chopped garlic.      A conservative estimate would be that garlic salt is about 2/3 garlic and 1/3 salt (you can always add more salt, so it's okay if this turns out not to be enough).      So I would use about 1 TBSP of fresh, chopped garlic and 2 teaspoons salt.      Hope this helps!|`|AA11898687	ok no press use the flat side of a knife.

Keep rubbing and it will become like a paste. Its a great trick.|`|AA11397833	Take one clove of garlic and take the skin off. Use the back of yuor knife to smoosh it and then chop the garlic.

Try a chocolate mousse.|`|GCZaK7CYaa	My family always has Potato Pankakes with Salmon Cakes  This is a great recipe if you have the time...otherwise they do have some great mixes from the box. For dessert keep it simple ice cream or sorbet.    2 pounds russet (baking) or Yukon Gold potatoes   1 medium onion   1/2 cup chopped scallions, including the green part   1 large egg, beaten   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste   Vegetable oil for frying     Preparation1. Peel the potatoes and put in cold water. Using a grater or a food processor coarsely grate the potatoes and onions. Place together in a fine-mesh strainer or tea towel and squeeze out all the water over a bowl. The potato starch will settle to the bottom; reserve that after you have carefully poured off the water.     2. Mix the potato and onion with the potato starch. Add the scallions, egg, and salt and pepper.     3. Heat a griddle or non-stick pan and coat with a thin film of vegetable oil. Take about 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture in the palm of your hand and flatten as best you can. Place the potato mixture on the griddle, flatten with a large spatula, and fry for a few minutes until golden. Flip the pancake over and brown the other side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Serve immediately. You can also freeze the potato pancakes and crisp them up in a 350-degree oven at a later time.     Variation: If you want a more traditional and thicker pancake, you can add an extra egg plus 1/3 cup of cornmeal to the batter.

I guess it depends on the price range youre going for and how lavish you want things to be. (Example: ordering a cake can take months in advances if ordering from somewhere like Charm City Cakes from the show Ace of Cakes.)    It all depends on what vendors you go to and what you want.    All in all, i give it 1-3months prior to the occasion.    You could always call the vendors and ask as well.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Wow, sounds like your daughter is a spoiled brat.

So phone around 2 months early to be on the safe side  For the invites, see when your daughter wants them to be made and given, and that's how you decide  Alot of things need sayy a month in advance  So, try and prepare everything like designs  Then yull know what you want when you come to order it  And won't be all aaghh wts goin on!  So to keep you busy, start organising now, and order later!  Hope I helped x

AA11249458	I'm not sure there is a "best" way, but I love whole trout baked in salt.  Tuck a bunch of fresh herbs in each trout's body cavity, then lay the fish on a baking tray and completely (completely!) cover them with kosher salt.  Sprinkle it with a little water, and then bake for 10-15 minutes in a hot oven.    The salt will form a hard crust, which will pull the skin off when you break it.  The fish will be VERY creamy & yummy, and (paradoxically) not at all salty...    Bon appetit!|`|AA11156479	what is a moven

Shoes and Lots haven't had any good sweet breads, and I guess you haven't, either. When made correctly, they're actually very tastey, mildly sweet breads, depending on flavor, that can be served or eaten with tea, coffee, or any other hot beverage, or alone at a party with egg nog or even cider.|`|cc5048b4f2837724d3c5c3f1ac523005aa	Sweetbread is the name of a dish made of the thymus (neck/throat/gullet sweetbread) or the pancreas (belly/stomach/heart sweetbread) of an animal younger than one year old. These animals are usually piglets or calves.    The two organs have very different biological functions, but look fairly similar and so are considered, for the purpose of cooking, to be comparable. Thymus sweetbreads are slightly longer and more irregular, with pancreas sweetbreads being larger and more rounded.    Sweetbread is highly perishable and is considered a good source of vitamins and minerals.    Sweetbreads are simple to prepare and cook. Preparation is usually by boiling for a time, after which the fatty sinew is removed carefully without breaking the sweetbreads up. Unlike kidneys which require salting and soaking, sweetbread is simply seasoned and fried, with a knob of butter to finish. Often sweetbreads are crumbed, deep fried, and served with a slice of lemon.    A popular French recipe (ris de veau frites) involves calf's sweetbreads, which are first boiled with carrots, celery stalks, shallots, garlic, and aromatic herbs, then taken out and dried before being dipped into wheat flour and fried in a pan with butter. Fried sweetbreads are served with beurre noir poured over them. Sweetbread is also a primary ingredient for many classic rago?t recipes, such as rago?t fin.    In Argentina and Uruguay, sweetbreads (mollejas) are usually used for an asado. In northern Spain, they are cooked as a stew in an earthen casserole.    In Turkey, uykuluk (Turkish for sweetbread) is a popular dish to go with raki. Lamb sweetbreads are favoured in Turkey. The preparation of the meat before cooking is very important as this is a delicate part of the animal. Normally it's boiled for a short time and then immersed in cold water. After that the thin layer of skin should be peeled off. Then it's ready to be cooked. Mostly it's cooked either in a bit of butter or over the grill. Some red pepper, oregano and salt is added to the meat after the first 5 minutes of cooking. Istanbul's Stlce quarter is well-known for its restaurants specialised in preparing sweetbreads.|`|AA12164089	from what i've heard, yep. not as sweet..or bready as they sound|`|AA10686104	yes, but i think it might refer to other organs as well, like kidneys. a butcher could tell you, or any book on dressing out wild game, probably.|`|0b5a56782995bbba12d4a4575376a75baa	NOPE!!!  They are really a gland from the neck of cattle..|`|AA10120422	I agree w/Mark & Rainy. They're more less classified as organ meats.|`|d2b7becc4656b962fd6d7952fd6f310faa	yuck! I hope not .

The dough is enriched with butter and eggs, flavored with raisins, pine nuts, and orange and lemon zest, and topped with candied fruits, sugar, and citrus zest. It is formed into a large ring shape and baked until golden. It is the custom to insert a dried bean and a small coin or gift into the dough before baking. Whoever receives the slice of bread containing the bean is the person designated to make the bread the following year.

In separate bowl, beat butter with sugar and lemon and orange zests until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each addition. Add mixture to flour mixture and mix in flour from sides to form soft dough. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Knead until soft, smooth, silky and elastic, about 10 minutes. Knead in dried fruit and pine nuts until evenly distributed.    Place dough into clean bowl and cover with dish towel. Let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.

Ingredientes:     -Pollo   -Conejo   -Judas verdes, variedad ferraura   -Garrofn   -Tomate   -Una cucharadita de pimentn molido   -Arroz, variedad bomba   -Agua   -Aceite de oliva   -Sal   -Azafrn o colorante     Preparacin:   Una paellera, (recipiente), se pone al fuego con aceite y sal, cuando este caliente se va echando la carne troceada y se dora bien. Cuando este dorada se a?ade las judas verdes a trozos y el garrofn, si es tierno, en caso contrario se a?ade al echar el agua. Despus a?adiremos el tomate y le daremos unas vueltas, pondremos el pimentn y enseguida llenaremos la paella de agua, ojo que el pimentn se quema enseguida, dejaremos que hierva y reduzca. Rellenaremos el agua perdida en la ebullicin, y cuando vuelva a hervir pondremos el azafrn, rectificaremos de sal y pondremos el arroz, la cantidad es siempre el doble de agua que de arroz. Una manera fcil de poner la cantidad justa es hacer un montoncito con el arroz de asa a asa de la paella dejando que salga por encima del agua, y eso nos dar la cantidad justa. Dejar cocer a fuego fuerte unos diez minutos y despus bajar el fuego hasta secar el arroz, (total unos 18 a 20 minutos) dejar reposar y servir en la misma paella.

Q4AjWSUGaa	basically, to talk in simplest terms and to not be overly scientific with you....    your stomach nerves send messages to your brain that something harmful and threatening is in there.  All that alcohol is too much for your system to digest normally.  So, your brain accepts that fact that something is attacking your body, and gets rid of it in the fastest way possible, therefore you vomit.      It may suck, but it is the best and quickest way to get the alcohol out of your body and prevent a hangover.      My best suggestion for avoidance would be to drink a little less, and drink a little slower.  Be safe  :-)|`|ApAlXezlaa	the medulla oblongata monitors alcohol levels and when it deems them to be approaching a dangerous level it will expunge the materials from the stomach to prevent coma or death|`|wMXsyQRwaa	dude, that's disgusting...because you have too much acid in your stomach, not any bases...try mixing baking soda and water and drink it(you're going to burb a lot) it's chemistry|`|VIcKYiFVaa	It may be because you didn't eat before you started drinking; i.e.- there was nothing solid in your stomach

The animals are not confined to inhumanely small boxes and kept in dismal conditions.  These animals are free to roam outdoors, eating sweet grass and drinking pure water.  The care that is taken with them is the way animals should be raised. In fact, I love it so much, I purchased 23 acres in the Sierra Nevada foothills to raise the same meat for myself here in the US.

You also might consider buying the more expensive but higher-quality herbs which come in plastic packages with labels describing exactly what type and species the herb is.  Another possibility is to buy from your local co-op, farmers' market, or health food store, where you'll not only be able to find out exactly what you are purchasing, but will also be supporting local farmers and merchants (rather than some huge conglomerate grocer who probably gets their product from another state or even another country).|`|eyQBvbzraa	MINT IS MINT PLANT.USED FOR COOKING.SORRY ABOUT THE CAPS,MY EYES ARE HURTING TODAY.

For efficiency, you can prepare the soup ingredients while the beans simmer and the garnishes while the soup simmers. Though you do not need to offer all of the garnishes listed below, do choose at least a couple; garnishes are essential for this soup as they add not only flavor but texture and color as well. Leftover soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 or 4 days; reheat it in a saucepan over medium heat until hot, stirring in additional chicken broth if it has thickened beyond your liking.     Makes About 9 Cups, Serving 6     Beans  1 pound dried black beans (2 cups), rinsed and picked over   4 ounces ham steak , trimmed of rind   2 bay leaves    5 cups water    1/8 teaspoon baking soda    1 teaspoon table salt      Soup  3 tablespoons olive oil    2 large onions , chopped fine (about 3 cups)   1 large carrot , chopped fine (about 1/2 cup)   3 ribs celery , chopped fine (about 1 cup)   1/2 teaspoon table salt    5 - 6 medium cloves garlic , minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 1/2 tablespoon)   1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes    1 1/2 tablespoons ground cumin    6 cups low-sodium chicken broth    2 tablespoons cornstarch    2 tablespoon water    2 tablespoons lime juice , from 1 to 2 limes     Garnishes   lime wedges     minced fresh cilantro leaves     red onion , finely diced    avocado , diced medium    sour cream        1. FOR THE BEANS: Place beans, ham, bay, water, and baking soda in large saucepan with tight-fitting lid. Bring to boil over medium-high heat; using large spoon, skim scum as it rises to surface. Stir in salt, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer briskly until beans are tender, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours (if necessary, add another 1 cup water and continue to simmer until beans are tender); do not drain beans. Discard bay. Remove ham steak (ham steak darkens to color of beans), cut into 1/4-inch cubes, and set aside.    2. FOR THE SOUP: Heat oil in 8-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking; add onions, carrot, celery, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, pepper flakes, and cumin; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in beans, bean cooking liquid, and chicken broth. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, to blend flavors, about 30 minutes.     3. TO FINISH THE SOUP: Ladle 1 1?2 cups beans and 2 cups liquid into food processor or blender, process until smooth, and return to pot. Stir together cornstarch and water in small bowl until combined, then gradually stir about half of cornstarch mixture into soup; bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, to fully thicken. If soup is still thinner than desired once boiling, stir remaining cornstarch mixture to recombine and gradually stir mixture into soup; return to boil to fully thicken. Off heat, stir in lime juice and reserved ham; ladle soup into bowls and serve immediately, passing garnishes separately.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	Lol, type "recipes" into google and you'll come up with about 3 billion recipes. Offer to cook one night a week, and your problem will be solved. I hope your family aren't too fussy to eat your cooking though. That's really disheartening.|`|AA10027242	First off, maybe consider limiting fast food and restaurants to once or twice a month.  It'll force you to learn to cook different things.  Also, you'll be healthier.  Fast food is horrible for you.        Don't worry, there are lots of quick, easy, healthy options!   Try making tacos.  It's so easy, just gotta brown some ground meat, sprinkle in some taco seasoning, put it in tortillas, throw on some salsa, sour cream, veggies and shredded cheese and you've got dinner!       Also, maybe you could consider getting a crock pot.    Most recipes are really easy, and when you come home at night, dinner will be ready.  One of my favorite things to do is to put in one pound diced chicken breast, one jar of salsa, 2 cans of black beans,  and half a cup of brown rice.  Mix it all together and put it on low for 8 hours.       Stir fry is good.  I like to use shrimp, and put in broccoli, onion, shiitake mushroom, red or orange bell pepper and pea pods.   If you can find it, try cooking it in extra virgin coconut oil.  It gives it a tropical kind of taste.  (Don't use the refined coconut oil.  It's not as healthy and it loses it's coconut taste when it's refined.)  Add a small amount of soy sauce, and serve over rice.     Check out recipezaar.com and allrecipes.com.

Dip drumsticks into the egg mixture, shake off excess liquid, and then roll in the breadcrumb mix to coat.  Place crispy chicken drums in an oven pan and bake for 40 minutes or until chicken tests cooked when a sharp knife is inserted deep into the meat and the juices run clear.       Soup: Vegetable.   (by Dune 25/1/08)  1 lb. stew beef, cubed  1 lb. ox tails  Beef soup bone (if available)  1 tsp. seasoning salt  1 tsp. black, white and cayenne pepper  1/4 tsp. marjoram leaves  1/4 tsp. thyme leaves  1 bay leaf  Dash of sugar  1 med. onion, chopped  1 c. celery, chopped  3 c. of diced white potatoes  1 (20 oz.) bag frozen mixed vegetables or leftover vegetables in refrigerator  1 can stewed tomatoes  1 can tomato paste   In large stock pot, add meat, seasonings, onion, celery and cover with water.

Stir in the tomatoes and tomato puree, and add the corn flour. Leave to simmer, stirring occasionally, for about fifteen minutes, or until thickened.   Meanwhile, peel and chop potatoes and boil until soft, then mash them with the butter and salt and pepper to taste.   Put the filling into a deep dish, then top with the mashed potatoes and put under a warm grill (broiler) until the top is brown and crisp.   Delicious topped with melted cheese.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	A couple of menu items my mother would do are meatloaf boats and stuffed spareribs.     For the meatloaf boats, you mix up your favorite meat loaf mixture. Take hot dog bun halves and fold aluminum foil around the bottom and up the sides to about 1 - 1 1/2 inches above the top of the bun. Spread the meatloaf mixture on top of the buns and bake at 375 until done, approx 35-45 min. You can adjust the time up or down depending on your oven or how well done you like your meat.    For the stuffed spareribs there is no exact recipe. Basically you buy a rack or two of ribs that will feed your family. If you buy only one rack, cut the rack in half, rub both inside and outside with your favorite spices. Put under the broiler and brown the racks on one side then turn over and brown the other side. When browned, remove from oven and heap your favorite stuffing recipe on the inside portion of one rack. Place the other rack on top and return to a 325-350 oven and bake until done, approx 45 - 60 minutes. The meat should be nice and tender. Let rest, cut the ribs apart and serve with the stuffing. I prefer pork ribs, but  beef, lamb, game ribs work just as well.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	wow! That's a rut! I'll post a website for easy recipes.    http://allrecipes.com/Default.aspx|`|zawmsUO1aa	I went to school with someone whose family ate like that - she found it a comfort, but I think it would make me move out.    Our menu is based on what's in season, what's on sale and what's in the pantry or freezer that needs consuming. We very rarely eat fast food because we can't afford it.     Instead of suggesting a change, why don't you go pro-active and actually make a change? Offer to cook a meal and see what everyone thinks of it. Here's one that's easy:    Meatballs    Delicious with cooked pasta or as a meatball sandwich.      1 LB ground beef or ground meat of your choice  ? cup unseasoned dry bread crumbs  ? cup Romano or Parmesan cheese, finely grated  ? cup whole milk  ? cup low-sodium beef broth (optional)   ? cup chopped fresh parsley  1 egg, beaten  1 teaspoon dried oregano  2 teaspoons garlic, minced  2 teaspoons kosher salt  2 teaspoons ground black pepper  1 teaspoon dried basil  ? teaspoon dried pepper flakes  Pinch nutmeg    Yield: about 16 golf-ball sized meatballs    Combine all ingredients and stir thoroughly with a fork.   Bake at 425F for 25 minutes or fry as desired.    To freeze: place meatballs on cookie sheet, 1 inch apart and freeze one hour. Pop the frozen meatballs off the tray and place in a zipper-type baggie. Roll up and return to freezer. To use, bake from frozen at 425F for 30 minutes.|`|isA4wtnMaa	You can help your family get out of this rut be suggesting going to new restaurants.

Add the tomatoes, olives, raisins, white wine, capers, and crushed red pepper flakes and cook until the tomatoes have broken down slightly and the sauce is slightly thickened,7 to 10 minutes. Add kosher salt and black pepper, to taste, and set aside to keep warm.   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package directions until just al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, and place the pasta in a large mixing bowl along with the hot pasta sauce and the basil. Toss to combine, adding pasta cooking water 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time to thin the sauce, if necessary. Serve the pasta in shallow bowls, drizzled with the remaining olive oil and garnished with the feta cheese.   Yield: 4 to 6 servings             Hot German Potato Salad      6 Yukon gold potatoes cut into cubes  8 ounces thick sliced bacon, cut into pieces   Salt and freshly ground black pepper   1/2 red onion, diced   2 tablespoons capers, drained   3 tablespoons red wine vinegar   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil   Put diced potatoes into a pot and fill with cold water (water should just cover the potatoes). Put pot on stove on medium flame and add salt. When water comes to a boil, and the potatoes are cooked, drain the potatoes and spread  out on a side towel to dry.   While potatoes are doing their thing, add bacon to a large saute pan and cook over a low/medium flame. When the bacon is cooked remove with a slotted spoon and drain the bacon fat, reserving some if you want to add it later. Wipe out the pan with a wad of paper towels (and crank up the heat), add a decent amount of a neutral oil, like canola, and heat it until you get some smoke.   Once the oil is hot, carefully add the potatoes and shake the pan a couple of times to make sure nothing sticks. Lower the heat a little and let the potatoes brown. Season with salt and pepper.     After a few minutes, shake the pan and get the other sides going. When the potatoes are almost completely cooked, add the red onion and let everything cook together. Once the onions are caramelized, add the capers, red wine vinegar and deglaze. When the vinegar is mostly evaporated, add the extra-virgin olive oil, mustard and bacon (and reserved bacon fat if you want), re-season with lots of cracked black pepper. Serve warm.          CHEESY TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE  1 (12 1/2 oz.) can chunk light tuna in water  1 pkg. frozen vegetables  1 (12 oz.) pkg. wide egg noodles  Season to taste  1 can cream of mushroom soup  1 1/2 c. milk  1 (8 oz.) container sour cream  1 1/2 c. grated Cheddar cheese  1 1/2 c. grated Mozzarella cheese   Cook and drain vegetables. Heat soup, milk, and sour cream. Blend until smooth. Cook and drain noodles. Mix all ingredients together with tuna and 3/4 cups each of Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese. Pour into 9 x 13 inch pan. Top with remaining cheese and bake in 350 degree oven for 20- 25 min minutes.|`|3PfkXTouaa	you should try ethnic food. like japanese, italian, or chinese. all is good you should try very nasty looking food but then it taste good like calamari. yum.

x2cXYousaa	Basic Caramel Sauce     ? c. white sugar     ? c. brown sugar     ? c. heavy cream     ? c. butter       In a smaller saucepan, combine all four ingredients and bring to a boil. Do not overcook. See tip above. Cook only to a softball stage and use a candy thermometer for best results. Remove from heat and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Cool and serve with whipped cream on your favorite dessert or ice cream sundae        ENJOY,  MAR|`|NeTNnvSZaa	The only thing you can do with cubes is melt them in the micro until they soften up but they'll get hard again when they cool down.    Making caramel is easy, you just cook some sugar in a non-stick skillet (no thermometer needed) until it browns and liquifies.  You'll know by the color when you have it right.  Just don't stir it much.    Yes the sugar crystals will melt right into brown gooey caramel.  If you want them to maintain their softness add a small amount of lemon juice, right at the end.|`|DIxbib1paa	120g (4 oz) light brown sugar   120g (4 oz) butter   100ml cream or full cream milk     1. Melt the butter and sugar in a saucepan over a low heat until the sugar is dissolved but not burned.   2. Stir in the cream or milk and heat gently until bubbling, stirring continually. Remove from heat and serve warm.    Thumbs down for that answer? 'making caramel from scratch is not an option,' lazy, lazy, lazy.

Its typical on some people who what to loose wait, instead of following a regime. Sorry but its the truth."    --- Thank you for your uncoordinated, incohesive piece of backlash. Have you even researched the flip side of your argument on google? While you're at it, look up "loose" in a dictionary (God forbid I just set my weight loose! It might get the best of me)... And "wait" in this context is in fact "weight".      To answer the question, sure it's possible why not? You'll actually find it a lot harder going back to meat after being a vegetarian, I assure you :P|`|2tcplDI4aa	actually it is highly possible for non-veg to veg or Viceversa .. a friend of mine was pure veg but now he prefer non-veg...    the change depends on u... u decide a reason for avoiding non-veg so that u will stick on to it... but u should strictly take more amount of vitamins and protein .. as from childhood your body would have been comfortable with non-veg u have to reduce taking non-veg gradually to avoid crisis of nutrition      all the best and congrats:):)|`|3SY0ObRQaa	Of course it is possible :]    Vegetarian and vegan diets are better for your health, the animals and the environment|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yep it's never too late.

Just make sure you are eating healthy and probably need a multivitamin.     Good luck!|`|AA11173395	Of course.  One can become vegetarian at any time.  Many people discover vegetarianism in middle age, in response to numerous health problems.    And don't worry about protein- it's in everything.  Heck, enzymes (found in raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds) ARE proteins.    If you consume enough calories, you're getting enough protein- the deficiency is generally seen only under famine-like conditions.|`|JrK1gmMPaa	Well I became a vegetarian after 14 years,so its possible.  As long as your commited to it you can do it!|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Certainly!  I was a complete omnivore until I was 24, and only transistioned into vegetarianism at 27.|`|4aYNKp2Xaa	It's possible, but you just have to be careful not to skimp on your protein.  Also, don't get caught in the trap I did when I tried becoming a vegetarian--eating too many carbs!  It's actually much less healthy than eating a balanced diet with meat.      Still, I think it's very possible to switch to vegetarianism.  Best of luck to you!    http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetar...|`|7E2kGw2naa	Yes, but while transitioning to a vegetarian diet some people feel a little bit sick for a while (maybe a week).    You should also read up on vegetarian nutrition.  I suggest "Becoming Vegetarian" by Brenda Davis.|`|4pco9j9Faa	It's completely possible and actually very common. I went vegan at age 14 (Actually I'm still 14) and that's kind of a great feat to, in my opinion.

Give vegetarianism a whirl, do your research, and watch PETA's video, meet your meat, to learn about slaughter houses. Good luck!!|`|AA12031316	Oh, sure it is. I was a complete omnivore until I went veggie in my early 30's.  What a HUGE difference it made to my health, too!  Get some books from the library, or research it on the internet.  Just make sure you eat a WELL BALANCED veggie diet, and you won't need any vitamins or supplements.  The whole protein thing is a bunch of hooey put out by the meat industry.  You can get plenty of adequate protein from non meat sources, such as beans, pulses, legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds, etc, as well as getting B12 and iron from non meat sources.  Good luck-I feel sure you will feel better for the change.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I know people who have become vegetarian in their fifties.|`|mzhETLVDaa	There are more advantages in proteins in meat than only veggies.

Pour the batter into the skillet, and after small bubbles form around the edges, it's time to turn the pancake. You can peek under the edge to see if it's ready yet.    I turn the oven to "Warm," which is about 150F and put a plate in there. As the pancakes are done, I transfer them to the heated plate. When the last pancake is added to the serving plate, I flip the whole pile over, so that the oldest and most-moist ones are on the top. (The plate does get a little sweaty - that's why I do it)    Oven warming doesn't make them tough at all. I heat the plates we're going to eat from as well, so that our breakfast stays warm.
ZNbauLJzaa	You may be making them too thick.  After pouring some batter in the pan, pick it up and swirl it around a bit so the batter spreads out thinner.  Also, try putting the heat down a little, don't cook the pancakes on real high heat.    Hope this helps.|`|PPaBFIpGaa	I've used this recipe (http://www.helium.com/items/1274717-how-... and it turns out great, even though it doesn't call for buttermilk. I stopped making buttermilk pancakes because I usually don't have that kind of milk on hand...I would have to say that your heat is probably too hot. The batter is also probably too thick.|`|nOVSf06Raa	Mixing everything well is key to a good batter ,first of all you need to beat your eggs after each addition you need to beat the batter well to create air bubbles ,don't' forget to add some baking powder and a bit of oil to the batter.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef from Canada and worked in Japan, and it is one thing that is very veggie friendly, I use to use pickled veg, pickled ginger, plum paste and even cooked beans, in Japan they will use seaweed and sometimes pickled cherry leaves to wrap them in.

The egg holds them together and the oil gives a clean release.

You don't need to buy either, though. Homemade ones are really easy and taste way better. For pancakes, mix 1 cup flour (I use whole wheat because it's healthier, but you can use regular unbleached if you like), 1 egg, 1 tbsp oil, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp sugar, and 3/4 cup milk. Mix it all up and cook your pancakes. I don't have a recipe memorized for waffles, but google "easy waffle recipe" and you'll get a bunch of them.

Use  1 tsp bleach for every gallon of water.    3)  Avoid cross contamination.  For example, don't cut lettuce on the same cutting board you just chopped raw chicken on.    4)  Sanitize all utensils prior to use.  A dishwashing machine is good for this.  If you don't have one, wash and then dip the utensils in a sanitation solution for 30 seconds.  Air dry.

I use a 1/2 cup measuring cup ( a little over heaping) usually 3 of these. After I put it into the rice cooker I rinse the rice three times.    There should be lines on the inside of the rice bowl to tell you how high to fill it.... so if you have 3 servings in there, fill it to the 3 line.  Add a tsp of olive oil.    That should help, mine hardly ever sticks anymore.
jVBjKxpyaa	Of course they are! Especially Redbull! Don't be fooled when someone says "Energy drinks are good for kids". They have alot of caffeine in them; Really bad for the heart.|`|NsYIUu3caa	they are harmful when you drink them in excess.  the combination of caffeine, ginseng, guarana, and whatever else they put in their when abused can put a strain on your heart, considering that those mentioned act as a stimulant and increase your heart rate.  as long as you don't go overboard on them it's really the same as a very strong cup of coffee in my opinion.  just beware the energy crash later in the day|`|k9xpO8WGaa	I wrote a paper on the subject, here's a page of my writing that should give you a bit of insight.    "The biggest factor that these people are interested in is the energy-giving elements of the drinks. Monster energy contains 2000mg of Taurine in a 16 ounce can. Taurine is a sulfonic acid that was discovered in the 1820s. The FDA currently has no nutritional information on Taurine, but it has prohibited Taurine sales in the past due to certain companies using the direct animal derivative version of Tauirine in their products.  The other main concern about Monster Energy is its ambiguous energy blend. Monster contains 5000mg of a mixture of L-Carnitine, Glucose, Caffeine, Guarana, Inositol, Glucuronolactone, and Maltodextrin, which they collectively term as their energy blend. A few of these chemicals are familiarGlucose and Caffeine--- but otherwise these chemicals are unknown to the general public. Inositol is food additives that dont have a huge effect on the end product, but Guarana, L-Carnitine, and Glucuronolactone have direct effects on the body.   Guarana is a chemical with five times the caffeine content of coffee, and it has been deemed GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA. Maltodextrin is a complex carbohydrate, but is unique in that it can be digested as fast as sucrose (table sugar). It is useful in providing energy extremely quickly, and starts working before the caffeine and taurine in Monster. L-Carnitine is a food additive that acts as a glucose disposer and contributes to high metabolism. It has also been used in trials to see its effects on dieting, diabetes, and male infertility. Glucuronolactone is another addictive chemical in Monsters energy blend. This chemical helps to fight the fatigue felt in a caffeine crash as well as create a euphoric feeling of well being."|`|ZMc3nkI6aa	They are bad for ur heart. one once in a while is ok but be warned ENERGY DRINKS ARE ADDICTIVE!! trust me i am addicted to Mountain Blast Powerade|`|QMAqzpKEaa	well these energy drinks are nothing but caffiene With a PUNCH of side doses of alot of other type of stimulants (e.g. Taurine, yellow 5) even though yellow 5 has yet not been proven harmful but studies suggest that it relates to impotency in the long run, but then again there haven't been very extensive research on this......    The burst of energy comes primarily from caffeine, but energy drinks are also loaded with sugar. Sugar comes in the form of glucuronolactone, sucrose, and glucose. Some drinks also contain an extract from guarana seeds which works to stimulate the central nervous system in a fashion similar to the way caffeine stimulates the body. Guarana seeds also have thermogenic properties, which increase the body?s metabolism through the generation of heat.    A soft drink usually has 19 to 25 grams of sugar in each eight-ounce serving. Energy drinks on average contain more than this. Red Bull, for example, contains 27 grams of sugar per serving of 250 milliliters (a little over eight ounces). This can be very dangerous, for an overload of sugar can lead to gastric emptying. The body becomes dehydrated, which prevents metabolized sugar from entering the bloodstream. This often results in nausea and vomiting.    energy drinks are like everything else, they're addictive obviously for their attention boosting value, but in the long run i don't think all of that caffiene is doing you any good, especially when caffiene stimulates ur circulatory system and affects the heart and makes it pump faster......because of energy boost.....    from personal experience, i wouldn't overdo it cuz i once passed out jittering because I had 2 rockstars within the span of 3 hrs.......and i'm a big guy, trust me.......and nobody REALLY knows what these ingredients are capable of long term, so i'd do anything in moderation......because u don't wanna b the reason they find out what energy drinks do to our system over a period of time.......    And no have energy drinks after alcohol is not the solution, because only some energy drinks have ingredients that will stimulate ur CNS so you can concentrate better mentally, u might get physically faster than if you were plastered but there will be no change in ur impairment due to alcohol......|`|AXAyuFW8aa	I am not sure what makes them harmful for you body. all i know is that they dont leave you in good shape.
WS9tmodsaa	Bake the two cakes, then stack them on eachother.|`|MF2nCqAZaa	To make a marble cake you make both batters seperately and then add white on one side and chocolate on the other (thing ying and yang). Use a kife to slowly swirl the edges together. You can even add drops of chocolate on white or vice versa and then swirl it together. DO NOT MIX. Bake as directed and you should have a marble cake.|`|5t6WpvYdaa	make the dark cake mix first according to directions.  put in cake pan.  the make the yellow cake mix.  spoon the yellow mix and spoon into the dark cake batter and make swirling motions.  you will need an xtra large cake pan for all this.  bake as directed.|`|0zRg4dxoaa	FIRST MIX BOTH CAKES THEN PUT IN PANS AND SAFE A LITTLE FROM EACH BATTER, SO MARBLZE EACH CAKE PAN,BAKE AND MAKE A 8 LAYER CAKE, LET CAKES COOL THEN SLICE IN HALF EACH CAKE . MAKE  FROSTING THEN FROST  EACH LAYER,AND STACK, TOP WITH RASPBERRIES,NAMASTE|`|UoWZaQG8aa	The problem though is that for a marble cake you usually only use 1/4 to 1/3 as much dark cake mix as light cake mix so you will probably end up with a brown cake if you mix the two together.    Alternatively, if you want to get creative with it, you could make a checerboard cake.  Here's how to do it (yes, i know the picture shows a round cake, but it's the same idea with a square one) ..... http://www.wilton.com/recipe/Checkerboar...|`|JTu1cLkYaa	You could also mix up both cake batters. Pour a little of the chocolate into the bottom of the pan, pour a little of the yellow batter on top, do not mix and top it off with the chocolate. Then reverse the color in the other pan.     Another idea, though it involves a little more work, but makes for an interesting cake.  Cut pieces of thin cardboard and cover them with aluminum foil, then you can bend and arrange them in the cake pan to make separate sections in various shapes. Pour the chocolate batter into some of the sections and the yellow batter into the rest. You will have to pour just a little of each color in first so the cardboard won't slip, then fill up the forms afterward. Gently pull the boards straight up so as not the mix the batters very much, and bake. When you cut into it you will have sections of chocolate and yellow cake.|`|RYVKYYnAaa	bake the two cakes separately by following the directions on the box, then once they are both finished baking, stack them on top of each other.|`|B1ueclBaaa	First - calm down!!!!

Ku0eacfhaa	What does kobe beef taste like?  HEAVEN on a fork (or chopsticks, whatever!).  Truly some of the most delicious beef you will ever encounter, so long as it is prepared properly.  Kobe beef is from Wagyu cows, intially raised in the Kobe region of Japan. Of course, there are several American ranches that now breed Wagyu cows.  The beef is is well marbled, and the cows live a pretty happy life.  They are massaged daily with sake and fed beer (among other things, of course), which make them extraordinarily tender.    As far as where to get it...  Are you looking for a resturaunt that serves kobe beef, or wanting to purchase some to prepare?  What city are you in?  Here in the DFW metroplex, there are several resturaunts that serve Kobe beef (Kobe's--probably the most economical option, Tei Tei Robata Bar, Kobeya in Southlake).      To buy and prepare it yourself...  Your best option is probably to buy it online.  See http://gourmetfood.about.com/od/kobebeef...  I've also bought from www.heartbrandbeef.com.  They sell one variety of Wagyu (Akaushi)--their beef is excellent and ships well.|`|SQxiGhz5aa	You can buy them online at Lobels.  The American version, anyway.  It is wagyu.  Link is below.  http://www.lobels.com/store/main/wagyuma...    How does it taste?    WONDERFUL!  It tastes buttery and tender.  It must be prepared properly.  The fat will melt from the touch of your hand.  These need to be cooked to only rare, you might get away with med rare, but the fat will melt quickly and you loose the purpose of the steak entirely.  If overcooked, the steak will be chewy and you wasted your money on this expensive delicacy!!

FbykwFypaa	Chilli has got a molecule in it called capsaicin, and capsaicin locks onto a certain channel on the surface of nerve fibres in the mouth and all over the body that signal pain. When the capsaicin molecule from the chilli locks on to that nerve fibre, it activates the nerve. The same nerve fibres also signal temperature, so it fools the nervous system in to thinking that you're hotter than you are. This causes a heat reaction and is why you often get sweaty.

GRmkXkAVaa	I made buffalo wings last weekend and I highly recommend this recipe. You may use boneless chicken as well or wing sections. I got rave reviews and they are better than any restaurant version I've tried. They come out crispy and just the right amount of heat.     It's from Recipezaar and it's the Hooters recipe. Excellent!!    Ingredients:  1/4 cup butter   1/4 cup louisiana hot sauce   1 dash pepper, Ground   1 dash garlic powder   1/2 cup flour   1/4 teaspoon paprika   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper   1/4 teaspoon salt   10 chicken wings   bleu cheese salad dressing   celery   vegetable oil, for frying     Directions  1. Combine the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.     2. If the wings are frozen, be sure to defrost and dry them.     3. Put the wings into a large bowl and sprinkle the flour mixture over them, coating each wing evenly.     4. Put the wings in the refrigerator for 60 to 90 minutes. (This will help the breading to stick to the wings when fried.)     5. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees.     6. You want just enough oil to cover the wings entirely -- an inch or so deep at least. Combine the butter, hot sauce, ground pepper, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Heat until the butter is melted and the ingredients are well blended.     7. Put all the wings into the hot oil and fry them for 10 to 15 minutes or until some parts of the wings begin to turn dark brown.     8. Remove the wings from the oil to a paper towel to drain.     9. But don't let them sit too long, because you want to serve the wings hot. Quickly put the wings into a large bowl.     10. Add the hot sauce and stir, coating all the wings evenly.     11. You could also use a large plastic container with a lid for this.     12. Put all the wings inside the container, add the sauce, put on the lid, then shake. Serve with Bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks on the side.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Well you can brine the chicken with the seasoning. Then bread and fry..

Place the chicken in a shallow baking pan and sprinkle with the chopped green onions. Mix the pineapple juice and candied ginger and pour over all. Bake, uncovered, in a 375 oven for about 45 to 55 minutes, or until chicken is done. Baste with juices several times.

Put the breasts and about 1/4 cup of white flour in a ziploc bag  2.  Seal the bag and shake until the chicken in evenly coated and dry  3.  Pan fry the breasts on medium heat with about 1 Tbsp of Olive Oil until chicken is done (about 5 minutes, 165 degrees F)    From there, you can get creative.  I am guessing a white sauce served over the top would go over well (see references for a recipe from FoodNetwork.com)    For sides, I would go with a standard salad with Italian dressing and dinner rolls.  Enjoy.|`|k1WdRqtgaa	This is SO good, and really not radical, and not difficult at all.  A very comforting food, too.  I made it a few night ago, and served it with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans.    It's essentially Texas-style chicken fried steak, but it is made with chicken breasts. Be sure to make this with the cream gravy.    CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN with CREAM GRAVY        * 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts      * 1 egg      * 1/2 cup milk      * 1 to 2 cups all-purpose flour      * cooking oil      * 1/2 teaspoon salt      * 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper      * 1/4 teaspoon paprika      * 1/4 teaspoon white pepper    Beat together the egg and milk and set aside. Mix together the salt, black pepper, paprika and white pepper and sprinkle on both sides of chicken breasts.    (You're going to get messy hands doing this next step, I try to use just one hand so I have a hand free to turn on the water to wash afterwards.)    Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour, shaking off the excess. Then dip each piece in the egg/milk mixture, then back in the flour.  Set chicken pieces aside on a piece of waxed paper.    Heat the cooking oil in a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over medium-high heat for a few minutes. Oil should be about a half-inch deep in the pan. and is ready when you add a drop of water in it and it  pops and spits :)    With a long-handled fork, carefully place each chicken breast into the hot oil. (Be VERY careful as the hot oil may splatter!)   Fry the chicken breasts on both sides, turning once, until golden brown. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook 15 to 18 minutes until chicken pieces are done through. Drain on paper towels.    CREAM GRAVY    After the chicken is removed from the pan, pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of oil, keeping as many as possible of the browned bits in the pan. Heat the oil over medium heat until hot.    Sprinkle 3 tablespoons flour in the hot oil. Stir with a wooden spoon, quickly, to brown the flour.    Gradually stir in 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup water, mixed together, stirring constantly with the wooden spoon and mashing out any lumps. Lower heat, and gravy will begin to thicken. Continue cooking and stirring a few minutes until gravy reaches desired consistency. Check seasonings and add more salt and pepper according to your taste.    Cream gravy is supposed to be thick, but if it's too thick for your taste, add more liquid until you're satisfied with it.|`|INPrlW6Maa	I mix cream of chicken soup with salsa and a little white wine.

In other supermarkets, there're Sanitarium and other products in the freezers and fridge sections near cheeses and smallgoods - sausages, schnitzels, burgers, mince, etc etc|`|z4wVHqZvaa	most grocery stores, check the freezer section|`|zzl1t5ycaa	The where question has been well answered I judge so I just have an aside.    I do not care for mushrooms.  I have a friend that grows organic mushrooms for the up scale restaurants in my area.  One day he an my room mate were eating dinner when I got home from work.  They offered me dinner and I sat down to eat.  Half way through the meal I asked where the mushrooms were.  They both laughed and told me the chicken I was eating was a mushroom.  It looked, smelled, tasted and even cut like a chicken breast so I had some trouble believing them.  I put a piece on the ground for my dog who sniffed it and walked away.  The mushroom is called 'Chicken of the woods' and is the best faux chicken I have ever encountered.  It blows the tofu stuff out of the water.  So now that you know where to look, I hope this is the what to look for.
