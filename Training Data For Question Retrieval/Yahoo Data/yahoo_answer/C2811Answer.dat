W0hNoMSsaa	Some people are clueless or just stingy. I always tip generously because waiting on tables is hard work, and I know that servers rely on tips for most, if not all, of their income.<br>  <br>  If people don't understand this concept or don't believe in it, then they should stick to fast food places or stay home. Instead they go to nice restaurants and stiff the server just to make a point that they don't believe in tipping. That is incredibly tacky.|`|MJvL013yaa	Wow, people actually believe that a tip is extra. How would they like it if their pay got docked for forgetting something small?<br>  People also think it is not their responsibility to tip, that servers get paid enough. <br>  I am a server. you would seriously have to give some crappyass service to get a bad tip from me.|`|84Z0QS2zaa	I leave only a small tip for bad service and try to let them know what I found wrong without being rude about it. Otherwise they think the small tip was because I was cheap rather than it being I never got a refill on my coffee. <br>  <br>  If service is good I tip  15 to 20%. I've always wondered just what the average pay is for waiting tables. There are other jobs where people provide a service and aren't paid much but seldom get tips. How many people ever leave a tip for a motel maid?|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	People are cheap and self centered.<br>  As a server you have to get a 6th sence about who will stiff you. And put your top energy elsewhere.<br>  <br>  If you have been stiffed by someone before, and you recognize them, you could do the math for them on the ticket, but you have to be brave and playful.<br>  <br>  Write a cute-sy note, for example on a 50$ ticket...<br>  "Working hard to keep you happy! How was service today? Gratutity levels: <br>  :(  = $0<br>  :/  = $5<br>  :)  = $7<br>  :D = $10<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|0dGwTbc1aa	The reason some people believe $2 is a good tip is that they see the server at their table maybe 10-20% of the time... lets assume for argument 20% of the time.  Assume most people think that they will be dining  for about an hour or so. So doing this math, they might believe that the waitress is serving 4 other tables and earning a $2 tip at those tables as well, so with base pay of $2 to $3 plus 5 tables tipping $2 she is earning $12 to $13 an hour... not too bad.             You know, however that it rarely works that way.  There are a lot of deadbeat tippers, plus the amounts you divvy with the buss-er and others.  And then there are the off-peak times when hardly anyone is dining. <br>  <br>  Myself?  I try to tip $1 for BAD service, 10% for poor service, 15% for average service 20+% excellent service.  I use coupons a lot and realize that the tip should be based on the amount before taking off the coupon discount.|`|aUa0LW9xaa	They are selfish. If they can afford to go out to eat and be waited on then they can afford to give a good tip. I always tip even if I have bad service. I'm sure they know its not a good tip they just don't care.|`|V8ErN4Vqaa	im not sure. my mom always pays the full amount of tips.<br>  shes good at that.<br>  sometimes if the person looks worried or tired she gives them more :D|`|uFDvCo3haa	they are *** holes|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'm not a server, never was, so it actually comes as a surprise to me that people actually don't tip or tip such a small amount.<br>  <br>  I don't know why people would do this, other than either being really cheap or really ignorant like the person who said a tip isn't guarenteed and you should be happy to get anything.  I mean, I know that servers get paid very little and rely on their tips for their pay.  For the people who think that tips are optional, I'd like to see their reaction if their boss decided to keep part of their pay, and just said to them that their full pay was optional.<br>  <br>  As for people who think $2 is a good tip, meh, I dunno.  $2 is my minimum tip, and thats only if I go out to breakfast by myself and the bill is like $7.  Even if my bill was $15, I'd likely tip $4-5, since usually I'd be around 15-20%, but if my bill was so low, its probably because I'm dining alone, but that doesn't mean the waitress is doing less work, since she's still waiting on my table, so I usually increase the tip in those situations to compensate for them not having a full table.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	First, people are cheap and ignortant and you just gotta take the bad with the good.
tzrLDbHWaa	Its fast food.  Its cheap, you get it quickly, and can eat it on the run.  Would I rather eat at Olive Garden or Outback, absolutely, but thats also more expensive and takes more time, from ordering to getting your food, and eating it.  McDonalds is tasty food for cheap.  I mean, you can go through the drive through and get it within a few minutes, without losing much time and without even getting out of your car.<br>  <br>  Its not about people saying McDonalds is the best thing ever, its about a quick meal that you can get on the run and for an affordable price.  Its that simple.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Truth be told, I ate at McDonald's last year because over at my city of Sacramento the restaurant had a grand re-opening and they featured a dollar menu so after seven years of not eating there I decided to take a gander and try it out. And the fillet-o-fish sandwiches were very tasty. I enjoyed eating the stuff! Also I ate there because I was so sick and tired of the McDonald's bashing from filmmaker Morgan Spurlock and environmental groups that I decided to wonder what the McDonald's bashing is all about.|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	I don't like a lot of fast-food EXCEPT McDonald's. I know the food is absolutely disgusting, soaked in grease and oil and probably rolled over the floor a couple of times but it tastes so so good. If I am going to be unhealthy I might as well go all out because I don't do it that often. I think it is silly when people go out for fast food and have a salad. Who are you kidding? Your out for fast food, why would you want leaves? Most people don't know they are even worse than what would be more tasty. I like McDonald's because of the taste of the food. I can, however, surely state that if I ate there more than once a month my opinion would be changed. It is the perfect treat food.|`|L2jPYlbdaa	The salads aren't bad if you get the dressing on the side, which is how it's served.  Pour the dressing out onto the lid and just dip your fork into it rather than coating all the vegetables with it.  You'll save a lot of fat and calories from going into your body.  Also get one of the salads like the Asian or Southwest one that doesn't have tons of bacon and cheese on it and get the grilled chicken and not fried.<br>  The fruit & walnut salad & fruit and yogurt parfait aren't bad, either.<br>  <br>  As far as the junky food, my favorite is a plain double cheeseburger, no meat.  I LOVE their cheese, but hate the beef there.  A McChicken is good, too.  I get it with mayo on the side.|`|Hvhynlftaa	Its cheap, Tasty, and not healthey!|`|a2134372f454ba425d7b423ac42d1ed2aa	The customer puts the dressing on...|`|nzWux9Meaa	I used to love McDonalds and usually ate there weekly until I got a job there. They don't wash thier hands, they drop food and still use it, they sneeze on their hands and don't wash them, and finally they always use expired foods. When I say they always use expired foods I mean for example when a fried product has expired they RESET the timer which puts another half an hour on the experation clock. This means that whoever gets that sandwich, unknowingly, has to eat an expired food product which could be a health hazard. Now that I have to smell that place I can not stand any types of fried products.|`|Ls6qQgcaaa	personaly i dont like mcdonals at all! all of there food is filled with calories and that is actually energy but what ppl do is they dont exersize and that energy that is not used is then stored as fat. i am very active and even though i still dont like it because there food is disgusting in my opinion.|`|7g7goXTyaa	It's cheap, tasty, and you get it quickly.<br>  Also some people like that it's consistent no matter where you buy it.|`|NAMrOZRiaa	Meh its ok, the healthiest thing you can eat there is the toy's you get from the happy meals i bet<br>  <br>  baha|`|U286XG21aa	McDonalds is nasty period...|`|pA1M2HSoaa	because its freaking DELICIOUS!!! and i dont see why all you stuck up people cant just let go and admit you like it. gosh|`|l7IdlcHSaa	i do but i hate there burgers|`|EGiIcGOiaa	i like there fries and wraps|`|44bbygADaa	I like McDonalds,  because the burgers and fries are really good.  Also I like their chicken nuggets, milkshakes, apple pie, oreo mcflurry and their ceaser salad.   <br>  I know the stuff isn't good for you, but I have been eating McDonalds since my 1st birthday, and i'm now 19.  So I can't give the stuff up.  And no, i don't order all that food all at once.  I usually switch it up everytime I go there.|`|zpz3kMiSaa	Err. McDonald's doesn't put ANY dressing on their salads. They give the customer their own dressing so they choose the amount of dressing. McSalad Shakers were out like 5 years ago, bro.<br>  <br>  The $1.00 side salad that comes with almonds and Newman's own Asian dressing is good, and pretty healthy from what I understand, as that dressing is one of the healthiest they have on their menu.<br>  <br>  I'm a vegitarian, so I kind of resent the fact that McDonald's hasn't developed its own or mass contracted a company for the sale of veggie burgers, like Burger King has, but still, I'm not going to talk smack about McDonald's because people can eat whatever they want. Last time I checked, this is America.<br>  <br>  Although The Messiah King Obama of Kenya was elected, so perhaps he'll vanquish McDonald's and put us all on pineapple smoothies and force us to spit-roast fetuses.... I mean, he IS Pro-Infanticide... Just look at his voting record when he was in the Illinois State Senate...<br>  <br>  I was personally against him, but apparently America wanted him. So enjoy the prolonged recession!!!|`|R3SZ2hT4aa	the fruit and walnut salad,apple dippers with lo cal caramel and skim milk lattes(choose splenda to sweeten,or sugar-free vanilla syrup)are not bad.it all depends what u choose.i stick to the things i just mentioned.|`|AA10346866	I only like mcdonalds crispy chicken wrap with ranch dressing all of their burgers to me are dry and when i do eat breakfast there i get the steak egg and cheese bagel combo i dont eat breakfast there often.|`|uFDvCo3haa	rfykujfhk|`|cMRphaJfaa	I dont think they are the greatest, but I do like their wraps and mcribs. thats about all I like from them.|`|0m8ZVd9Uaa	i hate that place..........the fries are so gross. and everything else is.
L2jPYlbdaa	Probably the salad bar.  It's all you can eat, too.  It has stuff for salads, a taco bar, chicken wings, ice cream, soups, and breads.  Less than $10.<br>  The rest of the food isn't very good in my opinion. Service is average.

Outback easily.<br>  <br>  Outback has very good quality food at a reasonable price.  I mean, if you don't want to spend a lot, you can always go with the 6 oz steak for 9.99 and you can make one of your sides a soup and pretty much have a full meal.  I usually get the cheesecake olivia for dessert and its like 2.99, cheaper and a lot higher quality than a scoop of ice cream.<br>  <br>  Friendly's, in my opinion, is extremely overpriced for what they offer.  The quality of food is nowhere near that of Outback, and, to be honest, I've never once ever had good service in a Friendlys.  Part of it may be that the waitresses are overworked, since I've usually seen very few waitresses there, and on top of it they have to make their own ice cream, so they're probably busier, but part of the "going out" experience is getting good service.  I've ALWAYS gotten exceptional service at Outback and ALWAYS gotten piss poor service at Friendly's, and thats any Friendly's I've been to.  <br>  <br>  In the end, better service and better food, as well as a cleaner and more sophisticated enviornment, for a similar price, make Outback the clear choice.|`|UbXVjcm7aa	I found a pubic  hair in my ice cream sundae last time I went to Friendlys (no lie!) so I will never set foot in one of them again.

8XJiIoqyaa	No, it was a limited time promotion, because the McDonald's advertising and marketing team was trying to ratchet up interest in the new product (no matter that they don't taste very good at all) and steal market share from latte-centric companies like Starbucks and Caribou and Seattle's Best.<br>  <br>  I haven't heard that they were doing that since early January, so it must have ended a while ago.|`|uFDvCo3haa	nope|`|pueeMH6gaa	Bad news: nothing free.<br>  Good news: the lattes taste like lukewarm dishwater.|`|pg5AHNcdaa	they do around here.

c17199eb79fdfa86b8b288278f541079aa	i think you should skip the bacon and "light" mayo and diet soda and chips.. and switch to wheat bread instead of white if you don't use wheat already|`|E7TkNO00aa	It's healthy food in a way, but why not try substituting the salami, and bacon with another topping like bell peppers and cheese? The diet Dr. Pepper seems okay, but why not try lemonade if it is available. Good luck.|`|84Z0QS2zaa	Although, I don't really care for Subway myself I love sandwiches. I think that you can eat any sandwich and not have it be unhealthy if you balance out the amount of fat and sodium, especially fat that you eat on the days that you buy a sandwich at Subway. That can be hard to if you don't know what the nutritional content is of the food you're eating.<br>  <br>  While your choice may not be called healthy it is healthier than others you could make.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing/food-manufacturing/645768-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing...</a><br>  One key to Baked Lay's success is its label declaration, In terms of calories, it's not much better than fried potato chips - 110 per serving, vs. about 150. But fried chips have about 10 grams of total fat per serving and 1.5 saturated fat; Baked Lay's features 1.5 grams total fat and no saturated fat. <br>  <br>  16 oz regular soda 200 calories. Diet soda 0 calories<br>  <br>  Yeah, salami is fattier and you'd really have to cut out saturated fat on your other food choices for that day but eating just turkey or chicken all the time gets old.

So, enjoy just don't live on this type of food.|`|L2jPYlbdaa	Salami is a really fatty lunch meat and their bacon is loaded with sodium and nitrates.  I would get turkey, ham, or roast beef instead.  Also opt for more fresh veggies, because pickles and the jalapenos they use are from a can, which adds even more salt to your food.|`|2hMhANqDaa	the bacon isn't healthy.

accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	Well if you are looking for Jewish foods, the lower east side is still a lot like it used to be.  I would suggest Yuna (sp) Schimel's Kinish shop on Houston St. going down towards Delancy Street.  There are still those stores, also Russ and Daughters on I think Houston and Orchard and Katz's Deli, the Deli used in when Sally met Harry, or whatever.  And there are some old fashioned penny candy stores that aren't a penny any more, that also have dried fruit.<br>  Unfortunatly the 2nd Ave Deli is no longer around. The owner was shot and his brother didn't want to keep it open as the rent went too <br>  high.<br>  Chinatown and Little Italy are still where they always were, even though Chinatown is sort of moving across into Little Italy.  Just head down Canal Street going towards Brooklyn and right before you get to Brooklyn you will find the 2 areas.<br>  The Carnegie Deli is still on 7th Ave in the 50;s.<br>  They don't take credit cards and they are very over priced but worth it, so bring cash, a lot of cash.  Still the best deli in town.<br>  For Pizza there is the Original Ray's, oh so many of them, but the real one is on 6th Ave and I believe 11th street.  If you want a whole pizza and to sit down the BEST pizza is John's on Bleeker Street, over by MacDougal Street.<br>  Head over to the other end of Bleeker Street, heading North towards 8th Avenue for the best cupcakes (and cakes and other goodies) and you will find the Magnolia Bakery.  I believe they mention it in a lot of TV shows.  Not cheap, but all you need is one cup cake and you have a sugar overload.  Really worth it.  They have a few seats, or you can eat your cup cake as you walk around.  Marc Jacobs has stores on the same street.  I just know it's on Bleeker, towards the end of the street before it becomes <br>  8th Avenue.  Wear good shoes.<br>  For bagels, the best are on the upper west side at H&H Bagel.  You can go right next door to Zabar's to get Nova or whatever you want to put on your bagel.  Zabar's is huge, but it's always crowded, that's why I send my husband, even though I live a few blocks from there.<br>  For theater we still have Duffy Square, or TDF, whatever it's called at 7th ave and 47th St. where you can get 1/2 price seats, but I think the lines are still long.  You might want to try and get tickets before you come as there are 2 new shows opening now that are going to sell out, West Side Story and Billy Elliot.<br>  Italian food, great place to go, in the theater district and upper westside, Carmine's.  I don't know if you can make reservations and you may have a long wait, but everyone loves it.<br>  If you want to take a trip for Italian food, things haven't changed in the Bronx, Arthur Street is still the same as ever for the best Italian food and the biggest portions.<br>  East Village is the place for jewish pastry, a little further up, in the 20's I believe, the best Italian pastries are at Venieros.  There is a place in Little Italy that is a big glitzy dessert place that was probably around when you were around, but now it's really fancy.  Good for cappiccino, but Venieros is better for desserts.<br>  I'm sorry I can't spell that well.<br>  There is a great Greek restaurant up on 113th Street, it's full of people from Colmbia University and I drove past and it's still there.<br>  Ok, good restaurants, you should go to some of those:  Maze, the cheaper restaurant of Gordon Ramsay.  It is a tasting menu, so you get little portions or about 4 or 5 dishes, depending on if you want dessert.  My favorite restaurant in Manhattan. It is in the London Hotel.  You may have seen the show Hell's Kitchen, well, this is one of the restaurants that is already open. I totally love Capsuto Freres on Watts Street, Tribeca.  It is Lebenese/French.  I have taken a lot of friends there and everyone has loved it and all have been surprised at the cost.  The comment has been that it is so reasonable for such fantastic food.  City Hall Restaurant, Duane Street, American Food.   Atlantic Seafood Bar (?) not sure of the name but lex and 76th Street.  The Coffee Shop at I think 16th Street at the park, good for lunch, breakfast, brunch.  SaraBeth's, Upper east and west side, breakfast, brunch and lunch, Qest Broadway and 85th street, need a good lead time for reservations (American) Docks, seafood, go to the one uptown.  Le Bernadin 4 star seafood, but you can get reservations. Aquivit (Swedish I think)<br>  Well, I guess I've given you a lot to think about.<br>  Oh, deli - Abe's on upperwest side, Merea and Husband go there all the time.<br>  Have fun, subways and buses use plastic cards now. They are expensive. Sometimes easier to use a cab.|`|RxhBUkwSaa	NYC is BIG, but thankfully, there are good delis and great pizza everywhere!  Carnegie Deli is fun, but you probably don't have to pay so much, or deal with such crowds to get a great deli sandwich.<br>  <br>  About.com gives you a good start on finding great places in every neighborhood.  Here: <a href="http://gonyc.about.com" rel="nofollow">http://gonyc.about.com</a>  Your hotel concierge can probably be very helpful too.  NY Magazine's site does lots and lots of food items and is a great source too:  www.nymag.com  <br>  <br>  Little Italy is fun, and has some classic places for Italian pastries like Ferraro's, and pizza on every block... and delis too!  Don't be afraid to go into little places and see what they've got.  NYers love to eat!|`|jHoyOpTxaa	tony dinapolis is really good..its right around times square and tonys pizza is delish! in little italy ferraras has the best italian pastries!! have funn!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, first of all, you can't really get messed up with streets in NYC, because they're all numbered for the most part, so its fairly easy.<br>  <br>  As for delis, they're all over Manhattan, one of the most famous is the Carnegie Deli which is on 7th ave betweeen 54th and 55th.<br>  <br>  As for pizza and italian pastries, your best bet is to go to Little Italy, which is in lower manhattan, and you can find plenty of places there.

pbV7dnKKaa	Oh there are a ton of places you can eat on the strip. There are places that are inside the hotels and places that are directly outside. I liked Hard Rock Cafe. I found places by using an online yellow pages, they list all of the restaurants that are there to eat at like Ruth's Chirs Steak House at the Flamingo.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I've always been partial to the buffets, you get to choose what you eat, you can have a variety, and the food is usually very good.|`|nZmLycrXaa	Tao in the Venetian, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Caesar's, Pink Taco (off the strip) in the Hard Rock.<br>  <br>  What type of food do you like: steak, seafood, mexican, italian, etc.?|`|A7vs0Z4Uaa	tao <br>  go go go!|`|rqHKbubraa	Mesa Grill in Caesars Palace|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	the Voodoo lounge|`|raSr9PYhaa	you can go to strip steak It's hard to call one place the very best, but when you consider price, quality and service these restaurants are at the top of the list. Most are not too expensive and you will leave with a sense of fulfillment and an urge to return. Honestly, I cannot live without it. I don't know how. If you have visited Chinois in Santa Monica you will notice the absence of pretentiousness, what is not missing is the incredible food. When I think of a Las Vegas Restaurant to send my friends to, I almost always list Chinois. It has been remodeled, there is a new head chef and things are still incredible. Mix and match, a little sushi a little Kung Pau Chicken. A beer, some wine and some saki!|`|ZDYgzYzxaa	Visit the spice market buffet at planet hollywood's resort and casino. It features food stations from around the world. Mexican, Italian, Asian, Middle Eastern and American. They also have a desserts station that is to die for. You must go. It is the best buffet in the world!|`|0uTKr8Knaa	at the Rio (its not exactly on the strip) there is this really great BBQ place called Rub BBQ..they have excellent food<br>    <a href="http://www.rubbbq.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rubbbq.net/</a>
grRGlNWhaa	them: "welcome to subway, what can i get you?"<br>  you: "6 inch turkey on italian herbs and cheese please"<br>  them: "ok. what kind of cheese?"<br>  you; "american please"<br>  them; " anything else?"<br>  you: "lettuce, pickes, and light mayo"<br>  them: "anything else?"<br>  you; "id like the meal with it please."<br>  them: "what kind of drink/chips?"<br>  you: "baked lays and a dr. pepper please"<br>  them: "ok, that will be $6.34"<br>  .. and thats it :)<br>  best answer please?|`|AA11370645	You don't talk to the cashier initially, you talk to a person on the other end of a line. You basically tell that person:<br>  - I would like a (6" or 12") (type of sandwich) on (Italian/white, wheat, Italian herb and cheese, honey oat) bread.<br>  They ask you if you want cheese, and if you want it toasted. After this, it moves down the line to a section with cold toppings such as vegetables, mustard, mayonnaise, oil/vinegar, salad dressings, etc. You tell them what you want. The sandwich is then wrapped and cut, and passed on to the cashier. They will ring you up, and ask you if you want chips and a drink. You can also get cookies, juice, or apple slices.<br>  <br>  As far as a type of sandwich to get, I go with the Spicy Italian, which is pepperoni and salami. The Sweet Onion Chicken Teryaki is also good. I usually go with Italian (white) bread. I usually have them toast it, and I get different toppings depending on what I am in the mood for that day. Right now, they are running $5 footlongs again, which is an excellent deal.|`|4f2GaLhpaa	Well I would order a foot long ham & turkey on Italian herb with cheddar cheese. Then I would add the veggies, that one is just a personal preferance. Then get some baked lays and a chocolate milk. It's a great lunch I promise (:|`|UUJxZAfSaa	they have an online menu: <a href="http://www.subway.com/applications/Menu/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.subway.com/applications/Menu/...</a><br>  <br>  i like the chicken terriaki (6 inch sub) toasted with lettuce, olives, onions and sweet onion dressing|`|z7MPaUELaa	I love the meatball sub with mozzarella and tomato on italian herb bread.<br>  <br>  Great answer Fat Tay!|`|U286XG21aa	turkey sub with mayo... on white bread not tosted|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Its not rocket science.  You tell them what you want, and they make it.  They'll usually ask you which type of bread you want first, since thats what they start with, and also if its a 6" or a footlong, then you just tell them which sub you want.  Its very simple.|`|JWk1lKJgaa	for the beginner I would start with the footlong subway melt on monterey-chedder bread with the sprinkle cheese and have them toast it ok the monterey-chedder bread is white bread with cheese baked on top of it, its good. the subway melt is a layer of turkey, a layer of ham, and bacon. the good stuff. the sprinkle or shredded cheese is monterey jack and chedder cheese, toasting it melts the cheese into the meats.  then you pick you veggies lettuce,tomato, onion, peppers, or olives they have a picture of all the veggies. and last the dressing Mayo is a good Standard  chocolate milk to drink  you are in subway heaven|`|rm5Nt2VEaa	It's actually pretty simple.  I would suggest like someone else said check out the menu online.  Then when you get to Subway you will tell them first what type of sandwich you want (i usually order turkey and ham) and then on what type of bread (italian, wheat, italian herbs and cheese, honey oat etc)  and they will ask you what type of cheese if you want.  Then after that they will ask if you want your sub toasted (yes or no).  Then you will move down and tell them what vegetables you want and if you want any type of sauce.  Then you go to the register and pay.  If you'd like you can make it a combo with chips and a soda.<br>  <br>  Subway is amazing!|`|OkCrlU7Aaa	First you tell them what type of sandwich you want (ex: Turkey sub, tuna, spicy Italian etc and also if you want it footlong or 6inches)<br>  Then they ask you what type of bread you want it on (ex: wheat etc)<br>  Then they'll ask you what type of cheese you want on it.<br>  Then you tell them if you want it toasted or not. Sometimes they'll ask, sometimes they won't. <br>  Then you can pick what types of vege's you want in it and then the sauce.<br>  And you're done.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Usually it goes like this:<br>  You: Subway Club<br>  Idiot: Bread?<br>  You: Whole wheat<br>  Idiot: eirjif<br>  You: What?<br>  Idiot: eirojej<br>  You: Uh, okay.<br>  You: wait, no mustard.<br>  Idiot: I asked you if you wanted mustard and you said okay.<br>  You: I didn't understand you, you mumbling moron.<br>  Idiot: I'm calling the cops.|`|1m6i9oIgaa	I always order  Roast Beef Sandwich at Subway
