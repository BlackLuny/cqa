They will not let you re-download them for free even if you have already purchased them.  And if you have an iPod, and try to put all those songs back into iTunes so you have them on your computer, you will lose everything on your iPod.  The iPod only recognizes songs that are currently in your iTunes library, so if your computer crashes as mine has done, your screwed!

Currently the iPhone is scheduled to be released this summer, that is basically an iPod & cell mixed together, it will only be offered to Cingular (you might be able to unlock it and get T-Mobile service though) and the price is $499 (4GB) and $599 (8GB). So far this is the price with a 2 year contract, no rebates or anything, but it is still a while before it is released, so who knows maybe it will go down. The Chocolate is the one you probably want if you are going with Verizon, if you want to wait for the iPhone, and pay the price tag, then it will be until June or July, and Cingular service.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	It's a great cell phone.  Get a 2 gb micro SD card, and you got yourself a decent MP3 player.  The sounds could use a little improvement.  The songs aren't as clear as a true MP3 player, but it's good enough to be a portable music player.  The ring tone could also be louder.  You have to set it to the max if you don't want to miss any calls.  I've missed many calls when the volume was at 4.  The camera is pretty good for a cell phone.  It takes pretty clear pictures.<br>  <br>  I have Cingular as a carrier, and the problem is that there's quite a lot of dead air if you're not outside or near a window.|`|6UJtlkwsaa	I havnt had a problem with it.

raFYuWouaa	Yes you can and it is the correct thing to do . You did not specify what kind of microphone you have . There are some mics that really need a pre-amp which is what you were doing with the guitar amp . What kind of mic is it? give me the make and model. also use the trim on the console to boost the volume of the mic if you haven't tried that yet.

m9N4NVR6aa	I cant make it into an mp3, but I can tell you how to do it. <br>  <br>  First, simply search for the name of your song in youtube, and find a video of it. <br>  <br>  Next, go to this site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mediaconverter.org/" rel="nofollow">http://mediaconverter.org/</a><br>  <br>  Once here, click the second bullet, and paste the URL of the youtube video containing your song.

3CJAUyqPaa	If the camcorder does not have AV-in (or as you say, "doesnt have "TV in") capability, there is no cord, cable, or adapter that will change that - which means you can't do what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Since you did not tell us which camcorder manufacturer and model number, we have no way to know or check. And posting the camcorder model after the fact won't help - you need to post in a new question. Not my rule - Yahoo! Answer's rule.|`|nhYABprkaa	you need to get the adaptec gamebridge, and download the games you played to your PC, then burn to CD or DVD.<br>  <br>  Those things run from about $50 and up, you can also transfer videos to your computer too.|`|Q5wwb1vvaa	If you have no in on your camcorder then you will have to set it up on a tripod and film the television screen. Probably won't be the best quality but better than nothing.
ohq6qrFaaa	It's probably the power cord that connects the Zune to the PC. Maybe the bit that transfers power is broken? If it's not recognised by the Zune software but the Zune can tell it's plugged in, it might be a problem with the player. <br>  <br>  I would reccomend calling Microsoft to see if they know better.|`|Mboh3eVCaa	Was it working fine before and just stopped working?  To me that would sound like the cord has gone bad.   If you can, try plugging your Zune into a different USB port on your computer, occasionally that will work.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, make sure the port on your computer that you're plugging the Zune into is USB 2.0 (I'm pretty sure the Zune requires it, and you won't be able to charge through your computer without it).

It's 300 bucks and comes with a 60 gb hard drive, which should be plenty if you don't download a lot of demos and trailers.|`|OkTrJc9Saa	u should get the pro cause if u buy the arcade then you'll have to buy a hard drive anyway|`|7LSeuz2yaa	if you are not looking for anything too crazy...then you want the Pro set, it comes with a 60gb HDD (hard disk drive) that is going to be the best bet|`|5CiAFdbsaa	If I was you I'd get premium.
2uZivThaaa	For everything you only pay 99.99 since there is no additional mail in rebate listed. Also if you want the internet you would have to pay separately for the data package for the blackberry which usually runs around $30 per month. Other than that its your regular voice plan and any other features currently on your account (i.e. text messaging).
njyrsWS8aa	The LG Dare is awesome. I had the EnV before it, and really liked it, but the LG Dare surpasses it. Its easy to use, texting/IM is easy and the touch screen is very responsive. The music player is also easy to navigate. I suggest buying a microSD card with it as well, and you can have your music handy. The battery life is very good. The internet on it is user friendly. Any typing can easily be done with the QWERTY keyboard. You can create a slideshow of pictures as your background/wallpaper and there are 2 "themes" to choose from a back theme and white theme. You can also adjust your shortcuts menu to the tools you use most often. You're making a wise choice in getting this phone.|`|26zfOKYNaa	it has really good reviews so i would get it.  I recommend getting the vcast pak for 15 dollars a month which gives you unlimited internet and email usage.  enjoy!
epofQ8a0aa	It does. The mode you're thinking of is the 'color accent' mode, where you can choose to highlight one color in  the frame, and turn everything else black & white.|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	About the color accent option: it seems to be a current fad that people are getting excited about.<br>  The camera keeps one color and turns everything else black and white.<br>  <br>  I would never use such a feature for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  ? You are very limited in what you can do.<br>  ? The function isn't always reliable or accurate. The camera's idea of "red" might be different to yours. It will often include/exclude areas that don't want to be included/excluded.<br>  ? Imagine  if you just happened to take your best photo ever, but instead of having a real color photo, you only have some partial b&w thing that might look totally awful. You'd kick yourself.<br>  ? If you do the "Selective or Partial Desaturation" (as it is called correctly) in post processing, you have much more control over it, and will get a way better result. Plus you can keep your original color version, too.<br>  <br>  This also applies to any color effects done in camera like b&w or sepia - you're better off NOT to.<br>  <br>  If you don't have your own image editor, you can go to www.picnik.com and use their effects menu which makes it very easy.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	yes it does
mZlPj8Guaa	Usually they are Micro SD cards. I got mine at Staples. They were $12.99 for 4 Gig. Which I thought was resonable. It did not come with an adapter. But they are readily available. But my phone comes with a USB cord, so I can just upload or download the pictures or video I want.

To be fair, the vid does say the iPhone is a better phone, but everyone I know has one, and to be honest, they all give poor ratings, except for the Mac user in the group, go figure.  <br>  <br>  It all depends on what you want out of the phone, so watch the vid and enjoy. <br>  <br>  P.S.  I picked up a LG Vu, and if you an existing AT+T customer, goto wirefly.com and you can get a free Vu for free to.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|QvSEddFEaa	apple iphone, trust me. the other is a waste of money.
Wpulf29Maa	Hey Lover....I love you!!!
qWicVoU9aa	It is possible that you have pay per use features on the account that give you the capability to access the internet but it will charge you by the kb.  If you dio not plan on using the internet at all it would probably be best to call the service provider and have them remove any features you do not need and block them.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Unless you specifically ask for there to be no internet, you can connect, as there would be internet. Can you get pic messages? Then there is internet on your phone.You wouldn't get charged airtime, you get data and texting charges, depending on how you sign in. <br>  For sure texting costs. You get data if you opened the browser.<br>  <br>  Yes they can block it. If you block internet, you won't be able to get picture messages. But it can be blocked. Everything can be blocked, internet, messaging, downloading, everything.|`|EX24j1x3aa	your phone can still connect to the internet and you could be charged for it. If you closed out real quick tho, I don't think you got charged.
uctxzjIIaa	Gamecube's. The only thing that limited the graphics on the GC were the 1.5 GB disks, which sometimes resulted in washed-out textures. Just compare the two versions of RE4. Or PSO to PSU.|`|Hiasgb75aa	I'm pretty sure the Gamecube had better graphics. It's too bad the actual console sucked, while the PS2 is legendary despite being weak in graphics|`|HekFanRvaa	I don't think Gamecube can compete with the PS2 in terms of graphics and game titles. Nintendo has stopped making Gamecube already. The Wii has a built in Gamecube console.

My cousin has the VU, and while it was awesome at first, the keys rubbed off really easily, and she's gone through 3 of them because they also break really easily. (twice her screen just stopped working, another she dropped it.)
qWicVoU9aa	No it is not possible.  You would have to live in Maryland to get a Maryland number.  Or you would have to have lived there and moved to NJ and relocated your account but kept your old number
yO18jqI8aa	No, the media plan will only get you internet.  And besides if you are in a WiFi area, you will have internet anyways so no need for paying the extra fee a month.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Once the iphone is activated, the data plan goes on it. It's a non negotiable plan. You can't remove it.
4g7KvIAMaa	Personally I think a 24 month contact is probbaly a bad idea unless your getting an amzing free gift which you're not.<br>  <br>  Your link doesn't work either so we can't see the deal.

On my McAfee siteAdvisor it comes up saying the site is reliable and it should know the thing is very accurate looks good to me. But quality of service ie the delivery of items customer service i'm not sure but its safe to buy from
qWicVoU9aa	You would probably be better off going to eBay; Craigslist; or Amazon.com and purchasing one that has already been unlocked.  Otherwise you will have to purchase the device at full retail at the store and then try to get it unlocked after that and sometimes that is a hassle.|`|R90Su58raa	This site has great deals for all good quality phones, plus a free gifts section..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.comparemobs.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.comparemobs.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  you'll be able to buy individual phones from here too, they are the cheapest, I found.<br>  good luck with whatever you decide<br>  <br>  :D
fwnqB0dTaa	First thing you do is contact your service supplier and put a block on your number, and on the phone.<br>  <br>  After that it depends on if you have insurance or not.<br>  <br>  If you do you will get a new phone, there may be a small charge for this.<br>  <br>  If you don't then you need to buy a new phone, but they can supply a new SIM card on the old number, or configure the new phone that way if it they don't use SIMs.<br>  <br>  PS: Mikay is wrong, if you cancel the contract you will have to pay the early termination fee, which is normally the full cost from now until the end of the contract. Losing the phone makes no difference to this.<br>  <br>  PPS: What's with all the "call AT&T" answers, that's pointless if you aren't an AT&T customer.<br>  <br>  EDIT: As I said above, if you don't have insurance you have to pay full price for the new phone, but it can be set up on your old account.|`|AA12352550	I am not exactly sure. Call At&t NOW!!!!!|`|AA11603810	Call your service provider and have them turn the phone off.  Once you get a new phone, they can easily transfer your account to the new phone.. so no having to worry about getting a new number and such.|`|ke0dsgkkaa	If you've already called an no one answered, then call phone service now. Hopefully someone like me (found a blackberry) tracks you down and returns it. Phone company may be able to track it. They will know the answers you are asking.

e4hMIUGCaa	1. Using GPS is free.But if the map is online,like google map,you have to pay data connection.Bcoz the phone is using internet connection to access the map.<br>  2. Using " A-GPS" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-GPS" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-GPS</a>  will cost you money.Bcoz "aGPS" combine satellite signal and satellite information datas sent by your provider to your phone at anytime.The datas are sent through data connection.This data connection is the provider charges you for.Even if the map is offline,stored in your memory card/phone memory.Online map will cost you .<br>  3.

VSWl45cKaa	I have a SAMSUNG SCH-A576 and I have the same problem (and message) when hooking up to a computer. It happened on my laptop (running VISTA Home Premium) and my desktop running XP Professional). It even happens after I downloaded and installed 320 updates to the PC Studio 3 software, so I was confident that I had the latest version of the Studio 3 software. I also checked the 'Device Manager' (the phone is listed in the 'Modems' section) as well to see if the phone was detected as working properly and it was. <br>  <br>  I called the SAMSUNG Canada support line and I was walked through two modes on the USB settings - PC Studio and Mass Storage. When both modes gave the same result, I was told that I had done all I could over the phone and that I should take it to my wireless provider and have it sent in to be re-programmed. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you may have the same problem that I do. At least there seems to be an answer, even if it may be inconvenient.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

qWicVoU9aa	No you cannot.  T-mobile is GSM (uses SIM cards) and MetroPCS uses CDMA and the 2 are not even remotely compatible
w7Ffw6MYaa	I have the Slash, its a great phone. I can tell you that its a good quality phone because I dropped it a few times and it has been exposed to moisture and it still works; not that you should do that to your phone of course. Anyways, to answer your question. <br>  <br>  Yes, the instant messaging service does cost you money (as well as the e-mail service). The only charges you will get are standard messaging charges. If you plan to instant message, I highly recommend an unlimited messaging pack (i.m eats up a lot of messages). The application itself is free to download, you just got to pay standard messaging charges. There are NO web charges for using instant messaging. <br>  <br>  Also this phone has decent battery life unlike most of Virgin Mobile Phones. Its camera is OK, but not the greatest. Also its a slider phone and its pretty easy to slide up and down. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)
TmDabvoIaa	its not a bad set, apart from the cd players, one knock and they'll be jumpin and skippin all over the place!<br>  there's nothing wrong with cdj players, or those who use them :)<br>  most things you can do with vinyl can be done with top end cdj's these days. it'll be out of your price range but the pioneer cdj1000's are the bees knees.<br>  loud enough for a small hall/ big room.<br>  you should never have them at full bore, you should always keep some sound back to stop stupid distortion noises|`|etXYn0sCaa	For an out of the box job its not too bad - if your just starting out these are great, though the best kit is almost always sold separately, and putting a rig together from scratch is something you'll end up doing eventually. The other problem with it is the fact its CD mixers. Vinyl is always better-you can scratch, mix, juggle, and give people a real show. My advice is to get some real decks and persevere with learning to use them well -its harder than using a CD mixer at first, but more satisfying in the end. CD mixers are for posers that want to be the centre of attention but cant be bothered to put the hours in learning the skills that justify you being there, learn to use decks and you can smoke these muppets every time.|`|29d894efaf763ea1c0c37c11acf8c338aa	Um.... from a professional no.<br>  <br>  It's entry level junk. But if that is you budget you are not going to get anything better.<br>  <br>  For a CD player, Mixer, amp and speakers your budget realistically should be $2000 US so convert that into your currency.<br>  <br>  I think that site is in British pounds so increase you budget by 1000
JwEZuVR4aa	no you can't i've been trying to find that out forever.
oAlOvNeEaa	Get a digital camera, cell phone pictures are very poor quality, the picture is so small you cannot make a quailty print from them. The only way to retreive pictures from the phone is to pay for each one you email to your computer. I only use the cell phone camera when I do not have my digital camera. The camera on the phone is just a means for your cell phone company to charge you more to send a poor quality picture to another phone than it cost to print a high quality picture from a digital picture.<br>   And no the camera cannot hold JPG images other that what the phone's camera makes.

Fnbgjvntaa	The short answer is they are in the know.  <br>  <br>  I work in mobile communications and I have received some devices months before they debut to retail.  <br>  <br>  For you - not being disrespectful - but you won't get it if you have to ask.

Rs1Mc34paa	Don't book an appointment at the Apple Store, your iPhone is jailbroken and they'll know when they look at your phone. By jailbreaking it, you have voided the warranty and so you cannot get a replacement iPhone if there is really something wrong with the iPhone itself (then again, chances are the warranty is no longer in effect if you're using a 2G iPhone). Just uninstall some of the stuff you installed with installer that you think may have affected it. If it still does not work, then you'll have to restore it.|`|7kCeVLNlaa	I have an ipod touch with the same version software. What I did was booked an apple genius on the apple store. They are totally free and they give you advice. You can ask them what your problem was. Funnily enough I had exactly the same problem and they told me that it had a problem with its memory and that I needed a new one as I was inside my 1 year warranty. But if however you are not within your warranty you can try and restore on itunes.

qWicVoU9aa	You do NOT want to change to 2.2.1.  That version changes your bandwidth and so far it has not been able to be jailbroken/unlocked.  The most you would be able to get is 2.2, but in doing so it will be locked again and you will have to unlock it again.  I have included a free website that shows screenshots on unlocking it again and another website that uses a software verion and is $9.99 (and claims they can repair ones from pervious unlock attempts that have failed or bricked)

fwnqB0dTaa	It can happen, but not always.<br>  <br>  You can also lose internet access after unlocking, it depends on how things go with the unlocking process, and your service provider.<br>  <br>  You should know though, if a firmware upgrade is released the phone will go back to it's original service provider and need locking again.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	You can have some issues with it, but if the phone allows you to change the text messaging settings and internet settings you'll be fine. Most common though is problems with the internet. Which means you'll have some trouble getting pic messages. <br>  You can get the settings for these from your service provider, or online, it's an easy adjustment.|`|Xjtv9LiZaa	no your brother was misinformed. you can get text messages. if you are worried about a specific phone talk to the seller or your wireless provider just to be sure.|`|UZBqOjy7aa	No, that's not true.

qWicVoU9aa	The site below is the only one I could find that listed your device and it costs $60.  You might want to try a local repair shop and see what they would charge to do it.  That just seems awful expensive to me.|`|ke0dsgkkaa	Try your last four digits of your phone number or call phone service if that doesn't work.

qWicVoU9aa	Your phone has absolutely no control over the time on received messages (and there is no way to make it) as the time is set by the network that it was sent from.  If the people who are sending do bnot have the correct time, or they are in a different time zone, then the time will not be the correct time on them
AA12075871	Absolutely. Just try navigating to any page (ex: google.com) using the phone's browser, safari.<br>  The iPhone will ask you to connect to any of the available WiFi locations it can find. Just pick your BT Broadband, punch in the password (if you have set it) and you are good to go !<br>  <br>  No charges whatsoever (except your broadband usage though)<br>  <br>  Cheers !

If you have a pay as you go phone it is possible your sim card is faulty. This has happened to me and there is no way around this, you will need a new sim card. Depending what network you are on you can get them for free online. Just search for free sim cards in google. ie "free o2 sim cards" etc. They have deals where you can have upto 4 free ones delivered. good luck.

cO10thlnaa	At a minimum, get the 16GB if you're mainly going to listen to music with the occasional TV episode or movie. 8GB just wont cut it seeing as atleast 1.5GB is taken up for the iPod's partition format settings and firmware data. If you plan on putting alot of movies and/or large games on your iPod, I would suggest considering the 32GB.|`|9buFpXgpaa	just get the Iphone, better connection and doesn't the same thing as ITouch plus make calls on.|`|AA10368633	It's true that the 32GB is expensive, but a lot of the people I know have the 16GB Ipod Touch.

deqc17Mkaa	Grand Theft Auto IV is known to cause system freezes sometimes, no one knows exactly why but it isn't something to worry about. Though I never heard of a 120gb PlayStation 3. They only have come in 20, 40, 60, 80 and 160gb models so I get the suspicion you have either upgraded yours or you bought one that had been opened at least to upgrade the hard drive.|`|HcZppReOaa	If you mean 120GB as in you installed it yourself, you may have bought a 7200RPM HDD which runs faster but heats up the PS3 more faster too.<br>  <br>  Also, GTA IV is also known to 'break' Blu-Ray drives and GTA IV commonly freezes on other people's PS3.<br>  <br>  It's actually safe to say this is normal. We don't know why, but GTA IV does this on the PS3.|`|YhdfaEJVaa	120gb? Odd? I only know of 160gb. Anyways. Do you have newest firmware updates for ps3 and for GTA IV? if not try that. If you don't have your ps3 hooked up to internet do so. I think mine has frozen a couple times also, I belive it just a glitch in game. Assasins Creed would freeze too when I first got it. Some times there's just excess code in a game that mighta been there for some reason or another and if you so happen to do certain things in certain order it would lead to that code and then freeze cause it doesn't know what to do from there.

q6uyloYdaa	You can't because you bought a PS3 model that isn't backwards compatible. I believe there are programs or something that you can install onto the PS3 to get PS2 games to work, but I'm not sure.|`|ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	I take it I'm going to be answering this question forever too:<br>  <br>  backward compatibility for the PS3 with PS2 games is as follows:<br>  <br>  20GB (4 USB slots, no longer in production) - yes<br>  60GB (4 USB slots, no longer in production) - yes<br>  80GB with 4 USB slots (no longer in production, bundled with MGS4 or Motor Storm) - yes<br>  40GB (2 USB slots, no longer in production) - NO<br>  80GB with 2 USB slots - NO<br>  160GB (2 USB slots) - NO<br>  any other up coming PS3's - NO<br>  <br>  in short: if it has 4 USB slots, yes. if it has 2 USB slots, no.<br>  <br>  all PS3s play PS1 games.|`|YhdfaEJVaa	Do you have a 20,60 or a 80gb mgs4 or motorstorm bundle ps3? If not you can't do anything. Sorry to break it you. Only the 3 listed above can play ps2 games.<br>  <br>  If it has only 2 usb slots. It is not one of the backwards compatible ps3's<br>  <br>  If it has 4 USB slots on left bottom corner and the cf, sd, etc slots above the left corner of ps3 then you are among the proud owners of Backwards compatible ps3's. <br>  <br>  There is no software you can download that will change that. And if anyone mentions it. There is a thing on the ps store for ps2 but it is for if the game requires a download of some sort that is all.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Because you probably don't have BC on your PS3.|`|jxpV13rTaa	only specific models are backwards compatible. you do not have one of these so you cannot play ps2 games. they no longer make this feature so if you really want one you have to find a used console. i have one myself and i NEVER play ps2 games on it. there are just too many good ps3 games out there|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Because you got the PS3 that can't play PS2 games.<br>  <br>  Only the 20, 60, and old 80 gb (came with Motorstorm or Metal Gear Solid 4 game) can play PS2 games.  The others (40, new 80, and 160) cannot play PS2 games.<br>  <br>  Look at the front of your PS3.  How many USB ports do you see?  2 or 4?<br>  <br>  If it's 2, you can't play PS2 games.<br>  <br>  If it's 4, then you can play PS2 games.<br>  <br>  There's no way to make your PS3 play PS2 games if it can't play PS2 games in the first place.
HcZppReOaa	To save games to a USB memory stick or w/e, what you do is, you connect the USB to your PS3 and then over the game save, press triangle and then select copy.<br>  This goes to everything else that's copyable.<br>  (trophies and game data will not be copyable)<br>  <br>  Upgrading your Hardrive will not help you play PS2 games.<br>  <br>  Your PS3 isn't working properly, call Sony.|`|HekFanRvaa	you're kidding. 60GB has the best backwards compatibilty with PS2. How come you can't play PS2 games?<br>  <br>  Bakcwards compatibilty has nothing to do with hard drive capacity. <br>  <br>  Check wikipedia and it will tell you you should be able to play PS2 games with it.
0AUTZt5Aaa	Settings-->system settings-->system info.<br>  <br>  It will usually be _4GB's.<br>  <br>  So for a 60GB it would be 54GB.|`|DQ8Y2mIDaa	yea bling bling is right. unless you want to do it the hard way take out the hard drive on the side. take out the blue screw and slide it out, check on the back and it will tell you.

YmcURwDAaa	If it's a full moon on a clear night, you can use the sunny 16 rule to meter. After all, the moon is just a rock in direct sunlight, no different than a rock in your front yard at noon.<br>  <br>  The Sunny 16 Rule: If you're shooting at f/16, use a shutter speed reciprocal with the ISO rating of the film.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  * f/16 - ISO 100 - 1/100s<br>  * f/16 - ISO 400 - 1/400s<br>  * f/16 - ISO 1600 - 1/1600s<br>  <br>  Or in your case, if you're using the telescope as a prime focus lens without an eyepiece:<br>  <br>  * f/7.5 - ISO 400 - ~1/800s<br>  <br>  You can fiddle with these numbers to suit the particulars of your situation. If the moon is behind clouds, less than full or low on the horizon, you'll want to make some adjustments. Bracketing is probably not a bad idea either. Good luck!
NznZENTqaa	Yep you can go to wherever and just buy a microphone!

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	If it's only for the PS2 and Wii, I wouldn't.  Not a huge difference between 480i and 480p.<br>  <br>  I don't think there are any PS2 games that are 720p/1080i/1080p, so it's a waste of 15 bucks.<br>  <br>  But if you think you're going to get a PS3 in the future, then go ahead and get the component cables because it can be used on the PS3.  When it's used on the PS3, you'll see a huge difference between the 480i/p and 720p/1080i/1080p.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	to me, i didnt make much of a difference for the wii from 480 i to 480 p,and i couldnt sell it back, so i just kept using it. the ps2 graphicws improve very much, so i sugest you just buy the cables.|`|UVdRnx8Faa	Yes I would do that the picture will look amazing

5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Take the battery off and check for water damage (there is a little white sticker with red lines, and if it has water damage it'll be red). It sounds like it's just your charger port that is messed up, not water damage though. Verizon should replace your phone if it's a year or less old. Otherwise you'll need to buy a new phone, or use insurance to replace it. Which is $50/phone, and you can only use it 2x per year.

KLL0Acrwaa	I'm presuming that your camera is a Canon 450D digital SLR, since I cannot find a Canon 4500 listed anywhere.<br>  <br>  The short answer is that the Sandisk Extreme III is twice as fast as an Ultra II card, and if you need the speed for multiple-frame bursts or RAW file shooting, then yes, you should exchange it.<br>  <br>  Here's the data:<br>  <a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/camera_multi_page.asp?cid=6007-9424" rel="nofollow">http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/camera_...</a><br>  <br>  In camera, the Extreme III writes jpegs at 10.3 MB/sec vs. 4.3 MB/sec for an Ultra II.<br>  <br>  You would see this speed: 1) if you fill up the camera buffer and are waiting for it to clear so you can take another shot or 2) when moving files from the card to a computer via a card reader.<br>  <br>  If you only take single shots at a time, with pauses between the shots of a couple of seconds or longer, then it makes no difference which card you get.  But if you do multiple shot bursts (think: sports photography, fast moving children, birds/animals) or RAW file shooting, then the Extreme III will clear the camera buffer faster and allow you to get more shooting in.  <br>  <br>  In jpeg, the buffer can handle 53 shots before filling up, which usually isn't a problem for sports, as long as you shoot jpeg.  The issue comes if you are a RAW file shooter; the buffer can only hold 6 shots.  If you are a RAW file shooter, I definitely would recommend the faster Extreme III card.|`|nW3iJkT5aa	Depends on the price difference<br>  I defy anyone to notice the difference in speed<br>  I also use canon the d40 & and interchange fine between ultra & extreme|`|qR4xcTfaaa	The difference between them is: Ultra II wright speed is 15Mbs and Extreme III wright speed is 30Mbs which means that you will probably not feel the difference.<br>  HOWEVER, you should know that the Extreme edition of SANDISK have a better technology  to protect the data from corruption and erasure than the Ultra II.<br>  <br>  Check it out on the B&H photo website and on the Sandisk website.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	no<br>  such a slight difference<br>  you won't even notice it<br>  I use ultra 2 all the time|`|RA9yBlReaa	lol no it wont make a difference if its the same size.

b4uCDAh5aa	Here's what you do.  In the iPod menu that appears in iTunes when your iPod is connected, go to podcasts choose sync podcasts. If that doesn't work, your iPod may not support podcasts. The original iPod nanos don't have that capability (those are the only widely used iPods today other than the iPod mini that don't have podcast support)

That should fix it.|`|JveqFUOJaa	Well 1st check the volume. It might be muted, or you can download from google a device if that doesnt work. Check all plugs from the computer. I had the sam situation. Make sure its connected to your computer.
cO10thlnaa	Your battery builds up a sort of "memory". If you keep putting it on the charger when it's still relatively full, you can kill the battery life by quite a bit. Usually a way of fixing this would be to only charge it after it dies, only take it off charging when it is completed. If you leave it on the charger for an extended amount of time after it is full, you can temporarily ruin your battery duration that way as well.
o6pdnnU8aa	That doesn't sound right.  Our cable provider has Analog and Digital.  Could be that they want to force people to Digital.|`|LddkW0JFaa	Unless her cable company is changing over to all digital, she doesn't. It might just be a way to trick her into buying premium channels. However, many cable companies are moving all non-local channels to digital to prevent people from stealing cable.|`|PuIjmuciaa	I work for a cable company...and to all those who think otherwise...even if you don't have a cable box, if you have cable with a cable company you ARE receiving digital cable, they were telling her she needed a cable box so she will subscribe to premium channels, more money for them, that's it....most of the channels offered by cable companies have always been digital...unfortunately some cable companies are using this whole analog transition to scare people into upgrading when they don't need to

The Nuvi models that end in '5' are the newest models of the series. They are faster processor which calculates routes and draws the maps faster, the interface is easier to navigate, and one of my favorite features is not only does it display how fast you are driving but also the speed limit on the road you are driving on.(This saved me a few times on the highway when the speed drops from 70mph to 55 without me noticing.)<br>  <br>  I own one and love it.

TXy9hI1Aaa	Depends on which Blackberry...<br>  <br>  The iPhone is basically is a great personal phone, and a media powerhouse. There is a reason why everyone compares its new phone to the iPhone, or call there phones, the "iPhone killer". When your on top, everyone is trying to get you.<br>  <br>  The pro's:<br>  1) Touch Screen done right. Literally, everything feels so natural. From a swipe of a finger to pinching pictures.<br>  2) Applications are developed by 3rd party, so you will get literally a library of new and improving software to add on<br>  3) Apple's signature media player - the iPod on the iPhone is amazing and the ability to play videos/songs married to your phone is nice.<br>  4) webpages come full standard and are easy to navigate with your finger<br>  5) lets you use wifi<br>  <br>  The con's:<br>  1) Not a corporate application. Can't handle corporate email, or doesn't do it well. Plus if you try to use the xchange program, it will kill your battery like no tommorrow<br>  2) The network isn't that great, sure it says 3G but it hasn't quite lived up to its potential<br>  3) the keyboard is virtual and takes some getting used to. As in, you may never get used to it.<br>  4) can't take video, and the camera is relatively weak<br>  <br>  When you say blackberry, there are many many blackberry phones.. so I will be as generic as possible<br>  Pro's<br>  1) Is mean to do corporate work, email, docs all handle super super well<br>  2) Well written OS, handles very well<br>  3) Has a keyboard<br>  4) The few apps that are written for the Blackberry all handle quickly and professionally...<br>  <br>  Con's<br>  1) It doesn't have a seamless media player, doesn't handle music and videos as well<br>  2) Screen may not be as nice or as big as the iPhone<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically what it boils down to is this. Are you using your phone for fun, and as an iPod replacement? Get the iPhone. For sure, the things the phone can do will never end. Everyday developers release new gadgets and apps for the phone.<br>  <br>  Using the phone for work? Blackberry all the way.<br>  <br>  Go and try both, and you will IMMEDIATELY see the difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|oSoTR4vLaa	You can play music on the Blackberry too.|`|LoD6EbAvaa	Iphone because it can play music and stuff|`|tx4kjh5uaa	both have features that make it unique, I's rather choose the iphone though|`|kSZstQ6Paa	i would choose the iphone but both of them are unique

I suggest this one because it is very easy to use and download music for completely free. This site is virus and spam free. No need any risky software like Limewire and whatsoever.

AroundMe (finds where you are and tells you what is around you like restaurants, hotels, pharmacies, etc..we've used this on a lot of trips) and WhitePages to find phone numbers of businesses on the road.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  You may never need expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, but the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)  <br>   <br>  There is no one place to get great buys, but click the second link in the information above then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.<br>   <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.

Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.

hUHwf0hmaa	It's broken and you need a new one.  Fixing an old CRT (if it's not a flat screen, but is almost as wide as it is deep and tall, in other words, looks like a box) TV is going to cost more than it's worth for the amount of time it will still be useful.<br>  <br>  And if it's a flat screen, you should take it back to where you bought it.|`|snzfXpVgaa	Your tv has switched to Digital!<br>  go get a reciver , at a best buy or radio shack,<br>  they cost about 50$|`|roLuavYXaa	likely problem is tv broken|`|sYMcyxpqaa	uhm...<br>  what?<br>  i think you just asked whats wrong with your tv....<br>  itr prolly broken.<br>  sorry.|`|bvUCo55Baa	Is it doing that on all stations?  <br>  Do you have cable?<br>  <br>  ....If you have cable, then something is wrong with your TV, and you will need to take it in to get fixed.  If you don't have cable, it could be a signal problem.  With the recent switch to digital (and more/most to come in June), different TVs are handling digital signals differently.  A common fix for this is often a better antenna (VHF), and you will NEED a converter box to be connected between your antenna and TV.  Make sure you apply for a government coupon if you decide to get a converter box. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
Z0odTlyQaa	March 19th!!! <br>  <br>  Good guess guy above me :)<br>  <br>  They just announced it tonight on Gamespot. Here's the link to the official release date announcement:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/callofduty5/news.html?sid=6205929&tag=topslot;thumb;1" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/c...</a>|`|SBcxooLsaa	go to callofduty.com and check|`|xR7to0bjaa	For whatever reason, the team at Treyarch are keeping their lips sealed on this one. For a time, there was word that the release would be coming on the 9th of March, but it's pretty obvious this is not the case.<br>  <br>  For my best guess, I think it would make sense if they released it on a Thursday, since this is the day that the Playstation store is updated... So the map pack will probably be released on either the 12th, 19th, or 26th. <br>  <br>  Until they give the release date, they'll have people logging on everyday to check if it's here yet. It's a surefire way to get more into the Playstation and XBOX stores this month so they'll start purchasing other random games while the anticipation builds for the new maps.<br>  <br>  My guess is Thursday the 19th.|`|kQuagqZHaa	The release date is official.  March 19th.  Check out Callofduty.com for further information.<br>  <br>  3 new multiplayer maps and 1 Zombie map.|`|u9hywtZ7aa	i think its 20th of march not sure definitely sometime in march late march i think|`|TDgjQcvoaa	Sometime in march.
nnPCSS4Haa	This should work. Your DVD Recorder only cares that it is receiving a signal so shouldn't be a problem. You will have to make sure you queue your 360 up to start record so you don't get the 360 background etc on your new recording. Might be easier to use a standard DVD player.

You can use a Tmobile phone with an AT&T sim card, and you can use an AT&T phone with a Tmobile sim card. That's it. All other phone companies design their phones differently from the inside. This is why you can not let them work with anything else.<br>  I thought Canada had Tmobile? If they do, why not just use Tmobile and then you can get the Sidekick with no worries?<br>  <br>  Hope I helped. :)
sg93GVSJaa	DRM = Digital Rights Management <br>  <br>  Games such as  SPORE have so much DRM on them that they become so much of a hassle it isn't worth it.  <br>  <br>  Yes, in the past Sony (don't think just because it is a good name that they can be trusted) has been busted hiding root kits in CDs<br>  See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_kit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_kit</a><br>  <br>  Basically DRM punishes the legitimate users, while only stopping the hackers cracking the games for an extra week or so.  <br>  <br>  You might also be interested in <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rig...</a>
TbTO5SXlaa	In low-light, non-flash photography its really all about the lens. Both cameras come with a slow 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 lens which is really not acceptable for low-light photography unless you're planning on using a tripod. In a club setting or just around the house an f3.5-5.6 lens is just too slow.<br>  <br>  If your main interest right now is low-light photography in clubs or around the house in my opinion you'd be better off buying a body and a 50mm f1.4 lens. An f1.4 lens is 2 2/3 stops faster than an f3.5 and a full 4 stops faster than f5.6..What does this mean?<br>  <br>  Lets say you're using ISO 400 and the 50mm f1.4 lens and your shutter speed is 1/125 sec. at f1.4. Change to your 18-55mm lens and at 18mm your aperture is f3.5 and your shutter speed drops to ~ 1/20 sec. To achieve the same shutter speed as the 50mm f1.4 lens will require an ISO of 2500 which is 2 2/3 stops faster than ISO 400. If we zoom from 18mm to 55mm our f-stop becomes f5.6 and our shutter speed would be 1/8 sec. To get back to the 1/125 sec. shutter speed we achieved with the 50mm f1.4 would require ISO 6400 which is 4 stops faster than ISO 400. Since digital noise with either the D60 or XS becomes increasingly noticeable as we increase the ISO we know its better to use as low of an ISO as possible.<br>  <br>  After you've finished READING & STUDYING the Owner's Manual for your camera, I suggest adding these books to your library:<br>  <br>  "Understanding Exposure" and "Understanding Shutter Speed", both by Bryan Peterson.<br>  <br>  "David Busch's Quick Snap Guide to Using Digital SLR Lenses" by David Busch. <a href="http://www.dbusch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbusch.com/</a><br>  <br>  Photography, like any subject, requires study. If you don't study, you fail.|`|d55HYaktaa	Just get the Canon Xs with the kit lens (18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS EF-S) and the very cheap 50mm f/1.8 EF. This fast prime is not as good as the 50mm f/1.4, the boken is not pleasant... but it is fast, and cheap, and that is what you want.<br>  <br>  The Nikon 50mm f/1.8 is far better that the Canon 50mm f/1.8, but the D60 will not able to autofocus it. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4 AF-S will work fine with the D60, but this lens is more expensive than the camera.<br>  <br>  Of couse I agree that the Nikon D60 is a better camera than the Canon Xs. But a fast prime lens capable of auto-focusing in the D60 is too expensive.<br>  <br>  Also, the Canon XS generates a better output than the Nikon D60 on high ISO "at the standard camera settings". But the Nikon would be better if you want to process the RAW file manually.<br>  <br>  PS: be aware that a 50mm lens will work in the Canon Xs like a 80mm lens on a 35mm camera. It's a short telephoto.|`|xJCFgEneaa	This is just my person opinion.  I always use Nikons.  They last forever, and have great color and picture quality.<br>  <br>  Also, there's the lovely little snap noise when you take a picture that you just don't get with a Canon.<br>  <br>  Oh.  And if you want to take low light pictures with no flash, a good investment would be a tripod.  Otherwise, the long exposure will cause blur.  No matter how steady your hand is, you're human and you're always moving.  The camera can detect this, and you won't get sharp pictures.|`|h61UOPHMaa	I love my Nikon but I've posted three good links below so you can make up your own mind on what you want from a camera. CNet is the one I swear by but the other two are good...one is a forum with other questions just like yours...you'll find your dream camera...it just takes time...|`|h7LxNEkMaa	i say the cannon rebel xs because cannons have such a great picture...

KSIY3EVVaa	YES, XBOX LIVE IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT. in my opinion, if u only hav halo 3, u should still buy xbox live. just make sure that u buy another game within about several months bcuz like every game, it WILL get boring. i personally recommend getting call of duty 4 or 5 bcuz they hav many different game types 4 different interests.|`|EsaFg8eaaa	Yeah for halo, any other online game people are SO freaking cheap. Like I love xbox and I love playing with some people, but like 90% of all matches people are teaming up in a free for all match.

What do you got to loose?<br>  <br>  Then buy a year memebership if you like it|`|VlmN3TLeaa	Yes.<br>  Xbox live is the best.|`|OuFhcdX9aa	well halo 3 really isn't a good single player game so if you don't have live then no. if you have live then halo 3 still isn't a great game simply b/c it gets to boring. there's just not enough maps to make the game last.<br>  i would suggest getting games like mass effect or Call of duty 5 and this friday Resident evil 5 the last two are good for multiplayer mass effect is only single player.|`|Un511PNWaa	yes get 1 year card 49.99<br>  <br>  have fun|`|UBvhTWnaaa	make u dont have any big tests coming up cuz once u get live u will play the minute u walk in ur house til u go asleep|`|XEBGK5Mkaa	HECK YEAH. <br>  I have an original XBOX and people are never on anything but Halo 2 on it, but it's still worth the money. I never get tired of it. I've even played Halo 3 online a little bit at a friend's house, and it's a whole lot better. You won't be disappointed if you do.|`|aTC0tmUIaa	I say it is worth it if you enjoy the xbox 360 so much you should do it I hate xbox 360s they are so bad and they arent very good but if you like get and pay 50 dollars a year <br>  <br>  Playstation 3 all the way baby free online|`|mZ9suLgXaa	ummmmm. yeah!<br>  if you've never played it get prepared to devote about 3 months straight playing xbox day and night. you wont leave your house. it'll die down but those 3 months are ecstasy.|`|n4cnWEBCaa	YES!!!!!! It adds a whole new dimension to gaming.|`|8lMPdz3naa	yes, you must have it to experience the xbox 360 fully|`|HiU8pyfjaa	yes for HALO 3 live is really worth it<br>  a lot of ppl play it online so yes i would strongly recommend it

AA12367392	I'll never know unless I sell a kidney lol! :)|`|Ar27UBs3aa	Samsung F480 is a fashion phone. The F480 has high style looks as well as high technology features like a full face touch screen user interface and a 5 megapixel camera that supports not only auto-focus, but image stabilization for both still photos and videos. The card shaped F480 has a number of other features that should keep people both connected and entertained. A built-in FM radio is a good start, and support for both email and mobile blogging are included as well. Bluetooth 2.0 support handles short range wireless needs for the F480. The Samsung SGH-F480 measures 95.9mm x 55mm x 11.5mm (3.8" x 2.2" x .5") in size and supports GSM/EDGE on the 850,900, 1800, and 1900MHz bands as well as UMTS/HSDPA on the 850MHz and 2100MHz band.<br>  <br>  <br>  for more spec and detail u can visit the this web|`|FHRLpkVmaa	I'm not sure if it's the exact same model number, but I had two samsung glyde phones from verizon with the touch screen front and they were both HORRIBLE (which is why I had two..in a very short amount of time). Samsung is better for their TVs and other electronics, but when it comes to phones you should stay away, in my opinion. I've tried about 4 samsung phones and they have all disappointed me. So far I find that LG makes the best phones. Good luck! Hope this helps!! :)|`|zmBSnT6iaa	my mums got it its sick to look at but alright services but the real phone part is crap

To test this, hold down the left Alt key on your computer keyboard and type 155 on the number pad.  When you release the Alt key you should see the ￠ sign.  Alt 3 = ?.<br>  <br>  You have interrupted the camera program by removing the batteries while the camera was on.  It did not have a chance to do a normal shut down, but if you leave the batteries out for about five minutes it should cause the camera to reset.<br>  <br>  Digital cameras reset to original settings if batteries are removed for one minute. Time varies with function/camera.  Remove extra memory to eliminate this as a possible problem.  Check display/setup menu for non-auto functions and date/time.  Insert fully charged/cleaned batteries and restart camera. The ultimate non-physical repair for software-using devices is reset by removing power ... VCR/DVD players one month.<br>  <br>  Also, the batteries should be charged and battery and camera electrical contacts cleaned.<br>  <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.  Those batteries are still going strong after four months of normal use and have not been recharged.<br>   <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a><br>   <br>  Most NiMH rechargeable batteries lose charge and should be recharged when not used after two weeks, but Duracell and RayOVac new formula 2000mAh NiMH batteries hold charge one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo-34.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo...</a> ...<br>  This link is about prolonging the life of lithium-based batteries which last from two to three years, but are very expensive. A Sony series G rechargeable 960mAh lithium-ion battery is $49.88 at Walmart.<br>   <br>  If batteries are removed more than a few hours, the date/time setting and other set-up information will be lost. If the camera is being stored for a long time, the batteries should be removed and stored properly.<br>   <br>  Carry and dispose of batteries in baggies, blister packs, or other containers to protect ends from short circuit. Batteries explode when short circuited. NiMH batteries are environmentally friendly and may be discarded with trash.<br>   <br>  Camera reports batteries low, but is it low charge or bad electrical contacts? Overcharging can ruin good batteries!  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera.<br>   <br>  Digital cameras require lots of power. Bad electrical contacts can cause lots of problems so battery and camera contacts must be cleaned properly.  Batteries may be fully charged, but camera will indicate "low" if contacts are not really good. The LCD screen is a low steady load, but when lens extension, optical zoom, focus, and flash charging are added in the capture mode; the load is very heavy.  Bad contacts make cameras do strange things like making bad pictures or shutting off with the lens out. <br>   <br>  NiMH batteries should be recharged when camera reports batteries low.  Old batteries can discharge over night, but may provide normal service immediately after being charged.  Battery pairs no longer usable in cameras may work well in flashlights.  Do not drop batteries or allow voltage below one volt.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  Never touch battery ends or camera electrical contacts.  Oil from fingers will contaminate contacts.  Use batteries in matched pairs of same brand and rating.  Do not mix old and new batteries.  New will only do as well as old.<br>   <br>  Click source link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.<br>   <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a>|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	contact kodak.com<br>  they can help you fix it over the phone|`|GWLYAk3Haa	Take the camera to your local RadioShack and have someone take a look at it. <br>  They'll be able to help you there. <br>  Not to meantion, if you still have the warenty on it, they'll give you a refirbished camera. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope everything works out for ya(:|`|kC7r1fFDaa	that was a stupid thing to do  you need to get the whole thing repaired because when you do that all of the things on the memory card get deleted and your camera goes into a "cam coma" and it will only get out of the "cam coma" if you get it repaired|`|lmtusbb7aa	Try with different Batteries, and i know this might sound gay but make sure your putting them in the right away,<br>  <br>  Also hold down the on botton sometimes it takes time. x|`|cjlwOKR1aa	send it back and say it wasnt your fault, because that waht i would do................

KLL0Acrwaa	Yes, as long as:<br>  1) it's from an authorized Nikon dealer from this list:<br>  <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/fileuploads/pdfs/Authorized_Dealers/Nikon_AuthDealers.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikonusa.com/fileuploads/pdfs...</a><br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  2) you get the same warranty as a new camera.<br>  <br>  With amazon, the thing to be careful about is that they have "affiliates" who may not be a Nikon authorized dealer, but are allowed to sell on the amazon site.  Also, with refurbished cameras, the warranty may be from a third party, rather than from Nikon itself.  So if the camera company goes under or the repair company goes under, you won't have a warranty.<br>  <br>  That being said, I have bought refurbished items with no problems (primarily from Cameta Camera, which is an authorized Nikon dealer and which is an established camera retail company).|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	good choice<br>  it is a good camera<br>  and the problems are already fixed|`|d55HYaktaa	The 18-55mm non-VR lens has a better bokeh than the 18-55mm VR, but of course the VR version has a advantage on low-light conditions. Also, the VR version has a better flare control.<br>  <br>  Both are great lens, with good sharpness and low distortion. But I think the VR lens is better because low-light performance is more important for me. Bokeh is important on medium-long telephoto lenses, not on wide/short-tele zoom lenses.<br>  <br>  Also, the anti-dust systems aren't very efficient. The D60 may require a sensor clean process in the future, like the D40. It's more important to take care when changing the lens, and to avoid using the camera in places with a lot of dust or sand.<br>  <br>  The D40 has less megapixels, but it doesn't matter. 6Mp vs 10Mp is just a difference of 30% in horizontal and vertical size (3000x2000 vs 3900x2600).<br>  <br>  The D40 has a hybrid electronic-mechanical shutter that allows flash synch at 1/500s, but the D60 does at 1/200s. This is a great advantage, since you will be able to use flash to capture moving subjects with less blur.<br>  <br>  I think the most important differences are the faster flash sync speed of the D40 (1/500s vs 1/200s), the VR lens of the D60 kit, and the dynamic range optimization of the D60.<br>  <br>  Both are great cameras. If they have the same warranty and the same price, the D60+18-55VR would be better than the D40+18-55.|`|qR4xcTfaaa	I am sure that the camera will work fine, BUT, since today cameras are so sensitive and sophisticated  do you really want to take a chance with a refurbished and no warranty?!<br>  These days you can buy for less then $500 a D80 kit, which is a much more solid camera then both D40 & D60 and also it is a pro level camera as designated by Nikon USA.<br>  <br>  As for the lens, I  recommend for you to start with a mid level lens, the lenses that come with the camera are low end. Lenses you can buy used if you trust the seller, because they last much much longer than Digital cameras.<br>  You must always remember - The LENS is the most important part of the picture, therefor you should invest in mid to high end lenses.<br>  Starting with 24-85mm F2.8/4.0 is a very good serious amateur lens for wide angle(or 24-120mm) this lens is great for Landscape, portrait and micro pictures. As for Tele Zoom I recommend the 80-200mm F2.8 ED even if you get it used from a good owner (new is almost $1000 or you can get the TOKINA model or TEMRON etc) this lens is great for wild life photography. with these 2 lenses you can not go wrong, the first lens also have a 1:2 Micro capability and since the D40 is a DX camera it will be 1:1.5, this will allow you to get very Very close to a flower or butterfly etc.<br>  The range will be 35-117mm and 117-290mm since they are FX lenses (which also gives you the opportunity in the futur to upgrade to an FX camera and then 24mm will be 24mm etc) the GLASS in these lenses are the best of NIKON NIKKOR
TXy9hI1Aaa	Standing from a PURELY monetary standpoint I would say bad trade...<br>  <br>  the 8GB iphone 2G is worth only about $100 dollars on craigslist right now.<br>  <br>  The 16GB iPhone touch is worth slightly more, so already from a monetary standpoint your losing in this trade.<br>  <br>  Do you have AT&T or are you planning on jail breaking the iPhone? Honestly, anything you can do on the iPhone you can do on the iTouch minus the 2G and phone. The 2G is nothing to write home about, and gets about the same network speed as the Sidekick. At the same time you get the same UI with the iTouch.<br>  <br>  I would try selling both iTouch and Sidekick online and see if you can get about $200-$300 and buying a brand new iPhone. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WdQLGLmTaa	I think that you'd be giving a little too much.<br>  try the ipod and just like 100$<br>  and you can sell the sidekick seperatly for like 200$
oQSzZeubaa	Hello!  According to the Roland support folks (contacted today via e-mail), the GR-20 is compatible with the GK-2 pickup system.  Best regards, Dana

D8BDhIGwaa	My friend has the same problem, all the other games work.  Just not COD5.  We've tried the disc on 2 other machines and it works fine.<br>  <br>  He's back to playing COD4 now!<br>  <br>  Microsoft says they will fix it (as it's a DVD drive problem).  So long as you're still under 12 month manufacturer's warranty.

9idf2jJvaa	Yes, but only if its the screw in coax, the push on orange one is the digital coax and will not work. The best thing you could use is an HDMI, if you dont have one of those then use a Fiber Optic audio and component video, if no fiber just the component with the RCA's, and if no component just use RCA no coax at all.|`|68987bf06c72365658d1b5e20bc9b5e8aa	yes!|`|FgTkF31iaa	No the coaxial is digital audio only you have to use componite or composite on most older DVD players the newer ones use HDMI for both
