aTkPvZQuaa	cos theve got the money........................|`|AA11510511	I think that is double standards too. FiFA are telling teams that they must field a certain amount of 'homegrown' talent, but yet the club could be owned by any person in the world with enough money.|`|lrhOwySRaa	Here is how I look at it...Its a World Economy.  That would be like being an American and stop drinking Budweiser because a Belgian company (InBev SA) now owns Anheuser-Busch.   People drink what they like and support teams/clubs they love.  You still have the history and by having the new ownership it allows your club to compete better in the transfer market.    The new owners regardless where they are from want their investment to be successful and as a fan that is what you should care about.|`|AA11900069	I hate football, it is all so pointless.  What I have noticed though, is that all the players in the UK teams seem to be foreign!  Why not have foreign owners?  Even the England team is managed by foreigners, isn't it?|`|AjARqhvUaa	because football is all about money now, most of the top english clubs are owned by foreigners |`|nLGQjMCdaa	people just want big names thats all mate,somthing for there fans to brag about "we have so in so so we'r gonna beat you to shreds" and all that crap.    i sure hope we stay as we are, we get picked on enough about not playing enough english players as it is.|`|3jeljs1iaa	buy the best players=have the best team  nobody really cares about ownership, just success|`|guBTq3ELaa	Because they seem to give more money for players which means better players and a better team|`|9dzSM8dqaa	Its all to do with money and power and influence, something the Arab countries have but we in Britain don't have anymore. Football will not be a working class sport soon either as the prices you pay are getting too steep, then it will be for rich only, except for TV|`|0CNaq92taa	Because all ventures in the western world are driven by the power of cash,we forsake everything else.The fact is that money takes away every sense of fairness and equal opportunities in sport as well as everything else.How can a club with a total squad of 12 compete against clubs with a squad of 35 players.True sport is all about equals challenging each other.The sad reality is that English clubs have forsaken all sporting values and their identities for the monetary vultures from anywhere.The only connections most top clubs in the U.K have with England is the fans who supply their cash via the turnstiles .When a game becomes a business,sport goes out of the window.|`|UrpxXDPSaa	Yes I agree, I believe any owner/ manager/player should only be at a club if they love the team and love the football they play.  At Arsenal for instance you get the impression that Arsene and the players love the club and i'm not to sure about what position the share holders are in but i think most of them have a love for the club and it's history, however, this usmanitov? or whatever his name is will only want the club for a financial gain, whereas Stan K, loves sport so i believe that he would be a better prospect, but it isn't ideal.  Having a rich owner wouldn't be the end of the world for me but the club will change a lot if this happens and we will lose some of our values. I think the man city are taking a huge risk with their new arab owner because as Wenger said, if he is just using the club as a hobby then it could mean bad news for man city if he gets bored.  I hope Arsenal don't get taken over and the shareholders show their love for the club by being strong and not selling, but i will still support them whatever happens as its the players and manager that i support.   |`|5903cc1871e917d81c84aa53cb516378aa	people r just making excuses cause they r jealous of arsenal's style of football. they are starting to field more english players tho.      no one ever complains bout liverpool's lack of english players. only ones i can think of are gerrard, and carra pennant also but doesn't play.    hope we don't need to sell

d11d158c46b97375580b6a62d5079c5caa	I'm a wrestling fan as well. And I was a huge Eddie fan and at the begining  I was a huge Benoit fan  as well. I've followed Benoit career for 15 or so years, since Wild Pegasus.     But there are differences between guys like Eddie Guerrero who died because of steroids, but he knew he had a problem and went to rehab and guys like Chris Benoit, who knew he had he had a problem and (lets be direct here) killed his family.    True about Benoit. .Nothing can take out the fact that he was indeed one of the best technical wrestlers. But no.. Nothing justifies what he did.  Eddie died like a legend because he was clean for almost three years. Damage was already done. Chris Benoit and Eddie were great friends. You see your friend dying from steroids (being clean for three years!!) you just DON'T MESS WITH STEROIDS. That simple.    As Kurt Angle said on an interview:   "This is not WWEs fault and this is not Vince McMahons fault. Chris Benoit was responsible for his own actions.      All the respect I had from Chris Benoit is long gone..    WWE is MAINLY about wrestling, but they have bonds with Make a wish and other organizations so there is a humanitarian part as well. I don't care how much of a good wrestler was Benoit, he IS a criminal and doesn't deserve a tribute, at all.|`|H7p09fL2aa	well it really was shocking when i found out that one of my favorite superstars died   i mean everyone remembers him as a murderer instead of remember him as the good things he did the great wrestler he was   i mean why cant they say something like  the 2004 rumble winner   or the former world champion  etc  he was a great person in my mind    and eddie was the best  I LIE I CHEAT I STEAL  VIVA LA RAZA|`|b55c12147b6ab2a63db836e825a3b341aa	eddie and chris were good wreslers but the drugs sent chris mad.... personaly i think for what he did to his family he is an asshole. why should wwe make a tribute to a murderer?????|`|afd348eeaa1d0ee1078d33de02cb2771aa	well for me, chris benoit was good  but don't quite understand why they didn't made a tribute to benoit.    when they actually said that "Kane murdered her mother (dramatization of wwe)"  hmmmmmmmmm, that's cheap enough|`|cRbWvJ4Caa	the guy killed his family. why would u cry for him.|`|5pv584ZHaa	Chris Benoit can ROT IN HELL|`|fXTKnoZfaa	man he was awesome i miss him|`|sCTF61c3aa	well i do miss him but what he did is kinda scary....

d3c9e4814f1a4e439dee8535a8117ae8aa	It's likely that due to lack of fitness you ran at too high a heart rate, therefore running above lactic threshold and thereby accumulating too much lactic acid in your legs.  Maybe next time take a heart rate monitor and run below lactic threshold.    Other problems could be lack of biomechanical strength, i.e. you're not used to any impact sports and running is high impact.    Or problems with the way you run for example overstriding.    Keep at it (providing you have appropriate running footwear) and it should get easier.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Your legs are going to be sore for a few days.

Catch your ankle with your right hand and keep it there, change hands, and with your free right hand, make short but firm karate-style chops all over your quads, from you hip to your knee.  Make sure they hurt a little, you are trying to get the Lymph-drainage working here.  It should take at least two minutes.

Yslq4OYhaa	Pugspaw has given the best answer thus far. You can't get an accurate answer to which has the most joint locks. Many systems use joint locks. But some use them more. This can and does vary from school to school. Traditional jujitsu has many locks and small joint manipulations. Many of these are illegal in BJJ. But they are very effective. They will cause a BJJ guy to willing give up their guard or superior position..LOL I believe pugspaw knows what I am talking about.. Like Pugspaw we teach joint locks and counters to the locks. Our locks include throws. Many of the throw are done with the lock.  You can't work those techniques with just anybody. It would be easy to injure your partner and tears some ligament or dislocate some joints. We also teach throw and counters to the throws. We teach the difference between being nasty with you counters and locks to keeping the would be attacker under control without being nasty. It is a choice that you have to make. Being nasty may involve adding an elbow strike to a bent elbow or reverse wrist lock. I may include a few groin strikes or a shin kick with tai otoshi. These things may not be necessary hence the term "nasty", but they work extremely well.    Pugs you are not alone in what you teach. We teach that in our dojo too.    I can't speak much on Chinna. I am aware of it, but I have no formal training in it. I don't even know if it is being taught anywhere near me.    One more comes to mind is Aikido or any form of Aikido or Hapkido. These are well know for their joint locks and manipulations. Sometime they get a bad reputation from uninformed people that do not understand the art.|`|nRBC4E5saa	There are a lot of them.  Off hand, I'd say a good list is:    Japanese Jujitsu  Catch Wrestling  Sambo  Brazilian Jiujitsu  Aikido  Hapkido  Chin Na|`|jdGH0yaKaa	Chinna would be my first guess.  But, it corresponds to Jujitsu in Japan.   If you want to learn joint locks it would be easier for you to go to a Judo or Jujitsu club to learn them.  Sambo has leg locks.      Here's some info on Chinna:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_Na      |`|AA10923892	Japanese juijitsu and (chinese) Chin Na/Qinna. Both have little prohibitions about wich joint locks are allowed or not. (except in competition)    Judo and Brazilian Jui Jitsu have quiet a few too.|`|QGTHjrDHaa	Brazilian jui juitsu  The adcc championship is an international grappling competition and 90% of the winners come from a bjj background.  Other notable martial arts include, sambo, wrestling, jkd and judo  Brazilan jj rules the roost though|`|4mpO3i8vaa	I will respond to the Aikido aspect of this question. Aikido utilizes many joint locking postitions in the process of taking a persons "center" or balance. Joint locks are very effective and this is due to the practioners ability to grab accurately. Any, and I am not well versed in other arts that use joint manipulation, is going to depend on your ability to grab accurately when needed. This is often instantanious and done while moving in a manner that allows the attacker to continue to move in the direction he was going. Fumbling with the grab is a death sentence and the main reason newer students end up wrestling to catch up once the timing is lost.|`|8U1aivfwaa	jiu jitsu|`|C0sT0PPyaa	BJJ.....people who do other joint lock stuff like and say BJJ isn't the best are look at it from inside their box.  BJJ is the best not because of its style but because they spar.|`|AA11900069	A friend of mine works with - potentially violent - criminally insane patients in Broadmoor, the hospital/prison.  He is trained in the system they call 'Control-Restraint' which is a number of holds and extensions of tendons/locks applied to the boisterous individual to stop them harming them-self and others.  He has shown me some of them, most of which I knew about, and they are very effective!|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Your question is difficult to answer exactly. Many martial arts have joint locks. There is no way to say for sure which has the most. Some jujitsu systems use more joint locks than throwing techniques. Most however seem to use more throws than locks. The system I teach just happens to favor joint locks. As such, I teach joint locks, counters (for locks), counter locks (does not just release the lock but turns it into a lock on the attacker), counters for throws, and counter throws.  The only problem here is that I can't recommend anyone because as far as I know my instructor, me, and my students are the only ones doing things like we do.    Best thing I can suggest is to check out as many jujitsu (Japanese, not BJJ) as you can find.    Edit:  Darb D   No one is putting down BJJ here. I see no need for your comment about how BJJ is the best. Besides I was doing martial arts long before BJJ was ever heard of. There is nothing wrong with it. It is just that there is nothing new in it either.  Some people seem to be under the mistaken idea that BJJ has something new. Sorry to tell ya, but we were doing that stuff a long time ago. We simply did not feel the need to try to call it something new.

bR5Dzulsaa	If you go to a foreign country, it's not Rooney on the cover.    Ronaldinho is the universal player-representative of FIFA. I think they have a contract with him, which even though he's not on the top of his game, they must honour. Plus he's still a massive marketing brand.    Rooney is on the cover to appeal to the English fans (don't know how his fat hairy face is meant to appeal to me as a welshman, but there we go!). If you go to France it's Riberry's face on the front with Ronaldinho's.    The real question is why do they keep picking players that are ugly as sin? (Ronaldinho, Rooney, Riberry).|`|LReOvHEdaa	Ronalidinho is ok to be as he is still the most marketed player.  About rooney i guess he is the "best" in england not sure If  I am right but thats what they must have thought.  Remember players are chosen region wise with ofcourse ronaldinho on every cover.|`|El7C2JsMaa	The covers are different in different countries they all have Ronaldinho on the front but the other player changes depending on the area of the world its being sold, uk has rooney, france has ribery and benzema, i think USA has Maurice Edu and Guillermo Ochoa and so on    I'm asuming Rooney and Ronaldinho have some sort of sponsorship deal with EA because they have been on every cover since 06|`|mMPcD6SHaa	I agree Christiano Ronaldo is the future, but still Ronaldinho is the best in the world, so I can understand why he's still on the cover. Even though he's the best though he's not the only one, so I can see the other players you mentioned being in the discussion, but as the face of the game to a wide audience, it's still Ronaldinho.|`|d249327bb8b9be89e88a359ce5e59a58aa	ooh i thought it was going to be a joke.  maybe cos they are both so ugly the company took pity on them.  i know lots of thumbs down  by the way sane  q and a people there are a lot of clones and trolls about tonight, so be careful .    super - very funny x    spot the two trolls, both had footballers names. sad sad sad|`|JsxuCDSJaa	there both under contract to ea|`|ee8904782a0e18e01869fd6f11b5d26caa	its because they bring out the true meaning of footballl and its coz of their never say die attitude.|`|pYYO0wviaa	I understand why Ronaldinho is there but we all are just getting bored of him but Rooney?! I don't see why he is on the front cover, I see him as a fairly average player who his overrated and overhyped by the media. The English love him and I doubt non English football fans even know who Wayne Rooney is.|`|quYLRIrgaa	C Ronaldo and Fabregas have both been on PES covers in recent years  and Messi is on this years.  Not sure why Kaka has been overlooked (maybe he doesn't agree with endorsing a game?), but sure Torres will be picked in the future.|`|LyiRHRAJaa	ROONEY is sexy and they need to attract customers to buy the games  and they do coz they find rooney so sexy that they just have to buy it    they should put a pic of roon on every item   then everything would sell by millions|`|z8jZaE5Gaa	i think they offer themselves to be at the front cover  |`|LBRRdhOOaa	they should have someone like drogba!!!!  and i find it really annoying aswell!!  i know im not into FIFA games but if drogba was in front cover  i would buy it  |`|v0YY9CXiaa	omg i reckon  rooney is a piece of ugly sh*t  ronaldinho is still acceptable    THEY SHOULD PUT A SEXIER FOOTBALLERS ON THE COVER  AND NO NOT C.RONALDO
olIfEPFgaa	Just the talents matched up together would be great, but I think jealousy, manhood and ego would destroy the playing. They would alawys try to seek conformation and attention and they wouldn't allow each other to take some space and make goals. |`|67qiqedgaa	Torres cant pick up a pass some of you say, that's why he scored 33 goals last season all from open play, no free kicks or diving penalties that Ronaldo is a master of.    Yahoo Question    Out of 38 goals scored by Ron last season how many were penalties? WAIT!    How many penalties has he scored in this season so far? CANT PICK A PASS MY AZZ!!!!|`|Q3hOqlOTaa	I dont think they would match. Since who would get the assist? Ronaldo will always try to get the goal himself.    Kay: Torres cant pick out a pass? who set up Keane on wednesday with a perfect cross?  Kay: Torres isnt supposed to be assisting, he was the lone striker last season, so he would he assist? But Ronaldo is a winger, technically he should be assisting the strikers..|`|bWIkuKxdaa	Yup! Torres will gladly join Ronaldo in Man Utd and abandon a sinking ship known as Liverpool.|`|NbVmX4mMaa	Dunno. Torres can't really link-up like a true target man and he can't pick out a pss to save his life. And all Season they'd be trying to out do eachother. Ronaldo would be too selfish to pass to Torres. I wouldn't put 2 selfish players up front.    Hey Yo Nick! I'm talking about all Season. Not once a month. How many assists did Tores get last Season? Like 4. And Ronaldo got 8. Which is worse because he is supposed to be a winger.|`|uUitKmJMaa	it would b good, but toores is staying put! but that scum ronaldo would never pass the ball to torres!    LFC FOR LIFE  |`|JsxuCDSJaa	guy above me when torres was bagging goals in la liga a few years ago ferguson put in an offer then liverpool came along and he went to them because he supports them...|`|opIdbHXpaa	i agree with nick. i am unsure wether the two could work together on the same team. Both are incredible players but the ability to work together to score goals, in my opinion would not be there.

Y7CH521faa	Well Celtic had a couple of near misses, one that hit the bar and would have gone in if a couple of inches lower, so if United had had a goal ruled offside then it could have been a different result. We have to go to Glasgow yet but i can`t see Celtic putting four past United`s defence.|`|JsxuCDSJaa	the linesman was an idiot rooneys goal were he took it round the keeper was ONSIDE berbatov 2 goals were offside it should of been 2-0 but o well we still outplayed sh1tic|`|AA12370193	I thought they pushed it in overdrive after going for a second illegal goal and actually getting it.|`|LoFCv31waa	Given the financial resources of the respective clubs in England and Scotland and the difference in talent, Rangers and Celtic at the presnt time, would be in the lower half of the Championship with the rest of the SPL lucky to hold their own in Division One.    But for the Old Firm at least, all that would change dramatically as the cash and spin-offs from the TV deal south of the border kicked in. The problem for the Glasgow teams would be....are they and their fans wanted in the English leagues?|`|eTIHtfDpaa	Well, to be honest the SPL is highly overrated.    The Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 (France), Russian Premier League, Portugese League, and Dutch League are all better    If Celtic and Rangers did join the EPL, they would probably be around mid table to maybe 5th      With Villareal in the group, I think they are looking at Uefa Cup. Very little chance they will move on, even if they get healthy

Mas o q ouvi noticiar mesmo eh morte p ataque de tubar?o em guas nordestinas e na frica do Sul pq os surfistas, nos olhos do tubar?o, ficam parecendo tartarugas.

Creio que se os surfistas utilizarem faca, n?o vai adiantar em muita coisa n?o, o certo  concientizar tanto aos pescadores e aos surfistas, que tem lugares tanto para a pesca como para a prtica de esportes.    A palavra chave neste caso,  PREVEN??O, a melhor solu??o para um dilema igual a esse  a informa??o de onde pode ou n?o praticar esse esporte, enfim, cabe ao ser humano, saber at onde v?o os limites, pois somos MORTAIS, e podemos sofrer qualquer acidente em qualquer hora e lugar!|`|eaQYYOVvaa	Acredito que tem tudo a ver sim. O uso da faca, a exemplo do mergulhador,  um recurso a mais para se livrar dos enrosco t?o comum no nosso litoral. Tudo vale para se proteger e para evitar acidentes. Como praticante de mergulho aut?nomo aprendi com os mais experientes o seguinte. N?o adianta anos de pratica e conhecimento.

Vejas que quando surfando tu cais, a for?a da onda te faz rolar e ficar sem muita orienta??o at que consegues bater o fundo e for?ar a subida.   Acredito que em alguns casos em que surfistas ficam presos em redes uma faca  talvez solucionasse o problema, mas em muitos casos, n?o tens condi??o de desprender uma fala e cortar todos os ponto que o prendem. Depende da profundidade, da malha da rede, se o enrosco foi no cabo ou na malha, da for?a da mar do pico, da experincia do cara, etc..|`|IMZTjCV1aa	ent?o fica complicado eles nadarem com uma faquinha presa na perna msm em uma bainha ... pode ser contar eles msm esta faquinha ..... sabe a for?a das ondas eh t?o forte onde els pegam q msm com a faca nao iria dar tempo pra eles se desenrolarem da rede .... e por isso acaba acontecendo os tragicos acidentes com os surfistas.....  mais se desse certo seria uma otima ideia para q eles nao morressem mais  bjinhusssssss

i2U9s4jcaa	okay wen u start the game, i personally hav a list at home on what the equipment i need in order to ref so i dont forget anything. this includes, socks, cleats, shorts, jersey, badge, watch, coin, pen, gamecard, jacket and all that good stuff. wen u appear at the field stand and walk straight so u look professional, like ppl that are very fancy, head straight up, no slouching...all that manner stuff. if u look good they will giv u a good first impression. before u enter the field to check in the teams, remember..u10 and below is 25 minute halfs, u12 and below is 30, u14 and below is 35, u16- ithink its 19? is 40 minutes and ya... so that shud hel[ you. wen u ask for the game card, hand it to ur AR (assistant referee) and tell them to hold it...with a pen in their other hand. as u approach one team, you ask the coaches to ask their kids to lineup in a straigh line...preferably one of the white lines..depends where they start to set up, but mostly it shud be on the top of the box. this is routine for the kids so they might just do that my themselves. then u check for any jewelery...blah blah blah blah, as u speak u shud talk in a loud firm voice, not mean but pleasing, but kinda confident. u ask them to turn around so u are facing ther backs and tell them to lift up one fott so they are kinda doin the flamingo stretch. u go and look for any toe cleats or any cleats with screwins or metal. u look for toe cleats becuz they are dangerous, toe cleats are cleats with a stud on the very edge of ur cleat sole. thgey are only in baseball cleats and ppl try to use baseball cleats for both sports, but that is unacceptable and it only works vice versa. u want to look for any screw in cleats to make sure they are tightly screwed on and wont unscrew during the game because that screw can be dangerous. when looking, if you are and experienced ref, youll be able to see a toe cleat with out looking at the bottom, just how it looks, usually high on the heels. but some just dont see that, but if you know how socr cleats look like and all that good stuff u should see quickly. the screwins are a little bit harder, but u can ask the kids if they hav any. then u tell them to turn back around and make sure they dont hav any jewelery on, no earings, bracelets, rings...only if it is for religous reasons, thats only wen its okay. if ppl refuse to obey these orders, u can tell them that they cant play or for the toe cleats....cut off the one toe stud so it is safe. if ppl do not obey and still put there kid into the game, you can either give the coach a last warning and threaten to make them forfeit the gmae, after all the ref must control the game!!! after checking for that, tell ur AR to call off each name from the game card, and check them off once the kid showed their number and goes behind u. then u go on to the next team...after checking each team, giv them a lecture on how u want a clean game with good sportsmanship and if they are llittle kids, im sure they will listen, girls usually dont push at that age. OH YEAH, before checking in the teams, and u get the game cards from the coaches, be sure to offer a hand shake and look them dead in the eye and give them a firm hand shake, if they giv u a weak sauce dead fish handshake and u dont realise it after u squeeze hard, quickly dead fish back, dont look like a jerk. same with after the game, u shake the coaches hands FIRM, professionalism is a key. once done checking in, get the game ball(s) three preferably, one at the center one behind each goal and tell ur ARs to put one ball behind each net and then tell the coaches that u are goin to start the game in a few minues, always be sure to keep track of wut time it is so u can start on time, be sure to try to come to the game at least 30 minutes befor the gmae to ensure u hav enuf time and the coach has enuf time to talk to the kids. once u are at the center of the field with ur ARS next to u, call for the captains from each team. the procedure is to tell the players to introduce each other by shaking hands and telling each other their names. once done with that, u are going to show each team what heads and tails was on ur coin...so ther is no confusion. then say show wich team is away and say.."u get the toss" then say "call it in the air" so they dont cheat of any sort.if they win ....ask them. "do u want to defend this side or thats side..?" pointing to both ends, if they say "this side", then u will say to the home team.."okay, u will be defending that side starting off with the ball, pointing at which side they are defending." if the away team did indeed lose that toss, u ask the home team which side do they want to defend, then wut ever choice they chose, the away team will be on the other side kicking off. be sure to tell both teams clearly so ther is o confusion. then as the coaches begin ther prep talks, once u see u need to start the game now, u blow the whisle signallin its time to play. then once both teams are ready, look at both goalies to see if they are ready, see if ur watch is working, look at the ARs to see if they are ready, and begin ur match. believe me, g-9 is probably boringer than all the other games. boy u-9 are alittle better to ref, but girls seem to hav the gmae take ssssllllllooooowwwwweeeerrrrr. after u are done with the game, tell ur ARs to get all three balls, then both teams do ther cheers, and u are  "supposed" to watch any spitting on their hands...probably not in u-9. but stand there, and the kids will shake ur hands, then the coaches, after that u are free to go...be sure to giv back the balls to the home team and giv bak the player cards back to each team and turn in ur gamecard to wherever u need to turn it in. then u are donte with reffing the game :]|`|f66f591be1524e7f1bf19e95a7fed92faa	yea i'm a ref for like 3 years. when you check them in check equipment like shinguards and cleats. make sure they are not wearing jewelry. 9 girls should play 25 min halfs. make sure to be authoritive in all your calls and never back off because then they will question your authority|`|4522cc544de13f524bdddbee38f3c082aa	hope this helps...

J'ai eu peur que notre 15 finisse comme le PSG n qu sur le fil! alors, oui il y a eu essai! & ...Allez le pays de Galles!|`|10f17853d1ffb00769e8613b375f6d59aa	L'arbitre sur le terrain a dit aprs le match que selon lui il y avait essai. Cependant, le confusion rgnant dans l'enbut l'a pouss  utiliser la vido, l'enjeu tant trs important. Le prpos  la vido ne lui ayant pas indiqu qu'il voyait clairement qu'il n'y avait pas essai, c'est tout naturellement qu'il a t accord.  Personnellement je trouve dommage que cela se termine de cette manire. Je pense que le golavrage particulier est plus apropri en cas d'galit (cad on dclare vainqueur l'quipe qui a battu l'autre).  Pour l'essai seul the King (Elvis.....dsol j'ai pas pu m'en empecher) sait s'il tait valable ou non.    L'arbitre vido tait irlandais en plus.|`|d0dba826c334abce7e323c27763fec22aa	Oui ! c'est le ver de terre qui s'est fait assomm qui me l'a dit ! et l les gallois sont bien partis !!!|`|9c0d9384a9a5046faba2e1045a7b2d9aaa	je sais pas trop : on ne voyait rien...  mais bon, l'arbitre l'a accord, c'est bien l le principal, d'autant plus que l'arbitre vido est irlandais !    honntement, c'tait dans l'esprit de l'accorder.  ce qui est plus litigieux c'tait le carton jaune pour Lamont qui n'avait pas commis la faute.      @loha amies & amis Q/Ristes !|`|51b03e8339c1e3ff06fe641d5edeb866aa	Franchement et honnetement, je ne vois pas comment un Ecossais aurait pu se trouver sous le ballon et l'empe^cher de toucher le sol. Il est possible qu'il est gliss ensuite la main sous le ballon mais c'tait bien aprs l'essai: Vermeulen est en avance par rapport  TOUS les dfenseurs Ecossais.  D'ailleurs, l'arbitre  dclar aprs coup qu'il n'avait demand l'aide de l'arbitre video (un Irlandais !!!) que par acqui de conscience car il tait sur que l'essai tait valable.    Au passage, les Irlandais ne peuvent s'en prendre qu eux-mme: en voulant continuer  jouer aprs la fin du temps rglementaire pour marquer un neuvime essai au lieu de balancer en touche, ils se sont fait prendre en contre et on encaiss un second essai Italien. Voulant accroitre leur avance de 7 points, ils l'on rduite d'autant et cela les fait au final perdre le tournoi.    En ce qui concerne l'arbitrage: j'ai trouv Mr Joubert trs aga?ant: avantages non laiss, recours inutile  la vido, cassage du rythme, expulsion du mauvais Ecossais, non retour  un en-avant Fran?ais alors qu les Ecossais n'avait pas trouv la touche...et puis, prendre 10'' pour contourner la mle et venir constater que Harinordoquy  bien applati, cela fait un peu amateur. Je me demande s'il ne se sentait pas un peu juste physiquement et ne prolongeait jsuetement pas les interruptions pour souffler un peu.|`|LFia0dQNaa	La vido fait foi. Un excellent arbitre pour son premier match internationnal|`|KoA4iOueaa	Trs bon aritrage certes, mais je suis un peu comme toi, je ne suis pas vraiment sur que le ballon ait t applatit.  Enfin l'important est d'avoir gagn le tournoi, donc si l'arbitre vido valide, moi je suis d'accord.|`|4FY4kMJtaa	Dans le mouvement, l'essai semble valable. Mignoni vient mettre la pression qu'il faut sur les bras de Vermeulen.  Et je pense que vu l'enjeu l'arbitre n'aurait pas accord l'essai s'il avait eu un doute.|`|7aaaf991fa4460d93fa97ac72daf6d11aa	Aussi longtemps qu'il n'y aura pas un gazon OGM integrant une camra video, il sera difficile de juger une telle phase de jeu.  L'arbitrage a donc du s'appuyer sur l'esprit plus que du l'image.|`|pHNZjqUvaa	Oui il y a eu essai.  Et l'arbitrage t loin d'etre bon .. Celui qui dis le contraire et vraiment inculte. Retard du sifflet, arbitrage video souvent inutile, expulser le mauvais joueur ecossais n'est pas acceptable. Quelle ide de mettre un arbitre debutant aussi ...|`|dqMvMgcsaa	l'arbitre accorde l'essai dans le benefice du doute comme il etait de coutume de le faire avant l'arbitrage video...prime  l'attaque donc....c'est bien!|`|ef8de72cef716e824d5c3b0d1a7f8b78aa	OUI  excellent arbitre et on va pas s'en plaindre|`|G5T6f47Jaa	impossible de le savoir, je pense que l arbitre video a t un peu influenc par le fait que la france avait vraiment  fait un beau match|`|3LXUlaRyaa	On ne saura jamais mais dans le doute et avec la Coupe du monde organise en France .. l'enjeu etait en effet terrible..  on se souviendra de l'essai manqu contre les boks en 95 a Durban part benazzi .. il y etait !! mais les boks etait chez eux !!  ainfluence quand tu nous tiens !!!|`|8TxlxlL6aa	ouis je pense qu'il y a eu vraiment essai il faut se fier  l'appreciation de l'arbitre qui a t impartial tout le match|`|sEnTRjI5aa	OUI, IL Y A ESSAI !  un dfenseur cossais mets bien sa main sur le ballon, mais la pression que met MIGNONI sur le ballon tenu par Vermeulen fait la diffrence et c'est la pointe du balon qui appara?t fugitivement qui touche le sol : dans l'esprit, c'est bien qu'il ait t accord !|`|HSgf3486aa	On entend trs clairement l'arbitre dire  son arbitre vido : "I've seen the grounding, show me any reason why I shouldn't give the try" (j'ai vue la balle applatie, y a t-'il une raison pour laquelle je devrais refuser cet essai?) (on peut l'entendre sur le rsum du match sur le site de la BBC). Comme il n'y en avait pas (outre le fait que la vido ne montre pas la balle applatie, mais pour cela, l'arbitre de terrain tait aux premires loges et de toute fa?on, c'est pas sur ce point que la vido tait interroge), le pauvre irlandais a bien t oblig de dclarer que la vido n'apportait pas d'lment invalidant l'essai.    Donc essai.    Rappel, mme si la main d'un ecossais se trouvait sous la balle, il suffit qu'une partie du ballon touche le sol. Ce qui aurait pu invalider l'essai, c'est que le fran?ais ait marqu en deux temps... mais la vido n'a rien montr... avantage  l'attaque donc...|`|5X8GFE2Eaa	Normalement l'arbitre aurait du refuser l'essai car on ne voyait rien... ni les arbitres, ni les camras...  Dans le rglement si  la vido on ne per?oit rien alors c'est refus!!!  mais bon on ne se plaint pas !!!!|`|b1zWdLVBaa	je pense franchement qu'il y a eu essai.

Srieusement... le Kung fu n'est pas  proprement parl une discipline... lorsque l'on s'adonne srieusement  une activit, on peut considr que c'est du "kung fu" (synonyme de travail de qualit... le tour de main...)... ainsi on peut apprcier le "kung fu" d'un cuisinier... et vanter le mrite du "kung fu" d'un peintre... (vous me suivez ?)    le Ta? chi a t invent par un Tao?ste "Cheng des trois vents" dans le soucis d'tre en harmonie avec les lments naturels et la libre circulation du flux vital nergtique et ventilatoire (?a sonne un peu Dragon ball Z l... non ?). c'est une technique pour rester jeune.    De nos jours, on peut affirmer que cela n'a pas beaucoup d'incidence sur l'amlioration du souffle par rapport  la natation... le principal attrait (et non des moindre) permet d'entretenir la mobilit de l'ensemble articulations (aussi vrai que la natation) en conservant une ostognse importante (chose que l'on obtient pas... ou peu chez les nageurs).|`|03991ccb92f6de64df494c6b09ec6dddaa	Mais c'est violent tout ?a!

Trs efficace, il parait.|`|RkdIAcEmaa	C'est pareil.   Le Taiji quan n'est qu'un style, une cole particulire de "kungfu" ( prendre au sens d'arts martiaux chinois). Ce qui fait la diffrence, c'est :    1/ Le niveau de ton professeur (le "march" des arts martiaux est plein de p'**** rigolos qui enseignent pour se faire un petit revenu alors qu'ils savent  peine se battre),  2/ L'nergie et le srieux que tu mets dans ta pratique (parce que tu peux avoir le meilleur prof du monde, si tu ne t'entraines pas rgulirement, ?a ne te servira  rien, si ce n'est  perdre ton temps et  blouir de temps  autre tes potes nophytes avec quelques dmos rates),    Si tu veux t'informer en dtail sur ce genre de sujets, fais un tour sur ce forum : http://kwoon.info/forum/index.php    Pour complter, on distingue dans les arts martiaux les styles "durs/externes" et "doux/internes" comme le Taiji. A l'origine, tout les styles servent  combattre. Si un prof de Taiji te dit que "c'est juste pour entretenir la forme/la sant", zappe le. Il n'y connait rien. Le vrai Taiji permet de se battre. Mais ceux qui savent l'enseigner sont rares. Perso, je n'en connais aucun.  :-)    @ lenahel : Tu dis "si tu arrives  te battre avec le tai chi chuan, .......................champio... du monde!!!".   A quoi je rponds que le taichi,  l'origine, tait justemment fait pour se battre. D'ailleurs, c'est ce que pratiquaient tous les miliciens de la famille Chen du temps de Chen Wangting. A toi d'aller t'acheter des livres, lenahel ! Maintenant, je suis d'accord : la tradition martiale du taichi s'est en grande partie perdue, et pour trouver des personnes encores capables de s'en servir en combat, faut chercher loin ! C'est dommage.     Mais  qui la faute si ce n'est justemment  ceux qui te vendent le taichi " la sauce New Age" comme une simple mthode de bien-tre (avec des disques, en plus ! N'importe quoi !) et qui nient son pass martial simplement parce qu'ils ne sont pas capables de masquer leur incomptence dans ce domaine.    Donc je maintiens ce que j'ai dit au dbut : Taiji et kungfu, c'est pareil. Pourvu d'tre le bon lve pour le bon prof, l'efficacit sera au rendez vous dans les deux cas. Mais si tu as un prof incomptent et/ou que tu es un glandeur, quoi que tu fasses, y compris du Krav Maga, tu restera toujours incapable de combattre.|`|39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	ah non, le mieux c'est le Krav maga!|`|f277352bdf31c582e7f378af4e4e2006aa	Difficile de choisir.

Alors c'est vrai que les kung-fu men se servent du tchi pour les impacts mais se sont deux choses totalement diffrentes.  Il est faux de croire que le tai chi chuan soit fait pour les vieux, et d'ailleurs les asiates pratiquent ds l'enfance!   mon potos, c'est pas le kung-fu OU le tai chi, mais le kung-fu ET le tai chi!  @KD videmment que le krav, c'est le mieux! Mais rien nempche de faire les deux autres aussi !@Calogero, le krav maga na pas t invent par le Mossad mais par Imi Lichtenfeld et pour toute lArme de Tsahal ! Si tu crois que cest un mot bizarre, que fais-tu dans la rubrique Art Martiaux ???@mitch, lol. Par contre tu msestimes les apports du tai chi qui permet une rgnrescence du tchi, flux dnergie dont lexistence fut prouve par lI.R.M ! et la souplesse des articulations est sans communes mesures avec les maigres apports de la natation !sans compter que les nageurs ont un ralentissement de la vitesse de linflux nerveux musculaire ce qui nest pas le cas avec tai chi.   @ Henrique, tas jamais fait de tai chi ?parce que, situ crois, que c'est un petit truc ppre, tu te gourres! on PEUT le faire ppre nuance!|`|AVAbG4x2aa	Ce qu'on appelle le kung-fu en France, c'est un art chinois de combat externe, c'est--dire que l'nergie est surtout manifeste extrieurement. Le tai-chi serait plus une forme de combat interne contre les tensions et les dchirements intrieurs, de fa?on  se rquilibrer intrieurement, ce qui n'est pas mauvais non plus pour la sant. A cet gard, les deux se compltent plus qu'ils ne s'opposent.     S'il faut choisir cependant, cela dpend de ce que tu cherches. Si tu es un jeune fou qui a besoin de discipliner son nergie et/ou si tu cherches plut?t un moyen de self-dfense, le kung-fu sera sans doute prfrable. Le tai-chi, c'est plut?t si tu as dj une certaine maturit et une recherche d'quilibre et d'accomplissement intrieur. Il faut savoir aussi qu'au tai-chi tu travailles essentiellement sur un encha?nement formel strict de mouvements, ce n'est donc pas trop ?a pour le dfoulement physique. Le sentiment de libert s'y trouve plus dans le travail sur les sensations lies  l'nergie interne.|`|VR3cG3pTaa	pour un bon pratiquant les 2 sont indissociable le kung fu est sans conteste l' un des meilleurs arts martiaux car tres complet|`|b4557bf985eea4b50b9bc08264375469aa	l n'est pas la question papillon

851iD1uDaa	The answer is probably no.  The fact is that they have a professional softball league that is growing slowly but surely.  If they could get softball players to be household names, professional softball would be infinitely better than womens basketball.  Softball has everything baseball has with a little bit faster pace.  Sure, the players aren't as good as MLB players but some of those girls have talent.  My girlfriend plays college softball now and I have been going to the games and actually getting into them.  It is actually quite exciting if you really care which team wins.|`|38d6d7d6011bdd646925e15a23ec4590aa	that would be cool|`|AA10463170	There was a minor league team out of Colorado a few years back that was managed by Phil Neikro the former Atl. Braves pitcher|`|YkKzg99saa	There was one in the '40s and '50s, but there won't be another one.  Women's sports just do not draw enough interest to carry a league.  It's a shame, but it is what it is.  The pro soccer league folded, the basketball league that wasn't propped up by the NBA folded, and the WNBA would probably go away too if it weren't for the NBA keeping it going.|`|8f1441245a202704a65deff2448f9c98aa	Fastpitch softball, IMO, is a much funner sport to watch.  I was a huge baseball fan all my life and in college I discovered softball.  I prefer it.  There is a small pro league going for girls right now.  I hope that  there is expansion.  But like someone else on here said, no one watches WNBA, and softball will be the same.  Do you ever see the pro softball games televised??  Very rarely.|`|0686e457a634ce1e335c836cdfa1f056aa	No. There basketball games are every bit as good and exciting as men's games but no one watches. Baseball would be the same way.     Besides, they play softball in high school so if anything they should start a fast-pitch softball league for women.|`|0hEhvulHaa	Actually there was a pro baseball league for women... a movie was based on it.... remember 'A League of their Own".    "Are you crying? Are you crying!  There's no crying.  There's no crying in baseball!!"... Classic    But no there will never be a pro baseball league for women again, since they all play softball.

Le club parisien voit d'ailleurs loin puisqu'il n'exclut pas,  terme, d'attaquer un pays mergent : "un pays mergent comme les Etats-Unis, footballistiquement s'entend, nous intresse particulirement car les cibles y sont encore  des prix accessibles, avec un potentiel de march considrable.

851iD1uDaa	David Ortiz and Travis Hafner are really good designated hitters.  When an NL team comes to an AL park, they use the DH.  When an AL team comes to a NL park, they do not use the DH rule.|`|JbgnuDeZaa	The best DH ever was Harold Baines.  Many better players have played DH for a year or two, but the DH was Baines' primary spot.  When the AL plays the NL in an NL park there is no DH.  When the AL plays the NL in an AL park the DH is used.|`|AA11612795	Don't know about stats, but whether or not the DH rule is used depends on which league is hosting the game.  If the game is in an AL stadium, the DH is used and if the game is in a NL stadium, then the pitchers have to hit.

Even about 1,000 guys dressed up like Hulk Hogan! That's why I love wrestling. The environment is unmistakable, and impossible to replicate.|`|eKcw9huxaa	the rey mysterio part is the coolest..  but about the fu or the stfu|`|Qchzjsjcaa	YOU FORGOT THE WORM!!!!!    oh and Somoan Spike.....a f'n thumb to the head.

851iD1uDaa	See if you can get a little more out of the trade.  I wouldn't do it straight up myself.  I don't think that Upton will break out yet this season but don't hold me to that.  Zimmerman is a reliable hitter who will give you good numbers all year.  It might be worth it only because you do not have a good second baseman.  See if you can get a quality third or second baseman along with Upton.  Then I would consider making the trade.|`|bNlYFkB3aa	No, be patient, it's only been 5 games so far. Uptron will perform good, but Zimmerman will do better. And TB has another Japanese 3B who has been hitting even better and is not drafted in most leagues. I forget his name though, but he won't be hard to find using batter statistics in your search.    Pz|`|AA10613925	I wouldn't do it normally, but since you need a 2B, go for it. Upton will get you a good number of steals, and while his power numbers are not as good, he will be a decent 2B option.|`|97162933b1bad1dd90eb6c6301e0cd2faa	I agree with one of the earlier respondants....you can get more for Zimmerman than just BJ Upton.  Upton does have great upside this year, and will easily smoke Zimmerman in steals.  However, Zimmerman is a better hitter, and like you said, is more reliable.    I'd say see what you can get in addition to Upton for him.  If all he's willing to give you is Upton, then stick with what you've got (Zimmerman).|`|AA10479433	Do not trade...Unless you can pick up a 2nd player that will benifit your team...Too tit  for tat, why trade?|`|CXw0nqUeaa	I would not do this trade, or even consider it. Upton is the starting 2nd basemen right now, and has started off hot, but Ryan Zimmerman is possibly a top 3-4 3rd basemen (he had over 100 RBI his rookie year). You should be able to get a higher quality 2nd baseman if thats where your needs lie (looking at who you have it must be), see if you can grab a Brian Roberts or Robinson Cano from another team, those would be a fair trade for a player at the caliber of Zimm.
HaisMqM0aa	First off, drop Perez and Patterson. They don't need to be on any team in a 10 team league. Mussina is hurt, I wouldn't hang on to him. He'll get you some wins but for me its not worth the headache. I cant figure out how you have 5 guys in the top 30: Beltran, Rodriguez, Abreu, Young, and Wells in a 10 team league.    Don't do it, Jered Weaver is going to be hurt all year. A Beltran for Pujols trade would be interesting, but giving up Thome for Weaver is giving up WAY too much.    Nice team!|`|9becc505b49fd9ac4f97f5a314ff2f2aaa	no.|`|6e3cebd48699619f690fd10d6dcac5a2aa	yes|`|fb6673ae4d70f1126e72b638e1f9511caa	I cant think of many pitchers who start the season with arm trouble and then not have arm trouble during the year. Plus, you are already taking up roster spots with Clemens (pitching in June maybe?) and Gagne (MR. DL). Plus you know Patterson is good for one or two DL trips. Avoid more DL trouble and stick with what you have.|`|851iD1uDaa	No way.  Pujols is just one player and he always has a chance of getting injured.  The guys you have should produce plenty for you and not all of the will be injured at the same time.  Thome may be in a slump, but he will come out of it and get you 100 RBI along with Beltran.  Wever is a great young prospect who could have another great year.  It is not worth it at all.|`|h3XjUNZuaa	I think i might actually.  Albert Pujols has been the top 2 hitters in the game for the past three years, and he is hitting hi slump early.  He will hit 300 and hit 40 long balls.  Beltran is a career 275ish hitter and has hit 40 hr once in his career.  People seem to be trying to get rid of albert since his struggling early but 150 games down the road i would expect him to be the better choice.  I would take pujols over thome as well.   Jared Weaver  and his elbow tendonitits are a concern just bc already two of them are on the DL but i think it is a reasonable risk to take.  Not that a healthy weaver is a risk.  but you are going to get plenty of hr and rbis with your roster and just as easy as weaver getting hurt thome could get hurt being 37 even though injury was never a problem til his last season in philly.    If i were you i would take the trade.  I see it as a risk-reward scenario but i feel that this trade would not be around say in mid may when pujols comes alive.  Besides hes got 15 games against the reds whom he owns, and more than half are in that tball field by the river...My poor reds..

A608gfCWaa	if you're going for the high school squad, I'd say go to ocean city. My sister has been a  cheerleader for 7 years and she has been on the jv team  in her high school for 3 years. now that its her senior year next year, she made it to varsity. So if you're inexperienced and you  want to make it into a high school team, id say go to ocean city and maybe ask your parents about a gymnastics summer program instead another time or session. If you arent going to be a senior next year just remember there are plenty more years left. besides cheerleading can get expensive without strong fun raisers when it comes to compettitions/uniform/registration. my sister had to pay $2000 to get to florida to be in a compettition (which they won nationals). You could also try to sign up for an out of school squad which usually permits anyone who gives registration money. hope i helped. (:|`|bSaoPZqvaa	1.Yes if you try hard enough  2.Yes go to Ocean city with your buds!|`|AA11900163	I suggest  1. I was a cheerleader for 7 years and a coach for 3 years. It is very fun & challenging. Also, by going to camp you will get to see if you have the skills to do the sport or you may find you don't even like it at all. Whatever you decide, good luck!|`|f1M83u1Eaa	Dedication is one of the first things a coach will look for, that and potential. So you don't have to be a first class cheerleader to begin with. You have to show that you are a hard worker, and show progress. I'm sure if you really want to do it, you'll be able to.    As for the friends thing, it really depends on how much you really want to be a cheerleading. Cheerleading takes sacrifice, and you have to work hard at it. And I'm sure you'd have fun with your friends, but do you really want to give up that easily?    Of course, the final choice is yours. But I hope I helped you weigh out your options better.

aTkPvZQuaa	of course.....................|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Yep.

Goals will come from Keane!|`|579ead28e9d00c58a1acf116af0f06faaa	Yes, wether he scores 20m pounds worth is another matter and by that I mean at least 17 a season. He's leaving it late but has to get used to different coaching, positions now and again and playing with better players who keep the ball on the ground more. (Especially now overated peter has gone). Bit of pressure too, but for a footballers wage, you step up to the plate. No sympathy.|`|ffaa39282a55af5a79f48b8f556dcb8caa	Liverpool's purchase of Keane was a great deal, at least for Spurs.  I have never rated him and he is a lot older than his years suggest.   Yes he will score eventually for Liverpool, but the scousers will never see a return for their outlay.|`|54DwDrRZaa	he will and once he does, he'll be on fire. everyone will have to run for cover    hopefully|`|RqkITQUiaa	yes|`|uUitKmJMaa	yeah he prob will!  sure if he doesnt hes a great addition to the squad!set up fernandos goal today!and u can see he partnership starting to work!  no doubt tho he will score!|`|z6paOEkiaa	lol, doubt it|`|VOjwq5aXaa	Will Liverpool Ever stop Wasting such a incredible Talent?|`|NgZlz5K7aa	Now he's finally been put up front, yes

Surely there is a way you can check it out through the soccer agent thing you are a member with? if he's asking for money up front tell him to sod off, or contact the club and see if they know anything about it or him, contact your local FA they should be able to help you.

A "black" person, mostly westen african in origin, not ethiopian, has for the same weight in muscle as a "white" person, lets say european in origin, has a lot more fast twitch fibres.     That means that a black guy with the same size body will actually be stronger though a white guy will have more endurance (assuming his brain is capable of it).

RbCry06Taa	There are 40,000 Filipinos in UK and add to that the friends and families that could be British of those 40,000 Filipinos so yes there will be people rooting for the Pacman in England. However it will still be a fraction of Hatton's supporters of course.    To counteract your question, are there any fans outside UK that will be rooting for Hatton? Of course there will be but Manny's fan base totally outnumbers Hatton's fan base outside UK.    I dont know why some people only thinks that it is only Filipinos who are fan and rooters of Manny Pacquiao. they would be surprised to know how many non-Filipino rooters are there for Manny specially in the US.|`|YlKyUjf1aa	some people dont care for race when it comes to boxing, but ricky hatton will have the majority of UK, though pacqiao will have some uk fans|`|vDvxaevcaa	There is for sure.

e4roTumKaa	Gee a bit harsh in my book, Clarke hasn't done a lot wrong, it certainly wasn't his fault Symonds decided to go fishing in Darwin and what he does with Lara his there own business, his recent form has been OK so lets ease up a bit and let him get on playing some decent cricket, we need all the help we can get at the moment.    That is a worry Bingalee, I must be getting soft|`|ResOYx5Naa	i dont think he has done anything to affect the captaincy but the guy is a fool he has a tatoo of lara on his arm for christs sake wat is he like 15. it doesnt take a genius to realise that the reason y micheal clarke is not goin to the IPL is beacause of lara bingle.|`|3AJ0H1D3aa	What a beat up. I have not seem Clarke do anything to under mind Ponting on or off the field. How quickly we forget all of Punters Pass issues . Why do you think he is called Punter plus the alcohol problem. All in the past. sure why not. How about his present on field performances. Yes he has scored some runs but I would be looking at his decisions. Field placement, Blowing changes, Time management. Sure he has lost a few players from his team. But he also has to much input in to the selection of his team.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	Clarke will be captain soon but his marriage will last     when he retires from cricket Lara Bingle will be after some other player or sportsman in the limelight     she is no good for him|`|LzkujA3Faa	Well, i think they are blowing the whole thing out of proportion. Clarke is definitely capable of taking over the captaincy of Australia, when Ponting retires. What does it matter if he is  media-savvy, with the cool looks and a hot girlfriend? i think it is a bit harsh to say he should be sacked from vice -captaincy.     Currently Ponting is our captain and it will remain that way but Clarke is definitely capable of takng over the big job when his time comes.|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	"Clarke kissing Bingle like a lovestruck teenager at AB medal night" Ha, doesnt that say it all... He has to choose between being captain or being Lara's boyfriend or not let Lara interfere with what he's doing (which is leading the team) thus the altercation between himself and Katich.|`|0QBKiP2naa	Clarke will show he is captain material unlike Ponting who is a pathetic capatin who has hidden behind great players for 2 long now his inadequate skills are showing.Ponting needs to be dumped as captain as do the selectors|`|fsLMFIpgaa	No I don't & I posted a comment on the Telegraph website to that effect.I think there are some people who don't want Clarke to get the captaincy & they leak these stories to the media for spite.I think he will make a fine captain & wish him all the best of luck in getting it soon.    Edit: Surprisingly, I agree with The Money Man on this ocassion|`|AA11088802	that is shocking news|`|tz7JEqstaa	Quite honestly...No.  I hope Ponting remains captain for another 4-5 years.    Edit  Not bashing Clarke, I'm just a Ponting fan
f9hiPMDxaa	It is fair. These players have contracts with their County clubs and now they want to get away from them to play IPL.|`|k2y36hPkaa	I think it's fair.

I mean, you can't have the cake and eat it too! They are getting some easy cash by playing in the IPL. So what's the big trouble with giving the couties 10%. After all, it is only 10%!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Maybe ECB hopes it will deter players from going to IPL? But it seems fair enough to me.|`|e4roTumKaa	More than fair, always good to see the Poms getting screwed!!
rseD4OG2aa	I think that John Cena would have been a great fit in the Attitude Era. It would have allowed him to be edgier and if you've seen any of his old "5 Questions with the Champ" clips then it's easy to see that he can be edgy if he wants to be.   The Attitude Era was all about long and controversial promos and Cena would have been able to do that well either as a face or as a heel. He's really funny on the mic and that would have been perfect for the time. Can you imagine the type of promos that would have happened in a Cena-Rock feud?  I think that Randy Orton would have done well in the Attitude Era as well. While he's a hated heel today, he still has a massive following. That would have been perfect for the Attitude Era, where the popular heels got over big time. His mic skills aren't the best but his whole viper like Legend Killer gimmick would have been great.

But Rondo averages 5 rebounds per game and 8.1 assists per game. Williams only averages 3.3 and 4.2 per game. Overall, the efficiency formula (Efficiency Formula: ((PTS + REB + AST + STL + BLK) - ((FGA - FGM) + (FTA - FTM) + TO)) / G) Rondo has  a 18.4 to Williams 15.77.

rGGymoowaa	If your talking about sponsorship money and TV ratings in the USA then the PGA  is ahead, but not necessarily around the world. As tennis decide to not put all their eggs in 1 country like the PGA did and promote  its self as an international sport. So the gap isn't a big as you may think.     In fact the prize money for the WTA has increased 23% since 2008 and the Australian Open increased their purse by 12%. It's much better for women tennis players on the WTA then LPGA.      Roger Federer  does very well in endorsements around the world despite not really being promoted that much in America. ATP is increasing prize money as well for 2009 and signed 2 major sponsors.South American Airways for $20 million and Barclays is the sponsor for the end of year tournament ,ATP WORLD TOUR FINALS, 5 years for $30 million.      Besides I never understood why every one worries so much about whats popular. After all if you enjoy Tennis then that's all that matters.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	No. Rich people play golf as a display of class. It's a sport, playing golf is just not as simple as u think. It needs tremendous amount of focus like in tennis, and it needs a lot of techniques and skills like tennis does too. The difference is that much stress will be put on a golfer's waist strength to make turning; while playing tennis used up almost all part of muscle in the body. U dislike it, so u say it's not a rich/popular sport. If u dislike tennis, u would say the same to tennis too. So do many other people. To sum up, tennis and golf are rich in different ways and are played by different people all over the world. I love tennis but have very limited interest for golf..|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	no doubt less played? Look it up, Golf is the number 1 most played sport in the world.|`|hCLmczgMaa	the richest sport is actually NASCAR. yep NASCAR... what has the world come to?|`|8qtm4qkUaa	More people play golf; more people watch golf; therefore sponsors will pay more for golf tournaments.    Also, golf has shown itself over the years to have a lot more players capable of winning any tournament. Tiger Woods has disguised that fact a bit, but the gap between the top couple of golfers in the world and the rest is a lot smaller, and can disappear more quickly, than the gap between say Federer and Nadal. The top tennis players are usually so much better than everyone else.    The top golfers can stay on top for longer, too. Roger Federer won't be making the semi-finals of Wimbledon when he's 53, but Greg Norman could come third in the British Open at that age. That creates more appeal for sponsors and fans, who can spend more years following their favourite players.    If you find golf boring, that's your call. That doesn't mean that the general sports watching public agree with that. I don't - I like watching and playing both! Tennis is definitely easier to be competent at than golf, which is an unnnaturally impossible sport to play!|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Golf is a sport invented for the weak.  Anything where guys are riding around in carts, drinking alchohol, is NOT a sport.  Tennis can beat golf any day.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	i play BOTH tennis and golf, i agree that tennis is more exciting than golf, but golf players have much better longetivity than tennis players.    u can play golf competitively until your hips give way when you are healthy and 70.    but with tennis, players normally do not play for more than 10 years competitively.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	nah|`|iyDXt5d9aa	I think it's really sad what's happening to tennis's reputation. People here in the states don't go for it. I can't figure out why, but I think that players like the amazin Rafa are really helpin it's popularity. And for golf to be richer is just...like a slap in the face to the tennis world!!|`|DEDmq2OWaa	Well let's see, Golf can be played by people seriously out of shape- It's the 'old boys club' sport- lot's of money put into it- can't stand watching it, my oh my boring- playing is different- nothing like a small white ball causing you to scream like a baby..... and what other sport has beer cart access while you play...Tennis on the other hand is all about athletics- and requires more endurance and stamina.|`|uafHjillaa	I like tennis very much, and I don't like very much golf because it's less popular than tennis, well I think that but I don't know if it's true    and actually I don't like that sport,      Which player do you like? Nadal or Roger   I like both, they are awesome!!|`|gpvlsTbqaa	haha while i like tennis alot better..  I'd have to say golf is a really hard sport..  not any out of shape, fat person could play it  If you're not swinging the club right, you can easily injure yourself  its mostly about calculating  hitting a tiny ball into a hole thats just a little bit bigger than the ball and is really far away is REALLY hard  But... Tennis is faster paced and more fun to me =]

tUEPx0q2aa	The only way to make it truly better is taking time out to consistently practice at it. If aren't already comfortable with it as you are left then chances are no amount of practice will replace natural ability.    My one piece of advice is just practice twice as much with your left as you do your right. Whether that is against a wall or with a buddy. Its about building up "muscle memory" so it becomes a reflex.     Dont concentrate or high or how fast. concentrate on making precise short passes or being able to volley with your left, this will be more useful in a game.    Look at professional soccer players; only a handful are as good with their left as they are their right....    Hope that helps|`|N0sbhRu6aa	If you have dumbbells hold it with your left hand and do a calf raise. Do lunges too. Do 30 you will feel the burn. The weight must be heavy enough then when you do a bicep curl, you can only do 10. This is perfect.    The first guy is right about practicing your left foot. The wall is the best practice for football.|`|oDh1dF3Qaa	Shoot with it more than your right...try it for some time, it can happen. Did you know that David Villa had an injury to his right leg when he was younger, and as a result had to learn it in that fashion? Now, he can shoot with both feet.  So practice, practice, practice, and you'll nail it.  Good luck!|`|xYg0Vx3laa	adda boy im happy people wanna be ambedixteriss at soccer, but it should come natruelly if it doesnt then there is alot of work to be done, ive been trained by international coaches around the world from brazil to russia and the best advice i give you is to shun you're left foot, well if u practice like me........... find a nice wall, pass against it one touch with your left foot about 10 er 20 or even 30 yards out ONE TOUCH, w/ the left foot, now,, just to make sure u dont loose your right foot pass less then the left. but nun theless make sure the ball is on the ground pass 90 times against the wall with left the 30 with right, fundementals are important and in order to be the next cristiano ronaldo, practice does NOT MAKE PERFECT. PERFECT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!!                                         GOOD luck man,
z7JsVzcnaa	40" is the standard, but it's perfectly fine to play with a shorter or longer shaft.  The rule book says that a goalie stick can measure in from anywhere between 42" and 60" in total length, including the head.    You should absolutely get the goalie gloves.  They have added thumb protection that reduces the chance of injuring your thumb.  I've seen a few goalies take shots off their thumbs and be saved by the fact that they were wearing goalie gloves.|`|WiIUEObTaa	please use the gloves. seem uncomfortable at first. will break in. as far as the stick. shaft length up to your armpit. cut shaft. extensions added or new shaft as you grow. good luck

q4YGEjS4aa	Long toss long toss long toss.  If you can get outside where its warm enough. (first off i like you less,lol  I have three feet of snow on the ground)   Start your regular warm up at about 30 feet, progress once your warm.  Add 15 feet at a time and focus on throwing on the line.  Meaning try to have the ball flying out of your hand on a level plane.  So it doesn't look like a pop fly. More like a line drive.    Work at each distance for a couple minutes each.  Work up to about 120 150 feet.  about a throw from home to second or little more.  Do this every day you can,  you MUST LISTEN TO YOUR ARM.  Pain is never a good thing.  It's not like hockey or football you dont' ever want to throw through the pain.      If your arms isn't feeling pain, just normal soreness from working out the muscles keep this up til your throws are strong and on the line.  Accuracy is more important that speed and distance.  Good firm line drive throws will be good.      I don't recommend weightlifting.  It's too late to be affectvie this season.  Talk to your coach about set up a work out routine for the offseason and during season.  He should be able to help you for the long term.    Besides the extra long toss, make sure you are stretching and warming up properly.   Remember you can't try out if your hurt.    Good luck.  And from now til forever, hussle hussle hussle.

WbUrwR2Haa	doing two sports in the same season for high school (double-rostering) is usually banned but find out by asking either your coach or school athletic director.    a right wing midfielder has many responsibilities    u could be playing a 4-4-2 formation (find out) which is this  --------1--------2------  ---3----4------5------6  --7-----8------9------10  ----------11--------------    11 players on a team, and in the diagram you would be number 6 (the numbers dont mean anything here if you're confused i just wanted to give each position a number) with the GK being number 11 here.     Now, the some of the traditional qualities of a right wing midfielder are strength, great speed and acceleration and a good touch on the ball.    you have to work on running with the ball quickly and not letting the ball get away from you but maintaining control which can be quickly defined as having the ball in your possession     watch this video as it will sum it up what an amazing right wing looks like     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAiyAMU9H...    this is Arsenal winger theo walcott's mazy run versus Liverpool in the Champions League. Watch as     1.) watch at :46 how Walcott CONTROLs the ball as its going all wacky and bouncing very well and is able to keep running at high speed without having to waste time to control the ball because in soccer wasting time is the difference between winning and losing.    2.) next, see at :48 as one of the Liverpool (red shirts) players attempts to foul Walcott but his STRENGTH enables him to come away from the attack at speed and able to continue the play.    3.) from :50 on he takes an incredible burst of SPEED which enables him to beat two more men in order to set up Adebayor (the guy who scored the goal) to score.    a Right wing mid should be able to do the following    control a ball in the air (the ball is coming in the air, not you in the air controlling the ball)    crossing    shooting     maintaining possesion of the ball    intelligence    awareness    creativity    speed    strength    control    technique    GOOD LUCK!|`|N0sbhRu6aa	LOL    why don't you actually go to google and research what a winger does.|`|NQ7xT9jVaa	when your an outside mid you have to do a lot of running but you have to help on defense and usually outside mid carries the ball up the field on the outside then cross the ball in to the fowards....playing goalie is all about positioning and anything to keep the ball out of the goal|`|7dqmg9z5aa	no, you cant do both.  dont be a keeper because it is a harder position to play if you dont understand the game.|`|le1FkkBTaa	Of course you can do both.

Yvon Labre.      Can you tell me anything about him without looking him up?  Neither can 99% of Capitals fans.    Yvon Labre's number was retired (and I quote Abe Pollin on this) because he was the last player playing who played in the Capitals first game.  Labre also scored the very first Capitals goal in Landover.  He was also the captain for a while, he's also been a scout, assistant coach, and broadcaster for the team.  He's a lifelong Capital.    But is Labre HHOF material?  Not even close.|`|2octF5dIaa	NO.  To get a retired number is like the HOF of that team.  You have to be better than the rest of the league like a retired number player is better than the rest of his team.  Adam Graves, for example, will not make the HOF and got his number retired in New York.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	No. The Islanders retired "Mr. Islander" Bob Nystrom's  23 back in 1995, but there is no way he will be in the HOF.  It was more for his hard work and contributions to the team and Long Island, both on and off the ice. FYI, his was also the last   they have retired.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	On a smaller level. It is the equivalent of making the "Teams" Hall of Fame if there was such a thing.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Far from it. I mean no disrespect to Greg and the other Ranger fans here but aside from his 52 goal season and ONE cup ring as a Ranger (93-94) and another as a 3rd-liner with the 89-90 Oilers, he hasn't done all that much.

QTd8MVDjaa	Your best bet would be to get a bare molle vest and add pod holders and a tank holder. That way you can add or take off things to fit the gametype or situation. The cheapest molle vest is here:    http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/SearchRes...    Then you can buy things like pod holders, a tank holder, pouches, radio pouches, etc. You can buy different paintball molle accessories at www.opsgear.com or www.specialopspaintball.com. Vest aren't cheap, but this is the best way to make your own custom vest on the cheaper side. Hope this helps!
QcmNHRzyaa	on a 90ci easily a full case of paint. also it depends on how efficient your marker is|`|mRJk26MTaa	The average is 15 shots per ci on a 4500psi tank.    15x90=1350    So you'll get around 1350 shots from it. Maybe more or maybe less, depending on the gun.|`|qE49jbVaaa	steelers|`|iqNcXWsOaa	There is no general rule. It purely depends on the gun. Some guns are high pressure and will use more air per shot. Some are a low pressure set up and use less air.

8UTJ0kFNaa	I would rather have Jay Cutler. Baby Chucky Rivers is an overrated crybaby.|`|xP08melDaa	Phillip Rivers is so much more consistent... Jay Cutler is a flop and won't get anywhere in his career... atleast Rivers (I think) will win a couple of superbowls|`|KTp27Fokaa	I'll take Cutler. He can make a ton of tough throws and makes them when he needs to. He has led his team to more 4th quarter comebacks than Rivers already, while Rivers played over 10 games more. Cutler doesn't have conduct problems, unlike Rivers, which can't stay calm if any call goes against him.    Cutler did worse because his team has no defense. Rivers has a HOF running back and a much better defense than Jay Cutler ever had in his 2.5 years starting. Cutler had to carry a team with a bad defense and 7 running backs on IR. I'd say 8-8 and the  2 offense in the NFL despite that is pretty damn impressive.|`|rM9WzIkHaa	rivers of course hes had more wins more experiance   i think hes good people need to give him more credit|`|30LMCJrAaa	Cutler. Steady, cool under pressure, leader on the team.    Rivers is a hot head and doesn't take to authority. He is a distraction.|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	Phil Rivers.  He is a better QB than Cutler.  Rivers has a better arm, more accuracy and is a better all around athelete. Cutler is too soft...weak...AND he throws like a girl.  Tee-Hee!!!      GO CHARGERS 2009!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Philip Rivers by far!    He is a great on the field leader, and he doesn't get into trouble off the field.  He lead the league in passer rating, and threw for 34 TDs against only 11 INT.  While Jay Cutler threw for 25 TDs against 18 INT.  Yes, Cutler did throw for 500 more yards than Rivers, but the Broncos didnt have a running game, the Chargers did.|`|0SdX6MpWaa	I'd rather have a QB who must win his last 3 games to make the playoffs, rather than one that only has to win 1 and chokes    So what I'm getting at is Rivers|`|AA10495394	Right now give me rivers but I am a Raiders fan so I hate them both|`|RDdhVnksaa	Cutler is much better then River!|`|Z4RW26pZaa	Who the hell is Cutler?... This kid hasn't accomplished anything, he hasn't even been to the playoffs when it was sitting right there for him    Rivers proved to be big last season, and he truly carried his team, the Chargers relied on the passing game, rather than L.T and the running game|`|VoKzvoxKaa	Culter    He is in Pro Bowl.  Philip Isn't|`|iTprmvFzaa	A lot of people hate Philip  Philip deserved the pro bowl more than cutler did.  Guess its cuz of the chargers losing record|`|m7BFxtBkaa	Oh easy. Philip Rivers no contest. He gets better numbers than Cutler without having the luxury of working with Brandon Marshall and Eddie Royal.|`|O0b9Kiosaa	Rivers|`|lj7KRNEcaa	Cutler. Phillip "Cry me a" Rivers sucks so much.|`|bsApizbxaa	Rivers by farrr    Last time I checked, the Chargers had Absolutely no defense, and no running game, L.T had his worst season.|`|SMX228Olaa	Jay Cutler because Phillip Rivers is a little punk who trash talks to other players when he knows they would own him.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	rivers in a second  jay is a little girl with diabetes|`|AA11645255	jay cutler any day. cutler has a more powerful arm, is cooler under pressure, and is smarter. rivers is too much of a hot head. you give cutler a running game, and that broncos offense becomes pretty lethal.    there's a reason shanahan was in love with cutler. he thought he had found his next elway. the only reason the broncos were in the playoff hunt this year was because of cutler. cutler carried that offense and had to put up a ton of points because the broncos' defense couldn't stop anybody.

The skills competition is the best part of it, anyway.|`|StuXqez7aa	After I clear Rob Blagojevich of all charges|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Naw.  The Pro Bowl has turned into nothing but a popularity contest.  About 5 or 10 years ago, when you said someone went to the Pro Bowl 7 times, you where like WOW!  But now its just like, yeah whatever.  And they've put to many rules on it.  Like the one that you can't blitz the QB.  I mean cummon.  There are usually 3 or 4 players that go to the Pro Bowl just because they are good as rushing the QB, and most of those players can't cover to save their lives.  So, they go to the Pro Bowl, and they aren't allowed to rush the QB.  So that forces them to drop back in coverage, which they stink at.  So those players who are really good, stink in the Pro Bowl.  And there's also a rule that says the DBs can't "press cover" unless the offense is inside the 10 yard line.  So in the last Pro Bowl, one of the NFCs WRs caught the ball and got tackled at the 11 yard line.  So, the CB for the AFC couldn't press cover the WR, and the NFC got a TD.|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	No one actually watches the entire Pro Bowl. The best part is the skills competition, it happens before the game during the Pro Bowl Weekend. You probably will see it on NFL Network.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	I can't sit through any of it!!!!|`|rM9WzIkHaa	i love football, but i've never actually watched the pro bowl|`|LVjM9k8yaa	I probably won't watch any of it.

QG7hSAQcaa	I played tennis all through high school and that's happened to me before as well.  Since its your first year I'm guessing you lost probably because you are practicing using all of the correct techniques while your opponent was focusing on just getting the ball over the net.  So while you were working on hitting the ball correctly he was more consistent on getting the ball in bounds therefore winning the game.  It just takes time and practice, once you get the technique down you wont have any problem winning matches.|`|sptrtwxlaa	because he was so bad he was good. You made too many errors and he unintentionally cheap shotted you|`|or13ywBmaa	Yeah you let your guard down cause you thought he sucked and he ended up beating you|`|lNlL0Ag2aa	Ya that was definitely a mental game and just know that losing to someone doesn't mean that he's better than you, just get a rematch and don't worry if you'll lose the next one.    But remember that the MOST IMPORTANT thing in tennis, besides serving, is not how hard you hit the ball, but how consistently the ball is in. I'm sure your friend won by not by how many winners he made, but by how many unforced errors you made. The trick is to not try to make any winners, but try to keep getting the ball in play at different spots until he makes an unforced errors.     DON'T TAKE RISKS UNTIL YOU GAIN THE LEAD. I personally take a huge risk when I'm 2 points ahead and my next point wins the mini-game.|`|cTcX7vumaa	you probably do what a lot of people do..including myself...when u play a player worse than u, u often play to their ability... its usually the same when u play a player beater than u..u might not always beat them..but u often play better against them|`|iyDXt5d9aa	that definitely happens to me sometimes!! I think it's just the frustration when they start scorin on ya, ya kinda drop your game a little because ya just wanna start hittin impressive shots back at them. I believe its all mental. I seem tot always hit a mental block in my game, its awful!!!|`|qykk5MvIaa	yeah it was totally mental . in a game, you should not underestimate ppl, because it can bite you later on. i should know because i am always underestimated. i am like a skinny 5 ft 3 asian boy and no one thinks i can hit. in the end i made them sweat like crazy. also if his shots are lucky, then you cant do nothing about it, but you can still beat him if you play consistence with spin.

KR3IvxNwaa	first : only use 4-4-2, 4-1-3-2, or 4-2-3-1 formation in FIFA because other formations won't work very well.    second : fullback and winger are important,, good fullback will go forward more often,, while good winger will make a crossing more dangerous.    third : always use at least 1 striker who has 6'1 height or taller and at least 1 strong center midfielder.    fourth : never put too many star players on your team.    fifth : i would suggest to change Rooney with someone very strong in the air like Toni, Adebayor, Kuranyi, Gomez, Amauri, or Fabiano.|`|5YKMYcxWaa	its sh*t, vidic is a CB. fabregas is an attacking midfielder aswell a s gerrard.|`|Hiasgb75aa	You have no Left Back. No Defensive Midfielder.     Messi and Rooney are both awful in the air and they both play deep.    Just because you have a bunch of superstars wont make your team good. Good width without anyone to win the headers, Fabregas playing in a defensive role, Vidic at Left Back. Its kind of a mess. It needs balancing|`|6804d2ea631ce65559290fe3d62aa897aa	u have a great set of players but that is not enough.  in FIFA the game revolves around the midfield. so you need to rearrange your team to bring more players to midfield.   Defensive mid is an unnecessary waste of talent and personally I feel 3 good defenders are enough .  So basically choose 3 defenders, 4/5 midfielders and 3/2 attackers.

wJufC06Qaa	Pwah, that's a pretty big board for you missy! You may want to consider a smaller board for future contests if you're planning to progress further in your turning (ie. digging the rail) and aerial manouvres.     However, I think your problem lies in your balance on your back foot. If you have a tail pad with a tail block, push your back foot up against that to control the tail. It might also help moving your front foot a tiny bit foward for further control.    Hope I helped!|`|WRpkUGcHaa	if you want to put that move in a contest, i would suggest doing a floater on the close-out section which will be (usually) smaller--that way, you've already bagged some points if you fall. the other 3 guys gave good advice---you have to bend, you have to control your board and you HAVE to turn toward the beach when learning this. i think starting on smaller close-outs will help alot too.|`|RZfoszJFaa	Keep your weight back when coming down and be sure to keep your legs bent while your on top so your not pencil straight when you come down. Practice tucked the whole time and let the wave bring you down. It might not be the prettiest style but you will get more comfortable with the move. That's all I could say without watching you.

The pitch was high and just a little inside, almost over the plate. Manny was fined for acting like an idiot, Clemens was not. The whole thing was started by Pedro who hit Karim Garcia in the head because the Yankees were hitting him hard. Zimmer was the only one who had the guts to go after Pedro, something the Yankees should have done for years. Manny was mad because tension was high after Pedro threw at Garcia, and he overreacted to a pitch that was not meant to hit him. Both benches had been warned after the fight, and Clemens was not tossed out.

Berto is just not ready to face the top 3 guys at Welter.   I would like to see him against Clottey though.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	So long as the Margarito loss didn't take too much out of Cotto, he should easily beat Berto.  I think Cotto is a level above Berto skill wise and should take this one.|`|14b55b2c0493a3dba8b107800bc6ac4aaa	With the understanding that Margarito handwrap misture with the hardening substance before the Mosley fight the speculation is that the beating Cotto took from Margarito was actually done with brass knuckles so to speak!     Lets say Margarito didnt use that stuff in Cotto's fight, you think Cotto would have still lost? Cotto slowed down only because of the damages he suffered from those blows! Which today we can clearly understand how that happened! (Cheating)     Berto would not have a chance against Cotto's body blows and combinations.  It would be a great fight for Cotto's momentum as he will build and capitalize on a great victory.     Cotto hands down!|`|q1IRjYAyaa	berto lost to luis collazo so i predict cotto will beat berto easily!|`|7domw3t5aa	I would love to see berto fight cotto.

Jennings is relatively unkown so we don't know if he is a threat or not and Cotto took a beating against Margarito so we need to see if he is the same fighter.  If he is I think Cotto can beat Berto because Bertos defense is not the best, and I think Cotto handles speed well, he beat two of the fastest fighters today, Judah and Mosely.

I'm a huge Stoudemire fan.|`|ewW1CY3Waa	CAVS fro BIG BEN|`|GBGcI509aa	Not bad.|`|Ov3BANfRaa	this is ridiuculos for the suns to lose him. he's the best player on their team plus this tade wouldn't work out. amare for a bunch of scrubs please. the suns wouldn't be able to compete down low and they would lose a lot of points in the paint and get out rebounded|`|dDhTMacAaa	ohh come on man|`|xeEOTsyYaa	You might want to through in a 2015 second round pick.
dqy7DdoSaa	That is an interesting question I was thinking the same thing myself why buy Given when they have a reasonable goalkeeper in Hart(that sprint against Man U was magnificent).    I know Given is good but he isn't in the worlds top 5 goalkeepers I think Man City just flashed the money around because they can.    Shay Given will take the number 1 spot with Joe Hart on the bench.    Now we also have to think of the young Kasper Schmeichel who was the back up keeper to Hart he basically has little to no chance of a game with 2 other goalkeepers in front of him.|`|QuGTZJIVaa	He'll benefit from Given's proven Premier League experience.  He's been too complacent as of late.  Hart is one for the future. Given is what we need right now.|`|oDh1dF3Qaa	He'll be a benchwarmer unless:  1. Given gets injured (a usually rare thing for goalies, but hey, it happens)  2. Or he gets out in the summer transfer window and goes to a club that's in need of a starting goalie.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	he will move to the other club. he is not deserve to be a sub.|`|Hiasgb75aa	I feel sorry for him. Obviously he knows he is not going to be their main man for at least 4 years. Thats if he can be bothered to stay there till then. Eventually he'll probably move on, like a lot of City's young stars|`|Xbgd5h8zaa	he will probably be a sub|`|py25T599aa	2nd string
QTd8MVDjaa	Well, there isn't a "best" deck per se. But the Almost Uber decks are one of the best. They cost about $100 though. But that's the "best deck" I guess. Any wheel that has dual durometer will be great.
88uIjItaaa	Stuart Kirby  51 Chevy?    If I remember correctly I use to always watch him when he raced back than. I liked his name.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Competitive Edge Motorsports fielded  51 Marathon Oil Chevrolets driven by Stuart Kirby. They also appeared in one race on the  49 B.A.M. Dodge as a one race deal.    Just an opinion as always.|`|1hgYOv3Waa	jhon cenA  DIE  SEL  YOR CRACKED|`|2Bl7zOO4aa	Mike Garvey??|`|VQHGqYXvaa	trt?dg? Mykey  98  Got it !!!

Good Luck!!!|`|WV5cwIoTaa	depends if he get 500 hrs ot will get up to 400.00|`|oOVAbKPmaa	Not very much. Howard, being a current star in the majors, signs baseballs all the time making them quite plentiful. Now, if you had a Babe Ruth autographed baseball, then you'd have something...!|`|KVeenOGAaa	DO NOT SELL IT!!! I bet that thing will be worth 20 times that much in 10 years or less.|`|IPy8h0VVaa	To be honest, if it's an autograph you obtained yourself, then you're probably not going to get $50 out of it.  It's all about authenticity, and if you don't have a COA (Certificate of Authenticity), then serious collectors aren't going to be interested.  You can get a pretty good gauge on how much it is worth by simply checking eBay, however.  Take a look at how much Ryan Howard signed balls are going for on there.|`|e2xwOLFSaa	SAVE IT.  It will be so much more after his career is over.  If he continues at his rate for another 10 or so years, he could be a hall of famer.  If not a hall of famer, at least a very great ballplayer.  Trust me, save it and the value will rise|`|rD2vaZ70aa	if your talking about the baseball player then any were from $190.00-$250.00|`|dmci2TKBaa	Why on earth would you want to sell that?

fFnsJ7maaa	From their FAQ:     What will the children eat at camp?  "All meals are included in the camp fees. Hot breakfast entrees are complemented by a cold cereal, bagel, and fruit bar. Along with two lunch and dinner entrees are soup, salad, potato, or pasta bar, desert, and drinks. The outdoor grills allow campers to enjoy their choice of hamburgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs and chicken fajitas, during lunch and dinners."     It doesn't include snacks, but you can buy pizza, soda, ice cream, pretzels, chips, and candy at the store.|`|qE49jbVaaa	go steelers
xOReEw6Waa	Actually I almost bought a Howa 1500 stainless / laminate in 270 WSm for $400 at Sportsman's Warehouse. The Howa is the same as a Weatherby Vanguard which you can get at Wal Mart at around $300 most of the time for the blue / synthetic model. 308 is a good cartridge for both target and hunting, though I prefer 30-06, just because I grew up with them. The Howa is the base action for a lot of long range competitive rifles and again, it is the same as the Weatherby model. The Howa will do everything the Remington will do too, and the trigger feels better to me, unless you can get a new X trigger from Remington.   I also like the Tikka T3s because they are similar to my Browning A-Bolts;70% bolt, smooth as silk and with a Sako barrel and action.   The Tikka is normally $500.   The Nikon scopes are good, as are the Leupold scopes. You need to determine what type shooting you are doing most, target or hunting because a hunting scope isn't the same as the target models. 3x9 40mm to 6x16 50mm are standards for scope. Most hunting scopes don't need parallax adjustments because the ethical hunting range is around 350 yards for an average shooter. Some good links to check out below.     http://www.chuckhawks.com/rifle_hits_tab...  http://www.chuckhawks.com/gun_game.htm  http://www.chuckhawks.com/hunting_bullet...  http://fwp.mt.gov/FwpPaperApps/education...|`|gpON465Iaa	I have a French army rifle, great price, used, never fired, only dropped once.|`|Xa0ndGNjaa	If your just wanting to target shoot than get a 22. if you get a 308 your going to hate yourself when buying ammo.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I really like the cz bolt action rifles.  The trigger is a dual stage set.  It is quite simply the best trigger on a factory rifle.  I bought the 416 rigby in cz 550, and it will shoot 3/4" groups at 100 yards.  It has got a good, rock solid mauser action.  They are built like a bank vault.  As for scopes, you nailed it.  Get a 4.5-14 bdc buckmaster.  I've got one on my 338 win mag, and I have absolutely loved it.  http://www.cz-usa.com/products_bigbore_r...|`|6FlrGqnKaa	shooting and college? i say shooting is more important.     ill admit ive got a .308 and ammo prices are a bit high, but there is no fun is shooting a .22. The most fun comes from the recoil of the gun. So at least .223 or higher is good
0Dm3WEMcaa	It's fake... its a computer generated image... I kid    Wrestlemania is real they book an arena and it really happens.    The action is like all wrestling, scripted and done controlled way to put on a show. taking a slam on the mat is the same was being hit by a car going 20mph so it's not exactly fake is it? anyway you look at it that hurts so it can't be faked.|`|3074it1Qaa	well WM involves athletes from other sports and actors etc. so it would make since for it to be real and spontaneous. i think the WWE booking team uses the results of WM to work on storylines and gimmicks. besides if everything was planned it would get really boring.    P.S. WWE isn't fake it's scripted those things really do happen they just plan them|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	It's not fake it's scripted storylined entertainment|`|eJDRyYNaaa	The WWE in general is fake.     I might stop watching it because it's getting worse nowadays.  Last SmackDown Khali botched HHH's pedigree, couple weeks ago on RAW Shane McMahon landed some retarded punches on Randy Orton, etc.|`|6de74b356349ac2bf37fa75df2cfa356aa	It all is fake. It is another form of entertainment. Everything is pre-planned...how they are going to take falls, what they will say, etc. Even so, it is fun to watch grown men throw themselves around a small space, grunting and groaning. They must have too much testosterone.|`|sUmlxkQlaa	There really is an event called WrestleMaina which takes place.
Q2sZhNmJaa	Tony Stewart.  I like a little pudgy and Tony has that, in addition, I think he has a cute face, but like him when he has some stubble and that rough look.|`|AA11138176	neither total yuck on both can't even stand them gross dumb and dumber looking to me|`|88uIjItaaa	Well I'm a Guy so no Judging on my part.... but I gotta say when I see Amber Cope...

Not much, but he still has the edge.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Tony does for me every time.  scruffy..rough around the edges a bit...big brown eyes...        time for me to have a cigarette.....lol|`|iT8CNh6paa	im a guy so this isnt gay but Stewart does look better than Kyle|`|5LxpvXSmaa	Tony Stewart is a good looking man as long as he has a day or two of stubble on his face!|`|uouq4KCvaa	Tony Stewart|`|vIcOdePzaa	Out of the two I will have to say Tony Stewart.|`|Uaj4B84iaa	I'll be the minority here but I'm going with Kyle. He just seems fun to be around.|`|RLQdhFWXaa	Tony Stewart is such a cutie pie.  Reminds me of a Teddy Bear.  So Tony Stewart by far.|`|qxrr69bnaa	Tony's SMOKIN' HOT!|`|muc8sq9naa	Smoke, hands down!    *SHOQ*|`|oHrE5RT3aa	Redneck "Toddler" Kelly|`|dc7aface6d00f7d092ef793ad0219c26aa	Tony Stewart!

I don't mind a man with a little extra padding on him.|`|nZTwSA83aa	Oh my goodness..no question..Tony Stewart!|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	Oh my Tony Stewart by Far,Did you see the poll tonight?He looked Hot!!!

How could you say Tony is not attractive? He is VERY attractive and more than Kyle.     Kyle needs to stop cutting his hair, he looks much better.
Q2sZhNmJaa	My husband says he would not mind both; but he likes Danica better.|`|mTGEeCHaaa	Neither one of those ladies have NASCAR rides.  But they're both fairly pretty.  I guess.  They could both stand to eat a cheeseburger or 12.|`|iT8CNh6paa	Oh thats is not hard, Shawna NOT! Danica is way better looking than Shawna|`|mIdcJEJNaa	No contest, but you should have put Danica up against a contemporary like Dunia, or Sarah..  Poor Shawna is in her forties..|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	neither and all ladies but one (so far) answered your other one.|`|RLQdhFWXaa	I am a lady too and I am going to answer your ?     I pick Danica Patrick. Not because of her looks because I like her attitude.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Call me old fashioned....but back in her early days....Shawna was red hot and didn't have to flaunt it to get attention. She had curves and could handle the curves and turns in a race just fine.    Just an opinion as always.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	...or their "ride"|`|5LxpvXSmaa	Well in my opinion as a woman i would choose Danica but i did not care for her commercials during the Superbowl. She could have done better.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	Out of the two you have listed I say Danica Patrick. Ashley Force is Hotter in my opinion. :)|`|7RUMbREoaa	Danica is HAWT!!!!!!!!!|`|eTaK695Faa	I'll say Danica on looks alone. But there are other female racers out there that are hotter, look at Brittany and Courtney Force (Ashley too, but she was named already above). Of the three Force girls, it is hard to choose who is the hottest.|`|iEB1imSYaa	I think Danica is very pretty until she opens her mouth. She's a narcissistic brat in my opinion. Shawna doesn't possess the same physical beauty but is a much more attractive woman because of her spirit. Peace y'all|`|sQeyUGqLaa	danica no douht at all|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I answered your other question but I will answer this one too...I think Danica is just beautiful her attitude can suck but she is a pretty girl.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Well since you are asking then I'll say Danica but if Danica and Shawna were in front of me and they were asking then I would create some sort of competition by saying that they are both so beautiful that there needs to be more than just judging by outside beauty. I would tell them that they need to show me their inner beauty "LOL" and create a suck-up contest between the 2 of them. I would definitely try to milk the situation for everything I could ... Sometimes I have trouble hiding my horns ...!!! Most of the time I try to be a good guy though :)|`|vj6YpJn8aa	Danica...and I liked her Superbowl commercials.|`|2Bl7zOO4aa	Milka Duno  I saw her walking last year in Miami and WOW. She was wearing a really short skirt. Her butt is pretty big too.|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Yeah!    I'll take Ashley Force! You can keep both of them.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	Danica Patrick  Big time hotter !!!!!

8qtm4qkUaa	I doubt someone with myopia could ever become  1 in the world, as I believe that such a physical deficiency also would show up in a slightly weaker hand-eye co-ordination, especially if there's astygmatism as well. (I've got both - my mypoia is so severe it can't be corrected by laser and I'd always have to wear glasses or contacts.)    But for ordinary players, socially and even in grade competition, it doesn't affect your game significantly enough as long as you have the right specs or contacts.    (Myopia is short-sightedness for those who don't know what we're talking about.)|`|9hC7bbf7aa	As long as you wear a pair of correct contact lenses if you have myopia in both eyes, it should not affect playing tennis.     Astigmatism could affect tennis, I too have had myopia previously, and did not hinder my playing ability, but astigmatism had affected more, because I had a difficulty seeing lines correctly. Now a days myopia, astigmatism can be easily and successfully corrected by Lasix surgery.

HkwUGOmxaa	161 will be lighter and easier to turn for the trees and park. The 166 is better for stability, speed, deap snow but wont spin as easy off of the jumps. So where do you live? If you want to ride more park go shorter...you are young too. If you are going to get heavier and dont want to buy anew board for awhile then stay with what you got. If I had to pick one now I would say the 161. I ride a 162 and I am 210 6'2". I am 37, been riding 16 years. and I llive in Colorado. The lenghth is good for all...but it would be nice to have the 166 on really deap days.

EDIT: Near misses  On March 3, 1990, Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets was credited with 29 points, 18 rebounds, 10 assists, and 11 blocks in a game against Golden State.[5] The NBA does not recognize this as a quadruple-double in his biography,[6] although he is credited with 10 assists in his career stats. The initial game report credited Olajuwon with only 9 assists. Later review of the game by the team led to him being awarded a tenth assist; however, the NBA did not allow the late change and refused to recognize the feat as a quadruple-double.

FYd1ndVxaa	I don't want to bother myself to say everything in details as I have done it with effort, seeing also that this question has been asked more than 10 times in a year. In short, Federer is a better overall tennis player, despite Nadal overwhelms Federer time and again. Look for more by typing the question in the 'Search for questions' search engine appearing at the top of the Yahoo!Answers page.  So many great answers here! Equally, even more great answers answered in the past.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	federer has a more complete game, but nadal is playing better than federer now.|`|8qtm4qkUaa	How many times is this same question going to get asked, I wonder? It's turned up at least a few dozen times on Answers already!    Right now, Nadal is the better player. He's won their recent encounters on a variety of surfaces. He's also won more tournaments other than the ones where he's played Fed in the finals and that's why he'd have kept his  1 ranking even if Federer had won the Aussie Open.    In Melbourne last week, Nadal's serve was better than Federer's, his forehand was better and also the topspin he put on it caused Federer a lot of trouble on the backhand. Federer doesn't have one weapon that really damages Nadal at the moment. He should have - it should be his serve. But he served hopelessly in the final this week, which by his own admission cost him the match.    Federer's career still would rank him above Nadal in any "all time" list, but Nadal is catching up quickly. Federer is good enough to overcome his difficulties with Nadal - a good coach would help.     Federer is much better to watch, in my view. He has more variety to his game; his serve is more attractive to watch and he comes to the net more often than Nadal. Nadal covers the court like crazy, but his game relies a lot more on swinging his ad court serve out wide to the right hander and on that topspin forehand. It's a great, exciting game to watch, but I still prefer Federer.|`|2236ceecfd3a3407e11a4bab14969c07aa	At this moment, Rafael Nadal is the best!    But, remember that Federer has won 3 grand slams in the same year for 3 times (2004, 2006, 2007) and 2 grand slam in 2005.    Compared to Nadal, he just won 2 grand slams in last year. If he want to be greater than Federer, then he has to won 4 grand slams this year!  Otherwise, the greatest player is still Roger Federer.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	to me, both federer and nadal are already "legends" of the sport because of all that they have been able to achieve so far.    federer  - 5 consecutive wimbledons 2003-2007  - won 3 of the 4 grand slams in 2004, 2006, 2007  - 5 consecutive us opens 2004-2008  - ranked no.1 for 237 consecutive weeks  - 65 consecutive matches won on grass  - won 4 tennis masters cups  - 13 grand slams (and counting...)  - 19 consecutive grand slam SF (and counting...)  - 10 consecutive grand slam finals [wimbledon 2005-us open 2007]    nadal  - 4 consecutive french opens 2005-2008  - won french open, queen's club, wimbledon, olympic gold in 2008  - won grand slams on all 3 different surfaces- clay, grass and HC  - 81 consecutive matches won on clay  - finally no.1 after a record 160 weeks spent at no.2  - 6 grand slams (and counting...)  - 5 consecutive grand slam SF (and counting...)    i think at the moment, nadal is definitely the better player, BUT, that will all change as soon as roger hires a coach to help him overcome the mental block he seems to be having whenever he plays against the young Spaniard. nadal also has roger's number in H2H- 13-6.    take away all the clay court matches, and federer is barely ahead 5-4.    but, i still think overall, federer is the better player in terms of technique, federer is a more complete player than nadal, he makes it all look so smooth and fluid when he is on the court, and the variety fed possesses is incredible.    nadal is a great player to watch with the way he covers the court, but i feel that whenever he runs, he is digging his shoes into the court, whilst federer just exhibits such smooth movement, roger glides across the court. federer's game is definitely much easier on the eyes than rafa's game.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Technically speaking, Fed is still superior - to Rafa or anyone else. The Spaniard *is* still making efforts to improve, though, and today he's far from the clay court-only player he used to be until not so long ago.|`|pddwVjALaa	Well... Considering they are my FAVOURITE sports stars in the world, i have to tell you their positivities first before my decision...    NADAL:   Professional, Athletic, determined, strong, excellent player   and not to mention... cute     FEDERER:   Smart, Polite, Good technique, Great player, excellent team mate.     I would personally have to say Nadal, considering he has won lately more,  has more positivities to do with his playing and  is younger which means more energy.|`|iyDXt5d9aa	Rafa works so hard and fights for every win against Federer. I think Rafa's the better player. Vamos! =)|`|1mKJFfieaa	Hmm that is a good question...I personally prefer Federer but Overall I think that Nadal B/c Nadal is younger than Federer and he has the potential to Break all the records that Previous tennis player has set...So I'll say Nadal but Federer will always be a legend!!!    =)|`|cTcX7vumaa	federer..although i like nadal better|`|utKtg5Tsaa	federer, they are both excellent players but i think that nadal wont hold first place nearly as long as federer did.|`|DEDmq2OWaa	If your mark is the   of slams, then right now you give it to Fed- If it's about all surfaces, then it's Rafa- Clay still eludes Fed- thanks to Rafa-time will tell!|`|sptrtwxlaa	Rafa is better|`|DubchQ6Waa	i think that Federer is historical better, but in this moment Nadal is dominating|`|UsJDUm1Haa	they are both really good. but i like federer|`|zuokne16aa	Federer, by far  I was saddened by his defeat at the Aussie open =(|`|IQpGAJERaa	right now nadal obviously is better. federer is the better overall player and will be known as the greatest of all time. wait for the next wimbledon where federer will get revenge and re-take  1 rank|`|fqcfL2sFaa	I lik ur question.hope u like my answer,2.

But lets face it, Rafa has added a few tricks to his repetoire in the last year, and if he keeps doing that then it's not going to be long before we all turn the tables.    Watching the AO final, you can't help but think of the energiser bunny when you watch Rafa.  He just keeps on keeping on.    And all that comes from a diehard Federer tragic!

JSeQRSgWaa	honestly dude i think you should go for a whole new setup and not buy anything 4 years old. chances are if theyre 4 years old then that company has come up with a LOT of improvements over the years in their boots/boards so you'll probably be happier if you just treat yourself to totally new gear. as for boots, if you have wide feet like me, don't buy burtons. they run narrow for the most part. nitro, rome's, dc's, 32's, and k2's are AWESOME. nitros are wideeeeeee like a motha so theyre definitely very comfy for a wide foot. as for arch support even if you don't have flat feet, DEFINITELY look into buying some custom arches or just different arches than the boots come with. the insteps that boots come with are absolutely horrendous and totally uncomfortable most of the time. you'll know that your boot fits when your toes are lightly touching the front of your boots and when your heel isn't popping up. basically, a good fit is when the boot is snug and touching every part of your foot but not too tight to cut off circulation.      as for a board, i like romes because it's a smaller company than something big such as burton. Rome puts a lot of effort into their products and i have a rome vinyl 2007 and i have NO complaints. K2's are pretty good, but GNU is also an outstanding brand.      good luck!! email me with any questions:)|`|BHmqNrs9aa	IF U BUY FROM HIM UR STUPID BY NEW STUFF|`|aJp3BbWcaa	Ahm.. 100 or 150..

HkwUGOmxaa	a few suggestions. I worked in the snowboard industry for 8 years and been riding for 16...if you stretch a boot it will only be temporary. Are you wearing more than one pair of socks? You should only wear one. This will allow the blood to flow more freely. If your feet are still clod then wear warmer layers under your pants and add a vest under your coat. If you put footbeds in your boots they will keep your feet from sliding forward into the boot. It will give you more arch support too. remember to take out the old ones. Super feet costs 20 bucks but they last forever. Mine are a bit more than that as they are custom molded to my feet. Burton boots run a bit smaller than other boots I have found. I am an 11 in Burton and 32 but a 10.5 in ride and D.C. You may also bring in your board to have it looked at by a professional. Sometimes you get a lot of heal movement in the boot so you crank down on your bindings and then your feet fall asleep. You can adjust your straps. The footbeds will also reduce some of the heal movement. If these things do not work then sell your boots to a friend and move onto something new. It happens sometimes. Try on your boot and strap in in the shop. Hang out for awhile and see if your feet feel good before buying them. I hope something in here will help you.|`|XJWeuLPoaa	dont stretch out your boots! you want them stiff lol   they are probably to small for you! you always want them a half size bigger then you normally wear

q4YGEjS4aa	I like Rock Storms answer.   And as a pitcher that gained ten mph's on his fastball from high school to college the weightlifting did little to help.    Most of the best workouts your going to get aren't from high weight low reps.  Low weights for many more reps will help you throw harder and with much better endurance.    All year round we did cardio, and core work.  Tons of core work.  Also tons of stretching.  We only lifted weights in the winter between fall and spring ball.   And on all the work out programs and forms we had for the pitching staff, never once did it say to work on our maxes.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Well this isn't really the place to ask this question, you don't get truthful answers here. All the "college and high school" pitchers here make up numbers in pathetic attempts to impress people they will never know or see. I've never seen anything like it. You'd be better to ask other players you compete against in person, not a group of kids who make up figures.
OO6K7McVaa	It usually depends if ur a good athletic it took me 2 weeks but they said that   i learned quick now im on level 5 tumbling but i would say a month or two check out my source|`|6fUX5Qtjaa	it depends on your armstrength and if your are afraid to do it and stuff like that it also depends on how good your technique is .. it took me a long time to learn my bhs like a month or so but it took me like 2 weeks to get a standing tuck so it all just depnds n your ability and technique and strength|`|w9cRY2MVaa	ive been tumbling since i was 2, and i got my backhandspring at 3. im pretty sure anyone can flip if they concentrated. at my gym my teachers were from china so they had special techniques of teaching you to do something in a couple of days.  work on your back walkover, but land it with both feet in a snap down.  practicing this, and jumping back, garantees that you will have a backhandspring in probably a week or so from now.  it really doesnt matter how long you have been cheering, but how long you have been training this skill.  1 and a half hours of just tumbling should be enough time to learn in a week.  i train 4 days a week for 3 hours, but when i was little i trained for an hour, and i got my backhandspring quickly, and in the next year with the same trainer, i learned my tuck,front and back. arials front, side, and holding my foot. walkovers turning, front, and back, and side summies.  i learned a layout stepout at 6, and at 7 i was connecting skills (eg tuck handspring layouts) when i turned 9 i got my full, and by the end of the year i had a standing full. im 12 now, and im working on doubles standing, and running fronts.  it matters on how dedicated you are, and how good your teacher is truthfully haha. but, like i probably have said before , practice will be the only factor in the end

NOEJMDfiaa	The best way is to get off of Yahoo! and practice. Practice practice practice. I don't mean to be rude, but this question is seriously the dumbest question and probably the most asked one. Obviously, working out doesn't hurt. Practicing something is the best way to get good at it. No one on here can help you. You have to help yourself by getting off of the computer and getting active. Once again I apologize if this sounds rude.|`|TK1O6RLHaa	Get a Private Instructer. Do this because you probably lost all your mechanics so the insructer can help you get the mechanics. Go to the batting cage. Basically do anything that revolves around baseball except Watching it on t.v or playing video games. Go to the gym and use proper weight material. Using the proper weight material you will be able to get your power from the legs, arm and body. Work on your balance is also one thing. Baseball revolves around balance. So your Summer to do list should look like this    1. Hire an Instructer  2. Batting cage  3. Go to a gym and use proper weight material  4. Work on Balance  5. Stop watching T.V., Playing Video Games, and get off the computer  6. Drink Calcium and eat Protien use Vitamins  Remember to do limited practice or you will break a bone or be sore and won't be able to play.   NEVER USE STERIODS

wgWbm2zUaa	A group of my friends just started a couple of years ago and we are all around your age.  They are rapidly becoming excellent players.  Of course, practice and lessons will help a lot but actually getting out on the course to play is priceless.  We all have improved our game because we get out and play a couple times a week.  Sometimes when all you do is practice, you lose your ability to focus but by playing a couple rounds a week will really help you become target oriented.      If you have carpeting in your house, practice putting.  This is where the majority of your score comes from so it is important.    It sounds like you have a good support system to learn golf from your friends.  Many people get stressed out when they first start going to the course to play and become discouraged.  One of the best ways to play on the course without this happening is to play Better Ball with your friends.  Once everyone has hit a ball, you take the best playing position in the fairway and all hit from this location.  This will allow you to play at a normal pace without having any stress from making bad shots.  That way you can get real life practice in and have fun doing it!|`|WOBAN2iqaa	Its the best sport ever invented and never ever too late to start. I definately recommend you get out there now!|`|yA9Grz9Maa	No it's not to late and with good instruction and practice you can get pretty good pretty quick.

When I first started, my handicap was a 38 now (only 18 months later) it is 23. Becoming as good as a pro would be a joke at my age. But getting my score to a certain level and beating my friends once in a while is all I need. Maybe that is all you would need, too. Not every good golfer started when they were in diapers. If you just going to play for fun you don't have to be great at it, you just have to enjoy it and have fun.|`|sKTaniriaa	No, it's never too late. However, if you find you enjoy it, I'd recommend taking a lesson or two. I'm (painfully) self taught and though I love the game I know now that I could have skipped some of the bumps in the road. Good luck.|`|Wa7wktLkaa	people take up the game after retiring often so 32 is early, just dont have any hopes of becoming a touring pro because it is 99.999999% impossible.|`|4b3332df8190c2f3c7712f9c840cba13aa	Unless you want to go professional, it's never too late to start golfing. There are plenty of people that golf in their 90's.. so 32 is certainly not to late to start. I would advise you to get some lessons to make it easier to understand the swing. It may take quite some time before you become good, but just being out there hacking the ball around is fun as well.|`|1onXs5gPaa	It is never too late, really.|`|AA11029380	Never too late.  I took it up at 55 and LOVE it.  I'll never be nearly as good as any pro but I can't wait to get to the course for a round.|`|l3MC9sxgaa	32 is not too old, no question about it  you can swing a golf club, and your body can definately take up any extra strain that may come from bad technique when you first start out    if your friends invited you to play, your probably not an idiot, so get a instructor or a friend who is good at golf and after a month of practicing maybe 2-3 hours a week at the range and practice swinging a golf club at home you should have the basics down    thats just an estimate, some people take longer, but i guarentee that if you actually wanna learn to play golf, and get a few lessons, within 6 months youll feel comfortable enough to get out on the course and enjoy yourself a bit (even though the first round may get you really angry when you find yourself making mistakes)    you still got a lot of years to go before you kick the bucket, learning golf should be worthwhile for you|`|bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	It is not to late.  I started 2 years ago at 34 and am completely hooked.  Take some lessons, play some rounds, have fun!|`|kT4I3C6caa	Never too old to start. I know someone who started golfing at 71 years old and he is a happy golfer now!  There are so many angles to the game that enable you to play even with different skill levels of players.|`|m3L6pLBaaa	never to late. to start i just started i played in high school probably 5 rounds. i am 31 i will be 32 at the end of the month i just started. Since everyone i play aginst has been playing for sometime i ususally have fun and try to beat them on a few holes. right now i play against myself to try to better my score each round. I really suck bad but i have problems driving. then if i make it to the whole in a few shots i have problems with my apporoch. i droped on stoke last week which still sucks i shot a 57 in a par 33. yeah but it is nice to get out of the house and spend time with my friends.

(this should give you optimum physical performance!)  its normal to be nearvous at the start of any sport (when competing!) i always am! i thnk it makes me play better anyways !  about 5mins into the game im too concerened about whats happenign in the game to worry about being nearvous!  at the end of teh day its just a game so chill!    you can try streatching and warming up before the game that might take your mind off things and help you relax...
HkwUGOmxaa	careful...this is a very good company but you need to try on several brands to see what brand and style best fits you. It is the most important thing in riding. A lot of people will tell you what the best is and what works for them. The salomon is great for some. I like 32 but they seem a bit wide. I like d.c. but they are softer and sometimes I replace them a bit more often then I like to but there is no break in time and they feel great out of the box. Burton makes a good boot because the company has a ton of cash and can do a lot of on mountain riding research. But it comes down to what feels like it was made for your foot and not boxy or like rental. What fits like a glove, is easy to get on and off, and has good heal hold. When trying them on spend some time wearing them in the store....standing, flexing your knees...and ask the sales guy why they are the best. He should say because it seems to fit you the best....not...because its what I wear or they are just the best. Burton sells more and that has a lot to do with marketing. 32 sells a lot but all they make is boots so they focus on one product and do it well. I have been riding for 16 years and worked in the snowboard industry for 8 years. I ride RIDE boots. My wife has 32 but she is switching to rides next year. This company has really come up with some new things and great fits over the last couple of years. Just remember...listen to evryones opinions but remember its just that.|`|mGlpv6SXaa	well everyone had different feet and preferences and sensabilities etc. i tried on some 32 ultralights but thought they didnt have the comfort i need out of a boot, in my opinion. but try going to a shop, real snowboard shop and talk to the employees cuz they will have a conversation with u and have actually ridden the boots they sell and can give feedback on the boots based on what u tell them. also u can try em on and see what u think of the different brands fit, (i could not find a size of 32s that fit me this year) so i say try that.     also, i love my nikes, despite that people have to hate on the brand not quality|`|7otyLHwCaa	Check out the 32 Lashed, super comfortable dude, and its not too soft and not too stiff. great boot.

2ece24deba6e7760d2c205b331e95863aa	A silencer for any air rifle just consists of a tube with baffles in it, like a straight pass car muffler.  A bottle with metal or other mesh inside of it will also work, but ruins accuracy.  You can use plastic instead of aluminum or steel like you would for a real firearm.  A Red Ryder BB gun makes more action noise than muzzle noise, so a silencer would only change the looks, not the noise level.  Take a look at http://www.subguns.com and http://www.silencertalk.com for advice, drawings and ATF forms.    If you live in the USA, then there are also a few legal issues you need to know about.  While the ATF routinely approves the transfer to or making of silencers by unlicensed civilians, there is a $200 tax paid for each to register them.  Also only 37 states allow unlicensed civilians to own them.  Even air rifle silencers are controlled as real silencers even if they only work for one shot.  The only way to make or buy an air rifle silencer in the USA without paying a tax is to make it integral to the barrel and in such a manner that removing it would destroy it.     In other words, if you live in the USA, it is a waste of time to make a silencer for a Red Ryder.  Hopes this helps.    Ranb|`|QrjuueMCaa	Dude, would you let the Big-Boys have their space!?

sptrtwxlaa	because you already have a second ball ready for the second serve-why play with an extra ball in your skirt if you don't have to? Now if the serve was a let I pick it back up.  also, it's easier to throw it away bc picking it up looks dumb and is out of my ritual.  No one has to, it's just a habit by most players.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	there's no reason really. when someone returns a ball back to me after a fault, i'll usually use it unless i already have a ball in my hand.|`|8qtm4qkUaa	Their strings are a lot tighter than the ones that us mere mortals hit with, and they hit with so much top spin or slice, that the balls wear out pretty quickly. That's why they change them every 9 games.    So the balls don't get hit that often during the course of the 9 games, and the players want to keep them all similar and hit the fluffiest ones. (Their slice, spin, etc works better on fluffy, newer balls.)    So, they're evening out the wear and tear on the balls. One that's just been hit is going to be a little flatter than one that hasn't just been hit.      If someone hitting in their local competition on a Saturday does this, they are just a wanker. But when a pro does it, it's because they play the game at a different level. That's why they are pros after all.|`|FNvv74UQaa	They blame the ball's imperfections for their screw up.. or at least they want to be sure it isn't the ball that caused the fault.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	They don't HAVE to use another ball, they choose to use another ball.

If the ball caused the fault, they don't want it  to happen again.|`|NR5LhOpPaa	You don't have to use a different ball.  It's just a strange thing we do.  I mean, clearly it's the ball's fault that we double fault, not our own.    Though you do occasionally see players use the same one.  Usually either means they are frustrated or purely indifferent.|`|NDbx9CSvaa	They don't have to use it. They already have another ball in their pocket so it does not make sense to serve your second serve with a ball in your pocket. Women who don't keep an extra ball in their spandex shorts or ball holder might use that ball from the fault originally. Almost all men keep a second ball in their pocket so they will throw it away if it came back to them.    However if they serve and it's a let and the opponent hits it back to them, then they might use that ball since they still have another go at the serve.|`|DEDmq2OWaa	Mental= I think they do that to focus themselves- it gives that little extra few seconds.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	There is no rule suggesting players must use different balls for first and second serve. It's just superstitious act of the players. Some of they think that if the ball 'wouldn't allow' him to successfully make the first serve, than it just wouldn't in the next; some many other thoughts are there in players' mind too, just to name one example. The ball boys just wouldn't want to bother themselves to get a new ball and give it to the player. Even if there are ball boys who  do it, it would waste time.. It's their mental..
oxL961P9aa	If you have a weak left foot, the only way to make that stronger is to practice shooting, passing and dribbling with the left, practice fresh air kicks first so that the left foot is used to it when you are about to strike the ball....|`|dqy7DdoSaa	Practice with your left foot get a ball out set up a few cones as a target and begin with passes on the ground at a short distance.    As you get more confident move back further but still pass it along the ground.    If you are already past this stage make the angles more difficult and practice aerial kicks and try to get it through the cones.    That would help you strengthen it up but it takes practice one stage at a time that will be the only way to improve it.|`|35xHBXPcaa	practice... the only way|`|NaINXGLNaa	roll ur foot over the ball a few times to get ur foot familiar with the ball, the practice kicking the ball against a wall with ur left until u get a better feel for it...also passing using only ur left foot with a friend would help to...hope that helps...peace
xhPKkkELaa	Bob,    I hope you have fun, but first off all, you will wait long and hard for a few VERY cold days of mediocre surfing in the Great Lakes. Second, if you are you already a pretty fair surfer, you might be able to make the most of it, but you sound like a newbie to me (read some of the resolved questions on this site, you'll get a lot of good info). However, if that is what you want to do, who am I to stand in your way.     But, you did ask a question, and I am going to give you a VERY HONEST answer. Somebody already gave you good advice. Don't buy a surfboard on line. Go to a good surf shop. Talk to the folks there about your skill level (and be honest) and take there guidance in what you buy. Additionally, the only way you can get any surfboard for $250.00 is a used surfboard. You just don't know enough about surfing to buy a used board on-line without getting ripped off.    Get somebody to drive you down I80 to I476 and take I276 east. Take the Jersey Turnpike to either north Jersey of south Jersey resort towns, and that is where you A) Buy surfboards and B) actually surf.    Check  out the links, and good luck (PS I worked from the time I was 11 - doesn't it still snow in Binghamton? And don't people need their walks shoveled?)    Be very careful of what you read here on line. Some of the folks who answer on this site are very nice young folks, but not really very experienced surfers. In fact some of the folks who are giving you advice may not know as much about surfing as you do. After I found this site, I figured that I could answer a few questions, and spread the 'good news' of surfing. I think that after 42 years, I may have picked up a good idea or two.    Good luck, and remember surfing is really worth it. take the time to learn about the ocean and be at home in it, and you will have fun for life.  http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm  Boards made in far eastern sweatshops:http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...  http://www.explainthatstuff.com/surfings...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXprcyUoU...|`|78GAeOeuaa	hey bob. you really should buy your board in person. never buy a board online. it is a really stupid idea. the shipping might acctually damage the board too. just go to your local surf shop and pick out the perfect board that you will love for ever. please dont order online. you will probably regret it if you do.|`|piC6bG1baa	Pick the Al Merrick. Im sure it is available on your local surf shop.

1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Wow; the anti's are out in force tonight.      The other guy got it right; aim for the heart and not the head.      This is from http://www.bowhunting.net/wildturkey.net...    "A straight-on shot through the chest of a turkey can be a high percentage shot. However, aiming for this spot does risk the chance of severing the beard from the turkeys chest.     If the turkey is broadside, aim for the base of the turkeys wing. This shot will pin the turkeys wing to its body, making it nearly impossible to fly away. A shot in this area will also penetrate the vitals area for a quick and clean kill.     A turkey in full strut and facing directly away from a bowhunter still offers a presentable shot. An arrow placed up the backside of a turkey will either severe the spine or pass through the mid-section of the turkeys body. With this shot, the broadhead is sure to slice through main organs, quickly making the bird immobile."    [Oh, and Christine S commented that   "My goodness, you must be so cleaver to stalk a turkey."    She brings up a good point.  A cleaver might be a little big but yes; you should bring your skinning knife.]|`|gpON465Iaa	use the arrow instead of the bow, aim for the heart|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	Aim for the heart of chest cavity.  They make broadheads called the Gobbler Guillotine that is meant to be fired at the head essentially decapitating it.      If I've asked it once I've asked it a million times, if you're anti-hunting what are you doing on a hunting message board?  Go to hell liberal anti's.  Oh and the girl that sarcastically said how clever you have to be to stalk a turkey, you've definitely proven your ignorance.   1 you never stalk a turkey, people who stalk turkeys often wind up stalking other turkey hunters by mistake causing accidents.   2 A turkey is very difficult to hunt.  They have amazing hearing and even better eyesight.  They say if a turkey could smell you'd never kill one.      And in case I forgot to tell you anti's, suck a fat one!|`|DHIudHy2aa	With a normal broadhead, you will want to aim for the heart, and MAYBE the neck if you know you can make that shot. If you are going to buy one of those ridiculous 4" guillotine heads, then you are supposed to aim for the neck. I wouldn't advise using those though, they seem to big and ungainly to work.    PS. Christine, "cleaver" is a type of knife, "clever" is the word you were looking for. Don't be embarrassed though, we don't expect much more from your kind.|`|cZQXsSFmaa	The broad head is called a gobbler guillotine.It has a wide diameter meant for head shots. But for fixed blades right below the woddles or if he is side ways just right of where the wind is attached... good luck|`|QrjuueMCaa	Unless you get a "guillotine" broadhead, aim for the body where the wing meets the body. Simple as that. Remember that your concealment is pinnacle due to the movement of drawing a bow. Good luck! Shoot straight!|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i would use a broadhead that is large in diameter, and i agree with the rest, aim for the heart with a bow, good luck|`|nooi0ldjaa	they have arrow heads meant just for large birds, not sure of the name or where to find them...    you arm for their heart, don't try to take a head shot like with a shotgun.

It's best learned on the field through practice and games.    As to your second question, 13 is perfectly fine to be starting.  I didn't start to play until I was in high school.  I still play 11 years later.  I also coach high school and ref.  I've coached kids who started in high school who have gone on to play in college.  I've also seen kinds struggle with the game as well.  It really depends on the kid.    However, if you really enjoy playing and are willing to work hard in practice to get better, then you should do fine.  Lacrosse is a really fun sport.|`|qD6h8GVyaa	First you grab the balls and give them a good feel down to make sure it's smooth and not rough, it's hard to play with rough balls.  Then you have to figure out who's going to be the pitcher and the catcher who's going to take it from behind them.  Once the balls are thrown you run down the field and try to catch it and go to home base.
1gHVlfbNaa	They have to play harder so the defense won't concentrate on Kobe. They cannot rely on Kobe for the bulk of their offense especially now that Bynum is out.

WrDGhduxaa	To improve your spring you should be doing plyometrics, not just lifts.  It takes explosive muscular action, which may  not be improved from lifting alone.  Comparisons between different people only shows their different talents or abilities it does not reflect the amount of training.  Skill or genes plays a bigger role in performance than your hard work.

AA11914978	Yes it is 100% waterproof material. However, its how you join it together at the seams which can let water in. If you need to join sections together make sure the edges are cut straight and are clean. Use a good Neoprene cement like 'Black Witch' and apply to both edges. When it becomes tacky push the edges together and hold in place for  3-4 minutes and let the seam cure for at least an hour before putting any stress on it. If you have any design questions you can drop me a message through my YouTube channel; Berkcam    Good luck!
pUkFH8D0aa	run so lift weights and go on a treadmill riding bikes are fun and eat healthy not JUST cutting back|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	You could weight 240 pounds and have it all of mostles and strenghs and not fat try to make that work instead of losing all the weight!|`|FUBghKjMaa	I would still walk a few miles that is good. I would suggest mix it with Jogging. Jog a little and walk a little mix it up. It will build stamina. I would start doing push ups maybe twenty or thirty every other day. The next day do sit ups. Both exercises will help build upper body strength and make your abdomins stronger. I would suggest stretching alot to relax your muscles before exercising and after exercising. I would suggest drinking alot of water. Try to maybe eat salads & fruits. Use Less salt on your meals. Just a suggestion. Also I would suggest lifting weights. Try to do some curls in both hands. I would suggest using weights to make your upper body stronger. I would even suggest maybe using a tread mill too. Hope all this information might help some.|`|tACz8JjAaa	well for starts lift weights, and run, walking wont be getting you anywhere. If you are strict on that over the summer you can drop 20lbs.|`|H5EYUh69aa	There is NO time like the present dude ... Stricter in the summer ?    Why not now ? ... Man, Just get your *** running, swimming, kicking *** at the gym, eating right, preparing yourself mentally and physically.    It would take all day to describe to you what to do and how to do it,  Just be your own motivation and work to the highest standard,  It will take a few weeks to get in better shape.    Just, make sure that you STICK to your regime during the summer INSTEAD OF starting a regime in the summer.    Just think ahead for after your workout ... The hardest part is the mental aspect ... If you don't look forward to a workout then your not going to succeed in that workout and you will be mentally exhausted before your physically exhausted so mental preperation is vital.    Then, once you sort that out and go down hard on yourself to get in shape NOW and not LATER ... You'll be kicking your own *** day in and day out.     Good luck man|`|8DMDTogvaa	You can walk all you want, it won't help. You need to be able to run at least a whole mile without stopping. Make sure you are conditioned or else it might be tough. Stick wtih it.
ZW8OFvCDaa	If your good enough, get involved with the governing body - The LTA. (Lawn tennis association)    Join one of their clubs, they have many throughout the UK. After joining, youll soon know from their feedback whether your good enough to make it. Tennis is one of the hardest sports to become professional in though as the competition is so high (You wouldnt think it based on the players britain has produced in the last decades eh?.........Andy Murray aside of course :-)    Their website is below though so go on, join, check it out and see where your nearest club is.     Good luck and even if you dont make it, enjoy the game anyway :-)|`|8qtm4qkUaa	Sorry, got to agree with Paul W.     Not many of the top players these days didn't do well as 15 and 16 year olds in the Junior Grand Slam tournaments, so if you're 19 already and not playing competitively it's too late to become a professional.    I'd ask, who said you were good at tennis? If you're not playing for a club against good competition every week and winning, then how do they know? Being good at sport is a relative thing. I'm good at it when I play against others of my standard and win a share of matches, but then I stop playing other 50 year olds and play my son and it's a different thing altogether!    Sorry to deflate you, but suggest you don't worry about becoming a pro. Just get into a team and play competitively if you love it that much, and see where you end up.|`|pddwVjALaa	Well...   1.   You join a few clubs.  2.   Get to professional level  3. Ask your trainer about your dream and he or she will push you to become a pro.   4.   Apply for national competitions  5.  Be recognised around the world  6  WIN WIMBLEDON!|`|4plmaU3Naa	for about the 10 000th time...    1) register wuth state/province/ local governing body  2) compete is local/state tourneys  3) compete is national tourneys  4) get an ipin from itftennis.com  5) enter ITF tourneys in your area  6) travel to higher tourneys  7) enter WTA tournies  8) become a WTA member, entitled to heath insurance etc.     warning: ya, i may lose 10 pts for saying this but: if you dont know how to do this by age 19 ur chances are rather slim. just try and play college tennis LOL|`|010REAj7aa	Start by looking for a good club to join thats close to home for you. A club with decent facilities, good size membership so that you can play against different players/skills, different court surfaces - some clubs have both grass & hardcourt or indoor/outdoor for example - & a club tennis coach.      Next step would be to look @ playing in some Local / Regional tennis tournaments. This will give you an idea as to where to you stand @ that moment compared to other top players in your region, will show you where you need to improve your game and will tell you if you really want or have what it takes to become a pro at this sport. At this step, it would pay to have a coach with you - some clubs coaches may go along with club members if the coach thinks that player has potential, just ask coach - to look at your game while you play, taking notes on areas to improve your game while givivg you advice & support. Do well @ this stage & the doors will slowly open....National Touneys / ITF / WTA. There will be people in place to guide you to the next step.    Look to improve your technique/s - Serves, Forehands/Backhands etc  Develop some strategies - Serve & Volleys, Working towards the net etc  A good fitness schedule to help you keep up with the demands of this sport and last but not least.....Keep enjoyin it.    Good Luck from the KoolKat

SpiEasx5aa	When I used to shoot "reloaded" shells, sometimes they were not resized properly and would stick.   I shoot a Remington 1100.  I just got a piece of wood (small 2 x 4) and tapped action back till the shell eventually came out. If you dont want to do that call a local shooting range and ask if you can come shoot 1 shell on their skeet range, or drive out to the country and shoot it out.  You may have a plastic residue build-up in the chamber of the barrel so when you do get the shell out clean your gun good and scrub that area with a bore brush and solvent.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	I've not used an 11-48.  My Remington 11-87 has a handle on the bolt that you pull towards the rear of the gun.  It moves in a slot and unlocks the bolt from the barrel.      If you want, you can order an owner's manual here:  http://www.remington.com/literature_requ...    (You will have to register with their site which is free)|`|DHIudHy2aa	I am not familiar with that exact gun, but I would say just pull back on the bolt handle, like you are loading the first shell, and it will eject.
PauZf6ixaa	You could but you'd run into two problems.  One, you'll probably end up breaking something trying to take it apart unless it's a very high quality springer, which i doubt. And if you managed to disassemble it safely any sort of powerful spring is going to quickly wear down the plastic internals and break them within a few hundred rounds.  And second the spring is going to cost more than the gun itself.  If you're looking for a more powerful spring pistol I'd just shop around for a new one. I'd suggest going to Airsoft Atlanta http://www.airsoftatlanta.com/spring.htm and picking up one of the metal series pistols or the KWC Berreta 92FS if you want a nice springer pistol.|`|xMSESsGQaa	Ya u can put better springs in. But the upgrade would cost more then the gun

3s59vsLNaa	I think it should be because it seems to give someone an extension of some sort of a dribble, like under-handing it to the backboard (an under-hand to over-hand is a turnover while dribbling) or a push pass to oneself is a travel in other cases of basketball (or it would be), but I guess, apparently, it is not for a dunk:    Section XIV-Traveling  j. A player who attempts a field goal may not be the first to touch the ball if it fails to touch the backboard, rim or another player.    That's from the NBA website.  I think it is more like a travel but it's not clear (who am I to say); though if there is a clear path to the rim, if it is, it shouldn't be (more power to a guy for making an easy two points difficult).  Anyway, offensive razzle-dazzle runs the NBA, so it will not be a turnover.|`|kA237kT8aa	no|`|25dae56825b91363788a0a201af05595aa	No, but bouncing it on the ground to yourself and then dunking it is a turnover|`|Fs7rCHO9aa	It's not a turnover if you pass it to yourself off of the backboard and dunk it. It's a self-pass assist.

Hw4qQLNOaa	The Rock is not coming back (relax i'm not insulting the rock he just doesn't wanna go to the wwe) and if he did come back at mania he wouldn't face MVP. Common this is mania the grandest stage of them all.   Also who is in the ECW gauntlet that I doubt will happen?  Shelton Benjamin won't be getting big enough of a push by the time 26 comes around. WWE have a way of not giving WWE superstars what they deserve.   And I don't think that Undertaker will retire at mania 26 if he did it would be against Kane who is the only man he would want to lose to at WrestleMania.   Kane should never be in a ladder match, especially MITB.   I don't think Trish will be champ but she should.   The rest is okay but I don't know if it will happen.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Kozlov doesnt deserve a main event spot at Mania fighting for the World title|`|CJzbIhWuaa	where is hbk? this will be his retirement date, not taker's, maybe 27, this isnt very good, i made one of these a while back and it blew this out of the water|`|4zKhGwLUaa	this is a STUPID question|`|YhfMrppSaa	cena vs orton    no      no      no    edge vs hhh    no, batista not in wm    no      maybe    ok      no      sorry bro, some of em not right. cena vs orton at wm    jeff vs matt or cage|`|3074it1Qaa	why are there 8 people in a MiTB match and Undertaker should have his retirement match against Kane|`|5nd1YeI4aa	wrestlemania 25 isnt even here yet y u doin this now?
UcHqXPpvaa	I have been pondering this same type of scenario since amare said he wanted to be traded. I like the trade, but it would be nice if the bulls could hang on to tyrus thomas and play him and stoudamire as the starters. I wonder if the trade would work with Joakim noah instead of thomas. I also think a 3rd team might have to be involved because gordon is an upgrade to barbosa as a 6th man, but barbosa is too good to take a major cut back in minutes, they should try to find a team to take on barbosa, perhaps for a backup big man for the bulls to make up for losing 2 bigs in the trade.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	That's a trade I can see happening. Either way I think he's going to the East. My guess is New York.|`|K8GL2mMRaa	I'm a Bulls fan and I would love that deal it would be perfect for both teams.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	sure! its a good trade!|`|AA10495394	If I am the suns I wouldn't make the move but it would be good for the bulls|`|9Injuk2zaa	Okay|`|NaKLLepEaa	its a good trade, im just not sure if the  suns would lose a good player--even though they would get a couple of good players back!!|`|oXBqioHRaa	he'll go to the pistons      rasheed and 1st round pick for amare

Unless you want to call all explorers and map makers heroes lewis and clark aren't much better. And really sackagawea, they're native american guide, kinda backstabed her people because as soon as the americans learned the land they removed the native americans.

QMveJrziaa	Benoit was the better wrestler, and Eddie was the better entertainer.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Technical wrestling ability? Chris was the better wrestler   Better wrestler? I actually have to say Eddie, Chris lacked mic skills and made up for that with his wrestling but Eddie was the complete package, entertaining to watch and technically brilliant. Being the best isn't about wrestling skill its about being an entertainer as well IMO.|`|ARVV7emOaa	eddie guerrero      nice lita picture|`|UWJinEbIaa	Eddie was the better overall pro-wrestler.  Guerrero could work as a face or heel, cut decent promos, and had an arsenal of rudo tactics that worked the crowd.  Eddie Guerrero could start near riots when he was working in Mexico.  Outside of "internet" fanboys and "tape traders" Benoit was not generally accepted by the wrestling fan base as a whole.    Black Tiger/Los Gringo Loco > Pegasus Kid/Wild Pegasus|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Better wrestler = Benoit    Better entertainer = Eddie|`|eJDRyYNaaa	Benoit|`|ZofcbEzvaa	chris|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	Chris by a mile.|`|Bp3bt5bCaa	Eddie Guerrero R.I.P    (Latino Heat Forever)|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Eddie|`|Gr7My8FTaa	you cant really decide because they were both very good wrestlers but if i had to decide i would say Chris Benoit     R.I.P Chris and Eddie|`|6u2YkXjlaa	Benoit was a better mat wrestler but Eddie had better mic skills so it's a tough call
WgcT04JGaa	People are mad because the Steelers ended the Cinderella story for the Cardinals. I for one am a long long time Steeler fan, not a band wagon jumper because they won, and what I saw was alot of penalties going against the Cardinals at first but the officiating team made up for it by hitting us with numerous ones later. Racisim has nothing to do with anything involved in this game. Should Harrison have been ejected from the game, I don't think so. There were alot of really cheap shots going on during that game. It is football not a tea party. What happened on Sunday is that the best team one in one of the most exciting games I as a long time football fan have ever watched. The Cardinals will be back they have too many weapons not to be. As for now I will listen to all the excuses on why the Cards lost and still know that the better team won and have now got 6 rings to prove that they are the real "America's Team". Off season now so Jerry Jones can start looking at all the recently released inmates from around the state of Texas to make his team alittle better. LOL.|`|PaMTtUXbaa	Hey, refs help you beat the seahawks, why not the cardinals?    plus, the owner thanked Obama...FOR WHAT??! Tomlin inherited a great team from Cower.  Wiz took a crappy team and took them to their first superbowl ever.    oops now i am a racist.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Definitely! If the Steelers were not so racist against whites, chances are they would have at least 2 white guys on their starting defense... where would that leave guys like Polamalu and Harrison? On the bench... without those 2 the Steelers wouldn't have had a chance...     Not to mention that Santonio Holmes character... if the Steelers had just one, white wide receiver and were required to throw him the ball as many times as they threw it to the black guys (I mean it has to be equal right) then chances are Holmes doesn't have the game of his career and the Steelers don't win the Superbowl...     D*mn those racist Steelers...|`|51ffe1363d554561e1aea841802c65b5aa	It was just an awsome game all around, but it did end on another sour note for NFL officiating on the last play for the cards which clearly shows a FORWARD pass, I've seen this same play called in the review booth, hand moving forward and ball moving forward and only the quarterbacks hands are touching the ball.  The only thing the NFL cheated the fans out of was a fair game with 22 seconds left and team in stricking distance of winning.   The NFL is Knee deep in corruption.|`|grBxTsK6aa	I think you should blame your parents for your knowledge of football, or lack thereof.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Racism, global warming, the economy.

Steeler fan or not you know it was dirty and uncalled for!|`|6Ojpl6viaa	Give it time.  They have cried about everything else.  It was a great game.  They are just upset that for the second time the Steelers stopped a team on there first trip to the SB from winning.  The better team that day won.  Drop it and get over it.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	No but they seem to be blaming it on everything else so it will probally make the list as well even though it has no merit|`|sPiwb8Hraa	No. I enjoy your questions Kaine.

Qx8U9JR2aa	Truck. There was a really good article about it in WWE Magazine over the summer. Those trucks you see with the wrestlers on them in the parking lot? That's the equipment.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	i would have to say by truck, it's much cheaper then flying things around all the time.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	WWE magazine had a whole article on the trucks that carry the equipment for WWE so it by truck.

6wSmZrrsaa	It was wiped off,  you guys should really read more into the story before coming on here and posting lies. GSP corner man Phil nurse was performing a routine that he normally does for GSP massaging his shoulders and chest and back. to give him more energy. When the CSAC brought it to their attention that they thought Vaseline was on GSP's back they wiped his back of immediately|`|4gwSrPhfaa	it seems his corner did apply vaseline on his chest and back when he was massaging him, however the athletic commission wiped GSP down after before every round so i highly doubt that the vaseline played much of a factor, GSP controlled the fight completely standing and on the ground, very rarly did Penn come close to putting GSP in danger, the vaseline however was a unfair advantage to GSP however since he did not put it on himself i dont c how its fair to fine him??, fine and maybe suspend the guy who put it on GSP, i dont think Penn will want a rematch bc he got broken down completely in every possible way and a rematch would probably be more of the same     oh and for the guy who had the question about the 170 weight limit, the rule is a fighter has to weight in at or under170 pound for the fight after that he can come in and fight at any weight he wants, most fighter usually regain 10 or 15 pounds in water and food after weight ins|`|QM2A6rBlaa	Umm yeah sure.|`|644561bc5c6b0a61400f820f69acc4b0aa	The pictures I saw did look pretty suspicious.  However, I will admit that I am not very versed in what the corner people tend to do to a guy's face when it is messed up (although GSP's didn't appear to be).  I would think at the very least, the corner was negligent.  However, it does look as though he purposefully got stuff off of his own arm and then rubbed it on GSP.  So I would suggest that it doesn't look good.  I would think that a corner shouldn't be allowed any contact with vaseline prior to entering the ring.  They should perhaps even get examined just like the fighters do before going in the ring.    I did read that they took GSP and wiped him down after they suspected vaeeline was used so I am not certain you couod say it won him this fight.  I do also think that GSP should have told his corner not to do that.  He should be held responsible for what his corner did.  Ultimately he had to have known what was being done.  I mean you cannot get that nasty stuff on you and not be aware of it I think.    Additional:  If GSP were really wiped down as they say (I didn't see the fight myself), I don't think his win should be called into question.  However, the UFC should police this kind of thing better so that people don't have their win called into question.|`|1Byis7Flaa	Yes, GSP and his corner cheated.   That Vaseline allowed GSP to slip out and not let BJ apply the triangle.  If you watch you'll see BJ's feet, arms just slide     I think GSP should be stripped of the belt.  Fined $  And if BJ wants a rematch, OK before any match takes place with Thiago,.    I don't understand how the weight limit is 170. yet GSP came in at 187|`|RR7UX4jkaa	YEs they cheated....but PENN still lost!......imagine if GSPs crew didn't cheat?....think of how worse Penn's beating could have been!!!!!!!!!!!  HA!|`|q3JKghxqaa	If so, then it has been said that it wasn't his fault. White said that he saw his corner accidently put it on his back, but it was wiped off immediately...
wbIEau0qaa	thats 2 over the hill fighters going at it. it could get good ratings but i doubt record setting|`|hIOkdSEFaa	who would want to buy that fight|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	money and promotion. with both huge losses the potential for profit is little to none. and who would want to see that fight?|`|6QhACK70aa	i mean who wanna see 2 old people  fighting???    did not see how joe and manny made them look??|`|R0J1W3BCaa	Maybe because Jones outweighs Oscar by 30 pounds.|`|7domw3t5aa	Never heard of such a fight. Was this recently?|`|2MqaBfkxaa	If this was suppose to happen it would be called off because Oscar only fights safe fights.  He doesn't fight guys bigger than him that can KO him like Bernard Hopkins did.  He chooses smaller fighters & guys that stand in front of him so he can pot shot them.  He didn't expect that Pacman could take his power but he didn't know that manny would stick & move & make it impossible for Oscar to respond.  He like guys like Ricardo Mayorga that stand right in front of you & take a whipping.  If Oscar fights again he will take on some stationary stiff that he knows he can beat & look good & then retire.  Roy is past his priime but he is faster & stronger than Oscar & would actually Knock Oscar out cold!!!!

dfBwVxXFaa	Alfalfa and clover is an excellent choice.  They won't turn that down. I promise!|`|QrjuueMCaa	We plant rye, alfalfa, clover, and turnips. Most of those will grow in almost any soil. Talk to the people at the feed mills and get it from them...That Bio Logic **** is WAY overpriced. First, test your soils PH and see what would naturally work best. You might just have to fertilize or lime it to make it just right. The above statment about apple trees is right also if you plan on hunting that same place in 8-10 years. We have apple and pear trees on our hunting property and they finally started blooming fruit last year. They take alot of care and oversight to make sure bunnies and other critters dont kill it the first bunch of years. Good luck!!|`|lmWqwpygaa	Many plant rye grass.

mFa5ZDtcaa	Sure, but it doesn't seem to bother them. I have one and it will sometimes take several pics of deer right in front of it and the deer don't seem to mind or pay it any attention.|`|5mxy4WaMaa	It depends.  If the flash is Infra Red (night vision) then no, they don't see it.  If the flash is Visible (like on a standard camera) then yes, they do see it.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	" Yes "|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	Yes, they do, but deer are much less flightly at night.  During the day, it would be hard to go within 100 yards of one in a truck, but at night, you can spotlight deer very easily.  They notice you (you have a huge flashlight), but they only run if you get too close.|`|2TB8p5fvaa	Yes.|`|SpiEasx5aa	Sure they see it but I've never seen one scared of it.  They don't run off when the flash goes off.|`|BTFFpdeOaa	Yes they do see the flash,but I believe the deer mistake it for either lighting or car headlights.I have pictures deer standing or feeding in front of the camera for 10 minutes or more at night!|`|ZokyeCFdaa	yes but it usually doesnt bother them|`|QrjuueMCaa	---Wow Mary, I've got to report you 2X today!!! Hope others do the same!!! You are one misguided woman. Stick to the gay and lesbian section.    To answer the question, they don't care or mind if they do see it. We got suckered into buying the infared ones with no flash for almost $400 each and just these last 2 years started getting the flash ones (all cuddeback) for about $200 less and we actually prefer the flash ones since the picture is much clearer. If they do see it, they don't care. Even the old bucks that are totally nocturnal don't mind it and come into our food plots and bait piles every nite. They were going to be our toughest customer, and they don't bat an eye.

SkRJNhuCaa	So your team has a history of foot and ankle problems.  That leads to 2 possible causes:  1) bad footwear  2) bad training regimen    Quite possibly both are happening at the same time.  Walking and running barefoot is a very good thing. It trains the muscles in your feet which makes the entire foot stronger (including the ankle) but you must take care to use proper technique or you could put too much stress on your heelbone.    See a doc, indeed get it X-rayed just to make sure it's not broken (though I suspect muscle damage).  You might want to take it very very easy on the training for a good while and get physiotherapy instead as well as having someone (the physio can help here) take a good long look at your walking and running technique, how you place and use your feet and ankles.  Last but not least, get your footwear looked at, you might need different shoes (running barefoot is even better).|`|eDCyle05aa	It could be a stress fracture, so you should go get it x-rayed. Or at least see what your doctor says about it.

I hope he is used in a more useful storyline than the past. He is extremely talented and strong. I just feel that he could be used for more than a "Mythical Nightmare" character to scare little children.

oAjbBLDpaa	I'm debating it because the harsh schedule may be too much for it. If I do, it'll be because of Chris Jericho. This man faced so much on his way up the ladder. In his first match, his relative went to the hospital and he still had to keep going, when he worked in Japan he was threatened to be killed for breaking a vase, and when he was in Mexico he was put at gunpoint by someone that had been giving him a ride. Through all this he continued and finally reached his dream and then rose to the main event of the WWF at the pinnacle of his career and he stopped. Then he came back again at he has shown us even more of his amazing abilities.|`|ZofcbEzvaa	Randy Orton and Edge|`|eVMoucX2aa	The divas, that have inspired me is like Chyna, Trish Stratus, Lita.

dfBwVxXFaa	the customer is always right!  Just put it on for him. He knows what he wants!|`|QrjuueMCaa	Show him to the limb saver section, I guess! My brother-in-law and I were shooting the 416 Rigby with 105 grain loads this weekend and he only goes about 125 lbs. I weigh around 220. He shot the same amount of rounds as me, and just as well. I don't think size really means **** when it comes to people that can shoot.|`|lmWqwpygaa	Assume this is a serious question-    If he adds the pad without cutting down the butt of the stock, then the scope or sights may be too far away from the aiming eye for proper aim.   I would think that the gun would come with a pad installed...if it were necessary.|`|xOReEw6Waa	I've had my 11 year old shoot my 30-06 with a decent factory pad, he did ok, but it was a little too much for him. This guy just wants to use a weapon he is comfortable with hunting out on the range to shoot more, at least I would be guessing that. If I put a Limbsaver on my 06 my son would be fine with it. I have a friend who is 5ft 7 and 145 pounds and he took his 375 H&H over to Africa and took Cape Buffalo and Elan, etc. Some people are not recoil sensitive at all. The wife of the Barnes Bullet owner used a 500 Nitro Express Double on her safaris.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I was 16 when I started hunting elk with my 338 win mag.  I never had any problems with recoil.  I'm still using it 16 years later.  Surprisingly, the thin, small people tend to be less recoil sensitive than the big sturdy ones.  They just give easier under recoil.  I'm assuming you're asking a hypothetical question as a gun smith.  I'd do as he asks.  Limbsaver recoil pads are great.  I'd then let him know if the recoil is too much still, to bring the gun back for a mercury tube or a muzzle brake.  Nothing like setting up future business.  I can guarantee if you lecture this guy about his selection of a gun, not only will you lose this job, but every future job he would throw your way.  I have a gun smith that I simply won't use because he talked down to me, like I didn't know what I was talking about.  I bought a cz550 in 416 Rigby.  I took it to him to have it glass bedded.  They are notorious for cracking the stocks if you don't.  He tried to talk me out of it, I have no idea why, but I've got a new gunsmith now, and he did a great job on that 416.  Not to mention he will handle all future gunsmithing needs that may arise.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Just tell him to take two (2*) Aspirin, and call you in the morning.*|`|4iZozOw4aa	to run and get in the back of the shop.  and tell them to put the gun down, and to call the police|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	To use a little common sense next time he feels the urge to get all macho with a rifle that's too powerful for him.|`|lB6J3qFAaa	How about putting on the recoil pad like the customer requested in the first place.|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	i would help him pick out what he wanted and get the job of installing it along with using a length of pull gauge to assure proper fit.  what if you went to a chevy dealer wanting a vette and the salesman said you were best suited to a cavalier ?  i would not assume his small stature would inhibit him from shooting.  one of my best friends has hunted half the planet with some guns that would be uncomfortable for me to shoot yet he weighs about 120 soaking wet and can drop game like a bad habit.

YIKES!   That could make for some entertaining racing activity.|`|iT8CNh6paa	Lots of suprises up front and in the back    Go Tony!! 6th|`|c3tADklmaa	I'll say it's scattered. Jeff Gordon last, while Menard luckily drew the pole, now I like it better if its real qualifying because luck happens!!!|`|EfVlOfmYaa	I think it is pretty cool! Paul's first race with his new team and he gets the pole! I think it is gonna be a very Excitin race!|`|n55igpCUaa	Was hoping Menard wouldn't get the pole, because the polesitter never wins XD    But, who knows? This could be the first!|`|RLQdhFWXaa	First person I thought of when Paul Menard got the pole was Mikey.  Congrats Mykey.    As for the line up.   Not to bad.   Looks like Junior and Kyle are side by side.   That should be interesting.  lol  Not a way to start out the year for Jeff  but I am sure he will make his way to the front no problem at all.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Congrats to Paul Menard and his fans. Dale Jr has a good starting place. This is like the 2nd time that Jeff Gordon has had to start from the rear, my friend is already having a melt down. Can't wait for the race. Also cool to see Elliott on the front row.    Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I'm not too sure of the format for the race itself, I sure don't agree with the new criteria for eligibility..  I like that Tony, Jr, and Bobby Labonte are starting near each other, but not that they are all starting near Vickers, Speed, Hamlin, Sorenson, and even Kyle Busch.. Any one of those guys can ruin the evening for a bunch of people... That close to each other, and in front of the entire field, well.. I just hope I'm wrong, but Saddler may end up on the track alone..  Other than that I see a whole lotta' passin' goin' on..|`|iO12Vjnvaa	I think it's great!!!!!  19 starting 2nd and  43 yes the  43 STARTING 3RD!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now Prez....hopefully you and I draft our way to the front and stay there the entire race and settle it between ourselves!!! LOL.    Just an opinion as always.|`|7RUMbREoaa	It is alright,I guess.I just hope that Jimmie and Joey team up and go to the front early.|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	Robby Gordon starts 13th.  That should be interesting.

GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE, AND LET'S HAVE SOME CLEAN RACING OUT THEIR BOYS!!!|`|Uaj4B84iaa	Not bad! I predicted Denny would get 5th and I was right, so I'm happy. And it's cool to see an underdog on the pole.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	It's definitely interesting. Menard was my second pick to win the pole, so I wasn't surprised about him winning it. And yes, congrats to him and straightedge. It will be interesting to see if Elliott and Reed can hook up together at the start of the race. It wouldn't surprise me if they pull off a 1-2 finish like the Penske cars did in the 500 last year. And it will be fun watching the drivers in the back work their way up to the front. Hopefully it will be a good race!|`|4l0yGuE9aa	It's interesting how they are paired up. I see Dale Jr and Kyle Busch will be starting side by side. There were a lot more of interesting pairs.    Denny Hamlin & Tony Stewart being old team mates.  Paul Menard and Elliot Sadler side by side    Heck ... If you look down the list it's almost like they tried to pair some people up. The only thing is that line-up will last about 2 laps and they will be swapping leads in the next 5 laps.|`|r5JwUTfPaa	haha Jeffy starts last! i hope he stays there.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	No matter how the lineup is its going to be great. Nascar is finally here! Whooo Hooooo!|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	It is just the luck of the draw but I did like the how the stats are for the guys that start up front for the shoot-out they usually have a good season.    Goooo Junior!|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	Look at Elliot Sadler sittin right up there in second place! Bet Prez is happy. There's a lot of interesting side by sides, this could be fun! Maybe it will be a knock out instead of a shoot out. Lol Either way, I can't wait for the start! Have a great evening all. Racing season is finally here! Good luck all!|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	My Driver is Tony Stewart,Glad he got in the top 10,He looked Great looking forward to the 1st race!|`|MqdSjSvnaa	It's okay.   I guess it doesn't really matter where he starts.  I'm just happy for the season to start!|`|uouq4KCvaa	Yeah it's the luck of the draw, but I was a little surprised with some that are upfront but I like it. And it could get a little interesting with some of the ones that are starting side by side. I can't wait til the shoot out! whooo hoooo, let's go racing boys!|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Menard won't stay up there long.|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Doesn't matter what we the fans think.....Nascar does whatever they want.    This entire format stinks!|`|9uqOBCypaa	I'm just glad cars are back on the track!!  But looking at the lineup, the most interesting part for me is going to be watching those guys at 25-28 coming up through the pack to the front.  And hoping that Logano and Waltrip don't start a big wreck.  No offense to either of them.  But Michael seems to crash quite a bit, and Logano is 18 years old.  A little rust, and inexperience could make for a big one.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	Looks good to me!!!!   GOOOOOOOOOOOOO  SMOKE  !!!!!|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i am just happy the season is about to start. The winter has been way to long and way too cold. It is time to start those engines!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    To answer your question with Sadler in second the lineup looks great to me.|`|JSryPP8faa	I'm glad for Mykey. We all know this track is designed for drafting so may the best drafter win.
LpR9sLSlaa	I'll take a 6-1 record over 5-3 ANY day  how does more losses make you better?    In the modern era (since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in pro football. The franchise has won the most total games, won the most divisional titles, earned the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations and has the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. It is also 2nd overall in playoff wins and season game wins.    The Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh. In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their "unbelievable" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games.    the Cowboys single handedly "won" the most hated team in the NFL recent;y in a poll    they got 49%, almost HALF of all the votes, all by themselves????!!!!  out of 32 teams, they got almost HALF !|`|hdCPF6rqaa	Pure and Simple Math:    6 > 5    Looks complicated?|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	both u guys are bandwagoners.|`|ZUWF4lrEaa	chad is stupid!!!! the cowboys r never gonna win anything...how can u speak about john elway like dat? he's a retard|`|8sfybuGZaa	just mean    GO CHAD C AND COWBOYS|`|OFi3jBSHaa	Hmmmm. Chad C can back up what he says.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	The Steelers Do Not Have:  20 Consecutive Winning Seasons.  The NFL All Time Leading Rusher.  *Most appearances in a Super Bowl (8)  *Most wins on Monday night Football (41)  *Most appearances in the NFC Championship game (14)  *The Cowboys' streak of 160 sold-out regular and post-season games included 79 straight sellouts at their home, Texas Stadium, and 81 straight sell-outs on the road.  *Cowboys are the most valuable football franchise in the world, with an estimated value of $1.612 billion.  *They are also one of the wealthiest teams in the NFL, generating almost $250 million in annual revenue.  *Most consecutive winning seasons (20, from 1966 to 1985)  *Most seasons with at least 10 wins (24)  *The team has earned the most postseason appearances (28, which includes another league record of 55 postseason games, winning 32 of them)  *The Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to win 3 Super Bowls in just 4 years. (Also the only other team to do that is the Pats)        Dallas best vs Steelers best    Passing Leader (all-time): Troy Aikman - 32,942 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Emmitt Smith - 17,162 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Michael Irvin - 11,904 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Tom Landry - 250 wins    Passing Leader (all-time): Terry Bradshaw - 27,989 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Franco Harris - 11,950 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Hines Ward - 9,780 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Chuck Noll - 193 wins      The Steelers got 6 championships in 76 years. Dallas has won it 5 times 49. I'm not great at math but by my account, we have 27 years to catch up. They still trail us 32-31 in playoff wins despite nearly a 3 decade head start and our more than dozen year drought in the postseason.            No better example than a full look at the Steelers'  wins to date and the super-skimpy margin by which  they won:    SB 9......16-6 over Minnesota  SB 10.....21-17 over Dallas.......4 pt margin (poor)  SB 13.....35-31 over Dallas.......3 pt margin (poor)  SB 14.....31-19 over Rams.........12 pt margin (acceptable)  SB 40.....21-10 over Seattle......11 pt margin (acceptable)  SB 43.....27-23 over Cards.........4 pt margin (poor)    Dallas' lowest victory is 10 points (over Steelers).  Here's a look at the whole thing, which shows  that both defensively and offensively every Dallas  team has been head and shoulders above every Steeler  team no matter what decade.    SB 6.....24-3 over Miami...........21 pt margin  SB 12....27-10 over Denver.........17 pt margin  SB 27....52-17 over Buffalo........35 pt margin  SB 28....30-13 over Buffalo........17 pt margin  SB 30....27-17 over Pittsburgh.....10 pt margin        In their first 5 Super Bowl victories:  Dallas................scored a total 160 points  Pittsburgh............scored a total 124 points        Since 1933, Pittsburgh record is 520-488  Since 1960 Dallas is 423-309  http://www.pro-football-reference.com/te...    Dallas leads all time series 14-13      Jerry Jones has 3 championships in 20 years.  I can only think of one other owner that has that.  Horrible owner isnt he?        Now the Romo argument an the haters    Romo has played in 39 NFL games with 81 tds and 46 ints and is 0-2 in the playoffs    Jim Kelly thru his first 44 games threw 56 tds and 45 ints and it took him 3 years to win in the playoffs. He is now in the HOF. Buffalo should have cut him    Warren Moon in his first 45 games threw 40 tds and 59 ints and it took him 4 years to win in the playoffs. He is now in the HOF. He sucked too I guess    John Elway in his first 42 games threw 47 tds and 52 ints and it took him 5 years to win in the playoffs. He is now in the HOF. The worst yet, what a joke this guy was. Why did Denver keep him?        Since 2006 when Romo started playing    Romo    fumbles-12  ints-46    Roethlisberger  fumbles-12  ints-49      I appreciate it Stern.

The obvious answer is 5-3. That means they've been there 8 times as opposed to 7. The Cowboys fought hard to make it and made it for one more year than the steelers did. Props to Chad C.
Nmeoi5fBaa	your right, just because you get to the big game doesnt mean you are good|`|qywhxSctaa	You are obviously right. Success isn't measured by losing Super Bowls.

They are definitely one of the best franchise in NFL history, whether or not the Steelers are better than them.    I agree, appearance don't mean much. I should know, my Broncos were in 6 SBs and only won 2 of them.    Both team are very good, and I could argue for either side. It would be pointless and never ending, though.      EDIT- Ironpump is right. The Giants are 3-1 in Super Bowls.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Very Dumb Ain't no way the Bills are better then the Giants, Its like the Vikings are better then the Patriots which you know that its not true.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	No, Dallas is NOT better because they have been to 8 Super Bowls.  They are better for many other reasons.    Not sure where you got that info from?  Again, here is why they are better.  Im not here to call you names like you call me. I have more class then that.  Keep it up though, ive been thru worse then being called names on the internet.    The Steelers Do Not Have:  20 Consecutive Winning Seasons.  The NFL All Time Leading Rusher.  *Most appearances in a Super Bowl (8)  *Most wins on Monday night Football (41)  *Most appearances in the NFC Championship game (14)  *The Cowboys' streak of 160 sold-out regular and post-season games included 79 straight sellouts at their home, Texas Stadium, and 81 straight sell-outs on the road.  *Cowboys are the most valuable football franchise in the world, with an estimated value of $1.612 billion.  *They are also one of the wealthiest teams in the NFL, generating almost $250 million in annual revenue.  *Most consecutive winning seasons (20, from 1966 to 1985)  *Most seasons with at least 10 wins (24)  *The team has earned the most postseason appearances (28, which includes another league record of 55 postseason games, winning 32 of them)  *The Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to win 3 Super Bowls in just 4 years. (Also the only other team to do that is the Pats)        Dallas best vs Steelers best    Passing Leader (all-time): Troy Aikman - 32,942 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Emmitt Smith - 17,162 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Michael Irvin - 11,904 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Tom Landry - 250 wins    Passing Leader (all-time): Terry Bradshaw - 27,989 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Franco Harris - 11,950 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Hines Ward - 9,780 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Chuck Noll - 193 wins      The Steelers got 6 championships in 76 years. Dallas has won it 5 times 49. I'm not great at math but by my account, we have 27 years to catch up. They still trail us 32-31 in playoff wins despite nearly a 3 decade head start and our more than dozen year drought in the postseason.            No better example than a full look at the Steelers'  wins to date and the super-skimpy margin by which  they won:    SB 9......16-6 over Minnesota  SB 10.....21-17 over Dallas.......4 pt margin (poor)  SB 13.....35-31 over Dallas.......3 pt margin (poor)  SB 14.....31-19 over Rams.........12 pt margin (acceptable)  SB 40.....21-10 over Seattle......11 pt margin (acceptable)  SB 43.....27-23 over Cards.........4 pt margin (poor)    Dallas' lowest victory is 10 points (over Steelers).  Here's a look at the whole thing, which shows  that both defensively and offensively every Dallas  team has been head and shoulders above every Steeler  team no matter what decade.    SB 6.....24-3 over Miami...........21 pt margin  SB 12....27-10 over Denver.........17 pt margin  SB 27....52-17 over Buffalo........35 pt margin  SB 28....30-13 over Buffalo........17 pt margin  SB 30....27-17 over Pittsburgh.....10 pt margin        In their first 5 Super Bowl victories:  Dallas................scored a total 160 points  Pittsburgh............scored a total 124 points          Now the Romo argument an the haters     Romo has played in 39 NFL games with 81 tds and 46 ints and is 0-2 in the playoffs    Jim Kelly thru his first 44 games threw 56 tds and 45 ints and it took him 3 years to win in the playoffs. He is now in the HOF. Buffalo should have cut him    Warren Moon in his first 45 games threw 40 tds and 59 ints and it took him 4 years to win in the playoffs. He is now in the HOF. He sucked too I guess    John Elway in his first 42 games threw 47 tds and 52 ints and it took him 5 years to win in the playoffs. He is now in the HOF. The worst yet, what a joke this guy was.  Why did Denver keep him?        Since 2006 when Romo started playing    Romo     fumbles-12  ints-46    Roethlisberger  fumbles-12  ints-49|`|LVjM9k8yaa	You just won the Super Bowl, go to Disneyworld and shut up.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!
Qz80EA45aa	I can see a win or two each for Harvick and Burton. But the 07 and 33 are in for a tough year. Mears got the goldmine and Bowyer got the shaft. Mears comes right into a winning team, that has made The Chase for the past couple years. And poor old Clint get booted down to a team starting from scratch. I just can't figure out why RCR thought it was a good idea to throw all the 07's team chemistry out the window, just for an also-ran like Mears.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	All decent drivers...well Casey has to prove himself but I see him doing better than last season...from highest to lowest in points my prediction is:  1. Jeff Burton  2. Kevin Harvick  3. Clint Bowyer  4. Casey Mears|`|n55igpCUaa	Jeff Burton 3rd in points with 2 wins, 7 top 5s and 20 top 10s.    Clint Bowyer 5th in points with 1 win, 10 top 5s and 18 top 10s.    Kevin Harvick 7th in points with 1 win, 6 top 5s and 15 top 10s.    Casey Mears 14th in points with 1 win, 3 top 5s and 9 top 10s.|`|eTaK695Faa	Harvick and Burton make the Chase, finishing  5th and 7th (not sure which order though).   Bowyer just misses making the Chase (blame it on new team needing time to come together, and it happened just a little too late, but he will win a Chase race).  Mears struggles, has some really good finishes, but has some really bad ones too. Runs hot or cold. either top 15 or bottom 15 most of the season.    Just a side note Yahoo! sports is doing a top 20 count down for 2009 and there are only four spots left to reveal and no Harvick yet. (also missing are  Kyle Busch, Carl Edwards and Jimmie Johnson, from who I think they are going to put up)|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Just fine, and I wish Casey some really good luck with his new team, this year...|`|sJs0nuTSaa	Harvick will make it into the Chase, but won't become champion.  I don't think anyone from RCR will become Champion this year.|`|rAnyKQ0xaa	Well as you can see from my screen name, I am hoping for Harvick to win the championship..I do not think that will happen this year however.. I do think that he will finish either 3 or 4 this year.     I think Burton will finish 5th  Bowyer will finish 10th  Mears will finish 14th|`|xRsiYmxPaa	harvick will do good in 3rd in pooint 3 wins|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I think he will be in the hunt for the title..................|`|icTRTBAraa	They all do pretty good with Casey Mears we'll see how that goes.  I think they will do good.  I would love to see Jeff Burton with the Championship and he can do it he has been soooooo close yet not yet.  This could be his year.|`|rxCwaaG4aa	I agree with Maggie. As long as Burton is getting decent equipment he will do good. Harvick is really consistent. Bowyer is very solid for a young driver. And Mears will do what he has done his whole career, run in the middle of the pack. If he can't run up front consistently in HMS equipment he isn't going to in RCR cars. He just makes poor decisions on the track in my opinion.|`|3e1ELOgnaa	I think Harvick will get back on his winning ways and compete for the title this year! He'll finish no worse than 3rd in the final points.|`|uouq4KCvaa	i think they will do pretty good. I expect to see some wins from Kevin Harvick.|`|rVRE6742aa	if rcr could make their cars just a little bit faster, i would go out on a limb and say that they could win the championship.  with how awesomly consistent they are, if they were just faster jj kyle and carl would be very worried.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	Mediocre, top 10's and 15's all year but no wins.
YwgGcERMaa	The Midnight Express and Jim Cornette vs The Road Warriors and Precious Paul Ellering- The  Starcade 1986 Scaffold match  was a true classic|`|bOAJBQP3aa	I agree with you|`|6E16tR6xaa	Dx vs Rated Rko. Went all the way to Hell in a Cell.|`|JiCfYfLraa	there were way too many like the hardy boyz vs edge and christian one of my favorites. also the hardy boyz vs the radicalz tha hardy boyz had the best tag team feuds they were so edgy.|`|T13xM9iJaa	I would have to say E&C vs the Hardys vs the Dudleys their match where just amazing espicaly their match at WM17|`|4zKhGwLUaa	they are all boring|`|d9tCS7BPaa	In my opinion, the 3 way tag feud between the Hardys, Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz. Especially when it escalated to the TLC match at WM17 in Houston, Tx. The match was just epic!|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	That was a good one, didn't they have a six man title at that time.    How about the Hardy's vs Edge and Christian?|`|DfPyyDssaa	Bruiser & Crusher vs The Vachons.|`|SVZl9oqxaa	Freebirds were before my time so I can't really comment on that one.    I would go with The Hardy Boyz against Edge and Christian. These guys had a feud that was so good, that all four of them became main eventers because of it.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I would put the Von Erichs vs The Freebirds at number two, behind The Rock & Roll Express vs The Midnight Express.  They feuded for quite a few years over the NWA/WCW World Tag Team Titles.  Both teams were excellent wrestlers with outstanding teamwork; their matches never got stale.    Throw in Jim Cornette (manager for The Midnight Express and one of the greatest mic-workers of all time) and it gets even better.  Ricky Morton (of the Rock & Roll Express) was excellent on the mic, too.  Great promos, great matches, great feud.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Rock-n-Roll Express v. Midnight Express
NmfEaN3Uaa	Well... I take Shotokan Karate. But I train and spar sometimes with a friend who does Tae Kwon Do. Pus I just know a decent amount about most styles.... By the way Tae Kwon Do does Kata's to...they just call them Forms or something.    They are pretty even IF and only IF you train in serious Tae Kwon Do. Sport Tae Kwon Do like they do in the olympics is a joke and isn't very useful at all. But traditional tae kwon do is a good style and uses more hand techniques then people think, though they do lean towards their kicks. But if you watched the Olympics you would think it was ALL kicks.    Personally I prefer Karate. It just is such a well rounded style....teaches all different sorts of techniques. No real specialty or trademark. Plus I love the tradition and history behind it. Up to the instructor really... a good instructor in any style will make the style fun/useful.|`|S6vXpU7Caa	Karate is much better. You see Tae kwon do is just Japanese Karate with higher kicks and poor stance. Also Karate has throws, flips, arm bars and wrist locks that you won't find in Tae kwon do.  You see during WW2 the Japanese taught Karate to some Koreans, but the Koreans did,nt learn that much so they didn't get that deep of a understanding of the arts.  After the war the Koreans Developed a anti Japanese attitude so these guys that made it up to maybe third degree decided to start their own art and call it Tae kwon do, and make it more Korean, by having higher kicks, (because they think its a insult to punch a man in the face, but not to kick him there)? Then  they decided to out do the Japanese by making themselves tenth dans, when the Japanese only recognize them as 3rd.  The problem they had was they didn't know enough to do that.  That is why tae kwon do looks to bad next to Karate.|`|jvRZfkvRaa	I am a brown belt in shorei ryu karate and I just started so bhak do again.       For me the karate is my core art and I take so bahk and mold it to work for me.     shorei is more of a aggressive and powerful art. Where as so bhak will teach you flow, speed. and striking.     If you can find good teachers in both arts and you keep a open mind the two will mix well with each other|`|KvyB0E77aa	Krav Maga    It combines both|`|AA11264943	I like aspects of both of them, but I would choose TKD because I really like to kick and fight from distance.     James|`|VfvZLTO9aa	tai quan do because i get erections when I do it.|`|MzCL0dzjaa	Well I don't take them but my school teaches them and I know which I'd prefer. TK would be funner. Karate is a lot of kata's which are just ways to move your hands to block stuff it's really dumb and I find it completely useless and so do people who actually take karate who have gotten in real fights.|`|tNfsKZwgaa	i personally think that karate is better, because Sponge Bob does it, and if Sponge Bob likes karate, then it must be cool. my opinion. i don't know what all you fools above me are talking about. ?|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	i like karate|`|mWhIAXqXaa	Answer: tae kwon do    because karate is too "soft" for me  and tae kwon do does more kicks and i like to kick =D|`|paCHaDWVaa	I did Tae Kwon Do for several years when i was growing up. I enjoyed it because it taught me a lot of self defense, I talk to people that did karate and they just look like they were throwing themselves around. I am pretty confidant with myself after learning Tae Kwon Do.|`|JD5zXRUZaa	karate was better because it can help you defend your self more. i think tae kwon doe is in the olympics that's how you know you cant really hurt someone. i think the best martial art is muy thai. you should check that out please it is so much fun.|`|H5EYUh69aa	Personally I preferred Karate because it teaches much more about the fighting styles I am more interested in.    I like to use my hands, I'm better with my hands and when I first began, It came more natural to me to use my hands more so than my legs.    Both are tremendous to take up though, and both together are so much better than doing one alone because it gives you the chance to work BOTH hands and legs evenly and give your work full power all round to better and increase performance.

Sean Taylor getting killed is the greatest one but that was last year.|`|30LMCJrAaa	Benching Matt Leinart was huge, Whisenhunt is a heck of a coach, it allowed Kurt Warner to show his greatness once again. That to me was the one most significant thing to affect the NFL this year.|`|dFAbkSWkaa	all|`|S2gIzdg9aa	of course it was the salary cap i know because thats what got my cowboys down the path to no where because jerry jones cant spend big time money to go and get the big time players.|`|erEd506Vaa	sean taylor and micheal vick R.I.P sean taylor and whatever to vick|`|tNerdFYsaa	The Tom Brady IR.

One of my favourite wrestlers and one of my favourite artists.|`|lr68XuMFaa	Jim Morrison has been dead since 71' but John Morrison does resemble him to the point|`|2KOHAhQNaa	The similarity is one of the reasons for the name change from johnny nitro as well as wanting to get away the nitro name (he was originally named after WCW nitro)|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I agree, they are trying to make him look and act like the guy from the doors. he's a little too short though in my opinion|`|k2fFfNtRaa	I agree.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	He also does Chucky Cheese. I mean where do people come up with this junk?|`|AA11482019	I disagree.  John Morrison is really John Hennigan,

1uSoU8Lpaa	No, and there's more to it than a player got caught doing something illegal and no one being able to protect him from the consequences. It's more that if an athlete commits a crime he needs to pay the price.     Some players just need to grow a brain cell and use it to think about what they're doing.|`|TCehI17kaa	No contract should reward criminal behavior period. No player should be above the law.|`|cM3jYmIYaa	It's his choice to do that. Only a Cubs fan would be dumb enough to ask that you moron.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	he's a celebrity for GOD's sake leave him alone. ahhhhhhhhh|`|utTFiz3gaa	Nope. A person is a person, the law is a law... if i killed someone and (*insert player/celebrity here*) killed someone then we should BOTH be serving time.. preferably in the same place cuz at least i can say that i shared a cell with a famous person ;)|`|2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	No contract can protect you from prosecution for criminal behavior.|`|NOEJMDfiaa	Absolutely not. No one, not even the highest elected official, should be above the law. When it comes to criminal activity no one should be able to avoid the law because of their profession.

Don't make this sport gay. People in Mixed Martial Arts do it for the passion... self-glory... honor... and most importantly, their PRIDE.....    It's not because people bully. I was bullied as a freshman... i'm huge now, and i discouraged bullying in my school. I also love mixed martial arts, but thats because of my size and i had no other sports to participate in at my highschool.

z7JsVzcnaa	Obama may have smoked pot in the past, but that's his past.  Not now.  I personally don't think it's a huge deal.  However, he does need to understand that because he's famous, he needs to be smarter if he wants to smoke weed.  3 months is a slap on the wrist, but it should be enough for him to get the idea that he shouldn't do things that will look bad to the public.|`|MqAsRUlAaa	Its his personal life, they should care if he smoked pot. He won the most metals in the swimming Olympics, hes obviously not doing anything wrong with his life just relieving stress.|`|Jci78CbRaa	Mariguana is illegal|`|QASHySUbaa	i think he should have been suspended longer or kicked out of swimming|`|UtYRJvo9aa	THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SMOKED WEED.

So no I don't think its fair at all.|`|37091dabffe27d3c6a40af6a0ff5d0d0aa	it's being blown way out of proportion! and really people aren't going to start smoking because michael phelps is smoking and people aren't going to look at the US as pothead country more than they already do. People smoke weed all the time it's uncontrollable get over it.|`|AGXysOpzaa	I totally get that people make mistakes, but Michael needs to realize he's a star now. People idolize him. People everywhere see him and think, "wow. that guy there, he's amazing. I want to be like him."  He needs to know he's an example of success for millions of people and when they see him acting irresponsible with drugs, it's a big deal. We see celebrities like Amy Winehouse or Lindsay Lohan do drugs all the time and we don't really give much of a damn, but Michael Phelps is a respected athlete. A few years ago he got arrested for a DUI and he said he was sorry and we believed him. But now here he is smoking pot and he says he's sorry again. Is he really sorry, or is he just sorry he got caught?    Anyway, enough of that ranting, I do think he should be penalized, but not so much that he can't compete in the next olympics. Whether or not he smoked pot at a college party, he's still the best in the world.|`|jvFhoov7aa	i think he deserves the penalization. There is no need for drugs and if he wants to keep his career in line he needs to keep his health in line.|`|iUMrjbh2aa	Hell naw! WEED? Are you serious? Crack and any other is WAY worse than that! Get real. that is so stupid!!!|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	Not at all! Weed should be legal! People who believe otherwise are stupid and uneducated about pot!

Will you overlook Charles Barkley's drunk driving or Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens steriod use -- why does Micheal Phelps deserve a break and others do not. Floyd Landis was stripped for his wrong actions. Phelps deserves no break.|`|fXQGUM75aa	Lots of people are murders but that shouldn't mean that murdering is legal and should be nonpunishable. He dug his own grave. I am in high school and I'm not doing drugs. It's illegal and he shouldn't be getting off the hook just cause he said sorry. We might treat him as a legend but I would be outraged if the law did as well. i'm disappointed that my role model even got himself in this situation in the first place.|`|dFAbkSWkaa	yes because he is a inert national  champion and figure for the US and him to be doing drugs is going to be protrayed as the United States as a whole
OHs8yJiOaa	Sounds as good as anything. It tends to not blend too well just mixing it with regular water, so I myself have simply decided to use other things or sometimes use it pre-mixed. I believe some people mix it then freeze it until use -- I expect that's primarily to help it be cold rather than help it mix better though.    If you're going to use it from powder, your coach's method sounds likely the best of anything I've heard.

QcmNHRzyaa	you don't need a LP tank. just got with HP|`|7Pq8k3bbaa	None.  Use a high pressure tank.
RuJYupFWaa	Having a low output tank won't affect the number of shots you'll get.  Here's the shot count equation for hpa tanks:    For 4500 psi tanks: 15 x cubic inches = shots  For 3000 psi tanks: 10 x cubic inches = shots    So your tank gets about 1350 shots, although the efficiency of the gun itself could vary that number.|`|qE49jbVaaa	go with the steelers

LeBron James was named the NBA's Eastern Conference Player of the Month for the second time this season and ninth time in his career.  In 14 January games, James averaged 27.5 points on .456 shooting, 9.6 rebounds and 8.1 assists per game. He ranked first in triple-doubles (3), second in points per game (27.5), assists (8.1), and steals (2.1), tied for fourth in rebounds (9.6) and double-doubles (8), and ranked 10th in blocks (1.5).    He scored 20 or more points in 13 games and 30 or more points six times. He also had three triple-doubles in the month. The Cavs were 10-4 in January.|`|XkBzfEBUaa	Careerwise:  Kobe (maybe time will tell)  Better at getting out of trouble:  Kobe  Better at leaping over things:  Kobe    Better at basketball at the present time:  Lebron    Lebron now vs. Kobe at Lebron's age:  Lebron  Kobe career vs. Jordan career:  Jordan  Kobe skillz vs. Jordan skillz:  Jordan  Kobe skillz vs. Lebron skillz:  push    but all in all Lebron is a better basketball player, unless it's a one on one game (which the NBA is not), but if you consider Kobe better because of his (ballhogging) one on one skills, then why not include every great streetballer in the mix?   Based on the NBA, Lebron is by far superior|`|4DcvpQXfaa	i'm bored but MJ is the GOAT!|`|AukGqk17aa	I answrered this Question 1 SECOND ago    KOBE has a better career    LEbron is better this season    i answered this question 1001 times    Kobe is better    "END OF The STORY"|`|oMYGtqubaa	KOBE.    Lebron is a great player in his own right... BUT, he's NOT QUITE at Kobe level yet.       It REALLY comes down to CLUTCH performances....  Kobe's done it a million times...  and Lebron just never really has.     Once he closes that gap, THEN we have a real discussion.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	LeBron hands down|`|ExVTrokAaa	Kobe!  Did you not see Kobe beat Lebrons 50pts at MSG with 61pts!  BTW he shot only 37% of the teams total shots while shooting an amazing 61%.      haha Looks like a lot of Lebron lovers answered this questiona and gave anyone that said kobe thumbs down. lol|`|bx1PqQRwaa	Kobe is all about hmself and flash, and busting up womens backside (if you know what I mean)  LeBron - Is a team player, and an amazing talent. He puts the team first, and stays out of trouble and is smarter than Kobe, even though he is much younger.|`|x7qtyglzaa	At this moment, Kobe is the best.|`|8f5b3518bbb478f324587b828536a78eaa	Kobe needs help to win games, such as Gasol and Bynum, while Lebron needs only role players to assist him.|`|kMzDp2Byaa	whatever  u say, i just like and always support kobe//    he is and will always be my hero//    just go|`|RPqvFsLVaa	Kobe hands down|`|Lj0d5vIJaa	.....not a ? that can be answered in the long run, but in my opinion Kobe is more accomplished making him a better player.|`|FCrRFcb5aa	Kobe is fast and can cross over Lebron..  And Lebron cant really defend Kobe cause he usually crosses him over and gets the jumper.  (but last time Kobe tried to dunk Lebron stuffed him soo bad)..    But Lebron is fast too and much stronger than Kobe..  And Lebron can dunk over Kobe.. so i would say Lebron would be MVP..|`|8c78Qlpxaa	can you really compare an SG to an SF?    just the size and monster power of lebron easily gave him the edge...look at him...is there any1 who is tall as him and accelerates that fast and is developing a jump shot...its like chamberlain has been revived...it seems his body was built in a lab...comparing the two is unfair for both of them... comparing a forward to a guard... wade and kobe would make more sense...|`|VBV6Bwrzaa	kobe is the best player right now    and it's not a good question to ask    kobe is at his peak  while lebron is just starting    bring this question up in a year or two  and then it will be more fair    go lakers!!!!!!
30LMCJrAaa	Rex will be picked up by someone. Maybe Minnesota or Detroit. And, he may develop into something special.     He has all the physical tools, he just needs to mature into being a good decision maker.    I wish all the best to him. I think the Bears gave up a little too soon...|`|BqVcz1R1aa	Super Bowl Champs in 2009 season!  Believe!      He brought them there before....he will do it again...except with a win and all..|`|OyHCQkjhaa	dude his contract is over.  He aint even on the Bears next season.  Plus why would they even let him in during the 4th?|`|QjO3m7QKaa	The Bears aren't re-signing Rex. They already signed Brett Basanez. Unlike other fans, I think  Kyle Orton is the solution to the long term QB problem. Look at his stats before his injury. That's the Kyle Orton us fans saw before he got injured that day. Then his stats declined. My point is the fact that Rex blew off too many chances to gain the starting job.|`|DkwgogXZaa	anything's possible...but he throws a lot of picks....he needs to improve his decision making....watch some Big Ben tapes....|`|fHxpycJSaa	Grossman's days as a starter are over. He's a clipboard carrier from here on out. He will only start due to an injury to the actual starter. If he wins a teams QB competition, that team is in BIG, BIG trouble.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	He has flashes of brilliance, but usually tries to hard, & ends up doing something stupid!!!!|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I can see him when a Championship, but not with the Bears.|`|yg3Pveakaa	I still believe he is much capable of leading his team not Orton..He has no arm and is a sitting duck in the pocket for a sack..Well who knows if they can get another big play WR in the draft they can be really good..They already have their defense set with Urlacher, Briggs and Harris in the middle so I say they have a chance..

2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	It happens sometimes but usually only at the lower belts.  Someone will have some skills and previous experience in another similar martial art and the ability to learn things faster.   Also once in a while you get a person that is just a super athlete who is driven and has the time to practice and learns quickly.  While this is less common it does happen especially if they have learned a good portion of the requirements for that next belt.  You almost never see this beyond the intermediate belts though.|`|LUnscegvaa	It happens!!!!    Some times people progress faster than others.    Best wishes :)***|`|C0sT0PPyaa	only 1 time every 5000 years or so.  actually this is part of the shotokan test...first you given and extra belt...now you have to go to the dojo and kick the sensei in the nuts or you fail|`|MzCL0dzjaa	that's pretty fast to be promoted....are you in the little babies class|`|g7xaB57Xaa	I took Shotokan karate for years in IL.  I can tell you moving up a belt happens once in a while for sure.  If you also had a stripe system like I did, you have to look at it as how well they think you did in terms of the stripes.  When I did my best I went up 3 stripes, other times I went up two, but I only once went from Yellow to Orange. (I went White/Yellow/Orange/Green/Blue/Purple/Br... Black)  If you do everything near perfect, you will skip a belt depending on who watches and grades your tests and who you are testing with or with at the same time.  As for what you can do, work on keeping a low stance and stay appropriately level when you move, be crisp and firm without pausing at the end of your strikes and moves, don't forget get breathing spirit, and keep it tight and balanced during basics and kata.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	That happens from time to time. Especially if you have previous training in another style or have ever taken karate before. Their theory is that you will be able to catch up quickly.    A guy just joined my club actually and he jumped to orange the same day as I tested for orange. It felt wierd me helping him with katas when he's the same belt as me...

tY3rZSsiaa	what else do you expect from dantoni?  they dont have any presence inside the paint area, so teams can attack all night against the knicks.  their backcourt defense isnt good either, they just dont have defensive players.  add that to dantonis coaching style, and you have no defense.|`|GswnLKtQaa	they play mike d' antoni style. small ball and pure offence. they sacrifice defence for their run and gun style.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Mike D'Antoni's system/style of play doesn't emphasize much defense at all. When he coached at Phoenix they were simply fortunate enough to outscore their opponents.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	they are undersized|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	They lack size, a true center, and toughness. Also, as you note they play very little defense.|`|q2EafutHaa	They don't seem to believe in defense with D'Antoni. That's the same thing that happened in phoenix with him. Now D'antoni has less talented players and he's trying to run the same scheme of just scoring a lot of points.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	they have no good blockers!|`|aWfsNZyLaa	two words... they suck.  Its been that way since Ewing left.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	They have no 7 footers.....    even their front court David Lee and Al Harrington rarely blocks... but gets the rebound....    They need good center at least... to make the opposing team feel SOME PRESSURE AT LEAST....|`|kFcdwVwdaa	they are not a defensive team. under dantoni's system (run n gun), there is no defense.  if they steal the ball or get a turnover they have quick guys to beat you down the court and score.   they will try to outscore you. look at the knicks now and the suns of then.|`|bU2rGQHSaa	They play Mike D'Antoni's system, which is pretty much a run and gun offense.  They also have no legit big man.  And I think even if they had a defensive-minded coach, they would still be awful defensively because of their roster.  I don't think anyone on that entire team can play a lick of defense!!!      They're certainly a far cry from the great, physical 90's Knick teams of Ewing, Oakley, Starks, Mason and co.|`|oMYGtqubaa	The Knicks "uptempo offense" is their defense under D'Antoni.    BUT, if you're referring to giving up 61 to Kobe...  you have to understand the Knicks put their BEST DEFENDERS against him  Wilson Chandler and Jared Jeffries.....   And FRANKLY, when you have a GREAT player who is in the zone like that it doesn't really matter WHO guards them.    Michael Jordan dropped tons of points on that Ewing, Oakley, Mason, Starks group... and that was one of the BEST DEFENSES of that era.    GREAT PLAYERS are called that for a reason.|`|pgVxoM5xaa	They are trying to play Phoenix's style of basketball, but don't have the right players. And you can't look at points-per-game-allowed, because they typically have more possessions than other games. Look at field goal percentage allowed, where New York ranks 28th.
IezA7SGSaa	let him leave    just tell him keep going    don't come back.|`|1Byis7Flaa	2 are utterly important. Because the first he must accept what he did was wrong, and show he understands by writing it out.   The second, because he respects himself, and he respects his teammates, and asks for the teammates forgiveness.  The third, for the teammates to decide his team punishment.      Make him write a letter about the importance of self control, discipline, and respecting authority.  Then make him apologize to the entire team for his selfishness  And have a team meeting and let them decide if he should:  Practice by having 3 minutes with the 3 best guys (any weight)  but the same age level. So, he can get a GOOD practice in.  Or run 25 laps around the gym while every one else is practicing    (run fast or slow , or slow jog or walk)  And if he ever walks out again, he is suspended for 2 meets or something.|`|SC65xdUraa	i would try something like laps or extra push-ups or something that takes physical effort. but if that doesn't faze the athlete then maybe  don't let them play for awhile; suspended them, see what happens with that. it could work well if the student enjoys the sport and likes playing it.|`|TGuyq4sGaa	He wont learn if you make him do anythign by himself.  What my coach made us do is WORK AS A TEAM.  SO if he wanted to leave a practice he is part of the team which means you all have to play as a team. I walked out once for practice once and came back and we had to run around in the room with the heater on for like 1 hour. Let me tell you that brought us together as a team and it never happend agian. So make them like run as a team showing that if 1 person messes up they are all in it together as a team. They will become much closer if you dont just punish 1 person. Believe me from experience it work! haha  Well good luck in the season.|`|AA10930794	If he has done this before, the ONlY punishment is to suspend him for the rest of the season.A coach can't allow this example for the rest of the team.|`|AA11605092	I would lock the door behind him. I don't want him back today, tomorrow, this season, or next. Good bye, thanks for playing.

1P5qWMQ0aa	It is a great achievement, but many people on this section are too ignorant to even take a second look at it.  They will sit back and call Phil Jackson the best coach of all time even though he coaches professionals.  Pat Summit and the likes of Dean Smith, John Wooden, Bob Knight etc. are(were) the best coaches in the world.  They coach(ed) college kids, not professionals.  They deserve more recognition than they get.|`|664ed7c497f31f81a6f78917f2d649eeaa	she is the best coach ever in collage ball, men's and woman's. hands down the greatest!! i say some   on ESPN that really impressed me...8 Champions(she has had back to back and a 3-peat in here years there) 32 straight seasons with 22 or more wins(amazing),has been in the NCAA Tournament 26 straight years(since they started the Tournament for the women), more win than ANY program....yes PROGRAM in woman's ball, and in women's ball you think UConn, and Louisiana Tech and she alone has more wins the either of these schools.  Give this woman her dues and accept her as the greatest.|`|fHxpycJSaa	It's the equivalent of 33 wins for 33 years. That is very impressive. She is a real coach.|`|WZvny7mMaa	It is impressive.

Michael is being treated unfairly. He didn't go and murder someone|`|AA11835015	well, he was not too clever to ADMIT he was smoking pot. i could take a marlboro, dump half the tobacco, point the ends and make a "cool" picture. it would be up to the court to prove it was drugs i had. i think it is a waste of time to persecute (sic) him. i am not a fan of usa olympics, i favor the russian teams. BUT he should not get any punishment unless he was doping for performance enhancement. pot, alcohol, it all should be legal.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	It is not at all unfair.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	First of all, the NHL has NOT been talking about dissolving teams (hence this morning's lawsuit against the SunMedia corporation for the story they did on the NHL in turmoil).    As I've stated before, the cost of contracting a team is $10-$12MM/owner.  There are several owners who can't afford to do that or in the case of Calgary, Toronto, Philadelphia, and Boston refuse to spend any more of their money|`|G33E41IBaa	Ilya Kovalchuk  Mark Streit  Shea Weber  Shane Doan    Streit and Weber would really help the Devils defense, and Kovalchuk would add fire power.|`|FCXzgwC7aa	I am a Flyers fan but I really don't think that we would really need any of those players|`|3ULjjUNlaa	I'm a fan of Peter Mueller's, I wouldn't mind him on the Wings, or Shane Doan, or get Joey MacDonald back.  Bryan Little would be cool to have also.    Wings already got a lot of depth though.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	As a Red Wings fan, I honestly wouldn't like to see many of those players on our team.

There has been some talk about moving to Kansas City, since there is this Lighthouse project that Charles Wang wants to build, and Nassau County isn't approving it, blah blah blah.    If they were to dissolve some teams, I think the Islanders would probably be on that list.  They haven't been profitable in years.|`|m6lDXAmoaa	As a Wings fan, I would want to bring in   -- Shane Doan -- Defensive minded forward who can score. Would fit well on a line with Datsyuk and Zetterberg  -- Slava Kozlov -- I love Slava. HAving another Russian on the team who could actually teach Datsyuk how to speak English would be an added bonus  -- Jason Arnott -- Big body, losing some of his scoring touch but can still bring a decent amount of points and leadership into the club  -- Ed Jovanovski -- A solid defenseman who can bring in a good amount of points and can put in a few years for when (God Forbid) Lidstrom retires  -- Dan Ellis -- I just had to pick a fifth. Great young goalie    Thrashers for sure, Predators would probably go too.

RcxQKft3aa	They were talking about this on ESPN radio this morning (the rumor was started by Marc Stein), supposedly no deal has really even been proposed yet, but the possibility of Stoudemire being traded is very high and would include Tyrus, Thabo, etc.  I think its a great deal but it would make more sense if Larry Hughes was somehow included this, otherwise we may never be able to trade him before the deadline.... I also have a mancrush on Kirk Hinrich so I really hope he doesn't get traded.|`|aOcPe5e2aa	hel* no ......... this is the stupied trade no way the  suns cant give away amare and barbosa for  Kirk Hinrich, Drew Gooden, Tyrus Thomas, Thabo Sefolosha  they would suck! if the did trade them|`|IHZwUDtqaa	thats a pretty good trade it would help out both teams|`|AA11488609	Possible, but I want the Wizards to go for Stoudemire.

It happens only if Luol Deng is included in the package - Ben Gordon may be fine but Bulls should be pushing hard on adding Larry Hughes in the package which hinders the trade talk.     Indeed Knicks seems to be the favourite. Take a look on the following possible scenario:    http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...    Okay absorbing Eddy Curry is fairly risky, but assuming that Shaq's high praise on Suns medical staff applies and this is not a bad deal, not to mention his shorter contract.     I also see Hawks as a darkhorse:    http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...    The key of Hawks sacrificing Al Horford by now is that they need big man and scoring help, and both Amare and Barbosa help. A long shot of this is Hawks intention to push a playoff run in the East.
kqP7GwOcaa	Floyd Mayweather is a "Great" fighter, not because Floyd retired unbeaten, but because he beat a slew of great fighters among his 39 wins.  Joe Calzaghe is a good fighter, because he beat Kessler and and a couple of past their prime greats before he retired unbeaten.    I would not consider Trever Berbick great because he beat Muhammad Ali, which is a pretty decent parallel to the Calzaghe/Jones fight.  When Frazier beat Ali both Frazier in winning and Ali in losing the WAY they did it reached true "Greatness".    Joe's timing was off, he should have fought Jones and Hopkins ten years earlier if he was concerned about his historical legacy, and maybe even considered a couple other name opponents of decent quality back then as well.  As is was, your answer is no, Joe doesn't get a pass.  Both he and Floyd might make it to the hall of fame, but truth be told Joe Calzaghe was mediocre by most standards of historical measure.  That said, there are a lot of "mediocre" or "questionable" fighters inducted into the boxing hall of fame, and it's almost a given Calzaghe will get his plaque as well when time allows it, he certainly gave Britain and British boxing a bright spot.    I think you do Joe Calzaghe a great honor just mentioning him in the same sentence with Floyd Mayweather, Floyd was a far better fighter than Joe.  Floyd took risks, and fought A level competition, Joe beat has beens and never was's 46 times, and quit before he took on a real threat.  That is not how I define "Greatness".|`|ElH6jMEXaa	Nearly every champion who leaves gets the immediate scathing from fans because they stopped defending their title, not to move and take on new challenges but simply retired while their skills seemed to still be in tact.      It will eventually fade (like it did for Marciano) and that portion of their career is only a part of their legacy.  It is tough because in boxing there is a thin line where fans call for guys to press on and keep fighting and when they claim you've had enough.      With Floyd and Calzaghe there is a level of frustration because they appear to be leaving, in large part, to preserve an undefeated record.  Doing that while still appearing to be able and while there are a number of legitimate contenders leaves a sour taste - boxing isn't baseball, and real fans of the sport appreciate much less the idea of hanging your hat on numbers rather than trying to take on everyone available to prove your greatness.     Remember you could have also watched Sven Ottke, he didn't lose either - are you excited about that?  Ricardo Lopez never lost a fight, but when he left no one was complaining because he fought until there wasn't really anyone left for him to beat.|`|3M6wRYAoaa	im a welshman and although im a loyal fan of joe and boxing he should of fought dawson before he retired i dont think he should give carl froch the time of day. froch has done nothing to deserve the respect of joe he only won the wbo belt a couple of months ago i will give him a pass but only coz im welsh|`|LanxzmVdaa	You are so right Joe & Floyd were to of the greatest boxers of out time.  Yes they should both get a pass.  They both know when it is time to retire.|`|WdAwt7Dvaa	I was sad to here today Joe calling time on his career (what a career it was) the guy oozed quality. Ever since becoming the first person to win 3 ABA consecutive titles in 65 years the man just did not look back. I would have liked him shut that big mouth Carl Froch up , but that was never going to happen. As for Mayweather, maybe he will come out of retirement for one more fight against Hatton or Pacquio?|`|92QJW35daa	I`m sure Calzaghe would of had no problem exposing Pavlik as one dimensional had Hopkins not done it prior. As to Dawson when your life and death with a old Glen Johnson it doesn`t bode well at defeating a man of Joe`s caliber. Mayweather had one great performance against Corrales. Oscar was one fight away from being completely gone as a fighter. Hatton was a junior welterweight and Mayweather ducked every young fighter in his division never unifying anything it. Blogbaba your once again full of crap Mayweather doesn`t belong in the same sentence with Calzaghe. Still espousing the praises of the overblown Jack Johnson the killer of the weakest heavyweight division in history. The greatest who lost to Marvin Hart. HAHAHA|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	He shouldnt but i guess since he is a lot closer to 40 years old and has 7 or 8 more fights on his record than floyd people give him one. I agree with pretty much everything blog said ... mayweather is great even though he retired way too early .. he fought world class competition even if he ducked a few here and there. Joe did not fight world class competition he fought a lot of nobodies and didnt ever seek out great fighters or go to war with anyone in the ring , he is not a risk taker at all. His record is padded. I will say Joe has talent and was a good fighter thats all no more no less , by no means he was not great and certainly not a legend lets just leave it at that.|`|6QhACK70aa	my friend ,both  joe and floyd are great fighters  they won in 46 and 39 fights and had no loss!  to me that is greatness!  we finally agree in something!|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I wanted mayweather to keep fighting. He was not that old. But he deserves his props for being the undefeated P4P without a loss.

73nTYgdraa	Because it's entertainment, fighting entertainment.  Not all people would enjoy the Rio Heroes kind of entertainment, but they'd still like fighting, martial arts and just simply watch it for entertainment.    It's also child friendly. Parents, or most at least don't really mind letting their children watch it because they know that it's fake and their children, at least most kids know it fake.

My friends stopped watching but there was nothing else on TV that somewhat interested me. At the time I only had whatever tv you get with good ol' rabbit ears. So I saw SmackDown for a couple of years. Then I moved and met some more people that still saw it and made some friends that way. I would go to the shows and then my dad started to like it once Mysterio came out. So now I still like to sit down and see it whenever I get the chance, once a week, with my dad. Nice to have a beer and watch women go at it once in a while.|`|poQmOZb1aa	I watch it in hopes that a storyline will catch my attention.  While the outcomes are pre-determined, some of the physical damage they take is pretty harsh.  Like Mick Foley getting thrown off the top of a cage...how do you exactly prepare your body for that?  I remember the first time I saw RVD go coast to coast.  I literally jumped up and screamed.      We know wrestling is fake, but what about other sports?  Are those pre-determined as well?  Look at Super Bowl XLIII.  That might have been an incomplete pass on the last play but the referees deemed it a fumble...so be it.  But having the Steelers win the Super Bowl would be better for the league than the Cardinals.  We saw 10 minutes of replays for the Holmes touchdown but only one for the fumble?      Pittsburgh also benefited from a bad call in SB XL (Roethlisberger still hasn't crossed the goal line), a bad call vs the Ravens this year (the ball must break the plane, not the feet), and now this.  Hmmmmmmmmmmm
3DnX9NmAaa	The one martial art that works the best for me is Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu. I also love Judo. I've trained in Tae Kwon Do Chung Do Kwan, BJJ with the police dept., and short periods of time in various other martial arts.    As any good martial artist knows, there is no best martial art. It all depends on the individual.|`|dFAbkSWkaa	Brazilian Jui jitsu or boxing|`|uToFh7Beaa	I'm partial to Okinawan karate, but have been known to pull techniques from other arts, such as Kung-fu.

They all have strengths and weaknesses.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	OK, you said you wanted to know what works in real life situations.  But then you said, don't mention UFC.  Just how much real life fighting do you think anyone has done?  I mean, we're not drunken hooligans picking fights every weekend in bars.  Anyway, that's no way to test the validity of your martial art.      I think UFC has taught us a lot.  Basically that grappling is very important.  More important than most people thought before UFC came around.      But UFC is deficient in one thing:  what to do in mugging situations and when to run away.  I mean, if somebody is coming at me full bore, I'm going to knock his legs out from under him and run away.  Probably in a painful way.  This isn't the Wild West, and I'm not having grudge matches in the street at noon.      Mugging is the same way.  As long as the mugger (who is probably pointing a gun at me or a loved one) threatens to kill me, I just cooperate and get it over with.  Once he manhandles me, it's time to grapple, and the gun is way less important.  And still, my goal is to hurt him quickly, and run.      These are all theoretical because neither of these has happened to me.  I don't fight people outside of the dojo.      That said, I can tell you from personal experience, that in my judo dojo, they now learn greek wrestling as well as judo grappling because EVERY GUY who ever came to us with wrestling knowledge kicked our lilly white butts for over a year.   Sometimes including the teacher.  Great school.  Wish I could be nearby to attend it.    I also think that you have to respect the school that has the most well-known students in the community.  For example, where I live, many police officers are members at the local Brazilian Jujitsu School.  If it wasn't effective, they'd go somewhere else.  I recommend you find the local police officers and security people and find out where they train.  If they all or mostly all say the same style or the same school, you know that's a winner because they really are fighting in real life - unlike almost everybody else in the real world.|`|4WKLyUsraa	I am a Black Belt rank in Kodenkan Jujitsu.  I also trained in Kenpo Karate.  I loved the training involvement.  Since my training days, I have taught private lessons and also at BYU Hawaii at what I called Self Defense.  My opinion is to teach mainly very practical, simple offense as the best defense.  Techniques that are easily learned & practical.  I am in my 82nd year, and would rather avoid confrontation by using kindness whenever possible.  I believe it is better to use avoidance techniques than physical tech's.  If confronted with physical abuse, you must use what it takes to STOP the Aggressor, by using the least damaging response with DECISIVENESS (NO DILLY-DALLYING) NO PONDERING.  YOU MAY USE ONLY SUFFICIENT FORCE & VIOLENCE TO PREVENT AN ATTACKER FROM INFLICTING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH UPON YOU OR ANY INNOCENT PERSON.  I base my teaching on the "Principles of Self Defense" as taught by Jeff Cooper in his book "Principles of Self Defense".   We must keep in mind that what ever the outcome, we will have to justify our actions possibly in a court of law.|`|IgOw9wcXaa	jeet kune do or krav maga if you are the finnicky type who likes to learn one art form.

I should say I have not been in Tae Kwon Do for some time. How ever it is still my base art and use the techniques and Philosophies my instructors taught me to this day.    Edit: What do you study?|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	I primarily have studied Goju Ryu Karate, Judo and American Kenpo and feel these, out the many arts I have studied over 31 years, are the most practical for me since I have used them to save my life twice. In reality though it matters on the following:    1. How good the person is trained (Hence forth a good instructor).  2. If the person can learn to respond to attacks quickly and effectively.  3. If they are truly trained or just another two night a weeker at their local fitness based martial arts class.  4. If they have practiced in a live training environment where the other person is actually resisting their defensive techniques.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Hmm I wonder why these other posts are all different..  The reason is because the people themselves are different. They don't all do the same martial art, nor are they the best at each other's arts.  The art that works best in a real life situation is one that fits the one using it best. I am tall and pretty skinny, I am not so good at BJJ so that wouldn't work for me. I do study Kyokushin, that does work for me. Am i a bad martial artist because I don't study BJJ? No, nor am I inferior in any way. Am I a better martial artist because I study Kyokushin? No, nor am I superior in any way.  It's all what is best for an individual, different arts are better for different people. None is best. Martial arts are not for you to compare yourself to other people, they are for you to compare yourself to yourself (what you were to what you have made yourself through training). So if you can't compare to other people, how can you compare to their art? You can't.

DEDmq2OWaa	Nadal just took the AO- so I think the FO and Wimbledon will have an effect- Nadal takes it if he is healthy- Roger- it's all mental.    Give Tsonga advantage here.    Can we have a better choice? Oh well, Djokovic!    Simon- I want to see Blake but his results on Grass.. Hmmm    Del Potro- had a good summer last year|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Nadal because he already did it.

At the US Open Rafa usually appears sluggish and tired from his long season, which is why I think Roger would win against him this time.    Tsonga vs Verdasco (grass) (Wimbledon) - As of now Verdasco has the better game as seen in his win over Tsonga at the Australian Open, and they have both had equal success on grass, so as of now I would give it to Verdasco.    Djokovic vs Murray (clay) (Roland Garros) - Djokovic, Murray hasn't had much success on clay still, and Djokovic has been to the semis of Roland Garros and won several clay tournaments, as well as pushing Nadal pretty hard when they play on clay even in the best of 5 setters.    Blake vs Simon (grass) (Wimbledon) - Simon's counterpunch game won't be effective on the quick and low grounds of Wimbledon.  Blake on the other hand with has fast ground strokes will have the advantage from start to finish.    Del Potro vs Berdych (hard) (Australian Open/US Open) - probably Del Potro at both, he has been on a nice jump up the rankings with several titles.  With Berdych at his best it would be interesting, but I would still give it to Del Potro who has more confidence in his game, and a better ranking to show for it.|`|4dSSslHEaa	Nadal - just beaten the Fed on hard.  Roger's only chance is on grass!!    Verdasco - Australian Open is the start of something big for him    Djokovic - Murray's a whimp    Simon - Gilles is a heaps better player than Blake. Go SIMON!!  (i'm a bit bias)    Del Potro - just because|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Nadal  Verdasco  Djokovic  Simon  Berdych|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Rafa won in Melbourne, obviously, but as for the US Open it's really a toss...the ball moves quicker and Fed will want to either equal or break Sampras' record (depending on how Wimbledon goes), but Rafa will want his first Career Grand Slam BAD!  Verdasco  Djokovic  Simon  del Potro|`|1mKJFfieaa	Hmmm    Federer def Nadal  Tsonga!!!def Verdasco  Djokovic def Murray  Simon def Blake  Del potro def Berdych!!    =)    Tsonga Fan!!!|`|vYEEiWVBaa	Well Nadal just beat Federer on hard and I think he can do it consistently so I'll go with Nadal over Federer    Verdasco over Tsonga. I'm not sold on Tsonga. Other than his Australian Open run last season I haven't seen anything too impressive that makes me think he should stay in the top 10    Murray over Djokovic just because I think Murray is the better player and the rankings will show that late in the season probably.    Blake beats Simon. Blake is fast and athletic. Plus one of my favorites so I'm a little bias on this one    Del Potro over Berdych: This one is tough because I watched Berdych almost take down Federer in the Australian open and he looked really great on hard court. But Del Potro is simply the better, more well rounded player

Micheal Phelps is a great athlete, that's why we sent him to the Olympics!  Smoking pot is not morally wrong!!!  It's against the law, so is "speeding".  If you smoke pot...you broke a law.  If you speed, you broke a law.  If you don't carry your drivers license, you broke a law.  If you drink before 18 or 21, you broke a law.  If you don't pay taxes on grass cutting money...you broke a law. As President Obama said when asked if he smoked pot and inhaled, "isn't that the point".  MOST of our FUTURE Leaders and citizens will have smoked pot in their youth...IT should not BRAND you as a criminal!!!!!   THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS!!!   Get a grip people, there are fine people in this country who have smoked pot or presently smoke pot.  These people are doctors, lawyers, military men and women, christians, muslims, grandparents, teachers, students, olympians, professional athletes, collegiate athletes, neighbors, family, aunts, uncles, Presidents!!!!, Senators, Representatives, Mothers, Fathers, Sisters, Brothers and every other walk of life.  It's as common as drinking beer or wine.  Get a grip public and consider changing this completely FOOLISH Law.  Michael Phelps is a fine young man and an awesome representative of this great country.

QPZrnwP3aa	The 7 %  A holy man was having a conversation with the Lord one day and said, Lord, I would like to know what Heaven and Hell are like. The Lord led the holy man to two doors. He opened one of the doors and the holy man looked in.  In the middle of the room was a large round table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew, which smelled delicious and made the holy mans mouth water. The people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to be famished.  They were holding spoons with very long handles that were strapped to their arms and each found it possible to reach into the pot of stew and take a spoonful. But because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the spoons back into their mouths.     The holy man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering. The Lord said, You have seen Hell.   They went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as the first one. There was the large round table with the large pot of stew which made the holy mans mouth water. The people were equipped with the same long-handled spoons, but here the people were well nourished and plump, laughing and talking. The holy man said, I dont understand.  It is simple, said the Lord. It requires but one skill. You see, they have learned to feed each other while the greedy think only of themselves.

At 17 I don't know that you will get any taller so the 230 would fit you fine, it is much shorter than the 250 though. It really comes down to budget and what type of rider you are. The 250 is about twice the price of the 230, $6549 versus $3699 retail. The 250R is a motocross racing bike and the 230 is just a casual trail bike. If you ever plan to do any motocross riding at all the 230 will not do. It's suspension will not handle any real jumping and it is heavy. Also the 230 has no kick starter, bad decision on Honda's part. If you happen to drop the 230 in the woods and flood it with no hill to do a rolling start you could be stranded. It does not take too many cranks to run that little battery down. If you will just ride casual trails and don't mind not having a kick start the 230F is a great value and a fun little bike, but the 250R is just incredible. It's like comparing a Ferrari to a Kia. If you can afford a 250 and plan to do serious trail riding and even a little MX the CRF250X is an excellent choice also, just the woods racing version of the R.|`|39j4ON6Zaa	DONT get the 230F, its slow and not a bike to "grow into". for your height and size ide say go for the CRF250R, you wont regret it. it will have plenty of power to keep you happy for years.|`|PvV0aNvfaa	i think u should start off on a CR500, if u can ride that u can ride anything

AA12034449	I dont know...but today on this forum we found out that you may:    agitate a T rex to the point your weapon may kill him as it passes along with your body through the terrible lizards bowel tract.    There is a Army Scout sniper who cant bust clay pigeons... he might be able to kill you with that airsoft... he says he is a superior marksman.    Kid...airsoft or not...the safety is between your ears. Dont point aim at or shoot anything you are not willing to destroy. Wear the correct safety stuff if you are gonna play the game.|`|QvcJVoE2aa	hahah no dont get metal bullets. just chill|`|UefCjbvOaa	If you hit someone in the eye it could make em blind. But i get shot with them all the time. But iv never been shot right on the head. Any other part of the body like back and arms does harm that much, its just a little shock|`|p7xOo5Hyaa	YES, a man in Australia was shooting cans in his backyard and a pellet or bullet of whatever it was from his air rifle, missed the can, went through the fence of the neighbours and hit a 3 year old girl in the head who was playing in her sandpit.  She died. True Story!|`|fUDlbOP0aa	an airsoft gun can kill someone, but its not the individual BBs that kill, its when you shoot someone to death with sheer volume of plastic BBs. Like 10,000 times in one minute.     Normally, airsoft guns are very hazardous to the eyes and sensitive skin parts. It also hurts a lot and may result in some bleeding from broken skin from getting shot.|`|DNknBxRWaa	Maybe if you shoot them in the eye.     I got one they just hurt like hell when you get hit|`|MXAZ7Vohaa	yes depending on the location of the shot|`|UTFkHBkfaa	nnnooooooooooooo dude paintball hurts more than airsoft i got hit a few times by a paintball gun a few times|`|EUdHcGW1aa	It's highly doubtful they could kill a person.

The projectile causes damage to a target not the weapon that fires it.  A lowly .22 can drop a black bear, deer, hog etc *if loaded with the right ammo*.    Yes, you can load particular types of ammo that will kill when fired from an airsoft weapon....but you won't be doing that by accident.  As long as you stick to store-bought airsoft pellets in an unmodified gun, you're fine.  Wear your goggles and a thick shirt and have fun.|`|ff56RcYVaa	You can kill someone with a pencil, maybe you shouldn't buy those either.|`|HqS6TiiQaa	Airsoft guns require responsibility. Some people choose to use airsoft guns in a negligent and even criminal manner. Please read about Airsoft Gun Safety to learn about how to properly handle and use airsoft guns. Misuse of airsoft guns can result in prison time or even death and thus must be used with the highest level of responsibility    yes if you hit them in the eye or the temple, but thats why people wear face masks and equipment while using them.|`|MzCL0dzjaa	absolutely not. NOT EVEN IF YOU HIT THEM IN THE EYE THESE PEOPLE ARE DUMB|`|64pbFUreaa	Ya.  If You Shoot In The Eye.|`|ytl2PONXaa	Yes, you can kill somebody with a BB gun too.    I know... I was shot with a BB gun when I was 5 and my doctor said (or at least my mom told me later in life) that if the BB had gone farther down my face (I was shot in the cheek) that it would have entered my mouth and could have punctured my esophagus.     So yes, you could kill somebody with it if you aim correctly.|`|kNTP6HWbaa	if you put it on full auto and shot somebody like 80 times in the eyes then if might kill then eventually. Don't worry about it, airsoft guns are hardly dangerous as long as everybody is wearing goggles.|`|LaUouVtfaa	Uh, you can't really kill someone with it.. unless.. well, no. They can be dangerous like you can shoot your eye out, but they can't kill people unless you are REALLY REALLY trying.|`|EGgs5YsNaa	it is all on the power of the gun and range if it is long range stay at least 6-10 ft away if it is a it is a weak pistol stay 1-2ft away if it is a deasert Eagle stay 4-6ft away /if you need info you know how i am|`|iKsdhcSmaa	Maybe if you whacked them in the head enough times with the gun itself, otheriwse, no.|`|d60c982674e722b6bfead0e414d1d90daa	if you beat them to death with the stock|`|QrjuueMCaa	A glass of water could kill someone.

kYBlgFQAaa	Yes    College and HS:  55  NBA:  99    Like the other user explained, the referee needs to be able to relay a players number by using his/her hands, and the large majority of humans only have five fingers per hand.  The NBA doesn't adhere to this rule, presumably due to the high amount of retired numbers.|`|gsMjWUSvaa	no illegal number highest number 99|`|eF60R7DPaa	yes    highest   96    because the ref cannot do those Numbers with their hands when they are tellin the book who had a foul|`|U4Gnki1Gaa	there is a point at which you have to stop going higher in the  's  the last   you can use is 99 you can't have a triple digit   on your shirt because it can't fit on the shirt.

qGA7vXh2aa	It's a little bit less than 100 meters because of the handoff. It would probably equate to an 11.4 open 100. The straight would definitely helped a little. You would have also gone faster if you didn't run the first leg because you would have got a running start.|`|Rt6ajbqoaa	if depends on where you handed off, you could have ran less or even more very fast though|`|2qpzoNGpaa	Yeah u did run 100 meters, 11 seconds pretty god.  You might run maybe a 9-10 on a 100 meter sprint w/o the turns.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	Probably not, 11 is a very impressive time for a high school student.

AA10297143	Number one at what, swinging from vines?  As you can see fellow answerers, the Tarzan of Baseball must refer to Lou Gehrig, although it took a wee bit of research to come up with that and finding the link below.  So, with that said, Lou Gehrig was a good player, maybe even a great player, but he is better known for Lou Gehrig's disease than he is for his stats.  No, he is not a  1, nor is he NO  !,  He was good in his day.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Yes...Tarzan is indeed the gayest  1 fan...|`|zFlfIOQwaa	i dont understand this question at all. 'tarzan' 'no !'?????

X7Yt4qo3aa	No, it is everyone's fault.    You cannot blame 1 thing on 1 person if they play for a team. How many shots did Hamilton miss? If he made them they wouldv'e won. If Wallace got every rebound they wouldv'e won. If the staff and GM didn't trade Billups, they wouldv'e won.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Partly. But its the team that's losing alot of games and not being as impressive as they used to be. So maybe some fans gave up on them.|`|c65414e6d7b132c02e2235a82cf49555aa	No! the reason is the Pistons aren't looking good collectively! Iverson didn't make the team better, but I he didn't make the team worse!|`|9Injuk2zaa	yes
XwZZQbgCaa	Greg Popovich has a track record of limiting his veterans' minutes in the second half of the season, but it is the first time they rest the big 3 plus Finley at the same time.     Other than making his stars more refreshing, Spurs is probably the only team who won't mind to sacrifice a game or two for extensively playing its second unit, ensuring that the role players are physically and mentally ready to step up at any circumstance.     The loss to Nuggets is a fairly close game indeed, once again showing that Spurs remains the most possible option to beat Lakers in the West.|`|6VsjiOWKaa	The Spurs coach is smart for resting Parker, Duncan, and Ginobili.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	the spurs need to be able to step up  so far their only concerned with the playoffs  i think that they need to understand they need to be good in the season to be able to contend for a championship  im actually not surprised by this because that is greggs style with his veterans,he not gonna fight a fight thats out of reach  it honestly isnt a bad move by gregg,trying to keep his players fresh|`|IUxM3brbaa	Same way I feel about my grandma retiring from work.

30LMCJrAaa	He will get the average of the top five qbs in the league. Regardless of any trade, he is getting "much love"! But, the love will come from somewhere else because he is a hot commodity.    Look for him to be traded. New England will not let him sign with another team without getting the picks and a say in where he goes.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	If no one signs him the Patriots have to pay him more money then they do with Brady. 14.5 million I think for one year on the bench. Ouch|`|CTEQMXFwaa	He'll be rich for sure|`|yg3Pveakaa	I still think he will be traded, I believe his future will be on other teams not the Pats..O'Connell is the successor to Brady I believe they are grooming it that way..|`|tFEIa0aSaa	I think that he will be franchised and i think that the pay scale for that is the top 5 maybe 10 players at that position and you take the highest contracts and average it and thats what you get needless to say he will be a rich man

LhkjM9lHaa	- Out of those two, the A-5 will be faster (due to the Cyclone loading system) but thats about it. Both guns will shoot the same distance (especially if equipped with a Flatline Barrel) and both guns have the same accuracy. Honestly though, if you want the BEST woodsball gun on the market, I would go with the Tippmann X-7. Over 300 unique combinations and almost unlimited after-market parts make it the top of the line in woodsball.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	The Tippman is hard to beat for reliability and aftermarket accessories.|`|aRUEXTTtaa	i have a 98 but the A-5 is better and newer  get a response trigger and a longer barrel|`|qE49jbVaaa	the custom   i had it, it would just not break. the a5 is a nice gun but it breaks easily ---- we had 7 a5's when we were gonna play and 5 of them broke before se started  and they were new|`|RuJYupFWaa	Accuracy - same.  Only the barrel & paint quality makes the difference.  Distance - same.  No gun shoots farther than another when shooting the same velocity.    I'd vote for the A-5.  It comes stock with a cyclone feed so it's already got a speed advantage over the 98C.|`|GlJ20ljbaa	oh wow. here i go again. yes: tippmanns are the best woodsball guns ever. yes: the 98 custom is great. yes: the a5 is better. everybody knows this!!!! ok!? what you want is a Pro/Carbine!! Older, not produced anymore, but you can still get them. slower fire rate, but it shoots longer, straighter, much more accurately. best paintball gun ever made. get one! however, if your going to limit yourself to the 98c or the a5, go with a5.|`|2jdShi1saa	the a-5 is the new 98 custom, the a-5 is all around better, but make sure to get a flat line barrel.

The ball, when thrown, goes truer/straight when you do this.  Practice having someone throw a lob to you and then try to get it out of your glove quickly and gripping the ball with the 4 seams.  Dont throw the ball, just practice gripping it in this manner.  Do it over and over again and it will become automatic.  Trust me on this one!  2.  throwing... Make sure your elbow is about shoulder height when you are about to throw.  Your throwing hand should be level with your right ear.  Again, have some one lob a ball to you, practice your grip, then check your mechanics when you are about to throw.  Have a person stand about 10 to 15 feet away and throw it to them.  Remember, you are just practicing your mechanics.  Also, have a coach, friend watch where your elbow is in relationship to your shoulder, and, where your hand is in relationship to your right ear.  Make necessary corrections and practice, practice, practice.  3.  Throwing back to pitcher....once you have mastered the simple mechanics I mentioned above, now it is time to throw it to the pitcher.  I am assuming you know how to throw from a modified crouch, stepping with your left foot forward and pushing off your right foot as you throw the ball.  This forum is too limited to fully explaining the throwing mechanics.    Next, the ball should be thrown back to the pitcher shoulder high to his glove side.  Again, you can practice this by having someone stand 30 feet, 40-45 ft, until you can comfortably throw the ball the full 60 ft. 6 in.  Remember, look where you are throwing.  Again, look where you are throwing.  Dont throw it hard, just throw it!  It will work!  This is not magic, it just takes work and practice.  The more you do it, the more it becomes 2nd nature and your body will automatically respond to your throw.  Just liken it to shifting a stick shift.  Once you learn how, you never have to push in the clutch, you just do it automatically.  In closing, you just need to practice doing these things I have mentioned and start with small steps moving the distance a little bit more until you become comfortable when throwing back to the pitcher.  Your body will respond, your hand will find the 4 seam rotation grip and the throw will be on target most of the time.    Good luck!|`|Nmeoi5fBaa	ya know, there is not much anyone can help you with here. You will just have to not throw like that if it is messing up your arm.     Best of luck|`|0ff6026595b71e2fb6cc408869320d34aa	You need to take your mind off the problem. The more you think about it the more likely it will continue. It's probably mostly mental. You didn't say anything about having any physical problems with your arm or legs so it's probably just a mental block, and the more you dwell on it the more likely it will continue.      Of course you could also just memorize Playboy Playmate info and recite that while you throw, to distract you from thinking about the throw.    It worked for the catcher in Major League II.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Simple answer,  dont think about it.   I guess its almost a zen thing,  but if you dont think about being perfect,  you'll make the throw.    Just remember,   it doesnt have to be strong,  it just has to get there.   If your struggling,  take something off.|`|6T90F8mNaa	Haha! That reminds me of the movie Major League II. The catcher had the same problem.    Well, this is hard to help you with. Practice makes perfect, but really, the reason is you are thinking too much. Just relax out there, have fun. You are thinking about the expectations you have. Doing that will hurt you. Just relax and don't worry. That's all I can give you. As a college catcher, you know the basics.    You are thinking too much! Good luck playing!    EDIT: How to overcome it? That's hard. The problem is it's all in your head, you are the only one that can help yourself. Techniques can't help you too much. You just have to have fun, and relax. Maybe if you get to know your team better, they can support you. But this is hard to fix using techniques.|`|fLGaUVr0aa	clear your mind and don't think about how perfect you have to be   take a few days off and then get into a regular throwing routing like an infielder then slowly work into working on throwdowns and pitch returns    BEST OF LUCK|`|szkrumAJaa	Lob it back to him.  As far as throwing, aim for his head, it always worked for me.  Don't whip throw it like a pitcher, throw over hand like an outfielder|`|q4YGEjS4aa	I think you are your own problem.       As a long time pitcher and for the last two years the pitching coach for my local high school.  The only thing you should do is throw it back to their chest. Don't over think it.  It's like trying to think how to hit a curve as opposed to just seeing it and hitting it.  Your brain will try to make it more difficult than your instincts will.  If your playing in college, that tells me you have the instincts to do that.    I've always liked my catchers to throw it back to me pretty quickly.  I like a fast pace and I like my catchers to have a nice warm loose arm if any one is dumb enough to try and steal.  But I've never asked them to change their styles for me.  A good catcher will just learn he pitchin staff.  Like I'm sure your learning what they throw, how they throw each pitch, how fast the get ready between pitches.  You've got a lot of info on each whether you know it or not.     I dont' think you'll need extra practice time to get better.  If you're playin college ball I'm guessin even in the off season your getting plenty of reps in.  JUST RELAX.  You're playing college baseball.  Only like ten percent of high school players get to play college ball.  Enjoy it!

TGI53selaa	The problem with clear lenses is that they will not cut any glare. When sunlight hits snow the light is reflected off of the snow and into your eyes much stronger than on snowless ground. The use of a tinted lens will help cut this glare. However a lens that is tinted to dark will affect your depth perception and decrease your chances of seeing any hills or bumps in the snow ahead of you. I wold suggest the yellow or orange lenses as they will provide ample protection from glare while still saving your depth perception.    If it is any consolation I have been skiing for nearly 20 years and have found that orange tinted lenses are the best for cutting glare. I hope you enjoy your trip and that the goggles work for you. And also, do not simply relegate yourself to the bunny trail take a chance and maybe venture out, most ski resorts will have ample trails for beginning skiers that are plenty wide and have a perfect slope for beginners.    Good luck,    Alex-san|`|DhEZj9cKaa	I too would go for the yellow or orange lenses. They will cut out the glare/sun enough that you wont be squinting all day long.  And, they work great in low light situations (cloudy days, night skiing).
VWLtJoX2aa	You're right that hockey is a much faster paced game and you would burn more calories but you should do what you like better.  If you like to play soccer better you will burn more calories by spending extra time practicing/playing/having fun.  Too bad you can't do both.  Btw, are you a soccer goalie or player?|`|F934e4HQaa	HOCKEY NOT EVEN CLOSE|`|g2QUNwZzaa	umm, you burn WAY WAY WAY more calories running the field in soccer for 90 mins than u would standing in a net with heavy gear on for 60...    soccer stars make more money|`|4go3lFooaa	Follow your heart.

The thing u play with also goes 100 MPH and it hitting them right in the chest.  You need to be way more in shape because u r constantly falling up and down while soccer goalies just stand there and watch the whole game.  reaction time needs to be a lot greater as well.  Casey B is a goalie and he will say the same exact thing.

WpqwaqcQaa	Jan 8, 2008 12:44:24 AM  U.S. women's national team captain Kristine Lilly will not make the Olympics this year - and she has a good reason - the 36-year-old is expecting her first child.  Lilly will take the entire year off and commented on her impending pregnancy.    look for the Sports Illustrated magazine that ran an article this week titled "Mother Load," about women athletes on the United States Olympic team who are also mothers.|`|DLxh9CANaa	The most obvious historical record or story I can think of is that of Wilma Rudolph, who got pregnant and had a baby at 16, and then came back and won gold medals at the Olympics two years later, at 18. Other than that, I am not sure there are that many people who have gotten into this situation. The responder who mentioned the 36 year old athlete doesn't count- 36 is an adult, not a teenager.     Keep in mind as well that there are only a few sports in the entire Olympic Games which actually allow people under the age of 18 to compete, such as gymnastics, figure skating, swimming, athletics, and a few others. Most of the other major sports are for ADULTS only, such as the equestrian sports, for example, or things like cycling and rowing. The people who play on the basketball teams are adults, not kids, and the same is true for a long list of other sports. When an athlete is an adult, the rules which prohibit pregnancy in kids don't necessarily apply to them- and neither do the rules with regard to marriage or being in a committed relationship with someone else. That difference is what makes it possible for people like Karen and David O'Connor, the eventers, to compete on the same team while being married to one another. There have also been cases in which a parent and a grown child were together on the same team at the same time as well- and again, most of those have happened in the equestrian sports. This is not to say that there have not been adult female athletes who have competed while they were pregnant- in fact, there have been several of those, including a few from the US. But on the whole, there just have not been many young girls in that situation.|`|SKt1y1gzaa	i dont think theres any|`|EfaQpsd5aa	my moms best friend in high school went to the olympic trials in high jump and finished 1st, then she got pregnant. :/ thats all i got srry

Fb5YtlkEaa	Besides a trainer these are some things I would do:    -Using the chain lead put it through his mouth (like a bit) this usually sends a very clear message. The next harshest is putting the chain on the gums (which i do not recommend)    -Your afraid and so is your mother, realistically the horse will never change if you are afraid. And you have the right to be afraid. I would recommend talking to an experienced horse person and asking if they would walk him.    -Never whip a horse with a whip    -Rack him (using the chain over the nose or in mouth, NEVER when on the gum though, Yank down swiftly and quickly with about 2-3 lbs of pressure -You can press down or tap a closed fist down on a bathroom scale to get the feel) Do NOT just rack him once or twice you have to look for a change in his posture. He should back up, stop what he is doing, and may stand for a few seconds. He needs to know you are a boss and horse do this by force. A human a lone can not over power a horse but you can make him regret bullying you and convince him its not worth it.    -Never Rack a horse too hard, Racking should NOT hurt but rattle him a bit and cause him to stop.    -Of course this horse was a bargain, he is dangerous. Ask the former owner (which they will probably deny the severity but...) how they handled his fits and if it even helped.    Note this as a trainer I am appalled that your parents risk your safety with a KNOWN dangerous animal. The animal is also a liability. Hope and pray that horse doesn't injure anyone else or your 'bargain' horse may cost you everything you own. It happens. A LOT.      Bottom line, Try these things but your are going to get hurt with this horse badly if serious changes aren't made. I don't care how 'good' of a ride he is he is not worth your life or someone else's. He is not worth the danger and you will soon become soured to horse handling. I highly recommend selling or trading this horse for a more suitable one. This horse could be traded very very easily. Often times trainers are looking for good raw potential horses and have several horses that are finished. I would highly recommend this  so you still have a horse that is enjoyable and SAFE and this horse will be worked with and become safe.    again, if I was your mother that horse would be gone and you would have a safe horse that wouldn't risk your health. For your entire family's well being (psychically and monetarily) I would trade this horse.    Be safe and good luck|`|2c3NGrxHaa	Hello, Its so difficult when a horse acts this way, as of course horse will be stronger than any human leading him.    There is no point hitting him or telling off after he has run away as it has already been done and will definately not prevent him doin it again.     If my horse was doing this i would carry a crop and tap her with when i felt him gettin strong to remind him that i as the boss. and maybe get somone else to walk the otherside. As soon as he knows he cant get away with it, he will stop.    Good luck, and just dont put yourself in any danger with him  xxxx|`|GvoQxbipaa	His behaviour sounds appalling but he's probably never learned how to respect people and certainly has no respect for you now. He probably isn't 'bad', he just knows he can get away with things his own way. He is probably also confused because he receives different messages from different people.  Any severe gadgets, etc., will only make him more determined, and he will always win because obviously a horse is a lot stronger than any human.  I suggest you start him again from scratch doing in-hand work. He needs to learn to respect your space. Have a look at the Parelli seven games exercises:     www.naturalhorse.co.uk/training/index.... - 5k     There's quite a lot of other web sites on this.   Ideally an experienced trainer in Parelli or similar would be good. They are not always expensive (three years ago I had an amazing guy coming to work with my dysfunctional mare and he charged 15.- an hour), and just an hour a week might make a lot of difference. They could also give you some ideas of how to work with this horse safely yourself.  You say your horse is a really good riding horse, this is interesting because it means he DOES respect people as long as they are on his back, but somehow not when they are on the ground. But it means that he can work with you rather than against you if taught correctly.  He is probably quite intelligent and might even enjoy some of the Parelli work as a challenge!  I think it is good that you havn't given up on him and that you appreciate him as a horse.  But be safe, and good luck, it will be worth it in the end!
7b4f442c996b7e53df09d93cf060c43faa	It's not that bad, usually you have enough adrenaline going that you hardly notice.  It can hurt more or less depending on where you get hit.

It's like being pinched for about 2 seconds and when your in a game you don't think coz of the adrenaline rush. In some cases the ball might not explode which causes a rather painful sting. but if it does explode. You barely feel it. Also counts on how powerful the gun of which the paintball was shot out of is.|`|rWZ9wTCoaa	the first time you are hit it hurts but depends where it hits you if you are really skinny maybe a little bit more.

Neck, fingers and ribs are not good places to be hit in my experience, if you have heavy clothing on you might not feel anything, if you play without a shirt on it will probably sting a bit more. long range balls will sometimes hurt more than close range ones, because a long shot wont break and you take the full hit, where as close range its almost guaranteed to break on impact  basically every time you get shot it could feel different, sometimes you wont notice at all, sometimes it will hurt a bit, but it isnt that bad.    P.S. if the guy shooting you cranks his gun up higher than 250-300 fps you will feel the difference, ive seen a paintball put a hole in a hopper|`|Szf3UEVNaa	listen bare skin it can KILL you if it misses padding, it will leave a huge welt for a week or 2 if you get hit on padding it will hurt for a minute but you can  bare it but if your scared of being hit, you still need to try paintball its cool, if not that try airsoft.

xhPKkkELaa	I think you will want someplace else to surf! Even the Gulf of Mexico has you poor lake denizens beat. If you have never "surfed" before, don't get too excited about surfing in any of the great lakes. And yes, I have seen the You Tube videos of some frozen guys struggling to ride on one of the two or three days a year when you get ride-able waves.  http://www.surfline.com/travel/surfmaps/...   Read the linked article, and see what you think.    Now, as for the board, this question comes up a lot on YA Surfing, and it is impossible to answer it accurately on-line. Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop and discuss your skill level, your size and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. You should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.    And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment.    Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.    http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:  http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...  http://360guide.info/surfing/surfboard-t...  http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...  http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...
fi9XDvLiaa	Don't listen to JB, he's just spewing the same generic **** he'll give to anyone asking for food advice, regardless of their situation.  If you're only going up and down a mountain in less than three days, then yea, the generic staples will work since your body has not switched over to high-intake mode.    DO NOT BRING CAFFEINE.  It messes with your core temperature  DO NOT BRING SUGARS.  Same reason  The more freeze-dried meals you carry, the more fuel needed to melt snow.  Alternatively, the more water you have to carry... which is one reason serious mountaineers don't carry more water than a quart or two in thermoses... freezing issues and weight.  Wait for rest stops to boil water to drink, drink all you can (superhydrate), and save only a quart or so until the next time.    Look for a daily ratio of 20% carbs : 40% fat : 40% protein on 7 day+ trips.      Carbs:  Bannock/Hardtack is a staple.  100% flour in a rock-hard brick of nonperishable goodness.  Make your own - cheap, easy.  Oatmeal in the morning.    Protein:  dried, smoked salmon.  Peanuts/GORP.  Pemmican is another staple that goes hand-in-hand with hardtack.  a 50/50 ratio of fat to protein, cut into 10oz bricks, will meet all your requirements.  Powdered milk on oatmeal.    Fat:  unsalted butter, saltpork, pemmican (see above)    Here's a simple, non-perishable and lightweight, high-energy, low-bulk meal plan that has been a standard since the 1800s:    Breakfast: rolled oats with melted butter  Lunch:  gorp and salmon (no need to cook), just walk and eat  Dinner:  warmed pemmican, softened hardtack in hot water|`|2TB8p5fvaa	Freeze dried pot stickers.|`|XJSOToRGaa	How long an expedition and what temperature mountains???    If we're talking about a hill in the middle of New Jersey, a box of protein bars will do ya.

Freeze-dried food designed for backpacking trips is available in endless varieties, including desserts. Some of it is better than others; we prefer Mountain House brand, which is available at most outdoor stores, but generally not at grocery stores. However, such custom foods are expensive; you can make your own with an inexpensive dehydrator or shop the regular grocery store and find good substitutes. Heres some grocery suggestions:  Oatmeal might just be king of the trail  its good for you, easy to prepare, and lightweight. For best results, put individual servings into baggies. Add desired amount of sugar, cinnamon etc to each bag. Same goes for instant hot cereals, mashed potatos, rice and other inexpensive dehydrated foods like couscous, instant grits, Chinese noodles, hash browns, refried beans, and chili. Visit your local food co-op or health store and browse in their bulk section for a good selection - you can buy as much or as little as you want.   Check out the cooking times for anything you bring. Some packaged products require more than 20 minutes; stick to preparation times of 10 minutes or less to cut down on fuel usage and hassle.   Make your own trail mix (aka GORP- Good Old Raisins and Peanuts) with M&Ms, mixed nuts and raisins. Separate into a daily allotment in baggies so you dont overeat on it during any single day. Its great stuff, but real boring by day 3 or 4. So mix it up with some pretzels, other nuts, crackers, sesame sticks, malt balls, dried fruit, cheese, etc for longer trips.   For a warming breakfast, take along a few flow-through coffee and tea bags, instant coffee packets, spiced cider packs or hot chocolate.   You have lots of powdered soup options to choose from  dump the containers and repackage in baggies.   Look for tuna fish in foil pouches. The packets cost more, but weigh less than a can.   Bread is OK for a few days, but prone to crushing. Try tortillas instead.  Peanut butter is great on backpacking trips  take it out of the jar and put in a baggie. Cut one corner off so you can squeeze it onto your bread without using a knife, then store that cut bag into another baggie.   Some hard sausages and cheeses and pepproni will keep for several days on the trail; keep well-sealed in your pack and eat first.
kGRkjw6Qaa	I played against Rob Gronkowski in highschool. He is from Woodland Hills HS in Pittsburgh but transfer from a school in Buffalo. He has very large feet and arms =D    Their QB was Tuitama last year, I believe they won their bowl game, coach is a Stoop (Mike or Bob can't remember)....    They are usually known for upsets in November like last years Oregon upset and they are in Tuscon    I could go into the history, like when they had the Desert Swarm defense with Chris Mcallister and Scooter Sprout...they beat Nebraska that year in the Holiday Bowl|`|7mjc1kjdaa	I know what their uniforms look like and what conference they belong to. That is all.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Wildcat Formation?
4DcvpQXfaa	i guess YES    jordan his is a DOUBLE DOUBLE machine!|`|9195df8240d4ca7e9368c29574c37ad1aa	no.
wbIEau0qaa	no, howard yao and nelson are such concrete players right now. dont trade any of them. KG shows up some game but isnt as good as howard. AI shoots and gets points but nelson offsets that with assists and points. and yao gets more of evrything over barriani|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	don't do it|`|lPDHMOVZaa	No way! That's highway robbery!|`|d4VBWZf2aa	No do not do it. Dwight is a beast and Yao is very good when healthy...he gets you everything. Jameer just got injured but i dont think he'll be out a long time. Plus he's been heating up. For the other side of the deal. Bargiani is good but not that good. AI has been strugglin as has all the piston players. KG is sick (but i may be a little bias cuz im a boston fan, cuz i love ray allen) and chris kaman is hurt. So i wouldnt do that deal...keep your players|`|6b7067a3c0de0780910440c27ce24be0aa	Big no.  You gotta keep Howard and Yao, Bustani sucks, Kamen sucks with Zach Randolf on the team, and KG is not putting up good numbers with his stacked celtics team|`|c81b92ba388ed8f26a77d94a6d6a900baa	What is the benefit for your team?
LpR9sLSlaa	Their "pre season" practice is in Flagstaff  at NAU    Since 2006, their home games are in Glendale  just West of Phoenix.    In 1988, the Cardinals moved to Arizona, and the Phoenix Cardinals started playing home games in Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University (Tempe Az)    Construction of the new stadium, started in April 2003, in Glendale, one of the western suburbs of Phoenix. University of Phoenix Stadium features a retractable roof and a slide-out grass surface, which is good for the hot desert weather; the new stadium has a state-of-the-art air-conditioning system and high-back seats.|`|OFi3jBSHaa	That's Sun Devil Stadium, not ASU stadium.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	University of Phoenix Stadium theirs a reason for the Moving Field.|`|C7PcIZv9aa	Univ of Phoenix Stadium!!!|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	They have their own private training facility, but they play at University of Phoenix stadium which they built after moving from ASU Stadium
xbQZ6xXvaa	my guess is maybe because i have nba live and it gets updated everyday because i have like a program for that but if ncaa football didnt well actually madden didnt get updated that much either so my guess is yes maybe 1nce a week|`|HimBbU6caa	I have NCAA Football 09 and there were only 2 updates in the very beginning. I hate the football on the new gen systems. I don't have NCAA Basketball, but I heard there was some sort of bug with the rosters like there was in the football.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Sorry , but , the answer is , no .
d3f005ddefb1ad4a72c6901433c1c89daa	I cannot believe what has happened just because he smoked some pot.  OMG if that is the worse thing he does, more power to him.  He should be allowed to enjoy a moment, everybody else does.  And although Kellogg is pulling out as a sponsor, which is stupid, does not mean that I will quit buying Kellogg cereal.  How ridiculous can we get.  If I could still smoke pot and keep my job, I would do it tomorrow.|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	Well he sure does now. Stupid move on his part.|`|gfCeJArVaa	Yeah he actually kinda does. Maybe hes been doin drugs since a long time ago maybe|`|sJUCJO7Waa	Agreed.  He does look like a stoner especially on SNL.  He should be able to smoke all he wants after the way he trained.
Og4GBZBOaa	Ive been playing for 16 years and have coached for 3 of them. I am 21 years old and have a college championship as well. What I have seen and what helps me is plain and simple stuff, you need to have a good foundation before you can get better. You dont practice slam dunks before you learn to dribble. Get a ball find an open place with a big wall. Just kick the ball against it over and over. different speeds do passing and shooting, and never let the ball get past you. This will improve your ability to strike the ball and your first touch. The two most important things in the game. After you have done that for 300 hours or so, you should have a good foundation for being a great soccer player.|`|HYw0YE7Gaa	PRACTICE A LOT! i play soccer and i practice every day it reallly helps me improve! p.s. with two different teams|`|N0sbhRu6aa	Its true what Brit says. You need to be able to run. I am a great example, I have very good skills because I practice them a lot but I just realized why I get tired during games---I don't run! Start by running 2 miles a day and also you need to be able to eat 6-8 times a day carbohydrates and protein to support muscle and glycogens (which is very important). In terms of skills, the best to use is a big wall. Start by kicking the ball against the wall. Sometimes, its better to practice alone then practice with somebody but always find days to practice with somebody.    Watch Learn to play the brazilian way. This is the best set of videos showing you EXACTLY how to play like a brazilian. Your play will be very distinct.    Great exercises for football:    Pushups: You need to have an upper body strength for power such as explosive power. Remember, football is a contact sport too so when you have the ball, sometimes you need to be able to fight for the ball. The better your upper body is, the more defenders you can get past without actually fouling the player.    Crunches: Aside from running you need a strong core for endurance from running. You will get less tired and your body will also benefit from having strong abs because this will mean more power from kicking.    Squats. You need strong legs. Though, you will develop them naturally from the force of kicking and running but you also need to be a step ahead of your opponent. The only weight training exercise you need for football is to squat. Its how professional footballers get huge legs. Your arms and upper body will also naturally get bigger.      http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=GenC...    In terms of skills, you need to practice them every day. I suggest you work on your actual skills then your physical strength. That will come later|`|0F744yG0aa	Well im on my high school soccer team and I am 14 so maybe I can help.  First you can start training by running. You can have all the skills in the world but if you can run or charge all is lost. Try passing 2 touch with someone then try one touch. Work on chipping, shooting and most importantly, use the inside of your foot 85% of the time (except for shooting). If you need more help look on youtube for soccer training tips.|`|R3wag4pzaa	practice practice PRACTICE!!   run A LOT!!  it took me a loooong time to become pretty good at soccer. for additional help, you can watch some youtube vids on how to dribble and pass etc.    a tip on passing: look at the object your passing to (like a team mate or the goal) and point the foot that you are not using to shoot with in the direction of your target    these are pretty good  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uRIhNOWQ...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DIeV14cD...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hRbhncyu...
56917efc2d4323a083e26002e4c680fcaa	First of all don't listen to idiots like the last guy, I'm 6' 3'' and weigh 200lbs what you have to do is practice trying to do some kind of spin move while your moving the ball and get maybe 3 or 4 good running steps (if you know what I mean) before you try your jump.If you can't master that try faking whoever is covering you so you can be left alone to get a good running start. I used to play a lot of b ball. Being tall and lanky has its advantages. Main thing is to practice all you can and never give up. Happy jumping.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	6 inch stilletos! worked for me!|`|Ppb2l14vaa	get surgery and add springs inside ur knees|`|paCHaDWVaa	Growing 6 inches :))|`|wKNcNWD3aa	Perfect, and easy for you. You need to build your calves, and lower legs. What you need to do is jog as a base exercise. But on top of that, find a step or anything that you can hang your heals off of while you face the other way. Lower your heals as low as you can without falling off the step, and then push up on your tip-toes. This will work the muscle in the front of your shin, and your calves, Also add weight to build it big. You will add a good foot to your vertical. Also, work on your form for jumping. and then put it into action. Play ball as much as you can, and it will just happen. I promise.|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	Get your hamstrings and calves stronger. Walking around the house without shoes and on your tip toes will get you a free calf workout. For your hamstrings -- squat down and explode with a jump & try to land softly. Do ~7, rest, repeat 2 times.  Those exercises will get you ahead of the curve real quick.|`|F5GyrdQfaa	Train your lower body with lunges at about a 12 - 15 rep range, then put down the weights and jump as high as you can about 10 times. Rest 2 minutes, then repeat this set 3 times. This will help.      REMEMBER to land on the front of your feet! NOT flat-footed, or you'll feel it all the way in your shoulders.|`|HExhuoBbaa	calve raises with alot of weight will help 80 % of our jump hight comes from our calves just put your toes on the bottem step of a flight of stairs hold some weights in your hand and lift you body up and down you will feel it after about 5 enjoy!!!|`|mqGMkUXZaa	If you're that tall already, you will grow even more, that's a guarantee.  Hit the weights and build not only your legs, but upper body.  Upper body strength will help your jumping height more than just working the legs alone.   You will probably top out at about 6'3'' or 4''  or even 5'' I bet.  If you keep fit, there's no doubt you will be able to dunk.|`|S2gIzdg9aa	trust me work on your lower legs,get some leg weights.|`|EkxqbQTwaa	A trampoline.
hB0z1bBFaa	Matt Ryan has a good potential to be an all-star quarterback. I hope he makes it to the superbowl and win at least one. So, yeah, I think they will make it eventually, maybe not 2009-2010, but maybe later on after Ryan gets some more experience.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I think they won't make the playoffs.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	I don't know if they'll make it next season but we'll get there eventually. We need some work on defense to make a run for the super bowl.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	no|`|yg3Pveakaa	They can..But can you face the fact that can beat the big teams in the NFC like Giants, Eagles, Cards, and Dallas.. They have a bright future in Ryan, White, and Turner and having John Abraham also helps alot in D.|`|30LMCJrAaa	That team is being built the right way. The picks and free agent signings are working very well.    A few move awesome moves like the ones they have made lately and the Superbowl is not out of the question.    If I were a band-wagon guy, I would buy a Falcons hat....    but, I am loyal to my team of 30 years....    Good luck, the Atlanta fans deserve a team with rings!|`|J3kfQtViaa	I hope so.  Who knows!|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	no|`|dL5BXQu8aa	You never know, but nobody can tell right now.|`|CTEQMXFwaa	They'll play the 49ers in NFC Champ. ATL will win and play BAL.|`|tSDhcGOUaa	They have an opportunity like every other team did this year.  I'm a Cards/Raider fan so trust me anything can happen.
CXOs4mAEaa	Stay away from them    cheats NEVER prospur...
mgZiZF1vaa	I had the same thing when I was first learning flip tricks.. It is literally just a matter of patience and practice. When doing the kick flip try and jump so you hang in the air just enough for the flip to finish and level back out keep your feet out of the way and just practice you timing. Trust me stick with it, and you will have it in no time!     Also once you nail kick flips try not to forget your technique because you can pretty much apply the same technique for the majority of flip tricks!    Hope this helps a little, keep practicing and you'll nail it!!

He  broke the law; whether you and I agree that the law ought to be amended is immaterial.  And I'm sorry, but when you're granted the sort of status he was as a result of his unique abilities, you WILL be under the microscope every waking moment.  He knew that and still was immature enough to screw around.  He has nobody to blame but himself.|`|InCpu9Vfaa	pots illegal|`|sO1tkGunaa	I agree! Everybody makes mistakes, and I personally think that these people are taking this too seriously. Just because he got 8 gold medals, doesn't make him non-human. People need to get real...|`|eJrRals7aa	Although I love Micheal Phelps, I think he did something stupid and is very responsible for his actions.

It sucks that you have to deal with that crap when you suddenly become famous.|`|yeYL8Udoaa	lol who cares?????|`|A1kcSX3Zaa	I agree. He's a good kid with a great ability. Someone jealous trying to knock him down is all.|`|y9z65Rndaa	true but pot is illegal but i don't think that gives them the right to post the photo to the media in the first place|`|JWa78QVoaa	Pot=illegal  Alcohol=legal    To sum it up, pot and alcohol ARE different.  He is a gold medal winner and by proxy, a role model.  You'll understand why he should get hosed when you have kids, and if you are already a parent then let me go ahead and nominate you for your parent of the year award.  Congrats on being a dunderhead.|`|HimBbU6caa	I wonder if they caught Terrell Owens smoking a bong if people would be sympathetic of him. What about Manny Ramirez? God forbid lol. The golden boy gets caught with a bong now every body is crying and whining "Leave him alone!".

But look at this way his image is his job. The companies that sponsor him don't want to be associated with something illegal. He gets paid to be the "Olympic gold medalists", not the "Olympic Gold Medalists Stoner" if he doesn't want people knowing what he does on his own time he should to that behind lock doors and alone.    Would you get written up if your work had a random drug test and you tested positive.    Life isn't fair, give the government a few more years and they will figure out a way to legalize it.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	I am sure that the person passing on that photo received some personal gain.    Mr. Phelps is in the public eye. He placed himself there. He gets paid to be a spokesperson and to look innocent to the fans. This draws a lot of attention and revenue to both Mr. Phelps and Those who endorse him.    I do not condone his behavior. Yet, there is no one among us without fault. If he did not want to be subjected to this level of scrutiny, he should not have put himself in the place to get caught.    Next time, do it alone or Don't Do IT at All.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Well, I don't think his DUI was good for his image, either. This is what happens for public figures. You gotta watch yourself b/c everyone is on the look out to find a scandal and throw you under the bus for their 15 minutes of fame.    Phelps brought this on himself for talking about how much he enjoys being a role model. I think Tony Kornheiser said it best when he said that, "he's gotten very good at making these 'one time mistakes' and then aplogizing for it."|`|g7xaB57Xaa	The only question is this.  In his spare time, is he allowed to even have one alcohalic beverage?.....If the answer is yes, and he wouldn't lose any endorsements from doing so, then WHAT HAPPEN TO HIM WAS BULL**** BECAUSE ALCOHAL WAS AND STILL MOSTLY IS THE PERFERED DRUG OF THE OLDER GENERATIONS.  If the answer is no, and that goes for any drug, then what he did was just stupid.  Yes, you can argue that because its illegal, because hes a rolemodel, and because hes an athlete, it was stupid regardless.  But I hope whoever says otherwise hasn't had more than one alcohalic drink in his or her life, because if they do drink now and then and don't see the problem with casual Marijuana smoking still being illegal and discouraged harder than casual drinking, then they are drug enjoying HYPOCRITS!|`|AA11267705	He wrecked his own life; he did the wrong thing and contrary to popular belief not everybody will turn a blind eye to him.

0ff6026595b71e2fb6cc408869320d34aa	Going by your numbers there would be 40 players on the team.    No team actually has that many. Major League teams have 25 players on the active roster, about half being pitchers. They do have 40 man rosters but the remaining players are minor leaguers who get called up and sent back down throughout the season when someone on the 25 man roster is on the DL.    MLB rosters do expand in September, so a team can have up to 40 players on their active roster at that time.|`|XrCc85kNaa	It doesn't matter....

MMQ7SdvDaa	I've seen some online retail vendors who still have 7.62x39, but the fact is supply and demand is driving the prices up. Back in 1998 I was able to but it for 99.00/1000 for surplus and 130/1000 for 223 surplus .. I wish I had filled up a storage shed at that time. I would have been the only investment that made it through the 'recession' in tact and doing well.    Ammo is a tried and true currency, as the federal reserve devalues the dollar ammo prices will be more valuable..     Some Cabela, have the 200 round boxes, J&G Sales, Cheaper Than Dirt, Able Ammo. I am not sure about some of the others. You will pay a premium as long as we have such an anti-gun tyranny builder in the Whitehouse and with a complicit Congress all bets are off.     There is an older rule of thumb.. "Buy it cheap, bury it deep." Lesson learned. When the threat is off I will stock up... But this threat will exist as long as voters vote for the politician that will grant them favors on the dole.     "A democracy is always temporary in nature ; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship."  "The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years.   During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:  1. From bondage to spiritual faith;   2. From spiritual faith to great courage;   3. From courage to liberty;   4. From liberty to abundance;   5. From abundance to complacency;   6. From complacency to apathy;   7. From apathy to dependence;   8. From dependence back into bondage "|`|OEQAGJZZaa	In my neighbor's armory.  That guy has just about any type of ammunition possible.

Nahh........ not even if my cousin is the manager of the place......|`|fUDlbOP0aa	at everyone's but your house. We all stocked up to a ridiculous extent expecting a major gun ban and ammo taxes. I didn't really believe that Obama would do that as his first things as president, or first 100 days, But since everyone is doing it, I don't see why shouldn't I join in on that too.   And now after Obama took office apparently some people think that he ban will still come so they apparently was selfish and cleaned out all the local stores, leaving non for anyone else.    I have nearly 9000 rounds of 7.62x39mm at my house. Its definitely not the largest stash in my area since during the post election Nov. gunshow I saw some guy and his family go and buy an entire pallet except for two cases, which I bought. That pallet had easily 100 cases on it. 100,000 rounds- now that's stockpiling!    What I'm missing now is more money to buy even more ammo. everything is plentiful where I live, except handgun ammo for whatever reason. I got my 7.62x39, .223, 7.62x54r, .22LR, and 20 ga shells. i even have two cases of ammo I can't even use (found at home foreclosure garage sale): .308 and .30 carbine.

czNUMFdWaa	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE....Do NOT buy a ball from a retailer like Kmart, Walmart, Sportmart or any other "mart."  They are HACKS and could cause serious injury to your hand, wrist, or elbow.    Just about every bowling center out there these days has a pro shop located inside.  To be safe, go to an IBPSIA certified pro and they will be able to educate and advise you on the best route to take with your equipment.    You can check out www.pba.com and www.ibpsia.org too to find pro shops in your area.    Best of luck.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	none  you really have to go to a pro shop and most of them are located in a bowling alley  other than that you can purchase them on line|`|obPSaYf3aa	Only K-Mart, and they carry just regular, basic urethane bowling balls and plastic or polyester spare balls.  They do not carry high performance bowling balls at all.    I definitely have to agree 1000% with the certified USBC Coach because the bowling equipment at K-Mart is just for recreational use and not for bowlers seriously wanting to take the sport up.  The children's pre-drilled bowling balls are safe because they are the same used at some bowling centers as "house balls", but the "urethane" or "particle" bowling balls are just regular generic cored balls with the aforementioned coverstocks, and will not perform to yours or any knowledgeable bowler's liking.      If you're looking for quality bowling equipment, check bowling.com, bowlersparadise.com, bowlingball.com and bowlingballsales.com.  Your local pro shop will also be glad to assist you!

oMSTg5rQaa	Man the Spurs are not boring by any stretch of the imagination.    People just say that sh*t because they don't have flashy personalities, team fueds, or a marque player that has his own collection of shoe commercials.     The Spurs from a basketball stand point are beautiful to watch. They are balanced offensively, play top 3 defense in the league every year, and every one of those guys only play to win. They are all unselfish.    Look at Ginobli, an all-star caliber player, who can get to the rim just as good as Dwayne Wade, shoot the three, plays great defense (flopping included) yet HE COMES OFF THE BENCH! What other player in the league with that kind of talent (besides Barbosa or Gordon) willing comes off the bench?     What other guard can get to the rim and finish like Tony Parker? None! They guy for a couple years shot like 50-55% from the feild because he finishes in the lane so much! That's extremely unusual for a 6'2" 180 pound point guard.    Oh yeah, didn't even get to Tim Duncan yet. But we all know what Timmy is about. Automatic in the post and an anchor in the paint. Nothing flashy just results, like a true big should be. The dude spreads the wealth to his teammates, yet I bet he could still average 25 points a game if they needed him to.     The Spurs can grind it out for a 87-75 win, or they can run an up tempo team out of the gym. The Spurs can play any style.     So anyway, I'm rambling, but like I said, if the Spurs had a player that had Nike commercials running after every time out, or if Tim Duncan rapped about how David Robinson's @$$ tasted or how he couldn't win a title without him, or Tony Parker cheated on Eva Longoria for a Spurs cheerleader, then I bet the Spurs would be the "most fun" team in league.|`|AA11488609	they play mostly half court offense, and half court games are not really flashy.  The Spurs are also methodical, and players know their roles, day in and day out, even when injured.|`|u8GHTJEEaa	People call the Spurs boring because they play a team-oriented, defense first, grind it out style of basketball. The Spurs offense is predicated on patience, ball movement, and unselfishness. They are not flashy, they don't try to slam it down on every play, they're just as happy with a baseline jumper from Kurt Thomas as they are with a slam from Manu Ginobili. On defense they're just as happy forcing a 24 second violation as they are with getting a steal. When they block a shot, they don't swat it into the 12th row. The Spurs don't yell, pose, and prance after a big play. Even their superstars are low key. Tim Duncan would be deadly at poker. All you see from Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili is a smile. The most emotion you will ever see from the Spurs, aside from Tim Duncan's occasional fist pump is a high five or pat on the rump or the head. There are no chest bumps or forearm smashes here. All you'll see is a finger point at the person who made the big play and then it's back to work. The Spurs never get too high or too low. This all comes from Head Coach Gregg Popovich who always reminds them, "You're never as good as your last win, and you're never as bad as your last loss."|`|XrCc85kNaa	They are people who dont appreciate good basketball...  Ignore them...|`|m501HwyWaa	i wonnder how many people are on thier computer on yahoo answers ready to bash|`|9cub6mMQaa	Because most people would rather watch flash and flair than good, solid fundamental basketball. People think flash and flair is better, but what wins more games? Spurs basketball, of course.|`|Ltm9Svpsaa	probably because this so called boring basketball team has beat and ridiculed their flashy and more popular team and has showed them that you don't need all those dunks to be the best they're just hating these people who call the spurs boring are just mad and embarrassed  for their team who get all physical and still i say still cant beat the spurs with all the circus show they put on|`|IAnT8aGsaa	They are too textbook, and everyones tired of ginobli's flops|`|IUxM3brbaa	They are predictable every game.  Parker scurries in like a rat and when he gets boxed out he throws it out to a 3-pt corner shooter.  Duncan uses the backboard all day.  Ginobili is just a flop fest.    How is it not boring after a couple games?|`|BX0muv3raa	I don't know why people would call the Spurs boring this season, seeing that Manu and Tony have made ESPN's Top Ten Plays more than any other backcourt this season. But I guess this opinion has been formed since the Spurs don't have a star that can jump out of his shoes and throw it down hard every single game and they don't light up the score board with impressive numbers every night. What their style has brought them has been Four titles and an NBA record 7 straight seasons with 57+ win seasons and 9 straight 50+ win seasons, ten if you count the season before the lockout and most importantly, the NBA's highest winning percentage for the past decade. Not to mention, the HIGHEST WINNING PERCENTAGE OF ALL TEAMS IN ALL 4 MAJOR AMERICAN SPORT LEAGUES!     So its hard to argue that the best team in all of sports can really be boring. If it's boring and it makes you the best in everything for so long, why screw it up to be "exciting"?

obPSaYf3aa	Barry Bonds is intelligent, cool under pressure, but very sensible in his choice of answers to the public, which shows that he never had intentions to defraud the US Government by lying.  It's true that using any type of "performance enhancing" agent is bad, but maybe they're seeing that PED's and steroids do more harm than any good because they don't boost your performance up in baseball as people think they do.     Barry will definitely walk with a not guilty verdict or a full acquittal.|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Nobody will go to jail. They have lots of money. They're superhuman, unlike us. They don't need to folow the laws. The reason Bonds trainer went to jail and refused to talk is because barry paid him a lot of money to go to jail and not speak of him.

The Brewers should try & get another good Pitcher in the meantime.|`|iGYGJfgsaa	Arm surgery and he can wave a big contract goodbye|`|c6q3EERdaa	If it helps his career, he might as well do it. He's been a big question mark because of his injury history, and this only adds to it. Give 2010 a shot, and if he doesn't play well, he should hang 'em up.|`|omszEWSSaa	he will be signed by a team that needs to make it to the playoffs|`|XrCc85kNaa	I actually feel really sorry for him...  It is an awefull time for him to get a surgery...  He will be losing a lot of $$$$$$$$|`|gUMucKOkaa	He and his agent tried to get a contract without disclosing his injury which is stupid and unethical.    And he and his agent turned down arbitration knowing of the injury. Really stupid.    I have always liked him but this is ridiculous.    I think that he needs a new agent.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Sheets is a good pitcher who has never won more than 13 games in any season. His career record is 86-83 with an ERA of 3.72. He averages 178 innings per year. When I have seen him pitch he looks wonderful. He is always injured and is a major risk to any team that ventures to sign him.|`|n6oKAac1aa	Recovery time could be as much as 6 months.  He had a 2 -year agreement in principle with Texas until he failed the physical.  What this means is a veteran's minimum contract in 2010 for the team that wants to risk a roster spot for one of the most talented, albeit fragile arms in the game.  Milwaukee may still get him back next year.|`|mmbKlqLEaa	He will be signed by a team who is tying to make a playoff push|`|cM3jYmIYaa	The Crew would still get 5 picks. But it would cost the Crew money to pay for the surgery if Sheets doesn't sign with Texas before he has surgery. If he signs with the Rangers then has the surgery the Brewers are off the hook. But since he was with the Brewers when he suffered these injuries the Brewers have to pay for it unless he signs with the Rangers before the surgeries. But no loss of picks!
PPwfY6Cxaa	yes he is. he won 3 playoff gamnes as a rookie qb|`|AA10279105	well, he had a good year... why not?  put him in there.  he deserves it.|`|PaKCWpGSaa	as of now, No hes got potential,|`|c90babe3997defb30d3067b05482e168aa	You are an idiot|`|xHc3KGDmaa	to soon to tell he is only a rookie|`|u7GBP579aa	wow! I MEAN WOWWWWWWWWWW! HE is only a rookie, and what has he done to be even labeled as a ELI MANNING or TOM BRADY. If it wasnt for his defense and his recievers catching badly thrown balls he would have been up the creek. He has even won a super bowl yet and Hall Of FAmer QB are based upon that. Matt Ryan had a better season with mediocore recievers wich he made good. Flacco hasnt had a BIG game yet, he just doesnt make many mistakes.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	He could tear his knee up in the preseason next year and never play another game again. It's a little early for this talk.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|RK9bJPOmaa	More like Matt Ryan. He is a beast.

This guy could be playing a long time in Baltimore as the franchise QB. For the most part he seemed to have a level head about him, he played smart. He also has a big arm and is pretty accurate too, for a rookie QB. Working with Derrick Mason probably helped too. I imagine Mason was able to offer some insight as a WR with hall of fame potential.     Also the Ravens offensive unit had a knack for scoring big in the 4th quarter quite a bit this season, he was the QB.     I think Flacco has the chance to do some big things with the Ravens, but he's going into his second professional season. I'd taper off on the hall of fame discussion. He's had one great season by a rookie's standards, to make the hall of fame you need to have a great career.|`|hdCPF6rqaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA    Good Joke|`|hSwdJeb9aa	You are funny, joe flacco can't throw much!!!

4kdlE54Paa	In the first round, it will not be a QB or WR like most of these guys think.  What the 49ers really need is an O line and pass rusher on D.  They should concentrate on that for the first 3 or 4 rounds.    Players I would like to see picked up in the 1st round are:    Jason Smith OT  Michael Oher OT    but will likely be in contention for:    Brian Crushing LB  Everett Brown DE/OLB  Rey Maualuga  LB    I would be happy with any of those choices.  We really need a strong pass rusher though.  Everett Brown could be that key person.    Thumbs up to those who agree.    Edit:  Anyone who thinks that Shaun Hill will not cut it is crazy.  He may not be Tom Brady or Peyton Manning, but he is confident in the pocket and gets it done.  Everyone seems to not notice that he has a record of 7 wins and 3 losses as a starter for the 49ers in 2 seasons.  He wiil do just fine in the run first offense that Singletary wants to use going forward.|`|eDCyle05aa	Michael Crabtree|`|Y43nptlvaa	Jeremy Maclin if he falls that far|`|rLTHQWeEaa	it depends what the niners do in free agency they should get a good all pro tackle and wide reciver maybe some others so the three main conserns would be fs,dt,passrusher and some people think niners should get malcolm jenkins but if they get a qb wtf|`|yg3Pveakaa	I say getting a WR(Crabtree will be great) and a Tackle..Improve their offense because they have a good D. and with one season in his belt i think coach singletary will give alot of tips to his D.|`|tNerdFYsaa	Mark Sanchez because Hill just isn't going to cut it, and the guy has shown major strides in this college season and is a great fit to their O|`|el17UWSUaa	QB Colt Mccyoooyo|`|djpYRpO4aa	Graham Gano|`|nIOEaOxBaa	Crabtree would be nice.  College all-star, but I doubt he'll fall that far into the draft, he's too good.  If they grab a QB this year, it'll probably be Texas Tech's QB.  He's pretty good, but anyone with some sense in them knows that if Detriot dosen't grab Sanchez, they're plain stupid.  I'd actually focus on getting another Wide Out or a DT.|`|61Du6GNmaa	Probably an improvement in the WR spot. Bruce is gone after this. Sorry... Crabtree Wont be available. He will be out 2nd Round.|`|GIVarsPnaa	49ers have about 3 major needs coming into the offseason:    QB: Not really necessary but Hill may not be the real answer so Mark Sanshez is a possibility.    Pass Rusher/D-Lineman: Orakpo, Maybin, Brown..etc.    O-Lineman: Preferably someone at RT because Sims and Snyder is not going to cut it.|`|v0FVM6vHaa	the best offensive tackle left. oher, smith, or monroe. the 49ers played barry sims at right tackle, he sucks. the team also gave up 55 sacks. chilo rachal played guard at the end of the year and played well and they already drafted webster at center so this is the only weak pot on the line. hill and morgan are young and look good at wr to go with issac bruce. we could use safety help but dashon goldson should beat out mark roman who needs to go.    i could go on but you get the idea!

Year in and year out they think that their cubbies are oh so great just because they have a good regular season record.  Unfortunately for them, the only thing that counts is winning the world series.  Also, they trash other teams that accomplish more than them.  Cubs fans need to learn to respect other teams and learn a little bit more about baseball.  Win a world series and then you can talk a little more trash.|`|cM3jYmIYaa	Gayest and the most annoying. Face it,you go to drink and screw Soriano. Wrigley is like a cactus, lots of pricks around there.|`|VwccuEFHaa	Not all are bad, which is a shame for any team with bad fans, those who are actually loyal have to be seen in that group.  Unfortunately its true, most of their fans are drunk toughguys who hop on the bandwagon whenever theres a hint of success.  Then when the team falls flat, they whine like they have been loyal for 100 years and are all of a sudden sick of it.  Its annoying to say the least.  Cubs fans have ego's, they think they are the best, most loyal fans in the universe.  Again, its a shame for the select fans that actually stick with the team and dont ***** whenever they dont win a championship.|`|Qs02A0Rqaa	Annoying!?!  We're just the best fans in the MLB. Just because we believe and we've been by our team for a hundred years, doesn't mean you other fans have to hate us. We have a great team, we've just had bad luck.

GO CUBS GO!!!|`|AxeOdUFQaa	theyre not annoying-there just loyal. we love our team and never had and never will give up on our cubbies. we believe that curses do not last forever and one year we wont have to say "just wait till next year", which will hopefully be this year.

EVER.    Go White Sox!!!|`|YQXZJnKMaa	shut the **** up, cubs fans are annoying to non-cubs fans because they are jealous of the way we like our team    white sox fans are WAY more annoying    We don't need to degrade the other teams fans because we know we have the best    It's just like anything eles, if you need to talk down another team, or talk up your team, it means that you are jealous of them and want to be like them

hktObp72aa	Just about all fighters cut weight. I walk around at 160 and fight at 145 and even 135 once.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	Yes, they do tend to run lighter.  I'll tell you some practical reasons, but it's also to important to consider that socially many boxers who grew up on the streets of Havana or Guadalajaro eating a bowl of rice per day or even our Brooklyn, trained for a style of fighting that would favor long and lean versus guys that wrestled in college and had the finest food and nutrition available to them who preferred to get very, very strong.    The sport of boxing is more contingent on endurance and the ability to continue exploding over and over again - so extra muscle than one's skeleton would normally come with can actually make it harder for the boxer to keep his hands up later in the fight.  Boxing may be 8-12 3:00 rounds normally, so except for the heavier divisions, it behooves the boxer to be built like a triathlete.  This type of training produces a longer leaner athlete.  A good example of this was when 6'2" Antonio Tarver knocked out 5'10" Roy Jones Jr. at 185lbs.    Contrarily, the sport of mixed martial arts is equally as contingent on being able to control your opponent with muscular strength.  UFC fights as well as other similar martial arts competitions are usually 3-5 rounds of 3-5:00 minutes, so the long, long marathon work is not as sport specific as a blend of anaerobic and aerobic endurance as well as strenght training.  This type of conditioning produces a stockier athlete.  A good example of this was when Diaz, a better boxer than Guida, kept getting over powered by the stronger man in the last UFC.      Here is the Nevada State Athletic Commission's Weight Classes for Mixed Martial Arts:   (Like what the UFC would adhere to if it was being held in the MGM Grand)    Weight class name Upper limit in lbs Equivalent in kg   Flyweight 125 lb 57 kg   Bantamweight 135 lb 61 kg   Featherweight 145 lb 66 kg   Lightweight 155 lb 70 kg   Welterweight 170 lb 77 kg   Middleweight 185 lb 84 kg   Light Heavyweight 205 lb 93 kg   Heavyweight 265 lb 120 kg   Super Heavyweight No upper weight limit       Here is the World Boxing Association's Weight Divisions:    Above 200 lb (90.72 kg) Heavyweight   200 lb (90.72 kg) Cruiserweight   175 lb (79.4 kg) Light heavyweight   168 lb (76.2 kg) Super middleweight   160 lb (72.6 kg) Middleweight   154 lb (69.9 kg) Super welterweight   147 lb (66.7 kg) Welterweight   140 lb (63.5 kg) Super lightweight   135 lb (61.2 kg) Lightweight   130 lb (59.0 kg) Super featherweight   126 lb (57.2 kg) Featherweight   122 lb (55.3 kg) Super bantamweight   118 lb (53.5 kg) Bantamweight   115 lb (52.2 kg) Super flyweight   112 lb (50.8 kg) Flyweight   108 lb (49.0 kg) Light flyweight   105 lb (47.6 kg) Minimumweight|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Many boxers don't actually walk around 147 lbs... guys like De la hoya walk around 185 lbs. But they go down in order to be all muscle and give themselves the best advantage|`|g7xaB57Xaa	Since stamina and speed is more-so a factor for boxers than in MMA because of the different styles of fighting, (Boxing is just fists, the padding of the gloves make the fights last longer, and the distance is usually closer because they dont have to kick or usually add longer distance lunging attacks to their arsenal.) I imagine that has alot to do with being fast on the feet instead of having a more compact, muscular body type, which helps for strenght based attacks to get those KO's with the thinner padded gloves.  Grappling strength usually also comes easier for more compact fighter bodies.  Fedor is usually the more compact fighter compared to his opponents, and look what he gets done.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	They are in great shape.

BbK0fA4Laa	He knows 5 different martial arts.    He knows karate as he was a professional karate fighter and champion.     He has studied Tang Soo Do. He studied Tang Soo Do when stationed in South Korea at the Osan Air Base.     He also  knows Chun Kuk Do since he is the founder of that.     He supposedly has an 8th degree black belt in Taekwondo.  I question whether he really has that Taekwondo black belt though.     He got his start in Tang Soo Do which is a predecessor to Taekwondo. The two are nearly identical. His Tang Soo Do black belt is probably doubling as a Taekwondo black belt. Nevertheless, he has been inducted into the Taekwondo Hall of Fame.    And lastly, he studied some Brazilian jiu-jitsu  when he was staring in the walker Texas ranger series. He studied that under Carlos Machado.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	He studied a form of Karate that I do not know. He created Chun Kuk Do and also is ranked pretty highly, brown or black belt, in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	karate, bruce lee style of kung fu, and brazilian jujitsu|`|DOtYOLE2aa	his history is questionable since he did his tornaments without worrying about belt ranks but he did tang soo do korean karate , chuk somthing do, brizilain jiu jitsu with i belive the machado brothers jeet kun do a little with lee himself and various others      his stories on tang solo do belts varie anywhere from he was a brown belt to tenth degree black belt so im not sure what rank but that seems his specialty not to mention he was a world karate champion fighter and a built man      edit - it was chuk kuk do as said by clowns qand also why would someone ansewer if they don no???|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	A competitor tried to tackle him in a tournament in NEW YORK and CHUCK pitched him over his shoulder in his younger days .He had a brown belt in JUDO prior to studying TANG SOO DO in KOREA.I believe his 8TH DAN in TKD is honorary .TKD is famous for awarding ranks to famous people to promote themselves like ROBBINS the self help guru.He trained with LEE and worked with JOE LEWIS on full contact fighting .He has also trained with the MACHADO BROS.
zpIKtqNvaa	Ok, good match-ups but a really lng card for a 4 hours PPV. Each match could only be about 16 minutes long and probably less than that because you have to include promos and everything else that they run like the hall of fame inductee's coming out. Also with every title being on the line, that would really damper the prestige of Night of Champions.|`|iAdxiJ23aa	http://kmansbeach.com/register.php?REF=3...|`|Gr7My8FTaa	yea and here are my guesses    Cena  HHH  Mark Henry  Mysterio  MVP  Winner of battle royal  Cryme Tyme  Melina  Michelle McCool  Christian  Taker  Khali hands down  Big Show  Y2J|`|CJzbIhWuaa	no, u mentioned specialty matches dont happen too often but neither do the mid-card title matches, just the main championships, either bourne or dreamer will face swagger, there will be only 1 divas match, and rourke wont wrestle, there are more problems too|`|Kecfbgm5aa	umm actually most of the matches r likeley like hhh/edge and cena/orton but this is card is amatuerish. dont expect the divas title on the line and expect swagger/dreamer. also i dont see both the ic and us title being defended at once. there will also be no khali and u forgot matt vs jeff
gUMucKOkaa	You need to provide a lot more info on the type of league, scoring, etc. Is there something unusual about the league that would make people want ot join? Otherwise people can join any league.
