BB3RcWwZaa	Nice, smooth, creamy skin... it's the truth; every guy goes for it. This applies to her face most of all. Then she has to have booty and substance, and she can't be fat, otherwise the mere thought of her makes me vomit. She has to at least try to look good too, because I do :), and it's a misunderstood stereotype that girls go through a lot more trouble in looking good than the guys do.|`|4WjZTF1saa	i think if a girl takes good care of her self, it will show. which in turn makes her good looking. nice hair, good posture, nice face... if any girl tried hard enough they could look good i think.|`|IeZkqmIQaa	A good hygiene, a girl who can be independent and not be all gloomy or bitchy.

1HJwuQhAaa	cetaphil cream is amazing. none of that fragrance or dyes and its very well for sensitive skin and wont break you out. you can try the cetaphil cream for a more heavy moisture or the daily face lotion for a lighter feel. ive used this for a year and i have rosacea and this is the only stuff that doesnt break me out. good luck!|`|76nTvO4iaa	I like Clinique moisturizer - the yellow one.|`|v0FlUan0aa	Merlot.|`|ar2So81eaa	Arbonne is a fabulous product. It's all about PH balence. http://www.arbonne.com/  I started using their AntiAging line about 6 months ago. So great. There are a few steps to the system, but they bece second nature. I would never go back.    And I would recommend the antiaging line for anyone. You might not be old now, but one day you will be. This helps you stay ahead of the game.    PS: I also reccomend the primer. I never thought it was necessary, but now I swear by it. My makeup looks more natural and lasts longer.|`|LUVBrg3Maa	I use clean & clear day soft moisturizer with spf 15, its oil-free and works great for me. good luck!|`|KrC3asyRaa	Give this a go, if you need a sample contact me    http://www.nutrimetics.com.au/leanneleac...    also contact me if you want it for half price!|`|JkpyLnfDaa	Aveeno is amazing, its very gentle but it tones out your skin while mousturizing|`|SZiLawWXaa	Ponds moisturizing cream.

The most painful of them all? A conch piercing (through the little "bowl" of your ear). Just the cracking sound alone was very unnerving , but the healing process sucked too!|`|d4cmjFsJaa	It really does all depend on your pain threshold.    Earlobe: 1  Cartilage: N/A  Nose; 3  Shot: 3  Tongue: N/A  Wrist Tattoo: N/A    I've had my lip pierced twice and thought it hurt less than my nose, as well as two tattoos, one on my hand and one on my neck, both were probably 4's.     But it really does depend, My best friend passed out when he got his lip pierced and I've seen people cry, then there are others who take it like it's a nothing. Most of the time though, at least I think, the five minutes before the pain are worse than the pain itself.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	Regular earlobe piercing?

It has temperature selection so you can decide how hot you want the flat iron. Also, it is a GVP. It is generic for CHI. It is basically the same as a CHI without the name. It is good (well as good as flat irons can get) for your hair. You will not find a better straightener under $100. Plus it comes in cute colors!!|`|AA11313920	I recently bought a pretty similar straightener, it was a Revlon Perfect Heat 1". $25 at Target.

I don't know how much my straightener cost, because I got it as a present, but it seems like a reasonable price. You may want to go for something a bit lower, but overall this straightener seems like a good one!  You might want to see if you can find one with a built in brush thing because it makes your hair really soft afterwards, and I think it helps the straightening.|`|L5mmBuooaa	its a good straightener and a good price...    if you r still looking for others i suggest ...    http://www.myhairstylingtools.com/karmin...    this one has the latest tourmaline-ceramic technology. if the price is above budget...look at Target for the Remington wet2dry ( w/ tourmaline/ceramic technology)...its about $25...and it works great!!|`|2xEkFFvaaa	The best hair straightners are GHD but your looking at about $100 - $150 i have a remmington wed2straight micro diamond straightner it goes up to 230 degrees.

If you have long think hair its better to buy the wider straightners as its easier for short thin hair the one your looking at would be ok. but i deffinatly recomend you keep looking just in case.

Then buy hair care products that protect the colour while nourishing your hair.|`|yVdW756Gaa	When you buy it look and make sure it comes with a good conditioner for your hair.

PCsW0gbPaa	Well, it won't damage your hair or anything.  In fact, people used to use regular soap on the hair all the time.  Shampoo wasn't invented until modern times.  But it probably won't give you the results you want.  It be quite drying and might leave it feeling kind of filmy.  Maybe you could just skip a day on washing your hair. Some people say your hair looks best after a few days without a wash.|`|hTBZ1OA5aa	I'm sure if you used it once, then it wouldn't destroy your hair or anything like that.

SZrxMeQoaa	You have to be more specific, sweetheart. :)  But in my experience, yes it is worth it - BUT (and notice the capitals ;)), only if you know how to apply it correctly, and as long as you're not overdoing it. Also, makeup should be used to bring out your natural beauty...not hide behind it.|`|7E1mbz4jaa	it all depends on if your  comfortable with the way you already look?  if you do want to but you not fully sure, maybe just wear a little bit or mascara of foundation to start...  personally, i think makeup is awesome!!!  and it can make you fell confident.  hope i helped :)|`|MbRygPqTaa	If you make it Fun for You.

It's relative.|`|63jMnc0qaa	it depends on the person....if you have good skin and good features then you don't need to load on the makeup, but i think mascara is an absolute MUST for every girl, regardless of how pretty you are without any makeup!|`|K8PsgTs8aa	i say.. go as long as you can with out it.  but once your older i think it's worth it to a certain extent.    don't put too much on because then i think it's worse.  you just have to perfect the art.    like me i love the natural look.  and usually that's a lot easier, faster, and you dont need to wear as much.    i feel more confident when i wear it.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	Yeah, it makes me look better|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	Yes, but only if you're doing it for the right reasons.

My nose on the other hand, lol.|`|MHTIe6hTaa	noo don't do it.  keep your nose.    that's what makes you unique.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	No! You're gorgeous.|`|EJL5QoDraa	ur really hot u dont need nose surgery at all|`|v1tHjJ3haa	The truth it does look kinda bad but you look really unique in that way. If you think you'll be happier than probably and if you'll breath better than get it. Don't change the shape or anything, just get it straightend out and your really cute ! your nose actually fits you though it's crooked, not too bad (:|`|s1IkFOJVaa	i dint notice it at all untill this pic  http://i379.photobucket.com/albums/oo232...    but honestly its not that noticeable just keep it like that the only reason i figured it out was cause u pointed it out|`|0d88ab7c3e5ace15a916d7103b2561abaa	don't listen to them i think you should get it done and you will be a lot more confident.. you are beautiful now but i think you would look better w/ the surgery :)|`|ezoKuZLgaa	Yeah, that tends to happen alot when a broken nose goes untreated.  I do reccamend going to a surgon to make a minor adjustment to that.  But keep in mind you'll be altering the bone, so it's gonna be painful.  Not during the procedure, but afterwards.  I'd wait till your 18 though.  It just makes all the paperwork and legal documents a whole lot easier.|`|F8OrjeWsaa	i think your nose looks quite fine, but if YOU are uncomfortable with it and really want surgery, than thats your decision. people shouldnt judge you on that.|`|OfHoaWf7aa	You're fine the way you are!|`|lgubJDN7aa	Girl, your nose looks fine. You are very pretty and what attracts most guys is natural true beauty. I believe you have a pretty face and a cute nose. You don't need it fixed. Honestly I think if you did it, you're just going to want to do more fixing of the face. I don't know if this will help you, but it always helps me. Pray about it and God will give you a correct answer. He made no mistake of how he made you. You're very pretty.|`|t8HPCzrOaa	i think your nose looks great hun and u dont need a nose surgery but its up to u|`|g2h6cgcvaa	noo nothing is wrong with your nose. i like it :)|`|kUhcypC9aa	Ok. My honest opinion. You are a pretty girl and for that reason I dont think you would need surgery.     But.... if it giving you health problems (such as the breathing) then I would definitely go for surgery.    To be honest (after all the terrible bruising and swelling) has gone down I bet you will be very pleased and look even prettier.    Good luck.|`|9Y9BBB99aa	dont do it lol  your reeaalll hot|`|hTBZ1OA5aa	No! don't get nose surgery, you have a cute nose. :) You don't have a thing to worry about! :)|`|F0vnLoaIaa	i dont think u need a nose job u look fine the way u are =]|`|GIqna1ifaa	no it looks normal!|`|rHhtn7plaa	go to a doc and see what they say since you can't breath to good maybe a bone is obstructing your nostril .|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Yes.  Do it.  You've got pretty significant damage from when it was broken.  It's not that you look bad, it's just that your nose is obviously abnormal and it's not even working the way it's supposed to if you can't breath easily.  No one is going to think you're fake.  If I broke my finger and got it re-set, it's not being superficial and phony.|`|2WJQmnKzaa	you COULD and you have a legit reason to, but its deff not nessesary. go to your doctor or a plastic surgeon and talk about what he would be able to fix.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	I happen to think that you are pretty just as you are...I think you should not worry about what other people think, as it's what is inside you that is going to determine who your true friends will end up being. You have to do what is right for you.  Why don't you make an appointment with someone who can tell you what your options are? Find out if there is much difference to be gained by the surgery. Can you obtain computer images? Then, if it's still something you want, then at least you have all the information available. Good luck.|`|oMDB0oipaa	your so... pretty dont change anything :))|`|jC4U6MCmaa	your gorgeoous  your nose is adorable  keep it but maybe get the whole breathing thing fixed  lol  anyway  its cute on you  you can totally pull it off|`|sjgF1yjJaa	My gf's mom had to do that when she was about your age and it really helped out, so whatever you want|`|f2D4q1R3aa	I think you should see a doctor if you can't breath well out of one nostril, but just to get that bone fixed so you could breath but don't change the shape.|`|vEoJO3gBaa	I think its kinda cute and quirky!!  But.... if you cannot breath you have to go to a doctor and see what he recommends. But I would see if there other options besides surgery. I like it how it is!     You are GORGEOUS by the way!|`|txGreUxZaa	i dont think you should get it, it makes you individual and when your smiling, you have a perfect smile so i didnt even notice your nose(: also you know ashlee simpson got a nose job and people we saying she shouldnt have, well i don't anyone really minds about what your nose is like, its your personality!     hope this helps(:  xx|`|OUvQQJAsaa	You are very pretty!  It's rare that your nose would keep growing at the age of 16.  If you get a rhinoplasty you will look more conventionally beautiful, but I say don't go for it, nothing beats natural beauty, which you've got right now.|`|O8wLw6aQaa	1. You should wait until 20 or 21, closer to when you have finished growing probably. Not that it wouldn't help now but perhaps in the next few years your chin will grow or something similar allowing the doctor to more appropriately shape your nose. Though even if you do have something done i doubt it would be a major change.    2. You are very pretty now. If you are having trouble breathing through your nose then there is nothing wrong with surgery. But look inside yourself and see if this desire is coming from a place of wanting something else in your life to change.    3. Jennifer Grey - tough example, sure, but she was not as pretty or distinctive looking after her nose job. Same with Ashlee Simpson in my mind.    Best of luck.

AA12324049	Try using a leave-in silicone-based conditioner, such as Frizz Ease's "Downplay" which is both a conditioner and a volume-reducer.    A chemical hair relaxer might also help (they're usually intended for people with curly hair, but it's all about breaking down protein bonds, and stiff hair tends to be stiff because it has too many protein bonds).    If you are using any products that are supposed to build your hair proteins or "add body", stop using them, they're making the problem worse.    You might also try putting olive oil in your hair (avoid the roots), letting it sit for an hour, washing it out, and then immediately applying a conditioner.    Some people with stiff hair will also use handcream/skin moisturizer on their hair to soften it a little.    As for greasy hair, if you aren't washing it everyday that would help.  If you are, try a little baby powder on the roots (a little goes a long way).    If all else fails, seek out the help of a professional hairdresser.  But don't go to just anyone!  Ask around and find a hairdresser who has experience with your type of hair.  It might cost a little but I bet it would be worth every penney if it helps you feel better about your hair.    Good luck!
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick something up locally, I recommend trying the following products:  Drugstore:  L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo  Organic/specialty store (like whole foods):  Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel  ULTA:  Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)    These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)

You can't really make hair grow that much faster, most you can do it keep it healthy.  Eat&sleep well , too.|`|Z73Ko2p8aa	dont blow dry, flat iron, or curl your hair..buy vitamins at your local health store for hair..also make sure you trim your hair every 3 months..like 1 to 1 1/2 inches.
9VB4uWhMaa	I'll be 40 this summer and have used Mary Kay since I was 19 or so.  I don't have any wrinkle and look much younger than my age.    My  1 secret that I've been doing since I was about your age is putting Vaseline under my eyes at bed time.  I think this has helped prevent wrinkles from forming around my eyes.  Vaseline doesn't cause breakouts either, like you'd think it would.  I swear by the stuff!     My best friend from high school always thought I was crazy for putting Vaseline under my eyes at bed time but when she started getting wrinkly in her mid 30's and I didn't she finally started using Vaseline too and it's helped her so much.  She didn't get rid of her wrinkles but the she hasn't gotten any new wrinkles.|`|9qSF7zT3aa	I'm almost 29. I use Clinique and love it. Yes, keep using it.

Can't remember the name. But both work beautifully together.|`|KrC3asyRaa	Honestly im a skincare a beauty freak! And i use Nutrimetics, ive used soo many different skincare products ranging from Matis to Clinique lancome and the cheapo stuff at priceline.   If your living in Australia or New Zealand the best skincare for us Aussie women is Nutrimetics, because Nutrimetics is designed and made in Australia for Australian and New Zealand women for our enviroment.    Clinique is popular. BUT it is made overseas for european women and their environment. Therefore it is not the best skincare for us.    Nutrimetics is natural and it is cheaper than Clinique.   With Nutrimetics there is a skincare set to suit every skin type. oily, combination, dry. And if your concerned with ageing there is a anti ageing range.  but for your age i would recommend Hydrafinity which fights back first signs of aging.  we are a natural company and have a 60day money back guarantee!    Im a consultant, and im willing to offer you a in home consultation for FREE, and ill let you try the products for me. In in the Sydney area.

zL5GvUoQaa	try bathing it with warm slat water 2 or 3 times a day and don't it out with soap or anything like that, just keep using the salt and if its not getting any better you can try buying some real gold jewelery and go back the piercer and ask them to change it, mine was infected when i first had it done and i changed to to real gold jewelry and it was fine after a few days, i think it has something to do with the matals in the stainless jewelery etc|`|HwrmAgzuaa	three days? I'd wait at least a month to even question if it's infected or not  It needs to heal first because if you think about it...you just put a hole and metal into your body and it's not exactly used to it.    Just keep cleaning it daily....use hot water with sea salt and use lots of soap on it (wash it out after, though)|`|WodlreGLaa	Try to put some tea tree oil on it, You can buy this at most Pharmacy's.

Washing with anti bacterial soap is not a bad way to heal, but it's not the best. A couple of other commonly suggested products that you should NEVER use to heal a piercing are alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and neosporin. The anti bacterial soap doesn't kill microbes and is too drying; alcohol and hydrogen peroxide disturb the cell structure of the healing skin inside the piercing and will set you back from proper healing rather than promoting healing; and the neosporin clogs the piercing and doesn't allow oxygen to get to the healing tissue.    You can get a small bottle of Satin soap from your professional piercer; this is an anti microbial soap that kills everything if you follow the directions carefully.     You should also, while you're there, pick up a spray can of H2Ocean, which is basically a saline solution. If they don't carry it, you can make your own using this recipe:  8 oz warm water [as hot as you can stand it]   1/4 tsp of sea salt  Using a clean paper towel each time, you should soak the piercing with the warm salt water twice a day, morning and evening. If you use the H2Ocean, you can spray that on the piercing 5 or 6 times a day a lot more conveniently because you can carry that with you to school or work etc.    Navel piercings are notorious for taking a long time to heal because of their location at the center of two kinds of movement at your waist: both bending back and forth and twisting side to side. How long you stay sore will depend on you and your body. I never had any pain with my belly button piercing, but everybody's different.    It's very important that you do not touch the jewelry or piercing with unwashed hands. Use the warm water of your shower with the Satin soap to get the "crusties" [the presence of "crusties" is completely normal and not an indication of an infection] off the jewelry.     If at some point you DO get an infection there [the piercing will be a lot more painful, there will be a lot of redness, and you may find you have pus coming out of either end or both ends of the hole] you still don't have to remove the jewelry if you soak the piercing with warm salt water solution 3-4 times a day. The infected piercing actually heals better with the jewelry IN place because there's still a conduit to allow the piercing to drain the infected material.    I would also pick up an aftercare sheet on healing navel piercings from your piercer while you're there to get the aftercare products.    You can also read anything and everything you needed to know about healing body modifications from http://www.bmezine.com .|`|9qSF7zT3aa	This is perfectly normal. For your piercing is still a new born babe. Just continue to clean it 2-3 times daily. Do not touch it unless you clean it. Sleep on your side or back instead of your stomach. Wear low rise pants and don't wear your shirts and tanks too tight. Taking a vitamin C pill or zinc can help with healing. Oh, and you really should wait about six months to change it out due to light blood flow to the area causing slower healing time.|`|YvqAM2qMaa	just keep it really clean! if it is hurting and producing puss you can get a warm cup of sea salt water and put it on your belly and rinse it around.|`|AA12087111	Your piercing may be a bit red and sore for a while as some piercings do, Every ones body reacts different when it comes to healing.  Remember to never twist, turn, or pull on it,as doing so can cause it to reject out. clean it with SEA SALT(non-iodized) and WATER, or H2ocean solution  3-4 times a day. If you are feeling any discomfort you can always go back to your piercer and have them take a look at it.|`|ogGHAN9Paa	its normal.  i qot mine exactly three weeks aqo.  && when i qot it it was red.   and it hurted for a lil while.  it stays sore for approximately 1week && half..  whatever you do do not take it out unless you want to close.  its increasinq your risk of infection.  clean it with dial & saline solution   and it should be normal.

YAJrXPXuaa	Chill mate...    You will be fine, it's just an earlobe piercing... nothing too sore.    I got my seconds done 2 weeks ago and it was kind of a hard quick pinch, it was so quick!    I got mine done a chemist and they gave me this solution that you use about 3 times a day, and its called 'Surgical Spirt'    Spray it on the front and the back of the pierced and then slightly twist it.    The reason why we twist it is bcos it prevents it fron the skin trying to heal up over the piercing, so make sure you do that every night.    You have to wait 6 weeks until you are able to take out the piercing to change it.     It doesn't hurt when it's just been pierced it's more of a throbbing sensation, and it usually stops on the in the next two days.|`|AA11051531	lol it really doesn't hurt much~|`|LTRQA6Zfaa	Don't worry. It does't hurt at all. Those story are bull.    I got my earlobe pierced when I was 6. I got a second hole 4 months ago and cartalige a month ago. I'm a guy and I'm 13.    The only thing you have to do it take care of it for 4 weeks, then you may change it. The best thing to use to treat it is benzalkonium chloride found in any ear care antiseptic.    Hope I helped! |`|wd7okk2daa	you won't even feel it! And as long as you clean your ears you should be fine, I think I might have used the solution on my ears like twice? and I never got an infection.

Good luck, and enjoy =)|`|ntb2rNXcaa	getting your ears pierced isn't that bad you'll be fine. normaly they give you a cleaning solution after they do it. or you can get some from claires.  if you don't wear dangly earrings then you don't have to worry about getting them caught on anything but even if you do they don't really get in the way.   when buying other earrings i recomend getting ones for sensitive ears. stray away from cheap ones that will hurt your ears.  as for the growing over part as long as youtake care of your self and use the solution you should be fine, skin doesnt grow over earrings just like that! you'll notice and be able to take care of them.    for a little more info here is a very helpful care site  http://www.essortment.com/lifestyle/earp...    take care!|`|5S6PFk6waa	Honestly the worst part for me when I had my ears pierced was cleaning them they had to be turned and the cleanser had to be applied which my mom helped me with since I was only nine. I can only speak from my own personal experience that  the actually act of having them pierced was not painful but afterward they did stink a little but not so bad that I couldn't handle it and only for a few hours. If you really want your ears pierced you just have to accept all that goes along with it and ask yourself if the little pinch that your gonna endure worth it. It really is mind over matter I understand where your coming from being concerned I was too when I got mine and I had them done at the mall. Piercing has came along way since then and as long as your going to a experienced professional you should have absolutely no worries.|`|FW93xc6Raa	Relax!  You'll be fine as long as you follow the aftercare instructions your dermatologist gives you.  The earrings you have a fine, you don't need to get another kind.|`|OuaUAAZlaa	when you get your ears pierced (which doesnt hurt at all), the piercer (or doctor in your case) will give you solution to put on your new piercing at night and will explain how to use it.    usually you wait about 6-8 weeks before removing studs from your ears.    the 14kt earrings from claires are fine to wear as your new earrings.    if your ear should get infected, dont panic.  all you have to do is use neosporin and itll go away within a couple of days.    good luck with the piercings !! :)

I found a picture listing fifty of the MAC shades and showing the colors. That's all I could really find.

It doesn't have to be bright, it should be simple, with nice accessories- the California style.      http://www.gojane.com/31352-dresses-flor...  http://www.bcbg.com/product/index.jsp?pr...      Your going to want somethign flowy, and your going to want something subtle, not too formal, but not too casual.    The first dress is great if hte dance is more on the casual side. Curl your hair so you get loose beachy waves with a 1 1/2 inch curling iron, and grab yourself a pair of wedges and you have a hit!    if your dance is more formal, go for the second one, and pair that with a curlier look, teasing the crown of the hair a little bit and pinning it up into a pouf, pairing it with simple silver strappy heels.    Good luck!      Edit:    i think the bebe dress is cute, but i think they're also better ones out there. If your going with the bebe, you should go with gold accessories, and a nice pair of gold wedges

In order to make your eyes really stand out, it's better to go with a solid color rather than a color plus highlights. A rich dark brown will really make your green eyes pop.     As for eye shadow, try different shades of purple. Purple really contrasts with the green and makes it stand out.|`|RMdKNJWtaa	I'm not a fan or hair coloring, nor do I have experience with it...I do however love eye shadow and contrasts.    For green eyes I would suggest a deep purple shade;     For the day time, gold in the corners (towards the tear ducts).     For the evening add black eyeliner and may switch up the gold for a   deep shimmery green pencil.|`|UfPVZbRxaa	i would just dye your hair like a almond brown kinda like like miley cyrus hair color and for eye shadow purple really makes my green eyes stand out but it makes me look natural so i would go for that
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	You need a moisturizing conditioner and also a leave in conditioner to use under your styling products. My fav winter condish is Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle rose which you can get at a store like whole foods. If you can't find that try L'oreal vive pro nutri gloss for curly/wavy hair. It's nearly as good. My current leave in is giovanni direct leave in which is at WF and ULTA. My gel is Herbal Essences Body Envy, which smells great and is working well in the winter.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair.

Its better to go with a professional shampoo the over the counter with that curly of hair you will be glad in the end . Try Biologe or Redgen products for the best or if you have to go over the counter look for ?any thing but pantene.|`|k5unIdZmaa	If you like to go to bed with your hair wet ( as in you take a shower before bed) you could brush your hair so it straight and put mouse in it, abd then your could put it in a ponytail or a tight bun.                                             OR  You could just use pantene Pro-V as your shampoo and use the striaghtening one ( idk what its called lol sry) and straighten your hair :)    HOPE I HELPED CHA!!!! ;)|`|m4KFa7yiaa	i have the same problem, when my hair is curly its really dry and frizzy but i straighten it most of the time :D  what you COULD do is get an oil treatment from your stylist  it makes your hair REALLY soft  eating things with oil helps too, but it wont affect the hair that's already dry  use more conditioner on your hair and leave it in for longer (dont use too much on your scalp)  thats all i got :P|`|4ceE9TFcaa	do you want it to be less curly, or do you want to do something against the dryness?    against curls:  Use a relaxing series - if you combine with a straightener, you'll get the hair nearly straight.  BUT it will get even drier and it will get thinner.    or go to a hairdresser's and get a chemical straightening. It will keep your hair straight for about a year, as far as I know.      against dry hair:  use a hair mask, once or twice a week.  you can get a product either for dry hair, or one for curly hair. both will give your hair the nutritive plus it needs.  because curly hair is naturally drier than is straight hair.    good luck, hope this helps.|`|AA11227341	hey Strike,  yea me too, I use Proclaim Professional Care---glossing polish---frizz eliminating shiner; it makes my hair look nice--the wet look and I get to keep the curls and yes I am a guy with long curly hair and it look awesome.   gee|`|06JZOx3Yaa	Yeah cut it off..|`|lxJoXNZwaa	My friend had the same problem.  She uses coconut oil - you can find it at health food stores.  Her hair would get dry and frizzy until she used coconut oil.  It is natural and won't dry your hair out, no chemicals.  Coconut oil has many uses. Coconut oil is also good for softening skin.  In cooking/baking Coconut Oil is better for you than butter.  By the way, a little bit goes a long way. Hope this works.|`|8e885c463613a2a46008f0074c740cbcaa	There is a serum you can put on your hair called nourishing milk coconut milk that's wonderful!

SZrxMeQoaa	Sweetheart, it doesn't sound dumb!  I've felt this way too, so don't worry. You're not the only one. ;)  You're gorgeous the way you are, and you're right - you shouldn't change for a guy, because a guy should accept you for who you are.  Maybe you could enhance your best features. You have pretty eyes...so maybe wearing eyeliner and mascara would bring them out.   But don't overdo on the makeup. :)  Good Luck! I hope it works out, girl.|`|MgiK02Zbaa	get over it.      im over it.|`|YqdU6SS6aa	You definitely don't need to do much. Put on a little eye make-up. I would use something earth toned and shimmery, or go for color if you're more adventurous, and definitely mascara. But my biggest tip would be to cut your hair. To me it just looks long and lacks style. If you want to keep it long, have some layers or something put in. Hair cuts can do wonders!! I would suggest a longer angled bob, not the super short one.   Just my opinions!|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	Sweetie you don't need to do anything. You are gorgeous, have sexy curves, pretty eyes and shiney soft hair. Guys love long hair. Most love curves and baby you got it going on. Just be yourself and if he can't see how beautiful you are inside and out then he's not worth it.|`|uYRPFlJWaa	I think you look gorgeous but since you asked... Go with a purple Eyeshadow with black mascara, a more redder lipstick/gloss and a darker more earthy foundation|`|HypPc34Baa	You are so pretty so you dont even need to worry. But if i were you I would do gold/brown eyeshadow. Start with a light color, like a shimmery cream in the corner of your eye near your nose, and blend it with a darker gold/brown and have it get gradually darker as you get to the outside corner or your eye. Wear this with brown eye liner and mascara. Just be careful not to put too much on or it will look unnatural.|`|MHTIe6hTaa	no, don't change for him. If he doesn't notice you, oh well move on. It'll be his loss. Your a pretty girl and you don't need to change for anyone.|`|mGQOgjeYaa	you don't need to change anything. your hot!
Rivzjjckaa	It all depends on what kind of make-up you will use and how/if you know how to correctly use it.     I would reccomend going to a local beauty therapist or even a chemist where they sell cosmetics and get them to tell how to correctly use them and what colours are best for you.    Concealer and foundation are crititical in getting the right colour-always try before you buy.    So yes make-up does/can make girls look better, a little mascara and eyeliner can brighten the eyes and lip gloss can look sexy while concealer and foundation can give a smooth and even look to your skin.  Just dont go over board. Start with small amounts and work your way up.     It never hurts to try something new : )|`|livX6UG1aa	Make-up enhances any look. Depending on what is needed, there are multiple different techniques.     If you have a MAC store anywhere near you, they will teach all the techniques if you guarentee that you will buy 40$ worth of the products they use (Which is seriously 3 eyeshadows!)     but, their make-up works for SUPER long!     Other stores like Make-Up Forever and sephora also have helpful hints!     Hope that helps!|`|oW2UQMRCaa	Yep. Make-up will do wonders.|`|DXdMMrAcaa	The easiest and most important things you can do to make your face look better is to wear a little blush.  The blush should somewhat match your lips, and it can't be too bronze or too pink.  Smile and apply the makeup at the apples of your cheeks.  Mascara is important too.      If your skin is blotchy, and not even toned, coverup makeup is great.  Always get a shade or two lighter than your skin color, nothing is worse than coverup that is darker.      And most importantly, some people look great without makeup, and if you are confident in the way you look, don't start to wear it.  Your face should have a nice contrast.  Meaning your eyes and lips should stand out.|`|IW6GEWRsaa	Yes!  depending on how its applied  it will do wonders!

CyIxcsz0aa	It all depends on your hair, in the case of the hair. But if you have straigh hair, apply some mousse and scrunch ir in damp hair while blow drying, (you may also be able to use mousse on dry ahir depending on how stubborn your hair is)<br>  The eyes just mean a lot of jet black eye liner and mascara. I like the ones that aren't regulsr pencils but spin up. Go a little extra past the corner of your eye from the top! Apply the eyeliner at the top AND bottom. Use a dark gray eye shadow. <br>  <br>  Everyone's eyes are different, but the bottom of your eye is where you have control over the shape of your eye.

ebcWxC8daa	that's normal. its like when u have your ears pierced and then u take out the earrings and squeeze your ear, it feels like a bump is there. its because when u pierce something it pushes the skin to make the hole and that skin heals like that so its sorta like the shape of the bar beneath your skin you know? so when u take it out u can feel it because the skin already healed and isnt going to go back and fill the hole. catch my drift? idk, its sorta hard to explain... but either way, its normal and you're not infected. when you pierce your belly button or anything else, it feels that way too.|`|7y63ZzK4aa	only idiots pierce their eyebrows you loser, want some attention?    i dont care about your infection! eew!    love, anna(:

You can take a look here.  http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?B=99380&...|`|5N3odm3Qaa	The Michele Deco Diamond in stainless steel and yellow gold. It is $1,695 and can be found here: http://www.michele.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    Also consider the Michele Deco Park Diamond ($1,595): http://www.michele.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    Michele CSX-36 Diamond ($1,395): http://www.michele.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    I owned a Michele Deco Diamond when I was a teenager and I can tell you that those watches hold up to some serious abuse. They look much more expensive than they are and you can switch the bands extremely easily. I still have a strap to match nearly every outfit you could imagine.
YZFk1Eu4aa	Everybody has the ability to be liked no matter what they look like. All personlities can be cute in the eyes of guys. You sound like a really nice and friendly girly so there will be a guy for you, guys like friendly girlies, and guys even go or mean girlies, think of all those mean and stuck up girlies at your school who have boyfriends, lolz...so guys like all kinds coz all kinds are different. Just be yourself and 6 and a quarter isn't a bad rating, it just shows like most of us you are average and most people are average looking and find someone who thinks they are the most beautiful thing that ever waked the earth. :]|`|bOduFl9Baa	IDK, PROBLY|`|Xd7mulQbaa	Trying being more active and getting down to normal weight.

fnQM26BMaa	I did!    All you have to do is curl your hair with a 2 inch curling iron.    Part it on the side, and put it into a side ponytail, LOW on the right side.

0d655ff2cbf8b604b04fb0c3625ae755aa	No matter where you get a tattoo there will be people that have it there already. What makes a tattoo unique is that you put a lot of thought into it and it's either meaningful to you or a great piece of art. I started getting tattooed 20 years ago and everywhere I got a tattoo was really a unique place at the time. Now, many people have tattoos where I have them. Placement is important, but I think it may look odd to have a tattoo in that spot and would be hard to cover it if you wanted to without wearing long pants or a long skirt. There are plenty of other places you can put a tattoo that isnt horribly overdone. Its your tattoo, no one elses, though, so if you like that spot thats all that really matters    When you go to the tattoo studio they can stencil or draw your design there so you can see how it looks, so your best bet would probably be to go to an artist and see if you like it.|`|H3PcFertaa	I agree with Kittythe..  Your focus should not be on what anyone else thinks, does, has done, whatever. You need to get a tattoo that you want and place it where it belongs, .. which is where it would be if you were never going to see another soul and you decided to get a tattoo on your body, .. where would you put it?  Tattoos have been placed on every square inch of skin on human beings for thousands of years. This isn't just getting something different to be different from your current peer group. This is something that you own, that becomes you for the rest of your life.  Rethink your focus, then get the best tattoo from the best artist and do the best aftercare, based on your life and who you are.  luck~|`|0e8ebf1b3303c2bad2271071788e9d3faa	I don't think it is a good idea. But it is your choice.|`|HypPc34Baa	I think that would be a bad place for a tattoo, because it is in a difficult place to see. If you are getting this tattoo in the hopes of having others look at it and like it, then don't get it there. But if it's just for you, then go for it. I personaly dont like the idea though.|`|oVNAPhyWaa	You just seem like your doing your tattoo on your knee because you feel like you have to be unique. It just sorta means you care that your tattoo will look common. If you really want to do it on your knee then go for it but if you also really want to do it somewhere else then also do that. I personally, when I see a tattoo on women I think it hot besides those people who have a million tattoos. It makes them look tough and it already shows they are unique and have character.|`|fMPuTA6Uaa	it's not a good idea b/c that part of your body moves a lot and it would get all wrinkly from stretching it|`|itoMF5nSaa	It depends on wat your gettin.. If u want something unique u should deff get a bow behind ur knee on both legs soo cute... That was an old idea of mine but I got sumthin way different

gmCdhK3aaa	I think it's fine! Every morning I wash my hair, blow dry it, brush it a lot, then straighten it, then occasionally tease it. My hair is still beautiful. So if you simply brush it nothing bad will happen. What are you going to do instead of brushing it? I don't think you should worry. :)|`|S1QC1q9taa	yes, its damaging, not as much as blow drying, straightening, or dying it though|`|bzMJrpjVaa	No..  depends on how you brush ur hair.  But indeed, brushing ur hair as many times as possible will improve your scalp circulate.  But it all depends on how u brush ur hait,  just genteelly brushing will be good!

Mula85EKaa	Well it called a cover up by brushing ove the thin area of the hair and thats usally why some pull it in a pony to hide the bald spot Yes it looks fine if its not directly on the crown the it looks like a comb over  with a bald and thin pony ukk.|`|x7RAnrLgaa	aliens steal it|`|P8dIznazaa	The thing is, the part of the scalp that's most vulnerable to mail-pattern baldness is right on top--especially in back and front.  That's why you see a lot of guys with a high forehead and/or with a bald spot in back.  In those who have it worse, the baldness creeps over the whole of the crown.  In worst-case scenarios, you're looking at guys who are completely bald.  But most men are one of the first two.  I'm in the first category--high forehead, creeping around up top (but still have lots of hair there), and a bald spot in back.    Ben Franklin was in the second group: he got completely bald up top, but the hair around was ok.  He just let it grow.  Baldness isn't something that shortens hair to zero--it causes follicles to not grow at all, and what happens is the degree of male-pattern baldness you have determines how many follicles stop growing (and in which places).  My forehead gets especially high on the left side, for instance.  (Why do you think I wear a hat in my avatar? ;) )|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	Hair falls out at the root, regardless of how long it is.    What actually happens, though, is that as the roots get weaker each new hair gets thinner and shorter than the last one until they stop being replaced at all.

gmCdhK3aaa	If it's that bad of course you can use a straightener. If you want best results, go layer by layer and go slowly.|`|CgwEfwOZaa	ya you totally can.  Heat does wonders.  Just make sure you invest in a type of creme or spray pre-straightening to protect your hair from any damage.|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	Just wash it once a day, the curls will drop.    I wouldn't use a straightner, it could damage your hair really badly.    Seriously, just wait a few days and they will drop and become big.|`|Ej5sEPxgaa	I feel you frustration! My hairstylist did the same thing once. I recommend no straightening, yet at least. Wash your hair out first, dry it and all that, then straighten it. Trust me, from experience I know it works.
Mula85EKaa	Yes it does and I would say probally just use a flat iron on the hair until it relaxes down mopr to save on the damage unless  your hair is strong enough to take it.  You probally can get by with the straightner but it does damage the hair some.|`|qKIeshVWaa	it will probably still smell from all the chemicals. also it'll damage your hair so badly, and wont go completely straight. i advise letting it grow out, just use a straightener until it does, making sure you use heat protector.
Mula85EKaa	Black hair is hard to bleach out you end up alot of times with orange or bright big bird yellow .  I would say use 30 vol and .  The fact that your hair gets dry is because it probally is a little curly or you float iron your  hair  and in that case maybe try to go to professional for the best results and get what you really want .. Best of luck it is posible and it will look  cute.|`|Z91L7utraa	http://learntrickshere.blogspot.com|`|F9tGALBiaa	well, when i bleached my hair, i used manic panic white lightning. it worked pretty well. and their other colors look amazing too. Manic Panic is all i use, and my hair has not gone frizzy at all.  If you leave it in for like maybe, oh say, fifty-ninety minutes, it might be pure white, or a dull grey, but hey, if you dye it pink, it'll still turn out pink ^^ ( maybe a different shade than you want though...)
5xyP8ejHaa	Locks of Love? That's great! Good for you.  As another user suggested, try to stay away from heat products. And if you do, use heat protection.   This means, do not fry your hair by straightening it every day.  Get the ends trimmed every once in awhile.   I've heard protein foods are very good for hair. So uhm, eat eggs? XD|`|GO938Avuaa	well, you could start by not using heat products. but if its something you can't stop doing you could use a heat protecter that is pretty cheap at most drugstores and also you can do other things like deep condition your hair twice a week (garnier has a great deep conditioner) also, when your hair is wet, never use a brush, use a comb instead because when your hair is wet it is more fragile.     good luck & hope I helped.

aLzymSxraa	To me, tattoos are supposed to symbolize something. It's supposed to be significant to you, your life, how you treat others, etc. So if the angel wings are your way of saying that you like to treat others nicely or that you love god then it would fit you. But if you are insufferable to others and got it as a cheap ploy with no real depth  or personal meaning to you then it would be a terrible idea.     Remember! Tattoos are forever so when you finally get it, make it count!|`|mGQOgjeYaa	no|`|MzIDFWYPaa	Yesss I was thinking about getting that tattoo i think there cute & symbolize a good thing C=|`|YqdU6SS6aa	Extremely tacky, IMHO.

Be original.|`|0VBESmFQaa	First off there are way to many tattoo haters on here. But i understand that you can't deal with the pain so i forgive you,I understand that it is your job to hate while the rest of us enjoy watching you do so and laugh about it any chance we get, And as far as your question go's i think that if it makes you feel more sexy to have them then get them, I think they look good on some women, Depends on the style you want,My advice is go to a very good artist and have him draw it on you first until you like what you see and make it yours and not what you have seen,Good luck !|`|Jo8HXGu1aa	NOPE..but they are un-original!    * would rather f*ck an average mediocre looking chick than a hot tatted up one ANYDAY!

DHdK3vVoaa	If there is an inherent and discernible flaw, I would keep pressing them.  After all, you made an investment in a suit that you'll wear for years to come.  It needs to look presentable.
xzNr2RmIaa	You start with the size your hole already is..  Depending on where you got pierced it could be anywhere from 20-16, maybe even 14.  Then you go up sizes from there. It takes time and a ton of money.  The smallest size of those that they have are 2's. You're pretty far away from that.  For the really small sizes you don't need tapers, you can usually just get the jewelry in. Then once you're at like a 10 you can use pinchers until they get too big for your liking, then you can use tapers to get to the size you want.    Like I said, it take money and time.      PS it's called stretching not gauging.|`|eb924f26e87854a988885867d7de96acaa	Those are plugs, not tapers.
hd7J2aoNaa	why do you even have one??  [Pro-Sarcasm?]|`|U7vLYGodaa	congrats! thats by far my favorite piercing!    Once the swellling goes down you should be able to go to your piercer and downsize, thats what ive done with all my facial piercing and theyve turned out fine. as long as theres no more swelling you should be able to change them.|`|mGQOgjeYaa	your hot|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	You should be able to switch to a smaller barbell in a month or so. Once your swelling is completely and utterly gone and has been gone for a few weeks. The last thing you want is to change your barbell early and then have your cheek get angry and swell up so tightly that you can't get the jewelry changed back.     Cheek piercings are thick, heavy duty piercings so they do take longer than the average to heal. They're also very sensitive piercings that love to swell when they aren't perfectly happy. So give your cheek plenty of time to settle down before you go switching to shorter jewelry.     You'll know that your cheek piercings are healed the same way you can tell any piercing is healed. Once you think it has healed, stop cleaning it like it's new. If it doesn't develop any lymph crust, then it's healed. Regardless of being healed, cheek piercings can be quick to close. So, if you need to take them out for a few hours, a retainer might be a worthy investment.

YnG0Tjxjaa	As long as she keeps it very clean she should be alright. It is quite the change, and it's not the best idea. I would go gradually. Wearing what size for two weeks? 18? Maybe go from an 18 to a 10... wait about a month, and go from a 10 to a 4. With the assistance from a professional piercing shop of course. Make sure you keep it very sanitary. That's my suggestion, but I would definitely ask someone on a professional standpoint.|`|VnOnxZcyaa	Well, Shed Stop gagging if you 2 didn't have 3sums all the time|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	i didn't know someones ear could stretch that fast and personally i think the things that actually stretch your ear (the "earring") looks cooler than gauges, btw it's gauging not gaging

UoAZzwacaa	You should expect some pus, swelling, and redness with any new piercing. This is nothing to worry about as long as you clean the piercing at least three times a day as directed by your piercer. Pus just means that your body is doing its job, healing a wound and fighting off infection. You shouldn't worry too much unless there is excessive swelling or pus, or the pus is off color or has blood in it.     Remember that all piercings are basically injuries, and the healing process takes time and patience. Take good care of your piercing, and go immediately to your piercer if you have any problems.|`|pHNtYjyvaa	I got mine pierced before. It acted the same, and I went to the dr and they said it HAD to come out. I fought for it for a while, but it was not worth it. I had it taken out, shots and everything for that thing. I just got it redone later, but was only able to because I'd gotten it taken care of so fast.  If you don't want to go to the dr right away, which you should, then seriously, right now! use some sea salt on it. Clean that really well, and keep all objects/hands/hair/lotions/food/drink/an... away from it. It can end up baad if not properly taken care of. And using hydrogen peroxide is a common thing, but it's too drying. Use antibacterial ointment around it too, really get it under there, no matter how much it hurts. Just be gently and slow, no rushing it. It'll just irritate it. And wash it with pure soap too. No fragrance or anything.|`|V3adr5MYaa	take some ibuprofen for the swelling.    mix up some sea salt and water and heat it up in the microwave. use a q-tip to clean the inside and outside around the piercing.    use a soaked cotton ball and set it on the outside and let it sit for a few minutes. do this a few times a day.    you can do some sea salt water mouth rinses too.
Kh5o3QCcaa	I used Nivea 'Q10 Plus' lotion after my first pregnancy, and all through-out my second and it has helped a ton with my stretch marks.  Honestly I have not found a better lotion.

A0nRQHDCaa	I think this is a question for women who have stopped waxing their eyebrows for many years.  I havn't stopped waxing for a year and I'm sure many women who do havn't either..    Anway they would just grow back how they were in the first place...they would not be neat...that's why we waxed them in the first place.|`|8osMkLe1aa	I have waxed for about 6 years and mine still grow back exactly the same. My mom has waxed her eyebrows so many times that the areas she waxed off don't grow in any more. So they actually end being more neat because they'll look like you got them waxed even though you didn't.|`|PEKgLXBZaa	they grow back like thicker and the hairs are darker

(bonus points for knowing more than one of the above)  do you regularly smoke cigarettes and/or pot and/or drinking heavy amounts of hard liquor regularly and/or do blow often?  are you suicidal because sparks is gone?  do you shower less than once a day?  do you own a street bike, which you ride frequently?  do you have disdain for adult-type work situations?  are you, did you, or have you ever considered attending some sort of art program?    if you answered yes to most of these, you are free to get this cut.  and you should probably call me.|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	Eww no!

xdeWSxJ4aa	The fact that you made that prom dress with your own pattern is amazing. I wish I had that skill! I think your designs are very cute, but basic. If I went to a specialty dress store, I'd want to know I was getting a one of a kind (when I say one of a kind, I mean from a designer with a particular, unique style to them, not necessarily the ONLY dress in that style haha).    I recommend that before you open a dress shop, definitely check out courses at design institutes. You'll refine your basic skills, as well as pick up some new ones, particularly with pattern making.    I wish you the best of luck, I think you have a good future down this path =D|`|oVNAPhyWaa	Those dresses are really sexy yet not trashy! Hard to find that lately.I really think the second dress (baby blue) is very cute and professional looking. The last sundress is also really nice. You have skill and if you really put your head into it and plan properly you could have a small successful dress shop. But make sure you are really prepared to open a business and have everything planned out to the dot. I really like your designs!|`|M9tH99gfaa	yeh i like the dresses i think you could at least give it a try =]|`|aV0QmAOtaa	Well the first link is not working for me and the second dress looks pretty fair to me. Did you really make your own prom dress? If you did, let me tell you it looks a lot cuter than what I see on the rags of department stores. It's very cute and I love the shoulder/bow detail. I'm going to be honest and say you probably do have a shot as long as you're really dedicated to it. If you know how to make clothes, that's a far start from where many people are right now, and I'm sure fashion programs/institutes would take you in because you seem like you have experience.    best of luck to you and your talent :)|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	They're beautiful, you have some talent.    Maybe if you took a few classes you would be even better.    Even though you're already really good.    Have you tried making sundress' with patterns?    I'd like to see how good you are at those. Sundress' are my fave.    I don't sew tho. haha. I just love them. |`|0WFkwdYsaa	You have a really good thing going on there,,,,I think you can make just about any thing .. And to answer your question I would definitely buy your clothes..     You have got talent girl, Go out and there and do your thing.|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Holy sh*t. The first dress (new link) is sexy!    The blue dress is very pretty :)    Your prom dress is gorgeous, but thanks to your date we can't see much! Good on him! Being too interested in you! Geez! :P    And the Sun dress... well, let's just say, if you had a shop open now I would buy that from you :)    I think after a while, and after being noticed, you opening a little shop of your own could be a very good investment.    Good luck! :)|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I think you have a raw talent for this :)     Although, I think if you took some classes you could be twice as good and could seriously open up a dress shop. I'd buy your prom dress xD

f23214a41372089961827734a54a4ed3aa	Use some good products on your hair. John Frieda makes shampoo, conditioner, serum formulas, gel, etc. that help smooth and straighten hair and they are not as pricey as the ones from salons. You can find them at Target or drug stores.<br>    Use a blow dryer on your wet hair with a tightly bristled brush. After you get it dry, keep your hair pulled straight with te brush and blow cool air on it. Cooling it well help it stay straight.<br>    Personally, I like curly or wavy hair on guys. Plenty of fellows have straight as a stick hair. So you might just get a cut and style that works with your hair and accentuate the positive. I bet your hair looks good. : )|`|b9340d55ca2eafabefe3208ac2cb2e89aa	The avatars have don't my style either . so I just go with what I have had in the past or what I'd like to have.

9VB4uWhMaa	You can use it on your face as a natural astringent.  One part apple cider vinegar to six parts water.  You can also make a mask out of apple cider vinegar and cornstarch.|`|oVNAPhyWaa	My sister does this treatment. She drinks it in the morning because when she puts in on her face the smell gets really strong and in the workplace or school it can be unpleasant. So drinking is better. It actually works. Her face is really clear and way better. Her pimples and zits slowly went away. I refused to drink it because it tastes like feet and its horrible but it is quite benefiting if you regularly do it.
dc0d18fce43f3e33fe9ba117ad249538aa	MAC Blot is the best.  I would not use anything with cornstarch, since it can aggravate acne.  Using blotting papers to absorb extra oil and then touching up with powder is the best plan...better to remove the oil than let it sit on your face!|`|381c7e71be712d31211631294cd8e8bfaa	MaryKay has an oil-mattifier lotion that keeps you skin from being oily.

ygyBx1Xhaa	Wash your face somewhat gently with baking soda and water. The baking soda scrubs off the dead skin cells gently. Rinse it off. Then take vinegar (preferably apple cider vinegar) and mix it with water. Then put on your affected area. Should clear right up, if you do it every day or so. Drink lots of water to flush the toxins out of your system.    Do not use toothpaste or Listerine, and don't squeeze!|`|NqZFw3izaa	aspirin..  crush one or two up with a drop of water and make a paste.. put it on before bed and leave it on all night..  it should at least smaller after a day or two..|`|889bdf746f8db41a658d481702371e15aa	Dap some toothpaste on it before you go to bed and leave on for the night.

For instant, is it because of the menstrual cycle which is the effect of the hormones. Evening prime rose oil is very good in this case.    If a pimple just pop out without any reasons, then OXY 5 or OXY 10 can be apply on that particular pimple and not the whole area. It is a strong medicine. This product is used to dry up the pimple very quick and the redness will be reduced.|`|8irbUx4eaa	it sounds really weird, but i swear ice and advil do the trick. leave the ice on as long as you can take and it will dry out that pimple|`|vDjy1eKDaa	when i used to have pimples, id just use my fingers and pop them.

Also, if you take 17 to exit 130, there's the Woodbury commons outlet center. <br>  Speaking of Outlets:  Eastern Long Island (Riverhead) has the Tanger outlets as well.  Western LI has Roosevelt Fields (off the Meadowbrook), it's like the largest mall in NY.<br>  If you are shopping in NYC, there are places everywhere of course!  I like Herald Sqaure the best (around 34th and 7th).

qCPnoKy2aa	MAC tends to have limited colors in their pigments quite often and sometimes don't have some of the colors for long at all. It did probably get discontinued.

GHegLJdOaa	I am also african american and my hair looks amazing every day...even if i dont go to the salon...which i must add that i havent gotten touched up in five months now and my hair still looks great and straight.        for one, use which ever shampoo and conditioner you like. Try to avoid the thich creams because they do no good for your hair.  next, you want to blow dry your hair out and comb and brush it at the same time. it is always a good idea to use a thin comb while combing and blow drying for the roots of your hair.     next, you want to use any brand of olive oil hair spray...spray this all through your hair,...but be sure not to make it tooo oily.     then, straighten your hair in small pieces...usually i work from the sides...and then do the back last.      when you are finished...try blow drying it but on a cold setting rather then hott and brush through it as you blow dry...only do this for a minute or so.      then to top it off, spray a little more olive oil sheen over it...      if this doesnt work for you, try asking your hair styleist what products he or she is using    good luckkkk =]|`|JzTg0hg5aa	go buy the shampoo and conditioner that they use at your salon and I dont really know what brand my straightener is so sorry about that.      good luck [:

Overall its just not a good idea... I think its a better look to go darker than your natural hair color. It brings out a lot of features rather than washing them out with blonde hair (that goes for people who arent naturally blonde). Thats just my opinion, but do what you want =)|`|6e830690f6672be530ebf4bcce2bd69baa	Its all about what you like.|`|28c59e9a508d7be51f5893dfd54a6ddcaa	u need to go to a parlour yeah -rita|`|648e035fad2d3b28cde0e0ad7508dbb5aa	I am not sure what "medium" olive completion looks like but if you are between caramel and dark mocha,  #ell no blonde is not for you.

If your natural hair color is blond or close to blonde, you can pull off almost any blonde color. <br>  <br>  If you hair color isn't close to blonde, the best you can do is a dark blonde, almost brown, or you'll look washed out.<br>  <br>  If you have darker skin but have your heart set out on blonde, I would start out at a dark blonde and see if that works. If it does, then go one shade lighter everytime you dye until you get where you want....|`|84a6b7dba78db28f085b2e8e39f848a5aa	isnt jessica alba kindof an olive complexion? and she went blonde. maybe do highlights instead to brighten up ur hair.
K8blUjQJaa	First, the breasts are mainly fatty tissue.  There is little that anyone can do to firm up the fatty tissue.  However, developing the muscles under the breasts will do wonders to improve the appearance of the entire upper body, including the breast area.    The "pecs" are the underlying support for the breasts.  A good toned set of pecs gives the breasts a higher, firmer appearance.  Push-ups are good to help build up the pectoral muscles.   She doesn't have to do a full man-style push-up to benefit, either.  Modified push-ups work just fine, and she can start with those.  Instead of extending her legs all the way back and rising on the balls of her feet, she can simply start with her legs in a kneeling-forward position and rise from her knees instead.  As she gains strength, she can advance to traditional push-ups.  Or, she can start using a raised grab-bar to increase the intensity.    Another great exercise is the chest press, either flat or inclined.  I recommend both, as they work different muscle fibers.    For the flat chest press, lie faceup on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand.  Your wrists should be in a neutral position, palms facing forward, elbows bent 90 degrees and held out to the sides parallel with shoulders. Exhale as you extend your arms toward the ceiling with knuckles facing up, being careful not to touch the weights together, and squeezing your pectoral (chest) muscles at the top of the movement. Inhale as you return to the starting position.   The inclined chest press is similar, except that you lie faceup on an inclined bench at a 45-degree angle.  As the exercise becomes easier, increase the weight and/or add more reps.    If she wants to use machines, she can do cable cross-overs, lateral pulldowns help the latissimus dorsi-- a back muscle, yes, but vital to good back strength and posture.  Good posture helps the breasts to appear more pronounced.  Simply standing up straight makes things look firmer.    If she likes to swim, the breast stroke and the butterfly are both excellent for the pecs and the shoulder muscles (delts).  I like to do laps using only my arms with both of those strokes.    And, don't forget to work the abs.  Keeping the abs toned adds to the overall firm appearance.  Sit-ups, crunches and similar exercises are good for this.|`|AlZPIAtmaa	You are in an enviable position my friend.    Figure out what you want to do to her breasts and whatever it is, that is what firms them up.    You lucky dog you!|`|s4iVl04raa	Exercises that firm your pectoral muscles will help firm your breasts.

The Modified Push Up       1. Lie on your stomach, bend your knees, and cross your ankles. Bend your elbows and place your palms on the floor a bit to the side and in front of your shoulders. Straighten your arms and lift your body so you're balanced on your palms and knees. Tuck your chin a few inches toward your chest so your forehead faces the floor. Tighten your abdominals.       2. Bend your elbows and lower your entire body at once. Rather than trying to touch your chest to the floor, lower only until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Push back up. Don't lock your elbows at the top of the movement and don't do the dreaded "head bob." That's when you dip your head toward the floor without moving any other part of your body.        2. Soup Can Press         1. Lie on your back with your feet flat on the floor and a soup can or dumbbell in each hand. Push the soup cans up so your arms are directly over your shoulders and your palms face away from you. Pull your abdominals in but don't jam your back into the floor; don't let it arch way up, either. Tilt your chin toward your chest.         2. Lower the soup cans down and a little to the side until your elbows lightly touch the floor. Push the weights back up, taking care not to lock your elbows or allow your shoulder blades to rise off the floor. (Note: Use soup cans of equal weight. When those get too light, you can fill two Pinesol bottles with dried beans or pebbles.)        3. Incline Fly         1. Lie on the floor with your head, neck and upper back propped up against several large pillows. Hold a soup can or dumbbell in each hand and press the weights directly above your chest, palms facing each other. Tuck your chin to your chest to align your neck with the rest of your spine, and maintain your natural back posture, neither arched nor flattened.         2. Spreading your arms apart so that your elbows travel down and to the sides, lower the weights until your elbows lightly touch the floor. Maintaining a constant bend in your elbows, lift the weights back up, imagining that you have a barrel lying on your chest and you have to keep your arms wide to reach around it.    I hope this would by useful to your girlfriend.|`|pZqigkH9aa	Breastique is just the best for this!!  works so quick too  you can buy it online at www.pelvicfloorsolutions.com.au they mainly do exercisers for toning the pelvic floor and kegel exercisers but the cream works a treat.  good luck
vxc0NwMSaa	Not sure about the gelatin thing but prenatal vitamins supposedly work really good--and they are now over the counter.|`|Padoksv4aa	No. Your body will not absorb all of the gelatin. Most will pass through your system.  You are better off with a healthy diet and perhaps some vitamins if you are lacking something in your usual diet.  Good luck!|`|EeThBc3Zaa	It's just protein.  Nothing special about it.  If your diet wasn't deficient in protein, I can't see how it would make any difference.|`|AA11091233	No. It is better to take Silica from a health food store.    The other much better way is to have 3 different types of shampoo/conditioner...and every time you wash your hair, use a different shampoo especially. There is also a new Pantene shampoo to help your hair grow longer. I use Mark Anthony products..as they are inexpensive, yet come in many different kinds, yet I am switching it up...I have dry curly hair..so one day I use the moisturizing shampoo, 2 days later the shampoo for curly hair, 2 days later the shampoo for dry hair. I always use an excellent conditioner and a leave in conditioner too.      Good luck......hope this helps..|`|Yue2YKTnaa	no..|`|zefyHPApaa	you hearsd wrong
FW93xc6Raa	I'm not exactly sure of the gauge size of a standard lobe piercing, but the easiest way (outside of getting it professionally done -- which I suggest doing instead of doing it on your own) is to go down 1 gauge size at a time.  If it is truly a size 14g for standard lobe piercing go to a 13, then wait a while, then 12, wait a while, and so forth.  I don't believe if you change your mind though, that they will attach again.  Especially if you go down to such a large gauge size.
muHctmaGaa	There's an old short film from a series run on HBO called Lifestores about anorexia. With Calista Flockhart, actually. The full title is "the Secret Life of Mary-Margaret: Portrait of a Bulimic." In high school, she starts modeling catalog jobs and learns tricks from her co-workers, deals with the dichotomy of you look sick/you look great, and uses her job as an excuse to stay out and not eat. It's not as focused on the fashion as it is her eating disorder, but it's very good for a glorified after school special.    "Killing Us Softly" is a documentary more about women's bodies and the implication of thinness/eating disorders in advertising, not fashion, but it's well regarded.|`|M9tH99gfaa	the devil wears prada? i guess its kinda about fashion...i dunno exactly wot u need tho lol|`|DHdK3vVoaa	"America the Beautiful" is a documentary about a model who is struggling with anorexia.

L3j2HrsJaa	Ok, I understand. Don't worry about funny comments.   I'd like to be really pale myself. I just look better with naturally light skin as oppose to tanned. The problem is I tan easily. So I tried applying lemon juice on my face twice a day, leaving it for 30 min and rinsing with warm water, then applying rich moisturizer because lemon is drying. And it makes you skin very sensitive to the sun, so I put spf 100 from Bioderma every day. Then I tried some lightening creams with kojic acid and arbutin, again with spf 100 sunblock. Some worked better than the others. I also had dark melasma patches on my forehead and chin. I never dared to try hydroquinone, it's dangerous and banned in many countries.  Now, after about a year of trying it all, this is my conclusion:  Lemon juice worked the same or even better of all and is cheap. I spend a fortune on this creams and as soon as I stopped using them, my tan and melasma came back. What I'm doing now?   I put pure lemon juice in the evening on a clean face, leave it for half an hour, rinse with warm water and put some moisturizer. I scrub my face every second day with Vitamin C Body Shop's microdermabrasion cream to remove dead cells. It's genle end effective. And still wear my Bioderma spf 100 sunblock. It makes a huge difference. It took a long time, but my face is now naturally lighter (not pale, it's in the genes), more evenly toned and really smooth and glowing.  So I'm afraid there is no quick way to lighten your skin! But there is a way to make it slightly lighter and glowing. Good luck!|`|1frcThISaa	pharmdcougargal (hope i got that right :P lol) is actually right about moving to alaska, i live in alaska and, well i was already pale to begin with, but now im like...REALLY pale lol. idk why youd want to be pale, but it flatters me cuz usually everyone thinks pale is gross|`|6qnadDHyaa	please tell me this is not related to that stupid twilight crap|`|xTaE8GLUaa	Stay out of the sun and use sunblock!!

My friend says your a:  3 1/2  I say your girl friend's a: 1000000000000000000000  average it out comes to above 10|`|8kOyJjZAaa	You're both 6/10.  you're girlfriend couldn't have taken a more sluttier picture. eww. i'm blind.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	You both are 8's on a scale of 1-10 and 10 being the highest best.    You are american/french, indian possibly irish or scottish    She is swedish or german|`|kauRr6X8aa	You 4.  Her 7.|`|g2h6cgcvaa	you look maybe maltese or italian...  7/10 both.  she is mayeb irish?|`|817cba953d47b19d42283b382144cae4aa	you 5/10  her 7/10|`|GHlYbDfJaa	I give you both 7/10|`|cXRRP6ttaa	i think u may do better w/different hairstyle.  u - 6  gf - 6.3  umm, sweden?|`|tg6bqGgcaa	I say she's Irish.  She looks like my friend and my friend is Irish.  You are a mixture of French, Italian, and Polish.  Those are my guesses. =]|`|bOduFl9Baa	I'm not gay so i don't rate guys, but I'd guess you were Japanese and your girlfriend is a 6/10 and I would have to say Morrocan|`|5GWzRFc4aa	10 being the best? Hmm..I sau you're about a 6 1/2 and your girlfriend is an 8.....    you look.....Russian? haha erm......either Russian or French, possibly German...or Canadian...    and your girlfriend looks...I would say Russian, Canadian, or Swedish|`|OodkdbdDaa	id probably say you are a 5.     she is like an 8.5 though. i think shes beautiful.|`|ESAVdvdxaa	It say a 6.5 to both.    Anyway isnt it kinda bogus to ask your rating?? Showing off is not the way to go mate.
AA11217207	Your earlobe is much more valuable then a few bucks of gold wire. Still don't cut it, if you do that you will probably wind up with a small bit in your ear that will be near impossible to get out.    Also most starter earrings are not made to be taken out and reused. It's expected that you will probably toss them.     I'm not exactly sure how it is stuck. If your ear healed onto the wire your options are fairly limited. If it's just a small bit of flesh that has healed onto it then you can probably take it out yourself and only experience a small amount of pain and no complications. Remember to clean the wound as well as whatever earring you intend to put in it's place. (I mentioned the starter earrings are usually not used after they have served their initial purpose so you mush have another pair of "real" earrings)    The second possibility is that you mean you cant get the back off the earring so you can take it out of your ear. In this case cutting the back off may be the best option. (since you wont be wearing them again scrap gold is valued by weight which is the same if it's in one piece or 3) Sometimes they get jammed and can usually be pulled off with a bit of finger strength. Sometimes they are bent and might need a bit more finesse. Either way you might want to get someone to help since they can see behind your ear better then you can. Just make sure they know better then to rip the earring out of your ear.     If the earlobe is red, inflamed or especially sensitive to touch you probably have a minor infection and should seek medical help before it becomes a major infection.    PS: I am assuming you have waited and fully healed as per the instructions you got when you got your ears pierced.    PPS: Gold is a very soft metal especially the more pure it is. Are you using actual wire cutters or something like sissors?|`|aLzymSxraa	Not sure but you should ask yourself, what is worth more? looking decent or having the thing in one piece?    It's times like this that one realizes that they may not be able to find the middle ground they are looking for and will have to sacrifice one path for another.|`|5GWzRFc4aa	Ooh that sucks. That happened to me when I was in 2nd grade a loooong time ago and I couldn't figure out how to get it off until like a week later so it got infected >__    Clean it well just in case with Bactine or some disinfectant and then have someone pull the backing off really fast while you hold the earring in place so they don't rip it out of your ear haha. You *could* do it yourself, but it might be harder. Hope I helped, good luck :]
FbpKEMS5aa	wear a makeup primer.  You can get some at sephora.com  One of my faves is "Clean slate" by tarte and smashbox had a number 1 selling primer in several diff colors or clear.  You put it on over moisturizer and under foubdation.  Keeps face makeup on all day|`|AA12133586	use primer before foundation and a loose powder after foundation|`|AaYEgDwWaa	That happens to me, you need a primer|`|YT4bBWwVaa	either wear primer or spray hair lacquer (hair spray) on your face, quite lightly though so your face doesn't go shiny|`|oIUNvpYFaa	Oh god I had the same problem, SOOOO mortifying! I use both silicone primer (Smashbox photo finish) and spray a mix of witch hazel/ hair spray after applying my foundation and before powder. :)|`|r2gIyNKCaa	I honestly don't think there is a way to prevent that from happening unfortunately. If we wear foundation it will rub off sorry.
2jMFurDoaa	well it makes sense to bleach it then cut it  because the bleach will fry your hair.    if you cut it first your gonna have more deadness on the ends opposed to bleaching it first|`|SEXRn1R3aa	Cut your hair first. You'll be wasting extra product by bleaching unwanted hair. Just does not make any sense.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	u could bleach it first since bleach is so damaging, especially to the ends, then cut it to get rid of some of the damage, that  would be best if ur ust cutting a little bit, but if your cutting alot off then y waste time and product on hair u are going to cut?|`|AsCQhy9Uaa	Get it bleached first. Then you can get rid of the split ends.|`|YT4bBWwVaa	i think the sensible way it to cut it before dying it, because you don't want to be dying hair you don't need to,  x|`|EzAElWADaa	bleach it first them cut it when your hair is wet.  thats what i do
J4UXuH2jaa	try the Cinnamon and honey drink. you can lose up to 5 pounds a week.     you don't have to change what you eat, you just ave to drink half cup in the morning and half cup after dinner.     sounds too good to be true right? that's what i thought, but i tried it and it was great.     good luck =]|`|Z5Wm6lWFaa	About the weight thing. I would say the best thing to do is eat less fatning food BUT eat MORE of healthy foods. I work for a hair salon, so YOU KNOW there alot of poeple who are concerned about health and weight.    THe best thing to do is snack every two hours eating healthy stuff.. tuna with wheat crackers, fruit, yogurts and stuff like that. EAT MORE OFTEN of healthy food during the day to keep your metabolism going. Insted of eating a few oreo's brownies any sweet stuff and fatning things subsitute it with something else healty.. you tend to loose more weight snacking healthy foods then even straving yourself all day.  You also will feel alot better. Ive been doing the little snacking things and lost like 4/5 lbs in like 2 weeks...    About your marks.. you can go to ma and buy the spray on stuff they have.. it covers well. not that i use it for stretch marks but i know alot of poeple that use it for a much stronger cover up.|`|IzYq6p3Naa	A good place to start with losing weight is here:     http://www.the-perfect-solution.com/fat....    Requires no exercise or diet, but it's a good start.     Once you've done that, then start eating less and exercising more.|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	Really, the key is eating less (1200calories and less than 30g fat) and just exercise. It doesnt have to be like ridiculous and sign up to the gym blahblah~ you can just lift 5lb & 10lb dumbells, go out for walks, get a yoga dvd and do it at home. You can drop 10lb in a month.. I realize you dont have a month, but since you asked the question late, you gotta work with the time you have.   For stretch marks, you can use like concealer and foundation.|`|9VB4uWhMaa	If your boyfriend doesn't mid your weight then you shouldn't either.   If your wearing something sexy I serious doubt he'll even see your stretch marks.    Have fun and don't worry!|`|r7I7FoNMaa	Eat less, exercise more.    Eat salads with grilled chicken - no dressing and fruit.  Fat free cottage helps get needed protein in.
tmOphHyRaa	You know whats funny is that last part just totally tells about your personality which makes you not pretty in my eyes. If you knew you were "hot" you wouldn't be on here saying your single looking for guys online and you wouldn't be asking everyone if you were cuter then your friends. Your obviously insecure about how you look??? Good luck with that|`|WTf21t9Jaa	You're all really pretty in your own way.  Why does it matter anyways?  What matters if how you think of yourself. You shouldn't care what other people think of you. As long as YOU think you're pretty, it's all good:)    You seem more natural though(stylewise).|`|XbzXOI4Xaa	Ur the best looking and NO i am not just saing b/c ur the one asking lol    ANSWER MINE???  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Tessa  Sam  You|`|kauRr6X8aa	Tessa, Ashley, Sam.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	i think tessa is really cute but your dimples are a bonus too :)|`|5WtXOl51aa	lol 2 looks like a stoner        "6 hours ago  and btw im single!!"  wtf  looking for love on the interwebs?...|`|Xd7mulQbaa	You are all cute.

WOW! FUll of yourself much.  Just to let you know guys find that unattractive.
jLaXM61Saa	none of the pics came up for me sorry!|`|Zki0DuLWaa	If I had to choose, I'd say deep set, but really, they have an average set. Lovely eyes though!|`|6zXpA0PNaa	Long, almond shape, and slightly heavy lidded. They look pretty to me, but sort of puffy in the 2nd pic. You were probably smiling, so that's normal.|`|lrazLb9daa	Protruding.
3WuBl014aa	First calm down...you'll be okay. You cannot put dye on top of dye. It won't take. So what you'll need to do is bleach out some of the black to get it to the desired shade. You can go to a local salon shop to ensure you purchase the correct bleach. Then redye it with the desired color. I would suggest that because this is such a testy procedure that you invest in having a professional do it. But that's just a suggestion. Go to any Sally's beauty salon and talk with them. They can point you in the right direction with the correct bleach and dye. Good Luck!|`|aV0QmAOtaa	Just wait a few days and buy a lighter brown! If you bleach it, it will turn into an ugly orange color.|`|zxaqL885aa	i did the exact same thing. i wanted a shade darker then my hair colour which it would have turned dark brown. but it went black. don't dye the blonde over it. it will go a funny colour that you reeeeally wont want. go to the hair dressers and they will help it.  good luck  =D  P.S- if you are buying dye from a store again, take the dye out and make sure it is the right colour that you want. my hair dresser said that sometimes kids will mess around with the colours and mix the bottles up and stuff so you get a dye that you didn't want. just a little tip to help ya out   =D|`|yeYL8Udoaa	go to a hair stylist...    or cut all your hair..|`|8CPH9l0vaa	I did the same thing and after like probably a dozen washes it faded to be perfect! I didn't do anything except wash it daily.|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	Definitely don't put the blonde through.    It will fade, just wash your hair once everyday and it will fade in no time.|`|AA10558731	First of all, turn off your caps lock key. Far from conveying any sense of urgency, it just makes you appear to be more of a dufus than simply dying your hair black by mistake.    Next, wait for it to grow out while learning the fine art of patience. Deal with the snide comments from your friends, and resolve to never dye your hair again. Never. Ever. Learn to be happy with who & what you are.|`|eY4RubMSaa	Don't bleach over the black - it'll turn orange.|`|JQMajdtvaa	don't do anything to it for about a week.  dye always goes darker than you want.  you need to always buy a lighter color.    it should fade within the next week or so.  just keep washing it.    if not, you can get dye remover and then re-dye it after.|`|J6X14hWIaa	wash it alot, it will fade|`|Du6O1CrZaa	it will turn lighter but prolly even worse|`|0LibQ8Fyaa	use dishwashing SOAP in your hair now, that should take out as much of the extra dye as possible...then wait a few days (or however long it says to wait b/t dying) on the package, and use a lighter brown.|`|HHnQyjFBaa	That's what happens when amateurs use drugstore hair dyes. *sigh*
DzEXQ9Ydaa	I've seen hair cuts the way you are describing how you want yours to look.   I say go for it! I've always like it, but my face is too narrow for shorter dues..   But my motto is that hair can always grow back. You'll never know until you try!|`|aXRSlnWvaa	yeah, you can. It won't look exactly the same, but you can tell them to layer it from the back.. it still looks cool.    It would look horrible with really long hair, but with moderately long hair it looks really cool.|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	Go with the second one, that way it is still kinda long but not as long as you used to have it plus its really cute!|`|YqdU6SS6aa	No, not really. This cut needs to be short to work at all. It would just looked botched on long hair.|`|cXRRP6ttaa	im not sure if u can add layers to ur hair w/o looking incongruent.  i had a cut similar to this. its called a bob. i had a pic of kate bosworth.  i think u may have to compromise to touching ur shoulders rather than passed it.
YT4bBWwVaa	you could if you wanted to keep your hair long, but the whole effect with her hair that makes it look good, it the extreme difference between the few bits of hair at the front, and the short bits at the back.  xx|`|UhK363oJaa	yes you definety can//|`|UT94ygfAaa	Yeah just cut the back short and dont mess with the front
V3adr5MYaa	its normal.    mix up some sea salt and water and heat it up in the microwave. use a q-tip to clean the inside and outside around the piercing.    use a soaked cotton ball and set it on the outside and let it sit for a few minutes. do this a few times a day.    you can do some sea salt water mouth rinses too.|`|eb924f26e87854a988885867d7de96acaa	Yes, until the piercing is fully healed, clear discharge and crusties are normal.
AA12035477	definitely make-up enhances any girl's beauty and too much make-up takes away from her natural beauty,There are days when a little face powder and lip gloss or lipstick is sufficient and there are days when a girl needs to go all out! But true beauty comes from the inside and reflects on the outside.|`|K8PsgTs8aa	i think a girl just wears make up to look better/ a certain way.  but if a girl already looks like that naturally i wouldn't say she's prettier,  just luckier.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Depends on which girl|`|BBVfRheyaa	yup.    Pig is a pig.  Cow is a cow.  Sheep is a sheep.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	i look like sh!t without it  i look different with make-up|`|wyIccGvaaa	i look the same except people say i look high if i dont have eyeliner or mascara on because my eyes look really small LOL|`|a9TLbyqKaa	It depends on the girl. If your partner really loves you it won't matter|`|vFK8AjMcaa	Au naturale = Beauty|`|bvqz8Xh5aa	depends on the chick.|`|YqdU6SS6aa	I think it depends on the girl. But I think that everyone needs a little something. Whether it just be a little gloss, mascara,  and powder. It doesn't hurt! I have blonde eyelashes, so I don't go anywhere without mascara on!|`|8XDM4LvCaa	some look really beautiful without it and some needs to put some like eye liner or a lipstick -|`|EeQ6qL52aa	no she is hella fugly without it. Girls that look good without it are true beautys tho.|`|f5HT6Urraa	Looks, usually not. But to much make-up just makes you look shallow.|`|Xn9ELUeXaa	Generally I think the natural like is a lot better gives the girl the effect of being "down to earth" to others.    However, I really think it does depend on the girl because sometimes girls do look a lot better with make up. Example....most celebrities.|`|MEd22BHMaa	Yes.. she is more beautiful.... as long as she has "NATURAL BEAUTY"... UNDERNEATH ALL OF THE "FAKE-UP"|`|b4XYpID6aa	too much make up causes disaster. purpose of applying make up is to enhance ur features if u have beautiful eyes or nice cheekbones etc.|`|bG7a7QDtaa	i think it depends on the girl some girls are naturally pretty|`|4wXEtk8gaa	unless you have a birthmark or awful scar. most girls look best with lip gloss and mascara. your natural beauty is always what everyone notices.|`|lJPFlcOTaa	make-up does accentuate and enhance beauty, but some use make-up to cover up the unpleasant but then again it all depends|`|jNzSfH9Maa	I THINK BOTH I THINK THAT MAKEUP MAKES PEOPLE MORE POLISHED BUT I THINK NO MAKEUP ON *SOME PEOPLE IS JUST FINE
xSrOTcPZaa	I'll be honest...dont like the fabrics. I do like the first pair of shoes listed...open toe platforms can be hot.  Why not look at some patent leather?  Shoes make an outfit, so don't look into buying a quiet shoe because u will regret it and it will sit in ur closet 4 ever unused
tI7QP3dkaa	You could get a tuile underskirt that sits lower that the current hem.     Or make a underskirt of the same material rather than attach it to the dress    If you want the security ribbon straps would hold it make sure that you sew them on securely and you could even attach them to your bra.|`|A0nRQHDCaa	Ribbon straps would be lovely! I also think that a skirt of a different color(to the length you desire) like a midnight blue or purple ...or red or gold would give that dress an awesome pop! or a just sow on a different color to the end of the material of the same or similar fabric.    Gold or red if you want to be sophisticated look...    Blue/purple is you want it to look fun.|`|aXRSlnWvaa	I think ribbon straps would hold, but make sure to sew it on REALLY WELL because of the material. Also be careful what type of thread you use because it could rip... that would be really hard to fix (if it tears the material)
s5XNGbOMaa	Try using baking soda in your hair for 1/2 hour then blowdry it out. This usually works for me. If not, you might have to wash your hair everyday. Get a natural, clarifying cleansing shampoo without conditioner.|`|HRRfZDQqaa	buy a shampoo and conditioner just for oily hair|`|SIE3HuHRaa	Believe it or not, if you have so powder foundation, you can apply that to your bangs or what ever part of hair gets greasy most! Read it on Yahoo....it works for me! (you can also apply toothpaste on your zits for fast relief) I AM NOT KIDDING! lol :)|`|75cz9e5Kaa	Don't wash your hair every day,<br>  Or else you'll have to wash it EVERY day for like ever.<br>  This happened with me, I used to wash my hair every day and if I didn't one day my hair would be like a million times greasier.<br>  Try all those things that people say but it could just be puberty :)<br>  It'll pass I'm sure..<br>  It did with me :)<br>  <br>  In the meantime, but some dry hair shampoo, such as Batiste (I don't know where you live so that's probably pointless unless you live in the UK) for like ￡2 and just spray it on in the mornings. It really works :)<br>  <br>  Also, don't worry so much, greasy hair is always more obvious to you than other people :)|`|jON0SiApaa	I would suggest washing your hair every day.  Buy a shampoo and conditioner for oily hair. Also dont use other products, just the shampoo and conditioner, then wash it out well! how this works|`|WpPeydNaaa	BABYPOWDER|`|PT2ZSvpuaa	Try not to ever take a shower without washing your hair (shampooing it, conditioning it). I'm not sure if it's the same way for all people, but I definitly know that when I shower without shampooing, my hair ends up looking at least 30% more greasy than before.<br>  Along the lines of shampoo, you could try going to your local drug store or Walmart and looking for anti-grease shampoo. Head & Shoulders has many different kinds of shampoos (anti-dandruff, add-shine, anti-coarse), so you could check and see if they've got some anti grease.<br>  Shower, buy anti-grease shampoo, and if need be, brush some powder onto the top of your hair (or wherever it's greasy)! Some one else has mentioned it, but it works like a charm.

I am a Mexican American too. I have very white skin and almost black eyes. I love my eyes, I also like blue eyes, green eyes, and all the colors. But what makes them beautiful is their natural color.

rWsG4dilaa	yeah, that would probably look good on you. long hair is a little but more work than shorter hair... :-)
4Pzfqxqiaa	Blue..
AA11426538	Yep, to an extent.  The other answers are on the right track - shaving exfoliates that skin, fading your tan faster.  Our skin is shedding millions of dead skin cells a day, and in fact, most "dust" is actually dead skin.  Ew, right?  Here's how a tan works - your actually darkening a substance in your skin called melanin, which is like a UV light activated natural sunscreen, that rises to the surface of your skin when you're in the sun.  So, the longer those cells are exposed to the sun, the darker that melanin gets, and the deeper your tan.  Anyway, you can imagine that longer-tanned dead skin cells are darker than newer, less tan skin cells.  So, when as your dead skin cells slough off, your removing your oldest and, that's right, darkest melanin rich skin.  However, you can fight it by purchasing "tan-extending lotions" from a local tanning salon that will keep that melanin darker from longer.  They really do work, prolonging the chemical response in your skin that happens when that melanin takes in all that  (let's face it) totally unhealth UVA and UVB.  Pretty cool, huh?|`|2cadf90aa6e335ce81d62e8454d2b4b0aa	Yes, it exfoliates the skin off diminishing the tan faster.|`|73ce8f792cb8d424715cbd24afd37d9baa	Yes, its true. Each time you shave your legs you scrape off a thin layer of skin. This makes your tan fade.|`|AA11136125	No ,but it will make your leg hairs really really short.|`|c5057c1dd26ecb88c4a8b2f16f25e70aaa	I think it depends if its real or fake|`|AA11712934	yea, it exfoliates the skin and your tan only goes so far in the skin so it peels of little by little.|`|AA11856363	NO, IT WON'T REMOVE YOUR TAN BUT WHEN YOU SHAVE YOUR LEGS YOU ARE ALSO EXFOLIATING THE SKIN,WHICH IS YOUR ARE TAKING THE DEAD DRY SKIN OFF SO YOUR TAN MAY FADE A LITTLE BUT I DON;T BELIEVE SO..MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS USE A MOISTURIZER AFTER SHAVING AND AFTER SUN TANNING.|`|107e4bb3e33ae905f3dce441138c2c32aa	I wouldn't think that would be true... who would say that?|`|5d85aefc13fb767b4bd8616668a21b96aa	i think not because a tan is the color of your skin and does not have anything to do with shaving|`|AA11392579	Shaving your legs removes the outermost layer of dead skin cells, and with it some of the color of your tan, but the slightest bit, if noticable at all.  Waxing removes more, that's when you really see patches of a difference in color...  But it's actually healthier because your legs will glow as the outer layer of dead skin is usually dulling to your complexion anyway.|`|a4f3ad3cf7d2f646fcb3fa67f632494faa	i dont know, could be, could be not.

74f82c6d0e3fa74f3f6e72129cef8c15aa	Yes, the amount that your hair will shrink depends on the size of the perm rods used.  When you are in consultation with your hairstylist you should tell them exactly what you want.  Make sure that they know that you don't want really tight curls and that you want more of a body wave.  When you have your hair permed the curls will be a little tighter for the first few weeks until your hair relaxes a bit.  I would also suggest allowing your hair to grow a little more first.  If you have it permed at the length it is now the stylist might have to use smaller perm rods because your hair may be to short to wrap in the larger ones.|`|daf0fd31373ef11eb1743a126e33c000aa	depends on the size of the rollers your using

I mean labels aren't really that important. Dress how you want & like what you want. & it sounds like you're already as gothic as you can be & your parents haven't said anything yet. So whatever .. its a steriotype. Tell your family you aren't gothic & be what you want. No one knows if you are goth but you .. people can't tell by your interests what you are .. I like emo music & stuff but I'm preppy. Its better to be different & original .. then people can't label you. & you are cool.<br>  <br>  Hugs && Kisses<br>  ?

If you say you are, you aren't... I've been to nightclubs (18+) on "goth night" and the people there had some things in common, but there's no hard definition. People have labeled me as a goth, but I joked about it. I called myself a "Christian Goth" for a while because I went to church (I don't anymore) wearing fishnets, velvet clothes, and a spike collar. I had people tell me that I was going to Hell... which was quite amusing, actually.<br>  <br>  Why do you think that your parents won't accept you as you are? If you *try* to be (which you don't seem to be), that's one thing... it'd most likely be a phase. (There weren't emo kids when I was in highschool... I feel so old!)<br>  <br>  I find the gothic subculture to be interesting, but I don't consider myself to be a goth today... even though I still wear black, now have some piercings (I waited until I was 20 before I even had my ears pierced *LOL*) and have moments of depression. Some would call me a perkygoff (perky goth), but I think it's yet another label. The people at the clubs tend to try too hard and most kids who call themselves goth nowadays have never heard of Bauhaus or *rattles off a list of old-school goth bands* ...oh, and when I was in highschool, "goth" was public enemy number one because of Columbine (blamed on Marilyn Manson). The Manson followers are what were called "Spooky Kids" a.k.a. posers.<br>  <br>  Just for kicks, I'll give you links that talk about goth types. It's mostly a joke, but you'll find that "real goths" (people who don't try for the label) tend to have a similar sense of humor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sfgoth.com/primer/types.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgoth.com/primer/types.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.odk.com/wilson/goth/150.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.odk.com/wilson/goth/150.html</a>|`|58a030dbb03e159d7f9345bb4bb655ecaa	No, you're not.

They accepted me for who i was and was my friend because i accepted them for who they were.  Just accept yourself and everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  As for the parent issue, be glad they are their and care about you.  I've seen many family issues from divorce to... well some things i would rather not discuss.  Your family is just protective.|`|783fa34daf5db8bde0100e4f59c47603aa	Hahah well first of all I don't think you should try and label yourself, they only cause problems.

I'm just guessing.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you've got about 60 years, give or take, of life ahead of you. Do you really think that when you're 35, 45, 55, or 65, the label you had during high school is really going to matter? Trust me, it wont. <br>  Do you know what will matter?<br>  <br>  What you did, what you thought of yourself and what mattered to you. The rest of that BS is nothing after high school. You'll be someone else and it wont matter. You wont care about being goth, prep, emo, or whatever else the labels are. Naw, you'll care about different things.<br>  <br>  Okay now here is my advice.<br>  <br>  <br>  Think less about the NAME for who you are and more about WHO you are? Does it REALLY matter how you look, how you talk, or  or who you hang out with? No. What matters is what you do, what you say, and the relationship with the people that you hang out with that will matter. Seriously, think about it.<br>  <br>  Well, you may or may not care what I think, but just think about it, okay?<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way there is no real way to define what label you are because labels aren't real, don't matter, and are simply a close minded way of classification.<br>  <br>  Later,<br>  Amanda|`|AA11056035	you might be considered gothic by other people.. but you dont have to be like "hi im gothic".. you know? sounds kind of like you are, but you dont have to tell your family that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ten points?|`|ba80edcb97d7a01b74a15175e521baf7aa	It's very normal to be drawn to the style the people you hang with have. I mean, you're with them every day! You may like the way that looks and all, but that doesn't mean you have to become one or that you are one. Just be yourself, do what feels right to you. And think before doing stuff; are you going to regret it later on. Is this what you really want, or maybe it's just a phase you're going trough?|`|bc798e4c78f09343af08fdabe43d647faa	There's nothing wrong with it unless you turn into one of those dorks that goes overboard with it..

Just because you are attracted to this style doesn't mean you are.  If you dress that way and you act kinda cynical and people call you gothic...then you might be what is considered gothic.|`|e9f5704c6ddec3c7147985412602591faa	You may be gothic or you may just be weird (being weird isn't a bad thing in my opinion). I like all of the things you mentioned (I've had black hair, I'm pale as a ghost, I dig gothic style clothing and I love vampires) but I don't really see myself as gothic. Don't be so concerned with labels. If you like gothic things, you like them. It doesn't mean you are them if ya know what I mean. And as for the parents, I can understand why they would be more than a little concerned. The media has portrayed goths as suidical, angsty maniacs who worship Satan and want nothing more than to kill themselves and maybe take you out with them. Since you still live at home, I'd suggest not going overboard with the gothic clothing and whatnot. Afterall, your parents do have the final say in what you do and wear. Wait until college and then rebel :) If your parents are normal, they'll accept you and love no matter what you wear.

However if you're a woman it's just not possible too not use a flat iron or a hair dryer, try a heat protectant you can get them fairly cheap at drug stores.

I don't like the white shirt underneath though. I would put a stripped shirt underneath possibly a soft yellow or orange color.     Never never wear tenna shoes, sneakers with jeans when your wearing a nice sweater like that. You need casual dress shoes.     Also do not wear this sweater if you have any type of pudgy belly as it would not look good and would only accentuate your tummy. If your tone and tight then fine.

RGGcWvawaa	Go Light on the Conditioner.    Oily hair generally needs conditioning only on the ends. Choose a conditioner designed for oily hair and avoid applying it near the roots of your hair.    Discover the Power of a Vinegar Rinse.    Here's a trick for easy oily hair care. Mix a cup of water with a half cup of vinegar and apply it to your hair after your shampoo. It will reduce the build up of oil and give you hair additional bounce and body. Many women swear by this formula.    Clarify to Give Your Hair a Lift.    You should always have a clarifying shampoo available for oily hair care. Use your clarifying shampoo once a week to remove any additional sebum buildup and any remnants of hair products that can weigh your oily hair down and give it that limp, lifeless appearance.|`|4RsurY2xaa	change ur shampoo and conditioner..  apply henna..|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	Oh dear. I'm reading the advice you have gotten so far shaking my head.     Absolutely DO NOT use head and shoulders. First of all it really messes up your scalp. You will be itching if you are like half of the population who has ever tried it and gave it up. Head and Shoulders leaves a wax like consistency on your hair and is NOT at the correct ph level for healthy hair.     You need to find a good clarifying shampoo that is PH balanced and you will not find it on the shelf at a grocery store or Kmart. Go to a beauty salon. The best for you might be Artec Volume line texturizing shampoo. Follow with a good conditioner but only use it 2 inches away from your part or scalp not on the top of your head.     Next use a good hair spray. Spray it on your hands, rub your hands together and then through your hair at the roots. Or use Big Red volumizing mouse.     Keep your hair pulled back way from your face with barretts or clips.     Carry witch hazel on cotton pads in a baggie and blot your forhead throughout the day to take up any oils.     Change your shampoo and conditioners frequently. Buy a volumizing and cleansing shampoo and buy a intense conditioner and light conditioner. Use each one according to how your hair feels that day. If too dry use the intense moisturizor but not on the top of your head. If too oily switch from volumizer to cleansing shampoo and so on.       I have the same problem fine hair but a lot of it.     I hope this works for you like it does for me.|`|qm4Mbhwwaa	use head and shoulders and let your hair dry naturally also dont put to much product in it|`|TrkI5gWbaa	I have the same prob and there's nothing you can really do about it. head and shoulders didnt work for me either... You need to wash your hair everyday if you don't so already, also you can invest in a can of dry shampoo which you spray into your hair to absorb all the oil and then you simply brush out the shampoo. It's really handy and you could use it in the afternoon when your hair gets really oily!|`|vnV5comRaa	Ok so I have had oily/fine hair my entire life and this is what works for me    Shampoo: Massage shampoo at the base of your head, and as you rinse out the shampoo wash the ends with the run off. Remember that old saying "wash, rinse, repeat" WRONG excesive washing at the base can cause overly active oil glands. So thats a big no no.    Conditioner: (Do the opposite of shampoo) only apply the conditioner to the ends of your hair and massage up from there do not apply it to the base.    After hair is dry: Apply 1/2 tsp of baby powder to the base of your scalp by rubbing it in your palms and massaging onto the scalp, this will help absorb any oils that collect during the day.    Once a week: use a clarifying shampoo.    Hope this helps|`|xTaE8GLUaa	Try using translucent powder on your roots to soak up oil|`|GHegLJdOaa	try using anti-frizz...it works wonders, =]    the serum would be ur best choice, just put it in the palm of your hand and then spread it through your hair...from the roots all the way to the ends of your hair.    good luck!|`|Y6eGdkYnaa	try changing your shampoo or conditioner every once in a while? wash your hair everday, and i guess for dryer and crisper hair, blow dry it right after you wash your hair so it wont be as oily i guess|`|hchZhKItaa	cutting it wouldnt make a difference so dont worry about that.

Since you don't have too much experience with the whole makeup thing, I recommend you go to a Department Store counter to get help choosing the right lipstick if it's your first time.

emvIYyufaa	I second the whole "BMI is crap" thing. Don't listen to the BMI. At 5'9" at 149, you would probably look like you're 115-120 just because of your height. Your measurements sound normal. You've got a classic hourglass shape, not too small to be considered a ruler shape but not too big to where it's consdiered freaky and while some people may think a 27 inch waist is big (when comparing it to models with 23-24 inch waists, considering that models like these only account for less than 1% of the population.)

Honestly, I used to be sickened by the girls in high school wearing Elmo, Dora the Explorer, The Wiggles, etc bags because we all know it's not as if they like the show. They just think it's cool/cute to say, "haha! i love Elmo! he's so cute!" and pretend to embarrass themselves in front of boys by saying that they watch the show (which they obviously don't).    If it's nothing like that and you honestly like the bag, go for it.    If I'm describing you, get a real bag.

It REALLY worked for me, I was shocked, it cleared up my skin when nothing else would....and give it at least 2 months. And, I'm married to a cosmetic doctor.     Are you wearing sunblock? That will help improve your blotchiness and will prevent more damage to your skin because the sun makes any imperfections worse. Find an oil free one, 30 SPF and wear it daily on your face neck hands. You will thank me! Don't just use the type where the SPF is in your makeup, not enough is applied and doesn't protect. You need a broad spectrum one.     For the oily skin part, that's tough because the Clarisonic brush deep cleanses but it can also make your skin more oily from your skin being too clean...I like masks that are made for soaking up oil, Neutrogena makes some great ones, one is the Acne something mask, and it's cheap. Would use maybe every other day.    Also the Neutrogena Rapid Acne products (white with orange labels), their salicylic acne pads work great on my decollete where I would get breakouts sometime, use them wherever you have acne and it will soak up oil and cure the zits. Good luck!    Also you can get monthly glycolic acid peels but they are about $90 each and you have to find a really really really good person to do them, not just someone working in a salon. Hope this all helps!|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	mask: Aztec Indian Healing Clay Mask  cleanser: Cetaphil  bi-weekly scrub: DO NOT USE APRICOT SCRUBS! anything with jojoba beads and no ammonium laureth sulfate in it  oily skin still needs moisturizer, if you dry it out more the skin tries to overcompensate: any high end brand, i splurge on the moisturizer its the last step in your skincare regime and it stays with you. i think a moisturizer is the most important piece for anyone, cleansers are cheap. get something fancy for yourself, get samples at nordstroms at the different counters and see which ones you like. you just have to try things there are so many. if you dont wanna splurge the cetaphil moisturizer will work too, its recd by dermatologists because it doesnt have preservatives or dyes and perfumes|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Lemon juice.

It is a natural and harmless scalp condition in which the shedding of dead skin cells occurs at an unusually fast rate. Because of the oily skin often associated with this condition, these cells clump together and flake off as dandruff.    Description    Dandruff is very common. Up to one-third of the U.S. population is affected by this condition. While it is not considered a disease, dandruff is a cosmetic concern for many people.    The following problems tend to exacerbate dandruff:        * cold weather      * dry indoor heating      * stress (physical or emotional)      * food allergies      * nutritional deficiencies (B-complex vitamins or omega-3 fatty acids)      * use of hair spray and gels      * use of hair-coloring chemicals      * use of electric hair curlers or blow dryers    Causes & Symptoms    Dandruff is caused by an overgrowth of skin cells that make up the scalp. It is not known what accelerates this cell growth. However, scientists have suggested that dandruff may be a hypersensitive reaction to the proliferation of Pityrosporum ovale, a yeast that occurs naturally on the scalp. Another theory that held for some time linked dandruff to a fungus. A 2002 report said that scientists had identified new fungi of the Malassezia that seem to exist in overabundance on the scalps of those affected with the disease.    Diagnosis    Dandruff is easy to diagnose. The condition is characterized by the appearance of white flakes on the hair or on the shoulders and collar. People with oily hair tend to have dandruff more often. Dandruff usually does not require medical treatment. However, if, in addition to dandruff, a person also has greasy scaling on the face, eyebrows and eyelashes and thick, red patches on the body, he or she may have the more severe form of seborrheic dermatitis. This condition may require medical advice and treatment.    Treatment    Alternative treatments for dandruff include nutritional therapy, herbal therapy and relaxation therapy.    Nutritional Therapy    The following nutritional changes may be helpful:        * Identification and avoidance of potential allergenic foods.      * Limited intake of milk and other dairy products, seafoods and fatty treats. These foods tend to exacerbate dandruff.      * Reduction or elimination of animal proteins and eating mostly whole grains, fresh vegetables, beans and fruit.      * Avoiding citrus until dandruff clears.      * Diet supplemented with B-complex vitamins which may alleviate dandruff condition.      * Avoiding excess salt, sugar, and alcohol.      * Taking 1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil per day. Flaxseed oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may be effective in treating a variety of skin conditions including dandruff.    From a traditional medical approach, dandruff may be the body's way of eliminating excess protein accumulated but not assimilated in the system. It may also be a symptom of liver and kidney imbalances. A more stabilizing diet is needed, reducing highly acidic foods such as tomatoes and certain spices.    Herbal Therapy    Massaging tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) into the scalp may help prevent or relieve dandruff. This oil can relieve scaling and itching. Ayurvedic treatment also includes various oil therapies, called suehana for the head. Increased exercise can increase circulation and help eliminate fats and oils.    Relaxation Therapies    Relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga may help relieve stress, which exacerbates dandruff.    Allopathic Treatment    There is no cure for this natural harmless skin condition. Because a greasy scalp is associated with dandruff condition, more frequent hair washing using regular shampoo is usually all that is needed. In more severe cases, medicated shampoo may be necessary.    The two most commonly used anti-dandruff shampoos are selenium sulfide and zinc pyrithione. Both of these are cytostatic agents. Cytostatic drugs slow down the growth and formation of top skin layer on the scalp. To get the best result, one should leave the shampoo on for as long as possible. It is recommended that a person lather the anti-dandruff shampoo at the beginning of the shower, leave it on until the end of the shower, then rinse, lather, and rinse again. As a result of treatment with any of these drugs, dandruff will become less noticeable. Because it can be irritating, shampoo containing selenium sulfide should not be used if the skin is cut or abraded.    Products containing salicylic acid and sulfur are reserved for more severe cases. Salicylic acid loosens the dead skin cells so that they can be sloughed off more easily.

With P&G getting aggressive in the Indian FMCG market which is estimated to be around Rs 50000 crore with aggressive product launches and price wars, we are now seeing marketing in practice.    Globally P&G has been the market leader in the haircare segment. In India it was not able to replicate its marketing success. Having a share of only 15-20 %, P&G is now concentrating on building the market share and HLL is feeling the heat.    Hll has been working on the best selling Clinic Plus brand with lot of noise in the media. From Shah Rukh to Shahid, the brand was promoted by film stars. Hll also gave a regional touch by roping in Madhavan for the south as its brand ambassador.

Now get the BEST idea:    It is not possible to stop dandruff / hairloss with simple home-remedies or with ordinary routine shampoos like Head & Shoulders, Clinic all clear, etc. As somebody has put in their reply above, these brands are all marketing exercises only and do no good to the user. Infact, there is hardly any science behind these products. You may get temporary relief for some-time but a permanent result (cure) is simply not possible. Home-based traditional remedies work only for maintenance purpose i.e for keeping good hair good. Dandruff and hairloss need a serious treatment and you should prefer natural remedies. Treatments with chemicals and drugs will have side-effects and reversal effects - problems recur once you discontinue. Specifically for dandruff and hairloss, you should look for the following natural ingredients/organic stuff and hair-vitamins that will give you lasting relief i.e a complete cure else severe hairloss will set in-    Kelp,   Nettle,  Provitamin B5,  Rosemary extract,  Roobois extract,  Gingko Biloba,  Chamomile extract,  Horsetail extract,  Comfrey extract,  Wheat protein,  Aloe Vera,  Cystine,  Soya extract,  Inositol,  Biotin,  Niacin,  Grapefruit seed extract,  etc etc.     One or two of these ingredients won't help. Only in a combination they will give your hair and scalp holistic health.    All these and much more is found in Segals Solutions Program, now available in India. They guarantee results.     Segals Solutions is a breakthrough researched formula and is the newest recommendation for solving dandruff and potential hairloss issues, all without side-effects, by doctors also.    Results are incredibly fast. For me it came in just 5-6 weeks and hasn't occurred thereafter. They gave me some advanced hair supplement and a special formula and also a special shampoo that they told works from within the hair-root. Results are incredible! I must say, it was a comprehensive solution that I found after almost 2-3 years of severe dandruff, dry scalp and hairloss and when all trials with what not, didn't just seem to work. Their secret of success is in their ingredients. Just study it yourself - the uniqueness of it. I am sure you would have no option but to be convinced with the strengths of Segals Solutions. I don't think we have any other comparable thing in the market or even any other option.....    P.S: Ketoconazole based shampoos like Nizoral and Selsun won't give you lasting and desired results...... They are not even near the efficacy of Segals Solutions products|`|CUdQ2ymEaa	use coconut oil with lemon...before bath...surely help you...i have studied this in an Aurvadic book...|`|TEW2oCF2aa	I had dandruff for so many years and lost half of my hair.

Two tablespoons of these seeds should be soaked overnight in water and ground into a fine paste in the morning. This paste should be applied all over the scalp and left for half an hour. The hair should then be washed thoroughly with soap-nut (ritha) solution or acacia concinna.    Dandruff treatment using Lime  The use of a teaspoon of fresh lime juice for the last rinse, while washing the hair, is another useful remedy. This not only leaves the hair glowing but also removes stickiness and prevents dandruff.    Dandruff treatment using Green Gram Powder  A valuable prescription for removal of dandruff is the use of green gram powder. The hair should be washed twice a week with two tablespoons of this powder mixed with half a cup of curd.    Dandruff treatment using Beet  Beets have been found useful in dandruff. Both tops and roots should be boiled in water and this water should be massaged into the scalp with the finger tips every night. White beet is better for this purpose.

But regular use of shampoo, without taking the guidance of a hair/skin specialist can harm the original beauty of your hair. Therefore, if you are caught by dandruff, first go to a skin specialist to identify the root of the problem.    Proper diet takes a great role to remove dandruff. Taking more animal fat and unsaturated vegetable oils can harm your scalp. For that you may need to sacrifice some of your favorite dishes. Get a diet chart from a skin specialist and make sure you are not consuming chocolate, iodized salt, and nuts and foods, which are high in calories.    Balanced intake of Vitamin A, E and B Complex is important for long and healthy hair. Include green vegetables, chicken, fish and milk in your diet chart, and you will get these vitamins in proper quantity. Drink sufficient water, since it takes good care of your skin.    Dandruff is the dead cell of our scalp and this happens due to the disturbance of blood circulation in the scalp. Go for Yoga therapy or massage, for it will help circulating blood in the scalp. It is also important to brush your hair gently - on a regular basis.    Researches have found that use of herbal shampoo on every other day is very effective to reduce oily dandruff. Like oily dandruff, dry dandruff also needs extensive care. To remove them massage your hair with the oil prescribed by the skin specialist. Move your fingertips gently on the scalp and leave for few minutes before washing your hair.    Try cosmetic therapy at your home to remove dandruff    In this fast moving world it may not be possible get hair therapy in every week. Time is a big factor for busy people who are suffering form dandruff. Some cosmetic treatments, which can be done at home, can work like magic for them. Even others can also try these to make their hair attractive and dandruff free.    If you are suffering from oily flakes, rinse your hair with vinegar. For this, you have to follow some easy steps:  ? Fill a mug with fresh water  ? Mix two tablespoons of malt Vinegar in it  ? Use shampoo in your hair that is prescribed by a skin specialist  ? Rinse your hair with Vinegar mixed water  ? Dry your hair with a clean towel    On the other hand, if you are suffering from dry and white flakes, use oil massage. Following are the steps to take oil massage:  ? Make a mixture of hot Castor oil (1 teaspoon), Coconut oil (1 teaspoon) and Mole oil (1 teaspoon)  ? Massage gently with the mixture on your scalp  ? Keep the hair for about 30 minutes  ? Wash your hair with a prescribed shampoo  ?

zrGNhkcRaa	Exfoliate like there's no tomorrow.    Use a scrub or a shower poof or even just a rough wash cloth and scrub the hell out of the area where you're waxing. Ideally you should do this before you wax and maintain that afterwards. That won't keep you from getting any ingrown hairs ever, but it will greatly, greatly reduce the occurrence of them.|`|xhjSPd0uaa	gently pick the hair out from under the skin, but only if it comes out easily, dont pick at it, it'll come to the top of the skin eventually.  then dot sudocream or savlon (but sudocrem is best, its baby nappy rash cream lol) on each spot    it kills infection an takes away the redness FAST|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Just pull them out!
aZHCuoxJaa	I bought some last week and have only tried them once so far.  I used the "long & narrow" curlformers on my shoulder length blonde hair.  They were a little tricky to put in at first, but I think it will be easier the next time around.  I did have trouble getting them out and ended up pulling out a lot of hair with the rollers.  But I loved the curls and am going to try again this weekend.  My hair is very hard to curl and the curlformers gave me a curl that looked like I have naturally curly hair and the curls lasted for 2 days.  As for the expense, you will need a lot of rollers - at least 4 packs - because you can only put a small amount of hair in each roller.

ZiQPPbquaa	I would say Solange, Kelis, Avril Lavigne(she toned down a little) and Katy Perry|`|nyeUUojFaa	ew look at those earrings in the pic where shes wearing the leopard-print top.
cZCaHWhOaa	For smokey eyes you should generally use a dark grey to brown color. You should blend different shades of the same type of color to give it definition. Then you should use a color along those lines but just a little darker to outline the eyes and use a smudger so that the lines to not look so "drawn" on. You want to use that onthe top and bottom of the eye. I would not go sith a liquid liner, I use one of those self sharpening eye pencils. It helps to use some of your eye shadow to also outline he eye to give it that extra smokey look.    Also, the link you have posted to your picture is set to private so noting is showing up.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	if your profile is on private, it does no good to post a link!|`|G1OJNCF4aa	Okay, so try liquid top eyeliner or pencil, a super thin line!  Then put a thin line of black eyeshadow outlining your eye, with a brown or smokey colored eyeshadow that blends, then try a nice bronzer I think it would look great, and bring out your features|`|rQTu4w9qaa	like a clown|`|tGVp5fyJaa	pic isn't showing up - can you please put up again
M4E9XIFgaa	Yes its really cute!  It all matches nicely and is very simple yet dressy.|`|YT4bBWwVaa	it's okay, but it's boring, spice it up abit by wearing shorts or a skirt,|`|PuqlSfKcaa	That is too cute. I'm really liking those jeans! Nice color combo.|`|3OI0jLfSaa	dont change the colour of the top its nice as it is and i woul wear boots instead too because there wharm too other than that its a nice outfit|`|tg6bqGgcaa	Very nice cute and simple =]  I'm 19 and in college as well.  But to make that outfit REALLY pop,  tell your step sis to replace the flats  with black boots. Either heeled or not.  And it be more kudos if those boots were  of a suade (sp?) material! =]|`|XuiHsjQOaa	i think it kind of cute..i definitely wouldnt wear socks with the flats =/  it wouldnt look nice at all..and since the cardigan is preety long try a shorter top or tank :)|`|NhV6lDsBaa	well...its ok but boring...its all black...and btw socks with flats is a no no! either you wear a see-through socks or nothing, or wear sneakers with socks if you want..  but why dont she wear something brighter, like a nice jacket or sumthing like that|`|70QRG1afaa	Ya, it's cute. But it doesn't say much about who she is. It's exactly what everyone else is wearing. Maybe that's what she wants, but I think she should explore herself a bit more. Clothes are a safe way to do that.|`|a1p3IyNmaa	Nice t-shirt, and jeans. The cardigan might be a bit old-fashioned; besides, you'd be in a thick winter coat anyways. You can try a leather or denim jacket, those are pretty cool, especially inside. As to the shoes, all i gotta say is...do you wanna wreck them with the dirty slush? Just wear sneakers or something.|`|Qzyoh9Vpaa	thats real cute and casual.  How about brighter shoes if she can.  Or Blue .... Gray?  i dunno but that would be cool.  try store 21. i got some nice gray foldover boots there   xx|`|5S1CK8olaa	yesshe will with F*  $ me boots|`|IymYDye3aa	That's definitely something I would wear.  But flats with socks, is a huge No-No.  In my opinion, they look quite unfashionable.    But, if you insist on wearing socks, with flats, do this.    http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs...    that skirt with these leggings    http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs...    except in a vibrant color like, purple, or pink.    that would be way cute.    or, instead of the flats wear boots.|`|nKwcGLQraa	i like it, although it would look even cuter if she had a skirt instead of jeans. bu ti guess if its cold outside its nto a very good idea. :p.    also, something really bright would make it so much cuter. its very dark right now (well, depends on how purpley blue it is)|`|sz2SatQ9aa	its kinda ok! but never ever wear socks with black flats is you can see the foot! wear some stockings for your feet so u can't see them!|`|AFkmdu92aa	yes! very cute and stylish but the whole sock thing maybe she should tough it out and wear no socks it would make the outfit soo much cuter.  lol beauty is pain;)    i hope it helps:)|`|GTwVNeHraa	I like the first sweater, not the second one, I LOVE the black skinny jeans, but the flats could be better.|`|0SQou2X9aa	oh thats a great outfit.i love everything!i would wear it but with a brighter top,or a colourful scarf or belt,n a big handbag.i think the socks are ok if its cold,but the jeans should cover em.what a stylish ma u are!wish u were mine!|`|oeF9FvqRaa	i just love the jeans.|`|i983Dk2Maa	yes very cute|`|MRwb4jQYaa	The outfit itself is cute, but DO NOT wear flats with socks.  Wear some cute boots or something, or bear the cold and wear no socks, but socks would ruin this outfit.|`|9EdJHqKHaa	looks cute|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	yes its very cute and stylish I would totally wear that =)|`|tqmXnkvnaa	oh, very nice :).    I like it except for the socks and flats idea. the long necklaces would help the outfit stand out.|`|W89Q30J7aa	Yes it all goes and its a cute outfit, i think you could get better flats cheaper, try new look, jane norman, next have some really nice styles... add a few bangles, there super cheap in primark and a neck scarf would add more flavour, again primark have some great cheap ones, and a nice big bag, River island has a really nice shopper bag that would look great for college its 12,|`|7XIyslo5aa	Yeah it's really nice and simple. :)|`|ZVHtkTS9aa	yeah thats a lovely outfit, i'd wear it.|`|QgiTgc6paa	Looks nice, but I would go with a shorter top to go under the cardi, since it's long already, but otherwise it's great, looks like something I would wear.|`|CBKpuMjDaa	the cardigan is a bit grandma-ish for a college student.  flats are in so i suppose thats cool :)  The shirt is simple but cute.
u25R7XIGaa	I think it'll be good if you do it over the course of about two months. If you show up one day in rocker clothes you'll just look WEIRD to people. If you're going to change your hair, do that first, in my opinion. You could start out by wearing clothes you wear now, just more of the ones that are closer to the look you want...  don't shock their systems.|`|4WjZTF1saa	i have changed styles a lot over the last few years but i wouldn't do it all at once... slowly start collecting clothes and accessories and begin to change.. that way it will be less shocking to everyone|`|JxSM7ByUaa	im 14 and i know that if my friend totally changed her style id be surprised but id compliment her.   for the hardcore or rocker look, try baggy cargo pants, or black mini skirts. converse shoes also look good :)|`|UowKnHKdaa	As long as you don't drastically change your appearance, I don't think your friends will be too surprised. Maybe you could change your style little by little until people are used to your new look.|`|WyRZhqi4aa	Go ahead and change your style.   All you are doing are changing your outward appearance, nobody can truly change their inner self. People will call you a "poser", since apparently you can't dress a specific way that you like since it resembles the vast majority of a certain "crowd" such as the hardcore or rocker crowd and that is just absurd.  So go ahead, experiment with new looks until you find one that suits you. It doesn't have to reflect your inner self.|`|8irbUx4eaa	trust me babe, being yourself is much cooler than being like everyone else!|`|Ws663hBVaa	Honey, its perfectly normal. Im fifteen this year and yeah i do care about what other people think even though i know i shouldnt. But still. You should do it. If someone changed their style I think most of the feedback would be completely positive. And no one is seriously going to be too affected by it except for you. Erms. Well, right now I's recommend some ripped jeans, Balmain or Alexander Wang style, PVC tights, leather jackets, motorcycle boots, over-sized shirts and singlets, and lots of studsss! Haahaah. Good luck love. ;)
cYCqgiARaa	I bought the NYC blush  And its pretty.  I think there are like a couple different colors.  But its shiny  Like they have nice colors,  but they are pretty shiny.    So if your looking for color with no shine, don"t get it  But if you are, they are pretty good :)    The concealer is pretty good too  It would probably cover up heavy dark circles  but it works sooo much better if you use a concealer brush to apply.    Hope I helped :)|`|ZMVs9bGxaa	Well your not gonna use the blush on your eyes so i'd go for it  and with my eyes i have the same problem, i use a yellow concealer stick called physicians formula gentle cover concealer and i put covergirl clean ivory concealer over top of that and then i blend some powder so my face doesn't look oily|`|cjlWiqqCaa	Try one of these brands     Wet and Wild   Rimmel|`|oIUNvpYFaa	Physician's Formula has some pretty great cream concealers. I like the ones that are green and yellow because I can better manipulate them to my skin. PF covers well though!|`|6YWlqDkYaa	well.nyc is cheap and cover-girl is hypoallergenic although, you do need alot, i don't know if you heard of mary-kay but, that is the best concealer you could buy, it shaves years off and covers up, dark circles. its way better than mac. but make-up wise i use mayb. ny., wiped. cover girl is only good for the powders.i love the dramatic look.|`|aeVBMtEfaa	I heard Jane blushes are pretty good,   and for the concealer I would recommend Max Factor Pan-Stick  and before you apply your concealer warm it up on the back of your hand so it doesn't look cakey.
7VwdSHd8aa	britany spears curious comes in a bottle that has a seperate spritzer that attaches so u can just use it from bottle if u prefer, also y not just get the purfume u want and empty it into another purfume bottle, "diamonds and pearls" shops have some beautiful bottles although prob sum lovely one on internet x|`|h73d3wJ2aa	You will find that alot of the very very expensive perfumes come in open top bottles. I am sure Penhalagons dont have sprays or maybe even Floris of London.|`|ToWc1yYYaa	Perfumes from the last few years typically come in a spray bottle so I can understand why you would have trouble. It is mostly pure perfumes that would be in an open top bottle. Try Chanel?     If not you could alwasy buy a perfume bottle on its own and fill it with a nice fragrance?    You can get beautiful bottles from most jewellry and gift shops that aren't too expensive. If you want a fragrance to put in it make sure it is one with an easy to remove lid.     Hope this helps|`|zpovg4U7aa	you usually have to open the bottle and pour it into the spray bottle.|`|xTaE8GLUaa	perfume oil, like at Body Shop.
Fd4EBV1Vaa	L'Oral Elnett Satin Supreme Hold hairpary. Elnett comes in different strengths but the supreme hold is the strongest.It has a really long lasting hold without the feeling of stiffness. It also protects your style against the effects of humidity so your style can stay perfect for longer.   It sprays ultra-fine so you can hardly see it or feel it and disappears at the stroke of a brush.|`|NEglsYQAaa	aqua net  hairspray|`|eFLiKTB3aa	my suggestion is that when you have finished curling your hair, flip it upside down and spray with hairspray( i use Sunsilk flexible hold), then flip your hair back and spray it above your hair in a circle around your head. it should stay curly for longer.|`|CHovtvUdaa	Lol, i like to curl my hair with a straightener.You can use almost any brand, just as long as it says "super styling hold" or something along those lines, i use shwarzkopf, it really works well, you can also try garnier fructis. Good luck --|`|6GFw9gkraa	Tresemme darling, its fabulous!|`|VBXt2jRSaa	I have this problem - i have very shiney long straight hair and after years of trying to curl it i brought some babyliss heated rollers and some tresemme hair spray - i know this isn't that good for your hair (my hair dresser told me) but once in a while is ok and they lasted a good few hours!!|`|K2dxDdyqaa	Mouse is always good for curling you hair!|`|W89Q30J7aa	Whilst your hair is still wrapped around the Straighteners, spray it with hair spray, so the heat sets the spray in your hair, do this until you've finished and quick spritz all over when you've finished just make sure the cans arms length away, that way u get the effect of the spray without ur hair all matting together!|`|CaCTQ3Qbaa	Are you using a thermal protector? Try using paul mitchell seal and shine spray, that is a heat activated thermal protector. While you style your hair and then use tigi curls rock hair spray for curls. This should help keep the style you what.|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	When I do this I use L'oreal Curling Spray and then a little basic hairspray afterwards, it helps alot! :]
vXf2rrYraa	vinegar, I've used it before. i used to have blue hair.|`|rd6eRnzTaa	I dyed my hair completely black, and I tried many different things, and the only way I got it lighter enough to dye brown was to bleach it, just leave it in long enough that you think you could dye it again.|`|zoulSmjUaa	swimming in the beach or pool fades dye  head and shoulders or washing hair regularly  the sun    Ohh and so people say if you leave head and shoulders in for 30mins it brings dye out of your hair. It works but it really stuffs up your hair so if you do this make sure you use a leave in mositurer in your hair    hope i helped

edAtsw3waa	I cleanse and exfoliate my face first and dry off. Then I use these little circular pads meant for blackheads (clearasil sells them) with little scrubing beads on my nose. It helps to loosen everything up, ready for the pore pack. It's the only way they work for me! Oh and make sure you remove the excess off with hot water and keep it wet ready for the pore pack.|`|nZjyIAVhaa	Do you mean the Biore pack?    It should say on the packet. You cleanse your face and make sure it's wet afterwards.   Then peel off the sticker and put it on your nose on the sticky side.   Then peel it off after 10 minutes when it has gone hard.   xx

0g08GDKcaa	Sweetie you have to stop this kind of thinking right now or it will easily become a disorder. Your height is fine for your weight.

You don't even need to lose weight.|`|ygiybahvaa	i like feeling hungry too! i dont kno y tho! i thought it was just me! well, try NOT to eat big meals. i have a hard time digesting foods and stuff, so im sapposed to eat 9 meals everyday (1/3 of a normal meal) and i get full really fast too!   you might want to just call like a nurse hotline thing and ask...|`|tq1eQwRZaa	I have orthorexia nervosa, an eating disorder where i only eat safe foods that are low in fat, sugar and are healthy, like fruits and beans and low-carb stuff. I would say i eat about 1200 calories per day and when i get hungry between meals, i actually feel really great and skinny and healthy (btw i'm 16, 5'1 and 85 lbs). When i eat something that's kinda unhealthy, like chocolate or something that has over 1 gram of saturated fat, i feel so fat and bad about myself. But im the same way, i only eat small meals every few hours and i like being hungry. it makes me feel in control. so i would say you have an eating disorder. there are a lot of people out there you can talk to and discuss your problems w/o feeling selfconcious.|`|zpovg4U7aa	if you like the feeling of emptiness because you feel that you are thinner that way and more beautiful, then i would say if not an eating disorder, at least disordered eating (or ednos, AKA eating disorder not otherwise specified).    if you don't like the pain when you eat, and would prefer being hungry because its not as uncomfortable as the pain, i would say see a doctor for your stomach pains.|`|PGfQNIOLaa	Girl go see a dietician they know how to fix your problem!!!  freakishly skinny is sooo not in!!!!|`|kauRr6X8aa	You need to speak to your parents and a doctor about this.|`|YT4bBWwVaa	see a doctor, you don't necessarily have to speak to your mom, just say like your foot hurts and ask her to book you a appointment, and  just don't go into the room with her, and if you ask the the doctor i'm sure they won't say anything, if you were 16 you wouldn't have to lie or even talk to your mom about it,

I get a lot of compliments on my eyes...|`|5vcd7GHNaa	Reddish Brown, Ginger, Blonde, the fire colours. :]|`|TGHQW9FTaa	dishwater blond a.k.a dirty blonde or brunette anything but red head|`|MzgecQSLaa	a sandy or dirty blonde might look nice
xtrdlyJHaa	Sally Beauty has a generic (GVP...Generic Value Products) made by the company that makes CHI. I got one and I LOVE IT!  It heats up so quickly and it has taken a beating. It makes my hair straight...even heating...no damage...nice controls.     It came with an incredible package of a mini hot curler set, a brush and some other cool girl things in a cute case!    That is just if you want to save some money...I am poor.    Check out overstock.com or eBay if you want to get one of the pricey ones.    There is a new one on the infomercials that looks great for hair like yours...have you seen it? It has a rod and a straightener. http://www.getinstyler.com/?TrackId=4115...|`|jdHLDwxUaa	these are some really great ones!!    KIYOSEKI- about 110$    CURLMASTER CERAMICS- 80-100$    the CHI- 100-150$|`|iiRU9kEoaa	GHD, you can google up 'GHD reviews' and there are ratings and comments of people who has used the GHD. I just bought one, I love it. You can style your hair straight, curly, wavy, volume, just the way you like.    it's $299 (Australian money), a bit pricey i know. But it would worth every dollar.   you can get it cheaper on.    http://ry.com.au/store/    cheers x|`|K85qdy38aa	GHD straightener is the best!  here in Australia i paid around $280 for mine|`|9t5zCRoBaa	The Instyler!!! it really works im a whitness lol i have the thick'es curliest most frizziest hair u could ever see and it worked on me it really works|`|5ith7Qyoaa	I work at Ulta, which is a really big beauty store. The CHI is a great flat iron. There are quite a few different ones, and a whole line of hair products that are formulated to increase the powers of the flat irons. If you dont wanna drop the cash for a CHI (they can get pretty pricey), Id suggest finding a Sallys Beauty Supply and buying a GVP. Its basically the same thing as the origninal CHI irom but easilt for half the price, and it comes it comes in all kinds of crazy colors and shapes. The GVP is what i have at home, but trust me as soon as i start getting my employee discount im gonna have a CHI!|`|lLHUSMiRaa	the GHD,  its best one out and all the hairdressers use it.  cost around $300, it heats up in about 9 seconds and is soooo good !!  i couldnt live without myne.|`|vXf2rrYraa	I have the same type hair so you should use Bed Head, And There products are the best. Im not so sure about the prices at the moment.|`|DtVMrNvNaa	the best flat iron in my opinion is the CHI. it's awesome!! it'll transform hair like yours and it'll leave it looking silky! i love it and i'll never buy anything else! it runs about $150-$200 .... i think..|`|QY48ErA3aa	search with google, there r lot of websites like    www.Folica.com    www.hairstraightening.net|`|zoulSmjUaa	Ive heard ghd is really good. I think there about $299   Try ghd for thicker hair.|`|e3b3013e9da6d11fe599161a1e37c315aa	I knew before I clicked people would be saying GHD, but it is not the best in my opinion, I have one!  My hair is not too thin or thick and long and straight and when I straighten my hair, its straight for about a few hours afterwards before it starts to curl slightly.     My hairdresser also says the GHD is not the best, the reason I got one in the first place was because everyone raved how good they were but I was disappointed when I got it, its all hype.
d6d6ba532d5982bcf991fac313dd88a1aa	Depends what the job is.    If it's going to be in a professional business-type environment, then you should absolutely cut your hair.    If it's in a more artistic field where you'd have more leeway with your appearance, maybe a trim is all you need.    Whatever you decide to do, dress appropriate to the position you're trying to get.  I.E. conservative suit and tie for an office, nice jeans and a jacket if you're going to be a radio DJ.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	no~ you are so cute!|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	Yes.|`|vMG0CHmgaa	yeah, i could never get my job with long hair then i cut it back and i was hired on the spot lol|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	oh jesus..yeah slick it back but dont make it look greasy or cut it a week before interview if you cant so u get comfortable in the cut and can play around with styles    good luck on that interview champ!|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	for business professional jobs yes cut it    for live band, music, art, ski resort, that sort of stuff no leave it.|`|uReFjOONaa	yes|`|NlulTfFOaa	It would be nice, but if you can manage to find a way to control your frizz that could be nice, too :)|`|ZS5FI34waa	You gata be crazy if your going to cut it. Looks way better long
Yf8yZVM9aa	go short; because short is(almost) always better. Ive seen; like; two guys who have pulled off the long hair. short is best; not just for the interview.|`|djtrHXsbaa	both pics are the same
qoS3gUukaa	I think the first pair look a little more classy and elegant. I would pick the first pair. Have fun at the wedding! Xx|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I think the second pair are def much nicer :)|`|Xhivbo6zaa	I love the second pairs x|`|Zx0fWY68aa	I like the first one better. It's more classic|`|PNIihEDXaa	1st seem more suitable for a wedding but theyre both lovely!  sorry to confuse you but hteyre both so hot :) the first is good for a wedding but the second could be worn more often because its less formal you know.. good luck anyway!|`|4TssH9WQaa	I like the first ones as they look more classy and look better all-round than the second.|`|2XTkSV4daa	The second one is way better, it looks cuter and since the heel is shorter you will feel better.|`|taQFWXuHaa	Love the first ones. but the second ones look way more comfortable. they are both great!!!!|`|BWUlksmmaa	Definitely the first pair...I LOVE them.  Not keen at all on the second pair sorry.|`|Fd4EBV1Vaa	Definitely the first ones! They are way more classy.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	To be honest, both look good, but it really depends on what you are wearing, and when the wedding is for. The first pair look delicate, so they would be ideal for a summer wedding, with a dress. The 2nd pair are a bit heavier, maybe ideal with the wedding is maybe April, May, but again depends on what you are wearing. If you have them both, then try them on with your outfit, if you dont, take a look at your outfit and think about the look you are going for. The first is definately a more delicate shoe. Both are great shoes!|`|h73d3wJ2aa	First pair def. But second pair lovely too.  Weddings are a long day...really should try both and send one back. Take whatever fits best on your feet.
bgKYeLG4aa	I had lots of these too unfortunetly,  Just wait, what ever you do dont squeze it, it will inflame it and damage the skin.  Just wait a couple of days,  it will either come up on its own or go down.  if it comes up dont pop it straight away as the white stuff is white blood cells so popping it actually makes it worse for your body as you are helping the bacteria.  So yea just wait, it seems bad now but its only a week in your life and when you leave school you realise that school doesnt matter it is petty and fake.|`|qnfkRZzKaa	1. Do not touch!!!! yes, it will get bigger if u touch it. i know from my own experience lol  2. cleanse daily and dont eat greasy food that will stick to ur face  3. dont pop it or the bacteria will spread and ur whole face will be pimply o.o|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	It most likely won't break skin. When i have that, i use neutrogena's vanishing cream. I glob it on at night and when i wake up, the pimple is all dried up (usually) for really bad ones you might have to do it a couple times.  Don't do that if you are sensitive to benzoyl peroxide
kCGIAEsBaa	What kind of party is it?     You could just wear a cute dress, but not too long or you'll look dead formal!       Or just wear some wet look leggings with a long top :)        .... Unless you're a guy, didn't think fo that!      Then just wear some nice jeans with a shirt :)|`|NMwNKcXQaa	um well define if your a male or female!  if your a girl; tights a cute floral dress w/ a large cardigan and a double latched belt!  but if your a boy skinny jeans that don't cut off all circulation and a tight fitting T but make your its a comfortable fit|`|NCGcY5VSaa	A smile.
iJZ5Efb0aa	dude wtf.  i see your pictures like EVERYWHERE and everytime they're posted on a question, its either under a different name or what not.  gett some frickin self esteem.|`|d1d43c8be7b4dd12bd1e7e90583bbe5eaa	Elsa ... it's a New Year ... at least post some new pics ... pleeeeeeease|`|JxSM7ByUaa	get a fringe, either a side fringe or a front one. you could also try using makeup since your features are pretty plain lol. like mascara, eyeliner lipgloss  try dying your hair red or another colour :)|`|zpovg4U7aa	i'd say grow out your hair and get a stylish little cut. you have nice features on your face and you would look very stylish with a nice, long haircut (with bangs i would say?).|`|YZFk1Eu4aa	You keep posting this question girly. But I think some hair highlights, and some make-up, mascara, black eye liner, light pink lippy with a clear gloss over the top plus some bright pink blush over your cheek bones. You really need some self confidence though!!|`|AA10236778	Perfection at its best. No you dont need anything.|`|AYQcuXVkaa	i think high lights would make u pop out more :) it would look so nice oh and btw your very pretty|`|p8lNnrzqaa	you already have a pretty face and skin so you wont need to do much,  as for the eyes to make them pop put some eyeliner, mascara or eyeshadow on. for the hair you just need to get a little haircut and style it a little and it will give a boost to your confidence,here are some ideas:  http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...    http://www.totalhair.net/hair-styles/gal...|`|5GWzRFc4aa	Aw, hun, you don't kneed a makeover, I think you're pretty :]     But if you really want to change your appearance, I would say use some eyeliner on your bottom waterline and your top water and lashline. Curl your lashes and then use Great Lash Mascara by Maybelline New York [its a miracle worker, I used to use it a lot and it made my lashes grow thicker and longer ^__^] . Then just some mineral/powder to even out your skin tone and a teeny tiny bit o' blush under your cheekbones to highlight your complexion more.     I dunno what your current hair color is but I liked the picture with your natural brown hair better. Maybe just touch up the hair with more defined layers or grow it out, but other then that, I think you already look perfect :D|`|XuiHsjQOaa	your cute already!  :)  but if you wannaa make a change i would say grow your hair out..and maybe do jet black. i think it would be nice color  ..and i guess makeup   i would also say Self Confidence!!..it always makes you feel better|`|1hJJoOUEaa	You're cute.|`|ayr62d25aa	Some honey colored highlights would be cute. Also, you have gorgeous eyes, if you used some dark eyeliner and mascara they would pop even more.|`|eM3tXyqBaa	you have a pretty face just change your hairstyle
AA10849332	common?     yes      sign of a possible serious problem?    yes.      it would be a good idea to talk to your doctor about this.|`|uQ9SXDmaaa	yeah its normal. it happens to me when i work out. ask a doctor, and be careful. btw, your really hot.
nesqHNZ0aa	I know, there lifestyle rocks! I guess there just lucky to be in sunny California where there are sooo many opportunities, and fun stuff to do, depends on where you live, kind of. It doesnt stop you doing cool stuff tho. Wear bright, quirky and unique clothes.. always take care of your appearance.. And I think confidence most of them have :)).. I sooo wanna move there and start over...lol it would be amazing. And yes they are mega rich which helps them to look good. i.e. flawless skin, bright white teeth, highlights.. amazin clothes.. so it does help alot if your rich! xx.*. :)|`|9s0Pfvvmaa	they have all designer    living in sunny california its always bright,  i know what you mean, i wanted there lifestyle too,  now i do :)  i buy replicas of designer clothes, go parties & just look my best,  get yourself out there  but dont follow everything, we wouldnt want you pregnant at 16 & be a heroin addict now would we ?|`|8cWP9SMIaa	first of all,you dont need to change completely who you are.90210 may influence you but it must be for your own benefit.For you to be confident.All i know is they are fond of wearing bright colors.Be experimental
rd6eRnzTaa	yes, my friend used those. And instead of using a wax she dipped all the sides of synthetic hair dread quickly in boiling water and it locked them, try that|`|MYgNCPzcaa	Yes it will work. I personally do not do dreads but I have seen alot of videos showing how to do it on youtube. I suggest going to youtube and watching those.|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	It might it it is human hair! but it will probably look odd.

OodkdbdDaa	i think a better thing would be to not get on a scale in those two months. or limit your scale use. looking in the mirror is something a lot of times happens accidentally.     I think you can achieve close to that. I lost 30 pounds in a month and a half. I just worked out almost every night and cut my calorie intake. here are two sites i think will help you. the first is a site that will help you calculate how many calories your body needs daily, so you will know how many you should take in. and the second is one that will calculate how many calories you burn depending on what you do.     http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/calneed    http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calories...    good luck. don't let anyone tell you that you cant do this.|`|4u9qI9Iyaa	yah sure|`|kauRr6X8aa	NO.    You want to look and see how well you're doing. It'll be good motivation.    Also, you'll catch yourself in reflections and stuff..|`|zpovg4U7aa	thats basically losing a little less than a pound a day, which is a lot really. one pound of fat is equal to about 3500 calories, which means you have to have that many NEGATIVE calories a day in order to lose a pound. even if you say you're trying to burn off 3000 calories a day, thats still a LOT.    i think you should set a smaller goal that would work better for you. i think its best that you exercise and eat healthy for a week and see how much weight you lose. then depending on that status, you should set a more reasonable goal that you know you can reach.    i believe that you are determined, but anyway, good luck!|`|djtrHXsbaa	no you will eventually look at your self in a mirror, at least accidentally, unless you confine your self to a room with all the mirrors and windows covered. .... not gonna happen.|`|CUMnu0OXaa	Good idea but it will be very difficult.  Try it.  Take a picture before and after as well.  Good luck, I wish you all the best.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	How are you going to make sure your hair looks okay before going to school or work?    What if you have a buggar in your nose? LOL    I answered your other post. No just act normal. You can see it in your pics already in your face.
5v6ovESbaa	Mash some avocado into some olive oil and leave it in for about half an hour. When its washed out it'll give your hair a lovely shine.|`|Wnmg850Paa	Depends on what you want to achieve. For shine the best I had found is Coffee and egg whites.       Use left over room temp coffee, about 2-3 cups (depending on the length of your hair) and a few egg white. Wash and lightly condition you hair then pour mixture over hair, rinse with cold/luke warm water and blow dry. Your hair will look like glass.
ihSvdnOvaa	You're pretty hot for a guy. I would do you.|`|PlVh12fpaa	your quite hot :)|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	You just posted about you and your girlfriend. Why would you think she needs a makeover when most rated her a 5-7?     NO and stop playing games|`|eX8i4vwRaa	if you are the girl, lmao, then no.. shes pretty like that|`|uoOIlAjRaa	Why is your avatar a guy?|`|mppB9ebgaa	stop with the glitter....more cleavage|`|6ix7aBSRaa	Are you a transformer? I hope that isn't you. But she doesn't need one.|`|fhy453voaa	u looking very cute no need makeover dear|`|TGHQW9FTaa	that's u why is your picture a guy with a guy name and i don't think that girl in the picture needs a makeover
q7TXVcldaa	I can tell you exactly why this happened.    Both Rue 21 and Hot Topic very often buy from independent designers and independent companies. Neither Rue21 nor Hot Topic made those jackets, and yes they are the same jackets, but they both bought from the same company or designer to sell back.    For example, Rue 21 buys a lot of clothes from a clothing line called "Jet Seal" not to be confused with "wet seal". Even though Jet seal is not Rue21 brand, Rue21 still sells the item from Jet Seal.    I hope this helps you!!!|`|mIj958p1aa	Both of those are some of my favorite stores. if they are the same jacket i'd go with rue21 since it's less expensive.  hey it's amor hilton! =X|`|gOOxQKNAaa	And Rue 21 is cheaper!    When companies compete, the consumer wins. ;)|`|JQMajdtvaa	that's so not cool dude.  i'm gonna start a petition.    not really, but still.  i love hot topic for it's stuff and rue21 for their stuff.    what is this world coming to damn it?!|`|EALy7X7Gaa	thats crazy i love both stores but never noticed how similar till you mentioned it. Ofcourse rue 21 has the cheaper deals. Idk thats soo frekin strange :p haha|`|xTaE8GLUaa	Both sell crappy stuff that falls apart WAY too soon.  Invest in nicer, classic, well made pieces, not cheap crap.|`|EWIXlEdMaa	these jackets suck anyway ,you should get more formal ones like the new york style
vXf2rrYraa	sally beauty supply.|`|0eq7uuyLaa	minkymonky.com....really good prices, great selection, and good quality, they won't fall apart like the cheap ones from the mall do.|`|aXqtzNIraa	If you want ball closure rings, then you can virtually buy any colour : http://lvepierced.bigcartel.com/category...    You can wear the horseshoes too (same site).    If you want bars then this site has good ones too:    http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_...    http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/body_je...
t46TPqgWaa	You could try a leave in conditioner or hair serum that basically gives the hair a layer of silicone type stuff, closing the cuticle and making it look in better condition.  Bleach basically strips the hair of everything and the only permanent way to fix it is to have the ends cut off when they have grown a bit longer.  Sorry - not very helpful I guess...|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	Olive oil! or any oil like mayonnaise. And any protein like eggs will work wonders.|`|F2z6orzYaa	put mayo on it , it makes it soft and shining. just a little bit,in the palm  of your hand. good luck.|`|Wnmg850Paa	you may need to get a trim and then start putting cream, deep conditioners and things like that on it.
zpovg4U7aa	i have a purple and black one that i got from neiman marcus, but it was quite a long time ago. maybe look on etsy.com; they sell handmade things and you can find basically anything in there. its fun to look around.
AFkmdu92aa	they would be cute and you probably couldn't tell but they would be row end if you walked in snow of rain:(    i hope it helps:)|`|MRwb4jQYaa	I actually have those shoes, and they're more like houseshoes, so I wouldn't suggest wearing them outside.  They are extremely warm, but not weather proof.|`|JQMajdtvaa	no. they would get wet. they're more like slippers.  go to forever young shoes! they have boots like that.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	I did not see a question.     All I have to say is Ughhh they remind me of those Ugg boots which I find freakishly ugly. They look like a ducks bill quack quack! lol    Hon go for some really cute fringed moccasins or go to a country/cowgirl boot shop and get some nice ones with fringe. Please no Ugg or slipper looking Ducks Bills............those are out dated.|`|PGfQNIOLaa	yeah i agree cuz you wouldnt want to get it wet  i think u should just search around sumthin good is bound to show up
ihSvdnOvaa	Your doable, if I had a few in me.|`|u7o75zipaa	You're cute! I'd say.. 7/10 or so.   Your best pic is the third. It's just fun and casual. Doesn't look to try-hard.   Worst pic is the last - doesn't do you justice!    Nic x|`|PlVh12fpaa	your really pretty girl :)|`|P7esu1eJaa	ayyyyyyyyy add me on myspace...    www.myspace.com/kurtisg_93|`|AA11944162	Your a beautiful girl so be confident on yourself. I would give you a 10 girlie. =]|`|aOx2hovgaa	hot|`|tGVp5fyJaa	definately hot!!!|`|YZFk1Eu4aa	You are average. Certainly not ugly, just an average teenage girly. :] I'll rate you a 6.5 out of 10, just coz I feel your look is really common for a teenage girly.|`|CUMnu0OXaa	I agree that you are average.  Very sweet.  But I'd give you 7.5 out of 10    :D|`|6ix7aBSRaa	I'd probably do stuff with you, if you know what I mean. That would likely be all, though. I think you're okay.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	In the first picture you are the prettiest of the three girls.     I would rate you a 7.5    You have that look that when you get older you may be a hottie but right now hard to tell.     I would say average to semi hot.|`|h9y9xN4Naa	look avg to me..|`|KKhc5UiYaa	You'd look better without the stupid Boston Red Sox cap|`|TGHQW9FTaa	your hot in all the photos except the 1st one|`|4u9qI9Iyaa	u must like that blue sweater|`|vmcjN9iqaa	Nice!
AA10954444	There is this recently launched product that was developed by MIT scientists and that seem to be the holy grail of anti frizz. It's called LIVING PROOF. It won an Allure award. I saw a demonstration on QVC...where the developer put one of those iron steamers direct into the straight hair of the model...and nothing happened. Her hair was still straight, silky and smooth. I am so buying this product.  On the QVC website you can read several reviews...hope this helps.|`|P7esu1eJaa	well you could use hairspray or that one shampoo in a green bottle that says it stops frizzieness|`|2jMFurDoaa	frizzease  or simple hairspray will do it!    apply the hair spray before you straighten a section of hair. and its smoothes it    frizzease you can put all over your hair then straighten it|`|JxSM7ByUaa	dont straighten it then :)|`|hchZhKItaa	go to a store and by an anti-frizz serum they have it everywhere!|`|JzTg0hg5aa	use moose when you get out of the shower and is that doesn't help when you are straighting your hair rub dryer sheets [like bounce or something] on your hair and it will take the static away.      good luck [:|`|cyxdfCvBaa	the anti-frizz serum like someone previously said works very well, and it also prevents your hair from getting too damaged. also, you could maybe try a lightweight hairspray just to lock in the straightness, maybe a herbal essences one because they usually don't harden your hair|`|GHegLJdOaa	SweetHeart, gel is always a no no when it comes to straightening hair....gel along with moose...cream...lotions....they usually just make your hair sticks and then you'll look like u just came out of the shower alllll dayyy.         try hair spray and after you spray it, brush it and then straighten your hair...then when you are completely finished, spray it over with more hair spray...sounds like much but it really does work,  also, you do not HAVE to spray it b4 u straighten it if you dont want to....its just another step to assure you that ur hair wont frizz,      good luck!
V3adr5MYaa	http://www.prankplace.com/bodyjewelry.ht...|`|bOduFl9Baa	where can i buy novelty size condoms|`|NaENZSJRaa	y u want to be a face just get it priest its not that bad and u wont look dumb wan people find out u got a fake one. lol

4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	You could use eyeliner but I suggest you use  a brush instaed of a pencil since a pencil gives a line that is so straight and unrealistic looking|`|qCPnoKy2aa	Buy a tiny angled brush and use an eyeshadow about the same color as your natural hair color and "draw" them on with the angled brush, filling them in as well. It's a much more natural look and using a pencil and much less obvious.     The link below has great brushes for super cheap! Goodluck!|`|cf6BdTYUaa	shave them off and have them tattooed on some chinese women do this.. he he|`|lYjLrqzOaa	Maybelline eyebrow pencil, but try a dark brown-black and be subtle. Make sure you are getting a good shape and be sure to put on your foundation BEFORE you do your brows.|`|DMxfGWcXaa	like Caitlin said, an angled brush and some brow filling powder will work.     You can also use eye liner but when you use it, smudge it in a little bit so you don't see the lines and it looks more natural.|`|qnfkRZzKaa	draw in fast strokes with eyeliner or eyebrow pencil. please dont color it in like a coloring book x_x|`|3SoInX19aa	okay.  here's one suggestion:  fill in your eyebrow with brown or black eyeliner, or whatever color your eyebrows are.  lightly color/shade over them with that,  and see if it helps.|`|p8lNnrzqaa	use some eyeliner that matches your eyebrow color and just draw in the hairs and try to make them look natural
AA10849332	really all you need to do is take the jewelry out.    taking extra care to clean it while you're in the shower would be a good idea so that no dirt or bacteria gets stuck in it as its closing.|`|YAJrXPXuaa	Just take it out, but are you certain you want it to close?|`|n9Oq6Xigaa	Cartilage piercing will heal naturally unlike skin piercing which sometimes heals but often doesn't.

Wy47JwOQaa	I like the second one better.  It just falls over a body better.  I think that its the fact that the first one is tight on the bottom that makes it alittle less appealing.

M.A.C. has a good variety of choices to choose from.|`|r2gIyNKCaa	I love the Bobby Brown Cream that you apply with a brush. I recommend a Bobby Brown eyeliner brush.

bOG48O23aa	Put band-aids on the area your getting blisters but make sure there good band-aids NOt the water proof ones. For blisters to heal it takes a while you have to get all the bad stuff out from the inside. Get a pin and poke a hole and push out all the bad stuff but DO NOT rip the skin or it take forever to heal ( from personal experience) then put band-aid over the top. This does not hurt.   Your shoes will eventually stretch to fit the shape of your foot just keep wearing them.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Blisters usually take about a week or so to fully heal.  I've had my share.    Blisters from footware can be caused for several reasons.  The shoes being too big can contribute to this because your foot can slide around more, causing your skin to run against the side of the shoe more.    Some shoes need to be broken in.  The boots I wear when I'm working, for example, are leather and are quite stiff when new.  It takes some time for the leather to soften up.  Blisters can form during the breaking in process.    A new pair of shoes can rub on a part of the foot that isn't used to it and you can get blisters this way as well.    One thing you can do, now that you know where you're going to get the blisters, is but a baidaid or tape or blister pads over the area where you're going to get the blisters as a preventive measure.|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	bandaids on pinkys. ur foot is sliding forward and ur not used to the pressure placement. blisters about a week or so, drain it if there's pus and keep clean. show needs to be worn in gradually, don't wear new high heels for a full day of work or something, start slow. also, invest in some good insoles.|`|ZS5FI34waa	be careful shoes can be dangerous|`|3zzlLYEWaa	make sure that you don't wear tight shoes or anything on that can rub against the blister make sure that while you are wearing shoes you protect it put neosporin on it then a band aid on top the cream will help it heal a lot faster.

Liaflkrxaa	The label Silent Worth is from Japan.  It's made in China or Korea but mainly sold in discount street clothes shops in Japan.  I always hunt for them when I'm in Japan, I love them so much!!  I haven't been able to find any for sale online in the US, though.      The closest I've gotten in terms of buying Japanese dresses in the US is through ebay.  In Japan, a dress is referred to as a "one piece" so run a search with that term.    It's in Japanese, but you can see a bunch of their designs here:  http://esearch.rakuten.co.jp/rms/sd/esea...
4hHmNmDqaa	Nope. After straightening your hair, it will go curly again after a few days or after you wash it. But you can get your hair chemically straightened and it stays permanently straight.. my friend got it done. If you want permanently straight hair go find a hairdresser that can chemically straighten your hair.|`|zpovg4U7aa	there is something called the "japanese straightening" technique that some salons use to permanently straighten curly hair for a while (of course, your new hair will grow curly). some curly haired people gradually start to have straighter hair but that usually happens from baby to child, or toddler to child.|`|h0kk0P3Jaa	Sorry...but no.  Some peoples hair does change texture throughout their lives but that comes from a change in hormones and not from straightening your hair with a flat iron.  Hair is curly because of the way that it grows out of the hair follicle.|`|1c929fa481e141f4ea18889484c16f71aa	No but as you get older your hair's natural curl may begin to fall though.
MrkFNWs1aa	my bf has darkbrown eyes almost  black and i love his eyes soo much , he's sooo adorable when he looks at  me with his beautiful darkbrown eyes...  You should be proud of your eye color!    or use contacts if you really want to look different.|`|mb2Otvunaa	Where brighter colors than compliment your eyes.    You could also try colored contacts, even if you don't need them to be prescription. Would recommend Acuvue or Proclear.|`|n8ESpa3oaa	Certain colors will bring out your eyes. Try wearing a light brown. Autum colors would look best on you like maroon & a deeper yellow. Don't wear anything to bright...such as baby blue. That will only make your eyes look darker.     ...............I wouldn't worry about it too much. Dark eyes are sexy.|`|7gKnlz4Eaa	bleach. makes the whites whiter and the brights brighter!
zpovg4U7aa	although it's true that cream cleansers are best for your skin in the cold to prevent dryness, if you are looking to use a makeup-remover/cleanser, two-in-one type of deal, i would say get something that foams. it wont be cream, but in order to clean your face properly you'll need something that foams at least a bit.    clinique has a good one. its pinkish white, and it foams and cleanses off makeup and cleans your face pretty well. if you break out, i would say just bring a cleanser and soap with you.|`|672b5656d0344c959a7f6892a55f88ecaa	try clarins puremelt cleansing gel.    put it on your dry skin. first its a gel, then when u massage it it will turn into a oil(which will melt all ur makeup). then u use a little water and it will turn into a milk then u rinse it off. its for all skin type, gentle for your skin and gets rid of all the makeup.|`|r2gIyNKCaa	Lancome Cosmetics has a great Cream Cleanser called Cream Radiance. I've been using it for a while and really like it. I think you should stop using Cold Cream to remove makeup.|`|A7ovwP94aa	Baby Lotione and  Cold Cream are an effective and cheap makeup remover.

NqZFw3izaa	belly button piercings take up to a year to fully heal.. you've only had it a month.. it's still very new and very sensitive..     some puss is normal with a recent naval piercing.. but yellow may be a sign of infection.. if it's very yellow, feels warm to the touch, and has a bad odor then you should get it checked..    clean your piercing with non scented anti bacterial soap.. use salt water soaks.. and you can also use small amounts of bactine spray.. but don't over do it..    do not touch the piercing unless your cleaning it.. and wash your hands before.. and never ever use alcohol, neosporin, or peroxide.. they dry it out and cause it to heal wrong..    when in doubt.. call up your piercer and ask them.. or give them a visit and let them have a look at it..    i hope this helps..|`|aXqtzNIraa	You should go back to your piercer, I think it's infected. Plus there's doesn't seem to be more room around the bar, so if it swells anymore that could be really bad.    See your piercer and continue your cleaning and if there's still no improvement go to the doctor.|`|8f7499c9305e3e0c3d2784e92308020caa	theres no pic  but sounds like infection buy some hydrogen proxide and get a q tip and rub around it then get some neosporin|`|f2b9bac6ba2f1b4719753cb0987d5d4faa	You need to see a physician quick... it is infected and it can kill you if not treated early with antibiotics.|`|neJbYkJoaa	You need to take out the piercing and see a doctor.  It is definitely infected and some infections these days can get extremely serious and resistant to antibiotics.  See a doctor and forget about the piercing and think about your health.      You can also try some warm salt water soakings several times a day to help it heal, but it may need some antibiotics.  If the skin is broken down, peroxide will only cause more tissue destruction.|`|Z5Wm6lWFaa	SOunds like it just infected. You should get a small cup, alittle  bit of salt and very warm water and hold it over your belly button. It mite sting just a veeeerrry tiny bit but it will kill some germs also. OR you can also just get a q-tip and dip it in peroxide and kind of clean it till it bubble so you know it killing bacteria.|`|N2zX7qb8aa	i 'd say your body is rejecting it..|`|FW93xc6Raa	Well it's clearly infected.. it shouldn't have puss around it.    Do you know if you are allergic to certain metals? I'm assuming it's the same ring you had put in when you got it pierced, correct?  If not, it could be an allergic reaction to the metal, which could explain the bump.   You'll want to go back to cleaning it like they instructed you do when you first got it pierced because it hasn't healed yet.|`|AA11606818	Man I was looking forward to that pic..|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Where's the pic?    Just leave it alone, it will heal.|`|n8ESpa3oaa	It could be an infection, or it could just be your body rejecting the metal. Either way, it's fine. Keep it clean. Wash with soap and water twice a day and use sea salt. Navel piercings take a LONG time to heal. Mine took a year to heal and stop ozzing.     Good luck!     ps....I know it's hard, but try not to play with it! It will only make the healing process longer!|`|mA3ZAKVfaa	jessica n gave you the answer and give her your points also.

hrqC3EV1aa	Yes, its definitely worth it to spend more for a high quality ceramic flat iron. There are many advantages to using a flat iron with Ceramic Plates compared to the damaging Metal Plates that many low quality drugstore models have.     Flat irons with ceramic and ceramic/tourmaline plates are much less damaging to your hair than metal plated ones.     This site has really good deals on high quality ceramic and ceramic/tourmaline flat irons: http://www.simplystraighthair.com/|`|wrw92W0Taa	no just get a ceramic one at walmart because it is going to ruin your hair no matter how much it costs|`|nyeUUojFaa	yes it definetely is! sounds weird but, the more expensive it is, the better it is.|`|dxlNwGuWaa	I was bought some 100 GHD straighteners for christmas a few years ago.  They were the best straighteners i had ever used and havent had a straightener come close to that quality since.  However, both mine and my sisters pair broke within a year.  But my other sister still has hers running fine, as does my best friend who has had her pair of GHDs for nearly 4 years with no problems, and she uses them at least once a day.  So, i'd say it would be worth splashing out the cash on a 100 set of GHD's, but be careful with them and look after them.    I'm not sure how much GHDs are in the states, but if they are a bit pricey, try Babyliss 230's.  They cost me around 40, not as good as GHD's, but probably the next best thing.|`|GQ618DeXaa	i got a sxe at sallys beauty supply and it was only $60 and my hair is reallyyyy curlyyyy and it works really good i dnt even need to put anything in my hair and it makes it soo softt yu can use it to curl yur hair also|`|HHnQyjFBaa	Yes, it's so worth it. The expensive ones are always better quality than the cheap drugstore ones.|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Definitely. The straightener will be better quality, get hotter quickly and give your a better finish. Cheaper ones can frazzle your hair and take a long time to get hot.|`|NQ3puIrraa	yes cause ppl that pay at the hair dressers will pay more in the long run so ur better if paying $100 in stead of like 1000 a year|`|1xr6T6h0aa	I have a Chi, it was quite expensive... but so worth it!

AA12249160	For your eyes, I'd recommend MAC eyeshadow in Carbon, Vellum, and Urban Decay's 'Oil Slick' black.      Do the lower third of your lid in Carbon (ONLY up TO the crease), put a thin line of Oil Slick in the crease, and blend those two together well.  You don't want any harsh lines with this.  Use Vellum on your browbone, and then with a clean brush, apply Vellum over the black, also.  Vellum has a color-shift quality to it, going from white to purple.  You will definitely need a good mascara--MAC's Dazzle Lash in Black Dazzle is a good one.    For your lips, I'd suggest either going with a stained look (MAC See-Through Lip Color in Rose De Sheer gives a nice, berry-stained look) or put a berry/plum sheer gloss on, and then use a lip brush to apply a small amount of black lipstick over top of that.      For red lipstick, I'd recommend a cherry red or true red for you.  No tomato or orange-y reds, though.  Reds look great when blended with a bit of black; I also like to mix pink and black.  Women always stop me and ask what lipcolor I'm wearing, and they are shocked when I mention black!  YSL has just come out with a black gloss, but I always buy mine at Halloween (usually six tubes at a time lol)    You can do endless combinations of colors--for instance, for my wedding I used the red side of MAC's 'Milady' palette, Flammable Paint, and black eyeshadow to create a red-and-black look.  I finished it off with red lipstick with red glitter gloss on top of that.  You can even use brights (on a goth?  shocking!)--yellow fading to orange to red; on the lower third of your eyelid, and use a nude lipstick with a bit of orange or yellow blended out from the center of your lower lip.  Just try to keep the color family together on lips and eyes; blues are good with violets and black but not with reds or oranges.    There is a girl on YouTube who does the BEST makeup tutorials--her name is xsparkage.  You will love this one:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro0XuRV33...    She has mad red hair and uses every color you can imagine. Go check her out!|`|uKSsXz2iaa	mac|`|6zXpA0PNaa	I thought I was the only goth here.    I think the stuff you have on your lips looks nice! If you really want a nice, blood red lipstick, I'd get a Red Lipgloss from MAC. They last a long time. Something like a blood red rose would be nice for you. Not too dark. Just take one with you when you go out to buy one. That's pretty goth.    Eyeshadow, MAC again. The black is awesome as well as Bloody Mary's eyeshadow (they are hard to find in store, but I order them online). the black is abyssimal!|`|vXf2rrYraa	A darker color on the eye lid and a maroon or darker lip stick. Mac or Bobbi brown. ether one. other then that you look great.

XP4yah8Zaa	Can you live without girls? ;p|`|ZCSWk7RNaa	Some girls can live without make-up while some girls can't.  Girls are basically self-conscious on how they look and what others will say and think about them that's why they put make-up.   We believe that we are prettier with make-up on but in reality, it's not.   I have realized that what matters most is the beauty from within and not the physical beauty.   It's okay to put make-up but be sure that it fits with the crowd and environment you are with. I know you don't want to be laughed at having too much make-up on.|`|pKXFwmyDaa	Because it is art!

Every time I wear makeup (light makeup - like mascara and eyeshadow and that's it) for a concert or formal event, I notice how much more defined my features are. I just don't see the need to work on my appearance every morning, especially since those who start wearing makeup young, regardless of the quality, will make their skin age a bit quicker than those who don't.    Thus girls who start wearing it more frequently get "addicted" and just like looking nice. It's not that they need make up to look better, it's that they like looking nice and they feel that the extra time and effort is worth it.    Now caking on make-up is another story. :)|`|UE7giU7Laa	uh noo im 12 and i look absouletly hideous without make up even a tad masacra makes your face pop why dont every guy wear mkeup at least eyeliner|`|DtF1GCGDaa	Good question.

There are loads who want to keep their face natural    But makeup also looks good, it accentuates the beauty of a girl by highlighting her features and hiding her flaws.

Sure daily use maybe a bit much, but hey its fun when you dress up and get to look all pretty!|`|WelEvYwGaa	Because they were raised to believe make up makes them presentable and beautiful?    Some it actually makes them pretty others could do better without yeah.    I, myself rarely use makeup.    At most brown eyeliner maybe with shadow.|`|DDEbOin6aa	you can live without it.    I wear it because I took this medication that did not react with my skin well and caused lots of discoloration on my face.     other than that I think less is more.|`|Hxk9snJuaa	i like to wear makeup just to make me feel a little more confident ... i admit i have bad skin and i hide that with cover up. it's just to make myself feel more energetic and alive around people knowing i can have people look at me without staring at me in disgust lol    i just like to look good for myself... i can live without make up when i don't feel like wearing any|`|6AtLDz1Daa	guy, i swear to you the answer is it all have to do with sex> they wear make up cause they're a bunch of horny girls theyre always tryina be hotter than each other and popular than each other because they dont even know themselves and actually girls wear makeup is their way of saying im always thinking about sex.
0M6DSPQPaa	Yeah, I like Adam Brody.  It's a nice casual look without being slumpy looking.    I personally think Johnny Depp has the best style of any male celebrity, but not everyone can pull off that sort of look.|`|oDzOYMjDaa	I like them =] But I'm not too picky about what guys where as long as their clothes really fit...and not too tightly lol... Hard to find these days.|`|67qWgasgaa	yeah, except the first look should have a patterned t-shirt.|`|iQPGdEdiaa	yeah i think its very nice and sophisticated|`|DiIK3M18aa	First Ones Better!  Just Not The Shoes|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Yeah that'd be pretty cute :]|`|2XTkSV4daa	Yes! they're cool...really cool.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	Yes...|`|3Q3npR3maa	nooo|`|ctQLrbvIaa	no|`|OexSvLjoaa	hmmmmmmmmmmmm adam broody cool, yes these are good styles to go for
x0J8S5sWaa	I agree with Ryota. It just means they have a fast metabolism. There's nothing wrong with that. However I am sure it can be frustrating for someone overweight to hear someone say that if they themselves have a really hard time losing weight.|`|ncPdftafaa	don't be hating!|`|gRW5X4vZaa	Well, I have to admit that I am one of those people... I don't overeat but I am constantly working it off...    Think about it though, the people that do eat a ton & don't do anything & still don't gain weight are going to have it all catch up to them later on in life. So really, they have a pretty sucky deal.|`|1842c18e2b8f922c49d387bfc336ea46aa	nahh. it just means they have fast metabolism.|`|2XTkSV4daa	Yes! because they're complaining about something I really want!|`|6jN3g0x8aa	I used to be one of those people, but then I had to take anti-depressants.  Whilst I'm certainly not obese, I do have excess weight that doesn't look very attractive.|`|G2w8Dgtsaa	YES!!!!!!!|`|AA11634270	Not really. They want attention. Because they haven't accomplished anything else?|`|AA11422321	Don't beleive everything people say to you. The Maths is pretty easy, Either they are very active or they don't eat as much as you think.|`|OKgLlA0Raa	no...|`|zth3G2b6aa	well as a skinny girl, i say it sometimes but my friends who are not so skinny do hate it...lol but its just bc they know they need to work out and they know that i eat healthy and run 3 mi everyday and do things like snowboard obsessively.|`|1a38FtEcaa	hey! when people say that there not trying to throw it around or anything its just true. if it offensive maybe you should get some help.|`|e99f082baf624341f3874d3e40b80fe8aa	So you mean you hate me??  I would kill to get my skinny 40kg body to be a bit fatter.... no matter how much i eat, After 1/2 -1 hour my digestive system already finished digesting it and i feel i want to go to the toilet..|`|eXMI11kkaa	i hate it. i have a hard time losing weight. :)
OHfZFR31aa	I've worked in the industry for 13 years in the US and UK and have never heard of them, and they are not listed in any of the major industry directories - which means they do not have any big name models or major clients.    The only way to know is that if they ask you for upfront money for ANYTHING - classes, competitions, registration, deposits, photography, website listings, etc - they are a scam and not to be trusted.|`|wUs2qokvaa	I just googled it and no results for an agency turned up...    if they ask for any money or details DO NOT TRUST THEM...|`|s4KZRtF8aa	no
mzrNTI8naa	the auto-bronzant   which is like a cream    it makes your super tanned  and doesn't wash off  but it always washes out of clothes and sheets  xx|`|AFkjkqcSaa	I always ase the pump action lotion.  It looks like tar when it comes out but u can see exactly where you are putting it too.|`|4c6e5fb1f0696bd9f830f25619687d80aa	Personally I use they spray as it's easiest to apply and you don't get orange palms :] It's also a lot quicker and so much less painless - even more so if you get someone to spray you :D    Also it's easier to build up if you want ya tan darker!!    Hope this helps   xxxxxxxxxxx
9VB4uWhMaa	Proactiv made my daughters skin worse.  Everyone is different so you may just have to try different systems until you find the one that works best for you.    I've been using Mary Kay forever and absolutely love it.    You should look into treating your acne with vitamins.  Chelated Zinc is great for clearing up skin!|`|LUVBrg3Maa	I'm sure clean & clear is cheaper, I have used both and to me they both work equally as well. I also found that St. Ive's apricot scrub for blemishes and blackheads works well too. Good luck.|`|GByW4v5Gaa	Not proactive, it drys your skin out so bad.  I love clean and clear, they have so many different products for all different types of skin, they also focus on certain places that can break out, forhead, chin, nose and over all clean and clear is cheaper and you can find it at any local cvs or wal-marts and targets it is alot eaiers to get then proactive.|`|x59uoIpMaa	Both work, I am sure, but here is the thing: Use the whole line. Don't mix and match, or just use a few. Use the whole line, cleaner, toner, moisturizer and whatever else they offer. b/c all the products go together and will enhance each other. I have tried a few lines, both cheap and expensive, both hair and skin products, and it's true: the line used all together works wonderful.  I really love the Pantene curl line, I used everything, shampoo, cond, gel, mousse, and hairspray and frizz serum. My curls looked so shiny and defined.  Also I use the whole Clinique line, plus the makeup. I love the way my skin looks, plus I get compliments on my skin a lot.|`|AA11611717	I've used both and I have to say that despite all the raving about Proactiv I like Clean and Clear better. Proactive is expensive and it does dry out your skin easily. But that depends on your skin type. For me, Clean and Clear's three step system works faster and better than Proactiv at a smaller price. Either is good for clearing your skin depending one your skin type, but I would recommend Clean and Clear budget wise.|`|KrC3asyRaa	if you have blemish prone skin, have a go at trying this     Its Nutrimetics Clear Set  Its great and truelly works, Nutrimetics is a natural company and is one of Australias leading skincare companies.      http://www.nutrimetics.com.au/leanneleac...    Contact me and i can send you a sample and tell you how you can get it for half price.
U2gKeZMJaa	yeah it'll look really nice with short shorts.  if its too long tuck a bit of it in. it'll look great  or with a belt on your ribs/under your breasts.  so it goes out like a dress.|`|67qWgasgaa	I wouldn't necessarily change it, but pair it with some dark skinny jeans and uggs.    I also like the dress idea people had on here, and like she said, add some cute, colorful jewelery.      you should also buy like yellow extension pieces of hair and put it in there for I'm guessing the Super Bowl..|`|yklgeWm7aa	if your thin, wear it up, like showing your belly.  or turn it into a tube top.|`|SwOQjBZNaa	I think the cutest thing I've seen someone do is just wear some short shorts underneath and kind of rock it as a dress.  You can then do heels with it, some funky jewelry, or a belt at your waist.    Just have fun, make it your own!  And you can always tie it up if it's too big.
cvRscoQ3aa	That sounds like too much water to me but then again, I might not drink enough water myself. Water is a good substitute for sugary drinks like soda, so I guess in a way it can help you lose weight too.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	drinking lots of water can help you lose weight. It will help flush your system as well as help make you feel full throughout the day.|`|NJqH1PCNaa	yo some lady died from a water drinking contest, she went to bed and died|`|kauRr6X8aa	You don't need to drink that much water. It's going in one end and out the other. It's good that you're drinking water but 8-9 bottles is too many. How big are your bottles?. Try and have 8 glasses.   Drinking water wont necessarily clear your skin. You need to eat fresh fruit and limit processed food. You need to get exercise and wash your face too. Water has no calories so if you're drinking water and it helps to suppress your appetite then you'll be eating less and wont be gaining weight. It's not that simple though, you need to exercise too.|`|zpovg4U7aa	the reason they say drinking water will clear your skin is because it gets rid of some toxins in your body by flushing it out. but as the saying goes, you should do everything moderately. drinking too much water will actually cause more problems, including your body being unable to absorb the good nutrients. drinking water definitely helps you lose weight somewhat so that you are able to go to the bathroom more and push the food through your body more quickly, but too much isnt good! 8 bottles is a lottt of water. 2 liters will usually do for a day.|`|J9rj2JNzaa	the water will make you feel fuller so you wont want to eat as much and make you lose weight. water it also good for you because it will flush out your body. i don't know what it will do for your skin but it cant be bad.|`|Q5gG3R0Saa	The only way it can help you lose weight is if you drink water instead of soda or something like that, and if it causes you to eat less junk. Yep, water's great.|`|ZS5FI34waa	its good for you but its not going to clear your acne|`|60GmMBr7aa	JW?  and it cleans you body out|`|o0GPDE4Maa	As long as you drink water, and eat healthy, your ance should start to clear up. And  yes, it can lead to weight loss.|`|0Z2aBH0Daa	I think you will def lose weight because you are filling your body up so you're not as hungry, it's a recommended "trick" so keep it up, that's awesome!    You're also cleansing your body of all of the toxins, etc., it's sooo good for you. You should generally feel healthier. The clearer your urine, the healthier you are.    I saw a book that said that lack of water is the cause of many many physical ailments---The Water Cure is one of them--see   http://www.naturalnews.com/003202.html.  I think his theories could possibly be true and I would hope so!    Unfortunately I don't think that it affects your skin or will clear up your acne. Have you tried Proactiv for your acne? The system of cleanser, toner and acne medicine -- it REALLY worked for me, just do all the steps and try it for at least 2 months.     You just made me thirsty for some water! (thanks :)|`|2f31b4d39ae1b04efdb601126bd63100aa	Typically, yes, you will lose a nominal amount of weight by increasing your water intake.  It helps to remove toxins from you body, and the more you drink the less you retain, so you will lose a small amount of "water weight."  Basically, when you don't drink enough water your body preserves it and holds on to as much as it can in case it is not going to get any more.  When you increase your intake, your body realizes it will get what it needs and therefore does not need to store it.  So it gets rid of what it does not need right away.    As for the acne, I am not sure how long it will take to clear up, especially if that is the only thing you are doing.  I imagine it will take quite a while.  However, you are really helping your body to be more healthy, so even if it does not help with the acne, keep it up!  You are doing something great for you.|`|mvZTm2pjaa	yes, drinking lots of water will help u lose weight.   it wil also help u go to the bathroom more often because of all the  moisture ur getting in ur system by that much water.   and itll clear up ur skin very soon, also by using cleansers and moisturizers for ur skiiin will make a HUGE difference! :D    good luck |`|OodkdbdDaa	drinking a lot of water not only helps you feel more full but when you are dehydrated your fat burning abilities are impaired. They even start to burn less fat at a very low dehydration level, where you dont even know you are thirsty yet. So by drinking so much water not only are you staying fully hydrated but  you are supressing your appetite. often times our bodies mix up hungry and thirsty. its reccomended to drink a gallon a day.     also as for your acne, im sure that since you are drinking less sugar and such it is better for you but i would reccomend a face scrub or proactive, my friend used it and it worked really well for her.     good luck either way.|`|quWV59snaa	Well by drinking a lot of water daily you can actually get dehydrated...so said my physics teacher|`|AA10691904	yes water will help but make sure to also wash ur face alot with soap, every morning. I used clearasil or something like that to help and it works, but if u dont work then just use wharver u got like soap bar or shampoo or wharever to wash ur face frequently, Stay away from junk food and greesy food.
BvjPU3wkaa	I would definitely go with Cinema Secrets.  They offer probably one of the best selection of colours on the market.  Their foundation leaves your skin absolutely flawless.|`|BQY6itt6aa	its really expensive , but it would be  a lot more if you went and bought every concealer , foundation etc .  http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templ...|`|rPjgH9Mkaa	This will ultimately depend on whether or not you like mineral foundations, but I personally love them. Not only that but Everyday Minerals is one of the best mineral foundations that are out there (especially considering ingredients and price). Considering you are also a make-up artist, it is easy to use the same foundations over and over again without contaminating them by pouring the minerals onto a little plate or what have you. Goto https://www.everydayminerals.com/ order a sample kit (which is FREE) and it contains three small foundations, one concealer and one blush. Then you can buy a bunch of other small colours st $2.50 each or buy one of their kits where you can get six full size ones for $34. I would suggest getting a bunch of smaller ones though since you will be doing make-up on a wide range of people. Shipping is only about $4 and these minerals will last you forever! Not only that but they can easily be mixed to get different colours if you don't have the right colour on hand. There are also some really good reviews on youtube about this product so that you can get a better idea of how the product goes on etc. Feel free to ask me for some links to them if you are at all interested. As well, their foundations are natural and very non-irritating (and vegan I believe?), so they are well suited to be used on people with sensitive skin-types. I saw that you were worried about something that will be too cakey and well if you use a good primer and spray your kabuki brush with MAC fix plus before applying then you will not have this problem. (Instead of mac's fix plus you can use this recipe here: http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKmWd_Flp... . As well, they have different levels of formulations depending on how much coverage you will want. I really hope that this helps and good luck!
8y4sKzJsaa	It will fade eventually to a brownish color, of course.  All dyes fade at some point.  It more than likely, will last a pretty good time though since your hair is already so light (at least it has in my experience).  It will be a very dark, vibrant black when you first dye it though.    I'd suggest going to your nearest Sally's and picking up a black dye (not a box dye), and a low volume developer.|`|KwheCx4Aaa	yes, it will fade, I'm not sure how much it all depends  I used a shade of dye called "darkest brown" on my bleached hair (it was pretty light) and it faded to a crappy blotchy brown within a week.   Make sure you use a very low volume developer. (i used 10). I had to dye it twice!|`|h0kk0P3Jaa	Yes.  It will fade and you will probably have to re-dye it later.|`|Bl9MzpA5aa	Dye your hair a reddish colour first and then dye it black afterwards. Doing this fills in the blonde colour and lets the black hold better.    My mum does it every time she goes from her natural blonde to dark brown, otherwise hers just fades.|`|VZFXS2Itaa	I think it will fade out with washing. That's been my experience anyway. Since its just a small bit, if you get a box, only mix up enough to cover it and keep the rest of the box to re-dye as it fades :)
n5Dqb5JZaa	Could be anything.... Lack of pigment, an unknown caucasian ancestor, genetic mutation (how do you think Europeans got blonde hair), and yes, even nuclear radiation if your family's from Hiroshima or Nagasaki.|`|K7N0pkU8aa	its just from lack of pigment in those areas|`|ewixOpyFaa	it mite be because the nuclear radiation is giving u cool hair colors! :D   im jk i get that to bro i get red or white hairs and my hair is mainly black|`|1id6XTOBaa	maybe your dad aint your real dad.
livX6UG1aa	My parents got me one like that as a graduation present, because my grandma and mom both have their initals.

O7S6qGtUaa	yeah, totally!!!!  i love it! =]  yes, i would definitely wear that!  i would wear it with some cool, retro pumps, or maybe a pair of peep-toes! in black or a metallic silver or even a gold!!!  it would look so cute with a shall "choker" of pearls!!!  and a few sparkly, jewel toned rings that look like candy!!!!  yummmm!!! and totally hottttt!!!!  LOL!  hope this helps!!! =]|`|x0J8S5sWaa	I like it, but only if it was paired with the right stuff. I wouldn't wear heels with it, that might look a little too sexy for my taste. Instead I'd make sure my legs are tan and wear flip flops or ballet flats. I'd also wear one of those "half sweaters" on top.    Right now it's freezing cold where I live though, so I'd have to wait around 4 months :D|`|2XTkSV4daa	No, I don't like it.  I think it's a little short and too ruffled!|`|k2vvT6glaa	Not too keen on strapless dresses, but other than that I think it's pretty    Wear it with plain black heels that aren't too high    and if your hair is long, straighen it and wear it down    Don't wear any jewellery     ohh and some grey or white tights MIGHT look good (not too sure but it might work)     :)|`|d5t5XgfVaa	i would wear it to like a park in the spring time but in a different color oh and wear heels with it|`|SwOQjBZNaa	It's a little Britney-Spears-post-Mickey-Mouse-Club for my taste.  Like somebody just took a bunch of old denim trousers and made them into a corset dress.    http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/...    Don't make the same mistake as poor Britney.  Invest in something other than denim!!|`|Dr7hxYWQaa	If it's for a prom dress, then definitely not.    But as for a normal dress, it's a little short, so I'd wear it over dark blue skinny jeans with a cardigan.|`|C9JP3BQWaa	Yes,  I like it and I will wear it BUT it's not that attractive for the prom. You will just like a nobody in the party.|`|zon13nY2aa	My Sister has this dress!! She bought it last summer.    I like it, but she has only worn it once because it's one of those dresses that doesn't always suit the occasion. She doesn't really go clubbing much so she hasn't got the wear out of it.    It would be lovely for nights out through the summer and also for a summer holiday if you're going away this year.    In the hot weather I would wear it with a pair of wedges or gladiator sandals.    In the colder weather I would stick a cardigan over the top. Normally I wear black tights with dresses in the winter... not sure if that would look good with this dress but you could always brave the cold and go with bare legs.    x|`|t8gWcBaeaa	yikes.

For some people, it's easier to talk on the internet, since they can't see you.  Maybe just send her a cute message via facebook, and she'll get the message.  Or write her a note and give it to her at school.  If you get nervous, just joke around. That'll break the ice and make things less awkward, plus she might laugh, which is good.

mrDx1eaTaa	Cameras are bad, sometimes it makes an ugly person look better in a picture, (photogenic people), sometimes it makes it look like there are 10 pounds added.  First of all, if you want the mirror experience to resemble closer to a picture, you must have all lighting on.  The reason for this is because the lighting on cameras take away the shadow of the face made by the nose, angle, etc, which gives it the illusion that everything is so much different.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	i know i feel that way sometimes too! i think its just because on the camera it gives your face different lighting and changes up your feutures a bit sometimes its a good thing but sometimes not. Some people are photogenic but others not soo much dont worry too much about it i think mirrors are way more accurate than pictures.|`|YAJrXPXuaa	Yeah I get tht too...    Its just the lighting your in, It's always changing.    Beleive the mirror not the camera!|`|Ksriqfqpaa	well the flash of a camera might cause that  umm mabye ur a bit paraniod   haha idk how to spell that  but whatever  im sorry i didnt even help u sorry=\   hmmm  i really dont know what to tell u....|`|zpovg4U7aa	i hate this too, but a friend of mine had said that using a webcam will show you what you look like because its actually showing you left to right of what people really see of you, whereas the mirror is backwards.    for example, in the mirror your left hand is shown as your right hand. (if you were facing the mirror raising your left hand, from the reflection's point of view, it is raising its right hand). so your face is backwards when you're looking into the mirror.    if you turn on a webcam, it will do the opposite, which is actually the way people see you.    im not sure if this is true, but it seems to make some kind of sense to me. i dont look as good in camera pictures either, but i seem to like the webcam pictures better. but of course i like the way i look in mirrors best, but apparently that isnt the way people see you. :(|`|EE9F6q3Jaa	I figured this out like a month ago, and it's been bugging me ever since.  Your pictures are how you really like, and the mirror is a reflection.  what you see in the mirror is the opposite of what other people see.  in the mirror your right is their left.  so you basically see your self backwards in the mirror.  I now use a webcam to get ready and not a mirror.  I switched the side of my bangs and things like that, and now what i look is what i used to see myself in the mirror and even though i hate to look in the mirror now, i like how everyone else sees me.
6C1GL0QXaa	I suppose it depends on what belly bar you have really. A nice kind of sparkly elegant one would be cute, but if you have a complete trashy type bar.. It makes the situation a whole lot different. Lol :]|`|NzVQs41yaa	i've got one i had it done when i was 13 and i'm 16 now, to be fair on a lot/ost people they do look a bit whoreishhhh! but mine is just the sort of thing my boyfriend sees or people see when i'm on the beach in my bikini. if you hegnerally walk around in crop tops and short skirts and stripper boots up to your thighs then yeahh with the piercing you will look a little more slutty hahaa!|`|xb6mEIECaa	i love belly button piercings ! and all piercings for that matter . im geting my belly pierced in a few days :)|`|qFL8AhJJaa	Think They Are Very Sexy(No Homo In A Girl) Im Getting One Soon|`|eXMI11kkaa	i think they're a bit too common. but if you like it, go for it!|`|hIk0lWT2aa	I used to have one.

If you do you'll end up becoming wicked fat, very fast. Just work out. Gain some muscle. What you wrote makes you sound super skinny, and sickly looking. Just work out, and eat right.

Hugless, I feel your pain. However, trying to gain weight by eating McDonalds foods will not only make you fat, but it will overdose you on other chemicals which are bad for your body and could potentially kill you in the long run. How old are you? If you are 14 or under (I'm 14 as of 27/04/2009) then you have probably not hit puberty yet. Though this is rare for girls, it is still possible. In that case, you will most likely gain weight through the natural course of time. You are naturally anorexic, however there is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, I thought that guys are more attracted to those anorexic whether natural or not. You really do have nothing to worry about.

In the second one it looks a little frizzy though it's hard to tell from the quality of the picture.    So I wouldn't change it. Besides, you have fairly dark skin and lighter colors might end up looking unnatural. Whatever you do, don't go blond. Medium browns to jet black are probably your safest bets.

MYgNCPzcaa	If done correctly it will not damage your hair. Wearing extensions is a protective style. When wearing a weave you need to be sure that your natural hair is moisturized (you should deep condition your hair before having the weave installed). If you get a full head weave then all of your natural hair is protected; this is the best way to grow your hair or to just give your hair a rest.    When plaiting your hair you can add a little extension hair to the cornrows to ensure that the braids last longer. If you choose not to add hair that is fine the only downside is that the style may not last as long. You should not wear a weave longer than 2 months, if you wear it longer than that that can be damaging for your hair because you need to shampoo and condition your hair as well as let it breathe.     I recommended that you do not wear you weave longer than 6 weeks however 2 months is the longest you should go.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	The drawback with the plaited weave is that it does tend to look bulky and unnatural, so the flatter they plait your own hair the better... But the flatter they plait it, the harder they have to pull, which will probably entail some yanking and breaking of your own hair. If you go to a good salon that's skilled at plaiting flat without pulling, and the plaits aren't too tight, it can actually thicken and grow hair if you're lucky. It did wonders for mine. My hair was actually thicker and longer once i took it out. If you decide to go for it, don't leave it in too long - 3 months max - and wash it regularly. The other drawback is the tons of dead hair build up, but once you've undone the lengthy process of removing the weave, unplaiting your own hair underneath, and you've brushed away all that dead hair buildup, it certainly shouldn't be any worse than before you put it in.. However, having said that, every head of hair is different. Some people can never get on with it, and it does break their own hair. It never did with mine, but it's hit and miss.. I moved on the bonding one years ago, which i find better and more natural looking, but again it is hit and miss and is more expensive. Basically, find a very good salon. If its done right, it doesn't have to do damage.|`|eHUJOD0daa	it does tons of damage to your natural hair  unless the weave is breaided on to your natural hair|`|TYRRjIv4aa	yes tons of damage|`|Un3hiHpUaa	yes they do damage your hair really bad, well what i have heard of, i have even heard of people being in a lot of pain with weaves.  You can see how bad they are for your hair on americas next top model, etc :)|`|fSjbwxUIaa	Not at all as long as you know what your doing. Never braid without synthetic braiding hair no damage to your hair and always use a net, keeps it ventilated and your able to oil your scalp. Make sure you shampoo and condition once a week and make sure your braided hair is always fully dry.
35oAq889aa	I'm a boot freak so maybe i can help you out.

DDfGgK86aa	put a black band on. so it will camaflouge it.|`|uqWdNf3Faa	I always used bobby pins instead of a hair band. you dont need very many, maybe 3 to 5 and just place them going from the outside of the bun towards the middle near the scalp.|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Use a hair band to tie your hair into a normal ponytail, and then twist it round and secure it with bobby pins instead :]|`|fb7721ad747d2c6d87fb2b8481cf7ff7aa	You could always try bobby pins instead of another band on top or a pretty hair scrunchie or decorative band instead then its not as  plain. Or try a band that similar to your hair colour so it dosen't stand out as much.|`|ZO3Vd6dpaa	You could try using bobby pins, they will be next to impossible to see if you get ones that are near your hair color and are pushed in all the way.  Use a band to put your hair in the ponytail, then pin the bun in place.  It's going to be hard to hide the band for a bun-a simple ponytail is easy but a bun its harder.|`|fSjbwxUIaa	Before you twist your bun leave a long thick group of hair out gather the rest and create your bun.With the long group of hair use this as a band, and once you've wrapped the bun with the long grouped hair you can now pin it with the bobby pins.

aTEPG0Mraa	mm thats how i cut my hair the first time i cut it :) well it depends what style ur going for.     i would suggest the first layer after the base. if ur hair is about shoulder length or an inch or two below... but if it isnt. cut it about 4 inches from the base. then about 3 inches above that for the next     i only really go for 3 layers base middle and top  so its really ur choice and side fringe or bangs w/e. only advice is  make sure u only cut like half an inch at a time ands check what i like so u dont stuff up the length its embarrassing ive had friends do it|`|m4KFa7yiaa	well if you want bangs you cant pull them back, you'll have to clip them back   and the length depends on your face really.  http://www.visual-makeover.com/face.htm  you might find that helpful      the layers i got are really good for making them curly (although i never keep it curly)  theyre all around    hope that helps (:

soByAneVaa	I've never heard of Winners but I can give you some advice and point you in a direction. (I won't go into detail about the ed hard site since it's already been addressed.)    If you go to the Asian site that's fine if you don't mind counterfeit items. If it comes out of China it's almost always fake. Although many popular companies off shore to cut down on expenses, none of the big ones that I can think of off shore in China, the counterfeit capital of the world.

And you can also take a look at ed hardy on ebay, where its not by much, buts sometimes like $10, $20, $30 cheaper so you could take a look there.

Sounds like yours is not too short though.  To make your face look thinner you should try to elongate your face.  With straight thick hair, a hairdo that would look pretty and slimming on your face would be to take some front pieces, twirl them once or twice, and bobby pin them to the top of your head, creating a small "poof".  Also, adding angles that fall below your chin will also create an illusion of length to your face.  Hope this helps!|`|nEg8crOGaa	i have a chuubby face also angle the hair near your face or get it cut in layers|`|zth3G2b6aa	you want long layers. a chubby face cannot pull of short hair.|`|BDZGHSc3aa	You should check out the websites I've listed under.

If I can't be bothered putting on full foundation, I just put bronzer on.

If you're still in doubt, just contact the seller and ask for more pictures or angles to help you determine whether they are real or not.    PS: Usually they have weird logos (nothing like the original ones), strange boxes and don't come with a small paper/certificate or sheets that explain proper boot care.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Ugg Boots are real if they come from Australia and are made from sheepskin.

9wtpCNb6aa	Cotton clothing is extremely popular. A majority of people own some type of clothing that is either totally made of cotton, or contains at least some percentage of cotton. It is a very comfortable material, and many people love to wear it. Did you know that there are several different types of cotton? Well, there are lots of different kinds of cotton that are used for clothing.    Heavier cotton that is found in sweaters for the fall and winter is called Canton Cotton. It is soft and difficult to pull apart. This is the most popular type of cotton, and most people are familiar with it. It feels a little like flannel.    Organic Cotton is a little bit harder to come by. Regular department stores normally don't sell items with organic cotton, but there are many online retailers for it. Organic Cotton is grown without chemicals. All of the harmful pesticides used in typical growing processes are absent from the process of developing this cotton. Even in the manufacturing process, organic clothing is not exposed to the environmentally harmful chemicals that other materials are exposed to.    Another type of cotton is Bamboo cotton. This type of cotton material is 30% organic and is very, very soft. The use actual crushed bamboo mixed with the organic cotton to create clothing. It is all natural, and chemical free. It is better for your skin and for the environment.    A lighter flannel-like cotton is called cotton twill. It is good for fall wear, because it is a bit lighter than canton cotton.    French Terry cotton is slightly heavier than cotton twill, but not as heavy as Canton cotton. It is rather soft and has a short nap.    Honeycomb cotton is a lightweight type of cotton that dries quickly.    Egyptian cotton has longer, thinner fibers. This type of cotton creates strong yarn that makes nice and smooth fabrics.    Yet another type of cotton is Oxford Chambray. It is a medium weight cotton.    Regardless of the type of cotton that is in your clothing, you can always tell that it is indeed cotton. It has such a unique feeling and texture to it. Cotton material is great for sweaters, underwear, pajamas, shirts, shorts, pants and practically anything that you can wear. It lets your skin breathe. Most people like the way cotton clothing feels on their body.    Some people have found that they are allergic to cotton. It could be a particular type of cotton that is used for their clothing, or a chemical that is used in growing the cotton or manufacturing the clothes.    Organic and Bamboo cotton are really good for the environment because they don't use many of the harmful chemicals, like dyes, pesticides, and other things that pollute the environment. People who think that they might be allergic to cotton might just be allergic to the chemicals in non organic cotton clothes. The process of growing cotton and making clothes can potentially involve heavy use of environmentally harmful materials that contribute to global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer. Thankfully, some companies are making strides to make more organic clothing so that the things that we wear are 'greener'.|`|2IuoHrjQaa	Go to a place that sells cloth, and ask them about the cotton. Take samples of them, measure them and then wash them at different tempretures... See what comes out best!.. ie softness, shrinkablity, what irons best (remember cotton is hard to iron, and prone to shrink) and hopefully you will end up with a great garment!  Good luck in your new business.|`|ctQLrbvIaa	100% COTTON OF COURSE!|`|vXf2rrYraa	egyptian cotton is pretty soft.|`|3Q3npR3maa	wool|`|qaP03QImaa	organic cotton , no pestcides better for the planet, better for the farmers less risk of irrritating skin.
edAtsw3waa	It sounds like your skin wasn't completely healed before you got your tan. Try exfoliating the areas of dark patches to make it appear more even.
WoRnK6L0aa	You are exfoliating too much. It's making the problem worse.Make a thicker paste out of Baking Soda and Water. Apply to face and let sit 15 minutes. Rinse with warm water. Follow with a light moisturizer.    Clean your skin: soak a cotton ball in either lemon juice or apple cider vinegar and apply on face.    Mix 2-3 tea bags to some basil and cook in boiling water for 10-20 minutes. Then apply on the acne with a cotton ball.    Saturate lettuce leaves in water, use water to rinse face and acne.    Grind bay leaves and blanch in water, Cool and apply on the acne.    Boil water in a pan, add some apple cider vinegar. Cool, put a towel on your head and bend over the pan.    Apply some toothpaste on the acne. Do NOT apply on skin because it will make it dry, only on the acne spots.    Whip the egg white and put on face acne until it drys and then wash with cool water.    For exfoliation use lemon juice and sugar as demonstrated here:                                                                                        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOhbn9C6S...    You can also make your own home made pimple patches like Clean and Clear by applying OTC acne medication to the pimple and then applying a round band-aid over it. The heat and the band-aid help to concentrate the medication on the pimple. Do this at night obviously and you should see significant results in the morning.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	If you have an oily skin wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the pimples like soap.The secret of keeping the skin clear is to keep it oil-free and clean. If you have a dry skin honey is a great remedy for acne and pimples because the honey kills bacteria. If you have a combination skin when you wash your face, use sugar to scrub it, at least once a day, for two weeks to rid yourself of acne.Try  http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/ for more info.|`|L6BOtQ6haa	Go to your GP and get him to get you some cream. I got some stuff called Duac which was awesome|`|AA10811426	Eat better - more fruit and vegtables    Drink lots of water 2L/day    Spend time in the sunshine - it helps dry out your skin and gets rid of acne.    See a doctor - you can be put on prescription medication to help you.  Don't wash our face with scrub 3x a day - you are irritating the skin and causing it to become more dry - which in turn makes your body produce more oils to combat that.    Wash your face 1x a day with a light soap, I highly recommend Cetaphil? Gentle Skin Cleanser if you have that near you (http://www.cetaphil.com/Products/Default...   - after that only splash a bit of water on your face.    Good luck - I know its hard.|`|uqWdNf3Faa	tea tree oil actually isn't hard to find. it is at the grocery store.  make sure you are drinking plenty of water. the healthier your body is the better your skin will appear.   you could take lemon juice and apply it to the areas with a q-tip overnight. the pimple will not be gone the next day but it should be smaller. it will itch, just resist the urge. you can also do the same thing with toothpaste.  after you wash your face, use a toner with salicylic acid in it. then a moisturizer that is oil-free. moisturizing is important so do not skip that.   also, during the day if you feel oily. wash your face again and repeat the process.|`|eHUJOD0daa	i use toothpaste as a facial scrub  it help A LOT with my bad acne  it reduces the size of it all and most go away  try and get toothpaste without anything added to it- cheap store brand ones are good|`|k2vvT6glaa	- only cleanse your face twice a day (morning and night)  - if you're going to use a scrub, make sure it's a gentle, daily one    (you can use this as a daily cleanser, but if you have a harsher scrub,      use it only once or twice a week)  - Tea tree oil etc isn't hard to find, the body shop sells it, or just pick up       a spot treatment gel from the pharmacy  - If you still don't want to buy a treatment, lemon juice is supposed to        work  - Drink lots of water  - Don't wear foundation or use too much makeup  - Eat lots of fruit and vegtables  - Don't eat too much greasy food    If all these things don't work, try proactive or dermatalogica     :)|`|hIk0lWT2aa	Have you tried Proactiv? It's phenomenal how good it works!|`|FjyqdUqeaa	i agree with 'sanfrangirlie'   except where she said was your face 1x a day   only ever wash your face 2x a day ...   when you wake up in the morning ..   and before you go to bed :)  if need be just splash water on your face in between  with no soap, scrub, wash, etc.  you'll be okay .. acne is never easy but it'll pass  just take care of yourself    pro activ would probably be the last option in my opinion   it's pricey .. and didn't work for me..   ( only dried my skin out .. and didn't actually get rid of the puss inside the pimple .. just dried it and left it under the skin which is gross )   but hey it might work for you .. everyone's different    goodluck x  ( don't worry you're only 13 .. people in your class/school will catch up with the acne lol .. you're just an early boomer )

aXqtzNIraa	That's a great idea, to see if you like the design or not.    Someone once told me, to sketch out your design and put it on your bedroom wall, if you're sick of seeing it after 6 months then it's not for you!    This site is really useful for tattoo advice: http://www.tattoojohnny.com/first-tattoo...    It has a section called "tattoo test drive". you can buy transfer paper off there, it's VERY cheap and it lets you print designs off the computer onto the paper.    I hope that helps.  X|`|udtrniV4aa	sometimes temporary tattoos do not fade fully and you can be left with smudges or parts that do not disappear, just get the real thing.|`|kCdISEGqaa	This may sound silly, but it works. I make temporary tattoos for my kids using water slide transfer paper, and clear, adhesive paper. What you do is print the picture (in reverse format), onto the water slide paper. Allow the ink to dry completely, then, peel the adhesive paper and apply the clear side to the pictures on your water slide paper. Make sure the adhesive paper is pressed firmly onto the water slide paper, because it will help the tattoo adhere to the skin better. Cut the picture our, and peel the adhesive off. Apply the tattoo to the desired spot and hold it for 10-15 seconds. Then, using a wet cloth, apply pressure to the back of the tattoo, and slide the backing off to expose the picture. It sounds like a lengthy and difficult process, but it works, and it gives you a good idea of how your tattoo will look. These papers are typically available at Office Depot, Office Max, or Best Buy. Call them first to find out though!!! Have fun with it and good luck!!!|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	what the...just go for the real thing. it hurts so bad that it feels good!!! in just got a 5 in by 5 in lillie on my hip...mmm it felt awesome! take a friend to hold your hand.|`|t36Dce0Laa	Ummm You can use colored pens!|`|zUJfvMPeaa	you can use markers for it.  http://sn.vc/tricks522

It wont be too different just a bit shorter, bobs are really in fashion at the moment. And if you are really feeling adventurous then you could cut in a side fringe or full fringe.     EDIT:    But for the best results don't cut it your self, get some one you trust like a friend to at least help you.     Also have you ever tried been a hair Model. I got a hair cut at Toni & Guy once for just 10 becuase a student hairdresser cut my hair. I was great value for money!!!    Any way good luck!!!|`|NBjta8Kyaa	if you tie it up in a pony tail    and cut the pony tail off    you will have like a V shape haircut    lol  thats all i can think of    or cut yourself a fringe|`|505kdpepaa	Shampoo and condition your hair at home, pin it up wet and go to your nearest SuperCuts on a weekday morning. It'll be really cheap, maybe 11.99? But gosh, don't cut it yourself. Recipe for disaster!|`|zZ9UbXJwaa	The recession is awful isn't it? One thing I've done myself that has worked in the past is this - pull your hair into a ponytail and chop up and into it with your scissors, this will give it a choppy effect.    If your hair is too short to do this comb it out in front of your face (so you have a long fringe that covers your face), and then grab this with one hand and twist it into a tight twist, then cut across with your scissors. This will give you a choppy and shattered-looking fringe.|`|Fd4EBV1Vaa	Ooh don't cut your own hair, it will inevitably go wrong. Try and get someone else to do it. Many salons will cut your hair for free if you are willing to be a hair model for a stylist who is training. If you must do it yourself then here are some good instructions http://www.howtodothings.com/fashion-and...|`|jNmj8nPFaa	You really should try to find some wher cheap to get it done instead of cutting it yourself.  But if you cant find anyone and you just want to cut it yourself then shvae it shorter in the back and leave it longer in the front for side bangs and spike up the back. If you cut it your self try to find a picture of this style that you like and copy that, so you dont do it guessingly and also have atleast a friend there to help you.

They probably dont look half as good in real life with their hair that way, its all down to lighting to. But generally different hair styles suit differnet people, depending on the shape of a persons face, or even skin tone and whether it compliments the hair colour. Its not down to just distinctive features as such just all features, including hair length and style! Confidence is deffinatly a winner too though, confident people get away with a lot|`|jrzcV406aa	It depends on your face features...

HkuOYQKZaa	yes, everyone is different.a good indication is your mum or grandma, if they started later it just runs in your family, don't be worried, if your still bothered pop round to your doctors, they can see if anything is wrong, although i'm sure nothing is.|`|839f7x40aa	This just might be the way you're going to be for the rest of your life.  Look at people like Nicole Kidman; she's in her 40's and doesn't have a womanly figure.  Unless you're a late developer, it all comes down to having our own totally different body shapes. You've probably heard this a billion times but it's the truth.|`|Iek7D2hOaa	depends what you mean by late teens.  if you mean about 18 or so, then it's quite possible you're just a late developer - puberty can go until someone is 20, so yeah. it's not unheard of, but it's a little uncommon.  if you're worried though, go to a doctor (:|`|vvlLXjOdaa	I'd say most likely very normal.  People come in so many glorious shapes and sizes, from tall to short, round to thin, and more.  Maybe you're still developing or maybe you just have the genes in you for a boyish figure.  Take a look at your family. Parents, grandparents, and so forth and compare your figure to them.  See if you're developing in a similar fashion to any of them.|`|e99f082baf624341f3874d3e40b80fe8aa	Its normal, but if you want yourself to be the hot curvy type, sorry to say, at most you'll be just B or C,    Although if you are just 15, then you still have a chance..
fZw6ImUGaa	If it's too long, there is not a lot you can do, try to strand where it doesn't show. If it's too wide just use a peg between the shoulders to make it more narrow. The cuffs can just be turned around to the inside and fastened with two needles.|`|67qWgasgaa	Could you take it to a tailor, it won't cost $300..|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Try and shrink it in the wash.|`|oiPrycbJaa	Boil it in hot water, it'll TOTALLY shrink.

cieM9vIzaa	The best way that I know of to get a "Mood Ring" or any other type of "Mood Jewelry" to become permanently "Black" in color & stay that way is to simply not wear the "Mood Ring" for an extended period of time (months, even a year or years). . keeping it in a cold & dark place.  Eventually the "Liquid Crystal" which does the color changing will revert back to its natural/normal state; which is a "Black" color.  That is why on some "Mood Ring Color Charts", the color of "Black" on a "Mood Ring" is stated to reflect the mood of "Nothing"; which means that the "Liquid Crystal" is "Inactive" & "Not Doing Anything" at the moment.  It is only when heat is applied that the "Liquid Crystal" reacts & changes color(s).  Placing a "Mood Ring" or any type of "Mood Jewelry" in the refrigerator and/or freezer will only turn the "Mood Ring" "Black" temporarily as it will begin to display different colors once it warms back up.  Exposing the "Mood Ring" to warmer and/or hotter temperatures will cause it to change color(s). . not turn "Black".  Exposing all types of "Mood Jewelry" to water can damage it.|`|SwOQjBZNaa	Be stressed, nervous, or tense 24/7.    It's a mood ring, bud, it adjusts to body temperature.  If you like it black so much just buy a black ring.|`|zth3G2b6aa	you have to maintain the mood that causes it to turn black.|`|4KgKHhycaa	I agree with the first answer..    But what i always used to do was in the winter, i would leave it by an open window so it would get really cold. If you don't have snow outside, put it in the freezer. The black should last until it is warmed up.    Although it would be easier to buy a black ring.|`|jrB6z23Yaa	Its a mood ring right just observe in what mood of yours it remains black and try to remain in that mood always.    Dhruvika  http://www.myjewelersplace.com|`|oiPrycbJaa	geeeeeez    why cant you just buy a black ring?????    -__________-|`|67qWgasgaa	Water always makes it turn black, so try that.
rfFCPjr5aa	I don't know if the Bill me later option will extend to the UK. But a few of the online cosmetics retailers do offer it, to US based clients.|`|MdhRRPHjaa	try see this http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3300354-1...
hE7fK4W0aa	wear  an aliceband|`|HMgRFOhqaa	Lock yourself in your room for a few weeks, and throw a couple of tantrums...|`|JjoLo4e1aa	shave ya head , thats quick and easy, then cut ya mums fringe off while she is sleeping|`|n7vsfdplaa	pin it back until it grows out then get a profesional cut|`|SwOQjBZNaa	Pin them back with bobby pins if they're long enough.    Otherwise, I'm afraid headbands are your only choice.  Lots and lots of headbands!    Sorry love, cut them yourself next time or bring in a picture so you control the length!|`|BDZGHSc3aa	Sweetie, all I can say right now is work with what you got. It's hard not having a visual of your hair. But just bump your hair with a curling iron. Don't tight curl it, just enough for a cute day out. You can even grab a long piece from the middle and swoop it over. Good luck.|`|cW2ypuXBaa	clip it all back like your pisplay picture lol|`|h73d3wJ2aa	go to a hairdressers ASAP.    And go past a shop that sells hats, you may need it for a few weeks|`|LHdrMQc0aa	go to a hairdressers and get them to make it into a side friinge, it may be short, buh it will 100% look better and grow out quicker.|`|g5000MHBaa	put ya fringe back|`|dqMDEbaBaa	Get it cut professionally if you have time. If not by some discreet pins and thin your fringe by clipping you hair back.|`|rIgiBayiaa	Argh i had that before it was awful! go to a hair dressers and ask them to cut it into your hair so it doesnt stand out much and thin it out! i had too, and although it was still short it was bareable looked pretty nice actally! dont touch it yoursef though, you'l only end up making it worse i think!|`|O23lK3IUaa	Clip it back {just the fringe}|`|yfMmr7uGaa	Get one of those double hair bands so you can put one really near the front to keep your fringe back and one slightly further back so you don't look weird.  One of these...  http://www.corrinesmith.co.uk/tn_double_...  Couldn't actually find what I was looking for but that's the kind of thing I mean    Or you could french plait it down the side.  http://img154.exs.cx/img154/9974/249623c...  Wouldn't matter so much if bits fell out if you wear the rest of your hair quite messy too|`|rCLAIs1saa	pin it back till it grows a bit?    either with a headband or grips
NfwJPdLjaa	Dye it blonde again?  Lol. What do you mean? You have naturally blonde hair  and you put brown streaks in it? Then dye it blonde again  :P
P0EAzyw8aa	if you have just had your hair coloured wait a week to re dye it. dont use a thick moisturizer if you are going to colour it will act as a barrier, shampoo only then condition after you have dyed hair and leave the conditioner on for 5 minutes to re hydrate the hair. Root touch up after 6 weeks, no need to re colour the rest of your hair, this is how people end up with different tide marks through out their hair.|`|m5aenb6qaa	as soon as your hair gets longer it needs a re-touch for the roots to get the same color. however, they say it's 6 months.
78m1v4imaa	It may make you feel pale, Alum as far as i know pulls your skin, purses it, a better way might be to say it tightens it.   Folks used to use alum around there eyes and mouth to tighten out lines that might make them appere old and unfashionable.            used with powder and makeup it can be spectacular, it can also hurt with prolonged exposure so ive heard. and i Think ive also heard it may be dangerous to ingest
VYMOwgc3aa	No matter what haircut you have, it will stay the same color.     If you want it a different color then dye it :)    |`|gvnNy7Rtaa	Nope!  The length has nothing to do with color and won;t change it.|`|AKHywxwlaa	no|`|3IXDx9nhaa	Mine does because any colour/foils etc. and sun bleaching is cut out when it is cut shorter.  If your hair is naturally this colour all over then no it won't.  I would tell your hairdresser that you may want foils as well when you make your hair cut appointment and see what she thinks on the day or you can have the cut and make another appointment for foils the next week.|`|aSUCLiWHaa	no silly you cut your hair is doesn't mean is going to change to a different color
