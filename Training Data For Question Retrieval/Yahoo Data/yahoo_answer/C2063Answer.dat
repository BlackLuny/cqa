The person getting best answer gets an additional point for each thumbs up. Thumbs down does not affect points.<br>  <br>  The person receiving the best answer receives 10 points. It can be selected by the asker or put to a vote. To choose a best answer do one of the following. If the question is yours you can select a best answer after 4 hours. You will have 4 days to do it. If it is someone else's question you will have to wait 4 days if the asker does not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	I think many people don't KNOW that you are supposed to (or CAN) choose your own Best Answer. From many of the questions you see, often folks don’t bother to read the rules or figure out how things work on here. They just jump in and start asking "silly" questions and let them expire by default. It's a shame, but how can you truly "play the game" if you don't learn the rules first?<br>  <br>  That is why I belong to TieBusters, a Yahoo Group that is dedicated to voting on all those old, tied questions. The link is on my profile page.|`|ce610883b4ac82c9a4aba8fa2bd1ebdeaa	For some people, they forget to go back to the question in time.  I've had questions that I wanted to choose best answer for but didn't remember until it was too late.  Then there are other questions that people ask and feel that it would be better for others to decide what would be best.  And even still, some people are just evil and join the site to enrage people such as yourself by not even caring about people's answers.|`|BlOYJ4gvaa	I totally agree, since I put a great deal of myself, personally into answering.  This is time I take away from important things I should be doing.  I feel that if I can truly help someone, that I feel fulfilled, at least for the day.  Since I respect the serious questioners, it would be nice to get a little respect in return.  Seriously!<br>  <br>  Also, I have all responses emailed to me, so I never revisit the questions or answers, and the only way that I know if my answer helped someone is to receive an email telling me that my answer was chosen as best.
C6jFigESaa	Thanks for bringing this to my attention. <br>  <br>  Like the first member "Yahzmin" suggested, you can report the abuser via the REPORT ABUSE link next to their answers, or better yet, you can copy the URL of the spammer's profile and email it to the staff at:<br>  <br>  y_answrs_team@yahoo,com ( the missing E in answErs is deliberate.)<br>  <br>  Then tell the staff you found a spammer and wished to turn her in.<br>  <br>  If you do this, I guarantee you success.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  <br>  Rest assured it is my pleasure to help you. So please don't hesitate to ask for more information. <br>  <br>  In order to copy the URL of the spammer's profile, you must first visit her profile by clicking on her Avatar, then copy the URL in the address bar ( i.e.  www.yahoo.com).  <br>  <br>  To copy URLs in address bar:<br>  <br>  1. Left click the URL in the address bar so the address becomes gray, then right click on it and select "copy"<br>  <br>  2. When composing your letter to the Staff, right click your mouse and select "Paste" from the drop down menu.<br>  <br>  That's it.   If you are still having dfficulties understanding how to copy and paste URLs, refer to link below for more information:<br>  <br>  (Copy and Paste URLs)<br>  <a href="http://www.webmasternow.com/copyandpaste.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmasternow.com/copyandpaste...</a>|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Basically, you can report it. That's about it. Yes, they suspend the account. Yes, they often just sign up again. Yahoo does what they can. If it happens enough, they will flag the IP and try to permanently block them, but even that does not help much, since people can reroute and use 'fake' IPs. So it is up to us to help and just keep reporting them. It is sad -- but it is the way things are on this site and in the cyberworld in general.
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Yes, they do. 'They' are restricted from posting anything other than 'standardized' responses, but they DO read them.

If you have a natural aptitude for the subjects it's a good start, i.e. if you are studying languages or art and it doesn't come naturally you will probably never manage it. In the same way if maths is very hard for you, it's possible you'll never get an "A".<br>  <br>  Obviously you need to work hard but try to read any literature over and above the course work you get.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	I see two problems. First the employer must change the social security number if told to. They must also make any corrections. If they will not then attach a statement to your tax form explaining it and use the correct amounts in your computations.<br>  <br>  Second both your husband and the company can get into trouble if your husband is really an employee and not a contractor. There are specific rules as to the difference which you can find at the IRS web site. By not treating him as an employee they are trying to save on all the taxes. The big problem is that your husband must pay his own social security and medicare as though he is in business as a contractor.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|UHTcpdkVaa	His employer needs to get his records correct and refile.  Unless he wants to get audited by the IRS and fined to filling an incorrect 1099.  Technically, since your husband is not the SSN on the 1099, then he doesn't need to do anything about it.  In reality, he should insist on the proper documentation to avoid being audited for not reporting income.

It takes awhile to get a return reply sometimes you have to ammend it a few times...I did and it worked a couple times for me...Just make sure you follow the rules.|`|suPD7c3gaa	You don't delete your Yahoo! Answers account.  The only way you can cancel it is to cancel the entire Yahoo! account, which would include your Yahoo! mail and any and all Yahoo services you may be using.  Basically, what you do is simply stop coming here.  You can set your questions and answers to private so people can't see them by viewing your profile.  To do that, click on "My Profile" on the upper right, or your avatar to get to your profile. Then click "Edit My Info". You'll see the option to make your questions and answers private. When you do that, any Contacts or Fans you might have would still be able to view them. If you'd prefer they didn't, also select the option to not allow Fans or Contacts. This step would eliminate any Contacts or Fans you now have. Be sure to click "Preview" and "OK" to save your changes.  Then just don't come here anymore.
KN36rGMvaa	Because some Levels have answering limits.    Level 1, 2, 3 and 4 are restricted and Level 5, 6 & 7 have no limits.    Here is a list of what points are needed for each Level on Y!A.    Level 1 > 1-249  Level 2 > 250-999  Level 3 > 1,000-2,499  Level 4 > 2,500-4,999  Level 5 > 5,000-9,999  Level 6 > 10,000-24,999  Level 7 > 25,000+    I presume the answering limit helps cut down spam and makes a Y!A user want to come back and answer more questions.        Cheers  -Will|`|R4KqEJekaa	because you have limit question to answer and itisok you can answer the next days
AA10671142	I agree with you. I have had some of my questions deleted for no reason at all. I don't cuss or rude to anyone. I have reported some for cussing and rude to me and nothing get done about it. when I email yahoo they tell me that I violated the rules when I know I did not. I know some that have two or three accounts open and nothing is done either|`|ktsPCsBjaa	it would violate privacy<br>  <br>  people can get pretty aggressive over little things like being reported. if someone were to get hurt because they reported abuse then yahoo could get in a lot of trouble|`|NAhsHPYsaa	I guess for everyone's safety.|`|m4yMJ55daa	It mite start A war if they did|`|xngu6kkqaa	Cuz you might kill them|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	If someone wants to block me, then it is their right. I haven't asked questions, so no one could report for that.<br>  <br>  I have answered many, many questions. And I personally don't know if anyone has reported any of my answers as a problem.<br>  <br>  I don't see them as a problem. <br>  <br>  I have only reported two persons, one question, one answer that went WAY beyond COMMON DECENCY.<br>  <br>  One was removed, one wasn't. I don't fully understand what Yahoo is looking at, and that is fine. It is their decision. THEY have to draw the line somewhere.

Once I got top contributor in beauty & style because most all of the questions went to vote and I voted for me (:|`|cN6lZk63aa	i think we all do that .|`|BTCtT6edaa	Of course. If my answer is the best I will vote for it.|`|KN36rGMvaa	Yes, If my answer is the best answer I will vote for it.    If it isn't, I will vote for a different answer.

Personally, I think the voting system could be altered beneficially, say, points towards best answer for "thumbs up" and points deducted for "thumbs down", then maybe there wouldn't be so many deadlocks. Just my opinion, though.|`|FycEnv5haa	OBV OBV OBV.  like you do.
44b4fdd7ed7cc42e599ec8a9302e9632aa	yep
380FLuAuaa	If you click the thumbs down button it will take the answer to the bottom of the page. If you scroll to the bottom you Will in small black print the words you gave this a low rating. After that they will have the word show in blue. If you click the word show it will show the answer. Than you will see the answer with the thumbs down in green meaning you clicked on it. On top of the answer you will see the word hide in the same color blue if you click it it will hide the answer.<br>  <br>  Just for a warning if you give more than one person a thumbs down and you click on the first persons answer it will come up just fine but if you Click on the second person that you thumbs downed than the words will be cut off and it will screw up the bottom of the page. It is better to look at one answer than to hide it than look at the second answer than hide it and so on. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped you figure out your question<br>  4wheels|`|50UbJp14aa	if you thumbs down it does not take away the question, keeps it there but hidden every time you view the question, if you thumbs down an answer, it does nothing to the question,  if you want the question out you have to report it, also the same goes with an answer, but an answer will be taken out if 2 people report it.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  <br>  Ernest|`|DFfRc56Iaa	Thumbs down aren't enough to report an answer.<br>  They mean someone read your answer and disagreed with u.<br>  Sometimes it happens to be someone who's stalking u and u even don't know I've displeased the user.|`|L1DUcTtSaa	Thumbs downing someone wont get rid of the question it will simply minimize the answer and move it to the bottom of the page.
5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	O nce your questions and answers go to the vote or resolved they become the property of yahoo and stay in yahoo archive available for searching and browsing and only the yahoo team can remove them.                            But you can make them invisible with the following steps.        * Blank out your avatar to the grey silhouette.      * Change your nickname or just leave it blank.      * Close any links to your 360, and email.      * Delete your open questions and answers.      * Set your Network and Q&A to private.      * Delete your contacts and fans. To delete fans block then unblock.    Then just leave it. After you've applied the alterations no search will find your Q&A,s.                                                                   You can then close that yahoo account and open a new one if you want.
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sorry, but no record is kept of outgoing messages using the Yahoo Answers email links. You have to keep track of them yourself, somehow. We've asked them for some type of ability to do this, they have promised we will 'eventually' get it, but not yet.|`|DFfRc56Iaa	It says message sent successfully.
673739cc8cf9ce9f1a5e007efbd067bcaa	Some people just ask questions and never intend to pick best answer, don't have time before it goes into voting, do not know how to pick best answer, do not have a good answer so they let it go into voting so they can pick no best answer, forget about it until it goes into voting.  It is not right if someone takes the time to answer  the question the asker should take the time to pick best answer.  Good luck!!!|`|yxdjQ3E5aa	I don't like it at all. But there have been a couple of occasions where I will completely forget that I asked a question! So I will therefore never get around to choosing a best answer, but when I do finally get back to the question I always vote for the best answer.   I think other people should at least do that, so a best answer is chosen sometimes.    :)|`|KN36rGMvaa	Some people prefer to let their questions go to vote, and some aren't interested enough to bother choosing a best answer.        Cheers  -Will
RznLZGm2aa	WOW, this really SUCKS!  My first question is did you sign a contract for any of this stuff?  Meaning you said they put a cell phone in your name, if you never signed a contract for it there are things you can do.  The same thing holds true for the car, you say they bought it in your name, but did you sign the contract or did they sign for you.  If you did not sign for it, and they signed you name then yes there are things you can do.<br>  <br>  However, on the other side if you did sign, you are over 18 they can and will try to collect from you.  If this is the case and depending on how much you owe you might consider contacting an attorney, either to go after your folks for the money, it doesn’t sound like they have much, or for bankruptcy.  If for no other reason to explore your options.  <br>  <br>  With regard to the food stamp thing, while crappy there is not much you can do.  Yes you could contact the food stamp people and let them know what is going on, but the reality is your parents could just boot you to the curb and then you would really live someplace else.  Which based on all this sounds like it might be a good idea.  <br>  <br>  Some friendly advice, it sounds like it is time to leave the nest, i.e. move out on your own.  I would suggest you find a place to live and split the cost with a few roommates.  It would not hurt to contact the university to let them know what is going on and maybe setup a payment plan to take care of the debt and hopefully you can get back into school in a semester or two.  Don't give up on your dream, while it might be hard it will be worth it in the end.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Your parents aren't playing nice.  <br>  <br>  Shut down the playground and no more toys or cookies for them.<br>  <br>  They are forever in "time-out".<br>  <br>  Riddle me this Batman?  Do you ever want to get married and maybe get a house?  Even if your hubby to be's credit is Perfect, your credit will be an obstacle.    Disown the deadbeats and don't accept any more "presents" from them.    Nice birthday present - a phone that messed up your credit for them???  What are you getting for Christmas?   The gift of them letting you paint their house? They will let you pick out the paint and just put it on your account that they opened up in your name at Home Depot.
ejSoKvLkaa	yeh um i dont wanna badmouth yahoo because they suspend you for anything|`|KVVvKHsAaa	I DONT KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE WEIRDOS O_O|`|tEOXLJo5aa	Must have something to do with who gets voted Most Useful  or Best Answer or whatever more often.|`|Vu91r84faa	Contributor means that you give an answer to a question... Being the best means you've shared a lot by answering questions... yes it would seem unfair but try to see the logic, if you ask, you got the whole world to answer your question regardless of whether it's wrong or right (that i think is the reason why asking costs more points coz you got a bunch of answers in return).. And if you answer, You are just one of those who are in the "world" that could give an answer.(well to some your answer may be the best or the otherwise, so its okay to give you less points)      For me it's not unfair...      I hope it helped...
suPD7c3gaa	The best way is to click on their avatar to see if they allow email.  If they do, you, of course, also have to have chosen to allow email, or you wouldn't be able to email within Yahoo! answers.  All email addresses remain anonymous at all times when emailing through Yahoo! Answers.  So in your case, since you don't allow email, you would have to go to your profile, and just the to right of your avatar, click the option to allow others to email you through Yahoo! Answers.  Again... no one will ever see your email address when emailing through Yahoo! Answers.<br>  <br>  When replying to an email send from another user through Yahoo! Answers, be sure to click the "Reply to this message" link that's provided with the email.  You DO NOT click on the "Reply" button like you would with your regular emails.
KN36rGMvaa	You cannot vote someone as a "Top Contributor".    "A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category.    If you mean choose Best Answer then;    Wait for 4 hours after you submit the question and then go back to the question, you will have a blue tab under each answer, "Select As Best Answer", click the tab on the answer you consider to be the best. Rate the answer 1-5 stars, add a comment if you wish, click submit. You have selected your best answer, you get 3 points back. You're done.        Cheers  -Will|`|suPD7c3gaa	There is no vote for Top Contributor.  Being a TC has to do with answering a lot of questions in a particular category, and getting a certain percentage Best Answers of those answers.    If you meant to ask how to choose a Best Answer from the answers to one of your own questions:    Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.    If you meant to ask how vote for Best Answer from the answers to other peoples questions:    Go to any category and click on the "Vote undecided questions" tab.  There you will see the list of questions that have gone to voting for the Community to vote for Best Answer (when the asker doesn't choose).    Both of these things can be done at ALL levels.  The only thing that can't be done on Level 1 is rating thumbs up or down.

Once you are level 2 you can. I know it drives me crazy too as Im still stuck on level one as well. You are still at level one.. so if you keep getting best answer.. you will be there in no time.. Once you are on level two they will light up and you will be able to give people the thumbs up or thumbs down.|`|y9vqyqeNaa	You have to reach Level 2 first. You need 250 points.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	You can see what happens for yourself, if you look at all the answers above, some were posted together, some others a few seconds later, which probably means that this question was answered by 4 people at the same time, sometimes there is a time lag on answers posting depending on where the question was posted.<br>  <br>  The answers used to be left in the order they were posted, but the system was considered to be unfair as the first few questions gathered all the votes from the voters who only looked at the first couple of answers before voting and moving to the next undecided question. Now that the answers are shifted around, the voters still vote for the first few questions but the vote is spread more equally amongst the answers. If all the answers are basically the same,you have as much chance of getting best answer as anyone else whether you answered first or last.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	It used to be that the answers WERE left in order during voting. Then, people were accused of 'squatting', answering with a single letter or something to get that coveted first spot (which always seemed to get more votes) and then editing their answer later with a full answer.<br>  <br>  YA randomized the answers during voting to offset this unfair advantage. So, the situation you have brought up is the result. This is a problem, but not nearly as widespread as the initial problem, in their eyes. Sadly, that means that in the circumstance you have described, you will just have to take your chances and hope that your answer shines for other reasons than simply being first.|`|suPD7c3gaa	It really doesn't matter whose answer was first.  It's still up to the asker to choose the one they want.  If the question goes to voting, we should still read all the answers before choosing one.  Sometimes the answer is basically the same but one might be worded differently, or more clearly, with more or less detail, etc.  Sometimes those things can make a difference in how a like answer is perceived.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	although in many cases that is true, don't dwell on what shouldn't matter. good luck!|`|AA11603244	Yes you are right|`|f2AWSb48aa	Yes you are right|`|0KgrjTgtaa	If 2 people click on the answer button around the same time, they won't notice that anyone else has said the same thing until after they've answered.|`|vpRERM9jaa	because they want the points or sometimes they answer around the same time and don't realize it
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	The problem with Cheers' wonderful answer is that there is ANOTHER big reason people do this. To HIDE the fact that they are trolls. And if both the good guys AND the bad guys hide behind private Q&A -- how can you tell which one is what?|`|S4W7FojCaa	If you add them then you can see their QA...I done it once lol but the guy took me off his contacts.|`|R4EYPeLGaa	Because of trolls stalking my questions and getting them deleted.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	what do u want to see?|`|5Ra5xbziaa	i don't know why|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Different people do it for different reasons.<br>  <br>  Some keep their Q & A private to avoid having other users "follow" them around Y!A through their questions and answers.<br>  <br>  Others have had trouble with trolls and even stalkers, and keeping their Q & A private is a way to elude the troublemakers.<br>  <br>  However ... a LOT of Y!A users keep their Q & A (and their contacts) private to disguise the fact that they cheat (point-game) by asking questions with one account, answering with another account, and giving themselves Best Answer.  They also use their second account (some have many more than 2!) to vote their other account's answer as Best Answer on questions that are in voting.<br>  <br>  Since we cannot see their Q & A or their contacts, we have no way to prove they are cheating (although it's obvious) so we cannot report them as point-gamers.|`|fR2wFN3taa	To be frank with you,from my point of view,I feel like kinda being read by others...i go out there answering and while I was answering...this thing would keep on buzzing in my mind.."man your Q and A is being read by others..you lose privacy....etc.."<br>  <br>  so its like a bank locker where everything is safe...<br>  <br>  But I partly agree with you as well,that it would be better if everyone could read others Q and A.<br>  <br>  nice day!|`|1LB7NBhcaa	well for one theres people out there who violate for violation sake so i dont want any one being a so called a and  friend as alot do it just to say you violate|`|IDxF6URVaa	i dont!|`|AA11408911	I can think of the following reasons to justify a user making their profile private:<br>  <br>  ? Privacy <br>  ? Protection<br>  ? Prevention<br>  <br>  Firstly some users will use Yahoo! Answers to ask very personal questions and would prefer that some members of the community, even family members do not have access to such questions. <br>  <br>  Secondly, many higher level users make their profiles private to protect their accounts from trolls, abusive community members who will target members of the community to harass and purposefully report questions and answers provided by such users. Making their accounts private offers some protection.<br>  <br>  Finally, prevention. It is good Internet practise to maintain a degree of privacy on line.<br>  <br>  [ I would also have to agree with Yahzmin's answer :) ]<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs

Key0d96raa	It's really nice the way you are looking out for your friend.Before i answer your question i'd like to say"continue looking out for your friend"and be nice to her.They won't get annoyed of her ,on the other hand,it is the guidance counseller's duty to talk with the student/s about whatever the student feel comfortable talking about.It's the guidance counseller's duty to give her advice and guide her in the right direction.However,she really need to continue talking to the  guidance counseller or teacher/s and get stuff off her mind so it won't distract her schoolwork and/or lower her grades.That is what they are getting paid for.....right.She just need to tell the counseller the whole truth about whatever is bothering her so she can get help as soon as possible before it start affecting her grades.If she want, the guidance counseller could call in her parents and try to settle it.If she feels comfortable doing that.If not ,she could explain  to the counseller and the counseller will find another legal alternative to help solve her problem.Everything needs to be straightened out so this young lady can feel at home and connect with her parents again.Take care and continue being a good friend to her,ok.

C6jFigESaa	Hi dear,<br>  <br>  Well, this all depends on whether you are reporting a user maliciously and incorrectly.  (i.e. reporting Dad for no reason at all).<br>  <br>  But if the member is constantly harming the site, rest assured you can report the user each time he/she violates Answers code of conduct.  Moreover, members with a high report status can only remove 5 contents of a reportee's. This is to prevent targeting. However, the rest of contents you reported that were not removed will be reviewed by a real CC ( Customer Care), and if your reports are valid, you have nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  Yes, negatively targeting a member may result the termination of ones account. <br>  <br>  I hope this clarifies  for you.<br>  <br>  UPDATE: Let me clarify for member "Yahzmin"<br>  <br>  Your report status does not necessarily go down when you report a reportee 5 consecutive times.  The reason you are ONLY permitted to delete 5 of a reportee's content ( as previously mentioned above) is to prevent targeting. <br>  <br>  There is no evidence that one's report status goes down when you report a reportee 5 consecutive times.  But it is true you are limited to remove 5 contents at a time as a TR ( Top Reporter).  Only 5 times. Then you can go on again to report someone else and remove their contents 5 times "again", but this varies on many factors, including the trust level of a reportee, etc.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	rather depends on why, don't you think?<br>  if it's just a spammer, it's not worth your time.<br>  if you don't like he political views then it is harassment.<br>  <br>  <br>  "I think it just means that the other user is stalking the other user by watching questions, checking their profile daily and reporting them."<br>  <br>  that is harassment.<br>  i've had someone do that to me.<br>  specifically, my questions.<br>  however i don't know who it is, or how to figure out who it is.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If you report the same issue over and over -yes.<br>  <br>  But a spammer (like in dating) sometimes has multiple posts - and can get reported more than once.<br>  <br>  I report spammers immediately - and have never been told that it was too much.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	i think it is. i personally don't report people as i understand that they are entitled to their opinion but i have had people threaten to do what you are describing and i was told that they are "trolls"|`|tdQTZPI7aa	The bigger issue is Yahoo will not delete a question if it abides by the guidelines even if 10 people report it.

That way the asker could see how many people agree/think it is a good answer.<br>  <br>  The asker can thumb a question down - that way people can be dissuaded from answering questions with 'I don't know' or just copying and pasting pages from the wiki or being rude.

But if you know the correct answer to the question and see that someone else gave an incorrect answer, then you can thumbsdown them and the asker can then see how many people disagree and make a better judgement as to which answer is correct.|`|SHanivxvaa	OOOh yes sometimes you go out of your way to answer a question and people just do it cause they want to be on top god its just a game i say who cares and i noticed when iam really honest that,s always thumbs down would people just prefer us to be fake then|`|OX3tG9ndaa	Yes and no, <br>  <br>  a lot of times people just give the thumbs down for the sake of giving thumbs down,<br>  <br>  but other times, it's nice to know other people's feedback other than the asker.|`|EFZRSqFcaa	It would fairer Bex if YApoo blocked the IP addresses of multiple account holders/users.  ;-(|`|yKdrOYEoaa	no|`|niivsTVxaa	To be honest i think the entire 'Thumbs' System should be removed, it is constantly abused & that abuse has made the 'Thumbs' system almost useless anyway, as many people know that a lot of the time: Very good answers receive thumbs down, and bad answers receive thumbs up. although this isn't always the case, it is a frequent occurrence. <br>  <br>  Personally i think even if we just allowed the questioner to give 'thumbs up/down' does that really mean they are going to rate any differently than random users, ALSO this would mean that any 'thumbs up/down given' could cause people to abuse the questioner, as they would know exactly who gave those ratings.|`|AA10077992	The message board idea is possibly better - with stars +report abuse only

There is usually a Choose as Best Answer button under each person's answer. So just wait a day and then click on the blue button that says Choose as Best Answer. That should do it.|`|DCofdauLaa	if you find an answer you like best, then there's a button under the answers that says "Pick As Best Answer" or something along those lines.

6qsTmMQaaa	You cannot add the photo directly to the question. However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	You need to have your photo on any online site below are some you can use among <br>  many.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://photobucket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://fotopic.net/" rel="nofollow">http://fotopic.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.snapfish.com/info17" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfish.com/info17</a><br>  <br>  Then copy the URL link and paste it to your question.They all have different ways to copy the URL link.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Because users were abusing the ability to create private chatrooms and Yahoo wasn't able to monitor the activities going on inside such rooms (child pornography!), this feature is not available anymore - at least not on Yahoo.

AA11307940	You can save your emails in folders. Make sure you give the folders a name. Open the inbox, click the email to move to a folder, then click Move, click New Folder, name it and it is automatically in there. Any emails you want in that folder, click the little box next to it, then click Move, now just click the named folder and it's in there.Many are doing this now, because for some, Yahoo has lost their mail in the inbox.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	If you don't delete the e-mail then it automatically saves it. Just don't delete it or spam it.
3uqHPEFDaa	I believe it is not possible to do what you're asking.<br>  The sender name is included in the mail message at its origin not at the end.<br>  <br>  Maybe, just maybe, for the mail that arrives without a sender name, it is possible to use your contact book to add that name to that particular address. Still, I don't believe it will work.<br>  <br>  Try submitting this question to the yahoo mail support:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/original/forms_index.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/or...</a><br>  <br>  It's the second link on that page.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	I don't think so.
