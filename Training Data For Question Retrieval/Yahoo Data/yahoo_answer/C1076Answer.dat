R3SH9tPWaa	I think it's stupid, yes.  While Deion Branch is overrated and Ahman Green is speculative, the Vikings defense and Randy Moss are simply racking up the points.  At least hold out another week before you make a rash decision.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I know you said it's a five-year league, but you want to at least get off to a good start.  Focus on year 1 for right now, not year 5.|`|AA11307592	hell yea your stupid, your giving up randy and vikings d!!!  for a sucky raiders d, jones who doesn't even play much, only you get lj outta the deal.  bad!!!  well, hope this helps.|`|Oe4tJ21zaa	BAD MOOOOOVE - DO NOT DO THIS... LJ hasn't proven himself yet, stallworth isnt getting as many passes with welker in. and raiders D??? please. you be the man ant take your nasty recievers to the super-bowl baby..<br>  <br>  <br>  Fantasy Football is a way of life...
AA10940228	Vincent Jackson.<br>  <br>  Jackson has the most potential from the list provided.  Curtis will not likely see more than 60 yards from McNabb; Crayton has to worry about the best NFL defense.  If you have second thoughts, Toomer may be another option, but be careful here.|`|peJMG09Baa	If that is your options, you are pretty much screwed at #3 receiver.  None of those guys will see a lot of balls this coming Sunday.  Every once in a while, Toomer comes up big, so I would go with him.
7ee90e37ed8e1e5a99baec3f6b19f43aaa	I'd start Kevin Curtis.  He's due for a breakout game and eventually Donovan will get lucky and stop overthrowing him.  (Sorry to criticize you Donovan, but some of my best friends are black...)|`|p5o3LchTaa	neither go get B Marshall of Den if available wait on Curtis and Jackson both in bad O this year.|`|gX0hcBBlaa	who or who???? i say go pick up a better WR hahaha
d0c2ebZsaa	That is tough I would probley go with Evans and Marshall|`|d3a18ab2cee83575828a0e316f6c6761aa	Lee Evans and Brandon Marshall definitely.|`|iOpu2yF8aa	Evans and Marshall|`|mBYOuzSMaa	whatever you do DONT start lee evans this week, i have him too, but not starting bad idea
6c5e9c0198bb47dba3083e056a33d9d7aa	Wes Welker<br>  <br>  NE is going to have to pass the ball alot to beat Dallas this week... he should get 100 yards and 1 TD<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|yY0RtHmNaa	I would take out Chambers and put in Bowe from here on out.  Even though KC isn't doing to well in the standings in the NFL, Bowe comes up big for them every game.|`|9fEfQH1Maa	ok|`|kYeqMT8eaa	If taking anyone out, remove welker. Chambers is do for a big game against a weak secondary... welker isnt doing a lot with moss/ stallworth getting the lions share.
38b0f3f3c60255bdf08f21c057999758aa	I think the only person you can start if you want to have a chance of winning is Rivers.  He's playing Denver, which doesn't have the greatest defense, and as compared to Campbell (playing Detroit, which should be able to contain him) and Frerotte (who is a relative nobody on a beat up team counting down the days to the bye week), he's your best option.  Start Rivers, and good luck.|`|Bfi6bIXnaa	First of all, Denver has the #1 pass defense in the league, and 2 of the top 5 cornerbacks in the league. So to say their defense isn't that great is not exactly fact over fiction. And Rivers by the way sucks this year. Campbell plays Detroit who is not exactly a killer on D-Remember the Philly game? Start Campbell. Frerotte is too big a risk. Rivers sucks.
19a1c881ea84521524ef022c3e1ff596aa	Unless your in a keepers league Heath Miller is your best option. The steelers have been pass happy this year and the Bears offense is shaky along with the TE battle between Olson, Clark, and Gilmore. Heath will have a much better year.|`|1Y1vOqFcaa	Miller has been a solid target for Big Ben all season.  Pittsburgh schedule isn't going to get much easier for the rest of the season, so expect the Steelers to be throwing more often.  I'd stick with Miller for the rest of the year.|`|6Z9Om7j1aa	Olsen is still a rookie who share time with Clark in CHI. Miller will put up way better numbers for the rest of the year. I dont know about TDs, but Miller will get double the yards Olsen will get.|`|d0c2ebZsaa	Olsen looked good the other day but I like Miller the rest of the way|`|9edf5d40c71316153bd15164c8e8f7a4aa	i like Olsen. the thing about TEs is that you aren't going to hit gold every week like other positions unless you have Gates (Dallas Clark & Witten have had good stats to this point)  & waiting another week on Olsen probably isn't going to tell you anything.
Mf2a8RWLaa	I would play Hasselbeck this week, Warner would be a good pick up but see if you can trade Cutler for a WR before you drop him.  He does have value to you.|`|20xKcRYRaa	Hasselbeck is an every week starter and I think Warner is a great pickup.  Cutler has good potential but obviously hasn't done anything.  Stallworth would be the better pickup having Brady as his QB.  He's not guaranteed anything since Brady uses everyone but he has the best chance.
Vs1FiM3daa	Personally, I'd play the Giant D over Dallas this week, but Dallas has the better long term prospect. I agree that having 2 Ds usually doesn't have much value - I usually have only one and either replace it when the bye week comes around or pick up a one week fill-in if I have a roster spot to play with and the normal starting D is particularly strong.<br>  <br>  If you really have to drop one this week, keep Dallas.|`|AA10204845	Wow, this is a tough one.  Dallas' D is definately better this season so far. They have saved me a couple of weeks this year.  But they have a terrible matchup against the redhot PATs.  On the otherhand, the Giants started with one of the worst D in the season, and they have gotten a lot better.  If you have no other option, I would drop Dallas, because of this matchup, but then pick them up ASAP afterwards because I don't trust the Giants defense to last the season.|`|KWWXZrJQaa	Giants are a great matchup against the Falcons this week.  Drop Dallas.  Both are 'bout the same for the season.|`|C1aFhbUMaa	I'd go with Dallas, they are the better team after all.  I should also remind you Dallas will have a bye week and you will need a D for that week when they are off.|`|nG7jH0PHaa	Id keep them both. you always need a backup for every postion. Its not good to start Dallas this week because there playing the Pats(scored 34+ PTS every game so far). Giants should be better playing the Falcons (lost LT for season, QB problems)
804485503b3845584b3530aab7d30cfaaa	I like Dawson as well, i think this will be a high scoring game, but Dawson has proven to be more reliable.|`|7sI4TtEIaa	Wilkins|`|3vSAc1XEaa	Both look like good starts . I like Wilkins in a high scoring game .|`|1k1Zq54waa	Definately  Dawson.  Wilkins has not been doing well at all and Dawson has picked it up a lot the past few weeks.  Wilkins will miss atleast 1 FG|`|69e8588d816302a0967a14a04b170649aa	Phil Dawson  They will have more TD and Scoring. With Wilkins I don't know he is a Ram player and they are not hot right now :(|`|m8OYRSNUaa	Start Wilkins STL has no offense he will kick at least 5 FG'S.
cb515fae1913fecd93588dea99aae1b1aa	I would say at RB go with White, because the oakland defense will have a hard time stopping him but that one is a tough call.  at QB i would play Anderson, he faces the 0-7 Rams who have been horrible on defense and coming off a bye week he will be well rested.|`|O4dkkqj2aa	Go with Rivers at QB.<br>  Go with White at RB.|`|5umjBpUsaa	go with gore and rivers and you will get a fair amount of points.|`|SkbtXPa6aa	Gore plays N.O. and he has been pissed off lately with his team's production.  Look for him to turn his anger into fantasy points against a weak RUN-D.  If Young is back in the line-up for TEN, don't expect for White to get the amount of carries he got last week.<br>  <br>  Go with Anderson at QB this week.  The Rams allow a ton of points and Anderson is on fire this season.  Speaking of being on the fire, all the Chargers players have been pre-occupied with it lately.  A distracted team will likely let LT take the work load and not mess the game up.<br>  <br>  Start Gore and Anderson.|`|VbAyq7Wfaa	Start LenDale White and Derek Anderson. They should both put up some very good fantasy stats this weekend.|`|VwyEvmqyaa	Gore and Anderson
AA10653241	It will definitely be the BYU Cougars, and they will play the California Bears in the Las Vegas Bowl.|`|c75fFPT6aa	The what conference.  Does it really matter.
ea83637a1b15e736daefcc0bcc33e89faa	no|`|zv4Uvoulaa	Canned Heat Lets Work together
m8OYRSNUaa	Start Garcia against the Jags.|`|1k1Zq54waa	Kitna, both of the Ds are about the same and Kitna is a better QB (Bears are not that good this year)|`|N4GbWNx8aa	You should start garcia <br>  <br>  this because is yet to throw an interception and the jags def. is only good against the rush <br>  <br>  jon kitna will probably have some problems against the bears defense since it has started to pick its self up again
4XRXKJndaa	I would go Evans! Why? JP is back in the lineup and he loves Evans PLUS they are playing the porous Bengals haha.|`|L6SLM1Xwaa	i have both players also<br>  i was thinkin curtis<br>  but i think evans is going to have a good game with JP back|`|Vpe6XbCLaa	Lee Evans is tempting with Losman starting agaist the Bengals but I would go with Curtis. Evans has had under 20 yards and no TD's in 4 of his games. Curtis is playing in a big time game against the Cowboys and gets alot of looks from McNabb. Good Luck|`|nzcCoCegaa	definitly curtis. he is a clutch receiver. was for the rams, is for the eagles. i have him on my fantasy team and he is one of my starters.|`|AA11089921	lee evans, kevin curtis is too inconsistant.

Jeff gives everything he has and takes chances and isnt afraid of the pain. Matt Hardy isnt as flashy when he does things but he is just as resilient. ppl like Jeff the same way ppl liked Edge better than Christian not nessacarily always a reason. Jeff is also always the underdog. PPl love a underdog.PPL dont like matt right now because he is a heel.|`|Gr7My8FTaa	idk y but i think that jeff sucks  matt hardy is a better wrestler|`|3I6YUfg0aa	I have always like Matt Hardy more then Jeff, especially when they used to do TLC matches against, The Dudleys/Edge+Christian/D-x (X-pac and Road Dogg)  Matt seemed to hold the team together, and without him, Jeff wouldn't be where he is today.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Because     The Like The Show    And Jeff Won The People Trowing himself From 30fts     And His Look The Look More Than Nothing     But I Always Like More Matt Hardy Since THe Mattitude|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	Jeff is the popular brother because of his high-flying abilities, his unique persona, and how he can relate to the fans way more than Matt.|`|NzqHYkMeaa	people prefer jeff because  hes better looking  he has amazing high flying ability|`|TWQNYhVVaa	because he does high-flying moves,Matt is the glue of the hardys,he ran OMEGA when they started while Jeff basically did nothing except wrestled,Matt gets cut because Edge had an affair with lita,jeff gets cut for drugs,and people still love him more then Matt..|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	Jeff is more of a risk taker, more of a daredevil, thats why people love him. when was the last time you saw Mat do a Whisper in the wind off of a cage or a 20 feet Swanton Bomb???|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Matt is a better wrestler than jeff overall and they seem equally liked and i didn't want matt to turn on jeff or think that we liked him less than jeff. Jeff is liked more from the fans because he does high flying maneuvers which entertains the fans. That's probably the reason why people like jeff more.|`|aosrstLpaa	Simple, he is more entertaining. Matt is boring as hell.|`|OfvR9AAgaa	people usuallly like jeff hardy better because he is a daredevil. meaning willing to risk anything. like jumping off 30 feet and landing on edge with a suicide jump. thats what the fans WANT to see. Matt on the other hand, he RARELY does anything on the top rope and over. he always does the same old classic moves that everyone can do. if u ask me, i think jeff is the person that makes the hardy boyz likable. UPDATE> in the royal rumble 2009, matt betrayed his brother (slamming a chair through his skull) costing jeff to loose the spinner belt to edge. people were saying y? Y? YY??? Matt hardy said that he wanted to make everyone like him but they had more intrest in jeff. he also said that he was tired of covering up for him in front of his parents adn he said there is no such thing as the Hardy Boyyz anymore. Matt also said that he will no longer conside Jeff as a partner nor as his brother.

czNUMFdWaa	Not at all.  I'm a High School Bowling Coach and I see it all the time.      The biggest problem with bowling is that anyone at anytime can get lucky and shoot 200.  It is unlike any other sport.  Some yahoo can't just go an pick up a golf club and shoot 72.  That same yahoo can't just pick up a bat and hit a 90mph fast ball over the fence. But...absolutely any yahoo can get lucky and shoot 200.    BUT...not just anyone can shoot 200 consistently.  It takes years of practice to become that talented.  Not just anyone can throw the ball 19mph with 300+ revs.  This takes natural athletic ability and years of practice.    You're on the right track here.  The people that do the teasing are ALWAYS non-bowlers.  They think its easy but the fact of the matter is...they have NO IDEA what they are talking or teasing about.    Unfortunately, you'll have to get used to it until Mainstream America decides to treat Bowling like other major sports.  The fact remains that Bowling draws more viewers than most NHL games, it is the largest participatory sport in the country, and it is the fastest growing High School sport in the country.    Good luck with the teasers and ask them if they want to bowl for 100.00 per game the next time the bug you.    Peace.|`|yRPYuJhsaa	Being a good bowler takes a lot of skill, something that most people don't have. So just throw your bowling ball at their head next time. Strike!|`|jiKbIJZBaa	Yes, it's just envy that you are a lot better than they are. Don't let it get to you, consider it a compliment.

I say LeBron James all the way!    LeBron is one of the more underrated defenders in the game. LeBron is one of the best help defenders in the NBA today. LeBron's ability and footwork on defense have been vastly underrated. LeBron is a 1st team defender getting low class recognition.    MVP should be an award that goes to the player who is most valuable in the NBA. There are many ways to determine an MVP and there have been various outcomes due to various ways of thinking. This year is simple, LeBron James is by far ahead of the rest of the MVP canidates. LeBron has a bunch of guys around him who are on the downside of their career. For the Cavs to be a contender in the east is nearly a miracle. You couldn't insert any 1 single other player from the NBA, in LeBron's position, and win as many games as the Cavs have. The bottom line is that LeBron rebounds like a power forward for his team. LeBron handles the ball like a point guard for his team. LeBron scores like a 2 guard for his team. LeBron is versatile like an athletic 3 for his team. LeBron handles the ball a lot, and he has a low turnover count. To handle the ball as much as LeBron does and have the same amount of turnovers as Kobe Bryant, who handles the ball less, it's another piece of proof that he is far above these other MVP canidates. LeBron has more steals and blocks as well. These stat totals don't appear magicly. LeBron has put up great production this year by playing his *** off. LeBron has singlehandedly led his team to more wins than any other player in the NBA. I also contend that LeBron is now the most unstoppable player in the NBA. You cannot deny that LeBron James is the single most valuable player in the NBA. I would contend that well over 60% of the GM's in the NBA would take LeBron James  1 if they could draft him today. He's young, athletic, skilled, smart, and he plays his *** off. LBJ is the true MVP. Kobe is a better pure shooter, and if you agree with that, then you have no choice but to agree with the fact that LeBron is better at attacking the rim, rebounding, passing, handling the ball, lifting his team to wins single handedly, and he is putting up better defensive production. For every 1 category that Kobe beats LeBron in, LeBron beats Kobe in 3 more. Kobe shoots a better % from 3 pointers yet LeBron has the better fg%. So what's that tell you? Logicly it tells a realistic fan that Kobe is missing more shots INSIDE of the 3 point line. Considering the fact that the highest % of shots taken are inside the three point line, it's safe to say the more valuable player is the man who can make the higher % of shots from the floor as a whole. Shooting a high% with free throws is a necessity to Kobe's game. A big part of Kobe's game is drawing touch shooters fouls on the perimeter. LeBron does not need to rely on drawing fouls. The nights where Kobe doesn't get the calls he is more at risk to be a detriment to his team.
AyoxEkRTaa	leave it alone|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Just let it be.  Cutting the skin off will expose tender skin and increase the chance of getting blisters or worse.  It'll fall off on it's own.

Hell, give me directions to that store!<br>  Take it to the cleaners.|`|Wq3MAAN4aa	Have a dry cleaner steam press it. They use a buck press (<a href="http://www.fethil.net/tr/textile/textile03f.htm)," rel="nofollow">http://www.fethil.net/tr/textile/textile...</a> which is a professional shaping and pressing system that applies bit of dry steam, which warms the fabric a bit, then drops the pressing head buck to press the garment lightly (which unlike a hand iron, doesn't push things around), while it turns on vacuum from underneath, through holes in the lower buck, which cools the fabric instantly and sets the press.<br>  <br>  You'll get back a jersey ready to frame, if you don't plan to wear it.|`|2f4fa755f256c1a396163ab899bc948caa	Bring it to a Dry-cleaner, and have them Starch it!<br>  That's what I do, it cost like $5 buck's.|`|kHuyMTYKaa	If it is in Good shape throw it in a WARM dryer for about 5 minutes....I have never had a jersey hurt by the dryer.

He has improved a lot and you can see he has worked hard to improve things like his defense and his jumpshot|`|oQUq25hVaa	I'd think Lebron James. Kobe is falling behind in his game, Shaq isn't getting any better and is losing his agility but not his dunk, and Wade is just not old enough yet. Wade's team also isn't that good and he will definitely get better when he gets older! :)|`|N8AJnAbuaa	Wade|`|vVe1lLVpaa	Lebron...    He's teammates has less talent than that of Kobe  but still he manages to carry his team to the finals.

7f2GSDmqaa	You're a good user and you post good questions, but posting questions like this, like The Botton Line said, is pointless. It only adds fuel to the fire. I understand many users, especially today, are not at all happy with the wrestling section, but you have to understand that there will always be trolls and questions and answers you dont like. You just have to ignore them and ask good questions like you usually do. Im just being honest with you. There is no way to decrease the bad questions asked, as anybody can log on and ask what they want with the power of the keyboard. Just ignore it.    Edit: No problem|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	thank you finaly ppl have been seening it when you come across a question like that dont anser report and dont look back bc the ws used to be full of  good questions better ansers and yeah mag and to live and die for wwe are some of the best on yahoo ansers and like many others are tired of the crappy ansers and stupid questions so as far as im conserned the 10 year olds who think its funny bc they said boob or talked about sex its only a matter of time before they get older and relize how annoying those questions are so im just gonna keep reporting and ill hope youll do the same|`|UzHt495Saa	Oh My idk if u were already here when most of the questions in WS are ''HOW CAN A 16 YR.OLD MAKE SOME MONEY ONLINE'' and ''THE SWAG BUCKS QUESTIONS'' and those questions ''WHY ARE U WATCHING WRESTLING?'' i mean come on! what Gay and Pointless questions..lol|`|XRw2ux9waa	Only when WWE gets serious about their woman's division again will majority of those questions stop. No point in them asking who's hotter when they wouldn't find any of them hot in the first place!    So no. There's nothing WE can do, except ask more intellectual questions to drown out the dumb ones.|`|q4v9lO6Laa	I agree, these questions are pointless that you mentioned. Sadly though, i don't think we can decrease this unless we all want to report who ever is asking these questions until they get kicked off.

cR7Sf4cjaa	Way too many questions!    1 - screw tap charts are for 75% thread contact.  You drill under that for 100% contact which is much stronger, but, requires more precision screws to prevent binding.    2. To get the shine you use a commercial grade heat gun on the surface to be painted before appling the laquer.  This flashes off the volitales and prevents the remaining surface from running.    3.  Glass bead blasting.    4.  No.  Drill presses are not made to tolerances required for grinding.  You can use the press to remove 80% of the material, then the grinder to finish the job........ maybe.    5. You either ream the rifling away to the estimated crown depth, or, use a pilot bushing of the caliber size inside the barrel to guide.  Sold at Brownels.com    6.  Not my area of expertise    7.  First, find two soft or medium grade nuts the same thread as the bushing.  Carefully grind both down to .20" - install these little guys on the bushing and snug them together.  Add a drop of Croil (coal oil) to the stuck screws threads and twist them apart.    Hope this helps|`|5LuWiXj7aa	6 You can make an insert for round action wrenches. Simply find the correct dia. material or turn on lathe, cut in half and fit.    Or you can make your own action wrench depending on machining exp. and availability.    7 Also you can try heating the bushings with a propane torch. This loosens any bonding agents. Clamp in padded vise jaws and remove screw.
LUnscegvaa	Yes an interesting idea.  Try it and see ,you may even gain more ideas through implementing it.    Good luck and Best wishes :)***|`|NSNfPmEqaa	yes........

YCUJMvWQaa	i think the best is melina cause she can get crazy and shes very good and has awesome moves:)    I think maria is the worst syes alwas losing lol she should just stick to what syes good at wich is playboy lol     I dont watch play boy im just sayin cause it said it on wwe lol    U a wwe fan? Add me :)|`|BglekVnQaa	Best- Beth Phoenix, Melina, and Mickie James  Worst-Maria, Kelly Kelly, Michelle McCool, and Candice Michelle    Something must be wrong with you if you think Maria's the best Diva and Mickie James the worst. Oh wait something is wrong with you cause you're future wwe diva svr 2009.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	Currently:  Best - Natalya. She can actually wrestle. Natalya, Beth, Melina, Maryse, Katie Lea and Mickie James are the only divas that can actually kick @ss.    Worst - Kelly Kelly. She screams and whines when shes in a match and she always does the same moves. I'm just really tired of her. She can't wrestle even if her life was on the line.    (:|`|WpaQKpckaa	BEST: Maryse- she's really talented   WORST: Jillian Hall- She's so .. yuck. And i'm not even referring to her singing.|`|q4v9lO6Laa	Best-   Raw-  Melina she is a multiple time women's champion and has been in the business for almost 4 years. She is very small compared to the rest of the divas but she has muscle and a ton of athleticism  SmackDown- Natalya because shes a great Technical wrestler and is very very strong, then Maryse because she is an outstandingwrestler for someone who hasn't been training for long    Worst-   RAW- I would say kelly kelly but then you think about it and the answer is layla, she does absoulutly nothing! and when she wrestles all she does is point her finger in peoples faces  Smackdown- Maria, she is dreadful, how is she the best in your opinion?!?! She is way too skinny and is still mentioning playboy, come on that was last year. And she absoulutly cant wrestle for her life.|`|G7GhFGdRaa	Worst is candice michelle because she sucks in the ring.  Best is Beth Pheonix because she right now is the best female wrestler on TV.  Best all time is Trish Stratus, she could wrestle and she was hot.|`|mvTc3GxNaa	best at wrestling right now = mickie james. she half way knows what shes doing.    worst = the rest of the divas, they don't know how to wrestle.|`|pZJPz6CGaa	Best- Natalya Neidhart and Beth Phoenix  Worst- Maria and Kelly Kelly the Playboy sluts|`|OfvR9AAgaa	i think the best is melina and beth  the worst is probrably kelly kelly    ps maria isnt the worst. i guess you could say that she WAS but she has beeb improving.|`|Tsv6zyawaa	Best - Beth phoenix the old divas  worst - kelly keylly and maria, face it they really have no point in wwe they are ruining the name for female wrestlers they are eye candy|`|G9LSZQcaaa	Best-Beth Phoenix  Worst-Maria
D6Llh23Baa	i think they'd be pretty darn pissed if you took on the leadership role without them consenting to it. what you have to do for now is to know each other better. understand each others' plays on the court, as well as tendencies. to be a good leader, trust is a key value. you should be able to trust them, and them you. if you prove to them you can take the leadership mantle, then they'd accept it, i guess.|`|1gPJO37qaa	Yeh it matters if your a freshman you would get no respect.

AA12339493	well it's probably not as easy as everyone thinks. you have to see what your team needs to be honest. carmelo just scores and shoots. he's very good at it, but he doesnt pass, doesnt rebound as well as a guy with his ability should, doesnt block shots, and doesnt play much D. jamison on the other hand can score 20, grab 10 boards, block a couple shots, and play some D. when playing fantasy basketball id rather have jamison for his all around game, because pts are easy to get in fantasy. jamison shoots a better %, grabs more boards, turns the ball over much less, gets more steals, blocks more, and scores 21 ppg.|`|uxregJ0faa	Anthony|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Carmelo Antony|`|GBGcI509aa	Kobe.|`|5b3bc75908f8e6f307db37d7e1944faaaa	carmelo anthony on the court    now off is a lil diff|`|CHdQqxM4aa	Carmelo    Who do u think u r shittin'|`|gaNDR31Taa	Carmelo         2008-09 Statistics Carmelo:  PPG  21.1  RPG  7.1  APG  3.6  SPG  0.9  BPG  0.3  FG%  0.436  FT%  0.771  3P%  0.415  MPG  33.8    2008-09 Statistics Antawn:   PPG  21.1  RPG  9.1  APG  1.9  SPG  1.3  BPG  0.4  FG%  0.470  FT%  0.743  3P%  0.327  MPG  38.4    note that the season is not over and this is only the current season stats.

dB85SoMyaa	There are plenty of martial arts / fighting systems etc. If you want a personal trainer like Jennifer Lopez had in the movie, be prepared to pay. You may want to look to traditional jujitsu (not sport jujitsu), krav maga, fight, scars, spears, etc. There is nothing wrong with traditional okinawan karate etc, don't rule that out.     There are instructors that will personally train you if that is what you are looking for, however it is better to join a class so you have many different types of people to work with. It will also be cheaper in the long run than personal training.    Ask the instructors you talk to what kind of mental preparation are they going to teach you. Anyone can learn techniques and not be able to put them into practice because they do not have the survival, killer mind set. Not paranoia.    The physical approach is not always the best answer. In Karate Kid the greatest line I remember was "best block, no be there", Best situation is no be there. Use your head, figure it out ahead of time and avoid the situation if at all possible. Otherwise you better have the right mentality to fight without rules to save your life if it comes down to it.     There are plenty of people who know zero martial arts knowlege or skills that save their lives in dire situations because of their mental awareness, and mental attitude for survival no matter what.     Always be aware of your surroundings, learn and know the various scenarious the you can get in trouble with, do not put yourself in those scenarios, have a plan, make the plan dynamic so it can change with the situation, and develop the survival mentality.     You are in charge of your life. Don't let some stranger dictate to you when you are going to be safe of not.     They have no right.     You are worth defending!|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	Check yellow pages or online search for a local Muay Thai gym, Muay Thai or Thai Boxing is the best weapon for self defence and in Thai boxing the smaller the body the better you could be. The world not that bad yet but its good to be able to look after yourself|`|GWqyM4eAaa	I can understand your desire for a feeling of security and I think knowing how to hit (especially in vital areas) would be most useful. As a female you need to play to your strengths and take full advantage of them which you already understand. Personal protection devices such as mace and high pitch alarms are a good back-up that shouldn't be overlooked either. Even the best fighters are never as good as the ones we see in the movies, so don't put all of your confidence in knowing how to defend yourself. You can find plenty of self defence classes around the place and I'm pretty sure they would be your best bet. You'd want one that is truly practical for self defence purposes so you should be wary of ones that don't place enough emphasis on practical engagement in role-play situations that are practiced until you have a good level real time proficiency. Some of them are highly focused on the fitness element and this can also be good if it doesn't have too much of an emphasis.|`|AA12171405	go look for certified instructors in any dojo/dojang or martial art studio. interview those instructors as well. see whether there are many high martial art achievers or not who have been training under them. if there are not many high achievers among them, perhaps their instructor is bad.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	....    So you're looking for particularly feminist martial art instructor?    @ - Eugene - I am at a loss for words. I really am. You have managed to provide almost every single misconception about self defense. It's impressive in a way.|`|NSNfPmEqaa	yea|`|xDINUPBuaa	You can have the best fighting instructor there is.  But if you're not willing to do the real damage, there's no point.  All you really need to know to get out of a situation, is not to panic, go for the eyes, groin, kidney, nose, throat, and use anything around you as a weapon.  If your not willing to poke someone's eye out, or if you are just prone to panic, an instructor will do you no help.      Instructor's are really there for motivation and some proper use of self defense.  You can learn all you need to know from videos or maybe even youtube.  You just need to practice a bit.  Get a practice dummy like you see at a sporting goods store.  Or even a punching bag.  You'll need to know how to really deliver a strike.  After a few months of practice, you'll be ready to take someone down.      Also carry some mace, just in case.

9a5jTJPFaa	Boston didn't overpay Posey and the hornets did. Not saying Posey is a bad player he good but they need another starting scoring threat. David West isn't having an all-star year even though he's on the team. One last thing is the D is still lacking. No true shot blocker in the middle or steady defender in the middle. They might get the 3 spot in the western conf. if they can fix those things.|`|dDhTMacAaa	The Hornets are a pick of mine to go deep after they showed a tough, unstoppable mentality for so long last season.    This season, their defense is lacking and they are struggling to stay consistent on offense.    Chris Paul can't do it by himself.    I am certain things will pick up AT LEAST by March and they will be a usual threat in the post-season.|`|BfwzbKSoaa	And that is why CP3 is not yet consistent of having a MVP award|`|vJyF8siJaa	NO lost Pargo, Posey is overpaid, West is inconsistent and Tyson is injured.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	Now you know how Pistons fans feel....|`|AA10248312	They're not a smart team...     They thought they'd just walk on the court this year and pick up where they left off last year...it doesn't work that way.  Every year you have to start from scratch and bust your tail from day one.      They obviously watched themselves on Sportscenter too much last year and got all full of themselves.|`|dzJR8Dwvaa	because they left charlotte =D|`|PSMsDalLaa	Injuries and letting Pargo go really hurt the second unit.    Also for some reason they refuse to play Julian Wright. I know they got Posey but Wright was very good for them.    Tyson Chandler needs to stay on the court too, that would help. Hilton Armstrong is a pile of crap.|`|AA12339493	what do you mean constantly? they've only lost like 5 games to sub 500 teams. well to be like boston or la, they have to make lopsided trades. those 2 teams are stacked. unless they can do what the lakers did and trade someone like rasual butler for chris bosh or something, dont expect them to be like the lakers yet.
ZKikquiOaa	Do you have a kill line?  There's a guy I usually fly with at the beach, I fly a small quad stunter, he flies a traction kite, roughly 3m wide.  When the wind get up to the 20-25 mph range he usually pack it up and go home.  He's pretty big, 6'3" maybe 220 lbs.  A kill line is a good thing to have, attach it to the trailing edge of your kite, if it gets too much, pull on the line and it will stall the kite.|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	Baden Powell, not the boy scout one but his brother was a pioneer of military aviation, he experimented with kites to lift different weights back in 1895 while his older brother was trying to keep the Boers out of Maffeking.    He made one 120 square feet that would lift a man.    A 3m power kite according to my link can lift a 16 stone man, that's 224 pounds, take care!
4owr19vCaa	The JG Bar 10 Dimitri linked to is a good choice    for 400+ fps at that price range, as mentioned, are going to be few and far between - the only recommendations I can give are these at the under $110 mark, part of the JG "2009 pre-upgraded" deals    JG G608 - G36C, 406 FPS  http://www.weaponblender.com/index.php?p...  $104    JG AK-47 tactical RIS - 419 FPS  http://www.weaponblender.com/index.php?p...  $109      They do have reasonable shipping around $5.  These are purported to have an M120 w/ reinforced gearbox & metal bushings as part of the upgrade but that is unconfirmed.  If that is the case they are stepping up their game as Cyma has in the past couple of years.  Competition is a good thing :)      cheers|`|U0Rvsabdaa	You can't get 400 fps for that little.     Really you can't get any really nice guns for that much.|`|Y4mz8BShaa	There's only a few AEG's in that price range (the rest are LPEG junk, aside from the JG's, which are lower quality than the CYMA's), and one bolt action. I'm going to assume you mean "assault rifle" instead of "machine gun." If you're after a SAW, there's none in that range, and if you meant an actual machine gun...just, no.    Don't expect 400+ FPS for under $100. You can get it from the CM028/S, but anything else will die running that.    http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...

Wouldn't recommend using.    http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...   Only bolt action in your range worth buying.|`|ZytMT3sLaa	you could get a UTG M50. It is $44.99. It can shoot 325 fps. The mag capacity is 14 rounds. I think it is a good gun.|`|CSvpuq1Naa	Look at airsoftatlanta.com its got some really good guns. I f you are willing to go out of your budget i would recommend the echo one M16. I have VN version. If you want a sniper rifle you won't be able to get a good one in that range. At airsplat.com there is a MOD5 for 80$ it looks like a nice gun, but I'm not sure.    http://airsoftatlanta.com/aeg.htm ECHO1  Ithink the mini gun is a little out of your range lol.    http://air softatlanta.com/rifle.htm  Look at the first two.    http://airsplat.com/Items/ER-BEL-EG713-3...  http://www.airsplat.com/Items/ER-WELL-MP...  http://www.airsplat.com/Items/ER-WELL-R1...  http://www.airsplat.com/Items/ER-WELL-R1...  http://www.airsplat.com/Items/ER-XL-AK47...  http://www.airsplat.com/Items/ERM-AGM-M1...      There is one airsoft gun that you can get with 400 fps. It is a gas pistol. I know from experience it is an amazing gun. It can be found at walmart. I know it surprised me too.  http://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng....
hGUUeXLhaa	Steelers.  I think this because Tory Polamalu is the star player and can bring the Cardinals down!

That means doing running tempos, core work, strength training, arm work, etc. Go online find find "track and field" related workouts.

	95 grain is the standard for FMJ ammo, while 94 grain is the standard JHP weight.  There are very few deviations from this.    One deviation is Brown Bear LVE which uses a 115 grain JHP|`|hcc8fq7jaa	I believe it's 95 gr. That's basically a short 9mm round. Be careful buying a Makarov, a lot of them are real low quality junk, and unreliable.|`|AA11729094	The heaviest bullet I've seen for mak's is a 95 grain, that's commercial ammo.

KdhNCnEjaa	Since Wilson Chandler is by far the most talented player in that game, Ill take him for MVP.     And your right about the David Lee in the dunk contest, when he took his shirt off and dunked it against White that was nuts.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	I'm guessing you're a Knicks fan?    Anyway, he has a chance. Wilson is very inconsistent, and maybe this will be one of his good games.    I think Robinson should be in the contest over David Lee, but he shouldn't get higher scores because he's short.|`|DVxVVvIoaa	Westbrook isnt in!|`|EKF2HdZKaa	yes,actually everyone in the winning team has a good chance to win it  david lee won it,gibson got it last year  plus the rookie sophomore game is just for kicks,players dont care about the awards or anything|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	David Lee this Wilson Chandler that....man I'm a Laker fan and I dont even brag about my players as much as you do.

And D-Lee would be nice to have in there, but not over NastyNate. I know he had a million attempts last time. But that was last time. If anything he will be motivated to NOT do that again.

WTH.|`|FPxXiabNaa	You played well today and you will look great when Ronaldo starts playing like he did a year ago. At the moment he's nowhere near the best player in the world.

Did you know that as a player of the Toronto Raptors, he dunk the ball from the Free Throw line in a game?    Atlanta:    Nothing too complicated... Really like Josh Smith, Bibby... Johnsons a favorite.    Nuggets:    Chauncey    Cavaliers:    Used to be my favorite, right before pistons for about 1/2 a year.  Stay a little loyal to them.    Trailblazers:    Ever since Roy, Fernandez, Oden, Blake, and Darius Miles got there, I was a fan.

0Dm3WEMcaa	The suicide dive or any version of is much harder for a big man to do. With old school you at least have someone holding onto you if you have a miss step which can help you stay up there but the dive is getting your body high enough to clear the ropes and far enough to hit your opponent. Keeping your balance is much easier than launching yourself that high and far IMO.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I would say Old School. You need tremendous balance to pull that move off, of course, you get some help from your opponent because he holds you up there, but I'd imagine its still hard to do, which is why noone but the Undertaker really does it.|`|H3nbC71eaa	Both are extremely difficult for a big man to do..but I would have to say Old School. Being able to keep your balance on the top rope is difficult for just about anybody..let alone a big man. But don't get me wrong, the Suicide Dive is difficult to do also..I love it everytime Hernandez does it also..who's a pretty big guy. For a big guy to be able to clear that top rope is a tremendous feat..but I believe Undertaker will be the only one, or the one of very very few big guys that can walk the top rope.|`|WK6vrkdKaa	I think that it depends on the balance and agility a big man has..Hernandez, Matt Morgen, The Undertaker, and Kane(sometimes) can fly over the ropes like its nothing or walk the top rope(Matt) so it depends on the balance and agility they have..|`|6LQNK51uaa	If u can balance ur weight over rope than Old School is not harder(since u can balance ur self with help of opponents hannds) but a suicide dive for a super heavyweight is hard one..|`|Cr3EjgSEaa	BREAKING: Vince McMahon is *BACK* Monday night..

Suicide Dive take Incredible Hops to clear a Rope That is 5 feet above the Mat.  WITHOUT using the ropes for leverage.  A clean 5 foot leap is rather Difficult.    Even Jeff , Bourne , AJ , etc... don't do that without using the ropes for leverage.

Kobe Bryant kept the team in place and he was what got them into the NBA playoffs.

cRqwANvlaa	It all depends. If the match was hardcore rules, then RVD would win because he has that radical offense with all his chair kick variations.    But if it were standard rules, Great Muta. He is just a better scientific wrestler than RVD is and I tihnk he could outlast RVD.

LVrH8W57aa	Sara Del Rey vs. Leliani Kei = Leliani Kei !  she is 1 of the best ever, and 1 of the most underrated everr, she's as quick as a cat , but she's also big too, she is a better technical wrestler then Del Rey, she has been wrestling for almost 35 years, Leilanie is an underrated legend, and in the top 5 the best wwe ever had.    MsChif vs. Wendi Richter = Ah, what a match 2 great wrestlers, this would really be a good match.  wendi's finishers were the reverse death valley driver and sitout DDT , and those finishers looked great in the 80's and would also be amazing in this era, wendi revolugnized women wrestling no one thoug moolah could be beaten.. and Mschif, oh she is great at every aspect of wrestling.  winner :  draw, however i see Mschif surpassing Wendi at the end of her carreer, but for now, it's  draw    Cheerleader Melissa vs. Sensational Sherri= Melissa!!!!!!!  Sherri was a very good wrestler but i think Melissa has her beat every aspect of wrestling, Melissa is just so amazing, Melissa has been called the best in the world many times, and i could make a case of why she is indeed the best, she is great from every aspect of wrestling.. just like mschif, now Sherri was defenetly more charismatic and way better on the mic than melissa, but in a Wrestling Match, the future legend beats the legend    Nikki Roxx vs. Alundra Blayze= MADUSA wins. as good as Nikki is, Madusa is in a different league, she might be in a league of her own, she could hang with the best from Aja Kong to Bull Nakano to Akira Hokuto, she knew how to work it with everyone, Madusa is a legend, and she is probably the best american female wrestler of the last 20 years, Nikki is good and has brawling advantage, but Madusa would school her here.    winner, old school women 2-1-1|`|JiCfYfLraa	the wwe womans legends would win i mean you got alundra blayze and wendi richter they are like the best in wrestling.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	3.

That's like saying that Ben has more to play for than Kurt because Kurt has been there 2 times...what a load !

Sure they played terrible towards the end of the regular season, but the fact is that their offense is better than that of the Steelers.  Also you cannot deny that Kurt Warner has played great all year long.  I don't like either team, but I will say that the Steelers stand a great chance of losing.  Also the Cardinals have more to play for.  If they win, its their first championship ever.  The Steelers already have 5, they can get another one anytime since their organization is so great.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	I do! I'm a Cowboys fan!|`|ZlaxbI33aa	I hate the squealers.

Right now they want us to let them pass the money issue and their liberal agenda. But once they get what they want they will come down on gun owners like storm troopers!  The idea of the gun industry misleading the public is humorous when we have so many elected and appointed anti-gun people in our government who are out to take our gun rights away.|`|dpSr0icwaa	absolutely not.    If the gun industry could make up unfounded fear to drive sales they would do it with each and every president, and then Obama Effect sales would be the same as any other president's effect.    What is driving the fear is    1OBAMA'S VOTING RECORD   2 OBAMA'S PERSONAL STATEMENTS about 4 years ago or earlier, before he really ever thought about running for president.|`|HUQMqdDqaa	I think that Obama's own actions and words are what is driving the prices as the availability of ammo and firearms can not keep up with the demand of "new" buyers. Obama has said that he wants to make the 1994 AWB perm. and has also said that he is going to enact "common sense" approach to gun control. Well what exactly does that mean? Is it common sense for me to use my AK as a hunting rifle? Is it common sense to purchase more than one firearm a month? His ambiguity is what is causing fear as no one knows what exactly he is planning on banning.|`|JsjRSZjYaa	Well unless you research this and just listen to the mass media its not as clear. But consider this; the number of his administration thats anti gun, his vice president, secretary of state, attorney general and the list goes on in fact his administration is over 80% anti gun.   Obamas disdain for the Constitutional right to keep and bear arms is clear - though he later denied it, in 1996 during his run for the Illinois State Senate, Obama told non-profit organization Independent Voters of Illinois that he supported a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns, a de facto national annulment of the second amendment.  Obamas first appointment since winning the election, soon to be chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, also has an established record in pushing for gun control.  Emanuel cosponsored H.R. 1312 (Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2005).  He also voted NO on prohibiting product misuse lawsuits on gun manufacturers (Oct 2005), voted NO on prohibiting suing gunmakers & sellers for gun misuse (Apr 2003), has supported so-called smart gun technology, which restricts usage of firearms and has been given an F by the NRA, indicating a pro-gun control voting record.  Eric Holder/Attorney general   Eric Holder signed an amicus brief in the Heller case that supported the District of Columbias handgun ban, and also argued that the Second Amendment does not protect an individual right, noted SAF founder Alan Gottlieb. He has supported national handgun licensing and mandatory trigger locks. As deputy attorney general under Janet Reno, he lobbied Congress to pass legislation that would have curtailed legitimate gun shows.

If some one cant see whats coming they are naive.|`|yQ4M5UYOaa	I think the gun industry, like any profit-oriented industry, is seizing an opportunity to increase sales, especially considering that we're in a recession right now and consumer confidence is low. You can't blame the gun industry for wanting to make a dollar and the threat of a so-called permanent ban on guns is a good motivator.    However, I think it's a two-prong ordeal. I think the gun rights crowd is just as panicky and prone to hysteria about losing their guns as the Brady campaign is about "big AK47 assault rifles". I know the NRA and other far-right groups went into a frenzy over a dead-end bill  that would have required bullets to be micro-stamped for easy traceability. The NRA uses anything it can to scare its members into believing that guns will be banned unless their members start writing checks. According to the fliers the NRA sends out, it's never a good day for gun owners. We're always on the brink of losing our second amendment rights.    I think because both sides are blinded by an emotional fear, one side afraid of losing their guns, the other side afraid of guns themselves, it makes it hard to get a rational look at things.     I know that Obama, Rahm Emanuel and Hillary Clinton are for gun control, but I also know that a lot of Democratic members of the Congress and Senate are pro gun-rights, and I don't think an assault weapons ban would go over well with the general population. Look at what's been going on recently with handgun bans being lifted all over the place.    Nonetheless, I recently spent way too much on an SKS.|`|D9Nv0uiDaa	Ron M ya need to read some of sourdoughs links buddy.      Here is Obama own words in an interview with Field & Stream;  Question;  LICATA: You mentioned common-sense gun legislation. Would you consider  the assault weapons ban and registration of guns to fall into that category of common-sense gun control?    Obama; I think that when  it comes to the assault weapons ban, the answer is yes. I think AK-47s  generally are not used for hunting. AK-47s or vest-piercing bullets are generally used to hurt people. And I think that it's legitimate for us to say military-style weapons that aren't traditionally used for  purposes other than killing people, we've got to be careful about.     And here is how he tries to reassure us;  But I'll be honest with you. I'm more interested in enforcing the laws  that we do have-for example, tracing guns that are used in crimes back  to people who have been using them. I don't anticipate that there's  going to be a whole slew of efforts at the federal level when it comes to gun control. But I think that strong background checks; making sure  that we're dealing with the gun-show loophole, which I think has been a  problem; allowing us to trace guns that are used in crimes back to where  they were purchased--those are the kinds of initiatives that I think pose no threat whatsoever to law-abiding gun owners.    Did you catch the lie???  I don't anticipate that there's going to be a whole slew of efforts at the federal level when it comes to gun control. Then why does he appoint an anti gun cabinet and attorney general? And why is some of the stimulus bill going to antigun groups?    http://www.fieldandstream.com/articles/h...    So to answer yer question I say the reverse is true; the media and anti-gun lobby are using the spin to divert attention from their efforts by sayin the gun industry is spreading propaganda.|`|X1H8hDtjaa	I think it is great that the one business that is profiting and making jobs in this economic climate is the very industry that our government is against. I mean doesn't it make sense to ruin the one business that is flourishing. Guess that is Politics. They might as well destroy all American industries while their at it.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	The saying "Just because you are paranoid does'nt mean they're not after you." comes to mind.  Yes gun companies are making a fortune now but there is a good chance that a lot of stuff will be banned and Americans will be jealous of all the cool toys Canadians can buy.|`|AA11694178	No!!  If you listen and read what Obama is saying, has said and will say in the future, as well as those in his cabinet, you will realize that the fear is real.  Don't take my word or someone else's word, do your own research so you can be sure of what is gong on in Washington as far as guns and your rights go.|`|nooi0ldjaa	did the gun industry vote for obama every time he voted anti-gun?    the gun industry didn't set obamas record. he did.

Van Der Sar is a great keeper but a lot of credit must also go to Vidic who is probably the best centre back in the world at the moment.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Yes, ManU fans shouldn't get too ahead of themselves lol
4kdlE54Paa	TO will only go to a team that has a solid passing game.  Jacksonville's passing game is average and Chicago's passing game is mediocre.  Those two offenses are conservative and rely mostly on the running game and controlling the clock.  TO would cry louder than he ever has in an offense like that.  Those 2 teams will avoid the drama to keep the team focussed.  They are not the type of teams to take risks like that.    The only other team that I think would take such a risk would be the Raiders because of owner mentality of Al Davis.  If that happens, expect a reality show starring TO and Al Davis.  That show will compete very well against American Idol. LOL!    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	They said on NFL Network that he would fit in Oakland.|`|PSMsDalLaa	No where.

ePvvGUu3aa	I watched your promo over and over evaluating it. For starters, it was a good promo overall, but the fact that it's a heel promo, it was lacking the amount of the "heel hook". It's something that would hook the crowd at least. When you said your a good wrestler and your going to prove that, instead of using "good" you should use the word "best". Can I ask you something, when you said entertainment three times in a row, you struggled a bit, didn't you?     What you could improve on is somewhat staying on point and not switch back and forth. When I was watching it, I didn't think you were a heel really. I do love that you have a voice and can talk, you talk with a bit of passion too.     What defines a good promo? Good is not the best, but I'll go by good standards. Being able to hook the crowd towards you (getting their attention). Swinging the crowds emotion at your control. Matter fact, I think I have a question about mic skills that will help probably. I'll post the question if I can. Keep up the good work though.    Edit: Here's the link to my old question about mic skills. Mic skills are connected to Promos, so here it is.

Once you're in the position, you stick the right analog stick up to bring their heads up, then stick it down to bash their heads. But be careful if you do it too many times, you're character will automatically stop and get tired.

yxaOg0QDaa	definitely, thats probably the biggest problem facing the NFL right now and if they dont do something soon they are going to lose popularity    you play 4 full quarters of brutal hits, big plays, offensive strategies, defensive strategies, you both play your hearts out and end up tying with each other..now you go into overtime and your fate is determined purely on chance, all those 4 quarters you played with your talent will be diminished with the flip of a coin    dont say "oh if your defense is good enough you can make the stop", no..suppose your defense was out on the field right before overtime, they made the stops they had to make to force an overtime game, but that same team loses the coin flip, so now that same tired defense who just made 4 stops has to go and make another 4? how fair is that? they should be rewarded for making the stops, not punished by a coin flip    it should NOT be sudden death overtime, ESPECIALLY when its important games with playoff implications, thats just as bad as a ref making a bad call that ruins the whole game    both teams should get a chance to score, and none of this coin flip bullshit, if the defense made the stops in the 4th to force an overtime, then that team's offense should get the ball first, you play a 7 minute quarter so that time outs actually mean something, if neither team can score in those 7 minutes, THEN you go into a sudden death overtime, which would also be 7 minutes|`|ecwhBLnxaa	No|`|PSMsDalLaa	No.    If anything maybe eliminate ties altogether and play unlimited OT's.    If you really want to win, do it in regulation. otherwise a coin flip is the only thing you can do.    And if your worried about losing the coinflip, play a little defense and stop the other team.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I heard that they have been trying to change this to over time rules like that of the NBA where you have a double OT if a team does not score in regulation.  I think its a bad idea to change it.  The whole point of it being sudden death is whoever scores wins the game.  First off, it would make the game too long to sit through.  I love football, however sitting through two overtime games wouldn't make me love it more.  It would be way too long.  Secondly, you have to think of the players.  The longer they are on the field the more at risk they are for injury.  I say keep it the way it is and don't change it thing.  We already have enough disappointment with stopping the TD celebrations, we don't need anymore changes.    Edit: And the whole coin flip thing, I think it is fine the way it is.  Its based on chance.  Some say whoever wins the coin flip toss wins the game.  Actually that theory isn't always correct.  What is relevant is if the opposing defense who didn't win the coin flip can stop the offense.  It all matters about what you do, not so much the coin flip.  If your defense doesn't do its job then that is to blame for the loss, or if the offense does its job that is who wins.  Coin flips are just used to decide who goes first just like in the beginning of the game.|`|mggll8dRaa	If it can come up with something better....!!|`|af2bcd9347369776f2a7c09928275944aa	Hell no, in my opinion, "If it ain't broke, then don't fix it."|`|eflQHBK2aa	I believe that they should because with the high powered offenses these days, winning in overtime sometimes comes down to the coin flip. It should be like college football where each team gets a possession no matter what.|`|ZlaxbI33aa	I say no. If your defense can't hold the other team then you don't deserve to win.

n2O0NwR6aa	Sure you could!  My daughter's high school has a competitive team, in addition to their regular cheer squads.  Here's how it works:    The competition team is made up of school cheerleaders, but it's optional.  Anyone from the Freshman, JV or Varsity squads can try out for it.  Tryouts for the competiton team happen in the summer, after cheer camp.  It's basically just a week or two of open workouts - whoever wants to be on the team comes in and works on tumbling, jumps, and stunting, and the coaches put together a team based on what they see and what they think will work best.    The competition team members still go to all their regular school practices and games, but they have additional practices twice a week to prepare for competition.  They go to 3 or 4 compeitions throughout the fall, ending with NCA High School Nationals in December.  (Our team won this year! Yay!)    If you want to start something like that at your school, here are some steps to take:    First, find out how many of the cheerleaders would be interested - you'll need enough people to make a team!  Next, ask the cheer coaches if they'd be willing to do it.  It would obviously mean extra work for them; if they aren't willing to do it, you could look for someone else who would.  Depending on your school's rules, it may have to be a school employee. Perhaps there's a teacher who used to cheer, and might be interested?      One question that everyone will ask is: how much will it cost, and how will we raise the money?  So it will help if you can do some research ahead of time and be ready to answer those questions.  Find out which competitions are held in your area, and what the entry fees are.  Your sister's cheer coach can probably help you with that.  Another cost is uniforms; if the team is made up of girls from different squads, they won't all have matching uniforms - so you'll probably have to buy some for the team.    Another possible cost: our competition team held their practices at a local cheer gym, where professional coaches ran the practices and choreographed the routine.  The cost for that was $100 a month for each team member (Aug-Dec) plus $3000 for the music & choreography.  Of course, you don't have to do that.  If your school's cheer coaches have the knowledge & experience, they could do all that right there at school, for no extra cost.    To pay for all that, we held several fundraisers that only the competition team members participated in.  (No fair making all the cheerleaders do it, if they're not all on the comp. team).  Be prepared to suggest some fundraisers when you present your idea.  Our team held a cheer clinic for elementary school students; sponsored a school Halloween dance; and held some "spirit nights" at local restaraunts, where we served the customers and got a portion of the evening's profits, plus tips.    I hope this gives you a good head start for forming a competitive team at your school!  Good luck with it!  =)|`|KlIhfO6naa	yes you can because ive seen it happen in High school.
PvIFahGjaa	Show him you want to play the most. Hustle the most, pay attention when he talks, focus,  when he talks to you individually look him in the eyes ( not like a gay look in the eyes but just show him you are paying attention and dont look down or away when he talks to you), if he shakes your hand make it a tight hand shake. Just little things like that show the kind of person you are. Never walk on the field. Dont show up to tryouts with your hat on backwards and your jersey or shirt not tucked in. Show up looking like a baseball player. Dont wear skateboarding shoes to tryouts either ( I hate when kids do that) . Do whatever the coach tells you to do. Dont mess around with your friends or other people. Show up with a good attitude. When you're trying out, don't compare yourself to the other players, be relaxed, and just have fun and be confident.|`|KVfxa6Coaa	good grades and a good attitude|`|gVYfFSpRaa	I have 2 tips for you:  1. play good baseball  2. have confidence|`|PJF4J3iYaa	hustle..do everything at 100%, dont be afraid to talk to the coaches. do anything to help out|`|rAZ6EXK2aa	I think youre on the right track.  Most importantly, be willing to do whatever it takes or play wherever you need to in order to make the team better.  Coaches like to have "team guys" out there, and you increase your chances of playing as well.  Focus on the small things, mechanics and fundamentals.  Get those down and be coachable.  Know the game, study the game, use your head.  Coaches want a smart player out there on the field, someone who knows what to do in certain situations.  Show an ability to be a leader, and most importantly lead by example.  This includes on the field as well as off of it.  You dont have to have the most natural skill (though it helps) to be a good, fundamentally sound HS baseball player.  Ill say it again, be coachable and if you really want to play and make the team, dont just rely on the couple hours a day you get out there to practice.  Take it home with you, work on the things on which you are coached.  That shows dedication and commitment as well as leadership.    And good luck!|`|zdQgOzYXaa	actually, passing your high school classes is the most important part!|`|tvy8qFKCaa	Generally coaches do not like people who refuse to use the caps button, so you might want to just forget it. But if you ask this question another six or seven times, your odds of making the team will increase.    Hope this helps.|`|3sxK2xQKaa	Good grades and put the team first.

The reason why somebody doesn't invest in Leeds is because all the rich foreign business men think of buying a club as a bit of fun and not as a reality. They want trophies, success and recognition instantly and it is harder to get that from a lower league club. However, if they did buy invest considerably in Leeds they would become very popular amongst our massive fan base and it would be enjoyable for them and for us. I don't think this will happen in the near future unless something happens to Uncle Ken or we get promoted back to where we belong.|`|dKi2R2oHaa	They are waiting for Leeds to be promoted to the Championship.

urL4MGSvaa	Height isn't necessary if your a WA or C - As the person says above me your better off recieving bounce passes or running to the ball to recieve it - Practice dodging so you can recieve the ball into open spaces - and fitness, if your fit as a fiddle you can run rings around your taller opponents     If your playing GK and marking a taller player your best option is to block the shooter from getting a closer shot - let them take the long shots - soon as the shoot, turn your back and back into your partner and block them from trying to recieve the rebound - you should be able to get that if you perform it right|`|578pyGrhaa	You are the same as me. I find it difficult to mark tall players. You have to be more aggressive and don't do contact. If they try and push you forward lean on them, always be in front of them when ever you can and maybe ask your team player before the match to pass bounce passes around/underneath other defenders so that it's easier for you.

Maybe put him in as a goalie first and you shoot towards him. Harden him up.

Did you when he was younger play around with him like rough games? Try doing that, he won't be as scared then.

Try telling him and showing him that it can be fun to have it a bit rough but don't pressure him.Good Luck!|`|O9NHDTj3aa	i think you need to tell your kid that when he has the ball every1 wants to get it off him so when they have the ball he has to try get it off them,there is a good game you can play to help him out for that situation its called the eye get about 6 kids,1 in the middle and 5 all round forming a circle all the players in the circle have to pass to each other and the kid in the middle has to challenge to try win the ball when he gets a good touch on the ball he goes into the circle and the other kid goes into the middle i think this would help him in both of your questions and if i have helped you can you plz give me the best answer thanx.|`|InCpu9Vfaa	he might be afraid of the other team being mad at him for taking the ball     away    hahahahaha      just ask him

xxtvhn5Naa	Chad Javon Ochocinco (born Chad Javon Johnson January 9, 1978 in Miami, Florida, USA) is an American football wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League. He was drafted by the Bengals in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He played college football at Oregon State.  Ocho Cinco has been selected to the Pro Bowl five times and named an All-Pro three times. He legally changed his surname from Johnson to Ochocinco prior to the 2008 regular season to reflect his Bengals uniform number.      Cincinnati Bengals  No. 85  Wide receiver  Date of birth: January 9, 1978 (age 31)  Place of birth: Miami, Florida  Height: 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) Weight: 192 lb (87 kg)        College: Oregon State  NFL Draft: 2001 / Round: 2 / Pick: 36   Teams:  Cincinnati Bengals (2001-present)        2x First-Team All-Pro selection (2005, 2006)  1x Second-Team All-Pro selection (2003)  5x Pro Bowl selection (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007)      Receptions     612  Receiving Yards     8,905  Receiving TDs     53          Bengals franchise records  Ocho Cinco holds the following records in the Bengals organization:  Most receiving yards in a season (1,440)  Most receiving yards all-time  Most receiving touchdowns (49)  Most receiving yards in a game (260)  Most seasons with over 1,000 receiving yards (6)  Most touchdown receptions in a game (3, tied with several other players)        On October 25, 2006, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, when his last name was still Johnson, he announced that he would prefer to be called "Ocho Cinco" ("8-5" in Spanish, though 85 actually reads as "ochenta y cinco" in Spanish). During warm-ups for the October 29, 2006 game against the Atlanta Falcons, the back of his jersey read "Ocho Cinco" instead of "C. Johnson". Quarterback Carson Palmer ripped the label off the jersey to reveal the usual "C. Johnson". According to ESPN, Ocho Cinco was fined US$5,000 for the stunt despite the fact that Ocho Cinco did not wear the "Ocho Cinco" name tag during the game.  He legally changed his name to Chad Javon Ocho Cinco on August 29, 2008. The Cincinnati Bengals decided to allow him to have it on the back of his jersey, however Ocho Cinco has stated that he will continue to wear his old "C. Johnson" jersey during the 2008 football season due to financial obligations with Reebok.        Personal    Ocho Cinco is a cousin of current NFL cornerback Samari Rolle and former NFL wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.  Ocho Cinco has four children: Jicyra, Chad Johnson II, Chade and Chaiel.  On May 5, 2007, Ocho Cinco was sued for allegedly not giving away a Lexus that was supposed to be raffled off. The suit added two plaintiffs that claimed that they have won trips from Ocho Cinco (one to Europe; one to Hawaii), that Ocho Cinco never awarded.  On June 9, 2007, Ocho Cinco raced a thoroughbred racehorse over a furlong (220 yards / 200 meters) for charity. Ocho Cinco, given a 110-yard (100 m) head start, beat the horse by twelve lengths.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Chad" Ocho 'STINKO'" Johmson|`|U7oDXHglaa	who cares?|`|2kUHectjaa	Had a bad year due to the Bengals being awful and not having Carson Palmer.|`|2UT79f9Jaa	good player on a bad team|`|jUs6hygQaa	Ocho Cinco means Eight Five.

Sarcasm? lol|`|nAtBuBRhaa	Well, Rodney Harrison was apart of a real good defense in New England, when Bob Sanders (with a little help by Dwight Freeney) turned that whole defense around to an elite defense. Which he received the Defense Player of the Year award with it. He's also a hard hitter, and he's really fast. Rodney Harrison is a good player don't get me wrong, but Bob Sanders is better.|`|AA10495394	I will take Harrison, the one that played for the Chargers. Bob can't stay on the football field.

I should have when I was in Kentucky and they played in the 2005 SB in Detroit...just a short 6 hours away...|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	It's a lot of fun. You have cars, trucks, SUV's all over. People have their grills out, coolers, beer. Everyone's decked in their packer gear. Footballs are being tossed and thrown in between cars. The atmosphere is chaotic, yet somehow organized. Everyone's friendly and laughing getting ready for the game. Last game I tailgated was the 2007 season against the Raiders. We won, and when we came out we mini-tailgated again while the parking lot cleared out.  Good times.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Yea, it was AMAZING|`|axxQzOCHaa	Not for "American" football. The only time I was in Washington DC (I'm a Redskins fan) was in the summertime.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Yeah, I tailgated for the Pats in the parking lot of the Black Hole... before and after the Patriots kicked their a** all over the field.

The game starts at 1. The gates open around 8 or 9. You bring whatever you want. Food and drink. You get your bbq going and your beer on ice and party. They try to keep open flames away and make you put your beer in a cup instead of drinkin out of the botle or can. I don't know why. The music is blaring. The footballs and frisbees are in the air. Everybody is everybodys friend. The scalpers are walking around sellin and buyin tickets. The girls from the nearby tittie bars are handing out coupons for after the game. Police ride around and laugh at people. Bring a bucket to pee in. Near game time you grab 2 beers for the walk in and have to finish them before you get inside. There is so much partying going on there used to be an unwritten rule that the Eagles couldn't have 4 o clock home games cause the fans would be too "rowdy". Also the reason I don't go that much cause I"ve been known to not remember the first half of games. Let's just say bthat it's a good time. Rain or shine. Hot or cold.
1uSoU8Lpaa	Unreal, I counted 7 in a row, SEVEN one right after another. There have been easily hundreds. I keep laughing when I see them. You'd think someone would at least look at the football section first before asking that question, save 5 points and read their exact question.

But I don't get upset if there are lots out there, as we all don't have the exact same contacts down to the letter, and no one can be on the pc 24-7, and not everyone has time to check the response of others to questions they answered!|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Like about 1 Million of them I'll happy when people stop asking by Monday because they'll say the Steelers are Super Bowl 43 Champions.

Check out drsquat.com, they have some good information on assessing caloric intake needs for losing weight, maintaining, and gaining weight for sports.

7100wGi3aa	I say, regular season MVP.<br>  <br>  Finals MVP was conceived a token award to Jerry West, after losing to Russell and the Celtics. for the sixth time (Dont worry, Russell and Havlicek have token awards of their own, DPoY and Sixth man respectively).<br>  <br>  The problem with Finals MVP is like this.<br>  -Parker won the Finals MVP in 2k7 but we all know Tim Duncan is the heart and soul of the Spurs.<br>  -James Worthy won a Finals MVP in '88(?) but is he really more important to the championship fortunes of the Lakers than Magic?<br>  <br>  The problem with Finals MVP is that the evaluation criteria involved in order to receive the award is very NARROW. The evaluation period spans only 4-7 games. Also, the performance of the potential Finals MVP winner is based only against one team. There is no variety. More often roster matchups between the two teams dictate that particular player's performance.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  |`|eQpYnh2Paa	its very difficult because at the end of the say they are both wonderful acheivements!!<br>  MVP means that u have earned it over 82 games and a long tough season.<br>  Finals MVP means u have earned it over quite a short time but playing at a higher level than regular season.<br>  A very hard choice but i would say Finals MVP!|`|v2WaSemMaa	Yeah Dirk got MVP, and a 1 seed in the playoffs. But his team lost to an 8 seed (Golden State Warriors) in the first round of the playoffs. Some MVP.|`|IKrL9NGhaa	MVP by far.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Finals MVP is the greater accomplishment.  Ask every NBA player what is their goal and they'll tell you to win a championship.  So don't you think all the NBA stars want to be the best at the biggest stage.. the finals.  Leading your team to a championship or being the best during the regular season.  I bet 100% of NBA stars would say leading my team to championship which would give you the NBA finals MVP.  Most of the greats don't show there best during all 82 games, plus you play several scrub teams during an 82 game season.  The finals puts you up against the best competition of the season playing at there highest level.  The best teams in the regular season who already clinch a playoff spot rest there players as well during the end of the season.  I believe Kevin Garnet, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe, STeve Nash would all trade there regular season MVP for a finals MVP.  <br>  <br>  Think about this...out of all the NBA finals only 1 player received it on a losing team.  HOw many regular season MVP's did not win a finals MVP..off the top of my head i count 6 in the last 8 years.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	I Think That The MVP IS BETTER THAN THE FINALS MVP<br>  <br>  <br>  Because <br>  <br>  It Takes 82 Matches<br>  <br>  And <br>  <br>  That Means That He led His Team To The play offs Even When They SUCK<br>  <br>  And Dallas Were A SUCK TEAM Because They Lost Early in The Play offs<br>  <br>  But A Great Nowitzki Led Them To The Play offs|`|wmWrcN0faa	Whenever you hear people talk about great players.  They almost always mention how many regular season MVP awards that players has won.  However, they almost never mention Finals MVP awards.  The regular season MVP is a much tougher accomplishment.  It takes consistently great basketball over an 82 game span.  That's NOT easy to do.  Plus you're competing with the entire league for that award and not just the players from the 2 teams represented in the NBA Finals.|`|7Kcj9HJJaa	The season is 82 games long, to be awarded the MVP for the season you have to beat out 100's of players over a long time span.  The NBA Finals is only 7 games and you are competing against 20 plus players.<br>  <br>  So it is safe to say that the Season MVP is a far accomplishment than Finals MVP.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>   |`|cWRls0mmaa	I would say Wade winning title, MVP dont matter in regular season, title matter after the season ends.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dirk was voted for MVP I dont get it, Nash tried his best he didnt get it.

Every star wants another star or 2 to help them win an NBa championships.  Here are some stars that thought they could do it by themselves and failed doing so:  MJ, Kobe Bryant, Tracy Mcgrady, Wilt Chamberlain, Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce.  Those are just some of the starts that thought they were so good that it didn't matter who was on there team there going to win.  As you can see they all are still the best on there teams (beside GP) but they had to make major changes on there outlook of winning a ring.  It's a tough lesson for the great players to be humble and realize they can't do it alone.  Bill Russell is the only player that got it right the first time.  All the players above me had to go thru years of great stats but no championship.  They all realized after the fact that they can lead the league in every statistical category, but that won't bring them a ring and it's nice to see they all are at that point in there career now.<br>  <br>  And the stats prove it, not 1 star on a mediocre team has won a championship.  Isn't that the whole reason to play the game.|`|q0rDcTSRaa	A star of a mediocre team because you never know the team might get better in the future maybe win championships look at the Lakers they were just about a mediocre team in 2006 and look what happened they got to the NBA Finals.

LIKkt8djaa	Yes even if it's new you should still wax it, Most boards do come pre-waxed however it's just a thin amount of factory wax meant to act as a protective layer from dirt and dust while sitting on the shelf, It wont even last you the day.

nKSmgjylaa	I remeber ya! Nice to see you back, and a great return question. (:    HBK = Undertaker  Two absolute complete and utter legends who are still going strong. It'd be wrong to claim one is the better of the 2, they are equal.    Mic Skills   I prefer an actual wrestling match to listening to a person talking. Mic Skills are extremetly imprortant nowadays too though.    Kurt Angle = Bret Hart  2 great submission specialists and as I am a hige fan of both guys, I'm rating them as equal.    Survivor Series   The Rumble is the beginning of the Road To Wrestlemania, and it's my second favourite PPV of the year.    RAW = Smackdown.  Both shows are amazing. SD with Matt, Jeff, Edge, and lil miss excuse me herself. RAW is unpredictable and live.    US Championship   More legendary names have been on the IC Title. It's just a more important and prestigeous championship to me.    Kane > Big Show.  I respect Kane big time. Who else would have said that helping get young guys over would mean more than a title reign?    Randy Orton   Edge has been around longer. He's my favourite heel, and his TLC matches have to be seen to be believed.    Andres Streak   One word, WRESTLEMANIA. There is more excitment behind 'Takers streak. 15 years is impressive, but he could've lost the streak any week with no build up. Undertakers storylines for WM keep you guessing and have a huge build up.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Good One...STARRED!!

Mic Skills     Kurt Angle > Breat Hart- Kurt is just slightly better. I almost wanted to say equal, but I had to take into consideration a few different things. Kurt is just all around awesome, and arguably the best pure wrestler ever to grace a wrestling ring.     Survivor Series     Raw > Smackdown- Raw, it is the flagship program. It has more special episodes, the bigger events, storylines, and matches always take place there, and it's live.    US Title     Kane = Big Show- Both are the same to me. Kane is more athletic and puts on a better match, but Big Show has had more sucess and is a bigger name than Kane. I love it when they team and when they feud.    Randy Orton = Edge- Both play a great heel role, put on great matches, and know how to work a crowd and sell. They both work well on the mic, have had great success throughout their careers and are very talented, with more great things to come in the future.    Andre the Giant's 15 Year Undefeated Streak = Taker 16-0 WM Streak  It's an incredible streak vs. a phenominal streak, both amazing, and can't choose between the two. I personally appreciate Taker's more though.    Great question, I never would've thought of a question like this before, very unique and interesting. I'm gonna star, and welcome back!

Just a mock..|`|i1SQSUp1aa	VIAGRA is an oral medication for erectile dysfunction (ED). It helps most men with ED improve their erections. That means they are able to achieve harder erections.    Getting an erection is only half the story  Maintaining an erection is just as important as getting one. VIAGRA can help with both. This can lead to a more satisfying sexual experience with your partner.    Who can take VIAGRA  VIAGRA has an established safety profile of over 10 years. It has been shown to work safely and effectively in men with ED. This includes:    * Men of all ages  * Men who have difficulty all the time or just some of the time  * Men with other health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression    What is erectile dysfunction?  ED is when a man has problems getting or maintaining an erection long enough for sex. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis.    ED isnt the same for all men. Some men arent able to get an erection at all. Others can get one, but its not hard enough for sex. And others get a hard erection but lose it before or during sex.    ED is a medical condition. So in most cases, erections will not improve without treatment.    A common issue  ED is more common than you might think. More than half of all men over 40 have some difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. The fact is, guys at any age can experience ED.    Treatment works  If you think you might have ED, theres something you can do. Ask your doctor about treatment. Most men with ED can significantly improve their erections. And better erections can mean better sex.    Find out if VIAGRA is right for you. Speak to your doctor. He can tell you if you have ED. And can recommend an effective treatment|`|kKxCevttaa	its pretty good but i want the seahawks to get a QB really bad

085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	Double hits on the first ball over the net are legal if it is one attempt to play the ball.  <br>  Double hits on the second and third contacts are called.  <br>  Lifts/carries are called on all 3 team contacts.  <br>  Ball not making it over the net and foot faults on the serve are also called as you said. <br>  If someone is completely across the centerline is also a violation.  <br>  People in the net are also called if they are in the act of playing the ball.  <br>  <br>  When you get ready to start the warmups, you call the captains over.  Explain the ground rules to the captains.  Let the visitor call the coin toss.  The winner of the toss gets to choose whether or not to serve OR they can choose the side.  The loser of the toss gets the other choice.  <br>  Warmups can be 5 and 1 as you have described.  <br>  You should start the players on the endline.  When everyone is there, whistle and move your hands toward the middle and they should move around the outer edge of the court to shake hands.  They will then line up on the court.  <br>  At the end of the set, you can have the teams switch sides.  You are correct.  The team that served first in the first set will receive the first serve in the second set.  <br>  If you go to a deciding set, you will need to do a new coin toss.  <br>  Whistle LOUDLY.  A loud whistle and strong signals might make people think you are an experienced referee.  I usually whistle time outs and subs longer and just as loud.  I will sometimes even double whistle them to make sure people look at me.  (Not whistle, pause, and then whistle.  I mean tweet,tweet)<br>  Good luck.  You at least have more notice than I had for my first match.  I was dating a player on the college team where I was going to school.  I was the flipper.  The referees got snowed out and the visiting team was already there.  They asked if I would referee.  It was too expensive to have the teams reschedule and travel again.  I agreed and I refereed my first ever match at the college level.  In 1971.  |`|TSnmDMOFaa	I find the hardest part of my job knowing where everybody is on the court, determining front row and back row players, and determining if they are correct in serve receive formation.  Determining next server is difficult sometimes too.  In NYC high school matches, officials don't have the luxury of having an R2 to determine position faults on the receiving team.  The trick I use is to find some similarities on players opposite each other.  It sucks to call it, but if you see it, and one team's gaining an advantage, you have to blow the whistle for position faults.<br>  <br>  The most important part is calling the hands consistently.  If you can do that, the coaches and players will respect you more.  <br>  <br>  Take the course, it'll probably help loads.  It helped me a ton.|`|dpmW5zrBaa	When you drop the coin one chose the serve or side. If the first one chose to serve the other one chose the side. They switch sides every set.<br>  Also you have to blow the whistle before every serve. They cannot serve before that.|`|y58cs6TZaa	Wow, you're one nervous referee ;D|`|8aabc45667b207f732475c8884a9e598aa	call the captains after worm up  how is the home team|`|chhiJEafaa	Ok...

Then you give them 1 minute of serving.<br>  <br>  Then while the coaches are giving a pep talk to their players you call captains... When you flip a coin, whoever wins gets to pick if they want to serve or not serve first.<br>  <br>  You may make the players shake hands.<br>  <br>  Yes, you get 1 minute time out and 8 seconds to serve.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that helps you!<br>

o8ldhBfsaa	For Hamilton: Good as Schumacher on track: that one we will never know. <br>  As for the records theoretically Hamilton got more than enough time to beat all Shumi's records, but with the new rules and regulations every year trying to close the gap between cars I think 5 wins per season is the average the champion can get and with 10 years (max) ahead of Hamilton and 9 wins so far Hamilton will get around 50-70 wins if he stays in a top team and keeps his head up and that isn't even close to Schumacher's 91 wins. Maybe he will manage to break so few records (pole positions). Also 6 season wins out of the next 10 (if he wins this year) seems hard to get with the red team not sitting back and the rising BMW.<br>  <br>  About Alonso: He is already one of the all time greats. He is the only man to beat Schumacher twice. He is the only driver after Schumacher to score more than 100 points in three consecutive seasons. Also he is the youngest world champion or at least the second youngest world champion if Hamilton won this year. Only Spanish double world champion. First title for Renault. Winner of the first F1 GP held at night. Least number of races to score 500 points. <br>  I think and hope Alonso will sin a third title but not with Renault more likely with Scuderia if he joined the Red team.|`|yjVSqG3baa	Lewis certainly has shown he has what it takes to be a great driver, and as he has come straight into a front running team, he may be able to be as good as Michael and match his level of wins. <br>  <br>  As for Fernando, yes he is one of the good drivers, and with a good car I think its possible for him to achieve a 3rd world championship at some point in the future, but I personally think to be classed as 'one of the all time greats', he needs to work in harmony with his team more like Michael and indeed Lewis does. |`|OcmUW298aa	You people that mention Hamilton and any of the past greats in the same breath must be on something.  Don't know what it is but it must be good.  He will never be able to lace the boots of people like SCHU.or Senna etc hes a loud mouthed arrogant piece of sh%￡.  Granted he can drive but to even think about him being equal with past masters is total rubbish.  He will show true colours soon and all you Lewis loonies will have to eat your words,   you people cant see the wood for the trees,   but hes English and that says it all. go for it Lewis,break a leg,   both of them if you like.|`|O4CimCZuaa	There is absolutely no one that can match the success of Michael Schumacher. It would be a long time before we see someone as good as him!<br>  <br>  To answer your 2nd question: Yes, I think Fernando can win a third title. All he needs is to be in a good team that can give him a car that'll help him win. The R28 wasn't a good car at all, but look at what Fernando was able to do with the car. After the 2nd place qualifying in Barcelona, the car has slowly improved with of course setbacks. His victory in Japan just showed how great the car has improved. <br>  <br>  If Fernando stays with Renault in '09 (and there's a good chance that it will happen), there is a good chance that with the new rules/regulations, he could very well be a title contender!|`|Am0PVlmOaa	Not a hope.Beside winning 7 world titles you need to remember that Schumacher was not always in the best car.Also he helped to build the Ferrari team to what it is now.Alonso is the best driver on the grid this year and will definitely win another title,maybe with Renault who are making good progress if not then with Ferrari who will sigh him in the next couple of years|`|4j5PbHsOaa	i think lewis will be better than schumi as MS won his first title in 94 aged 25? so lewis has 3year on him on this stat should he win the WC on sunday, most drivers retire about 35ish. this gives lewis about 12yrs to become the greatest ever F1 driver!!!|`|xAAqFvPgaa	Ok he is really good driver. But why not say could kubitza be as good as shumacer? first hamilton needs to win one championship and when he wins 3 then we can start asking these questions.

May be with Renault, maybe another team. But he stands a good chance of a third - he is a great driver, after all.<br>  <br>  As for Hamilton? He probably will win the championship once or twice. I don't know if he will manage it this year, despite him having a 7 point lead (anything can happen, and Massa has the advantage should they tie on points, since he has more wins and more 2nd places). I don't know if he could be as good as Schumacher, certainly there is plenty time for him to equal or beat what Schumacher managed. But I don't think he will be quite as good, somehow. Time will tell.<br>  |`|3Db7KL0naa	.<br>  <br>  I hope that Lewis can secure his first WDC in Brasil next Sunday and without resorting to the same tactics Schhhhh used to put himself on the map. <br>  <br>  That said it is far too early to say if Lewis can be as good as Schhh. When driving within the bounds of all reasonableness he was a joy to watch, able to squeeze every last tenth out of a lack lustre car, galvanise a whole team around him and put himself in places that influenced a number of F1 decisions. An extremely bright and resourceful talent.<br>  <br>  At this stage in his career I consider Lewis less rounded, but supremely gifted as regards car control. It remains to be seen as to whether he can dig deep when given a donkey to drive and also how much he can mould McLaren around him. He hasn't done too shoddily so far though, seeing off double WDC Alonso and getting so close last year. <br>  <br>  Alonso....what can be said? He's shown this year that even with a substandard car he can do what few can do on the grid. When he has the team around him he is a joy to behold and I don't think there's a reader that thought he'd take two race wins with that escargot of a car this season. Excellent.<br>  <br>  He's got at least three WDC in him with the right drive.<br>  <br>  We've a good few years of racing ahead if the cars have similar performance, with Lewis, Kubica, Kimi, Alonso, Rosberg, Vettel and Di Resta and some of the GP2 lads coming thru, we should be very very lucky....!<br>  <br>  . |`|XXm2yCHiaa	I think Lewis can be as good as Schumi, but he may not dominate the sport the way Schumi and Ferrari did.<br>  <br>  Alsonso's 3rd championship will depend on where he goes in the next few years and the performance of the car.  |`|IUw0f5u5aa	I think Lewis Hamilton will be even better than Schumacher - he is a much nicer person - and look how young he is - and even better he is British!!!<br>  Fernando Alonso needs to stop moaning as he did when driving with Lewis Hamilton|`|UTql7vKkaa	Alonso will win a 3rd title as long as he gets a competitive car, maybe it will be the Renault, maybe not.<br>  <br>  Hamilton has the potential to be a great driver, but he's yet to win even 1 WDC so any talk of it now is premature.  However, he's won 9 races compared to Schumacher's 1 in his first 2 seasons, so he's not had a bad start.<br>  <br>  We'll have a better idea in about 9 days time.<br>  |`|qQtRmyXEaa	Hamilton isn't as good yet. But yes, he could be as good as Schumacher, in terms of both skill and record breaking.<br>  <br>  I think Alonso probably will win another world championship at some point as well. He's still a relatively young driver and has several years yet to see himself into a championship contending car again.|`|fnCbVvaoaa	I think Lewis Hamilton is a legend to be honest. He is so young and has a great career ahead of him. I'm not to sure if he would be as good as Schumacher though... Alonso is a good driver too. He needs to beat Hamilton in a few more Grand Prix before he can be an all time great I think.|`|3f10efdc062c7553650a50749b7e7aacaa	Well Alonso ain't gonna win this year is he?<br>  <br>  Hamilton is in great form and only needs a 5th place to win championship.<br>  <br>  Not bad for 2nd year in F1<br>  <br>  Time will tell if he can match Schumachers success but I don't see why not.|`|aVb80BGPaa	It's way to early to make big predictions about Hamilton. Don't forget  Schumacher could have won more championships if he hadn't moved to Ferrari in 1996.<br>  <br>  Alonso - if he gets a competitve car then he could win it next year!|`|NB42ZXSKaa	Nope!<br>  <br>  He has had a wonderful start to his F1 career but didn't a certain Jacques Villeneuve as well! I'm sure he'll win a lot of titles but won't be as good as MS.|`|o3I2iVdyaa	easy answer is never.he will soon get dumped by mclaren and when he does he will need skill not just a fast car|`|ziVpIxQ9aa	maybe
qThmcR1Aaa	It's 4 points for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 bonus point for scoring four or more tries, and 1 bonus point for losing by seven or fewer points.<br>  <br>  So with bonus points figured in, a winner could get as many as 5 points total. A tied club could get 3 total, and a losing team could get as many as 2 (if they scored four or more tries but still lost by seven or fewer points).|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	You can get a bonus point in two ways.<br>  <br>  1. You score four tries in a single match. The tries do not have to be converted.<br>  <br>  2. You lose by less than seven points.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can get more than one bonus point if you score four tries and lose by less than seven. However you only get the one point for scoring four tries, e.g you don't get two for scoring eight tries.
UTql7vKkaa	I think it was a lot lower than 15G, that's more than a fighter pilot can pull before blacking out and they were special G suits.  Fighter pilots can take about 9G max.<br>  <br>  The most I've ever read about is 5G, the cars that probably produced most speed were the turbos of the mid 1980s that could produce over 1,000HP - however, the Interlagos circuit wasn't used between 1980 and 1990, they used the Jacarepaguá circuit at Rio de Janiro instead.<br>  <br>  Fastest lap I can find for the longer track was in 1980, when René Arnoux recorded 2:27.31 in the race.<br>  <br>  I've read somewhere that during accidents drivers can achieve about 100G, but obviously only for very short periods of time and it's not much fun.|`|WDphfiVRaa	Its not true.<br>  only if you slam into a wall<br>  <br>  Some interesting stuff anyway about F1 and G force.<br>  <br>  An F1 car produces enough downforce to drive upside down at aprox" 150mph.<br>  <br>  Pretty sure they clock the 1/4 mile in about a flat 7.<br>  <br>  Engines have restrictions and are limited to around 19500rpm.<br>  <br>  However, to really see some extreme G's, <br>  Would highly reccommend "Red Bull Air racing"  Those crazy pilots continuously pull around 10.5 and even close to 12 G|`|iwlE1Abnaa	I suppose it may be possible to pull 15G but it does sound awfully high to me too.

6ahTfnVuaa	Ankle Weights do not help a lot.     Do jumping exercises for a few weeks. Jump Rope, Jumping Jacks, and Jumping over objects. After weeks off training it will work for you.     I am 6' 6'' and when I was 18 (6' 3'') I wanted to dunk badly, so a friend told me to do the above, and it worked. I was able to dunk at the GYM.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Then you have problems because i'm 5-10 and can grab the rim easy on a college court.. You need to place some weights on your ankles and just walk with them on for about a month like 10 pounds on each leg.. Then when you take them off you should feel lighter and your legs a bit stronger|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Ankle weight work and you probably just mismeasured the rim in your house.|`|GBGcI509aa	Thumose is right.|`|6RQQ8r7saa	im 5ft8 and i can grab rim in a gym but not outside.

Also practice jumping as high as you can, 50-100 times daily. Not only will this increase your vertical, it will improve your overall form. Jumping with the right form, can instantly give you an additional 2"-3" on your vertical.    -Ankle weights are usually useless, for building muscle or training. Ankle weights typically only weigh 3-5lbs, equivalent to the weight of a pair of boots.

John Spano bought the team in 1996. He never made any of the payments to the former owner, John Pickett. An investigation by Newsday, a Long Island newspaper, showedcSpano deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth. He also had two lawsuits pending against him at the time. He would up being sentenced to 5 years and 11 months for bank and wire fraud.|`|qyT5rsFZaa	John Spano. He made a mockery of the Isles.

WiIUEObTaa	tiger shark clubs were designed by pat simminons. during the 1980s most advanced irons on the market. like other companies could not keep up to the big three financially , scaled down production. these irons were played on p g a tour . both mens and womens. first company to make gap wedge available. very good set . worth the price. |`|XsZsk55Jaa	I'm not familiar with the set and it may be quite good but frankly my advice to any beginner is to buy a used set of clubs that are a few years old.  You can probably get a full set of what was considered top of the line pro equipment, with many years of play left in them, for less than the price of the Tiger Sharks, and if you don't like them or the game you can resell them for close to what you paid.  There should be a few golf shops in your neighborhood that sell used sets or try eBay or Craigs list.  <br>  <br>  There are quite a few golfers who believe that if only they had the right set of clubs they would be on the pro tour.  They spend thousands of dollars on clubs only to sell then a few months later for pennies on the dollar.|`|MqH16sPaaa	The clubs themselves are not as important starting out as the size of the clubs.  A basketball player wouldn't just buy shoes because they look good, you buy ones that fit.  Its hard to run in shoes that are too small and the same thing goes for golf clubs.  Whether you spent $200 or $2000 on clubs, make sure you go and get them fitted to your size before ordering.  I can tell you that I played golf for a year before I learned that, and when I finally got clubs that fit, the game became much easier because I was able to swing naturally and without bending over too much.  Also make sure that the weight of the clubs are comfortable for you to take a natural relaxed swing at.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.  Its a beautiful, addictive and frustrating game.  I would play twice a day if I could.|`|6Yz964WPaa	Yes it looks like a decent starter set, comes with everything you need to start playing the game.  One word of advice, don't listen to all these people saying you should go get fitted and this and that.  You are just starting out and you are buying inexpensive clubs so you can begin to learn the game.  Getting fitted and custom sizing are things that accomplished golfers do and I'm sure you're not looking to spend the money it costs for all these advanced features.  You can do that later on if you continue to play the game.   Good luck and enjoy the game.|`|MWGRlJfZaa	420cc Forged Driver with Graphite Shaft. <br>  Oversized 3 and 5 woods with Graphite Shafts. <br>  Hybrid Design #4 Wood / Iron with Steel Shaft. <br>  5 Iron - Sand Wedge with Steel Shafts. <br>  Mallet Style Putter. <br>  Four Matching Headcovers. <br>  Lightweight Dual-Sling Stand Bag. <br>  Available in MRH and MLH. <br>  Set features Full-Color Set Box<br>  <br>  seems pretty good|`|GNNh52OMaa	thinking long term = no<br>  thinking short term = sure|`|961133a1c596ff2fd7bb41485158527baa	To a certain extent, you get what you pay for. I'm not familiar with this manufacturer but there are a couple of things I'd argue with in the makeup of the set: mainly, that there's no Sand Wedge - this really is a club that any beginner should carry. It's much more important for you than, say, the 5-wood. If you go for this set try to pick up a second-hand SW from a local golf shop.<br>  <br>  Build quality is not likely to be as good as better-known makes. You won't be able to get these clubs adjusted for length or lie, but as a beginner this is probably only an issue if you're shorter than, say, 5'8" or taller than about 6'2".<br>  <br>  However, if you're new to the game and on a very limited budget, it's better to buy these and get used to them than to use loan sets from the course and play with different clubs each time. However, I'd suggest you also look for a second-hand set in a local newspaper: get someone who knows a bit about golf to go with you (so you don't buy something 30 years out of date), but sometimes you'll get great value.<br>  <br>  If you get hooked on the game, you'll want a better set in two years time - but you'll know when that time comes.|`|t7fLssYMaa	yes it should be good enough for a starter set. If you are young (16-55yrs old) make sure to get a steel shaft in the irons. graphite is for older guys who don't swing hard so they need the extra whip the graphite will give them. I have a taylor made set for sale if you are interested. Bag, steel irons 3-pitching wedge +sand wedge +putter (all taylor made brand).

0xfVyxxIaa	Dan Carter.    Mehrtens was calm, class and a reliable kicker. Spencer was very unpredictable and on his day could turn any backline. Wilkinson was a great boot and a good defender. But none have a proficiancy in all the skills like Carter has.    O'Gara doesn't even belong amongst the others.    EDIT To 'Bill P': Winning the 'world cup' an unachieved pinnacle? I hope you're joking! By that logic Joel Stransky was better than those you ran down. Where talking about ability here, not what was won by teams they played for.     Especially considering what a joke competition the RWC usually is...|`|0IuWhmWUaa	Carter or Spencer.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Larkham was the best over the last 10 years. Wilkinson won a world cup with his kicking, Larkham won one with his football ability. Carter, Spencer and Mehrtens were all good but the World Cup is still the pinnacle which these players have not yet achieved.|`|N5yp2TiRaa	Dan Carter....He's the third best EVER, after Barry John and Phil Bennett.|`|GQpTI2GWaa	Carter is tops.     Wilkinson second.|`|633rZVfyaa	Definitely DC because there is no other 1st 5 in the world that has skills like him. In second place I would say Jonny Wilkinson because he is a fantastic kicker but really thats about it.|`|HWmjIOaBaa	Spencer, because he brings out the best in his backline|`|7WaNwojqaa	mat giteau looking good got many years ahead to get better too,carter up there but donald duck could play 1st 5/8 for allblacks and break records too,|`|7vIfwtvFaa	mehrtans is the best on that list, cause he was able to gain field possession unlike anyother up there and he could run like carter and control then game. the one thing that would stop him from becoming great would have been his def cause he ccouldn't tackle to save his life. and giteau shouldn't be up there cause he ain't that good at first/five he is a centre and will always be one, larkham should be up there he was the best in the last 10 years no one has been as good as him since probably grant fox.|`|ETarSy9Maa	Definitely Mehrtens or Wilkinson.  At the moment I'm thinking Mehrtens, he turned in a lot more great performances than Wilkinson, more consistent I guess.|`|Pa3LKeBtaa	Spencer|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	Based on what he achieved, I'm going to say Wilkinson in his prime. He was basically relied on by England to win the world cup and he did it. Not mention he's probably one of the best defensive out halfs around. Though I think Carter will overtake him soon enough.|`|ehfe97Zcaa	I'm amazed there's even any debates.    Dan Carter, as much as I'm not really a fan of his, completely eclipses all of these first fives.     In terms of overall raw talent, both Giteau and Spencer are there or there abouts as well, and perhaps Mehrts right behind them.     In terms of a player able to control a game, it's Carter then daylight.    Wilkinson is not a great rugby player. That's just the god's honest truth. He's a phenomenal kicker, but his ability to read a rugby field, to open defenses, to free up his support is VERY average.
DjifToZgaa	Both are technically "timeshare" backs.  Turner has Norwood, and Mendenhall is Parker's complement.<br>  <br>  Atlanta is paying Turner a lot of money to start, so he'll get as many carries as they can pile on.<br>  <br>  Of the two, Turner is a starter, and more the proven commodity.  I have him in a keeper league, but I am not expecting him to be anything more than a backup or flex player.<br>  <br>  Atlanta's QB situation is dreadful, so Turner will have tough sledding for a while.<br>  <br>  I like Mendenhall, but he won't get lion share of the carries, Parker will.|`|4kemNmTNaa	Turner.  He's a definite starter and quality RB2.<br>  <br>  That said, Mendenhall is going to be pretty decent and should be the goal line back in Pitts.  Lots of TDs.  Don't give up too much for Turner.

I you can keep Westbrook/Lynch, Wayne/Jennings on your team and get a top 10 QB you will be very difficult to beat. |`|2cvcJgzEaa	Yes I would. Anytime I can get a top 3 RB and still maintain a good backfield and WR core I will jump on it and this isn't going to cause much harm to your team for the upgrade you will be receiving at RB. And as Mark W said you still can trade for a better QB which I would do.

lYnkvRASaa	Boston seems to have a legitimate shot this year.  As Bob said I think they can't trade him, if Thomas gets hurt you are done.  They have to accept that the lose him for nothing at seasons end but he is too good an insurance policy to trade unless you get a decent backup back and an impact player.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I don't think so because what if Thomas goes down? The Bruins consider themselves a contender so would they want to put that on Rask (you are RIGHT...it is ONE game).   That said, Thomas and Fernandez are BOTH UFA's at season's end and it will be Manny's last season there so instead of losing him for nothing they may deal him (See: Huet last year).   Manny Fernandez a Detroit Red Wing? Why not!|`|U8HSSSswaa	Ok, you may only have seen Tuuka play once, but I'm from the Providence area, and I've seen him play multiple times, and on some days, I think he could rival Thomas for the starting spot. Fernandez was supposed to be the new starter last season, but Thomas was spectacular, so Manny does nothing now. I think the Bruins will trade him, only because he's wasting his time, and he's probably getting paid just under what Thomas is getting paid for nothing, so they'll bring in a real third string goalie and maybe a player or two for a good goalie like Fernandez.
SSHIAlK4aa	Depends on your level of cardiovascular fitness. Take it easy and progress slowly as swings will really peg the heart rate as you'll find out soon enough and always watch your form. I can tell you that you should keep a typical workout under 40 minutes. Outside of that, go nuts.    There's several 20 minute routines. You can also time yourself for swings and snatches, say ten minutes, then try to improve how many you can do in that time frame. Take rests between sets!

2d7f6636775227e6f83d1df754993208aa	Based solely on the opposing defense, Griese has to be the favorite.  But you have to look at more than just the opposing defense.<br>  <br>  Hasselbeck is getting his 2 top receivers back on the field after injury, and I get the feeling that he wants to get them back involved in the offense.  I expect Seattle to throw the ball often.<br>  <br>  Griese, on the other hand, still is without Joey Galloway, his top receiver.  And excluding the 64-pass-attempt Week 3 sling-fest he had against his former teammates in Chicago, he has only thrown for 160 yards or less and for only one TD in each of the other games this season, adding 3 INT's last week against GB.<br>  <br>  So assuming the Seattle WRs can shake off the rust early, I would go with Hasselbeck.|`|lYJMTe8waa	i would go with griese<br>  for one thing griese throws it like at least 40 times a game<br>  for another thing the bucaneers cant run the ball for their life<br>  and the final thing is the seahawks have a very solid running back|`|ABulNyoqaa	griese...<br>  denvers defence is horrible

The chance to play and win in the SuperBowl" <br>  -John Facenda (NFL FILMS)|`|9M8lEQDqaa	I believe that you are supposed to either Run or pass down the field into this marked section called an "endzone"  to get a "touchdown" OR kick the ball through this wishbone looking thing called a "goalpost" to get a "fieldgoal" and then go on "defense" to prevent the other team from scoring a "touchdown" or "fieldgoal".|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	It is for males of military age to engage in simulated war.|`|IYm9a3SUaa	You try to score more points than the other team.|`|ElHnuBplaa	so they guys can dry hump each other|`|V7R85I1Caa	to have fun|`|DUA0O1gbaa	Look the point is (Like any other sport) to score. Offense is the one who try's to score by making it to the endzone (Touchdown) and the defense, is the one trying to stop the offense by scoring. The QB or quarterback is the one who throws the ball to the Wide Recievers (The one's who catch the ball) To get a Touchdown.<br>  <br>  The Runningback is usually the fast one and he runs the ball. He's also behind the QB.|`|JUFtG1Blaa	 It's a game of  primal instincts that  gets left out of normal every day society.

rhMZTS2Kaa	Wow...even with Williams going to the Cowboys, I'm not sure I would give up Ronnie Brown for him, this year.  BTW, the TE's are inconsequential.  Unless you're talking Witten, you are lucky to get 5 rec's for 40 yds at that position.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	No no no. <br>  <br>  |`|68BrtHIKaa	Ronnie Brown is a BEAST! Do not trade him, he is one of the top three running backs!<br>  Don't do that tarde!|`|uFr2kapvaa	It would upgrade your TE spot but unless you're loaded at RB then absolutely not. Roy has very little value unless it's a deep (12 team or more) league. Then he's maybe a weak #3, plus we don't know how he'll yet fare in Dallas. Don't do the trade. Brown is the best player there and you're givin him away. Oh...Find a new Te on the wavier wire |`|TqGIx80Uaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  If you're gonna trade him, because you do have depth at RB, you can get a better deal. Try for a top reciever.|`|Rdw8RyFraa	no way...not even close.  I would take davis over clark, even with his bad start.|`|8wowXa4Vaa	If you have depth at RB...YES.  Davis is garbage so Clark would be a decent upgrade.  Roy Williams will be somewhat similar to what he's been so far.  So if thats an upgrade over your current WR's then go for. 
J9sVBnGCaa	It's pretty even, in my opinion.  Therefore if your team is doing well, don't trade.  But if you are not near the top of the pack, pull the trigger.<br>  <br>  Jones overall is a better option than McClain because he's a full time back and McClain is a #2.  Plus, he carried just 2 times last week.<br>  <br>  Henderson is nowhere near as good an option as Johnson, even with Kitna being out for the season.  Since the Lions traded Roy Williams, and they will be behind EVERY game, Johnson will get a lot of balls thrown his way.<br>  <br>  Edwards will have much better stats than Collins, but if he's your #2 QB, then it doesn't really matter.<br>  <br>  It's still pretty even, but if you don't plan to use Edwards much, then you probably should not do the trade.|`|4cda3fbcf47a67dc357a025a36e01e20aa	no that would be a stupid trade with calvin johnson being the number one reciever now he is going to get more passes thrown to him and kerry collins is better then trent edwards and leron mcClain is doing good this year|`|rqdldayQaa	I wouldn't do it.C.Johnson is one of the top WR's.And L.McClain get a lot of goalline.<br>  <br>  T.Jones is a great player,but favre loves throwing the ball alot.And N.O has to many recievers<br>  
9NDL5YQJaa	Yep.  You get a decent running back and QB.  Romo will be out for 2-3 more weeks and probably be a little shaky when he comes back.  Dallas also might be firing Wade Phillips soon.
n2O0NwR6aa	There's a girl on my daughter's squad who wants to quit.  Similar situation to yours... it's a lot more work than she anticipated, and it's taking time away from other things she'd rather be doing.  She tells my daughter all the time that she really wants to quit.<br>  <br>  Now, my daughter is friends with this girl, and she wants her to be happy.  From a personal standpoint, she wouldn't care if this girl quit.  It would actually make practices more pleasant, because she's constantly complaining and the other girls are starting to find it irritating.  However...<br>  <br>  If she quits now, it will mess up things for the entire squad.  They'll have to rearrange all the stunts and formations that they've been working so hard on. And since her stunt group will be one person short, that means the rest of those girls won't be able to stunt at all.   Plus, it's too late to replace her.  If she had quit earlier - or not tried out at all - someone else could've had her spot. Someone who really, really wanted to make it.<br>  <br>  The thing is, if she quits now, a lot of people will have a pretty low opinion of her; the other cheerleaders (because she left them short handed), and the other girls who tried out and didn't make it (because she needlessly took a spot that could've gone to one of them).  And believe me... no one is going to think, "Well, she quit because cheer just wasn't her thing, so that's okay."  In everyone else's eyes, she'll be quitting because she's lazy and selfish and a quitter and would rather hang out with her friends than go to practice.  And that's the reputation she'll have among her peers, coaches, teachers, etc.<br>  <br>  For those reasons, my daughter has been trying to convince her friend to stick it out until the end of the season - and then just not try out next year.  And that's the advice I'm going to give you.  If you can bear it, try to stick it out a while longer.  The year will be over before you know it, and next year you can do what you want.  If it's really and truly making your life miserable, though, then maybe you ought to quit now.  But just keep in mind what kind of impression it will make, and think carefully about whether or not it will bother you having that kind of reputation.|`|HhECyibGaa	Be happy.  Life is too short to put yourself through that mess.

Its not because ur giving up on it, too you it just isnt fun anymore. And if they tease u about it, get in there fake *** faces and be creative. lol.<br>  <br>  My situation is very similiar.

ce325e49471ac8c71bad66293f8536f5aa	No question about it Slaton is a must start.  As for the other 1, I would go with Mcgahee.  Baltimores defense is A LOT better than Clevelands.  Plus Leron Mclain (Mcgahees back up) hasnt been getting many touches. Mcgahee had the goaline TD last week. Slaton and Mcgahee is a great 1,2 punch.|`|66392029db614f3698d5afba31fa121faa	McGahee, definitely.  The other two are a toss up.  Baltimore and Minnesota have a top defense against the run with each team giving up less than 100 yds/game on the ground.  Although McGehee has been somewhat inconsistent, I would still stick with him this week.|`|ACMsjE4Gaa	Steve Slaton and Willis Mcgahee|`|NKl9NeeFaa	Slaton and mcgahee<br>  Bal still no1 vs run, and slaton gets rec yards too, tough matchups though|`|NeYFiGmRaa	Lewis and Slaton.

ce325e49471ac8c71bad66293f8536f5aa	Id say you pretty much have to start Edwards.  Cleveland is gonna try and start out running, with no success.  Then it is going to be pass, pass, pass which is good for Braylon.  Id go with Walter just because hes going agaisnt a weaker pass defenese and has a QB who, um, isnt AS terrible as Brad Johnson.  Edwards and Walter.|`|NKl9NeeFaa	Id say water and edwards, Johnson hasnt shown anything and giants D isnt gonna give him time|`|B5xrYsuxaa	braylon and walter, the cowboys wont get anything done this weekend, brad johnson is a sad sad case|`|ACMsjE4Gaa	if it is 2 of them i would start roy williams and kevin walters|`|H7vXCNepaa	Wow, garbage. . . I would say Walter only because they have a QB who is do something. Walter is also getting a lot of looks from Schaub and since the Vikings run D is stellar (coming off a bye), the Texans will be looking to air it out. Put it Edwards cuz the Ravens are missing a couple DB's.|`|JufaTgT9aa	Don't consider Williams unless he puts up some numbers.  He had a TD last week but really isn't part of the offense yet.  Edwards is a great receiver having a terrible year.  Walter is hit / miss but goes against a Viking defense that has been suspect.  It's close, but I would start Walter.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NeYFiGmRaa	Walter's got the best matchup.  Roy really came on last weekend, and the Cowboys will probably be playing catch up.  Who knows if Edwards shows up.<br>  <br>  I'd go with Walter and Roy.
TRCxzEDUaa	Housh for sure Walters been having a good year but you have to go with ur top reciver here|`|1326cb00e49de27af7fc131cb4f406dfaa	housh is a great reciever, but is struggling.  If he can ever break out of this slump, it will be this week.  Play him|`|xO2fDqklaa	Houshmanzadeh is a #1 WR. You play them in every game unless they are injured.   Minnesota does have a decent DEF. I think Housh will get close to 100yd and 1 td|`|NtaGl6M6aa	Housh all the way. Even with the terrible offense T.J. is the main receiver.  Because the depends upon him, he will have more points. |`|TTcFszV5aa	Definitely Housh.

Edwards has been having a rough year and I think Avery's game last week may have been a fluke.  I don't question that he's good, but as a rookie I wouldn't expect to see that two weeks in a row.<br>  <br>  You have a lot of wideouts on your team.|`|ce325e49471ac8c71bad66293f8536f5aa	Gotta go Johnson, Jennings, and Jackson.  In that order.  Jennings has a tough matchup but has proven that doesnt matter most of the time.  Johnson is a beast against good pass D's, Minnesota is far from that.  Same argument with DeSean Jackson.  He also has little competion other than Brian Westbrook, with Curtis still not 100%, same with Reggie for Philly.  Johnson, Jennings, and Jackson.  |`|O8CmT28Naa	ANDRE,GREG,AVERY

AA12111637	Little League is about having FUN while kids learn how to field and bat. Our little league has great coaches 2 of them played professionally. I think you need to suck it up and let them have fun.|`|7ffd97a861991bd401797f85fa16c58daa	While that may be the case in some leagues, I would not say it's the case across the board.  Our local Little League has a minor league and major league.  To play on a major league team, the kids have to be drafted after league-wide tryouts.  So if a kid is just playing for fun, getting some experience, and learning the game, minor league is a great place for them without nearly as much pressure.  For the kids who step up the competition a notch, major league is very competitive, with teams routinely having the same coaches year after year. And they're good coaches too -- coaches who'll bench their best player if they skip practice or don't hustle and put it all out there for the team.  They're building responsible young men (and women) and it shows in the pride these kids take in wearing their uniforms and how reverent they are toward the annual city-wide tourney and all-star selection.  Is Little League lame?  Not in my neck of the woods!|`|bdb6185bb2e68edd0b9d964754a72356aa	I agree.
AA11314617	There are a few.  Click on the link below.|`|92ca73d3c8734df4015c909c8df19579aa	Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Paul Tucket|`|AA10460539	The Tri-City Valley Cats are a minor league baseball team based in Troy, New York. (The tri-cities are comprised of Albany, Schenectady and Troy, which make up New York State's Capital District.) The team, which plays in the New York - Penn League (NYPL), is the short-season Class A affiliate of the Houston Astros Major League Baseball club.|`|AA11564832	The Oneonta Tigers (short-season A afiliate of the Detroit Tigers) are 80 miles away in Oneonta. The Tri-City ValleyCats (short-season A afiliate of the Houston Astros) are right outside Albany in Troy. The Hudson Valley Renegades (short-season afiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays) are 80 miles away in Wappingers Falls.
AA12309555	Yeah I figured that it would start early as hell. I hate how they don't even bother to list the times of when these events are going to happen, you always have to research all over the internet to somehow discover the time of a tennis match.     A lot of these tennis sites give you all the information BUT the time of the match, its such an obvious flaw, I wonder when they will make it easier for audiences abroad to watch their favorite tennis matches.  I guess I am staying up all night to watch this at 3 am, then there's the Super Bowl in the evening, haha, should be an interesting Sunday.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	That depends...where in the US are you? The match starts @:    12.30am PST  1.30am Mountain  2.30am Central  3.30am EST|`|lldX3uwcaa	the match will be broadcast on ESPN 2 beginning at 3:30 EST on Sunday morning.
fEWhwumZaa	Lets face it, we're always in a state of panic :P  It just shows less when we can actually win a game.|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	if by panic u mean rolling in the faeces of man utd,    then yes.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Unfortunately Man U will win again.  Premiere league football is less and less fun.|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	well really, its not over yet despite what some might say!!  my boys seem to like living under pressure so don't write them off yet.|`|ymdelC6Yaa	It's not over yet.  If we beat Chelsea tomorrow and you lot in March everything can change.  That is, of course, providing we play like we know we can against the lesser teams in the league.  (no offence intended to the lesser teams)|`|RqkITQUiaa	no not yet|`|XtUwTozvaa	still there|`|xPVvjFX7aa	no its not liverpool its just there maneger that is under pressure. i think it was what Furgerson said about liverpool that scared him and made him panic|`|kpoPY3ZHaa	Yes.  Chelsea will take the title. Just wait a little.
p8lB73rdaa	Well if that's the case Rafa is a great actor 'coz he was singing Keane's praises when he arrived at Anfield .  I have a funny feeling that Keane will be playing for Liverpool long after Rafa is gone !    BTW , You were spot on dR .|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	didn't know it from day one but it does explain why Rafa wants control of buying players, i mean everyone is on his back when things aren't going well so if his going to carry the blame he should also get to make the choices. kinda the point of being the manager isn't it.|`|RqkITQUiaa	from day one
jj4ZbtrCaa	it should be mo williams but he got ripped off.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Yes..  It is a bench player in the all-star game..  They are picked by the coaches...|`|5b3bc75908f8e6f307db37d7e1944faaaa	yeah but they play usually a lil less time in the all star game    depends on the coach and who he likes|`|5BQM1hTTaa	They are the bench players who are picked by the conference coaches.  And usually they have to come from a team with a winning record.|`|5gfZgPLsaa	Backup in case someone gets hurt|`|V03f8tmMaa	Yes what do u think|`|uQUraKYeaa	It is gas you store in the extra tank on your airplane.
4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Yeah it was a little sad to see matt turning heel on jeff but think of the positive as a heel he might get some pushes he needs and turns into a true main eventer. You gotta admit he did a great promo on smackdown. One day they'll unite again and i hope they seriously wrestle against edge and christian.|`|ikyij2g3aa	It was shocking and that's why I love WWE where anything can happen and also I think the hardy storyline will be great which will make both wrestlers possibly better like on the mic.|`|bagXMU7oaa	I think it stinks and kind of sad but a great storyline., I was so sad when he said there is no more The Hardyz. And what he said about the fans and stuff was so true though.|`|7ImGw976aa	A nice twist, was half expecting Christian but thought it could be Matt as well so not so shocked.  I liked Matt's acting on Smackdown, he had it down well, right down to an evil glint in the eye and dark facial expressions.|`|c0b843402c3ee206a8f4d1dc3949a130aa	I Ddunt Cry But I Was Indeed Shocked Wen It Happened...  But Jeff Is Gnna Kiick Hiis A$$ Neways Sooo...  But It Was Comin!!!|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	it was predictable.... not suprising. i saw it coming a mile away.    it makes a great story i guess|`|AA12144638	I think Jeff is going to get Matt for doing this to him but I think ll,ll be a great Story line|`|yb67y0AWaa	i was happy when i saw matt came out to help but when he hit him wit the chair ma mouth drop seriously drop open for like 10mins then tears started coming down my eyes so i felt really bad n i was mad at matt fr wat he did but i got over it cuz they still friend n brother honesty i think matt did a great job on sd but i was still mad|`|VENyKvgaaa	same i think soon there will be a match when the new la famila Matt Hardy Christan Cage edge Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder Chavo Guerrero and face Jeff Hardy and five partners of his choosing which turns out to be triple h the great khali undertaker Hurricane Helms and r-truth|`|H7jURVleaa	Loved it, its going to be exciting to follow.|`|iaLe5Lnlaa	It's sad for brothers should stick close by each other. I couldn't believe it either when I saw it. Instead of sticking by Jeff Matt deserted him maybe when he needed him the most. You cant trust anyone these days I guess.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The story line is not going to be pushed over the McMahon Family feud with RKO, so I think it's a good idea on paper that is never going to get the play on TV (or house shows) it should have warranted. And Matt comes across like Bill Goldberg when he briefly turned heel....he looks uncomfortable and it's just a real bad fit at this point in his career.|`|D8jcgdcpaa	I loved it|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I think it's a great storyline. They both needed something like this. Take the fact that Christian will be returning soon and throw in Edge and this might be one of the best storylines in a long time.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	The modern day Bret vs Owen feud. I like it. Matt is much better suited for a heel role, as his face run was very stale|`|Gr7My8FTaa	its the storyline they are still brothers
L77OlY1naa	If he wins on Sunday then yes....if he doesn't its a long shot look at the qbs that are still not in|`|a6EndAPiaa	No the Hall of Fame is for players with great careers.  Warner has had 3 very very good seasons and the rest have been average at best.  He has had 3 seasons in which he was benched for over 1/2 the season and another when he was benched for 6 out of 16 games.  All in the middle of his career.  I am sorry but someone who gets benched in the middle of his career does not belong in the Hall of Fame.    No matter how much people love Kurt's story he does not belong in the Hall of Fame.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	yes|`|5BQM1hTTaa	If he wins this Sunday, my answer is a definate yes.  If he doesn't I still think yes.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	Super Bowl champion, NFL MVP, led two teams to the Super Bowl - yeah I think he deserves it|`|F65Km3Coaa	yep|`|4llU5Oaoaa	ya|`|CTEQMXFwaa	Definitely|`|IWRjbQ1Xaa	if cards win super bowl : yes 5-6 years after he retires (requirement is 5 yearsd afterwards is soonest)    if cards lose : not as likely if they would win, but i say he gets in 10 years after he's out of the NFL|`|5gfZgPLsaa	Of course he should!|`|Bcm0iGuhaa	If he has one more good season in his career I believe he can make it to the HOF.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	lmao...no    If he wins the SB he'll probably get in...but based on  's alone...no, he shouldn't.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	If he wins tomorrow, he is a 100% lock for the HOF. If he losses, he has probably a 60% chance unless he puts together another couple of good years.|`|xCvIyb67aa	He defiantly should, he has been one of the elite quarterbacks in the NFL for years.

fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	football is a sunday event but i can agree with you-i already know im going to have a rough day monday and if the steelers win it will be even rougher(if they win gotta drink more to celebrate right? lol) but its only one day to feel like s**t while working,so its worth it ;)    ok they won and im still drinkin lol-gonna be a rough one tomorrow :)      and this city is wearing 6 rings right now!!!!!!!!!!!!! im glad for the steelers-they just made nfl history :)|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Nope...tradition...    So they should change tradition due to your drinking habits?    Not everyone will be having a hangover...|`|5VHEcfp2aa	Ya I think it would be but football on Sunday is just tradition and I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't be happy if the super bowl was not played on Sunday|`|bFI4ZAtjaa	yeah - so that everyone around the world can watch. I agree -|`|SKXNeL8paa	no it should be on sundays that is the best day and if you have drinking prombles get help so you can watch the super bowl on sundays don't get wasted you dumb butt retard and it is tradition on sundays|`|A7kLBcoOaa	it whould be better on my head monday|`|a6EndAPiaa	No it would not.  Pro Football is played (mainly) on Sundays.  If you do not want a hang-over then do not drink so much :D      PS    I have six fingers on my right hand.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	dont get wasted then?|`|5BQM1hTTaa	No.  Its better on Sunday.  It wouldn't be the same.|`|r4J2sPHzaa	why play it saturday everyone knows saturday is party nights so there audience would be out chilling and everyone would be home on a sunday night due to the fact they have to work the next day.but that's just how i see it so what do you think|`|6tGYe5roaa	It just fits on Sunday. Football is generally played on Sundays. Either just suck it up and deal with the hangover or don't drink at all.  :)
xfRwel49aa	Yeah it's common probably because you are not very good.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	Yes it is common.|`|V03f8tmMaa	Not that i know of|`|ovBNkYtpaa	/ /)  --/-/  -/-/  --//'--'/`?_  -/'/--/-/--/\  --('(- ~/'--')  \-'--/  -'\'_-?  \--(
a6EndAPiaa	No Kurt it is not.  It is nice to hear that someone else agrees.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	How many SB rings? Thats a very important part.    Those stats alone aren't good enough to make the HOF.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Not sure except for one thing:    You seem to have skewed these stats to make it look as bad as possible for the guy you are talking about. What if he won the Super Bowl four times in those other four years?    Terry Bradshaw had some bad years, and even lost his starting job a couple of times. Look where he is now!|`|5BQM1hTTaa	I dont think it'll qualify.|`|jDOv2TSeaa	How about this, is this Hall of Fame worthy? For 5 consecutive seasons I had a 59% completion percentage. I averaged 19.8 touchdowns and 17.2 interceptions, and during those five consecutive seasons I had a combined passer efficiency rating of 78.9.     Is that HOF worthy? No? Congratulations. You've just thrown Jim Kelly out of the NFL Hall of Fame.    "Jim Kelly was 101-59 as a starter". Okay...so regular season wins is a legitimate QB statistic, but Super Bowl wins isn't?|`|F65Km3Coaa	another clueless football fan  warner is in the HOF  it is a lock|`|Iv8kTVqtaa	No, that would be for the Hall of OK, unless you add three superbowls, one superbowl win, one superbowl MVP, and his stats the other four years. (If you mean Warner).|`|p0jWdSsAaa	No way definitely not a hall of fame career in my book. Your win/loss record needs to be above .500. Not enough touchdowns too many Int's for that length of a career and the completion % should have been higher.
AA10907739	I just thought that Cleveland fans would find the whole "Baltimore Hates Indy" thing interesting, since if you scratch the Ravens logo too hard you'll reveal an orange helmet with a white stripe underneath.|`|T2VrLLilaa	The Brownies never will be satisfied until they win the Superbowl even then they will be miserable|`|c8c089a122bbf8d578e9958ac142d8cfaa	Cleveland fans will never be happy.|`|dINueFJQaa	i'm not quite sure about it but I would say yes because Indianapolis is more local to them

iOICjcZcaa	I like John Cena. I think he cuts a hell of a promo and he definately knows how to wrestle. People give him such crap about his wrestling but what they don't realize is that WWE waters down his moveset. He's got a very wide moveset and he definately knows how to wrestle. WWE just tells him what to do. The Five Knuckle Shuffle has gained SO much money for the WWE through merchandise that it's kind of like he has do that move every match.    People give him that "Superman" gimmick that he always beats everyone, but they don't give Triple H any crap for how he constantly destroys everyone. Even last night when he beat Khali with ONE Pedigree. Man, that pissed me off.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	He was better in OVW than he's been in the WWE. The Superman gimmick fails to show his true talent.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	HE ******* SUCKS!    CENA CANT WRESTLE!!|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	good wrestler great mike skills and overall talented could be better but still good|`|PA5uMDpdaa	He rocks!!! second best wrestler next to triple H|`|TWQNYhVVaa	He's not the worst,but compared to HBK,RKO,Edge,etc. He isn't worth much,good entertainer,not so great wrestler..he sells t shirts and gets people watching..|`|zhXFtgPqaa	Overall I like John Cena. He has a great work ethic; he is dedicated to the business and represents the WWE well.     Opinions are like noses, everyone has one, so people are going to not like him for certain reasons. One of the main ones being that he "can't wrestle", well sure Cena isn't a Stu Hart Dungeon graduate, but it's not like he's some random guy off the street.    Cena actually does have a pretty good move set; it's just that we don't see him switch it up enough. Cena has been apart of many great pure wrestling matches during his career.     He's great for the business, he sells tickets, and he has a huge fan base of people of all ages, not just 8 year olds and teenage girls. He's a cool person, that has a lot of charisma and you can tell by seeing his work on and off screen that he is just a genuinely great guy.    He's not my favorite wrestler, but I do like him however. I respect him for all he does and despite all the criticismm that surrounds him, he still puts forth his all and works hard.|`|kCbDkQzGaa	He's very dedicated and passionate about his career.  He definitely sets a positive example to many people....However, as a wrestler he is good but not great.  When he began to develop his character, it didn't help him at all that at the same time Rapper Eminem was making a name for himself as the top notch top rated Rapper (White Rapper).  Cena's was starting to portray the White Rapper character from the hood and that didn't sit to well with me.  He came off as a "Wannabe".  Cena also lacks Charisma.  Being one of the top Wrestlers in the WWE today, he is lacking in the "Get everyone's attention" department (thanks to Hogan and the Rock for setting the standard)  Many of the audience are a bit confused, some people boo him, and some people love him, there really is no "in between" with the fans. Personally, I think he's a good guy, but I wouldn't run up to him for an autograph.|`|rzuXnXIMaa	WTH...... What R U Sayin' ???????  "He's not a Good Wrestler" If   it so...... He shouldn't B The World Champio. I mean He has Defeated Every Big Star IN the WWE 2DAY.......... He is Great..........

I respect his love and desire for wrestling and seems like a hard worker. People might not respect his wrestling ability or him being champion again and again but i gotta say you have to respect how much he works for this business.|`|Be6HpTuoaa	i thik John Cena's a role model, i look up to him because he doesn't back down and never quits. He is a great guy and sets a good example for people. He works his *** of to entertain the fans and the thanks he gets is getting booed by people saying U Can't Wrestle, Cena Sucks. His gimmick is a huge influence on his moveset. He cut's great promos. He sells merchandise but it's not his fault that people have to buy them. Personnaly, i respect every single wrestler for working there *** of and put their bodies onthe line just to give us a good show. John Cena is WWE  and he is awsome.|`|H7jURVleaa	Agree with Musicman, he's very passionate, but he will never live up to the high expectations set for him to be like Hogan or The Rock far as just appealing to the masses.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Good guy, poeple need to leave him alone, he's working hard for these fans

4iGSmzLLaa	I don't see them splitting Miz and Morrison up yet. I think that they're going to carry the "greatest tag team" gig for a while. Morrison is absolutely main event material, but they can't afford to lose him in the tag team division just yet.  I have high hopes for MVP in MitB. From the looks of things, they're getting him back on his game and he's declared his intentions for the US Championship. A win at WM 25 is just what the doctor ordered for MVP. I could also see Evan Bourne making a return, winning MitB, and challenging Swagger for the ECW Championship, couning on the fact that he still has it come WM.|`|n55Vb81Faa	Shelton Benjamin! also morrison has a big chance to make it|`|3icTrKLLaa	Morrison is plenty capable of being a main eventer! I just don't think he is going to win it yet. I could see MVP winning it or somebody like Christian coming in and winning it if he returns in time.    John Morrison won't be a main eventer for a couple of years yet.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	Morrison is not capable of being a Main Eventer|`|bagXMU7oaa	My picks:    1) Evan Bourne: If he won it would kind of remind me of CM punks win.    2) Rey Mysterio: This would be cool, him walking around with the suitcase.    3) Jericho: This guy has a real good chance of winning since he's not going to wrestle that dude anymore it was annouced earlier.    4) Jeff: if he isn't in a match with Matt or in a championship match at Mania.|`|8DIkez2uaa	They won't split up Miz and Morrison yet. They are the only good tag team right now (outside of the ring), and are carrying the tag team division. They just simply haven't been around long enough.    But to answer your question.    I think MVP will win it. If he is even in the match and not the US title match. But if he's not, I say Rey, he could use a boost back into the main event.|`|9NRyeif9aa	John Morrison  The Miz  Rey Mysterio - Possible Winner too  The Brian Kendrick  MVP - Winner  Finlay  R-Truth  Kofi Kingston|`|qVDY1hm5aa	John Morrison or MVP. John Morrison has enough credibility and talent to be elevated into main event status. I would much prefer to see Miz & Morrison stay together as the tag team division in WWE right now, is basically dead. With that being said, if Morrison doesn't win it, MVP will. This guy deserves after proving to be loyal to the company afer a long losing streak, he should be boosted up the card and be given a mega push. A dark horse would be Chris Jericho. If he does not wrestle Mickey Rourke at WM 25, I mHopehe participates in MiTB. After all, he was the one who came up with the idea.|`|ikyij2g3aa	If Chris Jericho isn't busy with any match at WM 25 then I think he could win it because he is one of the greatest in a ladder match and he is an amazing athlete.|`|8XOoNpU7aa	I reckon these people will be in the Money in the Bank    John Morrison (Great Wrestler and definitely has charisma)  Shelton Benjamin( How can you have a ladder match without him)  Rey Mysterio (Great High flyer one of the best in WWE)  Kane (Powerhouse but can pull of great moves)  Kofi Kingston (Will give him a great boost)  Christian/ Chris Jericho (Good Wrestler deserve a push)  Mr. Kennedy (Will give him a push)  R-truth (Can pull off great moves)    I can see Miz and Morrison splitting up aswell  I think Morrison has been in a tag team for too long now
qVDY1hm5aa	I can see it really going far, beyond WM 25. I think a match a TLC Match at WM 25, would be awesome. Changing Matt Hardy's name is a great idea since he cut that promo on SD!. Good thinking.|`|bagXMU7oaa	1) I don't see BOTH going in because there are only two spots because there is a good chance Kozlov is going in. Maybe one on one at No Way Out.    2) If he changes his name that would suck but that would give him really big heat.|`|91hw0Vnwaa	Bankrupt hopefuly...|`|AA12144638	oh let them have a feud fo awhile then they will moved on|`|3icTrKLLaa	They should have a one on one match at no way out but have it somehow end in a double count out or double DQ. This would lead to a great match at Mania (I'll be there so i'm keeping my fingers crossed). I could see Matt winning at Mania and seriously injuring Jeff (kafaybe). A couple months later, say Judgement Day or Night of Champions Jeff comes back to get revenge on Matt for injuring him at WrestleMania. Jeff brings in a special "guest" to help him, leading to Christian's return. Edge, who has lost the WWE title by then, then sides with Matt and we have a series of classic tag team matches once again. They could make this potentially great feud last a long time if they do it right.|`|Gr7My8FTaa	he would probably just take out the hardy part of his name|`|41WXZPnCaa	MM No    Matt Hardy Will Still Being Matt Hardy     But They Are Gonna Wrestle For A Place In The Chamber|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	They Should go to Wrestlemania with a TLC match|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	1) No    2) Maybe    But I think at Wrestlemania it will be Matt Hardy and Edge vs. Jeff Hardy and Christian|`|NNn84vTCaa	1) Yes, but Matt winning. That way, Matt can drop it at Wrestlemania 25, when Matt goes against Jeff for the WWE title. Then, both would have month and a half reigns, and Jeff would win the WWE title, or something like that.    2) No, Matt shouldn't change his name. He is Matt Hardy. This is hard to explain, but he is making a name for himself, changing his name would just be silly and taking it too far. It would make Matt look childish, so basically, he IS going to be Matt Hardy, not Jeffs older brother, not the over-shadowed one of the Hardys, not half of the Hardy boys, but MATT HARDY.|`|ikyij2g3aa	no 1 agreed and 2 that would be funny and they should make the fued with good extreme matches and at the last match it could be a loser leaves brand match at WM 25.

I've heard plenty:    Retire at this WM  Retire at WM when he hits 20-0  Just signed a three year contract  Leaving to become a Realtor  Just signed a five year contact  He's undecided  Plans on doing both reality and wrestling     ...honestly, wrestlers usually announce when they plan on retiring so until I hear it out of his mouth, he's still a wrestler.

07898cb914f82e14973d2936856f3e34aa	Baseball is a game played with a bat, ball and glove. The fundamentals of the game involve throwing the ball, hitting the ball, and catching the ball. Of course, the execution of these three tasks is more challenging than it sounds, and it is that challenge that compels baseball players to play the game.Unlike most games, a running clock does not limit the length of a baseball game. The two competing teams play over a period of innings, which are subdivided into halves. Professional and college games are generally nine innings long. During the first half of each inning, the visiting team bats and attempts to score points, called runs, while the home team players take their respective defensive positions in the field. The defense's goal is to get the offensive team's players "out" in a variety of ways. After three outs are recorded, the teams switch -- the offensive team moves to defense, and the defensive team moves to offense. The batting team sends one player at a time to try and hit the ball. The engine of the sport is composed of two players -- the pitcher and the batter. All of the action in a baseball game revolves around these two combatants. The pitcher stands on a raised mound of dirt, called the pitcher's mound, which is 60 feet 6 inches (18.4 meters) from home plate in Major League Baseball. The batter stands on either side of the home base, called "the plate," holding a bat and facing the pitcher. To set the game in motion, the pitcher attempts to throw the ball past the batter into the catcher's glove or make the batter hit the ball to put it in play. As the ball is put in play, the eight fielders try to catch it or throw out the batter (more on this later) so he can't get on base and ultimately score a point (a run). The batter's goal is to put the ball in play so that the eight fielders can't catch the ball or throw it to another fielder to record an out. Even the best batters in Major League Baseball today get a hit only about 38 percent of the time at best. Most players only get a hit 25 percent of the time. Why are such poor numbers considered successful, or at least adequate? It is because hitting a small sphere moving at 90+ miles per hour (145+ kph) with a round stick is the hardest thing to do in sports?   According to Robert Adair, author of The Physics of Baseball, a baseball thrown at 95 mph (153 kph) reaches home plate in 0.4 seconds. In that split second, a batter must determine where the ball is and where it will be when it reaches home plate. He then must swing the bat so that it connects with the ball at the exact moment the ball reaches home plate. The task of hitting a ball is made even more difficult because pitchers have developed special pitches to deceive batters. There are changeup pitches, which is when the pitch appears to be faster than it is. A curveball is, as it sounds, a ball that curves in toward or away from the batter. A third deceptive pitch is the slider that comes in like a straight fastball, but then suddenly drops down a few inches. All of these factors combine to make hitting the ball a very difficult task.On the offensive side of the game, there are two types of players -- the hitter and the base runner. Once the hitter makes contact with the ball and gets a hit, he becomes a base runner and must safely reach each base in succession. The ultimate goal of each offensive player is to make his way around the bases and cross home plate, thereby scoring a run. When a hitter is at the plate, he is considered to be at bat. During an at bat, the pitcher of the opposing team throws the ball to the catcher, and the hitter tries to hit the ball with the bat before it reaches the catcher. Each throw is called a pitch. A pitch can be either a ball or a strike. (The umpire is the judge of whether a pitch is a ball or a strike.)   A ball is a pitch that is out of the strike zone, which is an imaginary rectangular box that typically runs the width of the plate and from the hitter's chest to his knees. A strike is a ball that goes through the strike zone and is not hit by the hitter. A strike can be a ball outside of the strike zone if the hitter swings and misses. If a player hits a ball that goes into foul territory and is not caught by a fielder before it touches the ground, it is also counted as a strike -- except when the batter already has two strikes. A batter with two strikes can hit the ball into foul territory indefinitely without striking out. However, a ball caught in foul territory is scored an out. During an at bat, a hitter may do one of several actions, including:  Walk - When the pitcher throws four balls before throwing three strikes, the hitter gets a free base. Hit by pitch - A hitter that is struck with a pitch is awarded first base. Single - The hitter hits the ball into play far enough to get to first base. Double - The hitter hits the ball into play far enough to get to second base.   Triple - The hitter hits the ball into play far enough to get to third base. Home run - The hitter hits the ball over the outfield wall between the foul poles and is awarded a free trip around the bases, or the hitter hits the ball far enough that he or she has time to run all the bases. The hitter must run around the bases and touch home plate for the home run to count.   Fielder's choice - A hitter makes contact with the ball, but only reaches base because a fielder chose to throw out another runner. Error - A hitter makes contact with the ball and only reaches base because a fielder misplays the ball.   A runner must go around the bases in order, starting with first base. He then goes to second, third, and finally home. A base runner can advance in one of several ways. He can be advanced by another player's hit or by a hitter being walked, or he can steal a base. To steal a base, the runner starts running from one base to another before the at-bat player gets a hit or a walk, and makes it to the base without getting tagged o|`|AA10704364	My husband says:  Get 2 or 3 top notch pitchers and you will be a winner.|`|ed481c8a6a38d41a0999eb7bbf6f3227aa	I just can't believe that Connie girl spent that much time explaining baseball to an idiot|`|e72ec686967b8e9235dc83078793d715aa	there really is not enough space here to explain all the rules of baseball.|`|AA11805087	Hi,   Please do your own homework.

8DIkez2uaa	I'll give it a 6, it's good for what it is, but we're talking about WM 25, what's supposed to be the biggest WM of all time. Some of your matches just wouldn't work.    MitB: Most of these guys are good, I originally predicted most of them. But Evan Bourne will not be in it, sorry.    Tag Team. Alright, Cryme Tyme still isn't big enough yet to have a big match at WM 25. Look for them in the dark match.    US Title. I like it, but I think Truth will be in the MitB seeing as he's a 2x TNA Champ. And after the promo MVP gave, I think we'll be seeing MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin.    Special Match. On Larry King, Rourke said he wouldn't wrestle Jericho, which would be a smart move because it would be a terrible match. But he will be involved with Jericho's match, either the special ref, or special enforcer like Mike Tyson was in SCSA vs. HBK.  I'm really pulling fr Jericho vs. Stone Cold, and it's not impossible either. In an interview with the sun last year, Stone Cold said he may be up for it.    Divas battle royal, like I've said, WM 25. There gonnas have a Women's title match. Probably Beth vs. Melina, wish it was Beth vs. Victoria though, that would've been epic for a divas match.    Taker vs. Kozlov. Can I say most predictable match in WM history? We know Taker will win so at least give him a good opponent like HBK who will help make it a good match. Plus, Kozlov hasn't been around long enough and isn't in Taker's (Wrestlemania) league. I still predict HBK vs. Taker now that everyone else thinks HBK will face JBL.    WWE title, I hate HHH, I'm starting to hate Edge but at least he's a heel. Big Show won't win, this actually may happen, but I don't like it.    ECW title. Kane won't go after it, Henry won't have it. I say Finlay vs. Tommy, since Finlay will be carrying ECW now that Matt's gone.    JBL vs. HBK. They'll fight at No Way Out, and like I said, HBK vs. Taker (C'mon, think about it. It's the biggest WM ever). I think JBL vs. Kane maybe.    Hardy vs. Hardy. Probably gonna happen, it'll be big. I would've prefered Edge vs. Christian vs. matt vs. Jeff, but still look for Christian to be involved with those two.    WHC. I hate it since we've seen it so many times before, it was supposed to be Batista vs. Cena, which would've been better since we've only seen it once before. But it looks like this will be it.    I know I sound like a broken record, but it's Wrestlemania 25. I don't know if that means anything to you, but it means a lot to other people. And this simply isn't as epic as it should be.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I was with you up until I read Cena and Orton again. I'm tired of seeing them wrestle, it's stale.    And to have Jericho, a future legend, wrestle a hollywood wanna be is a disgrace.    How about adding Jericho into the Cena and Orton match, make it a triple threat match.    I'm not downing your card, it's pretty good.|`|zMps0L5daa	On A Scale Between 1-10, I Give It A 6. Some Are Really Good, But Some Of Them Could Never Happen. Kane Will Not Go For The ECW Champion.

Idk about Umaga against R Truth though.  World Tag Team Championship match seems a little boring.  Special Match also.  Divas Battle Royal seems good lol.  Taker vs Kozlov is alright  WWE Championship match is great.  Extreme Rules match also awesome  ECW Championship match is alright  Bull Rope would be good  Heavyweight Championship - Classic    Overall its a 8/10|`|H7jURVleaa	There's to many matches, so if you would scrap the tag match, and put Morrison and Miz in MITB could be a really good card.

You can totally tell that not only Rafa respects him a lot, Fed also has a great deal of respect for Rafa himself, but the day I see either of them letting the other win...nah, just won't happen.

Vamoooooooooos Rafa!!!!!!!|`|k3y2ViUyaa	im not agree wid you....dis is d first time nadal reach d final for aussie open so there is no way he gonna let federer win as he really2 work so hard to get to the final..gosh dat 5 hours match is really2 incredible...nadal need to win dis grand slam so dat he will b tie wid federer...federer had never won french open rite??and if nadal won dis game,he will only be left wid one rand slam to win which is d US open...so,it will b interesting to see who's gona complete d grand slam first...whether nadal or federer...my pick is nadal......however,im concern bout nadal as he might b feeling tired and fatigue in d final.....federer have 2 days to rest while nadal only have 1...not only dat,nadal needed 5 hours before making it to the final,which means he loss so much energy alredy........so,if nadal lose in d final,it wasnt becuz he let federer to win but simply becoz he is tired...tQ|`|EzSMKnG9aa	Listen to me....  in any where, any time or any planet, no one can give away a tennis match. Even if a player is up 6-0, 5-0 in a match, he/he doesn't feel sorry for the opponent and start to give games away. In tennis or any other sport, there's no pitty....    Besides, even if Rafa is such a great player, he has to prove that he can win a hard court major.    If Nadal liked Federer so much and would give him a tennis match, then why didn't he give Federer the Finals in Roland Garros and Wimbledon last year????    Be reasonable man...|`|AA12034105	No way !!  Rafa would never ever let anyone win a match :O !!  He is gonna play his heart out tomorrow and he's gonna be rewarded with the title ;-) !! x|`|OeJ1D1cCaa	No player at this level of sport lets the other one beat him.On the day the best player wins.In this case I believe it will be great match between two outstanding players.Nadel has really had a difficult semi final.I feel he will be drained.Federer is such an even tempered and balanced player I think he will win.But regardless of this  I am and I hope you also will see a worthy final between two great players and decent ,well behaved sportsmen.|`|lldX3uwcaa	Definitely not.  Well he is not going to LET him win...|`|kfPfhScEaa	He will not let Fed win....Man I mean this is a grand slam why would he let Fed win.And i'm sure they will do they're best to beat each other.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	Nadal would never just let Federer win....its just messed up and Madal wants to beat and show Federer that hes the real deal and is the  1 male tennis player in the world. Federer will work hard to beat Nadal, hes not going to win because Nadal is going to let him, because thats not really fair and stupid.|`|ea059efe053f1e8b4703c42abc3c7a5caa	Well, Nadal is overall a nice guy and he might do it just so Federer can get his tying record to Pete's before Nadal starts to beat on him.  But then again, Nadal has now a chance to win his third slam other than the French and Wimbledon.  It is looking more and more like Nadal will win his complete slam before Federer.  There is no way Federer can defeat Nadal on clay, but Nadal is looking really good on hard courts.  If he wins this, then all he needs to win is the US.  If Nadal keeps his level of play, he might even a complete slam all in the same year.  If you have that chance to do so, I don't care how nice you are, you should give the trophy away because you feel bad.  If you were Federer, would you accept a pity win?  If he does, that's just sad.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	yea, the same way he let federer win wimbledon.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	fed will win

5BQM1hTTaa	16|`|FtkoBEVpaa	I think they get six wins, they'll have an easy schedule but a rookie quarterback.|`|vdmAOQ3Paa	I think after this season they're going to have a lot to prove which gives them motivation.   Just think Dolphins.|`|qCWin81saa	i say 5 or maybe 6 but that will be it|`|CTEQMXFwaa	5, 6, or maybe 7. They'll have Stafford and Mauluga|`|oVz0fde6aa	I say about fix to six games, no more than that, although maybe less|`|AA10689899	they'll probably double there win total from this year|`|SOhzb0H9aa	2. And I don't even know their schedule|`|Bcm0iGuhaa	Probaly 4 or 5. It's going to take a while to recover from the 0-16 season. But you never know what'll happen in the NFL, maybe a miracle will bring them to the playoffs|`|utaxvtZZaa	I'd give them five depending on what they do with key positions - lines, QB. I have no idea what they plan for the draft but I'd look for a free agent QB.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	It's probably a stretch, but I'm going to say 7.|`|qAqsz3bBaa	4

AA12276356	Jordan was a better scorer and defender than Magic was, but that's about it. Magic did everything else better, including making his teammates better (isn't that what it's all about).       Magic won during the most competitive era in NBA history, the 1980's. Jordan only started winning titles after the great players of the 80's retired and the league became watered down by expansion. If it wasn't for that, plus all the promotion Jordan received from the league, he would have just ended up a "bald-headed Dominique Wilkins".      Magic > Jordan|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	NO ONE, even Magic Johnson, can be compared to MJ  So nope, I dont agree!|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Let me know what that is that you're smoking. I need a new drug to sell...Lol|`|5BQM1hTTaa	I dont think anyone had or will have a legacy comparable to Jordan.|`|98wFqBwSaa	No.  Next question.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	magic's career is partly built on his rivalry with bird..jordan transcended rivalry with so much talent and great on/off court achievements so as to become an icon and a legend|`|S0XArokKaa	MJ, nah Jordan owned the game.|`|Xz6zqZAvaa	maybe|`|Y5Bm3rW1aa	Magic was a great player, but, NO. Only way Magic would have had a better legacy is if he had Shaq or Kareem as teammates. Jordan and Pippen were the Batman and Robin of the NBA.|`|EMEet7m2aa	Magics career was not cut short. He left with HIV and came back and retired on his own becasue he was gettin old. He played 14 years wtf. But he still my boy. But no, his legacy would not have been better than Michaels because Michael came and dethrowned him in his around his PRime. And it was nothing Magic could do about it but concede defeat. Because MAgic was still a GREAT player then. Jordan just got tired of losing and imposed his Almighty Majestic Will. ITs was over for the NBA from then on...|`|PSMsDalLaa	No.    Jordan's career was cut short too for different reasons. If Jordan didn't dabble in baseball for the first retirement or even just retire the second time and played throughout with the Bulls, he could have 10 championships with the way the bulls played.     Anyway the way it is, 2 3peat years is pretty much the best legacy only bested by Bill Russel's championships.|`|vuh0i3Axaa	no.... magic would never have a better career... even if he somehow put more points, or rebounds then michael jordan, magic would never have left a bigger legacy then jordan.|`|7domw3t5aa	Naa and Magic would tell u that. Look at some of those old MJ videos yall know the ones we use to watch before middle school basketball games to get pumped. "come fly w me, Playground, etc"... in those videos Magic and bird talk about mike like he's GOD! they knew he was the best ever THEN!|`|GBGcI509aa	Magic was a better player then Jordan in my eyes.

3jBUJxOdaa	both are equally good matches.sorry, they're great matches..i'm not sure if i can pick which one is better had I not known which is played in which and by whom..i mean try to judge it on the greatness of the plays themselves, erase the factor of round, which tournament, which players...but, i know it's impossible..tennis cannot be removed from the emotions and all that drama surrounding every game..having said that, i would pick wimbledon 2008 as the more epic one..first, it's on a final; second, its on wimbledon and whoever wins that makes a history;third, its between the two greatest players and rivals..there's really nothing you can ask for more.|`|AA12034105	Both of them were amazing matches but I think the Wimbledon one still edges it for me ;-) !!|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Well...Wimbledon is Wimbledon, and Rafa x Fed is Rafa x Fed! Gotta go with that one!|`|DExfjVvOaa	the wimbledon 2008 final has a lot more drama by virtue of the history that both players were chasing then.  it was like a theater production with twists and turns in the plot - rain delays, night coming, white cardigans, spanish royalties, classy man crying and high-class tennis.|`|tyslswwmaa	im sure in many peoples minds it will be the wimbledon final of 2008 that was a great match, although the austrlian open semi final was also good and verdasco should of won, semi finals tend not to lbe rembered as much as finals as there importance is not as great.|`|HzzFgaRQaa	quality wise - both tied      my fav - wimby final    - it was a final(more drama)  - it was nadal vs federer(classic)|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Wimbledon Final 2008...|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	roger vs nadal at wimbledon was definitely better than that semifinal. The semi final has some great plays and shots, but its still not close to wimbledon.    Verdasco has a ton of winners, but also a ton of unforced errors, which we didn't see in the roger vs nadal final. Also, wimbledon has a lot more suspensful moments than the semifinal.
H3nbC71eaa	I would love to see Beth vs. Sara Del Ray. Sara Del Ray is just a beast in the ring and a pure athlete in there..and would match up well with Beth's physical style. Sara Del Ray can do it from mat wrestling to being physical also..and is strong also...so it would be a match up of similar styles. Just a match I would love to see.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	Sara del Rey for a more technical match so Beth can show off her mat skills    Cheerleader Melissa for a more all-around match    and Mickie Knuckles for a tres awesome deathmatch, but don't bet on it on a normal show because the WWE is PG. Probably during One Night Stand---er, I mean, EXTREME RULES. DX    All about the chemistry. :)|`|LVrH8W57aa	hmmm  will go with each one you named and rate the matches.    1. Sara Del Rey = that would be an Exelent match betewn 2 amazing wrestlers, Beth has the Athletisme and Streng Advantage (barely ) and Death Rey has the brawling and technical wrestling advantage ( barely), this would be a War in SHIMMER and a main event Level Match for WWE, i think the winner will be Del Rey , the match would be 9/10.    2. Angel Orsini- i haven't seen mych from her, but i can say she has what it takes to keep up with Beth, she is just as strong as beth i think, but since Beth is much younger i will go with her, Beth wins after a down in flames    3. Mercedes Martinez= ah what a match, 2 of the most talented Blond female wrestlers i have ever seen, Mercedes is 1 of the hardest hitting wrestlers today, and is defenetly tougher than beth in the ring, but Beth has a few advantages of her own against Mercedes, the match would do either Way , 8/10    4. Cheerleader Melissa = oh my, now this is a match i would love to see, 2 great wrestlers who has trained in Amature wrestling, 2 great athlete, but i think the Winner would be Melissa, she is just so viscious, Athletic, and amazing on the mat, this wuld be an amazing match , but melissa wins after a kudo driver, 9/10      5. MsChif- these 2 have fought before in SHIMMER , and Beth Won, it was a really good match, and Mschif was very scary in that match, Beth was afraid to get into the ring with Mschif at first . but i saw, Mschif reverse the glam slam in the air into someway pulling out the Cod Green for the win. 8.5/10    6. Lufisto = hmm 2 different styles, i wonder what wuld happen here, if it was a normal match, beth wins, a hardcore match, lufisto defenetly win, i think i will go with Beth as the better and rate the match 7/10.    7.Daisy Haze= wow , Daizee Haze will have her work cut out for her here, Beth is too big and dominent for her i think, and Daizee will soon or later loose by the Glam Slam, but not without  a fight.  7.5/10    8, Mickie Knuckles = ah , just like lufisto, the only difference is, Mickie is tuffer in the ring, and has enough streng and determination to keep up with Beth, Beth is a better wrestler but i think Mickie wuld win here 7/10    9- Sara Stock, i wuld love to see the best from CMLL today go against Beth, what a match high-flying vs strenng, and amazing mat skills vs amazing mat skills, it can go either way, but Sara wins in my opinion . 9/10    the most matches i wuld like to see wuld be against Melissa, Stock, and Del Rey ... if i had to pick 1 , Melissa    starred|`|vgI4YQPyaa	beth vs sara del rey or mschif|`|UWJinEbIaa	Awesome Kong or Gail Kim :)|`|8t1Osybyaa	lit-she would be a good pick why, because she has a great in-ring ability and this would be a good feud for the womens title and actually  a good improvement for the women division,right now its just eye candy divas who are just their to make money|`|NNn84vTCaa	Beth Phoenix vs MsChif please, on Raw, live.

9NRyeif9aa	Wow,it would prolly be a Disrespectful and Disgraceful Screwjob for Taker,i don't want this to happen too.but we know WWE,it's UNPREDICTABLE sometimes,so yet you'll never know.but i'm not sure if Vince would do that a Guy that Contributed a Greatness in WWE.it's like a Backstabb for Taker,i mean He performed,wrestled and entertained alot of Wrestling fans since 1980 just to get screwed?! OMG,it's a Total Disrespect and i mean DISRESPECT,Taker is One of the most Respective and most Loyal Entertainers/Wrestlers/Superstars/Legend... in Wrestling History (since WWF and WCW),i don't he deserves that.and wait a minute,when u said Triple H,i was like woah! HHH?! the guy is too populated. i like him but he doesn't deserve a Screwjob involving Taker.actually Taker doesn't deserve any Screwjob.he needs to keep the Undefeated Streak (so a 20-0 WrestleMania Winning Streak before he retires,so that could be his biggest accomplishment) i totally Respect Mark (Undertaker) he's the Best,some says he's the GOD in Wrestling and i think i might agree with em' Bret Hart's Screwjob was another disrespectful act,but please for god sake Vince,Stop the Damn Screwjob,we've seen it already,your just gonna ruin your own Company.    And Yeah about the Taker winning Streak,nobody will be willing to End Taker's Streak Unless Hunter's Selfishness Strikes again,and here comes McMahon's granting Hunter that Shot.well Bad Move, because Undertaker will remain Undefeated,now that Mark (Taker) signed another 3yrs. of Contract,it looks like the WM Winning Streak will close (not end) in an Undefeated 20-0 Record.no one will beat Taker in Wrestlemania.just don't do the Damn ScrewJob to Taker or else,WWE is ruined.    Undertaker Lives! (HANDS DOWN)|`|JYrvt5s8aa	My question is what is a ******* involving the undertaker happened|`|O6VTWYDtaa	i would poop with shock|`|KIOR56r6aa	I believe WWE will lose majority of their fans, including me if something disgraceful like that ever happens. No one should end it, forward or backward. And I won't be surprised if the fans riot. No one will ever fully respect WWE anymore.    And this is a present for you. The video is not mine, but it's pretty cool.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQqs5K9JQ...|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Great thought and almost certain it would never happen but if it did...    Undertaker would probably retire or if he is still in good condition, could move to TNA which would make it a serious competitor for the WWE. The man who took out Undertaker's streak would receive serious heat backstage from all the other superstars and Vince would lose almost all trust from the superstars.|`|3oUSroiZaa	ANYONE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY ASK THIS QUESTION IS A GEEK!|`|trvqktw3aa	I would go absolutely crazy and find McMahon's house and kill him|`|mDuiiVN7aa	I would snap, go crazy, and never watch WWE again !|`|Q9SjNzbYaa	is he winning still entertaining? i'd say so.     vince will run that into the ground until it is no longer entertaining and maybe even 2 more wms after it just for good measure, vince loves to overkill everything|`|UzHt495Saa	SICKEST AND LAMEST SCREWJOB EVER!! i'll stop watching WWE and watch ROH again|`|3ExtDP45aa	Undertaker can't lose his streak really because that's like Wrestlemania history, although I could see Vince turning his back on Undertaker, but I think WWE fans would go mental if Taker got screwed over.    It just can't happen.|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I would actually be p*ssed off by it! If this happened! We all know Vince's mind can be twisted but if this happened, if the likes of a top dog like Cena or HHH, I would p*ssed off! Sorry but I am speaking the truth! Taker is a Legend of the ring, he likes to put over certain wrestlers who have potential to be good. Never knew that story about Orton but I would prefer a young star over a veteran to end the streak, if that's gonna happen. People who've got bags of potential but if HHH did it, I would be more p*ssed! I see streak continuing until he retires, to be honest - Taker's record at WM is outstanding, the people he has beaten, Flair, Roberts, HHH, Orton, list goes on. I would just be shocked that Vince would actually do this to a person who has carried WWE on his shoulder for nearly 20 years. Taker is amazing at what he does and I hope he still got years of him left to wrestle
LVrH8W57aa	what ? no Ashley Massaro ? she is the best ever, the hottest, she has more talent in 1 finger than all wrestlers combined even man, i mean common who is Lou thesz infront of the legendary Ashley Massaro?    and now that i stopped before i go on a rant of how disrespectfull it was to even see ashley attempt a thesz press, i think the best is probably mayumy ozaki from japan, and i will go with Mickie from WWE, well betewn Mickie and Sherry , i think i will go with Mickie yeah, but Lita wasn't so sloppy thoug|`|JYrvt5s8aa	I do because i'm good|`|O6VTWYDtaa	john cena is gay|`|BglekVnQaa	Hey I haven't heard from you in hellas, but anyway. I think Trish and Lita did the best. Mickie James only does it good because she's big as hell and puts all her weight on you.|`|tX2giFynaa	Beth Phoenix / Trish|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	ODB|`|trvqktw3aa	I would say that Trish or Mickie does i think Mickie looks the best doing it I always thought Lita was pretty sloppy but Trish probably performs it the best technically|`|UzHt495Saa	MICKIE JAMES,YES|`|84yfLzM9aa	Trish Stratus
mDuiiVN7aa	WM is still 2 months away, anything can and will happen until then ! Both men will be at No Way Out in the chamber, so the creative can build some sort of storyline there if they want to.    I think the Dead Man will face either the Big Show or HBK at WM 25!|`|AA11482019	WrestleMania is 9 weeks away.  Just because nothing happened this week doesn't mean they won't face each other.|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	because its to early to say our show something they still have to go through no way out.Duhhhhhh|`|LnXeCC38aa	steve its 25!|`|e6TcpDcxaa	mania is ages away it does not matter if nuffin happens know but i think it will happen at mania i would love to watch it only if they keep kozlov undefated till mania it could be the wrestlemania streak was the undeafted streak|`|1CM3MtcYaa	I don't know, i watched it and i didn't notice anything either. Although it's in theory a good storyline. Unbeaten streak at Wrestlemania against unbeaten streak in WWE?|`|gOLUlRP9aa	Koslov would lose.|`|qZUfwVvTaa	Uh there is still 1 more PPV before WM    so hold ur horses man  haha|`|eNCMYVYxaa	undefeated wrestler vs. undefeated streak
KdhNCnEjaa	I cant see why not, but the issue is maturity.    Give Thompson two years and he could be as good as Chris Bosh, maybe even better. He is loaded with talent, but because he played at Rider is not yet used to the NBA competition. Saying that, he is still doing sick so he should terrify GMs across the league.    EDIT: I meant maturity as in his game, not his personality, he is a great competitor and teammate.|`|vzYJJCdqaa	Yes, of course he can..if brad gets traded, Kenny will defiantly give more time to jason..and jason is doing really really good right now..|`|PSMsDalLaa	He should, dude is pretty good.    Brad Miller is shot too so there is no reason not to play him.
3ExtDP45aa	Try Daily Motion|`|6j8d7TZTaa	try watch movies.com I'm not sure if they have that but its worth a shot.|`|O6VTWYDtaa	john cena is gay
mDuiiVN7aa	Matt vs. Jeff feud is great idea, hopefully they both will benefit from it. And get risen to "main event" status.    As for Christian coming back to wwe and on Sd, I would not jump the conclusions to soon. Lets wait and see how the creative decide on this one.    Sd is a great show no doubt about it, with Christian (one of my favorites) it will be even better!|`|ayFd2u7naa	Did you watch smackdown last night??? The only good part was Matt's promo at the start of the show... I think this feud has potential but neither of them are really that good on the mic so they will more then likely have to carry this feud with their in ring talent... And yes Christian is coming back. He is not going back to that clusterf**k we call TNA.|`|IWPeq2sfaa	Well Jeff Ain't back...but when Jeff returns from his injury it will be.  Christian ain't one of my favorites but i Guess it will make it better.  and i wish RVD would return his appearance at Royal rumble was sooooooo awesome.|`|3oUSroiZaa	WHO AGREES WRESTLING IS FOR GEEKS LIKE THE PERSON WHO ASKED THIS QUESTION!|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	who said christian is coming its not official for all you know he go back to tna and join the mem|`|5BQM1hTTaa	I dont think it's any better.|`|K95QGwsSaa	OF COURSE YES BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE RVD COMING BACK TOO!!    BY LEONIDAS PEPLIS
9Us6XYg8aa	I agree.    Her a and boogey man should form an alliance.    That would be scary.|`|lXp33SwSaa	She draws an amazing amount of heat.|`|goEoTTmuaa	I do agree with you on that issue, its just that they want someone who is more evil and less attractive to run Smackdown. They should have a storyline where Undertaker has a job against job match where if he loses he retires but if he wins he gets her job and she gets fired.|`|xfzjr4uFaa	The only reason Vicky Gurrero is still on Smackdown is because, she was married to Eddie Gurrero. WWE is like one big family, they take care of eachother when its needed. So Vince is keeping her around, so she can have money to take care of her kids.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Gee who would of thunk it.....by sheer accident Smackdown finds a top heel who works the old school carny style by freaking people out with her ugly looks and terrible voice.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Friends of mine have been to several WWE events where they've been in the front row at ringide and they say that the water just lands on the floor beside the ring and on top of the security wall.|`|UzHt495Saa	yeah,specially the Box A,the ppls in front of him are like ''YEAH HHH'S SALIVA'' whooo!!|`|3ieDHPu4aa	maby
WOeMXJBaaa	Don't listen to the first answerer. You are 12 years old andd 5'6"? Wow. I wasn't even 4'10" then.    Just work on your offense around the hoop. Improve your jumpshot. Work on free throws.    You should immediately be dominant on D. Yourr height will scare the little guys and disrupt the opposition with blocks.|`|vzYJJCdqaa	may be....if you are commited and fully dedicated to it then you will   GOOD LUCK:)|`|bABkMrADaa	i think u could be a good PF but u should get stronger and practice posting up, and always practice shooting for a bit just because|`|xvAm4xCRaa	you have dece height for a twelve year old  but not tall enough to play c or pf  i would try working on some guard skills|`|AA10248312	Never been to the free throw line? And you're a C / PF??    No excuse for that.    Go down to the low post and kick butt.|`|12xQlgr7aa	If you work hard and practice a lot. Shoot around a lot, work on you're dribbling. With enough work you can be a great player. Good Luck!|`|kvjodb8Jaa	You have good height and weight, but not for a PF or C. Try to work on ball handling, quickness, and shooting to become a SF or even a SG
PSMsDalLaa	Fans and players need to stop complaining. That would help. It annoys me more when you have idiots complaining when they A) have not a clue of the rulebook in B-Ball, and B) would be extremely worse than the guys out there.    They want to make the right call, but how would you feel when you have so many idiots complaining.    The worst thing to me is when all these morons scream "HEY!!!" every time they drive to the basket. I hope they start giving out technicals or reg. fouls every time someone does that.|`|9cub6mMQaa	Nothing. Bad calls are a part of the game. The referees are human - to elevate them to any other level is simply naive. Besides - a bad call to one player is a good call to another. Just play. If you blame what you perceive to be bad calls on the outcome of the game then you are also extremely naive. The old "REF! He mugged me!" does nothing to make the free throws and layups missed earlier in the game.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	It was all just part of a storyline and a feud that started between them back in 2005, when Eddie revealed that he was really the kayfabe father of Rey's son Dominick.The feud ended at Summerslam 2005 when Eddie lost a ladder match to Rey, with the winner getting custody of Dominick.|`|JYrvt5s8aa	It was about mysterio's son, but i know it was really about santa|`|DiF4GulPaa	about how reys son is really eddies but i dont know if its true|`|BglekVnQaa	Eddie claiming that Rey's son is actually his.|`|O6VTWYDtaa	Over the custody of rey son. Dominick was eddie's son but he gave him to rey around the time of Dominicks birth. Eddie guerrero frustrated that he couldn't beat rey decided to take dominick back so he could break reys spirit.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	They didn't really fall out, the story line was Eddie had cheated on his wife got someone pregnant and they gave the baby to Rey and his wife because they couldn't have a baby them self. Eddie wanted Dominic (the child he "gave up") back to hurt Rey and it ended in a ladder match which Rey won so he kept his kid.     Eddie moved on to the WHC title picture and on screen him and Rey didn't make up but backstage there was never a real problem between them.
