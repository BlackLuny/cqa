I went in for two changes and irritated moles, a rash(that of course is no gone) and a rash on my hips.    She said one mole looked irritated but they didnt look cancerous but she is willing to remove them. For the most part of my visit she was only concerned with selling me anti aging creams from her office at $50 a pop. Telling me I cant buy stuff that good anywhere else, which I have been told in the past is a lie. Even if I were to have my moles removed I wouldnt go to her, Id give my money to another doctor that wasnt so fake. All she cared about was my fine lines. But im not sure Im willing to dish out another $40 to see a different doctor and Im not even convinced my moles are okay. Im still worried about them.

This is for my husband      He has left side numbness......it started in his little finger and they sent him to a neurologist and he figured out real quick that it was the way he was holding his wrist at the computer (he has been doing a data entry job for the last year and a half)      well it worked his way up his arm into this shoulder and face (this was when he went to the neurologist.)      So anyways everything was in the clear (all his doctors have said that)      But after a year he is still getting the numbness on his left side and on his face.....and he was told again its the way he is sitting.      Well if that is the case..what can he do to prevent this.      (Usually by the end of the weekend he is fine until he goes back to work and then it all starts over again)      Could it also be stress?      Could something else be going on?      He has been to several doctors and all gave him the all clear so should he just accept that as okay?      This whole mess started when his Eye doctor (at Sams club) thought he saw something that could be a tumor (though I don't think he is qualified to make such assumtions and talk about it in the waiting room in front of other patients) so we went to another more qualified doctor (who didn't see anything and he went to several doctors, including a neurologist)      Everything has come back clear but I know this still scares him and probably will for a very long time         I'm really worried for him and I just love him so much.   I had no idea he was still having problems

20081114174812AA4VFgR	Health;Women's Health	Am I being paranoid? I just need someone to help me through this... please ?	Well... I'm 20 years old in school currently. I'm a little worried. My boyfriend and I have never had sexual intercourse. Just once when him and I were together last June, his male part touched my clitoris and out of fear that pre-ejaculatory fluid may cause pregnancy, I took plan B. I know even though he had a drop of pre-ejaculatory fluid and didn't insert wouldn't give me much of a chance to get pregnant, but I wanted to be safe. Ever since then I've had periods and all has gone well. We are still intimate physically but we make sure he is covered when he is intimate with me and vise versa. He never touches me after he releases and we make sure that his hands are dry when he comes near me. But... well In Aug/Sept my periods came consecutively on the 14th and in October it happened to come 4 days earlier on the 10th. Now I'm waiting on November... Out of paranoia I asked him the other day if there's a possibility and he thought it was bizarre and said he doesn't have super sperm. I believe him and I think I'm just being paranoid, it's not scientifically possible. My period hasn't come yet and it's already the 14th of November (the day it usually comes) I'm technically not late because it use to come on the 14th in Aug/Sept. But I'm scared there's a possibility. I have sore breasts and that's about it (I usually get that when I'm about to start). Should I worry about pregnancy given the little contact any pre-ejaculatory fluid has come near me? I usually hate it when my period comes, but right now, I can't wait until it comes! I'm just scared I guess...because I've had a "very close" contact and had to take Plan B in june although I didn't have intercourse and it just touched my clitoris... I'm just a little paranoid and I dont want stress to delay my period anymore... I think I'm just going to stop the physical contact in all if it's causing me this much distress... please help me, I really need someone to help me through this as small of a situation as it may seem...:(

I used to get sick all the time, then went probably two or three years without getting so much as a cold (seasonal allergies, sure, but that's tolerable), but then beginning a couple years ago, I've been hit by successive waves of cold, flu, and stomach viruses. I'm not doing anything differently than I ever have, so I'm not sure why my immune system should act up as much as it does, but I'm tired of it. I'm currently dealing with a nasty cold, possibly a sinus cold at that, and an ear infection that developed because of the cold, and I really just want to look into keeping preventative measures.       I've done some research online but everyone has such wide-ranging ideas for what works and what doesn't, and I know it's basically a personal, trial and error thing, but what are some ways you've found to build up your immunity to these obnoxious little illnesses that sideline us every winter?

20060814162200AAG8DCH	Health;Mental Health	Fear of loneliness?	I'm 13 right now and I've been in public school for 2 years in one town. The rest of the time before this, I was homeschooled for 5 years. I didn't know anyone and missed out on alot of life, and I felt really alone. And we moved out of the town I've been in for 2 years, and my parents are dragging their feet on putting me back in school. It's really making me nervous, and they know it. It all really breaks down to being afraid of being alone like I was, feeling like I had no one to talk to and nothing to do. Homeschool in my parents eyes is staying home, 'round the clock, and no sociality. I don't think that they're going to homeschool me again, but I don't want this summer to last any longer than it has to. The reason they're dragging their feet is because we're supposed to move when we get the money, and in my family, "when we get the money" is a very difficult thing to say is easy to do. It's really confusing. What can I do to console the feeling of loneliness until I'm in school?

20060901163616AAYNANg	Health;Diet & Fitness	Are "partials" the best way to isolate and train "under-developed" muscle groups?	Hi:   I just began working with a personal trainer at the gym.  My goal is to gain more muscle mass.  When doing bench press, the trainer limited my movement to only 3/4 of my full range of motion.  His rationale was that because my front shoulders are quite developed, a full range of motion would shift the weight to the sholders, and my pectorials will not get a good work-out.  Does this make sense?  Please help.

20061204165947AAEcjmN	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I need help on burping and farting! Urgent!?	I've been living with these annoying symptoms about 3 years. When I eat I let out air ( big air ) alot. No, it is not burping because it is involuntary. Everyone who hears it says it doesn't really sound like burping. It's just this air I have to cough to let it out right after meal or the air gets stuck in my chest and it becomes extremely discomfortable. Another symptom is farting ( gas in my intestine ). I fart alot and it's getting worse especially when I lie down to go to sleep. After I lie down I feel this gas ball rolling around in intestine and I fart ( sometimes I can't even fart ). I do this about 10 times and then I can go to sleep finally. SO i visited my GI specialist and had endoscopy. I am diagnosed with too much helicobacter. He said burping is caused by that bacteria. He didn't really tell me anything about farting tho which frustrates me.  ANyway he gave me prescription medicines ( Protonix, Amoxicillin, and Levaquin) for 10 days. Help! they still didn't go away. !

20070215064436AA9RgyJ	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is 7 hours enough sleep for someone trying to lose weight?	I have been looking into this and it seems some places say you need the 8 while others say 7 is healthier.    Some personal info:    - I am a 30 year old male, 6foot1 and weigh just over 300 pounds.   - with my body type getting to 265-270 would be ideal.  - My sleep patterns have always been erratic, until recently I would get 4-10 hours depending on the day.  - I am a late night second-winder. Around 10pm if I am doing something that provides any type of stimulation (personal finance, programming, writing, playing games) I lose the urge to sleep and sometimes will keep going until 3-4am. This seems to run in my family.   -When I am asleep I am a very deep sleeper that requires quite a bit of prodding to wake.      Thanks for any assistance.
