HlXUybFEaa	Ciao,diciamo che tecnicamente sarebbe impossibile poichè i segnali digitali terrestri (lo dice la parola stessa) arrivano via terrestre di conseguenza il segnale non  arriva fino a Londra,però c'è sul mercato un decoder ibrido,cioè per metà satellitare e per metà terrestre che ha la possibilità di inseire negli slot la tessera di mediaset premium anzichè quella di la sette.I canali digitali terrestri sono anke trasmessi via satellite ma sono visibili unicamente con questo tipo di decoder,il problema è che si tratta di una sperimentazione e quindi oggi i segnali ci sono...ma domani?

E' NECESSARIO CHE TU ABBIA A DISPOSIZIONE UNA CONNESSIONE WIFI IN QUANTO DOPO L'INSTALLAZIONE DEL NUOVO FIRMWARE DEVI SCARICARTI ALCUNE APPLICAZIONI DALL'INSTALLER!!!<br>  <br>  Innanzi tutto è preferibile eseguire un ripristino (come ho fatto sul mio iphone) anzichè un aggiornamento in quanto molte applicazioni che stai utilizzando sulla 1.1.3  potrebbero avere dei problemi di compatibilità una volta aggiornato alla 1.1.4<br>  <br>  Con il seguente procedimento perderai tutti i dati sull'iphone, per cui per prima cosa sincronizza l'iphone con itunes e fatti un backup del contenuto.<br>  Quindi devi mettere l'iphone in DFU mode; per fare questo, con l'iphone collegato al PC, devi tenere premuti contemporaneamente i tasti sleep (quello sopra, dove c'è l'attacco auricolari) + Home (quello frontale) per 10 secondi per poi rilasciare il tasto sleep. itunes ti rileverà un iphone in modalità di recupero.<br>  Quindi clicca sul pulsante ripristina su itunes e verrà ripristinato l'iphone direttamente con il nuovo firmware 1.1.4<br>  una volta ripristinato, sempre con l'iphone collegato al PC, chiudi itunes e scaricati Ziphone da qui: <a href="http://www.ziphone.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ziphone.org/</a> <br>  Estrai il contenuto in una cartella<br>  Lancia Ziphone e clicca sul pulsante "do it all". Attendi 4 minuti e l'iphone si riavvierà jailbrekkato ed attivato.<br>  Quindi, collegati alla tua rete wifi ed apri l'installer.<br>  Sotto network cerca Bsd subsystem e openssh ed installali.<br>  Sempre nell'installer vai nelle sources ed installati community sources. Poi cerca l'applicazione bosstool ed installala.<br>  Lancia bosstool, vai su freedisk space ed esegui: relocate font, relocate ringtone e per ultimo relocate apps. Questo ti libera spazio nella partizione contenente il S.O. spostando tutto nella partizione più grande e creandoti un collegamento.<br>  Poi collega ad itunes, fai "configura un nuovo iphone" e sincronizza.

Most of these fears are the results of trail lawyers finding deep pockets and relying of those who want to live for ever in a perfect world; becoming part of a class action suit.  It seems that they can convinced you that you need to wash you hands after handling USB cords.   <br>  <br>  What that really is telling you is 1) don't eat the wire and 2) when you have finished using the camera gear, dispose of it responsibly at an electronics recycling point, just as you do when you recycle your electronics, paint and other hazardous materials you use on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  If you really want to be informed, ask for all the MSDS's associated with all your household cleaners.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	The lead is sealed in the cords and camera. You don't have direct exposure to the lead unless you plan on eating the parts. BTW, I don't think lead causes cancer, but it will impair brain function, especially in kids. If you plan on smoking your camera, the various chemicals in the circuit boards and plastic are cancer causing. You stand a much higher risk of health problems from using your cell phone (RF radiation) and breathing air (smog) than using your camera - unless you drop it on your toe.|`|qSrfPxpwaa	Do not eat the camera or the chord.<br>  <br>  Saying that most modern electronics contain harmful chemicals such as lead and mercury in their manufacturing. These are generally sealed in the containers and are only released when disposed of or slightly over time. Your camera is less dangerous than a mobile phone (which irradiates) or large electronics device such as a desktop computer which releases particles from the printed circuit board. The only way you can avoid exposure is to revert to a dark ages like existence free from technology, drinking spring water while farming organic foods out of rage of mobile transmitters, power lines and wi-fi. <br>  <br>  Cynical but that's reality.|`|fVoNpmpFaa	Do you know how many everyday items contain lead?

J'ai eu des Canon Powershot qui permettent de prendre tous du "son".<br>  Quoique je suis passé à un Lumix Panasonic TZ pour son grand angle de départ (28mm pour les connaisseurs).<br>  <br>  Ceux qui t'ont répondu à la va vite Canon EOS 450D : je pense qu'il ont oublié la question d'enregistrement du "son". Le reflexe ne fait pas de multimédia : son et/ou vidéo.<br>  <br>  Moi j'adore mon Powershot G3 : c'est vieux et génial pour la qualité photo (et ca fait du son et de la mini-vidéo) dans le segment bridge, mais tu ne pourra pas l'avoir car 5 générations sont passé dessus. <br>  <br>  Les critères que tu dois prendre en considération :<br>  - taille (sac à main, poche de pantalon ?) et poids (déformer la poche?). Un tout petit appareil leger qu'on trimbale partout vaut mieux qu'un bon qu'on laisse toujours à la maison.<br>  - plage de zoom optique (35mm à X). Mais 28mm est génial pour l'intérieur, et pour la téléphoto : un 120mm devrait etre un minimum mais ca a pas tant d'importance quand on ne recherche pas un Zoom X10.<br>  - autonomie (ca peut être galère de ne pas faire plus de 2 jours...)<br>  - qualité photo (mais y a pas de miracle en compact rikiki, et on a minimum de garantie grace au progrès et aux Millions de PX)<br>  - toujours pour prolonger la discussion sur la qualité photo : le nec plus ultra reste les Reflexes mais à t'entendre, tu n'es pas prête.<br>  <br>  Vous voyez que j'ai pas parlé de nb de Millions de Pixels (hehe).<br>  <br>  Au final, va voir les sites de test avec des exemples de photos prises. Des grands noms reste : Canon Powershot, Canon Ixus, Sony Cybershot DSC, Pentax Optio, Nikon Coolpix, Fujifilm Finepix, Panasonic Lumix ...<br>  <br>  Personnellement, j'acheterais bien le :<br>  - Cybershot DSC-W110 ou 150 ou 300 pour sa taille et fonctionnalités et qualité Sony dans cette gamme<br>  - Olympus μ850SW (petit, étanche, antichoc,..)<br>  - Lumix DMC-TZ5 pour son zoom x10 et grand angle à 28mm et stabilisateur<br>  <br>  En bridge (déjà plus gros et cher) : Canon Powershot S5 IS PowerPlus, mais d'autres sont très bons et tentant aussi.<br>  <br>  Bon, je t'ai pas aidé, avoue.

You may impress technology-savvy people with HDR cameras though ;).<br>  <br>  I think one of the comments above mentioned a camera in a phone. If you have a cameraphone such as the iphone, you can definitely get bragging rights.

af113de04b81b474729aa2c6d7e7fcf3aa	LCD's are better for gaming and movies, because they have less burn-in. The ghost-blur that sometimes lasts only a couple seconds. With a plasma, having that ghost-blur occur too often will lead to permanent burn-in. I was told this by a sales person from Rent-A-Center before I bought my 40" Sony Bravia LCD.|`|alZq38ufaa	WOW, where do i start. 1st let me say that i am no rent-a-center clerk , lol (be thankful) but here is my advice. my 1st advice goes to the person who mentioned "ghost-blur" wow, please leave right now and type in your address bar www.askhow.com or wikipedia. <br>  <br>  now to help. if 32" is your size, then plasma will be a rare find. outside of the vizio at your local wal-mart, most retailers don't carry a 32" plasma, why? cause most major manufacturers don't make one. well simple enough. plasma tends to begin around the 42" size. <br>  <br>  lets focus on lcd for a sec cause i will assume that 32" is in your heart. Most of the trademark issues with lcd won't be an issue on this small of a screen. get out there and look around, see what you like. <br>  <br>  Things to consider, <br>  a tv will only look as good as the signal it receives so an hd tv will require an hd box from your provider. antenna is fine too. <br>  <br>  look at the picture. how black does the color black look. how well a tv can produce the color black is a good guide to get you started. I would also look at the tv both in hd and standard def. a tv's processor starts to show its true ability when it is in sd. some low-end brands will save money by decreasing viewing angle so look from the sides. <br>  <br>  <br>  consumer reports is ok to get familliar with a few models but i have too often seen them consider cost too highly. sometimes you do get what you pay for ( yes i am aware they rate on a list of specifics) i would be happy to give examples. other resources i like better are sound and vision magazine or even the folks on avsforums.com. <br>  <br>  i hope this gets you off to a good start, feel free to ask me more.|`|L69pNvIgaa	I'll make this simple for you:  Plasmas don't really exist at 32", so you really have no choice but LCD.

gRdIvdFJaa	I just got it today. I liked the look of the front from the moment i saw it, so i don't know if you'll get used to it. But i can tell you the little screen isn't that big of a deal. You can text with it and if you get frustrated or make a mistake you just flip the phone open and continue right where you left off with the keyboard.<br>  <br>  I owned the original env before this and the big seller for me was how much smaller it is. I like the shape of it more and i like how it looks. But it does have some nice extra features.<br>  <br>  As far as mobile web 2.0 goes, i used to pay for it with the $5/a month plan. It was pretty good. Not a full fledged web browser but i could type in URLs and stuff. It used up my minutes. I was talking to the guy at the verizon store today and he said they got rid of the 5 dollar a month plan and now they just charge you based on megabyte usage. This means they charge you for how technically intense the site you go on is. The alternative to this is buying the Vcast package for $15 a month and getting unlimited mobile web surfing that doesn't affect your minutes or extra price. (You also get access to VCast video and other verizon services). I got a month free of the Vcast package so I'm gonna test it out and see if i like it enough to pay.<br>  <br>  Overall i highly recommend this phone. The keyboard is great for texting and the outside of the phone is certainly functional for basic features. It fits much more comfortably in my pocket than the env, and i do not regret buying it. Youtube doesn't work, but myspace and facebook do. Any web based email client should work, i use gmail.<br>  <br>  Good luck, the phone is great!|`|sTRbWCYRaa	omg............

b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa	When you output via the AV cables you're getting a signal that's been processed by the camcorder - if you've told the camcorder to display the date, that's what'll be output.  When you use i-link you're getting a straight copy of what's on the tape.  The date / time stamp is embedded in the DV stream but it's NOT displayed.  To do that you'll need to process it.  Strangely, it's not a feature that's included in video editors - try using DV Date instead.   It should work for the Digital8 footage, but I've no idea what'll happen with Hi8!
L69pNvIgaa	Best pair hands down is the Creative EP-630.  They are about $20, and are the BEST sounding headphones for the dollar.

They don't have the range and clarity that you'll look for a good pair of headphones.

xTioPxaVaa	Last year, Guitar Player magazine compared a $5000 Gibson with it's $900 Epiphone counterpart.  At the end, there was a difference, but not $4100 difference in the writer's opinion.<br>  <br>  Epiphones are produced overseas, and that accounts for a lot of the cost reduction.  One of the most expensive components in a a guitar is the paint and finish (mostly due to OSHA regulations on paint booths here in the US).<br>  <br>  There are some other construction differences.  Gibson Les Pauls are usually made with 2 pieces of mahagony glued together (called a pancake body) with a cap of maple on top to brighten it up a bit.  Epiphones usually just have a one piece mahagony body.<br>  <br>  Of course, the Epi's are as ornate as far as inlays, binding, and hardware is concerned.  The pickups may or may not be US made, depending on the guitar (the artists signature guitars like the Iommi and Slash models do have US pickups).<br>  <br>  Epiphones are an outstanding value.  If you buy one, pay $50 to have it set up correctly.  The set up out of the box leaves a bit to be desired.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|8EtpIEplaa	No not really.  I own an epiphone gothic thunderbird and I can't tell between it and a gibson.  Gibson is of some higher quality because they make epiphone and just use some cheaper materials but you pay mostly for a name when you buy gibson.

UK0HFbCyaa	First try getting it repaired/returned/use the warranty like others said<br>  <br>  If all else fails, try these methods, and I warn you, I just made them up. But to make my suggestions more accurate, I need more information. How is the lens stuck? Is it fully extended, will it not come out, is it stuck in mid-zoom...? Also, it won't turn on at ALL? The screen gives no flicker, nothing? Only a lens sound?<br>  <br>  1.) Bang the camera from the opposite side of the lens to nudge it along a little<br>  <br>  2.) If the lens is still extended, try to force the lens back in to click it into original place, and try to turn on the camera and use number 1 if necessary<br>  <br>  3.) Try turning on the camera, then pushing the lens/banging the camera to see if it jump starts. I know hitting electronics to fix them is used as comedy on cartoons and ends up breaking things, but trust me, it works sometimes. My TI calculator wouldn't turn on and I banged it, and it worked again. The vent at my school made this creaky noise and I banged that and it stopped (the noise stopped, but the vent still worked fine).<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have to get it reparied at a shop where you have to pay money, you're probably better off paying some more money and just getting a new camera altogether.|`|lVxhiMopaa	Wow, that sucks. See if anyone at Best buy or a store like that can fix it. If not Do you have a warranty on the camera, Maybe you can return it?  (Depends how long you've had the camera)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	A camera warranty does not cover damage caused by dropping the camera. Your best option would most likely be for you to buy a new camera, because repairs to a camera's damaged lens can be expensive...and could easily cost just as much (or more) than the price of your camera (which only costs around US$135).<br>  <br>  But, you may want to think about getting a quote for a possible repair...|`|A9AkM8CDaa	Does your camera have a warranty?  If so, send it to get repaired. <br>  If not, try moving the lens manually....maybe it just needs a little nudge to get back in track.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, start saving up for a new camera.|`|knm6v0bGaa	if u have not warranty give it to fix shop & don,t open it by yourself to fix it or u will lose it forever ...                          take care.
MowOCI4haa	The fact of the matter is this:  Once you go through the formal process with the telephone company to find and prosecute the person/persons doing the harassing telephone calls...you have no further say in the matter.  The telephone company turns their data over to the States <br>  Attorney or equivalent and they prosecute the offenders.  You will be asked early to sign a "John Doe" warrant which will be used to arrest the offenders.  You won't have the option to withdraw prosecuting the offenders.  <br>       I want you to understand that the offender will most likely turn out to be someone you know.  It could be a family member, friend, coworker, neighbor, friend of a friend, etc. etc.  That is why you are asked to sign a "John Doe" warrant.  They prosecute regardless!  Your personal reasons and/or feelings to prosecute or not have no bearing on the warrant after you sign it. <br>       Good luck and may the good lord take a liken' to ya'.|`|JEo50kzyaa	i suggest not being a little ***** if there anything i hate more then stupid people its people like u that press charges on every little thing|`|457100fed3620574b42ee7b208682b1faa	the statue of limitations for most crimes is 10 years.... there is no statue of limitations that is only 48 hours... <br>  <br>  while it is important to report serious crimes as soon as possible, it is also a good idea to attempt to resolve most issues in a civilized manner that does not require law enforcement intervention.... <br>  <br>  the best option to prevent telephone harassment is to block private callers from calling you by dialing *77 while this is not a fail safe, and there are ways someone can get around this, it will prevent most prank, or harassing calls... <br>  <br>  also familiarize yourself with the benefits of call trace... you can place a trace on the last incoming call if it was harassing, or threatening by dialing *57 before another call comes in... for more info on call trace call 1-877-trace-4-u|`|latqVetPaa	Underneath I put definition from internet. 1st of all what do u think, if u were found calling a married man's phone or something, what do you expect to happen? Just as long as there are no threats against you.... Now remember calling someone fat can be considered harassment, and when calling the person back, your wasting ur time, trying to press charges, if that person, is not downgrading you... <br>  <br>  Bullying<br>  Harassment that can occur on the playground, school, in the workforce (may it be sexual harassment or verbal harassment) or any other place. Usually physical and psychological harassing behaviour perpetrated against an individual, by one or more persons. <br>  Psychological harassment<br>  This is humiliating or abusive behaviour that lowers a person’s self-esteem or causes them torment. This can take the form of verbal comments, actions or gestures. Falling into this category is workplace mobbing. Community Based Harassment — stalking by a group against an individual using repeated distractions that the individual is sensitized to, such as clicking an ink pen. <br>  Racial harassment<br>  The targeting of an individual because of their race or ethnicity. The harassment may include words, deeds, and actions that are specifically designed to make the target feel degraded due to their race or ethnicity. <br>  Religious harassment<br>  Verbal, psychological or physical harassment's used against targets because they choose to practice a specific religion. Religious harassment can also include forced and involuntary conversions.[1] <br>  Sexual harassment<br>  Harassment that can happen anywhere but is most common in the workplace, and schools. It involves unwanted and unwelcome, words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable. Gender and sexual orientation harassment fall into this family. <br>  Stalking<br>  The unauthorized following and surveillance of an individual, to the extent that the person's privacy is unacceptably intruded upon, and the victim fears for their safety. <br>  Mobbing<br>  Violence committed directly or indirectly by a loosely affiliated and organized group of individuals to punish or even execute a person for some alleged offence without a lawful trial. The 'offense' can range from a serious crime like murder or simple expression of ethnic, cultural, or religious attitudes. The issue of the victim's actual guilt or innocence is often irrelevant to the mob, since the mob relies on contentions that are unverifiable, unsubstantiated, or completely fabricated. <br>  Hazing<br>  To persecute, harass, or torture in a deliberate, calculated, planned, manner. Typically the targeted individual is a subordinate, for example, a fraternity pledge, a first-year military cadet, or somebody who is considered 'inferior' or an 'outsider'. Hazing is illegal in many instances. <br>  Police Harassment<br>  Unfair treatment conducted by law officials including but not limited to excessive force, profiling, threats, coercion, and racial, ethnic, religious, gender/sexual, age, or other forms of discrimination.

5Sw7TPGtaa	It won't really matter if you leave the disc in the console while its powered off. But by all means if you want to remove the disc when you power off the machine you should go ahead.<br>  However, I recommend against moving the console if there is a disc inside, probably not a good idea to do that as the disc may get scratched.|`|gO4OnSkbaa	no, be sure to protect your disc, any media player will scratch the disc over time|`|rZKo9bQ7aa	The "general" answer for this in most consoles is no, it should not.  If it's overheating, maybe it might be good to take it out, but otherwise shouldn't make a difference.<br>  <br>  If the unit is being transported, you might want to remove the disk just in case since while it's not very likely, it is possible for the game disk inside to get damaged if the unit gets bumped around the wrong way.  One of my friends has a first-gen XBox 360 and he scratched his Lost Planet DVD when powering up the system after transporting it with the disk inside still.  Happens less with newer XBox 360s since they use a different drive.|`|i9m7Jxcraa	No, because less handling of the disc the better. That's where the damage comes from with disc.

ZFuiy3Tsaa	Double check your sync settings to make sure it is not set to automatic. If it is then make sure the music is still in a folder that Zune is monitoring for music. If it gets moved from the monitored folder then it will be removed from the collection.
35HZNbGOaa	Well the song's location in your computer must have moved (so fiddling with folders might have done it), unless you have deleted it by accident by pressing backspace...which i always do.<br>  I suggest going to 'start' then 'search' and just search the name of the song. If it comes up then just click it and delete the old song that cannot be played because of missing file. If you cannot find it then indeed it has been deleted.|`|2LcKGq8gaa	you can write a complaint to apple, just go to your account settings, look at your receipt and write a report for the missing songs.  two of my songs went missing a while back too.  apple is really good about getting back to you on it.  good luck! :)|`|CCCWGJCHaa	go go PC Power!! like captain planet only with more fail and less heart.|`|AA11618843	Haunted pc.......no doubt about it!  :)|`|vPJm9JYvaa	Right click on the song and find were the file is?

MS has fixed all the issues that were causing the majority of RRoDs (mainly the type of clamp holding the motherboard; the old ones were prone to warping).

Hay telefonos que estan bloqueados para que solo se puedan utilizar con las tarjetas de una determinada marca y otros que no.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a los prefijos, el numero 34 es el prefijo de espa?a. El numero 6 indica que es un numero de telefono movil, ya que todos los telefonos moviles espa?oles comienzan por ese numero (los fijos usan el 9 y algunos de los telefonos de tarificacion especial empiezan por 80 o 90).<br>  <br>  Para las compa?ias, hay cuatro operadores dominantes: Movistar, Vodafone, Orange y Yoigo. Esos cuatro operadores poseen antenas propias, y las alquilan tambien a otras peque?as compa?ias (OMV, operadores moviles virtuales).<br>  <br>  En cuanto al precio, creo que lo mejor es que vayas a una tienda de telefonia y ellos te podran informar mejor.|`|eb70c205e9cbfd6627743e0be126b08eaa	Buenas tardes, no tiene nada q ver el numero seis para indicar la compa?ia ya que ahora pueds cambiar de compa?ia manteniendo el numero que tenias en la anterior , antes si pero ahora no , por un lado creo que ha quedado claro.

7AOufyRZaa	Well first of all, the question is do you have a mac or a PC?  You can use very basic software to do this, such as iMovie on your mac.  But it is always best accomplished in the program you plan to edit the footage in.  I couldn't give specific instructions unless I knew the program you were using, but there are some very good online tutorials for almost any program you choose.<br>  <br>  Second, that being said, your camera should be equipped with a firewire port that allows you to use the camera as a 'deck' for 'capturing' digital video to your hard drive.  If it didn't come with your camera, the firewire cable can be picked up at Best Buy for less than ten dollars.  Bring the camera with you when you get the cable.  Also be sure your computer has a firewire port as well.  If not, you may need to purchase that equipment as well.

nPQQLqUWaa	Your card may be corrupted or accidentally formatted. Try putting it into a card reader on a computer, and see if anything can be accessed (by viewing the card as a removable drive - not using an auto upload wizard). If you can't, you may need to recover the images. <br>  <br>  There is some free software available online, but it is not always effective. Your local photographic specialty store should be able to attempt a recovery on your card - but there are no guarantees that it will be successful. This is a good reason to upload and burn to CD/DVD regularly so that you do not loose all of your pictures at once.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

AA12275186	The variable is the graphics card in the PC. The display can handle the 1080 P but can your PC output it? At a minimum you will get 1024 X 768 ( standard XGA ) The good news is that the 15 pin cable used for a standard monitor will carry the signal. If your PC will output 1080 or even 720, will may need a cable that goes from 15 Pin HD (standard monitor cable ) to 3 RCA's for component video. <br>    Good luck. <br>  |`|B6iGvW3baa	just do it <br>  as VGA is uncompressed format so what ever is coming from your video card is presented on the screen, see that your video card is hdmi and data you want to read is compressed in hdmi format.|`|n2ghNX4zaa	Yes, you can easily connect your laptop to your HDTV and you will get wonderful quality picture.

j5Apt8hWaa	It would be an excellent idea to tell us what brand SLR you have ... is it a 35 mm or DSLR?<br>  <br>  If Nikon DX lenses will vignette when used on a 35 mm camera, if Canon, EF-S lenses cannot be used on 35 mm Cameras.<br>  <br>  Once we know what camera you are using, the easier it will be to link you to photos.<br>  <br>  18-135 mm lens is a medium wide angle to telephoto range on a DSLR<br>  28-135 mm is a near standard focal length to telephoto range on a DSLR, wide angle to medium telephoto on a 35 mm camera.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	For your example, the difference is in the smallest focal length, 18 or 28 mm, or about a 1.5x factor. You can take any picture and crop the width and height by 1.5 times in a photo editing program to simulate the difference in focal length. In Photoshop, this adjustment is called Canvas Size. For example, if you have a 3000 x 2000 pixel image, cropping it to 2000 x 1333 pixels will simulate the difference between 18 and 28 mm with regards to the view angle, or magnification. This only covers the magnification factor. There are other considerations like distortion (pin cushion, barrel), vignetting, chromatic aberration, and focus across the field. There are also other issues such as minimum f-stop and minimum focus distance that you may be interested in. These issues depend on the quality and build of the lens.
GgGNAqApaa	Well yeah, the more kills you get, the more experience (XP) you get<br>  <br>  If you are trying to get more guns and accesories i would recommend you play Search and Destroy. Every kill you get is +50 Exp. But the bad thing is if they kill you, you can't respawn. But when you reach the max level, i recommend you play Free-for-all. It's a very good game-mode.|`|Lkj7HxAwaa	U have to play online and as your class increases you will get new weapons and abilities.|`|5oe5k8DJaa	As you level up (you gain experience after getting kills and completing challenges, if you get enough experience your rank gets higher) , you unlock new and better weapons. The more kills and headshots you get with each individual weapon the more accessories/camos you get for the gun. Not only do you get weapons/ accessories as you level up, but you also get perks (which are sort of like superpowers) and of course a keener sense of the playing areas. This was a deep upset for me, but you can only equip one accessory at a time, so don't get to excited. That means I can't have that ACOG Scope/ Grenade launcher I've always dreamed about :(|`|L69pNvIgaa	The online game runs with an experience (xp) system, where you level up the more you play.  As you gain higher levels, you unlock more weapons.  <br>  <br>  The accessories are earned by completing the acheivements for each weapon, which can be found in the Barracks part of online.  As you attain more kills, the accessories will unlock
38619f0f81204837c01cf800f96fba31aa	its almost certainly a white balance issue<br>  check what white balance the camera is using (effectivley WB is a calibration setting on the camera that allows the sensor to be optimised for the type of light thats hitting the sensor. your eye and brain does this automatically but this is a huge problem for digital cameras<br>  <br>  another issue is that LEDs are often flashed at high frequencies to create the illusion of diiferent amounts of light, rahter than turing the voltage down, if you alter the frequency you save power, keep the coverage. so its possible you are taking a photo at the precise momen the led is of or cycling.<br>  <br>  |`|HFuI8oVYaa	Sounds like your exposure meter was being fooled. This can happen on any camera. An experienced photographer may recognize these issues before they take a shot and are able to compensate by metering off a suitable area or overriding camera settings. <br>  <br>  Many cameras have an exposure compensation control. It may be labeled "EV". In your case, it sounds like your image was overexposed, thus you would want to use a negative EV compensation setting. Experiment to see what value works.<br>  <br>  As to wrong colors, two things can do this. Overexposure issues can change colors due to one imager color saturating before the others (digital images from your camera are composed of red, green, blue; or RGB; colors). EV compensation can help this. If your camera has a color histogram, this effect is clearly seen. As the previous poster said, white balance can cause colors to be off. The automatic white balance on any camera can automatically choose the wrong setting. You should have an override which allows you to choose the proper white balance setting. With LED lighting, you need to experiment as the LED lights probably have a color spectra that is foreign to your camera. You may need to do a custom white balance if your camera allows you to do this or correct in a photo editing program.<br>  <br>  Without seeing your images, it is difficult to say what sort of issue you are having. Perhaps a combination of both settings (EV compensation and white balance) is required. This is where understanding basic photography concepts is helpful in creating nice images.

YiY9Yd2Jaa	Can you post an example image?  What sort of camera is it?  A P&S with a fixed lens or a DSLR? <br>  <br>  With some more information I might be able to help you. You can edit your question to add information.<br>  <br>  Ok, I just looked at your samples and although I have a pretty good deal of experience with digital cameras - I have not seen anything quite like it.  It does look as though banks of photocells on the sensor are failing, but not uniformly - which is strange. I just looked at your exif data - it is a Sony DSC-S700. That is almost three years old and probably not worth spending money on repairs.<br>  <br>  Although it might - even at that age - be worth contacting the manufacturer as there were a number of sensor recalls for faulty sensors back then - your camera 'might' be subject to a free repair or upgrade - many Canon cameras were recalled in 2006/07.

But a point & shoot Kodak? Actually, even pros would use smaller capacity cards...makes sense when transferring.<br>  You'd be better off using a 2, 4 or 8GB card max, but 32GB is extreme overkill, especially for a point & shoot camera.

I recommend finding one on eBay or Craigslist, it is way cheaper than paying more than $200.00. I took it to T-Mobile & let them know that I wanted a Sidekick Pre-Paid Plan. Where it costs like 15￠/min & unlimited web/IM/textin for a day. They gave me a prepaid sim card & I paid $30 somthing for it. I got the sim card & it comes w/ $15.00 or $30.00 already on the account.

Hope this helps.|`|6nZmXGxfaa	ok....cell phone manufacturer's such as motorola, samsung have an outright purchase option on their websites. so all you need to do is to go to the website of the company tat makes that particular phone and order it from them, tmobile phones are programmed to only work with a sim card BUT if you buy the phone from the manufacturer and tell them what company you are going to, thery can program it to work with that specific carrier....hope this helps|`|J0Ie3XJmaa	It is possible, but only if this one company you want to get a phone from supports the same technology (GSM, CDMA, etc) as the company you are planning to use this phone with. In your case it is not possible, because sprint and t-mobile are not comparable, sprint is cdma, and t-mobile is gsm.|`|C1DsQsWlaa	Well, sprint doesn't have sim cards first of all. And Second of all, you could if it were a different company, but you would pay retail value for it versus paying what you would get for a two year contract.

UK0HFbCyaa	Hehe, I suggest you research online- not only camera specifics but also camera terminology and features, as well as things you want to look for. I will give you some websites- not for good cameras but for general digital help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/?tag=leftColumnArea1.0" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=38/13915/39/317&pq-locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=38/13915/10468&pq-locale=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a><br>  <br>  Those will help you get started with what to look for in a digital camera, give you digital shooting tips, and features you need on a camera<br>  <br>  More pixels do equal better resolution, but more megapixels also equal more memory necessary to save photos, slower performance from your camera (not that noticeable to anyone unless you're really looking for speed on a camera...but most cameras are fast, usually only about one second apart from other cameras). More pixels also mean better prints though, because pixels are basically tiny squares that show part of an image. That's why more pixels gives you better resolution, because the pixels are smaller and less noticeable, and the finer detail can be shown without showing the actual pixels. Last thing about pixels- they don't really matter. Most digital cameras have 5 to 10 megapixels, which are fine for just taking pictures. They are also good for making prints that are small. You only need 9+ megapixels if you want to make poster sized prints<br>  <br>  A memory card is definitely essential. Without out, none of your photos will be saved. I reccomend at LEAST a 4 gib memory card. Photos take up a lot of memory compared to regular typing documents, plus most cameras nowadays also make videos, which also take a lot of memory. Without memory cards, all your pictures will not exist- memory cards are like film.<br>  <br>  You don't need instructions. It's really simple. To transfer pictures to a computer, use the provided cable and plug it in to your computer and your camera. If you have the right software, you can usually figure out pretty easily how to save the photos to your computer<br>  <br>  You don't get digital photos "developed," just connect it to a printer using another cable (most cameras do not include a cable for print connecting, nor do they come with printers) and the printer's manual will walk you through the rest. You can also save photos to your computer, and print it from your computer. There are specific kinds of printers and paper dedicated to printing out pictures<br>  <br>  How much money are you going to spend? A good camera usually costs at least 150 dollars, and really good ones start around 200.<br>  <br>  For a 200 dollar camera, I recommend Panasonic TZ4. It have 10x opitcal zoom, and is pretty small for a camera with that much zoom. It also has a fairly big (2.5 inches) LCD screen for viewing your pictures, and has good scene modes (modes that adjust the camera to shoot in certain settings) and a good automatic mode.<br>  <br>  For a 100-150 dollar camera, I would recommend Canon A590 IS or one of these budge cameras (this website is a very trustworthy website with user reviews as well as editor reviews):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/best-budget-cameras/?tag=rb_content;contentNav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/best-budget-came...</a>|`|AA10722993	If you want a point & shoot camera, look at a Canon Powershot A590IS.   It has 8 MP, 4x optical view,  a viewfinder, and image stabilization and can  manually set the aperture and shutter speed.  A lot of camera for less than $150.   It has very good reviews.  <br>  <br>  Yes, you will need a SD memory card and rechargeable AA batteries and charger.   I suggest the Sanyo eneloop batteries.  They come charged and stay charged out of the camera.  They seem to last longer in the camera, too.   And they can be recharged up to 1000 times.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	usually 6-8 MPs is plenty.<br>  an SD Memory Card is something worth purchasing, most cameras can hold some pics in its memory, but i would rather have a card.<br>  <br>  the book that comes with the camera should explain how to download pics from your camera or memory card to your comp.  dont know about the store, i have a pic printer and do them all myself.<br>  <br>  I actually just went and got a new camera today.  I got a Kodak z1285 with a 5x zoom and 12 MPs.  It was $179 at Wal-Mart and so far I like it.|`|qz9trhYhaa	My Kodak Easyshare Z1285 was about $220 and I think it's amazing.<br>  More px does = a higher resolution, and most cameras do require an external SD Memory card.<br>  <br>  To develop a picture, my wal mart has a photo center and you just pop your card in and print it I think/|`|EHFqesQuaa	Sony Cybershot, the ones that focuses, I'll probably be getting the light pink one.

6ba3f5a12cec5d8398a9d42d17a5464aaa	You don't! That would expose the 35mm film to light ruining it. I used to develop 35mm film at home, and you had to pry open the metal canister, wind the exposed film onto wire reels then place the reels in a lightproof container (very tough). It had to be completely pitch-black, then you use a developing solution poured into the lightproof container for a pre-determined time at an exact temperature, shake it for a number of minutes, then drain that out, pour a stop-bath solution in which stopped the developing process, shake, wait, then pour a "fixer" in which stabilized the image onto the negative. After all that was done, you rinse the film in pure water for a time and remove it, cut it into sections and hang to dry. And that was just for black and white! Color was tougher! And you had to develop your prints, too! Thank goodness for machines, which do all of this automatically!<br>  <br>  You need to take your film and have it developed. They will supply you with negatives. If you want "positive" images, use 35mm slide film and request that it be delivered "unmounted" so you can scan it, or use a slide adapter to scan slides. Either way, use a high DPI setting to get the most detail out of the small, 35mm image. (some suggest 3200dpi if your scanner is capable of it, if not, use the highest available to you). NEVER open a undeveloped roll of exposed film without a darkroom and developing experience. It will be ruined INSTANTLY!!|`|AA11667040	IF YOU DO THAT YOU WILL RUIN THE FILM,  UNLESS YOU HAVE A DARK ROOM I DONT RECOMMEND IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR PICTURES.|`|636f785a179e8ea790e00e2212f9931baa	Your Epson Negative Scanner scans negatives that have been processed.

Unless you plan on developing it yourself, take it somewhere to be developed (you don't have to get prints if you don't want to) and you can then scan in the negatives you get back.<br>  <br>  And oh yeah, I used to open them with a bottle opener.
422d9bea6829f54443f8ad5ee62440fdaa	All Apple iPod music players work seamlessly with iTunes, which is a program that holds all of your music files that are on your computer, a "music library" to be exact. If you only have CDs you need to rip them to your computer by putting them in and following onscreen directions.

Turn your bluetooth and his bluetooth on.<br>  2. Have him go find his song... tehn click copy or move(sometimes this could also be labeled send via bluetooth)<br>  3. Then click look/search for devices... it should look and find you. To check what your name (name you are found under) go to bluetooth settings and then look at your name<br>  4. He should click on your name and a thing should pop up on your screen saying incoming transfer from..(his name) click accept<br>  5. It should then say copying... wait until this is done and then save this song to your phone<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  btw if he has trouble finding you go to bluetooth setup and then click find me1 Oh and next time he bluetooths you something... he can just click you name instead of looking for your phone<br>  Hope this helps and enjoy the music|`|b63fc307012181e55e394b645a959f2aaa	It's not service provider's fault.<br>  some file have anti-copy technology embeded in the file that prevent the file being copied(Send by wireless(BT, IR) or cable connection)

d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Absolutely.  There are some channels where when the commercial comes on, either the wife or me ask the other to turn down the volume.  Then when the program is on, we have to ask the other one to turn it back up.|`|92620f66e294dbeb029c65a8e27b65edaa	yes this is an annoyance but there is something you can do about that, i know that some brands of televisions have volume leveling like magnavox i know of, because my parents had on of these and it would tone down commercials that were to loud.
EDDJF1J1aa	iTunes probably offers some of the better mp3 algorithms, plus its quick, relatively easy to use and will recompress many files at once.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, why do you want the files smaller?  Smaller files (or more compressed files) won’t sound as good.  Once you go below that 128 k/bps threshold, most people can notice the compression.  Once you get to 96 k/bps, just about anyone can hear the compression.  The files will start to sound ‘tin-ney.’|`|3d6ac3d653ccef93aa1a6a4a13d29da0aa	use itunes or media monkey.. look under convert.. normal songs wud be 128 make it 90 or less depending on where ul use it.. if in mp3 players, 90 wud be the best.. for me..|`|AA10791101	If it is already MP3 then leave it as such.  Making it smaller looses a lot of quality.  MP3 and 4 are about as far as a person should go in compressing.  Quality is lost even there.|`|6d2e742fff31d53f69a79e7c939ae969aa	Windows Media Player will do it for free.  If they're in WMA format, open WMP and select the song(s) you want to convert.  Right click the selection and click Send To and select Windows Media Converter.  It will convert the files to MP3 format.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps...<br>  <br>  iTunes will also do it, but is more difficult.  Email me if its iTunes you need to convert...

However, the maximum number of apps can’t exceed 144, and the apps can’t take up more space than your iPod has. For any normal user, the 144 app limit is more than enough.<br>  <br>  Try it out – when you can’t fit any more apps, you’ve run out of room. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|kpPOzMpeaa	i have the itouch 2g, and looove it! =) and i have like three pages of just apps (not a lot, but you don't play as many games as you think you can. + the free games are really good.) but it holds a lot, and it's a lotta fun.<br>  <br>  oh yeah..and more than likely you can fit over 100. i'm at like 50 and mine's not even like 1/10 of being filled.|`|6vv4bxqYaa	Well the fact is that you can surely fit 100 within the memory limit. What i would be more worried about is the iPod Touch working slower than usual. I've heard many people with iPod Touches saying that it works slower if you have too many apps. I would suggest getting the 8 GB one because its a hell lot cheaper, and it could support 100 apps within the memory limit, and leave some space for music and some videos.|`|3x71ccc7aa	I actually just bought an iPod Touch a few days ago, and I've been putting apps on it like crazy. I have about 30 right now and they take up about 200MB of space (one of the apps, a game, is actually about 75MB in and of itself). I'm pretty sure that you could fit around 300+ apps and still have decent space for music and videos if you really wanted to, although I think you'd be hard pressed to find that many apps that you could possibly want. All in all, you should definitely pick one up; you won't regret it.|`|Fn7804Y6aa	it depends on what apps they are and why put 100 most of the good ones cost i have never seen anyone with that many it may be able to hold that many just depends on what they are and are you shore you know what the apps do and there is no real reason for 100

d11550810b647f94383c040c25f5f896aa	Did you check if your phone has an application tha supports opening those types of files?<br>  <br>  Sometimes the size of the file can cause the the application to give that kind of message. If you can find out from whomever sent you the file what its size is, that may give you a hint.<br>  <br>  The data stream could have also been corrupted if you didn't get all of the message onto your phone or a portion of the message has errors making it a corrupted file that can't be opened.<br>  <br>  Another reason could be if the video is in an improper format that is incompatible with your viewing software.<br>  <br>  Depending on the equipment you have with your computer, you may be able to download a device driver that can reset your phone if it's a software problem. Perhaps there's some installation software that can fix those settings so you can view that file.<br>  <br>  If you're sure that this is a software problem that requires reprogramming of your phone, the other option is to visit an outlet for your Cell Phone Service Provider. I go through Verizon and I've been able to go to their outlet store and have them reprogram my phone, which had errors on it. You may be able to do the same depending on your Carrier.<br>  <br>  Technology tends to be a bit buggy though when it comes to the introduction of new technology. Video messages are still in its infantile stages because the data stream and bandwidth needed to transmit files of that size is much larger than with text messaging.|`|26d79b87577280e7220582fcd21b2995aa	it may not support that feature.|`|28b22d8b121a980d6776d13635d1fc13aa	Probably the video format is not supported on your phone|`|2b74e9fd5c3acabbb30c5f7d198b2290aa	that is because the file does not support your phone.|`|e1445889f25c19b538bf531f753d42a1aa	sounds like its the wrong video format.

Go to www.oldversion.com. Here there will be a link under "Multimedia" that says iTunes. Click here and choose what version of iTunes you want. I had to go here because iTunes 7 kills my computer. Hope this helps.

Te aconsejo que visites a un especialista un ENDOCRINóLOGO, el se encargará de evaluarte y darte la dieta para tí. No te recomiendo que busques consejos de  personas que no sean médicos, ya que he conocido muchas amigas que se han enfermado por hacer dietas que le han aconsejado y sobre todo AUTOMEDICARSE ya que normalmene estos medicamentos para rebajar tienen contraindicaciones, entre ellas, aumento de las palpitaciones del corazón, problemas en los ri?ones como nefritis aguda, aumento de la tensión y problemas para dormir, entre otras. Te doy mi consejo porque a mí me paso y me enferme. No soy gorda pero como siempre nosotras las mujeres siempre nos vemos unos kilitos demás por ver a tantas modelos flacas y en huesos. jajaja. Pero de verás si quieres rebajar ve al médico y si no haz ejercicios, quitate las golosinas, no comas entre comidas, toma mucha agua por lo menos recomiendan 8 vasos diarios y sobre todo trata de no cenar mucho, come muchas ensaladas y  comida variada, quitate las grasas y los carbohidratos. Pero considero una vez más que vayas al médico quien te indicará la mejor dieta para tí, ya que el te hará los exámenes pertinentes y de acuerdo a tu edad, contextura fisica y tama?o  el sabrá cuantos kilos debes quitarte y la dieta adecuada  para tu caso en especial. No todas las dietas nos sirven a todas, es decir para algunas si, pero para otras no, porque tenemos metabolismos diferentes.<br>  Bueno amiga espero de algo te sirva mi consejo. Besos.<br>  P.D. Después de las navidades todas y todos quedamos con unos kilitos demás, pero con constancia los rebajaremos, yo ahorita engorde algunos pero ya empece mi tarea de ejercicios y mi comida balanceada para perder esos kilitos que engorde por las fiestas navide?as. jajaj .bye|`|222d51021dff5316079fb660396d725aaa	mediante la amputacion de miembros yo te garantizo 15 kilos menos en 24 horas.|`|0f07c1ec0d4da4bbf610f0f7536f28e3aa	Imposible perder tantos kilos en tan poco tiempo de manera natural.|`|63a14be092f17a8a7df011df61c24a01aa	solo si tenes un sobre peso extremo y te sometes a una cirujia,no hay manera de perder esa cantidad en tan poco tiempo de manera natural|`|789bc2892a7b7469bd835249a393a66baa	mmmmmmmm yo baje 4 kilos en 5 dias, pero 10 me parece una exajeracion jajajajajaja, igual no comas nada de nada, solo bebe agua, pero mas de 1 kilo por dia no bajaras|`|87b6607c02c8ee5652dfc1940fcacbb4aa	Lipo... no hay otra para tan poco tiempo.

If you are wireless, make sure there is nothing in the way of the router signal to your xbox. or you may just be abit out of range.<br>  <br>  thats I can think of at the moment. I hope it hepls.

1ZgfPNyoaa	No a digital to analog converter will not work... you need a ASTC tuner to decode and view the digital broadcasts. Over the air channel - terrestrial broadcasts will only be received by these devices. There are many digital tuners available now and as of next year - 2008 - the federal government will be providing a 50.00 rebate to purchase these new boxes so you can still use your old TV.<br>  <br>  Any old Vhf/Uhf antenna will be suitable to pick up the broadcasts over the air. It does not have to say "Digital ready" on the box!!!
4G41Z3RJaa	I am not sure exactly what your question entails.  If you mean Telco internal lines, they have been digital for many years, except in very remote areas.<br>  If you mean to the house, then the technology exists, but within a limited distance to the Telco office.  It would mean that the Telco's would have to change a lot of equipment to make the lines at the Telco handle the digital links.  I will be one of the last people to have an analog land line, because when the power fails in the area, I still have landline service.  If it was digital then the phones would have to be powered by your own power back up service.  Which I also have being in a rural area.

VZu936Utaa	First off,if you aren't a hardcore gamer then there are really no flaws to the wii(just little things). Buy one!!! The advantages of motion controls and modern day technology are fabulous|`|UysG9U3yaa	I have a Wii<br>  <br>  well sorta...<br>  <br>  I had gamefly and played idk around 40 differnt wii games and liked two of them (metroid prime 3 and SSBB) so after the epic fail that was the wii's library i started taking it over to my dads house to play wii sports with him... he enjoyed it so much i left my wii over there... i havnt played my wii in over a year...  Its got a very weak library of games, the graphics are allready dated looking IMO, really the wii has very little going for it.  it became a pop culture phenomina and thats all that happened.  <br>  <br>  I would not recomend a wii to any one, there are so many other disadvantages and another big one is the online play, you can't just make a screen name like everything else.. your wii has a 10/15 digit number that you need to send your friends to talk to them, then each game, instead of useing that number has there own numbers for you to send to your friends so you can play them... online play on the wii is lagy and mostly a pain in the but.  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped.|`|qaPyaFUcaa	I say it depends on how much you play and who you are going to play with.<br>  <br>  The advantages for the wii are that it's easy to learn, you can pick up the controller and play.  If you have friends come over or parents to play with, they can play the game as soon as they pick up the controller, there's no learning curve.<br>  <br>  The disadvantages are that the rest of the system is inferior to any other video game system.  There are one or two games that can keep your attention for more than a week.  Overall, most wii games are filled with a bunch of minigames that only take a few minutes to play, and they get utterly boring after 20 or so times through.<br>  <br>  I think that if you are the type of person that will only play when you have friends over, or want something that everyone in the family can play at any time, and that is not very often... then the wii is for you.<br>  <br>  If you want to be using it a few times a week and have a bunch of different fun games to play, it's not for you.  It may end up just sitting on the shelf when you realize you don't want to repeat the same minigames anymore.  It's really easy to get attached because it's so easy to learn, but just as easily you get unattached because of the lack of depth of the games.  (Like I said, some games can keep you busy, but only a few so don't flame)|`|ACG8cTpLaa	i have a nintendo wii its fun i recommend getting one it has great graphics very addicting games awsome controls good advantages are u can use a sd memory card frm ur cam an use it as a memory card for ur wii also its good excersise 4u the disadvantage is there not making enuff good games for nintendo wii we need more rated m games or more fighting games|`|PHOyKsmPaa	The wii is great because it make you MOVE to play the game. It is very engaging.They also have the WII FIT which is as great as any membership in a gym. BUY THE WARRANTY. Ours broke again for the second time in two years.|`|JTChYOpqaa	dont get the wii get the playstation 3|`|33LrfQlHaa	Yes, and they're awesome.  I will start with the negatives and move onto the positives.  Hope this helps.  I suggest buying one though!<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  The internal storage is bleak at best with only a 512 internal flash memory — definitely not the hefty storage capacity of its competitors, PS3 and Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  The graphics are not at the level of PS3 or Xbox 360, either, only pushing a moderately better video processor made by ATI than its predecessor, the Game Cube. Don't expect to see jaw-dropping graphics, incredible cell shading, bump mapping, or any of the graphic terminologies that give some credibility to consoles performance capabilities.<br>  <br>  Nintendo has repeatedly expressed that its unit's main purpose is to bring gaming back to the masses. Playing games in high definition at 1080p, photo realistic environments, is just not something you will get out of the Wii.<br>  <br>  The games themselves will certainly not have the kind of graphically stunning visuals that you would expect from a next gen platform either. Wii games are being built on double-layered, 12-centimeter optical discs that don't have the storage capacity of a Blue-Ray disc, or HD for that matter.<br>  <br>  Pros<br>  One of the major selling points of the Wii is the price. At a MSRP of $249 (plus tax), the Wii unit will not be as burdensome as PS3 or Xbox 360. You certainly won't need to take a second mortgage out in order to buy this system.<br>  <br>  Wii is the first console in at least a decade that includes a pack-in game. For $249, not only do you get the console, but you're getting five games in one so you can start with the gaming goodness as soon as you hook up your system.<br>  <br>  Wii sports titles aren't going to win any awards for graphic superiority but it will win for revolutionary game play, thanks in part to the Wii remote controller. By just holding what resembles a TV remote in your hand and then waving it around like a racket or swinging it like a baseball bat, anyone can pick it up and participate. I've actually tried this in the office. We set up the Wii, loaded up the Wii sports game and started off playing tennis.<br>  <br>  My co-workers, who are anything but gamers, are often turned off by video games because of the complexity of the controller mainly. They were quickly drawn to the Wii sports games, and some even asked to play and were able to pick up and play with very little instruction.<br>  <br>  The Wii remote controllers are certainly changing the way games are going to be played on the Wii. Gamers can now swing, punch, dodge, throw, point, pull, etc. simply by performing those exact motions with the Wii remote control in hand.<br>  <br>  The console is completely backwards compatible with the Game Cube, allowing you to even connect up four GC controllers and memory cards as well. So, if you've traded in your GC for a Wii now you can play all your favorite GC games on the Wii system without a hitch.<br>  <br>  WiiConnect24 mode allows your Wii, to remain connected to the internet either wirelessly using IEEE802.11, or with a Wii LAN Adapter, even if it's powered down. This allows for your Wii system to receive updates, game info, etc. The Wii console can also communicate wirelessly to Nintendo DS.<br>  <br>  Through this service, Wii offers downloadable access to 20 years of fan-favorite titles originally released for Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), or the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). You can also get Sega Genesis titles and games from the TUBRO GRAPHIX16 console, as well as indie games made by developers with huge imaginations but really low budgets.<br>  <br>  By no means will you be blown away by graphics nor will you have the savvy online support that Xbox 360 has, but you the easy pick up and play mechanic of this system might turn a few heads maybe even yours.|`|sGEgYtbCaa	Sure the wii makes you move, but other than wii fit and the sports game, there isn't much. The games pretty much suck all in all. I've played quite a few and haven't found any i truly like. I would suggest getting a different gaming system and if you want to move, buy ddr for it|`|CMHpeeqGaa	I have a Wii, its great.

R0iivCXEaa	The only monsters I can think of that's above something or one where you can't kill by just shooting is Daedalus or the Swarm.  <br>  Assuming you are talking about Daedalus, shoot the electrical orbs along the wall when he is very close to it.  Simply shooting it when he's on the other side won't do anything to him.  The orbs will give him a shock and after a few, he goes down.<br>  Assuming you are talking about the Swarm, you won't be able to kill it until you make your way to the huge open area that has 3 or 4 generators.  You'll know you're in this area when you leave Malikov to fight it on your own.  Lure the swarm into the generator and blast your pulse cannon.<br>  <br>  And if the monster is neither of these... Hopefully you have an Auger or a Magnum.  Any other monster other than these 2 listed shouldn't be too difficult to take down with an Auger.|`|yrQFXxcXaa	Shoot it : )|`|WFRooU7Maa	Is this single player or online<br>  Either way, try to throw grenades at it somehow<br>  or find a spot where you can get shots off on it|`|1WgOj89kaa	I have Resiatance 2 and have completed the story, but i cant answer the question because your question is too bleak, it is not detailed enough for me to know what you are talking about.|`|AA11448221	that monster...that glass....and you expect a good answer?
KLL0Acrwaa	The flashing is just a warning that those areas (called "highlights") may be overexposed.  This can allow you to adjust the camera settings and take another photo, if the effect is not what you want.<br>  <br>  To correct it, use the 4-way controller dial on the back.  As you push the controller up or down, you should be able to scroll through different views of the same photo, including a setting with just the photo and no flashing highlights.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	The flashing you see is because you are on the highlight preview mode. This tells you that those flashing areas are overexposed and have lost significant information. Highlight preview mode is my favorite mode, especially with the D40. You can change the preview mode by pressing the up or down arrows on the 4-way selector.<br>  <br>  The D40 exposure metering exposes for shadows, often blowing out the highlights. This is a big gripe with the D40, but Nikon won't adjust the exposure table. It is probably done because people like to take pictures of people in bright sunlight without using fill flash.<br>  <br>  Solution: Use your camera in Program mode and adjust the exposure compensation (+ - button near the shutter release) to a negative number (look in your manual about exposure compensation). I find that -0.7 works best for most situations, but you may need to adjust it to some other setting depending on the lighting. Note that in Program mode the flash won't pop up automatically (a good thing in my book). Having small overexposed bits won't matter, but you don't want large areas overexposed.<br>  <br>  If you like to shoot people outdoors, use your flash to fill in the shadows which will make the picture more pleasing. This is called fill flash. With the camera's built in flash, this is effective up to about 10 feet.<br>  <br>  I recommend reading Ken Rockwell's diatribe on using the D40.<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40/users-guide/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d40/use...</a>

19Oav6ysaa	The XTI uses CompactFlash (an ironic name considering it's the largest of the standard memory cards out there)  If you take a lot of pictures then obviously you'd want to get a big one, i.e. 8GB and maybe a second card as a backup.

It's clear and for the most part and just protects your lens. You should be able to buy the CORRECT filter size on the bottom side of the lens. It should take a 52mm filter not a 55mm. Also I have a Nikon D60 which uses the same amount of memory for each picture. I have a 1gb memory card and a couple 4gb cards. I've never filled up any of my 4gb cards and in fact never even filled up my 2gb. You should be able to put about 350-500 pictures on a 2gb card on the highest resolution. However if you're going on vacation or something I recommend getting a back up card.

YupMCYHlaa	It's changed the whole way we listen to music and other audio material (audiobooks, radio, college lectures, etc. etc.)  MP3 has made it possible to distribute audio material at almost no cost.  We no longer even have record stores.  Companies don't have to press disks, manufacture them, package them, distribute them, store them, etc., they only have to make them available for download.<br>  <br>  Also because of digital media (like CDs), you can copy things over and over.  A copy of a copy of a copy sounds as good as the original.  This makes possible rapid dissemination of uncopyrighted material, or even copyrighted material.  In the old vinyl record days, you could borrow a record from someone and make a cassette of it for yourself. But if you then copied the cassette for someone else, it woudln't sound as good. If they then copied the copy you made it would sound even worse.  But an MP3 can be copied indefinitely!<br>  <br>  Plus MP3s cost almost nothing to store.  20 years ago if you wanted a collection of, say, 500 record albums, you would pay thousands of dollars, even if you borrowed them and copied them yourself. Today you can put 500 albums on maybe 5 DVDs, for a cost of a dollar or two.  And they take up almost no room at all.<br>  <br>  Finally MP3 allows players with no moving parts.  Flash memory based players are taking over from hard-drive based players.  Before long MP3 players, table radios, etc. will have no moving parts at all in them, meaning they'll be much cheaper and last longer.|`|N70ZEHTyaa	music...
