20090223155725AAw6Jg9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i move with my boyfriend in less than 2 years?	I will be a senior this year, and my boyfriend who is almost 18 wants me to move a state away from my family. I really want to move with him but im afraid my parents will get mad. I also am scared about being on my own and having to pay for everything myself. He says if i dont move, then he will move by himself and i can go when im ready, but im scared of losing him.       If you are a parent of a teenager, what would you do if your child decided this?    What would you do if you was in my position?

20090223164237AAvZVxN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm Really Scared - What Do You Think I Should Do!?!?!?	My boyfriend told me yesterday that he was really upset and stressed out from work. He told me when he had the chance, he would call me and talk to me about it. But we got into an arguement after that, and he never called.    I kept trying to talk to him online, and when he FINALLY responded he told me he would call me tomorrow (which is today).      He's not online right now, and he's not picking up his phone.   I'm getting really nervous and worried about him...I want to go to his house tomorrow, but I'm afraid his parents will be there, and I'm scared my boyfriend will be even more angry that I visited him while his parents were home.   They do not have a house phone, what do you think I should do?      **He also used to do drugs whenever he was depressed, so I'm scared to death thinking he's going to go back to them**      Should I go to his house tomorrow if he doesn't call?

My mom has a dr appointment tomorrow and I have to drive her to the appointment in her escalade. She will be getting eye work done, so she cant drive. I am a safe driver and very good. I have my learners permit, and will be getting my actual license soon, just haven't had time to schedule appointment. I have an EXTREMELY busy schedule. I have a day off tomorrow and  She wants me to drive her, which is fine. I just don't like other idiots on the road. I cant take my dads jaguar because hes leaving for business. I handle the escalade well, just freeways and big cars are sometimes intimidating. I have driven it on the freeway before just never by major freeway road construction right around rush hour. Any tips. I will take ti the speed limit and pay attention. 2 hands on wheel, NO distraction.s I just want reassurances. I know I am ready and will be fine, just want reassurances for whatever reason LOL......Thanks!!!!!!!!!
20090223164407AAeXxjC	Family & Relationships;Friends	The leaders and the followers. Sickofit?	Alright, in high school, there are so many cliques/groups, and it's pretty hard to avoid them right?      Well, me and my friends are part of a "group" that are loud, but fun, and basically attract a lot of curious attention.   My certain friend Sasha, is the one that creates much drama between other "groups." By that, I mean almost every other week, at least one person comes up to us, and tells Sasha the, "stop talking **** about me." crap.    I don't want her to be confronted anymore because I'm scared one day she's going to be beaten up by someone because of doing all this stuff and also it makes the rest of us feel uncomfortable watching. Sometimes when I ask her to stop all this gossiping and saying mean stuff, she says she tries to, and trusts me to help her and tells me to stop her whenever she's going to start something new (like gossip.) I tell her I would reluctantly.   Today, she comes up to a person and says, "Why you being like that!?" And was "harrassing" the poor innocent person just for fun, and I tell her to stop, and she's like, "Okay. Okay." And she hesitates, but then she says, "I really want to do it though!" So what do I do to tell her and put it in her head what the coinsequences would be (like being confronted by more people.)??      So that was question one. Here's my MAIN question and please make sure when you're answering this question, you especially answer this question detailitively.    So another day, me and my friends were sitting at lunch without Sasha because she was sick, and then another friend of mine (not close, just friends) says to us, "So...where's you posse leader?" And then one friend is like, "she's sick." And then I'm like, "what the hell!?" To myself, because who said that Sasha was the group leader? Sure, it might seem like it, but it's not. We're just friends and we love hanging out with her, we're not her followers. We're our own people and we do what we want even without her. I don't want it to seem like, without her, everything will fall apart in our little group.   And then later that day, I talk to a close friend and she says, "we can't help it. I mean...if people see us without her, they're going to assume we're losers or geeks. She's our gate to popularity. She's also our friend, so we can't abandon her. But when people see us with her, it's like, we have more attention."   All I'm trying to say is,    how do i tell the public that me and my friends are not Sasha's followers, but just instead, regular people friends with a regular girl, not people worshipping her.    I don't want to be labeled anything! Instead, I'd rather be labeled that girl that fell over her chair in English class or something...      Please help.   It's my mid-life crisis!      Heh.      (PS. Sorry for the long paragraph. I can't help myself.)

20090223165131AAg8ZFx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it wrong to follow my heart ?!?	Let me start by telling you all that I am married . . . . and that I am deeply in love . . . . the problem is that I am not in love with my husband !!       My husband and I have been together since I was 18 . . . . I am now 30. I believe he loves me . . . but in the past has not shown his love or ever told me that he loves me.       I believe now he knows things may not last much longer between us and so he has started to tell me how much he loves me and how much I mean to him. I honestly believe he is doing this because he does not want me to leave . . .  he has not worked for most of our relationship as I have a very good paying job . . . . . and yes i do resent this . . . . but he is my husband and that is how it has been.      I am now deeply in love with someone else . . . . we talk all the time but we unfortunately do not see each other as much as either of us would like. He has told me he loves me . . . . my reaction to him was "no you don't" . . . . but he said . .  well actually yes I do ! and I want to be with you !! I almost fell over because I did not realise how deeply he felt about me. And now that I know it has made me start wondering if I could have the strength to leave my husband.      Things with my husand have been on the rocks for a long time now . . . I do not feel loved or valued by him . . .  he has never hit me but I have never felt emotionally supported and often feel like he enjoys making me feel bad about myself !!      I am torn . . . . I want to leave . . . but my husband tells me he will do something to himself that I don't know if I could live with and tell our children about !!! That upsets me so much . . . . has he got me where he wants me . . .  somewhere I don't want to be yet cannot leave?!?!      I feel lost . . . .

20090223170617AAXPf4W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I do the right thing?	Well my friends girl texted me around midnight, and started to tell me she started cutting again (she stopped the sh*t for 5 months) and I got pissed at her telling her not to do it, but then I thought it's not going to get thru her head so I told her whats the use of me saying don't do it if I know you won't listen. Then she started asking me from one of my other friend's numbers and I remember that last time she did that she ended up flirting with the person (who was me) she got the number from my cousin, and me and my friend got into it over that and are barely friends now. I told her I wouldn't give it to her because I don't want her to end up flirting with him, and then ending up with my friend mad at my other friend. She started to say that I was calling her a slut by saying that and I told her I didn't mean it that way, and then she got pissed and the last text I got from her after she was joking about something that read:      "that was sarcasms...**** you that wasn't"      I got pissed off later and texted her something that said "I dont ****** care anymore, **** it" and two days later I got a text from her saying she's sorry. I never texted her back and at school today we didn't even talk we just barely looked at each other and then acted like we didn't even see each other.      Did I do the right thing?
20090223170008AAP70hT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	QUESTION FOR THE SHY WOMEN, would you act like this around a guy you like?	There's a girl that I have a crush on right now. I've never spoken to her, but we've had a couple of the same classes at college, they are boring lecture type classes where I don't get a chance to talk to her at all though, and I'm pretty sure she's shy and I think that she's never had a boyfriend(even though she's gorgeous). But anyways, whenever I've seen her when we workout at the same place on campus, in class, or in a store I've noticed that she seems to try to avoid looking at me when I'm looking in her direction, but only when I pass do I catch her looking quickly at me. So if your a shy girl do you purposely look away from a guy that you find attractive if you think he's gonna notice you checking him out?

20090223170543AAFjP50	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did she send the text msg. on purpose?	This girl, who use to be a really close friend and I asked her out last week texted me today. To clarify the story. We got into a huge fight. A fight where were "done" with each other and never speaking to eachother. I know she cannot hold a grudge long, and she knows I can never be mad at her. I will admit to myself, that that is true, that I can't be mad at her and that I am just very aggravated and disapointed with her. Anyways, it's been 4 whole days that went by without texting eachother. And tonight I get a picture message from her. A pic of herself actually which she always use to send me pics of her. Almost immediately, she sends me a text saying that message wasnt meant to be sent to me.      I think she did intentonaly sent it to me because it does take a few seconds to send a pic message, and should could of easily cancelled it during that time. And then she sends a standard text right away saying it wasnt for me. If she honestly didnt know it was sent to me. It would of took her longer than a second to realize that she sent it to me.      but maybe she didnt. I know there's this kid Joe who we got into a fight over, who I think she likes. And my name is Jon. So could of it been possible she selected my name in her contacts over me?      Part of me wants to make up with her. Part of me doesnt though. She lied to me about having sex with this kid. And it's just ugh! She knows I liked her alot. And Im feeling that she thinks right now that I still love her. I didnt reply to her text. But Im gonna ignore everything to let her know Im serious.

And my mom went through my phone and saw dirty text messages from me and my girlfriend. This isn't the first time I've gotten caught. She plans to take away the internet and texting off my phone. HER arguement is that shes not going to be paying for my texting if I'm going to be talking dirty and that I'm too young to be talking like that.What should I do?.....I feel bad that I disobeyed her and so does she. But I want her to understand that I didnt/dont do it to disrepsect her. That I have sexual feelings just like everyone else does. And sometimes I need to express them. And to me, texting is the safest way.I've told her that she should be glad that I haven't gone out and had sex or got a girl pregnant. I've told her that theres people at my school that have done much worse than send dirty text messages to their boyfriends/girlfriends. Please help me out as soon as possible.      -thank you

I've been told by some of my friends that he looks at me with a certain deepness and intensity. He's also really flirtatious with me, but in a nice way. Not rude or degrading or anything. Even when I get a little mad at him, he knows he did something wrong and always tries to get me to forgive him. I do forgive him in the end. Lol! But when I think about it, he may be trying to use me. He's a bit of a man-whore. Lol! I need help! What should I do?

And then he made a joke that was pretty funny and his bro said "Your not funny" and I had to stand up for him so I said "Well, at least he's funnier than you".

Today at this party that the school has once every 2 months it was like 40 minutes until the party was over and I was hanging out with my other friend and she, my "bff" Lizzy, came up to me and said "Until you pay Moriah back then I'm not gonna be very good friends with you", and walked away. There are 2 things wrong with this..1. Its none of her business and 2. I paid Moriah back all her money. And then about an hour ago I talked to her friend on the phone and she said that Lizzy was REALLY mad at me and that she was trying to get some of my friends never to talk to me. What should I do? I really dont wanna have to fail 7th grade just because my real friends are in 6th grade and I'm in 7th and I only have 2 friends in 7th grade and they always hang out with lizzy. What. Should. I. Do?

20070103155441AAf2mMC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm crazy about him, what should I do?	There's this guy, his name is Ramsey, and I really like him and I'm really not sure if he likes me back. He is the hottest guy in school and kinda difficult to ask out. I'm really wondering how to ask him out without the embarrassment. He sits across from me in 2 classes, one class is Social Studies and I CAN NOT ask him out in there and there is another class that lasts for 2 hours, its english, reading, and spelling and that is the only class that I can ask him out in. And I remind you before you answer I don't know if he likes me and he can be hard to ask out (sometimes). I only want suggestions on how to find out if he likes me and answers on how to ask him out on a date.

He's a really great guy and we went out once but it didnt work because my friend did it for me. The relationship only lasted for about 1 week. WELL...him and my best friend went out about 1 week after that and it lasted for about 3 days but she broke up off and then they went out again 2 weeks after they broke up and then he broke it off about 5 days later because he thought she was going to break up with him for this other weird guy and she wasnt and he just thought that and he begged her to go out with him and it didnt work she said he was never going out with him again and shes succeeded so far, but he was like obsessed with her so he's still going for her but he still talks about her behind her back (I know because we are good friends and he rides my bus). I really like him and we have been friends since 6th grade and we are going into 8th grade in only 12 days. BUT how can I distract him from her and like me more? He isn't really that attractive but he was in 4th & 5th grade.

20081107095321AAg5pTQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it just that he's not that in to me?	I really like him. He and I seem to have the same values and interests. We seem to have a lot in common. We live 2.5 hours apart, which is a pain. I have been trying to act kind of aloof, so as not to freak him out. We used to talk every day. Then we had a minor mishap, on the physical level, one that I know can be fixed but I'm not sure he does. I feel like he's backing off. Do I risk looking like an **** and spout off that the physical stuff is fixable and the gyno told me how, and I'm working on it. Or do I just wait and see, b/c maybe he's not that into me as a whole. Ugh, I'm so confused, and can't believe I'm feeling this way at nearly 30.

20080926213403AApyjqM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he keep coming back for more?	A guy liked me soo much because I was really nice to him in the beginning and gave him a really nice hug when he was down. Also I was really quirky, I was myself and made him feel really comfortable. That just made him fall for me, I just DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. Before that, he didn't look at me twice, I'm pretty but not gorgeous or hot.      Then I kinda became mean and ignored him and stuff. I couldn't seem to control myself.      But no matter how mean I was to him, he still wanted me and liked me and wanted things 2 be like before. Even if it doesn't seem like it, I truly don't want his heart to get hurt anymore and I want to tell him not to like me because he'll keep on getting hurt because I'm a flirt. Deep down, he's the only guy I've ever cared for this deeply.      Even though I keep breaking his heart, why does he keep coming back for more? He can get ANY girl he wants, he's so attractive every girl in school has liked him AT LEAST once.

20080208191041AAjMzel	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just got stood up... How can I get even?	This girl and I met at school.  We talked for a while and I finally asked her out. We were supposed to meet tonight at around 7. I left her three messages just to be sure, and have gotten nothing in return. The other night she seemed to really be into me. We talked for almost an hour. We had so much in common... So tonight comes, I don't hear anything from her, not even a cancellation.  This hurt me more than it should have because I haven't had a date in a while and I was starting to feel unwanted... Now I know that no one wants me. Anyway, seeing as how I am a very spiteful person, does anyone know of any creative ways of getting even with her?

20081216070930AAt2UD6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I buy her flowers??	While on a recent trip to Las Vegas - I contracted a little 'virus'      Not only was it painful - but there was an unnatural 'discharge'  I figured that the 'professionals' in Las Vegas would have been a bit more sanitary than this.  But lessons learned I guess.       I saw a doctor soon after getting home.  He said I was contagious and prescribed antibiotics.  The meds cleared me up pretty quick (God bless America's healthcare system).      Anyways, I fear that I may have spread this not only to my wife, but her younger sister as well.      I fear that my wife will be upset when she hears about her sister getting this from me.      Will flowers make the situation better?

Mi esposo es ciudadano americano, desde hace un tiempo se comporta super mal, es grosero y hasta a llegado a golpearme en algunas ocasiones. Una vez fue detenido pues me golpeo y como queria arreglar nuestra relacion pedi al juez asesoramiento conyugal con algun psicologo de parejas.Salio de la carcel, pero hasta ahora no ha querido ir al consejero. Lo ultimo es que se ha abierto una pagina en myspace (aparentemente a finales del 2006) y encontre correspondencia con antiguas novias y nuevos contactos.Quiero el divorcio, pero mis documentos de residencia aun estan incompletos.El se ha llevado mi ni?a a la casa de sus padres por lo que estoy desconsolada, la recogio de la babysitter sin avisar. El y su familia afirman de mandar deportarme si insisto en querer pedir la custodia.Mi marido no es ningun millonario y tenia un pobre credito y deudas,desde que le ayudo con ello ha mejorado algo para lo cual tuve que trabajar en ***** pues como dije aun estoy en el tramite.Que creen que pasara?

My husband is great its his ex-wife i can't stand. she hates me because i married her husband.She keeps close tabs with his family calls and chats,gos over and visits...which would be fine except she spends all her time talking about me or my husband and how awful we are.This just causes problems with his family and us as she is very manipulating can cry REALY well and spends all her free time trying to get everyone to take her side and hate us. My husband says just to ignore her as thats just the way she is and will not change. Unforchently they have a 5 yr. old child together so she will be around for at least 12 more yrs.I know i should be the better person but she just knows how to get under my skin.My husband will not say anything to her as he does not want to start any trouble with the ex because of his son.His family said she will always be welcome in thier home because she is the mom of thier granchild.

I was in a relationship where Imy boyfriend moved away for college recently and we saw each other only once a month, but recently we got into a big argument and he broke up with me b/c of third parties who broke us up. He said it wasn't my fault and he wants to be on his own right now. We broke up over messenger and well I can't see his face or hear him and he didn't want me to visit him. Just the day before he was telling me he loved me and wanted me to be over there for good. Well..I talked to him last night and he said that I can still visit but he won't give me another chance because of habits I had such as being too much for him like being late and well he said that I can visit but he knows it won't change anything and he wants to be friends. My friends said it was because the pain of being in a long distance relationship became too much for him becasue when he was home...he saw me everyday. What do you think? He said he will keep in touch..but he didn't tell me how he felt.

20071225124437AA0b5k0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does he feel?! I'm getting mixed signals!?	Okay, so there's this guy I just CAN'T get over named Drew. He used to like my friend Savvy, but now he knows she doesn't like him so he doesn't like her anymore. Well, last night, Drew left the room and his friend Blake was there, but I didn't know that. Well, "drew" asked me out - i kind of thought it was one of his friends, because it didn't sound like him. Well I said "yeah..." and then "drew" IMed me and it all went downhill from there. This is the point I figured out it was one of his friends - "drew" said "o great lets do it tonight...lezz get it on...i wanna make out with you" and i was like "omg.." cuz i figured out that it wasn't him. So drew comes back and he's SO mad at Blake and this was the rest of the conversation:   drew: wait do you really wanna go out with me   me: ...yeah   drew: u do   me: yeah   drew: or only cuz he said I like you   me: no because I still like you   drew: umm......ill think about it. maybe we could be friends with benefits. I don't know what that means but o well!      and i was SO embarassed. And so earlier today my bff Kate, who's known him like FOREVER, was like "lets get on IM" and so we did and Drew was on. So we IMed him and I had sent him a picture of my friend, and THIS was the rest of the conversation:   me: do u think shes pretty   drew: sure   kate: i bet u like her more than me! (she was just kidding, they always joke around and say that they love each other)   drew: no i like u more   kate: but what about caroline she's the one that really likes you   me: Kate, shut up!!!!!!!!!!   drew: ..i don't know      and then, finaly, earlier we were talking and he's like "ill think about it" and i didnt reply and he's like "going out with you" and i still didnt reply and he's like "ok?" and i'm just like "ok". Well, I'm kind of confused about how he feels and what I should do and say and all that. HELP ME, and SOON!

She just found out recently (about 2 weeks ago) that i liked her. She wanted me to Sneak out of my house at around 12:30 last saturday, but she fell asleep and didnt call. The next day she called me and said she felt really bad and asked if i wanted to chill then because she was home alone  (our first time hanging out) so i went over for bout 3 hours and we talked about everything, past relationships and hooking up. She called me a "badass" for my stories and commented "im into badass's" and smiled. Then she later told me i was "really really hot" and i could tell she was flirting with me. Her parents were bout 10 mins away from home and called her to check in so obviously i had to leave, she asked if i wanted to hide in her room or go, and i said it'd be best if i just left becaause it was aobut 11:30 pm. So she started to walk with me home and i told her at about half way she should go back ...

The other day i got my at him and he said "please forgive me, your like my little sister, i don't want you to be mad at me." i was shocked, i knew the possibility that he didn't like me, but the fact that he said little sister, i feel like there is no hope. NOW I'm so depressed, because i really like him and can't stop thinking about him. Do i need to get over him? But i still want to be friends no matter how hard that is, cause he is a great guy. Do you ever think he'll think of me other than his little sister? I need some advice, I'm sooo bummed out.      and lately he started calling me "kid"      uhhh i hate my life.

20090222144842AAjixMn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am currently confused......?	ok..so theres this guy im really in love. and i dont know why. he just makes me so happy all the time. and being with him has been the best. i love him. but theres this little voice in my head (i am no crazy..you know wat i mean) to break up with him. well its more like my heart telling me to do so. but in my mind. i dont want to. i guess im scared. im scared of commitment. coz we're having all this talk about college and wat not. hes an amazing guy and i love him. but why do i get this little feeling that im gonna break up with him?       and i dont have anybody to talk about this coz well my best frnd is his frnd too. so im stuck. and my mom would so tell me to break up with him since im technically not allowed to date until im in college which is lame. but she still accepts him and stuff.       the fact of being with him for a long time scares me but the fact of going through life without him is also scary.      gaaah. is this feeling due to my fear of commitment since i saw my sisters' and mom's failed relationships? or is it because its time to let go?       weve been together for 4 months btw. and his sister's (who is such a pain btw) words just echoes in my mind all the time. "this is the point in relationships where it ends".       HELP!

Talking to her is like talking to a rainbow cupcake with rainbow happy sprinkles on it. Everything is so nice about her and today, we went skiing together and having her talk to my parents makes me look like a total fool. Everything is so perfect and staged about her while my parents have this horrible sarcastic child who doesn't always keep her room clean. Her 95% average is no match for my fairly good average either. Lol, it's not like you can hate on her though, she's too nice!      Do you have any friends like that who just seem to make you look bad?

20090222145216AAKjF8p	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do about a husband who constantly lies?	My husband has an issue with telling the truth. He doesn't only lie about serious things, but about stupid, pointless things. I have confronted him time and time again about it, and explained to him that honesty is so important to me. Without honesty I cannot trust him, and I feel it will ruin our marriage. I have pointed out to him that I am afraid it will wind up causing a divorce, and he says he is sorry and will do better; it never lasts though. Just this evening we got into an argument because he lied right to my face, and he knew that I could tell he was lying. After he realized he was caught in his lie, he admitted to it. I am so tired of having to fight for the relationship to work, it feels so one-sided. What would you do if you were in this situation? I know only I can make this decision, but some advice would be appreciated. Thank you

Sounds nice, huh? We have a 20 month old daughter and he isn't happy with the past 3 months of being unemployed and having to be a stay at home dad. I want to be in a healthy relationship and do my best to show him that I appreciate him, the same way he would for me if I were the one staying home. What are some good things to say or do to show my support for his goals, appreciation, and to be encouraging. I am not good at these things apparently because he told me today that I ignore him and don't appreciate anything he does. Any advice, no matter how rude, obscene, or wise would help.

20090222142748AAoQ780	Family & Relationships;Family	How to deal with my boyfriend's mother?	I'm always very sweet to her and her husband. My boyfriend and I have never given her a reason not to trust us, but lately she has been acting like she doesn't trust us and is being very weird and different. We've been together for about 5 months so it's not that she's just getting to know me or anything. I've thought about just taking a break from going over to their house but I'm not sure if that is the right thing to do or not. When my boyfriend isn't around she is very nice, but when he is there she treats me like I'm not good enough. It's causing my boyfriend and I to argue too. What should I do in this situation?
20090222151853AAFiPYW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I revoke her wedding invitation?	I invited a friend to attend my full wedding. On the night of my henny she had been contacting someone the whole night, through the meals, through the party games etc turns out she agreed to sleep with a guy, anyway, we were all trying to find somewhere to go when we turned round and she and 2 others werent there, after an hour of searching for her we found her and the other 2 with the guy she had been speaking to, we all agreed to go somewhere and litrally 2 mins later when we turned round again she was gone, basically she had ran off without telling anyone where she was going and went with the guy she agreed to sleep with, without even goin out with us at all! Not a drink! Not a dance!  She dumped the hen on her hen night! Thing is people paid for her room, train ticket and food for her, she was even in full dress!  The next day she didnt phone or text anyone so we didnt see her until she cought the train home.  Feel quite hurt and offended by what she did, I would have considered her to be one of my good friends.  I actually spent most of my henny running after her than actually celebrating my wedding.  Maybe im being a bridezilla I dont know!  What do u think?

20090222142422AA6JzgB	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'm miserable! i might have ruined an engagement....?	so we've been going out with my bfs sister and her fiancee for 4 years now. we are basically close friends. when ur around people for a while u notice the wrong things they do right? ( not saying that i dont do anything wrong myself). so what i noticed over the past 4 yrs was that when my bfs sister wants to talk ( sometimes), her fiancee will tell her " stop stop, dont talk". seriously he cuts her off, and she doesnt say anything back to him.    so we went out for dinner tonight, all four of us and the subject was a womans rights, u know how that goes, the girls get defensive etc. now shortly after the long subject ended, she tries to say something and he tells her to " shh, dont talk about that, enough!", she then replies by sayin " no i'm not gunna be a little scared kitten and shutup".    here i decided to jump in ( still in defence gear) and said "YEAAHHHH, wats wrong with u, u do that alot, i've noticed u shut her up often, we've been together for so long, and i've noticed it a couple of times, its dissrespectful dont u think?"... he goes red in the face and she shuts up.    then he starts GOING MAD! tells her out loud that she always makes him inferior infront of his friends and his friends have told several times; that she is very overpowering etc.    i could tell i started a fire and i began to apologize," i didnt mean to hurt anyone, i was just pointing out a little thing... out of love" ( and seriously it was out of love, i wouldnt mind a friend pointing out something). i felt she needed my support, or atleast shine the light on that issue.    i asked if me and her could go to the bathroom and explained to her why i said wat i said, and it was not my place to judge( despite the fact i was using a playfull tone). she said dont worry, i needed u to back me up and what his gunna get judged for is the things he bursted out after u said what u said.    so now, they r in a midst of a fight, god i dont know what i done, i dont usually create problems, i'm very sincere and caring. it just got to me. i sent an apology msg to both after we left the restaurant. but still i dont know how to reverse the damage i caused. please help. its my bfs SISTER. ohhhh talk about bad impressions.   how serious is it? did i do something horrible?
20090222150955AAOL2TU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Neither of us are ready for a relationship but I feel it's a matter of right guy, wrong time...?	I apologise in advance for the long-windedness...      we are both late 20's & have had much (though very different) life experience, upbringings & are from opposite sides of the globe. we both met each other a year ago; neither wanting or at all ready for a relationship -and yet not being able to help falling in love we got together 6months ago.      The first month was so amazingly joyous; he -never having opened up so much with past girlfriends in the same way, allowed himself to live in the moment with such intimacy with me, freely expressing himself & his love for me without any prejudices from his past.    After a month or so we had a minor arguement as is what happens in life, & it was then it seems that reality set back in for him where i guess he remembered the pain & hurt that can be felt while being open to love, and so retreated back to his emotional 'cave' of safety.   I, like him, have had many painful experiences in past loves & yet feel I couldn't be anything but 100% open (& therefore vulnerable) with someone I love, no matter how much pain is felt, knowing that the hurt, however unbearable, is worth going through for such a beautiful love.      ..but at this time i guess he remembered all his past experiences with past girls & how they didn't live up to his expectations, or how they let him down, & so chose to stay emotionally closed within himself, even though we resolved the arguement and continued to be together.   After a full 5months of me unsuccessfully trying to gain back his trust for him to feel safe with me so to once again be open within our relationship, I broke up with him.. -not wanting to, but no longer being able to stand being with someone who couldn't give fully of himself to me & (I felt) no longer seeing a future with me.   we both have issues from our past to deal with before being ready & deserving of eachother's love & trust.. & also more life experience to gain to help us each evolve for one another, and hey, if it's meant to be it's meant to be right?.. & life will bring us together again in a year or two if & when the timing is right, but I can't help but feel stuck, unable to move on with my present life in order to learn and evolve into who he deserves me to be, because I fear his hurt will just bury himself deeper within, & he will resign himself to living a life not open to loving again, & not being able to see me as someone he can trust his emotions to...      I know I only have control over my life & cannot force him to feel, think or do anything (and I wouldn't want to), but I am so scared he wont give us another thought now that we have broken up because it is easier not to go through the pain of dealing with our issues.. & he doesn't want to talk about or resolve anything we've been through, in order to be open to a possible future together.      what do I do to emotionally 'let him go now' myself in order to give us a chance in the future? He is hurt by me breaking up with him (though I think he understandins why). How do get the closure & strength I need to be able to walk away from the guy I still love while leaving it up to chance that we someday can try again?

We were best friends, fwb, and then we started dating. We had SUCH a strong relationship; I've never ever felt anything so comfortable and amazing. We did bicker quite a bit which we were both trying to work on.    2 nights ago my boyfriend got mad at me (he gets mad a lot) that I wouldn't come hang out with him after his plans fell through even though we had both made seperate plans for that night. We didn't resolve that issue for the whole next day and then that night we faught even more although we didn't even see eachother. The next morning he came over and broke up with me. I'm in shock and tears now. He had alwasy said he would never let me go and that if it came down to it we would go to counceling together. Guess that was all a lie?   What do you think about it all? How can i cope=( ?

O and he goes to a different school than I do. So at his school he goes around saying that I never talked to him and that I would never let him pull a move. And his idea of a move is putting his hand down on the seat of the movie theatre seat and wanting me to grab or hold his hand.  What do you think about this stupid person?

20090222142832AAOcY0d	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I am getting married this spring/summer, and my fiance was born in Canada, what do I need?	My fiance and I are getting married this Spring/Summer. He was born in Quebec, came here on a " lottery" as a small child with his family. He served 4 years in the US Army, has a valid social security number, drivers license. We went to get his replacement social security card, they said he has to go through immigration, but he has to re-apply and it costs SO much. If he had hi DD2-14 ? they would have no problems, but we went to the Veterans Affairs, and they sent the paperwork from where he transfered from reserves to active duty. Their excuse ( in front of us to our faces) was that the office he joined from burned down, and lost everything. Now... all we need is our Drivers Licenses' to get our marriage license, and get married, But after that, what do we do? He needs to be able to get his Social Security card, does our marriage automatically make it easier? Being a legal "resident alien", does he have to go to immigration before, after? I have no idea, and everyone I have called is no help.. Hope someone here can.

The son is 21 and I always managed the financial things when married and now he ignores her a lot and so she tries to get me involved to make her life w/him better. Not sure what to do ? I talk to him about his issues and he is at the age of in his mind knowing everything. Again I wonder what she wants besides that ??

Our wedding is set for May 30 and I am getting very cold feet. I fact, I've been so miserable because I am not sure that this is the right decision for me and I dont know what to do. Basically there are things about him that make him less than ideal (baggage, irresponsible, not as intelligent as I would like) and yet I love him anyway. We have been together 4 years and he hasnt changed, but just now these things are starting to bother me. My parents said I have 8 days to make a decsion since that is when the next deposit is due, I am a huge mess and dont know what to do. I love him but I know he is not the ideal man I would pick if I had to do it over again. Can I cancel the wedding yet continue seeing him, or would that just be worse?

The last few long term relationships he has had were with girls he has been "best friends" with. In fact, I really liked him, and he recently started dating a girl he kept referring to as his "Really close friend". Well, him and I were talking the other night. And randomly, he goes "You know I really suck at being close friends with a girl. There are girls I am KINDA friends with. But VERY few I would consider that close friend. I consider you one of them you know.". Sooo, does that mean anything?? And also, is that a way of him saying I am his best friend?

20070830005430AAVGrky	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Instant attraction or strange turn on?	Im a prisons officer who recently witnessed a death sentence and got depressed coz the person who was sentenced was arrested by me whe i was in the police.The most shocking thing came after i learnt that he was the ex-husband of my secretary who in a conversation with me revealed the truth. After she told this we had an instant attraction and we had sex several times. Later i was guilty of it but again we started to do it at least twice a day. For me this attraction to her came mostly coz of her attractiveness and also coz of my control over her ex-husband's fate and her pleasure and admiration for my position and what i did to her late hubby. I still enjoy this relationship a lot but what I dont know is why I get so turned on coz of the above things...pls...explain.

20090222120554AA2w8Z3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Breaking up but staying best friends?	my boyfriend and i are each other's best friends.. but he kinda had an "emotional affair", if such things exist, with his "ex" the first couple months of our relationship.. he didn't physically cheat on me or anything. i just don't think i can ever truly forgive him because i feel like he betrayed me. i know he feels horrible about it and said he would regret it for the rest of his life.. i just can't seem to forget about it, so we end up fighting a lot.      so- do you think it's possible to break up but still be best friends with your ex?
20061207130256AANAbe3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible to find love so soon after a bad break up?	I recently parted with ways with an awful, disrespectful jerk.  Then the other day, I was out with friends and met someone.  (he was a friend of one of my friends and was in town for a few days).  He and I hit it off well and we talk by phone daily as we are in different states.  Its not quite love yet, as its fairly early.  I don't really need advice, I was just curious to see if others believed...

20090222111612AA0w9YJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why are men such jerks?	My husband's ex called this am to say she was "attending a benefit" and couldn't meet us at the usual halfway point to pick up her son (my stepson who visits every weekend). She wants us to drive the full 60 miles to bring him home. I say that is fine as long as she drives all the way to our house to drop him off next weekend. Is that fair? And I also think she should have had the decency to mention this on Friday night when we picked my stepson up. Am I being petty or fair? And, please, no one state anything ugly or nasty- you don't know the full details of all the bs we go through with his ex.
20090222153129AADFvRI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why can't I have two wives?	Seriously, why does the law discriminate against men who wish to have two wives?      I'm a man who wants to have two wives. My motivation for wanting two wives is irrelevant. What is relevant is the fact that the law won't allow me to practice marriage the way I want to practice it. (Isn't America "the land of the free"?)      Under our laws, a man can legally fornicate with two girls at the same time and not commit to those women, but he is forbidden to commit to them under a marriage. Isn't that ridiculous?      Why is it that gays can get married in certain states (under the euphenism of so-called civil unions), but a man can't marry two wives? At least give polygamists civil unions!--I'd be happy with that.      Moses, from the Bible, had two wives (look it up). Why can't I, too?      Seriously, why can't I have two wives?

20090222153524AAif3vw	Family & Relationships;Family	Parental advice needed for my 15 year old daughter.?	My daughter is 15 at the moment(just turned 3 days ago). Since she was about 14,she started not caring about anything and anyone. She has gone down so much in her work, in every subject. I went to two meetings with her teachers to discuss her education and behavior in school.She has not had a change in behavior but she has a ''I don't care'' attitude towards her work. She is a very bright girl but actually never studied towards it all,somehow she always seemed to get A's and some B's. I have tried speaking to her about it,and also screaming.Neither worked. She is a child that tends to sit on her computer all day and not be interested in meeting new people at all, she actually refuses to have no friends because she says she does not want any(she seems to mean it,otherwise she would be upset about that and it's very noticeable). I did try getting her into clubs etc but she just won't participate physically. I tried taking her TV,computer,cell phone, and giving her a book instead.But she just sleeps then,with no bother at all. Once I got frustrated and grabbed her by the hair but she just screamed to let her go,and I had to.But still no improvement. Also I do pay for her English lessons so she can improve,but she has been going for a while now(around 4months,2 hours a week) and I see no improvement.Help me moms!   p.s she has no past in alcohol,drugs,boyfriends etc and I do not see any signs of her being on drugs.
20090222111542AASfXGh	Family & Relationships;Family	50 Years old and not many friends...?	Hello, lately I've noticed my father acting a little depressed lately. His hearing is kind of going and his best friend died die to shrapnel in his body from Vietnam about a month or so ago. I was wondering if anyone had some good suggestions to maybe help him out. He likes racing, and is my little brother's mechanic and support, but the racing season wont start for another couple months. He works as a teacher for a high school and a vocational school teaching graphic design and other computer things.      With that said, does anyone know something good I can do for him? Or something that wont make him so sad. I think suggesting anti-depressants might be a little extreme, as he just needs just more social iteration I think. Anyone experience something similar? Thanks in advanced.

20090222112309AAtlTBr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Any One Feels This WAy About Thier Child?	I have 2children a 6yr old son with my wife and 15yr daughter from previous marriage. The time I spend with my 5yr I look forward to, from taking him to piano lessons, to swimming lessons to football practice. Even playing tennis is fun which I do like. In the other hand hanging out with my daughter is like torture to me. I try so hard to spend quality time with her but even when she talks she makes no sense. She takes about things that do not matter and is just annoying. I feel very bad and guilty. When I divorced her mom she was 5yr and the rest of the 10yrs I have been doing my best to spend quality time with her. I mean you would think since she is older than her brother I could reason with her more and talk to her but that is not the case her 6yr brother makes more sense when talks. I could say no to my son and explain to him and he will understand but my daughter is always guilt. By the way she is been like this ever since I remember, advice about what to do.

I discovered today that my mom found out that I spend a lot of my free time writing erotic material online. I've been doing this for three years and I do have quite a large fanbase. I like what I do and it makes me happy to know that other people like to read my stuff too. Should my parents be mad at me for partaking in such a thing? I mean, my older brothers kept porn (which I'm fairly certain my dad gave them) between their mattresses, and I know that both of my brothers frequently viewed pornographic material online. Is it wrong that I quench my sex drive the way I do? I'm not out sleeping around (haven't even been kissed yet!) or anything like. I'm 16, almost 17, so my hormones are kinda sparked frequently and I think writing and reading erotica is one of the better methods to satisfy myself without being intimate with another person or something like that. Is what I do something that should be frowned upon? Is it normal for someone my age? If my parents are furious with me, then what should I do?

(circumstances are better now)      One side argued  to just let it go and leave the person, the time past for them, and they can just be friends and move on individually      and the other said, that you should always be honest with your feelings; be honest with yourself and the person. dont drag on a friendship if you know thats not what u want, it will only cause problems later.      what do you think?

We have been having issues with my step daughters mother. We do not have a a big chunk of money for a large retainer fee but could easily make weekly payments. We really need someone who is willing to work with us. There is a parenting plan that was put together in 2004 the child was 8 at the time. The mother is the custodial parent and both the child and father want the plan changed giving the father custody with the mother having visitation. We do need an attorney, whether or not the father is granted custodial parent or not the plan still needs to be modified and the mother will not cooperate with us. We have documented a years’ worth of issues and there is one case with CPS against the mother. Does anyone have any good recomentions. We know children can notchoose who they live with but there has been issues with the other parent and we are in hopes of getting her into our home where there is less stress, more stabiity, and most imporantly no yelling, swearing, and hitting of the child.
20090222153605AAaUT9a	Family & Relationships;Family	How should we kick out my sister?	My sister has been living with our mother after breaking up with an abusive guy, in order to get on her feet and settle some debts.         The trouble our mother is having is that my sister is a TERRIBLE guest. Here's a list of a few main things:      - Doesn't help with cooking or chores. Our mom needs extra help due to rheumatoid arthritis in her back and hands.   - Forbid our mom from using "her" phone line and cut the cords to our mom's phones in order to drive the point home. Now the only working phone is in "her" room, which our mother is not allowed into.   - Is paranoid and irrationaly angry at times, to the point where she gets verbally abusive in arguments   - Refuses to help with expenses. Our mom is on a government housing program, and her rent and utilities are dirt cheap. My sister's share of rent and utilities would be less than $100. I kid you not.   - General rudeness our mom feels. She doesn't cook for our mom, and she doesn't acknowledge her when she brings over guests. She also hides her medication from people. Then there's the secretive nature of my sister that's driving her crazy; won't tell her anything and gets super paranoid and angry when she asks.   - The craziest thing was how when our mom threatened to kick her out, she threatened to go to the government housing office and tell her she was living with our mom (which she really isn't supposed to be).      So, we're like "What the heck?!" She isn't wanted at our mom's house, and our mom is soooo apprehensive about flexing some tough love muscles and getting the police to throw her out. What should we do?
20090222153727AAeZFlN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Oh oh, boyfriend help please (:?	Okay so I'm going out with this pretty amazing guy. But sometimes he's a little not so amazing... well whenever we hang out he is super sweet and just acts like I'm his world. It was really sweet when he gave me his hoodie cuz i didn't wear a jacket and i was cold and he wouldn't let me give it back (:  But anyways he's been grounded from his phone for a few weeks so he can't text or call me, but he can get on Myspace and message me on there and stuff. But he gets on like once a week or so. Like I was gone to a camp ALL weekend but I got back today(Sunday morning) and back on Wednesday I messaged him and was like hey do u wanna hangg after i get back Sunday?(: and he finally messaged back last night and i just checked it today because there was no service where i was at. and he was like yeah sounds cool. let's do it. so i was like alriteee message me when you're free (: But he never gets on, even when we have plans and he agrees to them but i can't know times or anything if he never messages back. so we didn't get to do anything today which made me kinda upset because i haven't hung out with him in a week. I saw him wednesday night at church but he completely ignored me. i'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt and just assume he didn't see me but i was RIGHT there lol i thought it was HARD to miss me but whatever. So how come he is SO sweet when he is with me, but he NEVER talks to me or anything. and i dont know the next time we'll get to hang out since he NEVER messages me i can't talk about it, or if he does say he wants to then he isnt going to get on til another week later when it's TOO late. i know i need to say something to him the next time he gets on(whenever that may be) but i don't know exactly what to say because i do NOT want to sound like a horrible, mean girlfriend. so if you were in my shoes and you would really like it to work out better with the guy what would you say without running him off?? THANK YOU SO MUCH to any responses (:

20090222154202AAutJ4X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he is really jealous?	Okay so I have this boy I like named Steven, and he likes me back. He always tells me that he is NOT a jealous person, but yesterday I was talking to my best friend named James and my other bff told me that Steven got jealous and she asked him.   "Steven, you jealous that she is talking to James?"   and he turned red and didnt answer.      Oh and btw he is a Scorpio, so do you think he is jealous and   telling me that he is not just to think that why should I waste my time trying to make him jealous?
20090222154256AA4nEbr	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend is bad at me...Was what I did so bad?	Ok so I went out with couples of my friends yestarday. We went to party at a club. The thing is there was a guy who she thinks is cute , and I thought he was cute too. He and she barely talked, but he came up and started talking to me, and we flirted a little , and then danced. And my best friend was super annoyed.   I'm also kind of seeing a guy already but we are not official.   Was what I did so bad, should my friend be mad at me?
20090222154327AAIaHDL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	19 years old, 10 month old baby, in an abusive relationship...HELP?	have been with my partner for four years now. At times he can be very loving, other times he is emotionally and physically abusive.       The first time he hurt me he threw me up against a wall and strangled me so hard i couldnt breathe. He then appoligised and said he would not do it again. He doesnt even apoligise anymore because it is "my fault" for some reason or another.      Some days he will just wake up in a bad mood yelling and screaming about something so small like there is no cold soft drink in the fridge.   Before i got pregnant i was going to leave him. But then i found out i was pregnant i just couldnt i had to give him a chance.   Well things have just gotten worse since then, when i was pregnant he got so angry, i forget what over, but he chased me into my bedroom and dragged me off the bed and strangled me so hard i couldnt breath (mind you i was around 7 months pregnant).       Now that my son is born he just yells and swears all the time. All weekend he was in a bad mood. On saturday i tried to leave but he took my son out of my arms and wouldnt let me put anything in the car. While holding my son he was yelling swearing and pinned me down on the lounge so i couldnt leave.      It scared me so much that my son will grown up thinking this is normal. My partner thinks all relationship have fights like this because that is what he grew up with (long storey cut short, HIS mum is a drug addict, has 8 kids none in her care most in docs, and a very vioilent woman, my partner raised himself and all his sister and brothers until they went to foster homes) His mother and i do not get along because "i stole her son" after her attacking me while i was pregnant as well, trying to break into my house when im home alone with my son to attack me and destroying my car, i have finally gotten an AVO against her which my partner is not happy about. Mind you this is a VERY large woman and has been to jail.    My partner is also very much addicted to pot and alcohol. Alot of our money every week goes on his habbits, i give him almost half my pay for it because if i dont he would be a nightmare to live with.       He constantly yells and me and puts me down. I dont even want to have sex with him anymore but he forces me to.      I dont know what to do, i want to leave but HOW? where do i go? Everything in my house is mine, eg furtniture, dining set so on...i cant afford to start all over again. I love him but im not in love with him. I dont want my son growing up in this physically and emotionally abusive relationship. But then i dont want him growing up without his dad. And if i did leave i couldnt stand to think that he had visits alone with my son and his mother around my innocent baby boy.       I have this fantasy of when he is at work one day packing up the whole house and moving far far away to the country and changing my name so he will never find me. He says if i ever leave he will hunt me down and shoot me.    Sorry this is such a long post i could go on forever i have so much to say. Please give me some advice.      Dont get me wrong he doesnt physically hurt me every day, the extent only gets to he pushes me down/over, and chokes me, he has never actually punched me in the face that is, he always hits me in the legs and gives me big bruises.  He is nice at times, but daily calls me names and yells at me. yesterday he made me carry BIG bricks up and down the yard in my nighty to see because he thinks i dont give him any "privliages" when he comes home from work.
20090222154404AAOOMTg	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I got an invitation in the mail to a friends wedding. The invite only has my name. Can I invite a date?	If the bride was having the wedding in our hometown... this wouldn't be an issue. I would go single. BUT she's getting married 2.5 hours away and I don't want to go alone. Is it really rude for me to bring a date?
20090222154543AA3nfN4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Recently separated and VERY lonely/bored. Any suggestions?	I am by myself living at my Mom's house. She and my step-dad are out of town, but I do not have much in common with them anyway, they are both over 68 and I'm only 37.   I've been with my wife for over 7 years and after that time I've lost touch with what few single friends I did have.   Church is out, I'm not religious, I'm not into going to bars (too expensive), I really can't get a pet because I can't expect my Mom to care of it when I'm at work all day, I have 2 herniated discs so sports are pretty much out too.   During the week I'm kinda okay, I go to work early and stay late to keep myself busy, but the weekends come and I have a hard time even getting out of bed.   Does anyone have any suggestions for a sad, depressed, lonely and bored guy who doesn't have too much money?

She was very upset, but I insisted and I didnt see her for a month. When I realized how much I loved her I asked her to take me back. At first she was still angry at me, but she finaly took me back.We were happy for the past two months, but last week I asked if she had dated anyone while we were apart - I did not.I found out she not only did date but she even slept with someone she knows from her gym and someone from her work (at different times), she she had regular sex with both, until they both broke it off her. she was hurt by them using and dumping her as well as me rejecting her. Im jealous, but I know i hurt her too. we have discussed the details, though it is hard. this way i let her know it is ok to talk about how she was hurt,but also about how she enjoyed the sex, which she tells me she did - and she has told me new things i can try!Is bing open smart?

Sorry but this has been bugging me, almost every guy I have been out with/dated/ or even had a friendship with has lied to me! My bf of 2 weeks (now ex obviously) lied to me about his job. He said he was manager of City Beach but turns out he was only Assistant Manager and his salary was nowhere close to what he said it was. Before that, a guy I was dating lied to me about his age. Said he was 19 when he was actually 22 (and I'm 17 keep in mind). I'm just so over all these idiots..       Anyway my question is; why do you guys feel it necessary to lie? Do you think that you won't get found out? Are you just that insecure?       ps: I know I can't speak for all guys, so tell me also, if you're a guy (or a girl in a similar situation) if you have ever lied/ been lied to?

20090222114522AAP45l9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you stay or would you go?	I am going to add more detail, so you may want to wait a few minutes before responding.  Thank you!  I have been married to my husband for almost 6 years now.  We met at a Karaoke bar.  I saw him drink, but figured he was just a social drinker, like myself. When we got married, things began to happen differently. Maybe I was blind to not see it before we lived together? I don't know! Anyways, he started drinking liquour, hiding the bottles from me, etc...Once we had an argument when he was drinking.  I was a little scared, so I went into the bathroom and locked the door.  He was outside the door yelling and telling me to come out. I wouldn't so he broke the door.  He told his sister the neighbor's kid did it when to she came to visit.  Once he got drunk and went to work that way.  Since that time, they have been many instances. He shoved a glass table toward me and it fell and broke.  It never hit me, and he claims it was in his way, blah blah blah.  There have been 2 instances where he grabbed me physically and yet he does not remember them because he was drunk.  I have been embarrased in front of family and friends on several occassions, again he does not remember doing it!  Now, the drinking aside: we argue quite a bit. I feel that I can't really trust him completely.  I have started to lose interest in him physically, and don't really get along with my in-laws as well as I would like. (who does?) He says that I am too controlling.  Maybe he has a point, I am not saying I am perfect by any means!!!  I tried to explain to him that I act that way sometimes because I don't trust him fully. Of course that did not go over very well!  I would say on about 4 occasions he has left when we had an argument and ended up being gone for hours, sometimes until 4 a.m.  He was either at a buddies house drinking, or wandering around.   He even got picked up for public intox a few years ago.  He denies he has a problem and sometimes blames me, and also says that he drinks when he is stressed out.  We talked about where we wanted to live before we were married, and he was adamant about moving back near his family.  Yes, I did agree to it!  However, I have also asked him many times to consider other states and he was completely inflexible on the matter.  My parents live on the opposite coast from us.

20090222120018AATA4YG	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do?? My dad is a total idiot!!!?	My parents usually fight over 3 things: How my dad doesn't do anything in the house, how my dad doesn't really know about me and my sisters' lives, and money (i'm not familiar with this one).      So the central problem here is my dad. Too be honest, I agree with my mom: he's a lazy, ignorant person who doesn't care enough about his family to help.       He doesn't know anything about me or my sisters. All he does is check our math/physics/science homework (because he's an engineer). He doesn't know about any of our friends, except the one or two that have been around a lot.       He NEVER helps around the house. It's mostly because he doesn't know how, but he doesn't care enough to learn. All he does everyday is play Spider Solitaire or Web Sudoku on the computer, read the news, and sleep. My mom cooks, cleans, does the laundry, takes care of our activities, and buys us presents. My dad does NOTHING. Well, occasionally he cleans our bathrooms, vacuums the floor, and shovels snow, if forced. The other bad thing is my dad THINKS he can fix everything, but really, he can't, so whenever he tries to fix stuff, it ends up broken and he can't bring himself to admit he's not capable of fixing it and call a pro to fix it.       And my dad has a problem with thinking that he's always right. Whenever we (mom, me, sisters) tell him he doesn't know what he's doing or he's wrong, he always says "You are all wrong!!! You don't know what your doing!". For example, when my sisters USB drive on her comp broke, he said "I can fix it!", so he started attempting to fix it, but he couldn't so he made up the excuse "It's the things you're trying to plug in that are messed up" but we tried both my iPod and my sisters flash drive and they both didn't work. My dad could not just admit the computer was broken and he couldn't fix it.      Should I change my dad?? How?? HELP!!

20090222120635AArZQeP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband lives in the past, lies about stupid things and can't be real with me!  HELP!?	First of all, I love my husband!  We have been together for almost 5 years (off and on) and have been married for 6 months. During the 5 years we have been through much, from infidelity ( not on my part) and a lot of dishonesty. Together we have worked through much, or so I believed. I lost two children in a car accident, which he really never addresses and throws his going to their grave in my face. And then there are the finances, which his money is his, my money is ours.       Two years ago, I ended my relationship with his mother because I didn't feel she was being honest with me and created her own version of situations, with her own spin once I ended our relationship! It's not true, but as she almost destroyed her own relationship with her son, and they do not talk now, she had to put everything thing on me in an attempt to save her relationship with her son. She claims to be a devout Christian, but she is the most evil woman I know.       Last night, my husband brought up that whole situation again. It's been two years and I truly don't wish to discuss his mother!  He had heard my side of the story so many times and honestly it is hurtful to me. I question why he keeps bringing it up, but I am to NEVER bring up his mistakes wherein he hurt me terribly!       There are times I find that my husband lies to me about stupid stuff. So I had him tracked by a private when I was out of town on business. He told me he was home but was tracke to his job.  Why lie? I don't care if he goes to work on a Saturday. Other than I'm told he is making calls from work and on the internet talking to women. (He met alot of women online before we met and cheated with some while we were dating). I am concerned. But my husband denies things even knowing he is caught. Then, he thinks he has a right to bring up the past like its acceptable.        Any suggestions??? I am at my witt's end and I really think I need to end my marriage!

20090222135108AAoIAvL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you blame me for being insecure?	Ive been harassed by girls for 4-5 months from doing nothing bad to them, do you think I deserved it? People don't invite me to anything, I'm polite to them. I try to be friends with guys but they tell me I need ****** help, totally disregard me! Ive done nothing to them.      I'm stuck in a position where I have no car, my parents won't loan me one!! My parents are emotionally needy and they wont help me out! My brother won't let me use the car, everyone is selfish bc they have been hurt before too. I cant go out, make new friends at all....... Then they tell me that i need help, are a jerk to me.         Bc everytime I try to make friends they use me or backstab me or it rubs off on me with their negavity. Or they try to hurt me in some way with negative comments.      Another thing is I'm an emotional shopper, I like to blow my money away when I'm sad. So! How do I save up for a car if I'm an emotional shopper? How can I see a therapist if I don't have health insurance, without a job I can't have insurance and without insurance then theres no therapist!
20090222142107AA8r3ht	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you think I should do?	Well, my dad has been really not so great lately. I mean, like on the weekends when my mom's at work all he does is sit in front of the T.V. all day long while I go out and do the grocery shopping and laundry and everything. And sometimes he gets verbally abusive, calling me names, and saying I'm retarded. Then, after he does all that, he expects nothing but the utmost respect from me. I put up with it because he's my dad and everything, but today he did something that just pushed me over the top.   My mom told me that since my dad just sat around all day, that I needed to get him out to exercise. So today, I convinced him to go to the local park where there's a jogging trail. When we got there though, he just dropped me off at the trail, and said he was going to park the car. Ha! While I was walking, I saw his car going down the interstate. HE LEFT ME THERE! So I called up my mom at work and she got so angry. She called me dad, but he said he was with me, the liar! Then when he came back, I asked him where he went, and he said he didn't go anywhere. He denied everything!   I know I'm ranting here, but I'm so mad. What should I do?

20090222130305AAGzua6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need law and divorce and tax help!?	first let me say i live in philadelphia , I am married but common law seperated. not legally divorce . i have a 3 year restraining order against him . no there are no children involed i was smart enough not to have any with him. ok heres the question and the problem! i have been seperated from him for 6 months maybe 5 in a half. the thing is i dont live at our old apartment anymore i moved out.i changed my mailing address and everything else ..i didnt take his last name either so it made things easier.the reason i havent gotten the divorce yet is it cost way to much im saving for it.and also they say that with in 8 months the person could have a fatal reaction soo i didnt want to jinx anything on myself. okay thursday i went to file for my taxes I was waiting for a W2 form that never showed....on friday i recieved a phone call from my tax man asking me if i had filed somewhere else , which i said no and was shocked! my soon to be ex has filed married! when we were together and married last year i filed single and so did he..because he always owes money! so i didnt want to owe anything or pay for anything i didnt have too.but HOW could he file married?does he have the right?can he do that?is it legal?its sunday right now i called IRS yesterday , I called the gerenal master for the mail , but i wont find out anything till tomorrow! my tax man said its not going to effect my refund which is good , but Im lost i dont understand if i can take him to court for this or sue him , and of course yes iam going to get a divorce now.but i just want to know what my choices are at this point. WHAT CAN I DO?
20090222134423AArlk8r	Family & Relationships;Family	Forced to go on vacation...against my will?	This might sound ridiculous, but I no longer like vacations.   Er, not vacations, but trips with my family. I can't think of one time there hasn't been an argument. One trip my father has threatened to break my arm, and another trip my mother beat me on the side of the head.   And, for some strange reason, they want to go on another one, even though they agree that we fight a lot.      Anyway, they all want to go on another trip.   I do not, because I'd like to avoid the arguments and possibly another threat or beating.   I understand that the intentions of going are good ones....They WANT to have a good time, and I WANT to have a good time, but it never ends that way.      I have told them that I don't want to go. At first they said I could stay with my grandparents or my aunt or something, but now they're telling me I'm going no matter what.   I really just don't want to go.      My mother told me that I'd make my sisters sad. So, I guess I'd only go willingly for them.   But other than that, I really just don't want to go.   They figure that I don't want to go due to the fights, but they still insist that I come along anyway.   I don't understand it.      Is there a way to convince them to stay home, or with other family?

I know girls are tricky, but STILL, i didn't really know how much until this girl embarrassed the hell outta me by catching me right on my cheek with a hella quick slap! The thing was, i couldn't even move at all to block away her hand because she totally fooled me. She smiled right at me and then  she stood with her hip out and put her left hand on it and stood there. I don't know what the hell she was doing, so, of course when her RIGHT? hand flipped out to slap me, she nailed me easily since i couldn't move, i didn't know what she was doing! What kinda move IS that? It was like, impossible for me to block! Will you tell me how to? I didn't hit her back or nothing like that, but GOOOD, that move is confusing!

20090222121133AA3owOp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do good women stay with bad men?	I just want to get some ideas from you fine people about why women stay in horrible relationships for so long, rather than just leaving?  I stayed for 7 years with a man who was abusive to me and our children, cheated on me (even while I was pregnant) and didn't lift a finger to help with anything around the house (seriously, not ever).  I made 3 times as much money as him so wasn't financially dependent at all.  I'm successful, look good (run everyday), feel good, have a lot of self esteem and friends, etc.  I was just hoping he would change and took me a while to realize he wouldn't and then finally filed for divorce.      I think this is not uncommon, so my question is just to get ideas on why women hang on so long to these losers????

My x was very abusive that's why I left him. 5 months ago I met this nice men. I was spending weekends at his place, he was nice, romantic and such a great guy. I enjoyed cleaning his meesy house, doing laundry and loving him in return. Yesterday he showed me his true colors. He would say hurtful this when drunk,so yesterday I wanted him t sit down and watch a movie with me, but he was all over the place taking care of his alcohol. So I just went to the bedroom, took his glass, and dumped everything in the kitchen sink. Oh my gosh he got mad, started yelling and calling me names, he took my clothes threw them on the floor, and asked me to get away his place. He loked me outside and I just there crying cause it was too late to drive. He made me drive himt o the liquor store to replace his alcohol, when we got home he bossed me around asking  me to type his work invoices. When he computer jammed he yelled and called me fat, lazy *****, retarded and awful stuff. I wasn't talking back cause I was shocked and I've never called anyone names. I finally slept in the couch..and he woke up and pretended nothing happened..so I didn't wanna start trouble I left without mentioning or fighting with him. How could he do this? Everybody and his family thought I was the best gf for him..and he told me that too. I left and I'm never looking back

20090222130723AAJXQQ6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My child got into this, and my husband blames HER?	She accidentally or maybe curiously got into some pepper spray (legal in our state).  She thankfully did not spray her face but she did get a good whiff and was burning for quite a while.      My husband's first question was "I am going to lose my job now" (he is a prison guard).      He never asked how SHE was and blamed HER for touching it.      I have had this fight with him since they were brought into this house.  I have told him OVER AND OVER AGAIN I do not want them in this house with little kids.  He leaves stuff all over.      I told him the ADULTS are responsible for ensuring their child;s safety.  This is my child, not his, and now he is trying to make me take sides.        I told him point blank YOU are making me decide between my child and you... well, you are going to lose that contest.      He just doesnt get it.  Nothing is his fault.       Now I am putting my daughter as #1 on my list of priorities.  Any other advice besides this being completely ridiculous?

I am currently in Nursing School and will be for the next two years.  So. . . I thought it might be wise to go ahead and begin gathering ideas for the wedding now so I don't have to be so stressed later while I am in school.  We both are from southern families and don't want anything too fancy.  We'll probably have the ceremony in our church and then a reception/dinner at a country club/outside barn.  I would love some fresh ideas for a wedding.  We're both young. 21 and 24 so I prefer a non-traditional wedding.  Thanks!
20090222135250AAgAdZf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	OH BOY! How do I tell my family I'm engaged?!?	Last week my boyfriend and I had a huge argument and I broke up with him. We both messed up, he lied about something and I overreacted about it. I ended up telling my whole family and my best friend and they all saw me crying and immediately started to bad mouth him. A couple of days later he apologized and we talked things over and realized that we both were at fault. He proposed to me and I said yes! BUT now I have no idea what to tell my family. I think it's best if I break the news to them because more than likely if he shows his face right now it won't be a pretty sight... so I'm just kind of stumped. And kind of scared, although it's not like we're kids (I'm 23 and he's 26) it's just that my family's approval and acceptance means a lot to me. My bf and I have been together for eight years and prior to this my family adored him but when they saw me crying that adoration turned to hate and well, you get the picture.         HELP!?

20090222125358AABsozS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does my husband still have the hots for his crush?	I recently Got in touch with all of my husbands friends from High school on Facebook. Some I know already & some I contacted them through  others. One in particular was a foreign exchange student he had a crush on. This was 20 something years ago(I am 14 years his junior). He told me the last time they spoke he told her he never wanted to talk to her again. He didn't go into details, but 20 years is a long time for a grudge. I contacted her to invite her to our house warming since she is going to be in town. I am not threathened by this ,However I wonder why he has such anmosity towards her & why he sounds somber when her name is mentioned. Is he still in love with her? Is it a good idea to continue correspondence with her,even if my husband is against it. I just want him to leave the past behind
20090222132808AAGvXYF	Family & Relationships;Family	Oh blimey.... what a mess... what do we do?	Right here's a horrible mess I need some advice with or just your opinions...   My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years... we  have a beautiful daughter. We are moving to abroad in the near future (all booked up) and we are really looking forward to it!   Now the problem is with his parents... they are in their 60's.   They are quite posh (or think they are) and are quite snobby about people. Generally speaking they are very negative about everything, always tutting and making disapproving huffs at people. They talk about other members of the family behind their backs and always always find something to complain about. Apart from all this, they also will not let my boyfriend grow up and live his own life.   So, when we first tell them about moving abroad. His mum was in complete denial. Wouldn't talk about it at all. After a while she comes round to the idea... and his parents decide to go on holiday there to see what its like.   Well they come home and have practically put a deposit down on a house for themselves! We weren't very pleased but then thought... we cant stop them from moving too and maybe it would be nice to have them there.    We are hoping that a change in lifestyle would calm them down, make them less negative about everything.   Then.... we are having a family holiday all paid for by them. Its the most beautiful place, wonderful hotel, with a maid to cook for us everyday day too!!! truely lovely.   Yet they do nothing but complain. In fact I really don't remember anything they said that wasn't a negative comment. We also had some kids with us from our family... And I can only describe it bullying. But his parents  told them off for the first 3 days. The kids were not enjoying themselves and were bored most of the time and upset the rest. This really got to me and with all the other bad stuff I felt I had to say something to stick up for the kids.    This eventually turned into me giving his mum a few home truths about how annoying she is. In not a very polite way.   we left for home the next day... my boyfriend my daughter and I.   Since then they have said some pretty horrible things about me to my boyfriend... but now want to sweep things under the carpet and forget it all.   I, however, Have enjoyed the last couple of weeks without their constant comments and huffing. So I have avoided contact with them and although I'm happy to sweep things under the carpet I really don't want to see them as much as I did before.    The real problem is that they are moving to where we are moving to very soon... I'm angry at them for moving in on our dream. I don't want them to come. And I certainly don't want them to bring their nagging and tutting. My boyfriend sticks by me but is of course in a awkward position..... He also isn't as keen to be too near them...... what should we do? say? think?  thank you for reading this terribly long story.

20090222124951AAoHP7c	Family & Relationships;Family	How do you think I should handle this situation with my 21 year old son?	My son is 21 years old and he does not work. He will get a job, be late and irresponsible and loose it. It has been almost a year and a half since he has held a real job. I just recently purchased a house which has a guest house in the back. I rent it to my 23 and 21 year old sons. My 23 year old son is working consistently and my 21 year old does not work because he got fired from his job since I bought the house in December 2008. He does not pay any bills because he does not have any money. I tell him that when I leave in the morning he has to leave too and look for a job. That lasted for 1 week. I tell him that he needs to do work around the house. He will do it but it is half ***. He is a very respectful young man, he has never talked back to me but the bottom line is that he is lazy and I am very tired of going to work to pay the bills when he is just sitting at home making the bills. A year ago he was surpose to go to the California Conservation Corps and live there. My boyfriend a I took him and his girlfriend (she was going too) out to dinner and dropped them off at the Greyhound bus station. Do you know that as soon as we left the bus station, they left too and went to her mother's house. I was so angry. He said that they decided that they could get their lives together here. He has been back and forth from my house to his girlfriends house every since. I am so tired and stressed out behind this boy not working and depending on me and his brother paying all of the bills. I just got in remission from cancer one year ago and I really do not need the stress. One last thing. I told him that he needs to weed wack the weed and he did, but as soon as I took off to go to work his friend pulled up, he put away the weed eater and took off to Arizona to accompany his friend with only half of the yard done. I finished it today but there is absolutely no reason why I should be out there doing any yard work when I go to work and pay most of the bills. One last thing is that he went to jail for domestic violence (which didn't happen by the admission of his girlfriend) and his 23 year old brother co signed his bail.  He owed 800 additional dollars after the first 800 was paid.  I paid 400 with the promise that he will pay me back.  He was surposed to work and pay the other 400.  The bailbonds man called me today and said that they were going to revoke the bail and put him back into custody if he does not pay by friday of this week.  I cannot take it anymore because now it is affecting my other son as well.  We will have a intervention with his tonight when he returns from Arizona and explain to him that we will no longer support him financially.  He will have to go and live at the California conservation corps for 1 year and work to get his life back together or he will have to leave.  If he accepts our proposal, I will pay the 400 dollars to keep him out of jail, but if he pulls that same mess he did last time by leaving the bus station then he cannot come back to my house for any reason whatsoever.  Any suggestions on how to better handle this situation?  Thank you in advance for your answers.

I have a 14 year old brother that is simply out of control simply because my mom never grounds him or yells at him for the bad things he does. Hes nice to me and listens to me occasionally but he beats the crap out of my little sister. Just recently my mom bought him this BB gun that can really hurt you if he shoots it. She says its protect the family. He threatens to shoot us with it and stuff. Once he took that BB Gun and shot the car window, all my friends saw it and we're like shocked, my brother got scared thinking my mom was gonna ground him and ran back in the house. My mom didn't even yell at him over it. She just went out with him and bought a new window or something, idr what they did, but i know he didnt get in trouble over it. Today my sister was washing her hands in the bathroom (shes 12 and hes 14) and he splashed water all over her. Then she splashed water back at him and he got angry and started beating her. I came up and stopped him for a little while, however when he tried to hit her some more the splashed hot water all over him and locked him out of the bathroom. He got even more angry, and when I left the room he spilled hot water and mango juice all over her bed which got her homework and school books wet and all her money wet. Then when I left again he took her money and idk what he did with it. My moms not home, idk where she is since she turned off her phone. I think I should call the cops because as of now hes still doing crazy stuff outside our house. I tried punishing him by not letting him to the mall with our friends, and only let my sister go, I decided to stay home and watch over the house to make sure he wont do anything else stupid. So he took my boots and stuff and threw them across my front lawn in the snow. Idc about that though, I'm just angry because he keeps beating my sister and my mom wont do anything about it. I really want to call the cops.. but I dont' know if they'll do anything about it. I'm older then him by 2 years (15 at the moment) and he knows not to mess with me. However if I hit him, my mom will beat the crap out of me, i know it sounds messed up but thats how it is. My mom only listens to him because she feels bad that hes the only boy int he family, and she thinks hes aloud to do it.. Idk. Thats how it is. >_< My dad died a longg long time ago. There are no guys in the family besides on my dads side but we don't talk to them. And if I hit him, most likely I'll get into big trouble over it with my mom, and he might try to beat me.

20090222141529AACNNxS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is he just being a kiss azzz?	So I never really wear make up or anything and I just usually wear a cute outfit that usually consists of jeans and a cute top or a skirt every so often.      And sometimes on occasion I take the time to get dressed up like in a nice dress and everything and make up and I do something cute with my hair. And I ask my husband "Don't you think I look especially  beautiful today?" And he'll say "No. you're always beautiful to me you don't need all that" and I think the nicest I ever looked is on our wedding day and even then when he introduced me to his relatives he just said "This is my wife Ivette"       But when I'm wearing jeans and a tank top and little or no make up he'll introduce me to meet someone and he says "This is my gorgeous wife Ivette"  And if we go out I feel so unattractive compared to other women,and I think ppl look at him and think he could do betrer. He always tells me "You don't have to feel inferior to ANYONE" Is he just kissing my butt when he says I'm beautiful when I just look normal,and could he mean it when he says I'm still pretty whether or not I'm  dressed up??        And just recently I went to a salon and got  my hair dyed  from it's natural color and  it didn't come out like I wanted it to plus the lady cut it shorter than I wanted,and I was pissed. It used to be red and it was down my back, now it's a light brown and just a little to my  shoulders  and he said I'm beautiful no matter what my hair looks like. I don't even say thank you because I think it's BS.       I have to wonder what he sees.Could he be biased and saying this because I'm his wife??

20090222143720AAV9cJS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	There is no going back....?	when you commit adultery against your husband, repeatedly, is there any going back?  I mean, even if you were in a bad marriage, but your husband made wonderful changes to his personality, can a wife go back to him after cheating a few times?  Or should she just make a relationship with the guy that she committed adultery with?  Can that relationship with the "other man" really work out, or would it be just a rebound relationship?  Any mature thoughts on this?        My husband is really a good man...but I just don't think that there is any going back to him after all that I have put him through.     I guess that I didn't treat marriage as sacred.

20090222142358AAuL6vh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice please: So that's just it .. :$?	okaay so, let's just say there's this guy. let's call him brad now.       and that's just it. brad.brad.brad.brad. I can't get the name out of my head. it's just something about him.. it's all starting now.      before it was just you know, we had nothing to do with each other. casually we'd talk. we don't hang out in the same cliques.. or anything. but we'd somehow end up starting a conversation out of no where.       the way I feel. is just so, weird.    and the way I think, also weird?   I mean, I've been seeing things that remind me of brad.   (ex. I saw "brad's initials" on the trains passing by, or a movie character using his name on T.V)   and it just seems so.. wow.       what is this?       I mean, I've never pictured this happening.    at first it was just a little crush, which seemed like centuries ago.   and this year we're graduating.. then entering a whole new place, we're we'll both be with x95488686 different people. will it still be the same, I wonder?       this just seems so. GAAH.    unexplainable.       I always end up thinking about him.    and him?   welll.. let's call these two other people lyn and rachel.    this kinda seems pretty childish but lyn and rachel go up to brad and ask him a random question out of the ordinary of who he likes.. they mention my name :$ and they say he starts to blush and doesn't respond.       WTF is that?    I don't know if they were being serious or not.    but it just seems to make me wonder alot. . .       what am I thinking?    what should I do?

20090222143504AAhe7n0	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need closure from a friend to make sure I'm not transferring due to a love interest... what do I say?	This girl is one of my best friends.  I'm probably not one of her best friends, but I'm close enough of one where she was willing to pay $50 and take a 3 1/2 hour bus ride to visit me after I transferred from my old college (where we met).  We talk frequently through IM's/chats/Facebook posts, and I realized the last time she was here that I still have mixed feelings towards her.      The problem is, I have been suffering from major depression, and believe I transferred schools because of it.  I was unhappy there, transferred and was even unhappier (I was going to kill myself), I'm getting help now though.  I am seriously considering transferring back to my old college, and I need to make sure it isn't because of a love interest that might fall through.      I'm going to visit her in 2 weeks, how would I even begin to talk to her about something like this?  Odds are she doesn't feel the same way, I know this, I know she's sleeping with someone (whom she has told me she likes but not in any sort of true romantic sense, he is basically a rebound guy unfortunately for him).  I don't want to scare away one of my best friends, and now I'm getting depressed again writing this but I'm so completely lost...

When they said marriage isn't easy i didn't know it was this difficult..      I just had a big argument with my husband...currently going through the bashing of heads in our marriage.      I respect his independence and i am not asking for him to become a dependent of me. But i would just like him to at least now see our marriage more of the grounds that when we said our vows we have become one, and the life we share together should be taken on board as in if we do something, we should communicate of our well being and so forth.      However i feel like my husband is so far, but near (due to the hardship he is facing in life which is causing him to be depressed)...i almost feel like if i am not contributing physically then my marriage is going to be on the rocks.       I do not know what to do anymore... I fear if i am physically being of use or help he will see me as unworthy or not supportive, whist he construct areas of life which are bleak.      My question is what should i do... Am i trying to hard to lets say be the "perfect" wife which is backfiring, what should i do?

20090222142401AAogc4T	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why do weddings sometimes bring out the worst in people?	My older sister is getting married this August! I'm so happy for her, but this is her second wedding. I think my mom was hoping she'd have something classy this time as her last wedding was a Lord of the Rings themed wedding. I found it very beautiful! Her ex-husband was dressed as Legolas (and pulled off the part well!) and she wore Galadriel's dress. It was absolutely beautiful! Now that she is getting remarried, she is having a cat themed wedding. Okay, it's not my thing, but if it's what she wants I'm game. But my mom gets so upset over it! I still live at home (I'm 23 and in college) and all I hear day-in and day-out is "Why can't she just grow up?" and things of that nature! It gets so frustrating! And then she turns on me and starts saying things like "I'll never let you plan your own wedding or we'll get something stupid from you too!" (Which she is trying to convince my boyfriend and I to go ahead and get married... so far not working, we want to finish school!) Why can't she just be happy for my sister? Is it really that big of a deal?      Why do weddings bring out the worst in some people?

20090222143619AAm1Q0k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my wife right on this?	My wife suffers with a moral dis-phobia. The futile woman is unable to decipher what's right or wrong. This isn't usually a problem unless she's right. As most of the time during all discussions, I tell her where she's going wrong. and with one wave of the arm, all is well.   As some of you know it suffers with a stammer, and I often send her to the bar with a note attached to her forehead, so she always arrives back with the correct drinks. However, only this morning, her brother Brian, whom I recently declared as the village idiot, turned up at the manor with a peace offering in the name of Lucy. After an abhorrent amount of gin and several jam tarts we headed for the marital bed. Obviously, as a gentleman of a high social standing, The following morning I had my head valet burn the bed sheets and evict her from the grounds. My question is, do all women of the working gutter-class have the months of the year labelled on their underwear and smell of kebab? My wife is in denial, and insists on answers.   My good friend Rotter has had a similar experience also!

20090222142636AA0nFNJ	Family & Relationships;Family	I am seriously crying right now my whole family does marijuana right now at least that's what I think......?	My parents do it...... I found a pipe sitting out in the fire pit and a lighter and my parents had a herby smell to them!      My brother had a bong under his bed, three boxes of reefers and a mint box with little specs of marijuana..... and in his drawer was a orange medicine thing filled with something called venom but Im not sure if its for medical use.      My other brother had friends over and they spent the night in the granny suite and when they left it had the same herby smell! And it happens every time when they are over!      Do you think I might do marijuana because im growing up with it!!! HELP ME!!!

20090222143315AADRo0g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think of this?	I'm in college now and have always had problems talking to boys on the "relationship" level. I have no problems getting boys to notice me and I get a lot of comments from people saying that i'm pretty. My problem is once I get them, how do I turn it into something other than a hook up. I'm not the type of girl to hook up with people. I'm really shy and don't know how to conversate then them when we're one on one.  It's something I need to work on so please help...

20090222143801AAlu8mU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Flirty birthday text to an ex?	It's my ex's birthday on February 28th, and I still really like him (after 5 years). We met up last week and my friend thought he was still fond of me.      Anyway, I usually give him a happy birthday text! The thing is, I really don't know what to write.      I want to be friendly, but I want to have a bit of a flirt in it aswell.. but not be too flirty and scare him off! My friend suggested "I would give you birthday bumps" but I thought that might be a bit cheesy and pushing it too far. What do you guys think?      I was wondering if anyone has any flirty things I could say in this happy birthday text? (We dont live near eachother anymore, hence the break up, and he is currently single)
