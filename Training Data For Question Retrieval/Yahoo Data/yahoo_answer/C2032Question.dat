Im thinking of buying some turntables in the $200-$250 range for each of them and i cant decide between Stanton or Numark turntables. I am leaning towards the Numark TT200. I read some pretty good reviews about numark turntables (especially the TTX1 which alot of people who have formerly used Technic 1200s say that they like the TTX1s better). However while browsing the site djdeals.com i noticed that they sell numark products but they state that they do not reccomend numark products. So im just wondering if Numark stuff is reguarded as junk, or if this site is just out to make a buck, so they dont recommend cheaper stuff so they can sell you more expensive stuff. Thanks for any help.

I've had my mini for 2 years now and has basically crapped out totally: click weel barely works, the >> (next button) doesn't even "click", and now songs skip constantly sometimes by just changing song, or lowering volume, or even just basic movement like walking. My video iPod (30GB) is excactly a year old now and didn't even last me 6-months. I was just listening to it one day and it completly FROZE during a song. I looked more into that and found out its a hardware problem. Anyone experience that? I guessing the mini was a defect from the begining. It was the 1st generation mini (6GB). I also never bought them at a Apple store. I purchased my mini at Comp USA and my video at Costco Wholesale Club. I also never bought the $50 insurance for them, which I am so wishing I did. Getting them repaired is as much as a new iPod, so why bother getting them fixed after this long. So, what to do?

I need a camera for a school project that shoots decent quality video, has a USB thingy so I can plug it in the computer for editing.  I was hoping for something on the cheaper side and probably something that can hold memory sticks or has a large hard-drive or something that would let me hold lots of video.  I kinda would like it to be on the cheaper side but $700 would probably be my limit.

20081109213235AAomh9q	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PC	Can I Run GTA 4 On My PC ?	Hey, I just went on System Requirements lab and realized the only problem I could find was in my PC, its the processor.      They Say      Minimum: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8GHz, AMD Athlon X2 64 2.4GHz   Recommended: Intel Core 2 Quad 2.4GHz, AMD Phenom X3 2.1GHz   You Have: 2 processors running - Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.80GHz      CPU Speed:   Minimum: 1.8 GHz   Recommended: 2.4 GHz   You Have: 2.79 GHz      So.... I am quite sure that its that Dual Core (64bit factor); disregarding that, should I presume that the processor wont be able to run the game at all and expect problems ??   Need a reply on this with a strong base on why you think my processor may or may not be able to run the GTA IV game.       SO main question is can GTA4 run on 32bit Processors / or it needs Dual Core or better to work ? BTW: if so then I will just go on and upgrade my Graphics card as I am not much of a gamer

20080708200106AAV2N7R	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Bioshock question about how to find little sisters?	I can't remember which level it's called. (It's towards the end of the game where all the apartments are at....Tenenbaum's, abandoned apartment, etc.)  There are 2 little sisters (I think) in the level.  I found 1, and when I found the second one, I killed the Big Daddy.  However, when the little sister ran up to the Big Daddy, and I went to harvest her, a splicer killed me.  When I respawned at the vita-chamber, the dead Daddy was there, with no little sister.  The Big Daddy eventually respawned, but with no little sister with him.  I killed every Big Daddy in the level, and when they respawn, no little sister.  The pause menu still says I have one more to get.  Where the #$#@ is she?  I've heard of them coming out of hiding places to the respawned Daddies, but I haven's seen them.  Do I need to follow a Daddy for a while, or what?      Thanks in advance.

20081021180327AABYrCA	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 HD Signal isn't coming through...help?	I have the original Pro Version of the 360, with the HD Component AV Cable.  It used to play at 1080p fine, then one day the TV wouldn't give out a video signal, only audio.  First i thought it was the TV (Sharp Aquos Gaming 32" 1080p) , so I sent it in for repair, but it was confirmed to be functioning properly.  So either the Consoles video processor has gone bad, or the AV cable is damaged.  I want to think the cable is damaged, because that's easy to replace, but it seems unlikely since the cable does give out 480i signal, which is what I've been playing with for awhile.  Any suggestions or comments would be much appreciated. PS. my 2 year xbox warranty is over so i don't really want to turn it in for repair.

I'm trying to sync a video to my iPod, and it's in mp4 format, but when I click sync, it says it cannot copy it to my iPod because it can't play it. I find this odd, because I've synced other mp4 videos fine, but the last two I've tried have said this. I tried a different one and it worked fine, but this video and the one before it refuses to sync, even though it's mp4. I know for a fact I have enough space. I've been through the iPod Rs for troubleshooting, but it's still saying the same thing. Is there something I'm missing?? Why isn't it working? :( Does anyone have any idea, or had the same problem?

En 2002 compré en México un SIEMENS S40. Lo usé hasta 2004 cuando mi perro destruyó la entrada del cargador. No encontré el cargador pues el teléfono fue descontinuado y ya no se vendian los cargadores.       Ahora vivo en Holanda (tengo servidor KPN y un celular Samsung) y finalmente encontré el cargador adecuado para mi clásico s40 pero me aparece el letrero de Bloqueo por el servidor. Ya escribi a Telcel pidiendo ayuda pero no he recibido respuesta.      No cuento con más información del teléfono o el chip más de lo que viene escrito en ellos 350077807499870, pero desafortunamente no soy muy conocedora del tema y no sé qué más podría hacer para reavivar mi viejo teléfono, si es posible. O creen que mejor debo tirarlo?      Espero me puedan ayudar. Gracias.

There is obviously a problem with this tv and Mitsubishi has you call their indonesian customer service reps and give you a 3-4 hour run around and still will not get the service providers there to repair this TV.  We were basically told when the warranty is up, we would have a $2000 paperweight. Any suggestions?
