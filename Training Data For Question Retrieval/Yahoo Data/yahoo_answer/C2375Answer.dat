But other wise you will  need a degree, but you have two choices:<br>   Do a degree which may last 2-3 years in a particular subject that you like or enjoy or have an interest in, and then you could go on to do a further year on a PGCE course. Or you could go and do a Teaching degree which might last 3 or 4 years, both may take up a similar time period. There are advantages and disadvantages: The teaching degree will teach and prepare you more about teaching, but if you did a degree first before doing a pgce, you could study something like maths or science or english as these are sought after subjects and you may be paid more for being specialised in a subject like this. It also makes a difference whether you want to teach in primary schools or secondary ( as primary you teach all subjects, secondary you would teach the subject you had trained in> <br>  In order to get onto either of these courses, you would need other qualifications such as A' levels<br>  I'd also advise you to try and get some voluntary work in schools to see if you like it and it will help towards getting on to a programme of study and show that you are committed.<br>  Good luck|`|56aae78e821fccc8bfcd71a99569cf29aa	all the official info is at<br>  www.tda.gov.uk/Recruit.aspx

It has a broad range of forms, such as music, literature, and painting. Art is mostly known for letting people express themselves in many ways(for example, Picasso's Blue Period). People with any amount of skill or creativity can take art, since it is mostly about who you are that essentially creates art. Art has no limitations in color, shape, size, or inspiration. Even if a person doesn't wish to be an artist when they grow up, art encourages imagination and soul as well as planning and logic. What ever art is created has value, so whatever you make in art class, it will have a special place in your heart and living room. Thank You.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Art is a form of communication like speech, photographs, plays, poems, or films.

K2ecmzInaa	Because you were so nice, I'm just going to leave this here:<br>  <br>  Take a look around at the various people in the world today. Notice anything different about each person? Perhaps they have the same type of trends, but has anyone ever wondered about why they all have separate personalities from each other? One’s genetic makeup helps determine personality. However, there are other factors; sometimes metaphysical and astrological, which play into the overall construction of someone’s personality. Because of the numerous variables, people have different characteristic traits causing different personalities. Yet, the question still remains: where do personalities originate? To further explore this question, it is important to understand Astrology and corresponding planets.|`|AA12095483	It's an interesting intro - but I'm surprised at the topic you have chosen. Astrology isn't usually taught in school, nor is is usually recognized as a science by any except astrologers.

Well done.|`|6Nq3HKjYaa	sounds perfecto to me :)|`|fSn4KSuPaa	yeah its good! but the end was unclear. planets? like.. mars or something? sounds interesting! lol|`|XBH61aAIaa	If you look at the people around us in the world today you will notice similarities and differences in each person. People follow the same trends, listen to the same music and engage in the same activities, but they all have different personalities. Hereditary genes provide a biological basis for parts of your personality, but that is not the only factor that makes up someone’s personality. Past experiences take a major role, but so do the planets, stars and the galaxy. People have many different characteristics and personality traits. The real question is, where are personalities originated? You can simply look to astrology, planets and the world around us for the answer!|`|mwAPwTHDaa	i like it, just explain what you mean by how the planets play a big role in personality, and don't just make "The planets play a major role when it comes to personality." jump out to the reader so suddenly, take it slowly and carefully.|`|0KhNOmggaa	uh?<br>  what|`|axbmfP6qaa	You need grammatical help.............<br>  Get rid of "Take A" <br>  Sub them for "person".<br>  Sentence 3 is ?? look trends up in the dictionary<br>  Drop "why" in sen3<br>  Sen5 put an "a" before personality and after it add a comma then, the planets play a major role. drop the rest of this sentence.<br>  Drop comma after traits.<br>  Last sentance doesn't make sense, maybe something like...background of Astrology and how it relates to the Planets.<br>  It's not too bad but read it out loud or have someone read it to you and you'll hopefully get the drift that some of it doesn't make sense.|`|yN6seKAIaa	Look around. Have you noticed the varitey of people standing around you? Notice anything different about each person? Perhaps they have the same type of trends, but has anyone ever wondered about why they all have separate personalities from each other? Heredity provides a biological basis for personality, but it is not the only factor that makes up personality. The planets play a major role when it comes to personality. Many people have different characteristic traits, as well as different personalities, but the real question is: Where have these personalities originated? In order to answer this question it is important to learn the basic background of Astrology as well as Planets.<br>  <br>  This is good but make it a bit more interesting...<br>  <br>  College Proffeser from UM

I had a teacher call me stupid in front of the whole class one time.  My parents wrote her a letter saying they were going to take it up with the school.  It changed her attitude real quick.  Teachers have no right to insult students.  On the other hand, if you are misbehaving you are really bringing it down on yourself.  Some teachers are strict. They say to keep quiet, keep quiet.|`|AA11877042	Well first thing maybe she just hates your attitude. Are you the kind of person that always misbehave in her class?

QuUoDkBLaa	It would totally depend on what universities you want to go to/apply for.<br>  I guess most, if not all, of the universities would require psychology.<br>  <br>  Leeds university for example says any three A2 subjects from the following:<br>  'Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography and Psychology.'<br>  <br>  However you may also find that some universities only require psychology.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly, your school is a little harsh and non-flexible if students are not always allowed to study the subjects they want to as it could restrict their options later on in life.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Who takes Biology and Chemistry in the same year?  You need to talk to your counselor to steer you right.  In the United States there is usually a set course for college preparatory classes so the timetable problem is not an issue.

6qsocyK3aa	A Level English Literature is heavy going. I can't speak for History because I never took it, but in A Level English you have to do a lot of "reading around". We did stuff on war and we had to read about 8 books or something. Two we did in class but the others were up to us. It's not like in GCSE English Lit where you're given a book to read (which you usually read in class anyway from what I remember) and that's that. I can't speak for history because I never took it, but I wouldn't know what looks better or worse on a CV. Both are "classic" subjects ie. not Media or Photography which are often deemed useless these days.|`|UE07ucqWaa	well their both really hard subjects - i'm taking english lit now - i'm doin coursework on 2 books, coursework: creative wrighting - all the teachers said was that we should be reading as much as we can... and an exam on a play and an exam on poems.<br>  <br>  history is a lot of work - i'd suggest taking English - English tends to be a very usful A-Level|`|gHcinQkCaa	you do have to read a lot.  hence why its called English literature :P  do what will help you more in the future.  just dont, dont, DONT do maths.  my brain hurts cos of a level maths :(
y4CXrGTVaa	A "W" on your transcript looks much better than a "F" and should not, unless you continue to drop a lot of classes, impact your chances at graduate school.|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	Well if it says it'll show up as "W"...<br>  Then it probably will.<br>  <br>  At my college we don't have just a "W" we have "WP" which is withdraw passing and "WF" which is withdraw failing.<br>  <br>  The first month of the semester, if you drop the class it doesn't show up at all on transcripts. After that it becomes "WP" and you get no credit. If you withdraw in the last month of the semester you get a "WF" and get no credit, but it shows on the transcript that you basically failed the class.<br>  <br>  So chances are it'll show up as "W". There's no problem in having a "W" on your transcript, but having an F on your transcript will look much worse.<br>  <br>  I'd say to drop it if it's really that bad. But if it's a required math then you should get a tutor and keep at it because dropping the class in the middle of the semester would be stupid because you'd just have to take it all over again.|`|jqbC4tlpaa	This hasn't happened to me,but I do know that if you have a "W", that looks better than a failing grade. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|5c936a54fb80e00b663741498162c091aa	I never once met an awful teacher or professor so sorry that happened, its soooo rare though.|`|a42JpX2uaa	What are you going to go to graduate school for, and what do you want to become?  You may be worrying about nothing, hopefully.  I went to graduate school for history and education.  Getting into grad school isn't really as difficult in some situations as getting some financial help to go with it.  In my history program, some of the top kids won some financial assistance.  Many others got in, however, with gpas less impressive than yours.  It also depends what school you want to get into.<br>  <br>  edit:  I forgot about something else.  In my school, and yours could be totally different, we had an unusual rule.  If you failed a class, once during your career there you could retake the class and replace the grade.  I was having a semester like your with a horrible teacher.  I failed the class on purpose instead of taking a C, and then I retook the class over winter break with a great teacher and had an A.  My gpa never reflected the F.  I don't know how common this rule is, but check into it.  Good luck.|`|rpRzeGN5aa	First of all, this doesn't mean you're stupid. Chinese is one of the hardest languages to learn, and math in college--especially whe you have a bad teacher--can be very hard.<br>  You should take a W. Absolutely. Think of how it'll look to an employer OR a grad school: 1. You get a D or an F in the class. Looks really bad no matter what. 2. You get a W on your transcript. An employer/school could look at that and they wouldn't know that you were just doing badly...for all they know, you could have had family issues or other issues or stress that led you to drop the class.<br>  Just make sure you do it before the deadline, if there is one.|`|8Raw4M1naa	First and foremost, calm down! College can be super stressful, and if you let it run you over, you'll never enjoy the experience. You have a few options.<br>  <br>  Some schools do not show a W grade and some do. It just shows that you withdrew from the class, not failed. A W will still look better than an F.<br>  <br>  Also, if you do end up failing a class, never fear! Some colleges offer whats refered to as "forgiveness." If you fail a class, you can retake that same course and replace the original grade with the new one, and the first one is replaced by the new one. It makes it so the F does not appear on your GPA. I am not sure if it shows up on an offical transcript or not.<br>  <br>  Make sure to go talk to your academic advisor or a counselor on campus. Tell them you are feeling really overwhelmed and what you can do to correct it. Your first year will always be your hardest, so keep it up and you'll be fine. Just relax and have a little fun sometimes too.|`|AA11487579	If you're as stressed as you seem to be, and you're expecting to truly fail that math class, and you will have a gradeless W appear on your transcript for that class, I'd think you'd be best off dropping.<br>  <br>  But, if you have time (and the desire), I'd advise you talk to your math professor. He might be able to help you more in his office hours than he does in the classroom, and he might be willing to cut you some breaks like letting more of your grade be based on the final exam or something like that.<br>  <br>  Especially when you're in your first semesters of college, things can become overwhelming quickly. Dropping obviously has its consequences, but so does stressing about a class and then failing it. Good luck.|`|DibzbnVhaa	Consider getting a tutor that should be big help, to find a tutor simply just go on craigslist or ask your school. About dropping the class... you much rather get a W grade over a F, D, or even C grade. the W simply means that you could not no longer take that class for whatever reason, 2-3 W's are ok, anything more than that will make other schools second guess your dedication to school work. If you are receiving Financial Aid you will have to pay for the classes yourself.
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Non-degree students pay to take classes and can get credit for them, but are not working towards a degree from that university - so even if you took all the classes you needed for a degree, they wouldn't give you one.  You don't need to apply and get accepted to take classes as a non-degree student.
y4CXrGTVaa	If this is in regard to applying to college than no it does not matter if you apply as undeclared. <br>  <br>  However, somethings you might want to consider when picking a major is:<br>  <br>  1. What do you enjoy studying <br>  2. What type of career do you see yourself working in|`|owjZhOOhaa	no it does not look bad because most people change their major one or twice while they are in college. since you think you may like the sciences/medicine take some classes concentrating on that and squeeze in some introductory photography classes as an elective to see which one you would rather major in.|`|5c936a54fb80e00b663741498162c091aa	What I recommend to everyone who is undecided to go in as undecided and the first semester or the first year to take classes in different majors that seem the most interesting. Do not worry about graduation requirements.  That way you get to decide which classes you like the most.<br>  Also, who says one should go to college right away? You have your entire life for college. I did not start college till i was 25 and I am very happy that I chose to have a life before signing my life away to college and work. At 18 years old I was not ready for "commitment" and I did not know what I wanted to major in. Travel the world a bit, just find yourself. When I was in high school I had several ideas of what I wanted to do "maybe I would go into teaching, maybe business" but never 100% sure. Having lived life a bit I am 100% sure what I want to do now and my college experience is by far more valuable. I also have awesome job experience and while other college students are working in Starbucks or the mall I am already working in the field that I want to get into (social work) and they paying for my college.<br>  <br>  I have tons of friends who went to college straight from high school, rarely anyone is working in the field they majored in. They are also in so much debt. You really do not want to be 22 years old and owe $50,000, not much freedom to do what you want when you are forced to get a job to pay for debt.

You need to request testing in writing from your school district. and especially now, districts don't have a lot of money so you may really have to advocate to get your son services. Consider contacting an attorney. There are also Special Education Advocacy organizations that could provide low-cost or free help. Good Luck. I know this info is correct in California, but the laws may differ state by state, but they should be pretty similar.|`|jhjn1QVQaa	First of all, you need to take your child to another doctor for a second opinion, or to a specialist.

I'm an education major about to graduate and I've observed several special education classrooms where there were children as young as three years old.  This is what the website states:<br>  <br>   (a) In General.--The Secretary shall provide grants under this section to assist States to provide special education and related services, in accordance with this part--<br>  <br>  (1) to children with disabilities aged 3 through 5, inclusive; and<br>  <br>  (2) at the State's discretion, to 2-year-old children with disabilities who will turn 3 during the school year. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://idea.ed.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://idea.ed.gov/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|87bf667fea333b3c8139795c29592dbeaa	i have a child with speech delay and i am sorry that you are having such a hard time with some one to help you out here what state are you in because your state is suppose to help you out no matter how much money you make because i have been right in your shoes where you feel like there is no where else for you to turn speak with your doctor and ask him or her , to get you into a developmental pediatrician they can really help you out with a wide range of things and it sounds to me that you might need another doctor good luck and if you need any help please just ask me.|`|tbEjs8N2aa	Your child is school age and should be able to access the help he needs through your local school district - of course how easy all this is depends on where you are. If you don't know where to start I would check your county's website - most have a department dedicated to children with special needs or disabilities. Someone will be able to point you in the right direction and get you in touch with the right people. As far as your Pediatrician, I have found from personal experience and from hearing it from other parents, that your Pediatrician is there to make sure you child is physically well as far as major organs, growth, weight, etc - if you want an opinion on his development you need to visit a Pediatric Behavioral/Developmental Pediatrician. These doctors look beyond what your Pediatrician will. Contact your health insurance company first and make sure you do what you have to first like finding a participating doctor in your plan and getting a referral if you need one. Best of luck to you.

Its just soo much corruption  and if you have a hear you really prefer to not know those goes on.<br>  <br>  Where you have your internship means nothing, what you do is what matters. Choose the internship where you would have the best opputunity to do the job you want. I know interns that work at very prestigious companies and are making photo copies all day, other interns that work for a not so well known company and is working on real projects that actually matter...trust me saying you worked on so and so project looks much better than "I answered phone and made coffee all semester"

yJSPecgoaa	I can find only one well-known one:<br>  <br>  “I'm not trying to sell sex. I just don't like wearing a lot of clothes onstage.”<br>  <br>  The rest of these "quotes" are just comments she made in an interview.  [Jon Bream, Star Tribune (Minneapolis) (MCT) 27 June 2008] :<br>  <br>  “We don’t rehearse because we just play by ear. That’s what’s so cool because it’s very spontaneous.”  <br>  <br>  Of Prince: <br>  “Musically, we have a bond, we understand each other.”  There’s times we get out of the way and sometimes we get in each other’s way. But I think the respect that we have for each other works.” <br>  <br>  On Growing Up: <br>  “We grew up listening to [my dad, Pete Escovedo] play around the house. He practiced to records all the time. And if his band wasn’t rehearsing, they’d have jam sessions in our living room all the time. So pretty much the percussion instruments - timbales, congas, bongos hand toys - were set out in the house as part of the furniture most of the time.” <br>  <br>  On her first solo, at age 15: <br>  “It was an overwhelming experience because I’d never been able to express myself in that way....“To be onstage with 16 musicians in a band signed to CBS in front of 3,000 people, for me, it was as if there was an out of body experience. If this is what heaven was supposed to feel like, then I wanted to feel like this every day. When I was done, I opened my eyes and the people were roaring and a standing ovation. I don’t remember the solo. I looked at Pops and he looked at me and his mouth had just dropped open."<br>  <br>  <br>  From another interview:<br>  <br>  On what a diva is:   <br>  "I always thought that a lot of women made ‘diva’ really bad. But to me, a true diva in a good sense is someone like Patti Labelle and Gladys Knight. Those are the ones who have paved the way; they’ve been here forever and are still singing and performing like they’re fifteen years old. The most important thing about being a diva is staying humble in the way that you present yourself and the way you talk to people. I’ve seen so many ugly things. I never wanted to be a diva – ever – because I saw, most of the time, divas create such madness. I didn’t want to be a part of that."<br>  <br>  On being a female percussionist:<br>  "I’ve never been intimidated by anyone. Ever. I think that’s been instilled in me because of my parents. First of all, I didn’t even know that there was a gender factor placed on playing drums and percussion, because for me it was so natural. As a family, we just gathered together and played. The drums were part of the furniture in the house. It was not a big deal until I started becoming a professional musician at fifteen and flying to Los Angeles from Oakland, California, coming out here to do session work with other musicians. They looked at me like I was crazy. I thought “Why?” and didn’t understand that it was a unique situation. The first couple of women that I noticed, that performed and who I looked up to – one was Karen Carpenter. When I first saw her play on her television show I thought to myself “Oh my God, I could do that! I should be on TV too!” It just inspired me. And there was a percussion player a long time ago, who played with Bob Dylan. Her name was Bobbye Hall. She was the only other [female] percussion player I knew, besides my mom."<br>  <br>   <br>  Sorry that this is all I could find for you.
SC5t5cUVaa	How about a lip gloss fund raiser! Have fun raising funds!<br>  <br>  I have used this before to help a friend of mine raise money for her local Autism Group.<br>  <br>  I am an Arbonne Consultant and I get a 35% discount on the products I purchase to sell. Arbonne has these 6 great lip glosses that cost $10.00 USD Retail.   I also include  Arbonne  Lip  Saver for the guys and the gals.(SPF8 Chapstick). Priced at $8.00 US. <br>  <br>  This makes the fund raiser fun and simple. Just 7 products and each sold earns $3 for the fundraising cause. I also work into the program rewards for each of the sellers if they reach certain sales goals. <br>  <br>  Where do you live? Arbonne can be sold out of the US , Canada, UK, and Australia. So this should work for any of these locations or if you live another place, I just need to look at the shipping cost of the products.<br>  <br>  Anyway it is very fun and really can create a nice amount of money for the cause.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  10 Members each sell 30 Lip Gloss = 300 Sold 300 x $3.00 = $900.00<br>  ($3.00 earned for each sold)<br>  <br>  Plus each member that can sell 30 or more will get $50.00 in Arbonne Product Free as a bonus.  Arbonne has over 400 products.<br>  <br>  It is easy to sell.  Great colors and many ladies will buy 2 different colors or one lip gloss and the lip saver.<br>  <br>  Email me through my profile if you would like more information.<br>  <br>  Take care, <br>  Karen|`|LVZdzPmpaa	This would take some planning and forethought but it has enormous potential: Have a huge "garage sale" on the school property. Send notices home with every student and ask for donations from garages, closets, basements. Do this about thirty days ahead. Arrange for people to drop off all day Wednesday and Thursday before the sale. Organize and price things on Friday. Open the sale to the public Saturday from, say, 9:00 - 3:00. Depending on the response, you might even be able to charge a dollar or two admission.|`|CZsjZCzVaa	gift wrapping look into sally foster on line..........you can make 50% of the profits.|`|E7GowZFRaa	you can talk to local restaurants to get a commission on the food sold on a certain night, or have a bowling night or something like that. you could also host a dance or party and pay for admission

1nMeOUnbaa	I have the same problem when I have to present something in a class. I think the best thing to do is to have confidence in yourself, and try to really get into what you are doing so that everyone around you (including the professor) is out of your mind.  If you are good at what your doing and you know it, and if you can just try to concentrate as much as you possibly can on just playing your music, Then I think that will make it much easier.  Concentrate, but try to relax at the same time, remember, if you do mess up, its not the end of the world. That's why you're in class. Just take a deep breath and go for it. I know that's common advice but it helps me. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  **btw thanks for answering my question about the poem, I would've picked you best answer but my question got deleted for some reason...don't know why....<br>  Anyway, just thought I'd say that.
AA10023710	That's such a tough situation. But if you must study abroad, and if, in the end, your doing so is going to benefit you and your family, then... But be sure you need to do this. <br>  <br>  Make sure to devote some extra time to your family both before, and after your time away. See if you can find some way to get some help for your wife for while you're away - a family member who can give her an hour or two off, once a week - even that much would be helpful. <br>  <br>  As the other poster said, use Skype and other web-based services to stay in close touch with your family, ideally including live visuals, so your daughter can see you. Send photos, and have photos sent to you. Send presents and letters. Treat your wife *very* well both during and after this time. Taking care of a 22 month old alone is a huge deal. Be extremely kind. <br>  <br>  And honestly, investigate additional study abroad opportunities, perhaps through a university that is not the one where you are studying, and see if you can find a shorter program. NYU, for example, offers a lot of study abroad programs, of varying lengths. All are open to students from other schools. I think BU does this as well. <br>  <br>  But in the end, you need to decide what's best for you and your family. And if this program will set you up the best, then do what you can to lessen the impact on your family while you're gone, and go the extra mile with them once you return.|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	Keep in mind that the world is a very small place these days...use the internet...telephones, cell phones, if that's feasible....send photos of yourself.  Keep TONS of photos to show her when you return...bring gifts.  SKYPE.  set up skype before you go...make sure you have a webcam and everything set up so that you know it will work, and take a laptop if possible, so you can actually TALK AND SEE her on the computer and she can see you.<br>  <br>  Just wondering, why did you choose to do this now?

If there assignments were listed as incompletes and it's the teacher's fault she forgot to tell you about them; shouldn't you be able to work something out with her? An F in a core class would probably be enough reason to revoke a scholarship. I suggest you 1) talk to you teacher about working something out 2) explain your situation to the college/foundation/person/whoever that is giving you the scholarship 3) try not to take a vacation for an entire week of school without clearing what is to be expected/due/assigned for when you return.

Leave Thursday or Friday for redos.

You set your own schedule and it is self paced. You are required 21.5 credits and you have to get above a 70% on a course to receive a credit, or you will have to take it again. The experience was great. I am fourteen and I obtain my high school diploma, it only took me 5 months and a few days to finish the whole program. I am taking college courses online, to advance my education. Your mother doesn't have to be home, for you to do homeschooling through Penn Foster. I honestly loved being home schooled, and you learn at your own pace instead of being rushed through something and not understanding it. My schedule was<br>  <br>  6:45 am - Wake up and jump into the shower. <br>  7:30 am - Breakfast time. <br>  7:50 am - School<br>  11:30 am - Take a break, and eat lunch. <br>  12:00 - Back to school work<br>  1:50 pm - Finish up work, and My mental school bell rings<br>  2:10 pm - Exercise time<br>  2:40 pm - Hang around for the rest of the day, spending time with friends, phone, tv, internet, reading, whatever I wanted to do. <br>  <br>  need any other information, email me<br>  lovergrrl101@yahoo.com|`|QwpRD7DUaa	1. they say she does, but it doesn't matter if she's home.<br>  <br>  2. some of the work is easy, some is hard, it all depends.<br>  <br>  3. i've been homeschooled since october & i still don't have a schedule i actually pay attention to /: but this week i've started one.<br>  <br>  7:00-wake up<br>  7:10-excercise<br>  9:00-school<br>  12:00-lunch<br>  12:30-school.<br>  3:00schools out.<br>  <br>  school - is when i do work<br>  <br>  and i exercise because since your homeschooled &<br>  don't switch classes and stuff, you should too :D<br>  <br>  4. let me know if you need any help :D<br>  <br>  5. im pretty sure it's like 20-22 credits, something like that.<br>  <br>  good luck & hope i helped :D
s8QbZ0RLaa	Home schooling is when your parents teach you. You'd need a curriculum so you'd have to buy books. So, no, it's not free.<br>  <br>  If you want to do online schooling, then it would be free through a public school. This is one example: <a href="http://www.mdlp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdlp.org/</a><br>  <br>  It depends on where you are located. Ask your school to see if they do an online program or do a google search for an online school in your area.<br>  <br>  Edit: To below respondent: I see what you're saying. I took a couple online classes while being home schooled, but if you're doing your entire schooling online, it is referred to online schooling or cyber schooling.<br>  From Wiki:<br>  "Online schools and educational resources can improve the quality of homeschooling and make it more accessible.[citation needed] Online resources for homeschooling include courses of study, educational games, online tests, online tutoring, and occupational training. Online learning potentially allows students and families access to specialized teachers and materials and greater flexibility in scheduling. Parents can be with their children during online tutoring session. Finally, online tutoring is useful for students who are disabled or otherwise limited in their ability to travel."<br>  <br>  Those are resources. If you're entire education comes from an online school, you are no longer home schooling. You are in the public school system.|`|3OlUzzumaa	k-12.com<br>  <br>  I agree with Kootoni-sama. Connections Academy seems like such an amazing school. I wanted to do that school so bad my freshman year of high school but they didn't have 9th grade yet in my state and I was bummed about that so I had to go and do another school called BSO. It's ok not the best. In my eyes Connections Academy is the best online school I've found thus far.|`|AA11674101	In the state of Georgia the Georgia Virtual Academy is free. Good luck.|`|ENbE1Hi2aa	Virtual Schools are neither free nor homeschooling.  They are paid for by the taxpayer and must meet the same requirements as any other PUBLIC school.  Virtual schools are public schooling in your home at taxpayer expense.  You do not have the independence of choosing what you want to study and learn about but must follow whatever public school curriculum is required and take whatever state testing is required of public schools.    <br>  <br>  Homeschooling can be independent and free using the resources of the Internet and public library.  Independent homeschoolers are exempt from state testing under NCLB.   It can also be very inexpensive if you buy used curriculum, for example, at a homeschool curriculum fair or on eBay.  You can find out more by contacting your states' secular homeschool group, they will help you get started.|`|LsAArkUyaa	Virtual Charter Schools such as GA virtual Academy, and Connections academy are not homeschooling.

Homeschooling is not always when parents simply teach you. I'm home schooled and have been for the past 4 years, since 7th grade. The school I am in has actual teachers who have actually taught classes and now teach students virtually.<br>  <br>  The school is called Connections Academy. It goes from K-12. The 12th grade was included this year I think. The school is fantastic, books - most supplies and even computers are provided if needed. You have classes everyday, you can speak with the teacher's for weekly phone calls and check-up's with school work progress, you get graded just as you would in a normal school and more.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are other home-schooling programs that are free, so you might want to look into other ones, but connections is worth a try.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.connectionsacademy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.connectionsacademy.com/</a><br>  <br>  Here's the site if you wish to check it out!
rTaaIXSuaa	Your best bet right now is homeschool.<br>  You will still be able to hang out with your friends. That doesn't change. My daughter went throught the same things that you are going through and she still hangs out with her friends when school lets out.|`|0Jxkioh2aa	You should be homeschooled, I went through the same thing at my public school, and i was getting c's in school. As soon as I became homeschooled, all my grades went up to A's, and sometimes it's a little bit lonely, but you just have to balance seeing friends after school and doing things on weekends, or finding friends who are a bit older and have graduated. Other than that, it was the best decision I ever made, and I extremely enjoy it. It also opens other opportunities if you ever want to work part-time during the day or anything. Hope this helps :)|`|BzvBMsBCaa	Being home schooled should not interfere with your friendships. Your friends will still call you and invite you to the activities that you have always enjoyed together. My advice would be to look up your local home school support group and find someone your age to talk it over with. In our small town the homeschoolers have at least one field trip or fun day a month and in the nearest city they have many weekly activities for the different age groups. Boredom hasn't been a problem for any of the home schooled kids I know. It is a more relaxed way to learn and no homework means you may even have more time for the fun stuff. There are many different ways to home school and the first step is to get an idea of wich type is right for you, unschooling (unschooling.com), enrollment or registration, (traditionallearning.com has a good explanation of the difference) or maybe an independent curriculum, Waldorf is wonderfully creative (live-education.com). Discuss the options together with wichever adult will be supervising your education and find out exactly what you expect from eachother. Good luck.|`|VBBM61baaa	that is a very common assumption made by public schoolers, if youre homeschooled there's no "socialization". its very false. i was homeschooled for 6 years and public schooled for 6. i preffered homeschooling. i was also bullied in public school so i know where ur coming from. <br>  i had plenty of friends from both public school and homeschooling, u can find homeschool groups to do things with. u still have fun lol i promise. u do field trips, do pe, music and debate, speech...or just get together to have fun. theres plenty to do.<br>  also, when i went from homeschooling to public school, i was so much farther ahead in my education than people my age. i was bored in public school.<br>  (and i had more free time and plenty of freedom...i was even able to get a part time job during school hours because i was available lol)|`|NHjFaeTLaa	home school you wont get bullied and you can see your friends after school finishes|`|GSCD9vq3aa	home school

lQIKWXDuaa	There are 12-24 months accelerated nursing programs. At the end you will earn your BSN degree. Th other option is to enter a direct master's degree program to become a nurse practitioner. The programs range from 2-4 years long. For the social work, I will recommend applying to get your master's degree in that. You can spend two extra years in school and at the same time earn a higher degree which will earn you a higher paycheck.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you!!!!<br>  <br>  ss<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ss|`|AA10023710	If you want to be a social worker, you may be able to get into a masters degree program in social work, just as you are right now. I had a friend who'd studied theater for her BA, and went on for her MSW. You aren't required to have done a specific degree to enter an MSW program. You just need to have done about 18 credits of liberal arts courses while you were doing your bachelors. <br>  <br>  Nursing is a different story. If you want to be a nurse, you must have an undergraduate degree in nursing. But there are a *lot* of second bachelors degree nursing programs out there now. Since you already have a  degree, you'd only need to complete the courses required for the nursing major. You'd complete your BS in 1-2 years, depending on the speed of the program. Most nursing second bachelors programs do require that you take the following classes before you enroll: Human Nutrition, Medical Microbiology w. lab, Anatomy (2 semesters), physiology, stats, and human development. You can take those at a community college - they're pretty easy classes to find. Check directly with the second degree programs you're interested in, and make sure of their specific pre-req classes, and take them. <br>  <br>  Another option you may not have thought of - teaching. If you're in marketing, you probably are pretty good at math. You could become a math teacher. There's a lot of demand for that, and there are programs out there to help people with math acumen transition from business to teaching. If interested, you could check it out.|`|5tvM9T7vaa	If your degree came from an accredited university, then your gen-ed credits should carry.  When you decide what you want to do, try to see if there is a certificate program, like there is for nursing or teaching.  It's much less time, and sometimes can be taken as graduate credits toward a masters.  Whatever you decide, though, speak with a department chair and they can give you more specific instructions on what you need to do to accomplish your goals.<br>  <br>  GL!

Remove from the heat, cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove the vanilla bean and reserve for another use.<br>  <br>  In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and it just starts to lighten in color. Add the cream a little at a time, stirring continually. Pour the liquid into 6 (7 to 8-ounce) ramekins. Place the ramekins into a large cake pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake just until the creme brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, approximately 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.<br>  <br>  Remove the creme brulee from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top.

f977e51d2f4a930956e1926a9b567712aa	Everyone has different experiences with medical school.  Some people will tell you it is life consuming.  Others will say it is not that bad.  One thing most people agree on is that there is a massive amount of material thrown at you in a very short period of time.  That's one aspect of medical school that makes it so difficult.  My husband is a first year student.  I will tell you a little about his experience.  I am not trying to sway you either way here.  The choice to become a physician is one that you and only you can make.  My husband also has a huge desire to learn, as well as to help people.  He has wanted to be a doctor since he was young.  He began his medical studies this past August.  It has been challenging to say the least.  Many medical schools are different as far as class scheduling goes.  He is in school from 8-5 most days.  Many of his classes are attendance optional and they make the lectures available online if you miss any.  After he gets home, we have dinner together, and he begins studying.  He studies about 5 hours/day on weekdays, and 10-12 hours/day on weekend days.  It can be more on exam weeks.  I know that sounds horrible, but you learn how to accommodate, and value the free time you do have.  That being said, he does get some free time here and there.  He takes a couple hours off every week for family time, and occasionally he will take a weekend day off.  Also, he takes off a day after exams, if he doesn't have them back to back.  It was very difficult at first, especially with a young son, but we make it work.  Overall, he enjoys school.  He has his "burnt out" moments, and days where he wonders what he is doing here, but everyone does.  There's ups and downs when it comes to medical school.  He does say it is the hardest challenge he has ever faced, but also very worthwhile.  He couldn't see himself doing anything else.  If you truly want to become a physician, it is worth it.  I highly recommend you do lots of physician shadowing before applying.  Make sure it is what you want to do for the rest of your life.  Also, I recommend taking biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology in undergrad.  Usually these courses aren't required for admittance to most medical schools, but they can be some of the most demanding courses you will encounter.  Also, look at your options.  Look at all the aspects associated with medicine, not just schooling itself, but also residency, and lifestyle of physicians.  There are other careers in medicine that are rewarding, such as nursing, physician assistant, physical therapy, etc.  There are positives and negatives to each field.  It really comes down to what will be satisfying to you, and what will fit your lifestyle best.  Good luck!|`|edIUAbCxaa	it sounds hard to get into

AA10176626	I assume that you mean "only require a bachelor's degree", rather than any graduate or professional degree. Is that right?<br>  <br>  Obviously "professional athlete" would top any list like this, but I'm guessing that you're not a world-class tennis player, football star, or future hall of fame slugger.<br>  <br>  Of course, any list of the highest paying careers would start out with various medical specialists - anesthesiologists, orthodontists, surgeons - these are going to fill the top spots on the list. All of those require many years of schooling.<br>  <br>  Probably the highest paying career that does not require an advanced college degree would be airline pilot - they earn an average salary of about $148,000.<br>  <br>  Engineering managers would also rank high on the list, though some companies would probably only promote engineers with advanced degrees. The average engineering manager would earn about $115,000 a year. <br>  <br>  Petroleum engineers also do very well, though the jobs are quite physically challenging. They average about $114,000.<br>  <br>  Computer and Information Systems Mangers - again - many would have advanced degrees, but some companies will offer the opportunity to advance this high - they earn about $114,000 a year, too.<br>  <br>  Other high paying career choices: Marketing managers, air traffic controllers, and sales managers, all of whom have average incomes over $100,000.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that incomes are definitely tied to geography - you won't find many petroleum engineering jobs in Kentucky, and most positions pay better along the coasts, where the cost of living is generally much higher.<br>  <br>  Don't choose a job by how much you stand to earn - choose a job that you won't mind getting up and going to do every day for 40 years.<br>  <br>  I hope this information helped.|`|edIUAbCxaa	social worker, chp, doctor, dentist, etc. theres a lot of high paying jobs that require college|`|d36OrpbDaa	Do you mean, that only require a Bachelor's degree?<br>  <br>  There are a lot.

ukgDQsnKaa	Yes, I do.<br>  <br>  Reason 1: Teachers have as much or more education than most Attorneys. In fact of all the degree professions out there Teachers are the lowest paid. <br>  <br>  Reason 2: You get what you pay for. If we want our children to do better compare to other first world countries we need to pay our Teachers more.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|INCFl5gTaa	I honestly, don't think they're getting paid enough... I don't know how much public school teachers are getting paid, but I know that catholic school teachers get paid less-- and for what? Most the teachers don't even teach religion and are still paid less.<br>  These people shape the minds of children, and for that (IF they're doing their jobs correctly) should be paid a lot-- because it's a big deal! Just as a doctor or pharmacist (Who are paid a lot). His or her actions depend on a person's life. Make a wrong diagnosis on the person, or give someone the wrong medicine, can lead to injury or death. <br>  The same applies to teachers. If they teach the students wrong, there actions will eventually lead to wrong things. <br>  Point is- they're doing something very important in the community, and for that, it should be done correctly and lead to correct pay. These are the future generations of people, and that's a big deal. =O|`|VWnmOOS7aa	I think teachers SHOULD get paid more because they do so much work into helping children learn and get an education. That's a gift for life.|`|mYhuGonfaa	I think the important topic in the pay of teachers is the fact that some cities tend to overlook the actual cost of living in their area. What one teacher gets in Wyoming feels like a fortune, while a teacher receiving the exact same pay in California is living paycheck to paycheck.|`|uC1MHjK7aa	I think teachers definately should! They have one of the hardest and most important jobs in the world. They are teaching the kids of the future! Without teachers kids would not be in school and being educated, there for the would not have jobs, they would be poor etc. Teachers have a really important job and I think they should be payed a lot more than they do now. Also dealing with kids is very stressful. Especially if the kids don't care about learning.
Dh0JX2Onaa	I think that of the two classics is the far better choice./|`|akpe0bTBaa	Hi, If i was you i would take classics as if your ambition is to become a barrister then taking classics would really add a different aspect to your CV as barristers (Generally jobs in law) do not just look at the skills required but what else you can do. Also if you change your mind about being a barrister then still having classics down as a GCSE then broadens the scale for other jobs.<br>  <br>  However if you like P.E and you enjoy it more..then take it! Just because you do not do classics does not mean you cannot be a barrister. Having P.E down as a GCSE would push you in favor of being a barrister for people with sport cases too =)<br>  <br>  From my point of view (And i am a genius *cough*) you do not lose either way. Take what you will enjoy more as it will help you relax when your GCSEs come round<br>  <br>  Hope i helped.|`|4Ql5vKfraa	i know it doesn't seem this way, but GCSEs count for next to nothing. seriously, do what you enjoy, and get the 5 A-C grades required to get into college to do A-levels, where you can start thinking about it more seriously.

Use other work as a basis, as a guide; that's what academic books are for, but write in your own words.<br>  Yes, some work is checked for plagiarism, and if you're found guilty, you could be zero-marked; or, if it's particularly serious, you could be be thrown out of your studies.<br>  If it were up to me, using YA answers as a source for your work indicates mental instability, and I'd recommend counselling.|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	They check on sites that actually advertise to write entire essays... not the half baked, stab in the dark stuff we do! :-)
QRRD8THLaa	This depends on a number of things. The first question you need to get answered is which syllabuses are you taking at school now? How does this stack up against the syllabuses that <a href="http://www.oxfordhomeschooling.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfordhomeschooling.co.uk</a> offer. Where they are the same you will have a chance of being able to carry on from where you left off. <br>  <br>  Having said this, some syllabuses such as Maths are closely mapped against the National Curriculum and it really doesn't matter which syllabus you were taking.<br>  <br>  Others like English are such that you might be doing th same syllabus but the choices that Oxford Home Schooling have made are not the same as those you teacher has made.  An example would be OHS has chosen Macbeth and your previous teacher chose Hamlet.<br>  <br>  Have a word with a student adviser at Oxford Home Schooling, they should be able to help.

AA10176626	La:<br>  <br>  The Department of Education randomly selects 30% of all FAFSA submissions for verification every year. Congress made that a requirement of the financial aid program. Being selected is - in no way - a reflection on your responses - it's just a totally random thing. It could happen to you again next year, or, with any luck, it won't happen again. It's the luck of the draw.<br>  <br>  When the Department selects an application, they send your school a special notation along with your ISIR (Institutional Student Information Report) that says "you must perform a verification on this particular application". A school can not qualify you for any financial aid funds until the verification process has been completed. This applies to every school, so whatever school you wind up at, they will have to complete the verification.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps - good luck.|`|edIUAbCxaa	yes you do

lQIKWXDuaa	Ok. Nowadays an associate degree in certain fields are useless. My ex-boyfriend has a master's degree in ART and he cant find a job. In this bad economy time, I really think you should try to get at least a bachelors degree. You can go to a community college and then transfer to a four-year university after words. It is cheaper that way.  In the ART world, you really have to do internships at a museum, art gallery etc... You really need to network if you want to get your foot in the door. For this reason, I really recommend someone with an art major to pursue that degree in a school that has a lot to offer its student in terms of networking and outside of the classroom experience.<br>  <br>  Realistically, if an employer want to hire two people with equally wonderful portfolio, they will hire the person from the well known institute not the person from the community college.<br>  ss|`|AA10023710	It really depends on the community college, and on the strength of their art classes. Most of the ccs in my area are way too weak re: their art classes. Some of the graduates come out with strong enough portfolios, but many do not. He'd need to go in and be really motivated to his art, to work extra hard, and to not be satisfied with an A - he wants better. He should also do an internship in his field as he studies, perhaps over a summer, and also do as much graphic design work for real life customers as he can while he studies. He could, for example, do real life projects in his classes, and also do volunteer work for local charities, etc. <br>  <br>  It's not that employers won't respect that he went to a cc. So long as his portfolio is strong enough, he'll have just as much of a shot at a job as the next guy. It's his portfolio that's going to make or break his ability to get a job afterwards. So long as his portfolio is strong enough, he'll actually be fine. But if it's not strong enough, it's a real issue.|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	Being a designer requires talent that cannot always be taught. There are plenty of two year technical degrees that pay as well as most college graduates. An art degree is for self fulfillment only as it has no market value unless combines with something else. You can go on to a 4 year school from a community college but you still need the grades to do so.|`|x1QRh1H6aa	to me community college is worse than nothing.  I would rather hire a kid who came right out of high school and knew that he wasn't smart enough than some one who tries a CC and is probably stupider, you have two choices when coming out of high school, go to real college 4 years or go straight into a career, as some type of laborer. Case and point CC is pointless because you won't get a better job.|`|edIUAbCxaa	no, not really. you're only receiving an associates degree. nowadays, a bachelors degree is only entry level and so you'll need a higher degree than the bachelors if you want a good job.

My first name is Christopher, which is of Greek origin and means "bearing Christ inside," although I really am a doubting Thomas, who has serious reservations about Christianity as it is often practiced now in America.  My mother actually chose the name at random while reading a Reader's Digest shortly after I was born.  She closed the magazine, then reopened it, and vowed to give me the name of the first man she came upon in the publication.  Fortunately for me, it was Christopher Columbus.  So, technically, I'm named after the Italian explorer.  My middle name is William, which is of German origin and means "determined guardian or defender."  I like this name too because it was also the first name of my father, and the middle name of one of my paternal great-grandfathers, who was a highly respected medical doctor and activist for the Methodist Church in East Texas during the late 1800s, and who was actually of German ancestry.  The only drawback to the names is having to write them.  My entire name is just one letter shorter than the entire English alphabet, so I often feel like I'm getting writer's cramp when I sign an official document.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Yes, I do.

It's an endless circle of ugliness and more ugliness. so even if you complain right now, remember that the school is just trying to transform the girls into beautiful young woman, and they want you to be happy with how you look right now. :)|`|QRrURcQDaa	This is because it makes men (meaning male teachers also) and male students look at young girls differently. Which could distract teachers from teaching.

hJAtgbb8aa	Honey, it doesn't matter because everyone is weird.<br>  Weird are things that don't seem normal or common.<br>  Normal is a thing that has been set up by people cause we do it often.<br>  If there is something uncommon we do, we are called weird and freaks.<br>  Everyone does things that most people don't do. Some people likes things most people don't, and some find some things funny while most don't.<br>  That does not make anyone weird, or abnormal...it makes them "different" and being different is a good thing most of the time.<br>  So everyone is weird if we always compare things with what's normal and what isn't.<br>  <br>  So I won't say that you are weird...I'll say you find these funny while others don't.

aywKL2fmaa	We where off on the trail. It was one of the coldest nights in along time. I didn't quite understand why or even where we was going, the one thing I knew for sure was that we had along way to go. I didn't know where my father had gone so I started looking all around. Finally after what seemed like a very long time I found him, but not as I wanted to. There I was, watching as my fathers limp body dropped to the floor, his face white and cold as stone. He was struggling to get up, fighting for his life. Then all of a sudden he stopped moving, just laid there stiff as brick. My eyes filled with tears in horror I cried. I knew what was happening, I just didn't think it would turn out like this, I never wanted this to happen. As I turned over to tell my mother, in my horror she was also laying there on the cold floor limp and lifeless, just as my father. "Go with your brother to your uncle's. Keep safe and never forget, I love you!" My mother said in a whisper. "I love you too!" I replied, feeling as lifeless as them as I watched them dying knowing I could not do anything to save them. I also knew that this was the last time I would ever get the chance to hear my mothers voice.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I was of help!, I'm good at stories!|`|e7b0601032c4bbdaf8f307b4abdc26b2aa	Please do a grammar check and spell check first.

But then, I come from a rather conservative background (Mennonite).<br>  <br>  I think that if the person has genuine interest in teaching children, he/she should go for it. Just as long as they're not flaunting it. I wouldn't want ANY of my child's teachers discussing their sexual preferences/sex lives with my child regardless of age.|`|vSiD4dxMaa	no. i have a 16 year old friend that is a transsexual. it wouldn't bother me one bit.|`|015q1IKQaa	honey... it really won't matter. his sexuality has nothing to do with his teaching|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Honestly, I think it is entirely possible that transsexuals are in the schools teaching now and no one knows.  <br>  <br>  Personally I think it goes along the same lines as any other major belief system a teacher may have.  I don't think a teacher should indoctrinate or encourage children to practice something they believe that is not in the curriculum.  Just like you wouldn't want a teacher preaching to students or telling them how to download porn on their computer, it should be checked at the door.  I am sorry, but I think a child's education is more important than personal expression.|`|INCFl5gTaa	In a way, I'd feel a little weird about it. I'm only 15, not a parent, just thinking if I had children. But really, as long as he does his job the correct way, it's fine with me. What ever the teacher's choice was, was his....and her choice xD. <br>  Although it is weird-- that's a feeling, but as long as the feeling isn't expressed, that's also fine. You don't want to show that "eww, really?" feeling to him/her. And Nahh, it wouldn't matter the grade. Early grades wouldn't even understand, while later grades.....then again might be freaked out about it-- hey, how do you know that he's tran!! Although, you might be able to tell...<br>  <br>  Bottomline-- I would be fine about it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also, As long as the teacher really doesn't bring up the fact that he is Trans. That would just make him look weird, but also, yea-- that's abuse of a teacher's position if they persuade them. But what are the odds?......|`|lAZWTLtRaa	I've never had a transsexual teacher, but as long as they do their job and be a good teacher (follow the rules/laws) then I'd have no problem with it.<br>  They should be treated the same way as any other teacher, and not be discriminated against.<br>  <br>  I think that age matters only because you understand things better as you get older. <br>  Obviously a grade 6 and up student knows about transsexuals, and will be more sensitive about it (imagine a grade 1 finding out their mrs ____ is really a he. they;d probably blurt it out loud or accidentally say something rude -- they don't know any better).|`|mezX9Ao0aa	this would bother me a little bit...dont ask me why, it would just bother me. i think it would be funny if they taught sex ed, get it SEX ED ahahahahahah
aLGe7JZEaa	Homework is work assigned by a teacher, school or other educational institution, to be completed by the student at home or while not attending class. The term is generally used to refer to primary or secondary school assignments as opposed to college-level coursework.<br>  <br>  Many students find homework to be an undue burden, while schools and teachers generally insist that it is necessary to practice new skills and to better learn material.<br>  <br>  Rather than doing their own work, some students plagiarize or shirk their requirements (for example, by using Cliffs Notes instead of reading a book). If they are caught, punishments can range from a warning to expulsion from the institution, depending upon the school's policies and the severity of the infraction. See school discipline.<br>  <br>  In recent years, there has been some backlash about the amount of homework assigned. Some statistics show that homework has nearly doubled for children since their grandparents' time. In some cases, several hours of work may be assigned every day, leading to incomplete or mediocre work and overstressed students. The worst cases may actually cause children to develop mental problems. In response to such concerns, some schools have instituted policies lessening the homework load and requiring teachers to coordinate when assigning large, long-term projects.<br>  <br>  Like most educational-related work, homework can become a bigger burden as circumstances change. One of the worst and most dramatic increases of student workload was during the Cold War. For a period of time, the United States government was pushing large amounts of science and mathematics on children in hopes of having greater technological skills at America's command.<br>  <br>  Students who fail to do their homework employ a various range of excuses, the most clichéd being "The dog ate it". In cartoons, main characters actually have their homework eaten on various occasion, but the teacher fails to believe them, leading on a wild goose chase to actually prove it.<br>  <br>  Some public and private schools use a homework hotline which states the homework for the day. It can either be a telephone number that can be called up, or it may be a website that a student can go to.|`|3ZH3BUSYaa	Plato guy in Greece.<br>  <br>  Teachers.<br>  <br>  Parents.|`|9e2OSbEuaa	probably teachers|`|2GMdTj3aaa	Cunts|`|nOowkd3aaa	Adults who were bored and wanted something to do. they liked solving stupid problems that you will never actually use in life so they decided to make their kids do it too. now kids everywhere get to do it everyday after school.|`|MXTTocsmaa	About invented homework can be read in <a href="http://usa-people-blog.blogspot.com/?q=invented%20homework" rel="nofollow">http://usa-people-blog.blogspot.com/?q=i...</a>|`|Gh5FVkS6aa	some moronic kid hater, of course!|`|xr7EDlWZaa	Mothers who felt their children had too much free time.|`|z3jRrrvnaa	ahh, good question my friend|`|3nGhryADaa	STUPID PEOPLE DID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:(|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	students who didn't do well in class|`|mPGvKoZuaa	Teachers who dont want to put in the extra effort to teach better.

0S75fsMiaa	I charge $35 an hour to tutor, but I have a degree and teach middle school. You should pick up the phone and call a few tutoring companies. You can use Yahoo to find tutoring companies in your area by searching reading tutoring and your city and state.<br>  <br>  Find out what they are charging and price yourself below that. Be sure to consider the time that it will take you to get to and from a student's house.<br>  <br>  Be sure to meet the people you are going to tutor in a public place and arrange for a parent to call you if you tutor in a private home. Make sure you tutor in a public part of the house or at least that the door to the room that you are tutoring in stays open.<br>  <br>  At your age, I would shy away from tutoring in the homes of people who hire you, unless you know the person very well and an adult will be home. It's sad, but you should be cautious and protect yourselves. Carry a cell phone with you to any meeting, even the ones in public.<br>  <br>  As far as pricing, once you know what it would cost a parent to get a tutor from a professional company, you are in a much better position to negotiate prices. You can't get the same price because you're not as qualified, but you will at least know what prices are in your area.<br>  <br>  Set a minimum in your mind. I would say $15. Then ask for $20 an hour. Depending on the neighborhood and income of the family whose child you are tutoring, you might get your asking price. If you have to negotiate, you already know your bottom price and should just walk away from anyone who won't pay you at least $15. You also have a little room to negotiate, so you should still end up making more than the minimum.<br>  <br>  You can get creative with your pricing. You could start at $20/hr and offer $15 an hour for three one hour lessons paid in advance. You're an A student, so don't sell too cheap!<br>  <br>  Keep the names and phone numbers of parents you have worked with. Once you have achieved some successes, ask to use them for references, which will also show that you are professional and reduce the chances people will haggle with you over price.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your friend.

AA10023710	To get into a good film school, like UCLA, USC or NYU, you need to be doing film and art now, because you  need to have a portfolio for your college applications. If you aren't doing film now, start. There are summer film classes available at art schools, at community colleges, and even at NYU itself, and those will help you start in the right direction. <br>  <br>  An example is NYU's film major portfolio requirements:<br>  <a href="http://undergraduate.tisch.nyu.edu/object/ugfilmportfolio.html" rel="nofollow">http://undergraduate.tisch.nyu.edu/objec...</a><br>  <br>  Or if your real love is actually scriptwriting, you need a writing portfolio instead of an artistic portfolio:<br>  <a href="http://undergraduate.tisch.nyu.edu/object/ugddwportfolio.html" rel="nofollow">http://undergraduate.tisch.nyu.edu/objec...</a><br>  <br>  Many people who major in film or scriptwriting get their first job as a production assistant, or PA trainee, in film or tv. Let me give you one example of a trainee program that can lead to such a job: <br>  <a href="http://www.joinourteam.espn.com/joinourteam/college-pa_trainee.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joinourteam.espn.com/joinourt...</a><br>  <br>  Trainee jobs don't pay well, but they give you the experience you need in order to move forward in your career. <br>  <br>  If you want to work in film, you very likely will have low paying jobs at first, either as you work some McJob in order to support your own filmmaking, or else as you work as a PA in order to get a foot in the door of the industry. But your plan is to work your way up from that. <br>  <br>  For example, one friend of mine started out as a PA on a science fiction tv series. He went on, in the end, to write for it and be co-executive producer. He now works on the tv series 24 as writer and co-executive producer. <br>  <br>  You do have to prove yourself, and you'll need good networking, but it can work.|`|jinAwMGNaa	Check with your local TV News and see about the qualifications to be a Newscaster.

They will take the shots like they did at your school. If possible, book with the studio that is taking your school's photos. Also, you don't have to wait until after you leave, you can book before you go to get the proofs earlier. Good luck, and I hope this helped a bit!

ncqfq0b3aa	If I were you, I would stay away from Full Sail University. It is a for-profit school, meaning they are in it for the money, not the education. If I was the head of a entertainment studio, and had to choose between someone who graduated from USC Film School or someone who graduated from Full Sail University, I would choose the USC graduate. That is because USC is more reputable than Full Sail, and I can trust the USC graduate to do a more thorough job.<br>  <br>  Now, there are a few that have come from Full Sail and made good, but that is only a small percentage. However, most graduates of Full Sail (like most that graduates from for-profit schools) will either be turned down by employers or will be hired as cheap labor.<br>  <br>  The scheduling is crazy. They claim they are a 24/7 school, which could lead a student to burnout. I even called at midnight and someone answered the phone. I will admit their website is real eye popping candy. But a good looking website does not make a good school.<br>  <br>  On top of that, it is not regionally accredited by a governing body of the US Department of Education, so that makes it questionable. It's national accreditation is not recognized by regionally accredited schools. So if you want to transfer you are out of luck.<br>  <br>  However, you do not have to take my word that Full Sail is a ripoff. Go to the website below and listen to someone that actually went there. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is find a traditional college with a good film/communications department. You will be better off in the long run.

The same goes with 9 for 3 (divisible by 9 means divisible by 3).<br>  <br>  If a number is divisible by 8 and 9, then it's divisible by 6 (since 6 = 2 * 3)<br>  <br>  So, you need a number divisible by 5, 8, and 9. The smallest should be 360.<br>  <br>  Edit: 180 isn't divisible by 8

I'm sure he knows its wrong that's why he said keep it a secret, you should really tell because he can take advantage of you and you might not know it at first but he can and probably will. it might seem like a little thing now but it is a very big situation and could get really serious and out of hand, so before it does you should tell someone right away. and don't care about anyone if they try to talk about you for telling because you can probably stop something bad from happening before it does.

If someone's talking about someone behind their back, tell them to stop and you don't really give a shiit.  <br>  Be careful who you tell things too. Do you really trust them? Are they loyal? Can they keep a secret? Probably not. No one can. Not unless their heart is made of gold.<br>  I knwo what you mean about getting in trouble, and that's never fun.

I'd rather you pick 2-4 that you have a true interest in, and try to do something focused and important for one of them. <br>  <br>  Rather than adding a bunch of new things, instead think about things that maybe you can do that add on to something you're already doing; or that you can do while you're already at an activity you go to regularly anyway. Or heck, why not just do more in what you're already doing? You're president of the gaming club. Do more with that. Do a fundraiser connected to gaming, and for a local charity. Run a big gaming event, and have all the entry fees go to charity, and offer some bizarre prize. You're in NHS - do something else for them. Don't even bother adding lots of new stuff at this late date.

Is there a specific reason you want to attend one of these particular universities? Do you have any other options in mind?  It sounds like you are driving yourself very hard to be accepted to one or the other, but you know it is not so much where you start to attend, but from where you end up getting your degree.  If you are not accepted to either of these institutions initially, you can always go somewhere else in the mean time.  There are tons of colleges and universities which would snap you up in a heartbeat with your record, and probably award scholarships.  There is nothing wrong with being accepted somewhere else to start and get yourself acquainted with college life.  I hate to say it, but high school does not prepare you for college.
HOvJHYTtaa	Hi, i am an ex school board member and i agree with searches but only with probable cause.IE if a child is acting strangely and has red eyes etc. However i think the child`s parents should be notified in the first instance and questioned over the phone or in person.<br>  By involving the parent you would get a good indication of weather you were barking up the wrong tree or not.<br>  A call to the police would be a good idea to get information on your rights as a searcher and also the rights of the child and parents.<br>  MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH before approaching any child or you could end up in court.<br>  Good luck

The top number of your fraction is called the numerator. The bottom number is called your denominator. I like to call it the "doggy denominator" because in my house, the dog always sleeps outside. So when you draw your little division house,.. put the denominator outside and your numerator inside and divide. You might have to put in a decimal place with some. Just always remember, doggy denominator goes outside the house.

lAZWTLtRaa	That wouldn't happen. <br>  There's only so many jobs available in other fields, so people who couldn't get a job would resort to becoming a teacher.<br>  But then again, there are hundreds of different kinds of teachers.<br>  How about people who love music?? What job could you get in music besides working for a recording artist or for a record company??<br>  How about English? What if you didn't want to write a book? <br>  People become teachers so they can give back to the community and share their knowledge.<br>  I'll tell you right now, I'm not a school teacher but if no one was a teacher I wouldn't have a job right now.<br>  So in the end, people would be forced to work as teachers just to make ends meet.<br>  And some people find it a rewarding job: they do it for the experience, not just out of interest.<br>  Lets pretend that there are enough jobs in other fields and there are no teachers.<br>  Parents would have to home school their children. College/university wouldn't exist, because there are no teachers. Knowledge requirements/degrees/diplomas/etc would not be required to get a job since no one would have them.<br>  You'd have tons of people who don't know what they're doing working and making mistakes. The world would be in utter chaos and the human race would become extinct. (It would take a while, because the generations WITH knowledge would die out. You can't teach everything you learned in your lifetime to your kids, so they wouldn;t be able to teach all of that to their kids, and we'd just keep getting dumber and dumber).|`|3EIZ9vkeaa	the government would higher teachers wage to encourage people to become teachers.

While his comrades cheer him on to victory, encouraging him into acts of bravery, the "hero" gets a sudden insight into the meaninglessness of war.

hyHvG1Olaa	Any school that follows the effective school correlates found at <a href="http://ces.ou.edu/sevencorrelates.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ces.ou.edu/sevencorrelates.htm</a> has minimized the chance of “interruptions and disruptions” on the campus.  However, not all school follow the correlates so this means other means need to be arrived at to provide for the safety of personnel and students.  This being said when there is a strong instructional focus on the part of the professional staff combined with the effective use of instructional time in the classroom and the rules of conduct are well understood the disciplinary problems involving interruptions and disruptions are minimized.<br>  <br>  A note here, any object propelled with sufficient force or used incorrectly can be effective as a weapon.  The object of the professionals on the campus is to minimize the student’s access to such items whenever possible.<br>  <br>  Any educational professional should also be aware of the concept of “with-it-ness” or namely being aware at all times of the climate, the placement of students,  the level of understanding on the part of the learner(s), etc.  When with-it-ness is used effectively and used as a gauge to monitor the class’s participation or an individual’s participation the students are aware the professional in the classroom understands the “effective use of instructional time in the classroom and the rules of conduct” and is able to effectively incorporate  them into the learning process.<br>  <br>  I went on a little but I have worked with violent students for over 15 years in Alternative Educational settings involving JJAPE, Alt. Ed., and Special Needs clients.  The answer is not easy the rule is “never turn your back” and “always be aware of your surroundings”.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	First of all, weapons are no joke.  Your safety and other students' safety is the most important thing.  If a student threatens or attempts or anything I would demand suspension from the principal.  Schools generally are pretty strict in this area.<br>  <br>  A lot of times students act this way for attention.  I think the easiest thing to do is to remove that attention.  Have them do their work in another room.  Of course, first of all warn them if the behavior continues they will lose the right to be in the classroom.  After some time allow them to return, but if they go back to the negative behavior remove them again.|`|INCFl5gTaa	I know that you what answers from teachers<br>  I'll let you know I'm not a teacher-- but a student.<br>  What seems to minimize interruptions in class in my school is giving out work for interruptions. <br>  "Interrupt the class again, and you're getting a 500 word essay for homework that's going to be graded for as test"<br>  or if It's bad enough, Send them down to the Dean/principal/Office.<br>  <br>  But for secondary age students-- they need to learn what's right and what is wrong. You need to tell them, if they interrupt the class, you won't be able to do this or that. Tell them you will tell their mom or dad that they've been bad in class. <br>  <br>  If you know they have access to dangerous items as such, it should immediately be brought up to the principal so he can take appropriate action towards it.|`|ZgprgA1Naa	I have found that if your students have a level of respect for you and you go to them quietly to correct their behavior, it works better.  Some students get angry and believe they have to compete for the last word and that creates more disruptions.  If they have weapons, definitely they need to be referred to the administrator.  Try teacher exchanging and sometimes parent contact works. Good Luck|`|LHRvhtIRaa	If you teaching at that level your personality need to be strong, by strong I don't mean wrestler but emotionally strong, the kind of students you are talking they come to school for fun. You need to be assertive but do not indulge in any verbal war or threats. don't be friendly with them, tell them you will report to parents and principal if they don't work properly, some students will never study even if you beg them to, hundreds of factors are behind what there mindset is made up of, you are not responsible for that mindset. take care and happy teachings

If you feel bad about it, trust your gut and speak with him. You may just need to know from him that he accepts your apology and that might make you fell better about the whole thing.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Talk to your teacher about what happened.  He's probably not taking it personally but more concerned about how you're doing in his class.  He likely sees a potential in you that you're not aware of, and that's why he "picks" on you--so you can see for yourself how great you are!|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	Don't let him think you are a student who doesn't care. Yes you should apologize and discuss it with him.|`|Lr0s0gvuaa	It is true that most teachers are used to rude behavior.  He will probably forget about the incident in a week or so.  But he will remain to have a wary attitude when it concerns you for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER.  Something he would remember is the fact that you made the extra effort to apologize.  If you even wrote him a little note or met him afterschool briefly to really express your guilt ("Oh, I know I apologized for this already, but I felt so awful I just wanted you to know that I really am sorry about being rude that other day."), he would remember the fact that you took the extra step to apologize.<br>  <br>  I understand that you felt like you were being picked on, but this is a GREAT opportunity to start patching up the relationship.  He might realize that you are also capable of being respectful and kind and start treating you better.|`|xxd03wBOaa	I would forget about it if i were a teacher but still i'd be a little hurt if you were a well behaved student. If i were you, i'd got see them tomorrow, say sorry again with a lot of feeling and explain why you did what you did and say it was out of character. Also say that you are not trying to make any excuses for your actions and tell them again that you are sincerely apologising. If you're nervous about, write them a letter of apology and give it to them personally.|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	I still get upset if students are rude to me, especially ones who are usually well-behaved.  I might be the teacher, but I am still human.  If you feel embarrassed about talking to him about the incident again (sometimes it can be a bit awkward and maybe he isn't as sensitive as me and has already forgotten about it!), why not ask to see him about something else e.g. a question about one of your English texts?  Then he will see that you are still a nice and serious person and maybe you were having an off-day yesterday!  And you will feel better knowing you've "repaired" your relationship a bit!|`|INCFl5gTaa	Well for one-- Tell him your sorry the next day, and since you're bringing it up again, he'll know you're serious about it. Also say that you weren't feeling that well yesterday, and was a little on edge. He should understand.<br>  I know how you feel-- I'm geeky too, lol. And us geeky people always hate it when we do something like this b/c we're not used to it, lol.<br>  Good luck talking to him =\.<br>  Just say. I'm sorry.|`|7yI55yrnaa	Don't worry about it, he has probably already forgotten about it.  He probably also 'picks' on you either because:<br>  <br>  a. He knows you will know the answer<br>  b.

Teachers are used to it.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	I read & answered your other question.<br>  Tell him you don't want to share your writing with the class, and tell him to stop asking you so often, but you will answer when you feel comfortable. Tell him that you'll raise your hand to read your work aloud when you feel like it, and to give other students a chance to answer.<br>  <br>  @ forgetting:<br>  all teachers are different. they have too much on their plates to stay mad/upset with a student for a long time, and they probably don't want to be mad at them (unless they're really reallly bad) so chances are he'll forgive and forget. I remember last year, the guy who sat next to me started copying my homework cuz I had it out on my desk ready to hand it in. My teacher had a strong policy of no homework copying or an instant 0. Well. Wasn't my fault he decided to copy, but my teacher was still really mad. For the rest of the day I couldn't even look at her, and I could feel my eyes watering cuz I'm not one to get zeros. Dreading the next day, I trudged into class, and it was like the day before hadn't even happened, which shocked me. And now she's my favourite teacher. So go figure.<br>  Anyways long story short, you should be honoured that he likes your work so much he only asks YOU (well you and the other guy but w/e who cares about him right now xD) to read out your work, to set the bar high for your class and to show them what they need to aim for.|`|AA11510511	Just go up to him at your next lesson, and apologise to him, and explain that this incident was out of character for you.

If your in a smaller setting i am quite sure its obvious depending on your body language and your interactions (especially eye contact).|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes.  College students are not subtle.  Maybe they think they are, but they aren't.  It's quite obvious when they're interested, or at least want you to think they are for some reason or another.  But really, most of your professors are not attracted to you - I've taught many, many college students over the years, and although many of them were physically attractive, they were simply too young, to inexperienced, and frankly too dim-witted to even consider a non-school-related conversation with them.|`|fl0dj2AYaa	well i think it goes the same for any male individual. and it also depends on how much the female shows her wants for that professor, you get it? like if the girl just wants him but isn't flirtatious or shows signs then he probably wouldn't know, but if she is always flirting, talking to him, smiling at him, and all that he probably gets the idea.<br>  <br>  the only other thing he could think is that they are sucking up for a good grade.

If you have received an "overpayment" of financial aid, your school will require that you return any excess funds.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you get that resolved quickly, because your aid office can not qualify you for any further funds until your overpayment has been taken care of.<br>  <br>  Financial aid eligibility is based on your anticipated Cost of Attendance. If that Cost of Attendance was estimated based on the assumption that you would take 12 or more hours in each of 2 semesters - but you only took a total of 15 - then obviously your tuition expenses were far lower than the school estimated they would be. Chances are that you have received too much aid.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if your school correctly based your aid analysis on an accurate understanding of how many credits you intended to register for (6 and 9), then they've already taken your modified tuition cost into account.<br>  <br>  Be careful with your credit hours - some forms of aid are not available to students who take fewer than some minimum number. If you receive a Pell Grant, you are not entitled to the full award unless you are a full time (12+ hours) student. The Pell award is adjusted downward for part time students, depending on how many hours you actually registered for.<br>  <br>  So, yes. Though it's unclear what exact forms of aid you are receiving, the chances are pretty good that you may have received an overpayment - especially if your school calculated your aid eligibility based on an understanding that you would be a full-time student in both semesters.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend an appointment with the aid office, so that they can review your aid package. Better to find out about it now, and make a payment arrangement (if necessary), rather than find your aid blocked in a future semester. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12291184	i think as long as you are in like two classes you don't have to start paying it back.

UDEMDcGuaa	Bob has mostly been a musician, touring and recording and writing his songs.  He took part in a few civil rights events in the south in the early 60's and was there (onstage I thnk) when ML King Jr made his I have a dream speech in Washington, he wrote the song Hurricane as part of an attempt to get Rueben "hurricane" Carter released from jail,he took part in the "we are the world" recording in the 80's.  Bob consciously withdrew from political action by the mid-60's ( with the occasional exception).  Bob's legacy is his music and the effects it has had on millions and their views of the world.

He called on me more because he knew I was paying attention, which was kinda annoying, but I also got an A in the class.

But there are a couple of word choices that muddy your meaning.<br>  <br>  The second clause, "Bush's continuance on [the] 'War on Terror'" doesn't make sense.

Or do you mean "Bush's emphasis on," that his persistence on pushing the issue led to more intolerance?<br>  <br>  "Mistakes caused by other races" is also somewhat clunky. I think you mean "mistakes attributed to other races," which is more value-neutral, and also says that the people of those races are blamed for actually making the mistakes, not that they somehow caused someone else to make them.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense.

ijKlL4Coaa	Chess is a game where it's logical "face" is patterns or configurations.  And it's the recognition of these patterns that separate the strong players from the weak players.  <br>  Sorta like those 3D pictures that you have to look at funny in order to see the image.  That's why a large amount of masters and GM's say that if your under master level "your first name should be tactics, your middle name should be tactics, and your last name should be tactics."<br>  That's why in the world of studying chess you'll have swaths of puzzle books and all they're really doing is getting you to drill a RECOGNITION of what the piece formation is.  And why all other study material presents game after game representing that specific theme you wish to study.<br>  What usually precedes a cognitive leap?  It can be anything cause everyone is different, however, think of the "cognitive leap" as a seed being germinated and sprouting (studying, studying, studying) and then one day you'll just see all these moves (flowering) cause the move you drill positions and puzzles into your head the more natural your "chess vision" becomes and you're able to see the WHOLE position and what each piece does, is doing, where it's placed and how it affects the position.  That is a fundamental difference as to what separates the weak players from the small players, being able to see the "big picture".

AA10176626	Moe:<br>  <br>  As part of the FAFSA processing system, the Department of Education automatically compares your name and vital information (date and place of birth) with the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. If the information on your FAFSA does not completely match the information on record at SSA and DHS, the form is kicked back for an "incomplete match". <br>  <br>  The result is exactly what you have seen - a request for you to document the information that you provided on your FAFSA form.<br>  <br>  Take a good look at the Student Aid Report that you received from the Department of Education, and make certain that you entered your Social Security Number correctly. Also make absolutely certain that you completed the FAFSA using the full legal name that you're recorded under for all government purposes - most likely your birthname.<br>  <br>  This tends to happen when applicants who call themselves "Mike" complete the FAFSA as Mike McDonald, when their full legal name (and their social security records) is Michael McDonald. It also tends to happen when applicants use middle names or nicknames. Even if EVERYONE calls you "Mitch McDonald", so as not to confuse you with your dad Michael, you're still Michael McDonald to the federal government, and a FAFSA completed for Mitch is going to mess things up.<br>  <br>  If you have a social security number, bring your social security card to the financial aid office at your school, along with the SAR that you received from the Department of Education. At this point, it's the responsibility of the financial aid office to collect documentation of your eligibility for aid, and review any materials that you can provide in support of your FAFSA responses.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

cMZEmpp0aa	Wow, I really hope ESL up there isn't suggesting what I think is being suggested.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I have a hard time using "Memoirs of a Geisha" as a source for much of anything. If the book has been assigned for you to use, I suppose there's no getting around it. Unfortunately because the main female characters in the book are geisha, and because the lives of geisha and the lives of other Japanese women are very different, it's going to be tough for you to use this book to make any broad conclusions about the treatment of women in Japan based on how the geisha are treated. Plus, the book takes place at a very specific time period, so it would be a mistake to use that information to generalize about other time periods in Japan as well. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you pick one character and focus on how that character is treated. Sayuri is the obvious example since her life is the focus, so it's pretty obvious how she gets treated by different people. But if you have the time and you're allowed to use other resources, I really would suggest that you take the time to do a bit of extra research so you can point out how the treatment Sayuri receives compares with, say, the treatment of non-geisha women at that time, or the treatment of modern geisha, or whatever else seems interesting to you. Remember that even though there is some truth to the book, "Memoirs" is fiction and is drowning in wrong/misleading information.

R20LOzsiaa	I just started learning speed reading a few months ago. There are actually different reading techniques that can help reading fast without sacrifying the understanding of reading material (another word for this is comprehension).<br>  <br>  The formal way to learn to read fast is by learning speed reading techniques. An example of speed reading techniques is by eliminating subvocalization, as most of us read with a little voice in our brain but the voice is actually holding us from reading faster (our brain can process information much faster than our speaking speed). Another example of speed reading techniques is to read two or more words at one time instead of one word each time. There are some other skills like technique to ease the understanding of a segment of text, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are serious to learn to read faster, you may go for some speed reading course. The speed reading course I used has quite a lot of good feedback from Amazon. There is also a website reviewing it, which recommends how to make the best out of the program. I choose the online version with the combo bonus too. I've include both links for your reference.|`|HOvJHYTtaa	Reading fast and absorbing the information are two different things.<br>  Reading something that you are really interested in will get you reading faster without you even realising it

leCSVYgAaa	Oooh... nothing like a nice juicy equations of motion problem!<br>  <br>  When working out problems such as these, we need to have regard to the following quantities:-<br>  <br>  t = time<br>  s = distance<br>  u = initial velocity<br>  v = final velocity<br>  a = acceleration<br>  <br>  The letters are those conventionally used, but you could of course use any convenient label.<br>  <br>  There are various equations of motion which link these quantities.  I won't go on to how these equations are derived, but basically they are:-<br>  <br>  v = u + at<br>  <br>  v^2 = u^2 - 2as<br>  <br>  s = ut + (1/2)at^2<br>  <br>  s = vt - (1/2)at^2<br>  <br>  s = (1/2)(u + v) t<br>  <br>  Each equation relies on 4 of the variables, and omits the 5th. Therefore we need to identify which 4 variables are relevant to our set of facts.  <br>  <br>  In our example, which are relevant?<br>  <br>  We are asked to find t (at least, t is relevant to the overall time calculation).<br>  We know s, the distance, which is the depth of the shaft.<br>  We also know a, acceleration, in this case acceleration due to gravity.<br>  <br>  But that's only three variables, right?  Look carefully, we also know something else.  We know the initial velocity, u, because the stone is dropped into the mine shaft, so if someone holds out the stone and releases it, the initial velocity was zero.<br>  <br>  So the relevant variables are t, s, a and u.<br>  <br>  The equation we want therefore is s = ut + (1/2)at^2.<br>  <br>  Putting in the values we have, we get:<br>  <br>  186.5 = 0(t) + (1/2)(9.8)t^2, or<br>  <br>  186.5 = 4.9t^2, so<br>  <br>  t^2 = 38.06, and<br>  <br>  t = 6.17.<br>  <br>  So it takes 6.17 seconds for the stone to hit the bottom of the shaft.<br>  <br>  But we also need to know how long it takes the sound of the impact to arrive back to Carol.<br>  <br>  This is more straightforward, and we can use the time = distance/speed (which is actually a simplified version of s = (1/2)(u + v)t, but anyway).<br>  <br>  The time taken for the sound to reach Carol is 186.5/343, or 0.54 seconds.<br>  <br>  The total time interval between dropping the stone and hearing the impact is therefore 6.17 + 0.54 seconds, or 6.71 seconds.

At Stanford University she earned bachelor's degrees in both chemical engineering and African-American studies; later as a young M.D. she administered health programs in West Africa for the Peace Corps. She entered NASA's astronaut program in June 1987, and as a science-mission specialist on Endeavour in September 1992 she conducted experiments on uses of biofeedback in countering motion sickness, effects of space on human calcium levels, and effects of weightlessness on the development of other organisms.

Money can have intrinsic value, in the case of precious metal coin that is often worth far more than the face value stamped into the coin. Paper money's value is extrinsic only.  A $20 dollar bill is only worth $20 because people are willing to exchange items of real value, goods or services, for a piece of paper that has no real value, and that is because a system of trust has been established.  That is extrinsic value, value that comes from outside of the thing, in this case, an idea.<br>  <br>  Another example of extrinsic value is sentimental value.  An item that would be of little value to most anyone else has great value to the person with a sentimental attachment.  Very often, when clearing out estates left by deceased individuals with no family, photographs that were treasured by the deceased are considered trash and discarded.

jd14u32qaa	Satire is the use of sarcasm or irony to make fun of or mock an absurdity.  Did you see 'Tropic Thunder'?  Ben Stiller plays an actor in the film and on of his roles was playing a mentally retarded character.  A lot of people said he was making fun of the handicapped, but he wasn't.  He was making fun of the real life actors who PLAY handicapped roles and win awards for them.  The satire there is that Stiller was using this role to mock the real life actors who have played mentally handicapped characters because those roles are 'more challenging' or they 'really test your skills'  as an actor.

Here goes -<br>  <br>  Just do a rough drawing of a square and draw a diagonal so that has about a 5 cm diagonal from corner to corner.<br>  <br>  You should now be looking at two similar right-angled triangles with the same 5 cm hypoteneuse and you just need to find the length of one of the other sides and multiply it by 4 to find the perimeter of the square.<br>  <br>  It helps if you know the Pythagoras formula that says that the square on the hypoteneuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.<br>  (If you do not understand this bit, find someone to explain it to you because you need to know it before you go on). <br>  <br>  The square on the 5 cm hypoteneuse is 25 square centimetres so the square on each of the other two equal sides is 12.5 square centimetres.<br>  So each side is equal to the square root of 12.5 which is 3.5355 so the four sides add up to a perimeter of 14.412 centimetres.<br>  <br>  Answer 14.412 centimetres.|`|pUWUf5Xfaa	If it's the diagonal, then you have a special right triangle with angle measures that equal 45, 45, and 90.<br>  In a 45, 45, 90 right triangle, the side lengths compared to the hypotenuse is 1,1, and the square root of 2.<br>  To find the length of one side, you divide 5 by the square root of 2.<br>  You cannot have a radical in the denominator, so you have to multiply by the square root of 2 divided by the square root of 2.<br>  That gives you side lengths of 5 to the square root of 2 divided by 2.<br>  Multiply that by 4 and the perimeter is around 14 cm.|`|qZNvfdtfaa	Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you can find that the ratio between the legs of a triangle and its hypotenuse to be 1:1:root2.<br>  Thus if your diagonal, which is the hypotenuse of a triangle if you cut your square in half, is 5cm, then it must be proportional to the root2 side.

leCSVYgAaa	I'm sorry lildude but this has nothing to do with refraction.<br>  <br>  The reason the sky appears blue is that blue light has a shorter wavelength than red or yellow light.  <br>  <br>  As the light of the sun passes through the atmosphere, it is absorbed by gas molecules in the air.  However, the light with the longer wavelength (reds and yellows) is absorbed less, and most of it passes straight through.<br>  <br>  The blue light however is absorbed more.  Once absorbed, it is then radiated out, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering.  <br>  <br>  But the gas molecules aren't all aligned in one direction and move totally randomly, so blue light is being scattered all around and in all different directions, which is why we see blue all over the sky.<br>  <br>  Perhaps I should make the point, with reference to one of the other answers, that in fact the sea looks blue because it is largely reflecting the sky.<br>  <br>  P.S.  "ultraviolet" has no "colour".  Colour is something we attribute to the different wavelengths of *visible* light.  Ultraviolet light cannot be detected by the human eye and is therefore invisible to us.  The sun does of course give off ultraviolet light - it emits radiation of many many frequencies, including UV and towards the other end of the spectrum, of course Infra-Red, which is perceived by us as heat, but at the same time it is emitting a mix of visible light frequencies too, which is why we can see it!|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Reflection of water, since the earth has so musch water covering its surface.|`|mWwOFrFYaa	air and water Lol|`|X57KQV2daa	It has to do with the refraction of light in the ozone, technically the color is an ultraviolet color but since we can't truly see ultraviolet it appears to be blue.|`|55orqX2yaa	It is so, because all of the water on the surface of the Earth (about 75 to 80% of the Earth is),  ir reflected off the atmosphere, making it appear blue|`|qZNvfdtfaa	Air, water in it and refraction.<br>  <br>  If you really need to know ASAP, I'd suggest google or even wikipedia rather than waiting for someone to hand you the answer.

HlgcJ3FLaa	There is really no way of guessing what college you will get into at this point. You only have a semester of grades, you haven't taken the PSAT or SAT yet, and you haven't tried any sports yet.<br>  <br>  If you want to get an idea of where you are, you can go to the College Board website and take the practice SAT test they have there. Then look at their college search, they tell you the average score you need to get in.<br>  <br>  Here is the practice SAT test:<br>  <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/prep_one/test.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegeboard.com/student/test...</a><br>  <br>  Here's the college search page for Duke: <a href="http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=535&profileId=6" rel="nofollow">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/se...</a><br>  <br>  And Vanderbilt:<br>  <a href="http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=4045&profileId=6" rel="nofollow">http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/se...</a><br>  <br>  And just keep getting good grades and get involved in sports and volunteering and your interests (like maybe art or a musical instrument or something). It's good that you're taking an AP course next year already. You should also take the PSAT next year (most people are required to, but it doesn't count until junior year). That will prepare you for the SAT and give you an idea of what your score will be.<br>  <br>  But don't worry too much! It sounds like you are a really good student, so don't worry so much about college, just focus on high school and explore your interests fully so that you'll know what you want to do when you get there.<br>  <br>  I don't know about medicine vs. psychology -- I think it should all depend on whether you're better at biology or psychology. If your school has a psych class take it to see if you'll like it.|`|5YAe0Vffaa	It seems to me that if you take all those AP classes and play volleyball you'll be off to a great start to your high school career.  Just keep up your grades in those difficult classes and you'll be golden.  Oh, and score high on the ACT. You still have plenty of time to make up your resume.  <br>  As for the job, just do what you want.  You may change your mind once you start taking classes for them in college and that's ok.  I don't think we should have to know for sure what we want to do for the rest of our lives in high school.

(I think if you just want to own one you do not have to be qualified but your staff do need to be qualified) depending on what country you live. I am not sure about the US but in Australia and the UK it is similar. I did my training in the UK and I did Nursery Nursing which I believe now is NVQ I think you need at least level 3 if not 4. It is changing all the time and I am rather out of the loop in the UK. Check out your local college and they will be able to tell you ,what level you need.<br>  The second part of your question staff ratios again this is different depending on where you live<br>  Here in Australia it is 5-1 for babies up to 2 in some places it is is 4-1 and with 2-3 it is 8 to 1 and kindergarten (3-5) is 10 -1. You need to have at least 1 qualified member of staff for each room. I suggest although it may not be necessary have at least 3 staff who have a certificate which is just below the diploma. I also suggest that in the baby room you have at least two members  of staff who are a qualified.

AA10176626	Okay, listen, first of all, ignore that other answer about whether your parents claim you as dependents. If there's one thing I'm determined to some day accomplish around here is to disabuse the very last person of the idea that income tax dependency and financial aid dependency are related.  I've answered more than 2500 questions, and I've commented on that particular issue more than any of the others combined. <br>  <br>  When you are determining your financial aid dependency it is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT whether ANYONE claims you or does not claim you as a dependent on their tax returns.<br>  <br>  Now that I have that out of the way - let's look at your question.<br>  <br>  If you were born before January 1, 1985, you are an independent, no matter where you live, or who supports you. <br>  <br>  You have a child - now let's get to the important question - do you provide more than 50% of the financial support for that child? More importantly, will you be providing more than 50% of that support NEXT YEAR?<br>  <br>  If you're living with your mom or dad because you can't afford your own expenses - they're helping you out with a place to live, and food, and all of that other good stuff - then you're not providing more than 50% of the support for your child. That's unlikely to change while you're attending school.<br>  <br>  If the child's other parent is providing you with monthly child support that is used to pay more than 50% of the financial support for the child, then you're not providing that support.<br>  <br>  The only way you are providing more than 50% of your child's support is if you worked this year, and you made enough to continue paying most of the expenses all throughout next year. And when I say bills, I don't just mean that you'll buy most of the clothes, because it's the shelter, and the food and the utilities and the medical bills that are the high ticket items in support.<br>  <br>  So the question comes down to - are you working and will you be paying most of your child's expenses? If so, you answer Question 53 as "yes". Otherwise, the answer is "no".<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

HlgcJ3FLaa	I'd take AP Chem, especially if you're going into medicine. If you get a good grade on the exam, unc ch lets you skip introductory chemistry so that you can go straight into organic chem as a freshman. Which would leave you more time to take advanced bio and chem courses later on. Or maybe you could even graduate in 3 years, seeing as you have SO many APs. (I can't believe you would take 5 APs in one year!! I would be so overwhelmed, but if you can do it then that's pretty cool.)<br>  <br>  My opinion (which is not really based on any specific facts) is that so far you will definitely get into Chapel Hill. It says their average SAT is 590-690 for critical reading, 620-700 for math, and 590-690 for writing on the college board website.

ySjI5qwKaa	Speak to your parents and ask them to speak to the principle or appropriate member of the administration.  I had a teacher that was so mean i wanted to drop out of school.  My parents went and talked to the principle. It turned out so many kids felt the same way that the teacher was asked to leave.  I am not saying your parents can or should get a teacher just for being mean, but if the administration sees that she is upsetting students and parents they will have a stern word with her.  Also if your parents talk directly to a member of the administration they can ask that you are not named.  If your parents for what ever reason won't go talk to the school, go talk to the guidance councilor about it he or she can maybe able to get you into another class.<br>  <br>  I am assuming you are somewhere between k-12.  If you're in college it's best just keep your head down or drop the class, and make sure you give appropriate feedback on the teacher evaluation form.|`|lMpsU7iUaa	I would try to give her a gift ( could be from the dollar tree), and see how she responds:<br>  - If she was nice about it, than you know she's just doing her job.<br>  -if she's mean about it, then I'm sorry to say, but you may have to put up with it.|`|AA11251285	Many adults & students consider kindness a sign of weakness. If a teacher is nice, some students  will not respect that teacher and they will misbehave.<br>  <br>  Your teacher is mean because being mean has worked for this teacher in the past.<br>  Some teachers feel they need to be mean to get the students to behave and follow directions.<br>  Your teacher spends a lot of time reminding students not to tap their pencils on the desk, throw spit-balls, hit people, talk while the teacher talks, kick the seat in front of them, make unnecessary noises, etc.<br>  <br>  People are afraid of angry/rude people and tend to comply with their wishes to avoid being on the receiving end of that hostility.<br>  <br>  Some children learn from their parents that you don't need to take your parents seriously until they get mad and start yelling. These children tend NOT to obey the teacher until the teacher yells or gets mad.<br>  <br>  My advice to the student: Don't take it personally. Your teacher is mean to everyone they come into contact with.  When you go to class, you need to follow directions and try not to give the teacher any reasons for sending anger your way. If you feel your teacher has crossed the line, you need to have your parents set up a meeting with this teacher to discuss it.|`|28pcgUw4aa	I'm a relatively new teacher (about six months) and while this may have nothing to do with your situation, I just want to corroborate what another person said: some teachers behave sternly to show authority.  I think I am a pretty stern teacher; I'm not abusive, but I'm stern.  I think it is just a natural behavior of mine because I was very wary (from the get-go) of being walked over or disrespected.  It's almost like I made a pre-emptive strike by just being stern right off the bat, like "don't even try it." I guess I have my reasons for this; I'm kind of short and I look young, and I was worried that that would be an even greater invitation (in the beginning) for kids not to take me seriously.  I was stern right away and still somewhat am.

DCFpYvxEaa	In ecology, predation describes a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey, the organism that is attacked.[1] Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation always results in the death of the prey.[2] The other main category of consumption is detritivory, the consumption of dead organic material (detritus). It can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviors[1], for example where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat what is available and have no direct impact on the "donor" organism(s).<br>  <br>   <br>  A hawk swooping down to catch a mouse.|`|XEQKAYFraa	In ecology, predation describes a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey, the organism that is attacked.[1] Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation always results in the death of the prey<br>  <br>  A lion stalking a zebra and then killing it and eating it|`|YQxxVdLNaa	Definition - the state of living as a predator or by predation<br>  <br>  Example - When an animal hunts<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|2YMn0JuYaa	When a prey is attacked by a predator.|`|qwvijKexaa	animals that hunt

Then we all follow the family to the cementary and we say some more prayers and then we bury that person. Then we go to family house and they have alot of food that neighbors, friends and family have brought over.

PTdy6TWRaa	The Great Trail Council's main contact phone number is 330-773-0415 <br>  <br>  The council is made up of 7 districts. The following link will show you the map and breakdown of the districts. Click the map on the area that represents where you live and you'll be taken to a page with contact info for that district as well as links to the district web pages where more info can be found. Someone in your district should then be able to answer your questions on local troops and merit badge counsellors. <a href="http://www.gtcbsa.org/district.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gtcbsa.org/district.html</a><br>  <br>  Visiting some troops may be the best way to get a sense of whether or not they'll be the right fit for your son. By far the most important factor will be whether or not it seems like a fun and welcoming group of kids and leaders. You might encounter a wide variety of program offerings from troop to troop however none of those offerings or approaches to the program really matter at all if the right spirit and personalities aren't there.  So, resist getting caught up in over-thinking the numerous options, questions and pros and cons of each group but try to focus mainly on finding a good group of people that your son can fit in with and feel comfortable with. That will be his #1 key to having fun and long-term success in Scouting. Good luck!|`|AA10614558	Hello mailaccount63: <br>  <br>  It is great that your son wants to join! You do not need to contact the District rep to join Boy Scouts. This is done at the unit (Troop) level. Visit all of the Scout troops in your area, and find out what the troop is like. Visit <a href="http://www.thescoutzone.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thescoutzone.org/</a> to learn more about the program, and go to the "Troop Locator" (SIC) link to find troops in your specific zip code. <br>  <br>  Large troops do more activities, however the adults tend to run things more. Smaller troops the boys will learn leadership skills and how to solve problems for themselves however it will look more chaotic and may be stressful for some people. Does the troop require a lot of equipment, are they more into uniform rules and regulations, or are they in the process of building men from boys? Does the family participate in the unit? Do the boys enjoy themselves? Are they enthusiastic about returning to the meetings each week? Do they look forward to at least one outing a month? Where did they go for Summer Camp last year? Where will they go this year? How many boys will be going? Is there a high-adventure program for the older boys? How many older boys stick with the troop? How much experience does the Scoutmaster have? Is he trained? Are the assistants trained? Does the troop have serviceable equipment? Talk not only with the Scoutmaster, but with another parent. Speak with some of the other Scouts. Are they open and welcoming to your son? Is HE excited to join that troop? <br>  <br>  I do need to mention that unless your son is 11, he is not eligible to join Boy Scouts until he has graduated 5th grade. Also, for the first year, your son will not work on merit badges; he will work on earning his First Class rank. It does seem that your District may have some logistical issues with getting the merit badge counselor list out to the units. This is not unusual; many Districts have difficulty sharing this information. However, the troop should have a list of parents, friends and civic citizens who are willing to help with merit badges. <br>  <br>  Keep on Scoutin'

Generally the medical is there to assess what kind of support they can offer you, only in exceptional circumstances will you be rejected, in my role above, in 5 years we only rejected one person because of poor health and that was medical.  If you are worried, please speak to the Uni, they will handle any questions with confidentiality, if you want to make sure you are speaking to the right people to help you, try going to student support rather than admissions.<br>  <br>  It is illegal to discriminate against disabilities, but it is not illegal if you are not suitable to do the position because of medical reasons.  You have to be of reasonable health to be undertaking a position in these careers.<br>  <br>  If you are really worried, speak to the uni student support or what was called 'disability' because of the discriminations act, they changed their names.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	It is now illegal to discriminate on grounds of disability, and that is what your mental health problems will be counted as.<br>  <br>  Basically they can only turn you down if you were not capable of doing the course so eg a blind person cannot learn to drive. A driving school can turn them down because you need to be able to see to drive.|`|UXgoY8Afaa	I don't think it would have any effect on you being accepted for the course - that will be done on merit i.e. how good your application is and how you come across in your interview.  They can't discriminate because you have been ill in the past, but if there are signs that you are >currently<  or very recently ill then obviously they will take that into consideration when deciding whether you are ready to be considered for their course.<br>  <br>  I think your mental health history will be more of an issue when you apply for a job after your degree.  Then I would think that there would have to have been a minimum 'clear' period before they would consider you.  I'm only guessing but I would think it would need to be at least 2 yrs.

QODJNf1oaa	You can go to college for a year and declare no major, and the put you in the liberal arts section. That way you can get your gen-eds (General Education) requirements out of the way so that in your later years of college, you can focus on what you want to do when you get out. Some suggestions if you have a hard time finding a major is find out exactly what you like to do, by working in different fields (do you like working with children, are you a born leader, are you more comfortable being at an office etc.) It took me forever to find a major, i switched back and forth between different areas that I felt that I could never see myself doing. Finally after along time, I took a psychology course and finally found something that I can do. If you choose psychology as your major, you can do almost anything with it. Business is in the same boat, once you choose that as your major you have so many options for when you graduate from school. Good luck, and remember don't feel pressured, you have plenty of time

ktOqm7cgaa	BACKGROUND: <br>  LIZ CLAIBORNE, founder of one of the world's most successful women's apparel manufacturing companies, was born Elisabeth Claiborne Ortenberg on March 31, 1929, in Brussels, Belgium, where her father, Omer V. Claiborne, was a banker for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. <br>  <br>  In the 1930s, Liz Claiborne lived with her father and mother in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she received a strict Roman Catholic upbringing. Her father did not consider formal education important, and before Claiborne graduated from high school he sent her to Europe to study art in Belgium and France. Although her parents expected her to become an artist, Claiborne wanted to study fashion and pursued a career as a clothing designer. <br>  <br>  When she was 21 years old her sketch for a woman's coat won a Jacques Heim design competition sponsored by Harper's Bazaar magazine. With this award and her sketching ability, Claiborne began working on Seventh Avenue in New York City's garment district as a design assistant and a model. <br>  <br>  From 1950 to 1955 she held several positions designing sportswear, tailored clothing, and high fashion. From 1955 to 1960 she was a dress designer for the Dan Keller company. From 1960 to December 1975 she was the principal designer for Youth Guild, the junior dress division of Jonathan Logan, a major women's apparel manufacturer. During this time Claiborne also raised her son from her first marriage to Ben Schultz and two step-children from her second marriage to Arthur Ortenberg, a textile manufacturer and consultant. <br>  <br>  Claiborne saw a need in the marketplace for more comfortable but professional apparel for working women. Claiborne's fashion sense told her women could use clothing that was easier to wear and softer than the tailored business suits, blouses, and bow ties then sold in department stores. Unable to convince her employer to enter the mix-and-match coordinated sportswear market for working women, Claiborne founded Liz Claiborne Inc. in 1976 along with her husband Art Ortenberg and Leonard Boxer. Their goal was to create a collection of outfits aimed at the growing number of women entering the work force.  Claiborne's collection of pants, skirts, shirts, sweaters, and jackets was instantly popular. <br>  <br>  Priced in a moderate range, from about $40 to $100, and sold in department stores, the Liz Claiborne label became known for its good quality materials, comfortable fit, good construction, color selection, and clean silhouettes. <br>  <br>  As sales increased from $2.6 million in 1976 to $117 million in 1981, the company was regarded as one of the best managed in the highly competitive and volatile women's fashion apparel business. The company continued to grow, and became a public company in 1981.<br>  <br>  In 1986, when company sales reached $1.2 billion, it joined the list of "Fortune" magazine's 500 largest industrial companies in the United States. It was one of only two companies started by a woman included on the list. Also in 1986, Claiborne, who was company president, became chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Until she retired in 1989, Claiborne remained the creative force behind the company's success and advised its design teams. She always emphasized fit, color, comfort, and good value as the company's goals. <br>  <br>  Claiborne and her husband retired from active management of the company in 1989 to pursue their environmental and philanthropic interests. The Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation was established in 1989 with assets of $10 million; it provides substantial support for wilderness preservation. They spent six months of each year at a ranch house in Swan Valley, Montana; they also had a home on Fire Island, New York, and one on the Caribbean Island of St. Barts. <br>  <br>  At the 2000 American Fashion Awards presented by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Claiborne, a philanthropist who funded millions of dollars of programs, was presented with a humanitarian award for her environmental work, particularly in helping to fight the ivory trade in Africa. Claiborne was also dedicated to helping women, particularly those in need of domestic violence services and business training.<br>  <br>  In 2007, Liz Claiborne lost a long battle with cancer.  She was 78 years old.<br>  [Taken from <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/biography/liz-claiborne/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/biography/liz-cl...</a>   and <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/news/liz-claiborne-dies-at-78-moc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/news/liz-claibor...</a> ] <br>  <br>  QUOTE:<br>  "Things should be easy.

trKgx3Ukaa	I know exactly what you mean about the power of professors in Germany and how they check every detail of your life history ( and that of your parents and grandparents, in many cases!). That's one of the many reasons why we left Germany. <br>  <br>  Some possible solutions:<br>  1. Is there an appeal mechanism in the university? If so, give it a try. <br>  <br>  2. Your professor must give you reasons for making you leave: this might not be helpful since she can probably say anything and not the truth. Still, don't make it easy for her by just running away. Stay strong, polite and in control. <br>  <br>  3. It seems to me that your PhD has opened up something important and your professor is feeling threatened ( I have heard of a similar story before). Therefore, can you take the work on the PhD that you have done so far to another university? Poland? USA? England? Take it to those who are experts in your field and see what they say. Tell them you want to complete your PhD. <br>  <br>  4. Collect all the evaluations of your work as a teacher from your students - in writing - and from anyone else at the university who is likely to support you. You will need this. <br>  <br>  I think your best chance is in the USA - at this level of academia, the USA will give you more chances, and you might find a scholarship to get you through the PhD and support your family. <br>  <br>  While you pursue your other options, you must ensure that you stay calm and in control or else if you lose your cool in any way you will make the situation worse by taking the wrong decisions. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, the first thing to do is to submit your PhD work so far to academics in the USA who will know what it is about. Aim for the most well-known universities in your field. Contact the academic in person. I am sure you will know a few academics whose work you respect and who you can trust to understand your work. Explain to them your situation ( keep it factual and non-emotional) and tell them you are seeking the opportunity to complete your PhD with them, or with anyone that they feel would be the best person for you to work with. <br>  <br>  Once more, don't panic. Stay in control of your emotions and think clearly. This is a situation where the ability to think clearly will help you. Retain your self-respect and dignity. You will find a way out. <br>  <br>  Let me know how you are going.|`|L316zgoSaa	i feel awful of your situation. come to america (ca.) get on 1 flght 300- baby is free and get out, here you will find job fast and place to live. i dont know what to do with professors. go to one you trust.

DsOUrvu3aa	i think the two most challenging things that high school students face are friendships and peer pressure. i know these are alike in a lot of ways but they are still very different. like the whole day to day events  from waking up to deciding on what to wear to school totally depends on what high school students' friends are like and who they are. then it determines where to sit at lunch and what to talk about it has a lot to do with teenage life it effects the whole outlook of a students day on who their friends are and how they make them feel. then the peer pressure issue on whether or not to do drugs alcohol have sex or anything. in all honestness. the only way to solve or make these issues more tolerable is to offer maybe confident boosters somehow with friends and better educate teens about the effects they have on each other. as for the peer pressure people such as law inforcers and parents should better regulate the distribution of drugs alcohl and sex education seriously it would prevent so many different harmful and uncomfortable situations|`|7IHV3jUhaa	The main issue is the fact that kids are subjected to taking class after useless class after useless class that have absolutely nothing to do with their future career which in turn causes cheating, academic dishonestly and such other subsequent problems.

An action sequence can use short, almost staccato sentences to keep the action high-paced. Longer sentences slow the reader and the action down or be used to mirror the image you want to create.
FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Sarah,<br>  <br>  The simple answer is because it would be discriminatory.<br>  <br>  It would make you feel bad.<br>  <br>  So that means you have to find another answer.<br>  <br>  Suggestion:<br>  <br>  Make enough copies using A4 paper with students names to be entered and keep them in a folder that you take with you everywhere - meaning you guard it.<br>  <br>  On each sheet you record each students misbehavior. Record Date and Time and note each and every disruption. Ok, so it will involve you in stopping what you are doing each time, however, you won't be able to teach whilst one or more students are disruptive.<br>  <br>  At the end of a day or week you will now be able to go see the Principal or invite a parent to come visit and you will have proof about their child's behavior.<br>  <br>   *It will help if against a student record sheet you noted each time the nature of the disruption, example:<br>  <br>  OT = off task - not doing any work - you can't  <br>            get him to do any work.<br>  Dis = disruptive, student is off-task and is successfully pulling other students off-task.<br>  <br>  Agg = aggressive, student is one who is volatile and agitated, pushing or shoving others.<br>  <br>  Here's the problem: If you go along to see your Principal and simple say, "This group is uncontrollable." S/he may think that you are the problem. <br>  <br>  If you go armed with supportive and descriptive information, then they have to take note and hopefully appropriate action.<br>  <br>  In Tom Daly's Book - Hard Copy, and supporting information that you download from the Internet, Tom has provide sample report forms.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	By not having expectations of the trainees

It doesn't include enough upper-level courses to be considered a major, so you take it along with whatever you do major in.  You'll need to maintain a 3.5 or higher GPA in college to have a shot at med school, so you'll probably have to work a bit harder in college to keep your GPA up than you are now (college classes have much higher expectations).

3OoCiOkAaa	Not worth it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Simply because the fight on a bus is too dangerous . The kid could bump his head on a seat and you could end up be charged with murder or you could injure someone else in this enclosed space. <br>  <br>  You may cause the driver to swerve, kill himself or pedestrians or other motorists. NOT GOOD AT ALL. Many of the kids here probably do not drive. <br>  <br>  Can you imagine how you would feel if  a fight broke out on a bus and someone avoiding your fight fell onto the driver and he killed people due to your dispute.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fighting on a vehicle is one of the most dangerous places to fight as it it endangers so many other people- not involved in your dispute. People are enclosed and they have no way of avoiding your brawling. Where could they run if you fell on top of them you would injure them as well!<br>  <br>  IT is extremely serious so you could be looking at a serious sentence if you injure anyone. <br>  <br>  <br>  The best places to fight are the boxing ring  or wrestling ring. If the hatred is too intense. <br>  <br>  <br>  I would leave this kid alone unless you are prepared to face all the consequences if things go wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  So fighting on a plane, train, bus is always viewed harshly as you are putting other people's lives at risk.  The consequences would be more severe than suspension.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are also not thinking about the driver  as they are responsible for you on the bus. What if they get injured trying to stop the fight. You do know you will be charged and why take it out on the driver.<br>  <br>  So hence fighting on a bus is a selfish place to fight and would be punished accordingly because others are involved. <br>  <br>  <br>  Even if no-one was injured you would most likely be expelled, possibly arrested and banned from riding on the bus company's transport as you are a risk to their employees.  They can decide who they want to carry on their buses and if you are a risk. They can ban you  for life as well as sue your folks. <br>  <br>  I think the answers you have received are probably from kids  who are unfamiliar with many changes in the law.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you need to speak to someone try a counsellor at school- but this isn't worth it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit : <br>  Unfortunate   added in her answer,  someone who fought on a bus went to jail and she was no sure why. It was for the very reasons I have cited. You have been warned fighting on a bus is not a school issue it is a public one. It will not be tolerated.|`|VALxlwYSaa	You could get kicked of the bus a possibly suspended from school. <br>  <br>  And, one time, I saw this kid get into a fight on the bus, he was in high school, and he went to jail.

You shouldn't fight with this kid, 'cause what will happen?  The situation isn't gonna get ameliorated like you wish it will, IT WILL JUST GET WORSE.  You will be found responsible for this, you will make the battle, the disciplinarian of the school will take you to the principal's office, you will be the cause of this inappropriate and bad act on the bus.  But you won't if you don't engage in physical aggression with him.  You should ask whoever you meet, what you should do if this kid keeps bothering you.<br>  You will know what to do, but fighting with this kid is pretty much against the school code of conduct.  <br>  Please keep that in mind.  If you have anything to say about this, please feel free to email me.  My user allows email.|`|qzlDj2claa	Most likely suspended from the bus but it is also possible to get suspened from school as well. Aslo, I was going to do that.

6EoShfYIaa	If you just finished your sophmore year in highschool with a 3.5 GPA.  Then your GPA is 3.5 * 2 years.  If you get a's thats a 4.0.  So if you have 2 years of a 3.5 and your junior year is a 4.0 than you have 3.5 *2 (frosh and soph) + 4.0*1 (junior) / 3 (averageing gpa) than your total gpa after junior year would be a 3.67 which is good.  And then if you get all A's senior year that would be 3.5 *2 (frosh and soph) + 4.0 *2 (junior and senior) / 4 (averageing gpa) than you would have a 3.75 gpa when you graduate.
zgTsCicNaa	Nerds are a form of candy currently sold by Nestlé under their Willy Wonka Candy Company brand.<br>  <br>  Introduced in 1983, Nerds are small sweets that come in a variety of abstract shapes and flavors, (which are usually circle-like, or ovals) and are usually sold in a box that has two separate flavors, each with a separate opening device. Nerds are anthropomorphized on the cover of its distinctive box package. The separation of two distinct flavors in one commodity has generated success for Nerds, likely because consumers can control their experiences. A Nerds breakfast cereal based on this concept appeared in the 1980s, but had a short life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Design<br>   <br>  NerdsNerds are of varied flavors and varied colors, ranging from extremely sweet to extremely sour; often the two flavors in one box will contrast, and a single flavor may even exhibit both extremes. They are thickly glazed with carnauba wax, which gives them a hard bite, and a gloss. The nucleus of each candy is composed of one or more complete sucrose crystals. These optically clear monoclinic crystals are about 0.2–1 mm in length and help define the irregular shape.<br>  <br>  Sour Nerds have recently been produced. The first release contained the flavors Lightning Lemon and Amped Apple. The second released package featured Shocking Strawberry and Electric Blue. There are also 3 more varieties of flavors.<br>  <br>  There are also several Nerds spin-off products by Willy Wonka:<br>  <br>  Giant Chewy Nerds are the newest candy from the Wonka factory. They have a chewy jelly bean center, with a bumpy, crunchy nerd shell. <br>  Nerds Rope consists of a soft candy string with a variety of Nerds attached to the outside, and come in original, berry and tropical flavors. <br>  Rainbow Nerds is a box of regular Nerds of multiple flavors, with no partition or any organization at all. <br>  Jumbo Nerds is a box of regular Nerds of multiple flavors which are much larger than regular Nerds. The box depicts one jumbo nerd on a teeter-totter with several regular sized nerds trying to counter its weight. <br>  Nerds Gum Balls are bubble gum balls filled with multiple flavors of Nerds on the inside. <br>  Theme Nerds are sometimes manufactured seasonally for holidays such as Halloween or Valentine's day with names such as "Spooky Nerds". Flavors can include fruit punch, strawberry, and orange. <br>  Nerds Cereal, a now discontinued breakfast cereal that, like the candy, featured 2 separated flavors to a box. The cereal came with a mail-in offer for a Nerds cereal bowl, which also could be divided in two. <br>  Techno-Nerds, a lesser-well known variety, was composed of three compartments, green, blue, and multicolored. <br>  Nerds Gum, which consisted of pieces that looked like regular Nerds, but were actually bubble gum. The box featured a Nerd floating away with a bubble gum bubble. <br>  Dweebs, a now discontinued soft, chewy version of Nerds released mid-90s, that contained three separate flavors rather than only two. They were available only for a short time. <br>  Neon Nerds were introduced in 1996. <br>  Nerd Jelly Beans for Easter, they make jelly beans with a coating of carnauba wax, which makes it taste like the Nerds itself. <br>  Throughout the 1980s several new flavors of Nerds were introduced from time to time; for example, "Hot and Cold" Nerds (cinnamon & wintergreen flavored), Blueberry and Raspberry, and Lemon and Lime (Blueberry Nerds can still be found in large packages of Rainbow Nerds). One of the most unusual ways of introducing these new flavors to the market was with small, plastic "Nerd" figures/toys (about 2-3 inches in height), which were hollow and contained the candies within. The color of the figure corresponded to the flavor of the candy (also printed on the access cap on the bottom of the toy); it is uncertain how many flavors were produced in this manner, although Citrus Nerds were released through the toy premium. There are very few of the toy figures in existence today, and these would most likely be perceived as collector's items.<br>  <br>  SweeTarts Rope also contains Nerds in its interior.<br>  <br>  Flintstones Push-Up Pops also features nerds inside the ice cream/sherbet treat. Production was halted after two children broke teeth while eating the ice cream treat in two separate incidents.<br>  <br>  ?

In most school districts that kicks you up on the payscale. Since the school district would not have to pay you for any experience, the initial cost to them would be minimal. While you are getting your Master's, concentrate on math & science. Some school districts & states now require 4-6 grade teachers to be specialists in various areas, those are the ones with the highest demand.

05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	Tuxedo pants ride higher than regular pants, so they measured it correctly (across the navel).<br>  <br>  Oh, and congratulations!|`|fsEbaU7vaa	I actually work at the Men's Wearhouse in Asheville, NC, so I can understand your concern.  When I started working here I had no idea where to measure people.  But right across your navel is where your waist is.  Most of the time when I am measuring someone I ask them what size they normally wear, and where they are planning on wearing their tuxedo pants.  Alot of guys wear their dress pants alot lower than you are supposed to... so I always ask where they want their pants to sit... considering you will be wearing them all day... and you are paying to wear them.  The good thing about our tuxedo pants is that they come three sizes to a pant.  For instance: in our system a 34 Regular fits a 33, 34, and 35 inch waist.  So luckily you have the option to go up or down.  Plus dress pants/tuxedo pants run different than jeans.  Hopefully whoever measured you measured correctly but to be safe he should have asked you to try a pair of dress pants on. Just incase he measured incorrectly.  I hope this helps!! Congratulations!!!!!<br>  <br>  p.s. if you think your pants will be too big... go back and have someone else measure you and see if they get a different measurement. It never hurts to be too careful!!!

UOz1LPIHaa	How high-level of a math class is this?  Particularly if it's a freshmen-level class. . . they seem to be whiny in general.  More of them are just overgrown whiny high-school students who think you're still supposed to hand them everything, and this decreases with age and experience.<br>  <br>  I'm certainly not an expert in classroom dynamics as my only major teaching experience has been a few semesters as a lab TA, but it sort of sounds like a couple of these people have figured out that this annoys you.  Annoying the instructor is just fun to some, whether they're 6 or 20.<br>  <br>  I don't know how you can implement this into your style, but I'd probably start, when you respond to any of it, taking the side of the rest of the class who's probably finding this annoying as well -- what might they be saying if they had the floor, since they're too polite to steal it like these other students do?  Be less nice to them if you can still come off as halfway professional when you're doing it.  The rest of the class might start helping you out more with them, and there's nothing like peer pressure to get people to shut up and behave.|`|9531a5e374db145835852e9715fc4e49aa	Every college professor is different.  Some professors will let you know if a certain type of problem is on the test or not.  Not saying you should or shouldn't, but some do.  So kids will try and see if that works with you too.  <br>  <br>  I suggest just making the environment of the classroom to something you prefer.  Ask kids to raise their hands before speaking.  If they ask dumb questions, answer wtih sort of a smart-**** reply.  "Is this questions going to be on the test?"  You reply, "well wouldn't you like to know."  <br>  <br>  As a student though, I always appreciated study guides.  Even if does cover everything, it does help us focus on things and it gives a guide we can follow.  And this will help with loads of questions before a test.  As you can tell them to prepare off the study guide.  I know it's more work for you, but it is appreciated.  <br>  <br>  As for the rude kids.  You are the professor.  You can tell them to be respectful or leave.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wZSvNggVaa	You should start being more strict and kick them out. There is a rule that if you miss a number of classes, you can't take the test and you fail. If they see how serious you are and that you will not take their BS, then they will start having more respect.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry that you have these students. I understand how one feels when you try to be nice and people take advantage of it! Kick them about and show them that you can be nice but you can also be strict. Once they learn the lesson then the will appreciate you more. Not only is it unfair for you but it's also unfair for the students who are actually trying to learn!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this tends do happen a lot in teachers who are more tolerant than others! And please do not let this make you a 'harder' teacher. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you! Hang in there!

Im glad to see that our younger generation is actually worried about their education. Keep up the good work!|`|Q0HEpw3jaa	eh I don't know. Those are awful scores for a high schooler, but it's hard to scale it down since you haven't learned a lot of the material.

AXiKJDV9aa	The are all good.  The problem is getting in.  Regardless of how well you do (and to have a realistic chance you will need virtually an unweighted 4 in rigorous and challenging subjects and well over 2000 SAT's) it will be a crap shoot:<br>  <a href="http://susankayton.com/college.htm" rel="nofollow">http://susankayton.com/college.htm</a><br>  Twenty years ago, it was pretty easy to predict which students would be admitted, since the highly-selective colleges admitted about 1/3 of the applicants. All the bright, interesting kids were admitted back then.  However, nowadays, colleges no longer have room for all the bright, interesting kids since about five times as many kids apply for the same number of slots, so luck plays a huge factor.  If you play tuba and the school's marching band's only tuba player is graduating in June, you might get admitted!  Or they might be looking for a baritone for the men's a capella group.  Or perhaps they need someone from Wyoming so they can boast they have a student from each of the 50 states.  Or you juggle and the admissions officer who's reading your application also is a juggler, so he gives you the thumbs-up.  If you get in, you aren't "better" than the kids who don't get in - you're just luckier.<br>  <br>  IMHO Ivies are not necessarily the best choice to get into medical school (that's where you need to go to be a cardiologist).  A smarter choice would be schools that send a lot of students to graduate school.  Ivy's are OK on that count, but other schools are better.

There is nothing seemingly contradictory abut it except for the way it sounds, as opposed to an oxymoron like 'jumbo shrimp', where there is a clear conflict between the two.<br>  <br>  2.

That said, there are doctors and then there are doctors. If you're hoping to say be a well funded researcher, a top school will aid you. If you want to be a suburban internist, save the money and head to your state college.<br>  <br>  In business a top school makes a huge difference.

Having that network is a big part of why people want to go to these schools.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Its not the same.  Schools that are very selective make their subjects more rigorous, challenging, and of a higher standard than other schools because they have better students.  This will show up in your ability to perform better at an interview, and write a better job application, which in turn will lead to better job prospects.  What students who want to go to graduate school get at more selective schools is a better preparation and better odds of getting in, and able to do better once they get in.  You do not not get paid more,  however the better education will translate into a higher likelihood of a better salary.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|igAFIEk7aa	I don't think students will get paid more. It is simply more prestigious if you say graduated from Yale as opposed to another college. I think if you do well in any college you will be certain to find a higher paying job. Plus, those "better" colleges, are alot more expensive. Why would you want to have an extremely expenisve student loan when you graduate? Unless you can afford it, but it that was the case, then you wouldn't be worrying about how much  money you'd make right?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Most are a blast, and all of them have excellent qualifications. Some of them will even make friends with their students and hang out with them in barrio antiguo (discos).

xI7WpD39aa	Depends on how much stuff you have to work with. If you happen to have a mini-generator lying around, you could turn it with the fan, but not a lot of people do. Otherwise, you could use a lemon.

I also assume you're a minor. This remark is inappropriate, and without knowing the context (but having been around the block a few times) it sounds like he's going to try leading you toward sexually-oriented conversation. If you don't want to go there, it's time to be serious. Ignore the remark and move on to another topic. If he accuses you of being chicken or something, ask him if he wants to keep corresponding with you. Say it without a smile. Say you're surprised he would move the conversation in that direction. Don't preach or scold, just don't participate.<br>  <br>  Now if you want the direction to go that way (You're old enough for legal sex, I assume), ask your most outgoing, unabashed friend for ideas. Also, the comic strip Liberty Meadows has a male chauvinist pig and several cute girls. The girls' put-downs are usually pretty good. (Hey, babe! What's your sign?  It's "stop.")

No respectable college is going to give you a higher GPA than that - and 15-20% of your class work shouldn't count as extra credit.  Sorry, but it just looks like you go to a really easy school.|`|c5UAa65qaa	You're not in high school any more, dude.  Every college or university that I know of, from the Ivies on down, uses a GPA scale that tops out at 4.0.  Anyone who needs to evaluate your grades in detail will look at your transcript and see the A+s there, so chill out.  If you're this stressed about being better than perfect, I shudder to think what'll happen if you get your first A-.|`|UOz1LPIHaa	The college world grades on a 4.0 scale.  You're just used to the idea of getting extra perks for success, when it really should be less credit for lesser work.  No colleges I'm aware of care if it's more than 100%. . . most people do really well just to get a 90%.  Heck, my *high school* didn't even go beyond a 4.0!<br>  <br>  Where in the heck are you even getting the opportunity for such an insane amount of extra credit?  I'm really wondering about the quality of the teaching in these classes if they're even giving you the opportunity to earn that much.  And why don't you go to some harder school if you're that far ahead of your peers?<br>  <br>  If you're going to want a higher GPA scale for better grades, I should start lobbying for a higher GPA scale for tougher majors.  I'm pretty sure I worked MUCH harder for a 3.9 in engineering than some non-engineers with 4.0's. . . .
