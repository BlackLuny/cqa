20090205092335AAlQsdl	Environment;Green Living	What vegetables would you grow on the white house farm?	i hear there is a campaign to turn 5 acres of the white house garden into a farm. i have looked at it on boogle maps, and i reckon this bit with the rubbish looking round pond(? terrace?) is the best bit to use.    http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source...       we could put the greenhouse where that old tennis court is.      i would like new potatoes of course, and i reckon french beans would do very well in the washington climate.       http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/...

20090205095334AA4YBdn	Environment;Global Warming	If carbon levels stabilized at present concentration, how warm would it get?	Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that we were able to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere faster than it's absorbed.  Never mind how we accomplish that (economic crash, nuclear war, pandemic, Al Gore becomes Pope and reveals the 11th Commandment "thou shall not burn rocks," alien invasion, or new and better technology fixes everything), I'm not asking about that.        I'm asking what would happen if CO2 levels stabilize just exactly where they are, at 387 ppm, that Methane stabilizes exactly where it is, too.  This year.  Would the global mean temperature increase or decrease, how quickly, and by how much?      And, more importantly, what's the science behind it?

Now that you have smacked the rescue inhalers out of asthmatics mouths and forced them to pay double for "replacement" lifesaving drugs that don't work (albuterol HFA), shouldn't you get to work abolishing these government programs that pay people to continue ruining the planet by heating with wood, wood pellets and worst of all OIL? Seems like Obama pal Bill Richardson, governor of New Mexico is actually doubling the amount of assistance this year in his state. I wonder why? Isn't it getting warmer everywhere?       http://www.hsd.state.nm.us/files/LIHEAPB...
