AA11500132	GAIA is a scientific theory proposed by James Lovelock to explain the relationship of life and the earth as one system with its own dynamics that evolve over time. <br>  <br>  So what is the GAIA view? It is a chaotic system which describes how life, from the earliest bacteria 3,500,000,000 years ago, affects its environment in such a way as to sustain life. <br>  <br>  James Lovelock came to this theory while researching if there could be life on Mars for NASA. The Martian atmosphere is in a stable chemical equilibrium, which, he argued, indicated that there was no life. Earth's atmosphere, by contrast, is in a dynamic equilibrium; for example the Oxygen has not all combined with the earth's minerals, like rust (one possible reason why Mars is red), but has stayed at a constant percentage of the atmosphere. <br>  <br>  To keep this dynamic equilibrium the GAIA theory argues that positive and negative feedback effects within living organisms and the Earth's systems create a tightly coupled self-organising and self-sustaining environment. <br>  <br>  an early model proof was "daisyworld" where the proportions of black or white daisies changed to maintain optimum planatary temperature with changing solar input, ie as the sun cooled more black plants absorbed more radiation.

UtHnh0aHaa	Many of the second generation re-plantings are now unhealthy or dead because the frost is not killing the beetles You know that. Unless a controlled burn can sterilize the forest, and a new planting can orchestrated, the renewal aspect of the forest is ended. Any new plantings will be infested and the growth for use 30 years from now will not be there. The cycle is broken<br>  <br>  And so sustainability ends for a given economic region with a climate shift. Planting can take place somewhere else where the beetles have not migrated. Eventually a shortage of food and habitat will cause a die off of the beetles and the cycle may return to normal (or at least certain areas will recover).
Vbc60ADyaa	Yes, we do! (we buy recycled paper to begin with. and we also use the flyer paper and envelopes that come in the mail)  ;~) <br>  <br>  And we go a step further by using the paper after too for such things as:<br>  <br>  Origami<br>  <br>  We cut them up and paste them as paper mache (great for pinatas - because they get painted anyway) (we made piggy banks last weekend and had a blast)<br>  <br>  Sometimes on weekends we shred them and make our own paper (I bought a wire mesh tray) so my kids can see how paper is recycled... (Sometimes we also put dried petals from flowers from our garden in there too) We then use the recycled multi colored paper to make invitations, birthday cards etc... <br>  <br>  I love being eco/enviro friendly - it fuels the imagination and makes one think... ! ;~) Plus my kids love arts & crafts ;~)|`|9ilXVowLaa	sure do,if we use paper.<br>  makes good scrap paper.|`|5qIOzchwaa	yes, I always thought it was stupid in school for written assignments to have to be on every other line and no writing on the back. Think of all the trees i was forced to waste throughout my learnin years.|`|encz34GYaa	our teachers used to give more written exams in one semester. but now since we're cutting down and saving the environment, there are more oral examinations given now. :) and some of our research papers are sent online so that we don't have to print them. if we have to print stuff, we use scratch paper (with a blank page on the other side) so that we don't waste too much. :)<br>  <br>  YES. :)|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Generally not. I never hand write anything, I print things, usually it's too much of a pain in the @$$ to flip over a sheet of paper and send it through the printer again.|`|cbeFe1VGaa	No, I don't cut down trees to write on them, I use a computer :}|`|OMHvAdGSaa	Yes. You don't have to go through the trouble of getting out another piece of paper and it's good for the environment :)
AA11932246	1. Skeptic, i.e. I examine the facts and base my conclusions upon the evidence, the evidence clearly points to global warming being fact and also points to our activities as being the cause of it.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, failing to account for improved technology is a very common failing of those who try to predict the future, history is on the side of the Cornucopians and given the technology we now have and what we're likely to have within the next several decades I see no reason to assume that things will be any different.<br>  <br>  Genetic engineering shows great promise to increase crop yields and hydroponics could help as well (there's still a lot of room for improvement in terms of crop yields), a switch from fishing to aquaculture would also be a good idea (and would solve the whole over-fishing problem).<br>  <br>  In the long term of course we'll just move out into space (or maybe upload ourselves into computers).|`|DIBo12zjaa	Again the alarmist belief system is skewed. So much has happen science Malthus thesis, it no longer has a premise. The advent of the Green revolution, and modern medicine has refrained his postulations almost to the point of nonexistence.<br>  <br>  "Death by civilization", that's a new one for me. I would argue just the opposite. To others that think man can't survive in harsh environments. I hate to tell you this, "that's the trade mark for mankind". <br>  <br>  The advocate camp as a whole doesn't express basic biology, ethics, nor science to a knowledgeable level. "It's what they want it to be, not what it is or what it can be"|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	1) The science is overwhelming, the earth is warming due to greenhouse gases emitted by humans releasing long sequestered carbon in fossil fuels.<br>  <br>  2) The only mistake Malthus made was not taking into account the impact that the industrial revolution and the advancements of chemistry.   Today as oil becomes harder and harder to find which means the wheels of the industrial revolution are showing their age, and unless we find new energy sources they will come to a grinding halt.  <br>  Major advancements in chemistry are now more history than news.  We are no longer seeing the new groundbreaking advancements in crop technologies.  We have been able to feed the populations of the earth because of fertilizers, but we are reaching the pinnacle of that invention as was evident of the food shortages earlier this year.  We are now even using valuable agricultural land to to power our machines.<br>  If you look to the oceans to feed people, there too we are we are seeing the limitations of that resource.  The large fish stocks that once fed the human population are no longer there to be caught and we are now relying on what was once considered garbage fish, such a turbot.  We are indeed eating our way down the food chain of the ocean.<br>  Malthus may be late, but he is in no way proven wrong.|`|sSvPEf97aa	There is no overpopulation problem as everyone on the planet could have 5 acres of land.  New Jersey has a higher population density than the planet.<br>  <br>  I wonder if those who think the world is overpopulated have taken action and tied their own tubes.  Most likely these hypocrites want to control others bodies and not their own.<br>  <br>  A typical example is Algore who has his four kids, yet talks about the "evil" of over population.|`|hf27zNgdaa	1) Yes.  I am a proponent of the Sun causing warming.  I am skeptical about global warming .  And I deny that man has anything to do with it.<br>  <br>  3) Yes.  Hooters makes the best hot wings!|`|t1zlbOURaa	1) Skeptic. Extremely.<br>  <br>  2) We're so far from being overpopluated it's really hilarious. Go on an airplane sometime and look at how empty the land is... even in places you think are overpopulated, most of the land is unoccupied.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	I am a scientist so that makes me a skeptic.  Since I consider the odds of this being something harmful about the same as monkeys flying out of Madona's ..., I suppose some non scientific types might call me a denier.  It is pretty obvious it is politically motivated.<br>  <br>  2.  If Malthus is the idiot that wrote the population bomb that was big in the 60's, he has been shown to be flat wrong.  People are not rats in cage that eat themselves to extinction.
2bfeac3da2a44a3900633800c24603b9aa	Well. . . I would love it if cities had composting programs (separate from trash) that pick up grass clippings, leaves, as well as food scraps. They would be kept out of the dump and sent to another location. Then the compost could be used by your city beautification people as green fertilizer for public spaces. . . parks etc. I've heard of cities doing this for the grass clipping & leaves but not daily scraps, and it actually saves them about 20,000 per year as they don't have to pay for someone to take their trash and they don't have to pay for fertilizer. . . my city doesn't do that though. . . : (<br>  <br>  This is something almost on the level of a recycling program--big--but rarely done to my knowledge.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	From the look of most cities I've been to a Pick Up The Trash program could be implemented and no one has had that idea before.|`|UAMtRFruaa	What kind of program?
OzYt1tFRaa	Well global warming isn't real, because the earth is on a cycle. My bestie and I wrote a song about it wanna hear?<br>  Global warming is not real<br>  is not real<br>  Is not real<br>  Global warming is not real<br>  Cause republicans rock!<br>  YAYA<br>  sorry|`|dRVmbSbRaa	The main cause of global warming is carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. When waves and wind mix with ocean water, some of the CO2 in the atmosphere reacts with H20 and forms carbonic acid. This makes the pH of the ocean more acidic, making life difficult for many ocean creatures, especially corals and other sea creatures that have skeletons made out of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) which dissolves more readily in the more acidic waters.|`|JBJUTusFaa	Actually im sure it can. It could overheat the ocean and cause some water to evaporate. This could lower the Sea Level and cause Space Problems for Sea Life.<br>  <br>  From,<br>  <br>  Jessica|`|b7686921e56b1ff0efe1a2d832d46f08aa	Do the research yourself woman.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Warmer waters reduces the amount of oxygen in the water.  I am also a skeptic but I will try to help you out.  Warmer water just moves fish closer to the poles so it is hardly a crisis.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest problems associated with warm water is that it can cause the bleaching and even dying off of coral reefs.  While it is true that bleached corals don't die right away, they will die if they can't get some zooxanthella, which are the algae that live in their bodies to reestablish themselves.   An extended very warm current could kill off an entire reef.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleac...</a>

2v2VZ07uaa	yes, there is no question about it, <br>  if the human population was endangered, everyone would want to save it right? <br>  whats the difference?|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Yes, because many are endangered because of human activity, and without help could become extinct. Some people would argue this is a natural process, and money is better spent on humans than on animals.<br>  <br>  I would say a tiger could be said to be more valuable than a human being, given there are maybe just a few hundred of them, but over 6 billion humans. This sounds a ridiculous argument, but one which has been put into practice in the past. The Kenyan governmment in the late 1980s famously used helicopter patrols to shoot elephant poachers.<br>  <br>  But here is another argument. Poor people poach to earn a living and feed their families.|`|irQMy4Ciaa	I think it is important to help endangered animals because whether you want to believe this is true or not we are all part of the same life cycle and depend on eachother to survive. Yes we need animals too. You wipe out one species you wipe out the rest including us! I think some people would blow it off and say it doesn't matter because they are not aware of how much damage it would do to us to wipe out a species of animals. Not all animals are helpful to us no, but they are helpful to animals like deer, bear, and those types of animals that hunters will hunt for food(I'm against hunting but a lot of ppl do it because they can't afford food) If you take away the predators food, you take away the predator, you take a way the predator a lot of people starve and eventually we will all be extinct and there will be no more life. I learned this in Biology that we are all part of the same life cycle and we need eachother in order to live.|`|z8s6xNLCaa	Yes, it is very much important.<br>  <br>  People say it's unimportant because they just care about themselves. They don't realize how much endangered animals suffer in this world. Polar bears are trying to stay on the face of the earth by swimming and swimming and they get so tired the drown trying to find an iceberg to rest on. Gorillas are being killed brutally by poachers, their babies have no parents so they cannot thrive in the wild. This is why we need to care more about our endangered species.|`|SjGpbohiaa	Yes it is. But i don't know why.
pQfaHAbraa	Only a small percentage of all plastic products (not just bags) can be recycled, that is, reprocessed onto the same product. Most plastics can only be downcycled, which means they can be reprocessed onto plastic fencing or such after which they will go to landfill.<br>  <br>  Some supermarkets may accept plastic bags for downcycling but curbside recycling cannot accept them because they are not dense enough or big enough to be sorted in a reprocessing facility. <br>  <br>  Things that damage plastic bags so they cannot be downcycled at all, is if they are contaminated with oil or sugar for example. Foods like these would render all the plastic in the batch useless.<br>  <br>  You can do a little google and find loads of pages that explain all this and more. Learning about it has actually changed the way I shop. I now take plastic packaging in consideration. I avoid plastic in general if non packaged or non plastic alternatives exist. If I can buy beans in bulk, I prefer that over tofu which comes in plastic. It is beans after all. I also buy yogurt in returnable glass bottles instead of the individual plastic cups.|`|TwBlfXPQaa	Most plastics can be pyrolyzed to Styrene, Acetylene, or many other useful compounds and even fuel sources.... but until recently, there were no bacterial strains known to biodegrade plastic, and none are sufficiently present in nature, so if you bury plastic, it will not decompose, but anyone who runs a pyrolysis plant will tell you that everything is recyclable.|`|Qd0m1du9aa	It's plastic|`|573Q4zCpaa	its not biodegradable meaning it just will sit in a land forever|`|gGYsRXgHaa	Some or most of the hard plastics are made of PVC whick in theory can be recycled. Number 5 recycling. But most cities only go up to 2 recycling.. Which is like plastic bottles. It depends on the company that makes the bags. Go paper then recycle them or reuse them like to make book cavers for school or has a garbage in a car.
AA11932246	Some engines might not like it, you also have to do a bit of work to convert the waste oil into something your truck can run on.<br>  <br>  You might void the warranty (or you might not, that's something you'll need to look at).<br>  <br>  You'll also need to fill out some extra paperwork just to ensure that you are paying the fuel tax (otherwise you could be done for tax evasion, it has been known to happen).|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	no this has been done by quite a few people and works perfectly well.<br>  cost to do it will be recouped eventually.<br>  and if you don't mind the smell of mc donald or kentucky fried chicken coming out of your tail pipe, you will be fine and green!|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Salt in the oil will rust everything up if you don't remove it somehow.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Downside #1--if you want to run in cold weather (below 40F) you'll need a second, heated fuel tank, and you'll still have to start on real diesel or biodiesel.  The two-tank install costs a couple thousand dollars, maybe a few hundred if you can do all the fabrication yourself.<br>  Downside #2--you have to collect the waste oil.  Which means handling messy gunk, and also dealing with restaurant managers who may or may not care.  Pumps and storage containers aren't free either.<br>  Downside #3--you have to filter it, or it will gum up your injection pump (this is major damage).  Filters aren't free.<br>  Downside #4--there are potential hassles with the road tax.  In some countries it's actually illegal, and no telling what your local government will do with the issue during the next several years.<br>  Upside:  The fuel is essentially free, and much closer to carbon-neutral.  WVO vehicles often run smoother and quieter, as well as potentially cleaner.|`|npBCankMaa	thousands of dollars worth of downside.  You don't say which way you want to run it, so you must not be very technical savvy.<br>  <br>  If you go with biodiesel, you'll have the cost of filtering and conversion to biodiesel along with handling the hazardous waste.  Biodisel turns to a solid and can not be used at temperatures below 40 F. <br>  <br>  If you want a greaser can you'll have to do several thousand dollars in conversion.  grease cars only run on it after the engine has run on normal diesel for a hour or so,<br>  <br>  In both cases, you will have to pay your fuel taxes of about $.50/gallon every 3 months.  If you don't keep good records, they will tax you odometer assuming you run pure bio diesel.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	its better than regular diesel. you get better fuel economy AND better performance!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  but here's the big downside, you have to refine the vege oil. you can't just put in straight vege oil because there are some chemicals in the oil that will contaminate your fuel lines or something. you also have to change your rubber hoses to something else because biodiesel and rubber don't work well with each other.<br>  <br>  also, biodiesel starts to gel at higher temperatures than regular diesel, but the temperature is only like 10 degress.<br>  <br>  <br>  but then there are some places that sells biodiesel...but it won't be free.<br>  <br>  <br>  if you know how to refine vege oil into biodiesel, i'd say to go for it! you'll save money, the enviornment, and you'll have a much more powerful truck!!!|`|oNg8zGi8aa	In cold weather it will gel . You will have to add an additive to thin it out .|`|gGYsRXgHaa	One of the weird things that i saw on dirty jobs about that is that the exaust smells like the food they make. So the guy on dirt jobs got his oil at a taco place. So his exaust smelled like tacos. But that may not be a downside to you. It may not be as powerful. But it should be fine. You should look into it though.|`|Wn6jOYbdaa	The only downside is that the motor has to run at a slightly higher temperature than usual, but not much more, but other than that it will probably be better because there won't be as much carbon build up... and you'll always smell burgers and fries!|`|FR0manFQaa	no there isn't any downsides but it's actually better for your truck,the environment and your wallet
