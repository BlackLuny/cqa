It'll improve.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my solution is for people to take better care of themselves and they would not need so much health care. If we do have such health care, we need to completely eliminate narcotic drugs from being purchased.  There are too many drug addicts that go to Dr after Dr after these pills.  It is so easy for people to keep breeding off children if they do not have to worry about cost to care for these children.  What is stopping the whole country from have child after child and letting the tax payers take care off it?  Do you realize with universal health care you will wait for months to see a DR because of the high abundance of others who are also seeing the DR.s? My family has managed to electively live for years without health insurance.  All my children are perfectly healthy.  They do not need to insesively run to the DR for every sneeze and sniffle.  We pay for glasses, and dentist and DR out of pocket.  It is cheaper.|`|VK0brk89aa	Affordable. There is nothing affordable with Universal Health Care as your asking Americans to foot your share of your health care policy.<br>  <br>  Why don't you look at the Millions of People who are responsible and are not having a problem?<br>  <br>  What is wrong with asking Government to help make Health Care Policy's Run Better without taking control of it.<br>  <br>  BTW I don't believe what you wrote and for all we know your a Liberal being paid to write this for your cause as it's a cause for all Americans.<br>  <br>  It seems a few bad liberal grapes ruin it for everyone.<br>  <br>  When I didn't have Insurance I still went to the Doctors and asked to have my bill reduced and they did.

Did you buy that off of a Captain Crunch box?|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	All I can say is if you think health insurance is expensive now, just wait until its free.<br>  <br>  <br>  My solution is to have government get their hands off the medical industry completely, and have insurance companies only pay for things that should be unforeseeable, the way car insurance does. Is getting a checkup or getting refills on your prescription pills unforeseeable? Absolutely not! In the same way that getting an oil change for your car isnt unforeseeable. Do you see your insurance company paying to get your brakes changed, or your oil changed? Well medical insurance should act in the same way. This would allow the free market to dictate prices instead of the government and insurance companies, and you know when there is a free market in play, it allows for competition, and that naturally lowers prices. Insurance and government give you no incentive to go look around for an inexpensive doctor, and they give the doctor no incentive to charge you less. And so naturally you will be paying the maximum even though it is going to be indirect. And also, dont forget that the government will be playing middle man, and that will also bump up the cost more than it needs to be raised. Not to mention if insurance only covers the unforeseeable, your insurance would be much lower too. It isnt coincidence that medical costs have gone up a few hundred percent over the past few years, while other medical expenses which are not covered by the government or insurance, like rhinoplasty, have been drastically reduced, even  accounting for inflation. Lastly government should allow other companies to create generics of prescription pills so Americans have a choice on what to buy. This would drastically lower medical costs.|`|gmaCvh00aa	I think we have to start with cracking down on the overpriced cost of health care set by greedy doctors.<br>  <br>  We pay exhorbitant prices for checkups and procedures and they live in mansions and belong to expensive country clubs.<br>  <br>  You may not realize it, but most of the time when your doctor sends you for some kind of test, which you may not really need, like a bone density test, for example, it's because they own a piece of the testing facility.  A few years ago a woman who had worked for an OB/GYN testified in Congress about this specifically-- the doctor was sending women with ovarian cancer for bone density tests, when they were never even going to live long enough to develop osteoporosis.  A few years back I had a friend who worked in Washington for a Senator and she was always going on trips and to dinners paid for by the American Medical Association.  The AMA owns our Congress.<br>  <br>  Regulate the prices in conjunction with finding a way to get health insurance for those who can't afford it.  Until then, don't get sick and don't get talked into unnecessary tests and treatments.|`|x97ktCqwaa	Get another job.  If you can't get another job, then develop something.  You need to be creative and be able to think outside the box.<br>  <br>  Don't just sit there and wait for handouts.<br>  <br>  Health care would be affordable if we weren't catering to the ILLEGAL ALIENS that are a blight on our society and take up resources which they are not entitled to.  If they weren't visiting our ERs or our OB clinics we would have plenty of money for our citizens.  When they don't pay back their hospital bill EVERYONE ELSE pays for it by the increase cost of health care.  How many Californian hospitals went under because of this BS?  Last I heard it was something like 80 or so and THAT was 2 years ago!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  JohnA...That is BS.  They will just pocket the change and still layoff people as they go.  That is the same idea as the "Trickle Down Theory!"  Nice thought, until people see reality!|`|LqBIKJbcaa	The government can't manage a ham sandwich, never mind something impotant like my health.

A previous answerer was correct, you need to shop around.  If you think that health care is expensive now, just wait til it's "free".<br>  <br>  In Canada, they are barely satisfied with the every day care.  Heaven forbid you need surgery or a specialty type of care!  For that, there is long waiting lists and coming here anyway to have the procedure done.<br>  <br>  I find that the people that are "all for universal health care" are largely healthy, are on a group plan that covers 90% or more of their expenses, or have a pre-existing condition that makes them ineligible for an individual policy anyway.  So, either way, you're dealing with a warped perspective.  And don't even get me started on the Teachers in Unions!!!!  They are whacked in their "first dollar coverage for EVERYTHING with absolutely NO DEDUCTIBLE for anything" mentality.|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	My husband and I haven't had health insurance in almost 2 years now after he was laid off from his job. We are now both self employed so insurance companies want to charge well over $1000 a month for coverage which we can not afford.<br>  <br>  We are in the bracket that we make too much money to get any state assistance and not enough money to afford it ourselves so if anything does happen to us we will pay thousands out of our pockets.<br>  <br>  Hopefully we're healthy enough to get through this until we make more money to pay for insurance or get so sick we can just get on medicaid which I would be appalled if we had to do because I don't to be a part of the welfare system.<br>  <br>  I would welcome a Goverment health care plan because at least I'd get to see a doctor even if it meant waiting months.

Rather than government controlled health care which would ruin our health care of today by restricting many of new drugs and they would cut health care by cost.  Meaning your health care would put you more like a cow going through a cattle run.  I would like to see insurance be lowered on your ability to pay basis.  The insurance companies already hinder our health requests but not as bad as the gov. would.  lets face it the gov. has no oversight.  The pharmaceutecal co. and ins. co are making big bucks.  For ex. You have an MRI and they submit the bill to the ins co for$3,000. but the ins. co only pays $500 because they have a contract with the doctor.  Somehow those uninsured should get the same break.  Something needs to be done but we do not want to Nationalize Health care through the gov.  Look at the VA's. Look how many people come to the U.S. to receive health care here because it would be months in their socialized country.  Would you like to have a doctor who graduated first in his class to do open heart surgery or one who graduated last.  That choice would be taken away.  We loose our freedoms everytime the gov. gets involved.  FYI- my Dr. is retiring April  1st, still young in her early fifties, why I ask.  She does not want to practice medicine with her hands tied by regulations.  That would be against the oath she took when she became a Doctor.

As a Conservative I look for someone that believes in Personal Responsibility for all people, helping the poor does not mean giving them their monthly hand outs but teaching them a trade they can excel at and contribute positively to society. I look for people that will spend our tax money wisely for our city/state/country and hopefully lower our taxes too (I would much rather see our money spent wisely though first and foremost). I want someone that isn't going to create more bureaus of whatever to dictate mine, my family's or anyone else's life...

A candidate's religious beliefs (or lack thereof) are irrelevant to me.<br>  <br>  Granted, if a religious leader is adamantly pro-life, I can see why they would advocate that their congregation should vote for that person if the congregation shares those values.  That said, I don't believe that a religious leader should use their pullet to preach politics.<br>  <br>  I am Jewish.  My husband is Lutheran.  And although we are both conservative, I am somewhat pro-choice.  This comes from a personal experience that my Mom had when she miscarried a baby, but although the baby died, she did not go into labor on her own.  Her doctor (at a Catholic hospital) refused to induce labor and forced her to carry the dead baby inside her for 3 weeks until she went into labor naturally.  She got a life-threatening infection and could have died because of that.  Therefore, I will never be completely against abortion.<br>  <br>  Most people are not single issue voters.

Just as shocking are the people who are willing to blindly accept this idea that Government is the answer.

K2ecmzInaa	New Federalism is a political philosophy of devolution, or of transfer of certain powers from the United States federal government to the U.S. states. The primary objective of New Federalism, unlike that of the eighteenth-century political philosophy of Federalism, is the restoration to the states of some of the autonomy and power which they lost to the federal government as a consequence of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and federal civil rights laws of the 1960s.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Old Communism.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	It's an attempt to return to the bad old days before the Civil War and the post-war Amendments to the Constitution more or less settled the issue of which set of laws should be supreme.  The doctrine seeks to devolve power to the states as though they were miniature sovereign countries, which they of course are not.  The opposite of New Federalism would, of course, be New Republicanism, which seeks to abolish the myth of "state's rights" entirely and create a unitary republic on the current territory of the USA.|`|bZy74U06aa	Federalism has to do with individual states' rights.

These were original to the United States Constitution not after the Civil War.

Amnesty was done in the 80's and was a complete failure. All it did was reward criminals and that is surely not the answer. More and more U.S. tax paying citizens are becoming aware of the burden illegals put on them and the majority will not stand for another amnesty.

That same task can be handled with respect and honor.  How I feel about the photos will be entirely based on how that photo was taken and used after printing.<br>  <br>  My objection to the refusal to allow the photos is that it isolates the families and soldiers in their grief and loss.  This is denying reality.  This loss is not just a loss to a family or a unit.  These brave soldiers represent a loss to our entire nation. <br>  <br>  Denying the opportunity to take those photos was not an attempt to protect the grief stricken, but rather an attempt to disguise the real cost of blood for our military commitment.  <br>  <br>  A lot of us were upset about the cost in dollars to our treasury that are routinely if not easily available.  It is the lesser of the two costs.  We can raise more money.  We can never replace the sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers who have given their lives.<br>  <br>  If publishing the photos of the caskets returning to US soil helps make that cost clear to the public that so far has not born the cost, then that publication is a good thing.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I believe that the families will have a say in the matter.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Socialism means the reorganization of economic life under the democratic control of the actual producers, the working people whose labor creates all wealth. It can come about only through the independent political mobilization of the working class, led by a revolutionary party, which establishes a new and far more democratic form of state, a workers' state, which exercises ownership and control over the means of production. Socialism cannot be engineered through backroom deals between Wall Street bankers and Washington politicians, or through the policies of any Democratic or Republican politician.<br>  <br>  Some 160 years ago, Karl Marx wrote, "A specter is haunting Europe, the specter of communism." He was describing the mood of fear and trepidation in the European ruling classes on the eve of the great revolutionary wave of 1848, even though the number of conscious revolutionary socialists was still a relative handful. If the specter of socialism today haunts the American ruling class, despite decades in which socialism has been subjected to an unrelenting campaign of slander and vilification, it is likewise because the profit system faces a new period of revolutionary upheaval<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct2008/pers-o23.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct200...</a><br>  <br>  Obama defends the for profit system, that by definition makes him a capitalist|`|3a082722cea27ba378a88a859b07202daa	I hate to use this example and please, no offense is intended. Hitler hated socialism but was quick to head to federalism. He was never a socialist. I think a good argument could be made that this president will be pushed into federalism for a time and it could be a better choice to go to socialism. I would rather we went to a percentage socialism-capitalism/ democracy. It is our right to vote for the mix we like and why not just accept we need just a little of it but I was wandering.<br>  Taking a controlling position in the banks, big corporations, insurance, and some state governments is federalist not socialist.

Who do you think the current laws therefore benefit the most?<br>  <br>  Some people are in trouble because they were irresponsible.  That's certainly true.  But are we so keen to punish them that we just won't care about the people who WERE responsible but, through no fault of their own, got laid off?  Or sick?  Or defrauded?

TYGgRjqDaa	I don't believe paying out remaining vacation is the law in many states.  You need to go back and check your employee handbook.|`|AA10465540	Giving notice is quitting.  Vacation pay is dependent upon any contract with the employer.  Your former employer is not necessarily required to give you hours after you have served notice.|`|3tuwWidiaa	Your employer does not need to allow you to work 2 weeks.  Once you resign, they can make you end date immediate.  That's actually very common in certain fields and with certain jobs.<br>  <br>  However, there are laws that may require you to be paid your outstanding vacation.  Check with your state's (OH) labor department.  This is a common issue and I guarantee they'll have someone that's all but dedicated to assisting with this issue.<br>  <br>  But, no, they do not have to let you work two weeks.<br>  <br>  And, no, if you quit, you can't collect unemployment (usually).  There are exceptions, but I'm guessing that this is not one of them.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Quitting a job voluntarily means you can't collect unemployment.<br>  <br>  You also are only entitled to your vacation accrual if your contract says you were - most likely not.  They don't have to give you any hours, either.<br>  <br>  If your employer refuses to pay you for hours you actually worked, then you have a legitimate complaint.

But the easiest thing to do is ""Shop at another store , ... and forget about that one.|`|AA12330575	Retail shops are private property and as such, can demand that anyone leave the premises and refuse to serve any person as long as it is not because of race, creed or color.  If they don't like your clothes or the way you comb your hair, they are perfectly within their rights to tell you to get out and never return to their place of business.

The problem is there are some 16 year olds not ready to have sex while some are. The law can't pick and decide who can and cannot have sex so that's why everyone gets lumped together. In the US the age of consent varys from state to state ( which I think is crazy). A moral issue should not depend on my location. In some states a 15 year old can have sex with anyone he or she wants and I think that is wrong (if the person is like 90).

Remember. it's illegal for government employees to strike.<br>  <br>  It's a little known fact. When the economy is good, there is a shortage of nurses. Most nurses are women. Women don't need to work when their husbands are making enough money to support the family. As times get worse and worse, more nurses who are idle, start back to work.<br>  <br>  When we have socialized medicine, there will be no hospitals competing for patients so they will all be standardized to the lowest cost level politicians can get away with.

MOALBorJaa	Why did you stay at the party once she started treating you as she did? Why in God's name did you go home with her? Why didn't you call your room mate to pick you up from the party once things started going badly? Have no further contact with her. You may have to go to your boss and explain there was an incident and the two of you need to be kept as separate as possible. If she calls the police about the camera say nothing until you get a lawyer, but I would advise them you never stepped foot in the house that night. Your room mate should be able to corroborate that you did not have a camera on you when she picked you up.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Beat her to the punch.

There she will have to bring some kind of evidence to support her claim. You bring you're witness(s) to prove her wrong. This will 1; let her know that you aren't letting her get away with threatening you. 2; It will show her that you possibly didn't take her things because if you were guilty you wouldn't have brought her to court. And 3; it will show everyone you mean business. Some times it is the quickest way and the only way to solve an issue. The court coast will be around $100 and she has to pay it if she loses the case. And if you loose time at work because of mental stress she will have to pay for you're time off too.|`|2lFRYr8Eaa	It would be impossible to make a decision without hearing from the other sides.

TJpQZju2aa	Although government data on this subject is poor, a review of the last 300 bankruptcy cases in Arkansas showed a medical bill in half of them. According to the New York Times, bankruptcy lawyer Danielle Walker estimates that 40% of her clients have medical problems that caused them to file. This is direct evidence of high health care costs forcing people into poverty.<br>  <br>  A nationalized health insurance program would solve this problem by providing health care for everyone regardless of their ability to pay.<br>  There are 16.1 hospital beds per 1000 population in Canada compared to 4.4 per 1000 in the U.S. Canadians get more doctor visits, more hospital stays, more procedures and better health care in general than Americans, regardless of income.<br>  I want to stress that nationalized health insurance is NOT socialized medicine, but socialized insurance. There are other essential services that the US has socialized such as: retirement income support or Social Security, police protection, fire departments, and the military. The point is to provide services to all. Everybody has an equal right to them. The fire department doesn't refuse to put out a poor man's flaming home. Similarly, poor people should not be refused health care simply because they are poor<br>  In the Canadian system, since all patients are covered by government insurance, their is no incentive to undertreat poor people. In America, however, poor people are often given inadequate treatment or no treatment at all because treating the poor is not profitable. The Canadian health system treats for health, not for profit.<br>  <br>  The U.S health care system is a profiteering enterprise concerned with making money and not with treating patients. Corporations are making medical decisions behind closed doors, as well as decisions on physicians' fees and working conditions with only one thing in mind: increase profits. The HMO system of health care which is the American example of "competition" and "freedom of choice" therefore only restricts quality and access to health care. <br>  A Canadian health care system would eliminate much the bureaucratic waste that plagues the American system. According to the General Accounting Office of the US congress, the savings from consolidating the bureaucracy of the U.S. health care system into one such as the Canadian system would be upwards of $100 billion annually. Without increasing the total amount of money spent in the US on health care, this money could be redirected to pay for the costs of including everyone, rich or poor, in a nationalized insurance program that could even cover co-payments and deductables. The Canadian system simply offers more for your money: more and better care than US HMOs, at a lower cost.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Because the cost of what we have is excessive.  It is a burden not only on the workers, but the employers as well.  The cost in pain and suffering for those unable to get insurance after losing their job, or because of pre existing conditions is destroying our economy. There are many other reasons, but I will leave it up to you to do the research needed if you truly want to know.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	Because the system that we have now does not work.  <br>  <br>  I have not heard a single solution to this problem by a republican..|`|liHpJvVfaa	We don't need it. Do you really want the government to tell you if you can or can not get surgery that you desperately need? Talk to anyone in any other country that has this form of health care and they will all tell you how much they hate it. Many of them come over to the US so they can get the care they need and pay it out of there own pocket. I was listening to Neal Bortz one day and he was telling stories about ppl in Canada that are having these very issues because of "Universal Health Care" One man was 56 and needed a hip replacement. They denied him health care because he was too old to reap the benefits of a hip replacement. What kind of bull s*it is that? I pray to god that this never goes into effect. And if it does, we are in a world of trouble.|`|a7758985bc328f86aea63a86e0cd5cfdaa	If for no other reason to get a grip & some control of the abuses of the American medical "machine'<br>  A well protected, self serving monopoly.<br>  We are living under the misconception that we are the best at everything .<br>  Other countries deliver healthcare as good and better thab what we have.<br>  Big business as usual.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	If you removed GM's health care liabilities, the company would become profitable overnight.  Imagine how much money we could save if we weren't busy trying to bail out GM.<br>  <br>  If you stopping funding the VA and Medicare separately, the whole wounded veterans' scandal would've never happened.<br>  <br>  Not having socialized health care is a massive drain on America's competitiveness.  There is no reason, other than a fluke of history, that health insurance should be tied to one's job.  We spend more on health care than any other country on the planet, but we don't have the lowest infant mortality rate, the longest lifespan, or any other indicator of good public health.<br>  <br>  We ration healthcare too.  But the way WE do it is by giving healthcare to those who have the money to pay for it, and not giving it to those who are poor.  Is that more fair to you than how Canada does it?  Because in most civilized countries, it's the most seriously ill who get treated first.  And Blondie8, below me, makes the typical dishonest argument: she has never spoken to a single person who lives in a country with socialized medicine, but she pretends to know something about it.  The truth?  None of my friends in Canada or the UK would trade what they have for what we have.  None of them.  They think we're nuts.|`|J3Y3HO7Kaa	Because there are too many people without healthcare or find healthcare too expensive.  I feel really bad for the elderlies who have to pay so much for medicine.<br>  <br>  Even though I did not vote for Obama, I think that we do need nationalization of healthcare, but also offer private docs as well, so people can have both. Either they can get it for free with a long waiting process or pay out of their pocket for a private doc.  Just like how the gov't offers public defenders.

He can afford it with his wages ,but most of us don't make anywhere near that. I heard today how he gave a set date to pull out troops,but nothing about Bin Ladin the reason the war was really started over. It is bad to announce to the enemy when we will pull out all troops,as the enemy can now sit back and wait until all troops are out and cause even more chaos than before. I am sure he means well though.|`|EnODJeIcaa	IT WAS SCARY!

qaiYanF2aa	Well, we have seen that communism nor socialism work at all to produce a thriving happy population.  A Theocracy can be good but our most recent example is Iraq and other mid-Eastern countries and they don't look to prosperous either.  Monarchy?  Well, in some traditional monarchies the rulers have had absolute power but England seems to have done some pretty strange things with their constitutional monarchy.. So I am wondering why you did not include the only successful forms of government - a republic or a democratic republic?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately almost all dictatorships finally boil down to totaltarianism - <br>  <br>   Totalitarian regimes or movements maintain themselves in political power by means of an official all-embracing ideology and propaganda disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that controls the state, personality cults, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of free discussion and criticism, the use of mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror tactics.<br>  <br>  For some scholars, dictatorship is a form of government that has the power to govern without consent of those being governed, while totalitarianism describes a state that regulates nearly every aspect of public and private behavior of the people. In other words, dictatorship concerns the source of the governing power (where the power comes from) and totalitarianism concerns the scope of the governing power (what is the government). In this sense, dictatorship (government without people's consent) is a contrast to democracy (government whose power comes from people) and totalitarianism (government controls every aspect of people's life) opposes pluralism (government allows multiple lifestyles and opinions). Though the definitions of the terms differ, they are related in reality as most of the dictatorship states tend to show totalitarian characteristics. When governments' power does not come from the people, their power is not limited and tend to expand their scope of power to control every aspect of people's life.<br>  <br>  We are already sliding in this direction with Obama's control and influence over the media.  What's next?|`|f0bb213732f5c2ceb3db8c6b3def0573aa	Dictatorship is never better than other forms of government.<br>  <br>  Your list does not include the best form of government - democracy.

With fewer/more costly loans, demand will not meet the supply and the suppliers would have to cut costs and overcapacity.<br>  <br>  Look at the history of higher education in this nation and the flow of federal money.   This nation was born in a tradition of education and seeking it.   Local schools one taught careers and trades up-until the 50's when a level of jealousy came visible.   <br>  <br>  After WWII, this nation agreed to send the men and women of that war to any college that they could get into.   We produced engineers, doctors, PhD second to none.   We also encouraged trade /vocational technical schools.

The desire to reduce every complex issue to a simple personal story is demagogy. Ultimately demagogy benefits the right wing because it leads people away from intellectual discourse and critical thinking to a place of 'common sense' and cheap one liners.

UvzKiis0aa	No, it can't.  It worked to get Blagojevich out so they will continue until Burris goes.  It is all partisan jocking for power and position.<br>  <br>  It's pretty ironic considering the criminal David Vitter who patronized the DC madam so often his number was on her speed dial is the one calling for it.  Senator Ted Stevens was taking bribes, tried and convicted and he was never asked to leave.  <br>  <br>  It is doubly ironic in Illinois, because the governor before Blagojevich was tried and convicted of taking bribes for commercial drivers' licenses.  George Ryan (R) was the Secretary of State before he became governor and he was stuffing cash in his pockets for years, caused many accidents, deaths and the State of Illinois many lawsuits because of his corruption.  Georgie got to serve out his complete term because Patrick Fitzgerald (R) decided to hold off on indicting him until after his term was over.  Blago wasn't even indicted, much less convicted and he was out.  I don't know of any deaths because of his power mongering.<br>  <br>  But Repubes have a higher standard of corruption when it comes to the other party.  I wish the Dems would take a page out of their books and either defend their people like the Repubs do or start calling for the ouster of people like Vitter.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	And allow someone who has been appearing to lie (I only say appearing as I do believe in him being able to prove it - however, he has done the opposite thus far) to stay as a representation.  <br>  <br>  He needs to show how he is innocent of this then.  I supported his right to take the seat even though Blago was on his way out - I supported the right fro him to take the appointment.

wbJXqkVGaa	I have not watched the movie Slumdog and do not know what is it all about. But I know for a fact that Iranian cinema is very good & makes good movies. You hear more about Indian movies because they work on people's libido. Iranian movies are realistic and truly show human suffering and struggle on a day to day basis;-)<br>  <br>  Iranian movies win many awards in Cannes, France.;P|`|4fqaQRnIaa	I guess it would help a little.  Iran's really quite a beautiful place  The real problem for Americans vision of Iran is the continued lies about Iran perpetuated by our lousy popular media and political BS.<br>  <br>  The other trouble is that Americans can't understand Iran's democracy because of the power of religion in the country too.  It is interesting to note that the biggest worriers of the Islamic religious power within Iran are the Fundamentalist Christians who want that same power given over to them in America.<br>  <br>  The other problem is their democratic leader.  He's not much brighter than either Bush was I'm afraid but at least he's not screaming evil empire like the Bush's and Reagan liked to do.<br>  <br>  The other problem was the Hostage affair.  It has been made to believe that this was the work of Iran when clearly it was a very angry Iranian group.  It is unfair that Americans can't seem to figure this out.<br>  <br>  Why were they angry?  Well, the US and the UK got rid of the Iranian democratically elected leader and cause him to be put in jail.  Why?  Because the UK was not paying the royalties on oil as they'd agreed and Mosandeq moved to nationalize Iran's oil rather than to continue being cheated.  The US is great at killing democracies!  This was 1953.  The UK and the US replaced Iranian democracy with the cruel Shah of Iran who caused the murders of many democratic thinking Iranians.  This went on for a couple of decades, I believe.<br>  <br>  Then, in the 80s Reagan helped, encouraged Saddam orf Iraq to invade Iran.  Iraq did so and killed with one strike of poison gas 3.000 Iranian defenders on Iranian soil.  Iraq's Saddam was backed up by CIA efforts in Iran, manny US military advisers on the ground and information about Iranian troop movements From US spy satellites.  If I were Iranian I'd be supremely angry with the rogue US and UK!  What a bunch of -holes.<br>  <br>  Where did Iraq's poison gas and delivery system come from.  I've seen no indication they could do this on their own in Iraq.  They couldn't even care for the stuff they had stockpiled and no delivery systems have been found and they didn't use the Russian made Scuds.|`|EMPVIFmLaa	Perhaps.  Interesting, though that the heros of the film are muslims, persecuted by hindus.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, it definitely could help.|`|AA10236380	Yes, an entertaining movie from Iran that shows them as normal, decent human beings would help with world opinion, but I don't think that's the problem.  Most of the world already realizes that the average Iranian is a decent enough person; it's their repressive, theocratic, totalitarian government that we all have a problem with.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, a realistic depiction of Iranian life would have to reflect their government's repressive tactics, just like a realistic depiction of life here in America would have to reflect our societal problems with racism, substance abuse, etc.<br>  <br>  But -- I'm free to worship (or not worship) as I please, to say what I want - including critizing my government - and to make my own choices with regards to my job and my lifestyle.  Few Iranians enjoy that same level of freedom.|`|ab406a9a5d69ca0d2cc95e30217f543aaa	You think image is the problem?

Then, stop threatening to annihilate other nations. Then, stop funding terrorists in Gaza. Then, stop funding terrorists in Lebanon. Then, stop funding terrorists in Iraq. Lastly, stop trying to get the atomic bomb, because you're never gonna get it.|`|qfH0k0t2aa	I say put those beautiful Persian women in bikini's.|`|pFlvqhhjaa	'Slumdog' was a British film|`|wz9szz3Gaa	I don't think it's a bad idea but India is more open than Iranian's! <br>                                              Ciao Dino !!!|`|tDvyf3Q5aa	Iran cinema is one of the known artistic cinemas around the world and honored in many festivals, but due to restrictions inside and sometimes outside the country, popular movies that can raise the global opinions about Iran are not produced unfortunately. the answer would be yes; having a powerful popular cinema like Hollywood can simply change the opinions.
3YRrGfkiaa	The tax increased won't affect any business making less than $250k in profits a year.  And taxes are ONLY on profits, not on revenues.  Why don't people know this?<br>  <br>  Edit:  Sigh.  You're using equivocation.  Let's review:<br>  <br>  You said: 90% of the people who will be affected by Obama's tax plan are small business owners.<br>  I said: most small businesses don't make more than $250,000 a year in profits.<br>  <br>  Do you see why these are not the same thing?  If you are trying to argue that a lot of the money is going to come from small business owners, then your point is an important one.  If, however, you're going to argue that most small business will be affected by the reversion to the old tax scale, then your point is irrelevant.|`|07ad7f1a558394efa73cf9e95d1d6fe8aa	It won't but it will help support those who would rather stay at home instead of looking for a job.

5rXzu0IWaa	If you have more people than what are required to do profitable work you should lay them off or cut their hours even if you pay no taxes. A small business i not a charity. You should keep every employee that is making your money regardless of tax rate.<br>  <br>  Now if you are going to fire people that are making you money because you have to pay taxes on a percentage of the profits you make. That makes no sense. <br>  <br>  <br>  Example: <br>  <br>  Employee makes you say $100,000.00 per year.<br>  <br>  Tax are 100,000 * .42 or 42,000 in taxes<br>  <br>  100k- 42k = 58K take home per year <br>  <br>  Now you fire the employee.<br>  <br>  The employee makes you 0.0<br>  <br>  0*.42=0 making your tax savings 42,000 dollars<br>  <br>  0-0 =0 Which is your take home after firing employee. <br>  <br>  You can cut your taxes by firing people but you cut your income more. 58k in this case.<br>  <br>  Please show me your calculations because we have an income tax that is always a portion of your income that is less than 100%. <br>  <br>  You should hire every employee that makes you money at any tax rate.|`|AA10123414	First, I am happy to see that your personal income is over $250,000 a year.<br>  <br>  Second "my accountant tells me I have to earn lots more to pay the additional taxes I will owe under Obama." - BS. Since the details are unknown, no accountant would make a statement such as that.|`|JUyid5Wgaa	It doesn't help the economy. That's what we get for having such a weak and inexperienced president.|`|6sjphNcPaa	That's the problem that increasing taxes causes. The twits in Congress can't seem to get it through their thick skulls that cutting taxes increases money into the economy so that businesses can expand.<br>  <br>  It really pisses me off when people, especially minimum wage level, talk about the evil businesses. Sure, some or greedy but businesses are SUPPOSE to make money. We are not in business out of the goodness of our hearts. We don't hire people out of the goodness of our hearts.<br>  <br>  Personally, my husband & I are the only employees. With payroll taxes & other liabilities, we don't have employees. And with the @ssholes in Sacramento, it will be even harder. We pay $800/year just for the "privilege of doing business" in the state of CA!

Like many other things that may have to be changed due to the times. So nothing is set in stone yet, and in fact its due to be announced next week last I heard.<br>  At $1360 a month for two healthy people, I don't want to hear about choosing flat screens over insurance either, that's garbage, I'd have to buy a flat screen each month for that to be accurate.  If the insurance company forces me out by keeping its rates so high why should I feel for them?<br>  <br>  Illegal immigrants have no influence at all on the insurance industry, they don't buy insurance and so they aren't in the loop to start with, not only that but the insurance companies make their own deals with hospitals, and its pretty much take it or leave it. The costs of the uninsured get passed along to people like me, who have some assets and don't have insurance.<br>  <br>  If you think that malpractice make it high think again, because if our costs are due to lousy doctors making mistakes isn't it time we trained better doctors?  Or hired more nurses so only there wouldn't be only one RN at a time  responsible for entire floors at night?

Our Troops must not have died in vain. I myself was in the Navy. If i had to do it again i would. My grandchildren will soon be graduating High School starting this June, with more in the lower grades still to come. My daughter was in during the Gulf War, as my two sons. One of my grandsons just received induction into Highest Honors Society in High School and graduates next year. He has been offered the best military school because he became the youngest Eagle Scout, and has merit badges in just about everything you can think. Who knows he could just one day be President and have that burden of sending Troops to war. I believe we have to do things we hate. Im sure if Christ had had His rathers. He would have rather passed that cup from His hands. But because of His love He chose to save us. Everyone that has given His or Her life done so out of love, not because they chose war. The answer lies in when Christ comes back. Then peace will abide for all time. How could anyone believe any differently when they have lost loved ones!  With dis-belief we would have no hope or future. Good Luck!

The inaccurate attrition rate you've noted (as a university administrator) comes straight from the mouth of the president of the United States.  As shared with the American people during his first address to a joint session of congress on 2/24/2009:<br>   <br>  "The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America.   <br>  <br>  In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity – it is a pre-requisite.    <br>  <br>  Right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma.  And yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education.  We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation.  And half of the students who begin college never finish."<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Barack-Obama-Address-to-Joint-Session-of-Congress/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_offi...</a>

Cn1tSHLpaa	Unfortunately, tax cuts appear to be their only solution to every problem; hence, the reason why we're where we are...they simply can't come up with anything else.  They would rather press for the same BS than actually create a solution.  Many of them say you shouldn't "throw money at the problem" as that won't solve anything but when you look at their argument, they seem to forget that the opposite can also be used to debate their stance as you certainly shouldn't be taking money away from the problem.|`|98EXXItdaa	No, what you don't get is that tax cuts benefit people in proportion to the amount of taxes that they pay.  Move beyond your mindless acceptance of the socialist propaganda and look at who pays taxes in this country.  The rich pay the majority of tax in this country, the math isn't really that hard.. <br>  <br>  Rich guy A, pays $100,000 in tax.  He gets a 5% cut.. how much does he save?<br>  Middle Class guy B, pays $5,000 in tax, he gets a 5% cut.. how much does he save?<br>  Poor guy C, pays no tax.  There's nothing to cut.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Yes.<br>  In addition to tax cuts across the board for individuals and corporations, all illegals should be put into hard labor to build the border fence long and high and after the fence is completed they should be booted to the Mexican side of it.  In addition, people on welfare who can work should lose their benefits.  And, people who have kids they do not support should be sterilized.  <br>  <br>  That's a darned good start.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	Fire 1/3rd of all government workers.  <br>  <br>  Allow any business that cannot run themselves to collapse, if they are bad bankers or bad auto makers, why are we giving them money to continue being bad at what they do ??<br>  <br>  Get rid of the IRS and make everyone pay 10% tax on everything they earn, no cuts for anything.<br>  <br>  Anyone who owns a foreign auto should pay 1000 dollar tax per year/ per car.|`|oYaGeDewaa	so what is your solution. to keep throwing money at the problem|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Deregulating the economy?

What we should do : Not spend trillions we don't have. Criminal prosecution for bank executives. Let people who took loans they couldn't afford lose their homes. Support our auto industry like other countries. Deport all illegal aliens. Put anyone on welfare to work for the federal and/or local government. Eliminate , reduce or restructure entitlement programs. Make the federal government 100% transparent. End all "contributions"by lobbyists. Stop supporting state terrorism by Israel. Make teachers 100% accountable for their performance as teachers.Complete election reform, and have a true multi-party system. End the use of contractors by the military, replace them with US employees.|`|AA11424005	Cut spending.

These last 3 would give a boost to business and have in the past been proven to have a stimulating effect.<br>  <br>  But the thing you need to understand is that government spending like the "stimulus" bill doesn't actually create private sector jobs. And by spending such huge amounts will require credit, which crowds out the credit the private sector can channel, meaning a curtailment in economic growth.<br>  <br>  That's why the Congressional Budget Office (and many other economics experts and professors) concluded that the Democratic bill would have a net negative effect on the economy.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't matter. Neither Obama or Pelosi or Reid will work with the Republicans. The Democrats own the economic policy now. I'm sure Wall Street is responding favorably, no?

That's the point of a deposit. You're paying to book services with someone. It seems like twice you've postponed/changed wedding plans and made your wedding planner reserve 2 different dates for you.

If they tell a lie and you can refute it, make a note and bring it up when they have finished.<br>  <br>  If you properly served them and they don't show, you can ask the judge to find against them by default.

n2oEhdZiaa	He will likely go anywhere where there are heavy mechanized forces stationed now.  1st Armored Div, 1st Cav, 1st Infantry, 3rd Inf, 4th Inf, all have a lot of tanks.  I heard they were using 19k to man the strykers with cannons on them, so that opens up 2nd ID too.  You can google where all those are based, but a few bases in texas, Fort Riley, KS, Ft. Stewart and Ft Benning, GA, and Ft Lewis, WA come to mind immediately.|`|HCFPHlF4aa	Fort Knox, KY<br>  Fort Hood, TX<br>  Fort Irwin, CA (Training)<br>  Aburdeen Proving Grounds<br>  Yuma Proving Grounds|`|4118f39adf9adacb3d20dae6cbc502e6aa	My husband was 19 kilo, we went to Fort Benning in GA.

y2SX4gMfaa	I can actually answer this cuz my kids are in Illinois and I requested a decrease.  Go to the websites I have in my source.  It's a work sheet for calculating the child support he should have to pay.  Theres also information on this website about changing economic circumstances for you to request it to be lowered.  Have copies of his paystubs to send with it.  Last option after all of that is done would be to contact your congressmen and ask for their help.  Good luck.|`|C4lwDCkLaa	My father pays $515 weekly for my sister and I, however it is based on his salary, but I can honestly tell you that what he is paying for his child is not that unreasonable based on what you said he was making.

Wow   Go talk to an attorney and go back to court to get the amount amended.|`|AA10123414	If his income has changed due to no fault of his own he can apply for a modification of child support with the court. The support amount would be set by the support guidelines.|`|uCi1LPAzaa	I don't know how it works in IL, but in WV all child support payments and issues are dealt with by the Bureau for Child Support Enforcement (BCSE).  Anytime there has been a change in income for either party, you can go directly to the BCSE and fill out a form to request a change in the order.  This is nice because it keeps one from having to wait to go back to court.  If you're state has something like this as well, I would start there.|`|jhNUuz0maa	The case would have to be taken back to court. The judge would then consider lowering the amount. However, then you are cheating the child.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Only by going back to court and asking for a reduction. The child support was court ordered, and only a court can change it.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Support SHOULD  be adjusted for income, his, talk to your attorney
pompD5voaa	Your insurance will be notified, but it won't go up.|`|Yh63ysrzaa	I would look into this more, because my understanding is that your insurance is never "notified" by the police of a traffic violation.  They find these things out by checking the police logs.<br>  <br>  However, I'm not sure how often they check these logs.  If it isn't something like an accident, I'm not sure you have to worry.  And if you aren't getting any points it was a fairly insignificant violation.<br>  <br>  I just can't see them checking all the police logs all over the state every day for every person...<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Be careful!|`|B4O3f8w6aa	No points since it is a Non-moving violation. Insurance will not do anything if notified.

When did this start happening?|`|SWkaGJpgaa	You might just find out that all the Democrat bills won't do a thing for those either, and they won't improve the economy.

It's not the Government's job to "help" people. It's to keep us safe and stay out of our way. People and their families have to start helping each other instead of everyone expecting the government to do it. We've become a selfish society. And neither the Dems nor the Republicans are responsible for Americans' screwups, innocent as they may have been (and I assume most of them WERE innocent.

As for an article 15 the room would have to be damaged badly or you would have to be a repeat offender. The way the system should work is start at a counseling session and then move up to an article 15. That's where the repeat offender comes in.

4eIXUy4paa	I would go with light.  The advantage to heavy is you probably wouldn't have to march as often.  I'm in the U.S. Army and the stereotype that our tankers have is that they are fat and out of shape.  In light, you probably wouldn't have to spend as much time on your vehicle as you would if you had a tracked vehicle.  Plus, if you ran into a problem that had to be fixed immediately, the tracked vehicle would be much more difficult I would think.  I don't have any experience with tracked vehicles, but I've been told by more than one senior infantrymen that they are a pain in the ***, and that light infantry is the way to go.|`|HCFPHlF4aa	Light, its good to be able to move without the constraints of a heavy tanker.
OQmSh8Uaaa	They get to choose Air, Law or Ground when they go in.  Air contract must pass a flight physical. Law contracts must have completed their JD or be accepted into a program.  If they pick ground they, depending on gender, can end up in anyother MOS.  <br>  <br>  After OCS all officers must complete infantry type training at The Basic School also in Quantico.  When I was with E&I Co, I think it combat instructor company now, we would run them through familarization on some crew served weapons and act as aggressors when they were doing there field training.  there's some more to it than that, but that's the idea of it.  If it's still the same as when I was there the Lts will qual on the rifle and pistol range while they are at TBS.<br>  <br>  While at TBS the classes our broken down into 3rds based on grades and the top of those 3rds are more likely to get the MOS they want.  They do this to ensure that no one MOS gets all the good officers while MOSs, like supply, get a bunch of dumbasses.  If a male officer gets infantry they stay in Quantico and complete IOC for their MOS training.  I have no idea about where other MOSs go.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	USMC Officers state a preference for an MOS during TBS(The Basic School) which  all Marine Officers attend and which follows OCS or graduation for those who commissioned through NROTC, PLC and the Naval Academy.

Dwight Eisenhower?  Neil Armstrong?  Johnny Cash?

Again, you should have a lawyer.|`|967aae0d16dea5cecb00409736b6dcb0aa	The lawyer can file paperwork stating that you cannot remove the child from the state. My ex did it to me years ago, and once that is done, you can move around the state, but not out of it. <br>  <br>  You need to know if the paperwork has been filed yet and if it isn't, then contact your attorney and see if you can move before it is filed and be safe. In the sate I live in, if you move before the injunction is filed, then they cannot make you come back, as long as you stick to the stipulations in the original paperwork.

au0ssSnvaa	Ok, if you are in the DEP program and have Not taken your Second Oath of Enlistment , signed your contract and shipped to Boot Camp (usually all done on the day you ship out to boot camp) , then you can back out of DEP. You will be within your rights. You will need to draft a letter to the Recruiting Command stating you wish to be released from DEP and no longer wish to join.<br>  <br>  The recruiter may be angry and try to talk you out of backing out but there is nothing they can truly do. So if you get any threats then they aren't telling the truth. However, if you change your mind and decide later on to join again, the branch you enlisted in may be hesitant to work with you. <br>  <br>  No they don't own you either and don't listen to those on here who say they do. You will not get a Honorable , OTH or any other discharge because you aren't truly in yet. Just a generalized release from DEP.<br>  <br>  If your not happy with your contract, see what one of the other branches will offer you.|`|WO68RZdIaa	You are not officially in until the end of April when you will report to MEPS for the last time to get sworn in, sign a final contract & then scheduled to ship out later that day for Basic Training. <br>  <br>  At any point prior to that day, you can legally back out without any risk of being punished under the UCMJ. Expect your recruiter to try to talk you out of bailing since they have invested a lot of time in getting you signed up.<br>  <br>  It will be harder to get back into that branch afterwards if you back out now, in fact it will be harder to get into any of the branches if you change you mind & want to go back into the military at a later time.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Talk with the senior recruiter where you joined about what you believe to be a contract violation.  I can't believe you can't get out of it.  For a contract to be enforceable, there has to be offer, acceptance and consideration.  The first two are there, in your signature on the contract.  But unless you ahve already received something of tangible value, there is no consideration.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	If you are in the DEP, you can get out of your contract.

If you choose not to go the consequences are that you won't get another chance to this branch and it will be much more difficult to join any other branch.  You may not like your contract but it's better to stick it out and just go to basic.  You may end up liking your job and if you don't you can always cross train later.  Plus, the military is better than trying to stick it out in this economy.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	How did you get screwed on a contract that you got to review before you signed?  No one pointed a gun to your head.  If you didn't stand up for what you want, then you desperately need the military to help you find your balls so you don't get pressured into stuff in the future.  Stop blaming other people for your mistakes and take some responsibility for your commitments.|`|cCBwK2EGaa	depends in the Marine corps the dep really doesn't count for **** but the army should already be paying you so you might be screwed.<br>  <br>  -also ray is a good answer person thing but yes you can get screwed due to peer pressure that is a *****.

My original paternity and child custody case was in Appleton (Outagamie County).  I currently live in Milwaukee County and my daughter's father lives out of state.  Outagamie Child Support still administers my case.  When my ex actually pays his child support, it goes to the Support System, which is state-wide.  The system then generates a check and deposits the amount directly into my bank account.

K8qAniReaa	A person of any profession can join the national guard. The guard will train everyone for the job they will perform.<br>  <br>  The only time an outside job matters is if the recruit wants to become a warrant officer.  Warrant officers are highly specialized soldiers/airmen who only work in that one technical field.  For instance a aviation warrant officer only flies helicopters.  They know the one thing and that's all they do.  <br>  <br>  There is no specific MOS for a university professor.  But that professor can join the guard as an enlisted soldier or an officer and they will be trained in a specif MOS or branch.|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	It's not unheard of, but as someone else said, a lot of college professor types (from my personal college experiences) tend to be more on the liberal side, whereas military personnel tend to be more conservative.<br>  <br>  I'm not stating this as golden fact. I don't have any factual/statistical basis for this. Just my personal feeling on the issue.|`|PPKuHl9baa	In my experience the last thing a professor would do is join a branch of the military since it typically conflicts with their ideals.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Yes, some do.

If we are going to use the guns protect people argument, we should have everybody on reaching adulthood train for a summer or so, and induct them into the National Guard reserve, and give them a weapon and (a limited amount of) ammunition.  That is what Switzerland does, more or less.  But, that isn't what people want.  They want toys.  Guns are really dangerous.  You know you can use them to kill people.  Poor people like killing people.  Poor people happen to like guns.  So, if you really think people need protection that doesn't come from the police or the National Guard, fine.  But, guns are no good for protection without proper training and organization (organization only for external threats and those threats from the government, you don't need organization to "protect"  your home).|`|b32jC7pGaa	No problem.

He stated that his targets were high level US Army, Navy and Air Force computers and that his ultimate goal was to gain access to the US military classified information network. He admitted leaving a note on one army computer reading:<br>  <br>  “US foreign policy is akin to government-sponsored terrorism these days . . .

As someone that has created more straw men than Carter has pills, he has NO room to talk.  As usual, he states only what suits him, and, as usual, omits what doesn't. <br>  <br>  Being a Texan, I have been dealing with Mr. Roves dirty tricks, low-life BS and straw men longer than most.  I find the "man" (and I use the word loosely here) detestable.<br>  <br>  Like his comparisons on Bushes tax breaks - what he says is true, but he conveniently omits the part about not taxing so much of the rich's income that just isn't what others can afford, like capital gains, offshore accounts etc...<br>  He also fails to mention the The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which was brought in by Republicans. <br>  Bush "made" more millionaires through skewed monetary policies than has ever been made.  They aren't "hard working" people that deserve their wealth, they are opportunists like Custer-Battles.<br>  <br>  However, he does make some points here.<br>  <br>  I also wonder if Obama realizes that while Lincoln truly deplored slavery, he ALSO didn't think that Blacks should be left in America - that they should have been shipped back to Africa.  I find it very strange that he apparently doesn't seem aware of this fact, and continually praises the man.<br>  <br>  I am truly unhappy with ALL of these "stimulus" deals, both Bushes AND Obamas, OUR government HAS NO BUSINESS doing what it's doing.

All the time I hear people saying that they sell drugs and do bad things, but so do many American citizens. I think if you are willing to work hard, and pay taxes, and know english you should beable to live here.<br>  <br>  If you think about, really the only difference between us who were born in the US, and the illegal immigrants is where we were born. They are still people, and the only reason why they enter this country illegally is because they feel that it is the only way.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Probably war but there's war now too and misery and death. Once the foreign troops leave I believe Iraq will stabilize sooner.<br>  American troops in Iraq are defending corporate interests, not helping the Iraqi people. If the US wants to pay damages that's what they should do with cold hard dollars, not continue a military occupation on behalf of the corporate elite under the pretext of helping.<br>  <br>  While Washington and much of the media routinely crow about a supposed “return to normalcy” in Iraq, the conditions facing the country’s 28 million people remain appalling.<br>  The human toll from nearly six years of US occupation is estimated, according to the most credible surveys, at over one million dead. According to the International Office on Migration, 2.8 million Iraqis are internally displaced persons, forced from their homes by the violence, and another 2.4 million are refugees who fled the country.<br>  Having decimated Iraq’s infrastructure with the “shock and awe” bombardment of March 2003 and more than a decade of punishing economic sanctions that preceded it, Washington has done next to nothing to rebuild the country outside of efforts to reconstitute its security forces as a puppet army of repression. Instead, the so-called reconstruction effort has consisted of a massive looting operation by corporations awarded cost-plus contracts for work that in many cases was never done and in others done so badly as to be worthless.<br>  The result of this corruption and negligence is a continuing social catastrophe for the Iraqi people. According to a recent Oxfam report, the share of Iraqis without access to adequate water supplies rose from 50 percent to 70 percent from the start of the war to 2007.<br>  According to the inspector general’s report, two-thirds of Baghdad’s sewage flows untreated into the city’s rivers and waterways, finding its way into the drinking water. The result is repeated deadly outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.<br>  At least two-thirds of Iraqis are still plagued by inadequate power supplies as a result of the war’s destruction, with frequent and prolonged blackouts making normal economic and domestic life impossible.<br>  The population remains mired in mass unemployment. According to official figures, 18 percent of Iraqis are jobless, with another 10 percent unable to find full-time employment.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb2009/pers-f18.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...</a><br>  Most Iraqis want the Americans gone for years now, their wishes should finally be respected.<br>  <br>  A strong majority of Iraqis want U.S.-led military forces to immediately withdraw from the country, saying their swift departure would make Iraq more secure and decrease sectarian violence<br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/26/AR2006092601721.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=11314&Itemid=128" rel="nofollow">http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option...</a>|`|gJzEAvNTaa	by "we leaving" i think you mean our military<br>  but, EXXON Mobil, Chevron, BP, Halliburton, all these private companies would still be operating in Iraq without military support for security purposes. so most likely, the Iraqis will descend into civil war, (no iraqi likes seeing a Kurd as their president) and struggle for power between sunni and shia. then terrorists would probably kidnapp and behead those American civilians working in halliburton and KBR, etc so on, and we'd have a hostage crisis and go right back in<br>  <br>  PS: we can't leave<br>  14 new military bases are being built in Iraq<br>  we're not leaving<br>  we never will leave<br>  there will always be a us military presence there<br>  its for securing Iraq's oil<br>  just so you know, the war started b/c iraq (the world's 2nd largest oil exporter) was the only nation which refused to sell oil to us, and the saddam regime had to be overthrow and replaced w/ one cooperative to american interests|`|dHjya1Yoaa	A vacuum would be created and violence would escalate even farther than it already has...

Today I am looking back on 6 years of occupation.  I look at our country spending billions each month to help police theirs.  And I'm wondering why?  Saddam's army was destroyed, his regime was toppled, he was captured-tried-convicted-and executive, free elections have been held, they have a democratic constitution, and thanks to the surge over a year ago the country is more stable than ever.

(a) No person under the age of 21 years shall knowingly<br>  drive any motor vehicle carrying any alcoholic beverage, unless the<br>  person is accompanied by a parent, responsible adult relative, any<br>  other adult designated by the parent, or legal guardian for the<br>  purpose of transportation of an alcoholic beverage, or is employed by<br>  a licensee under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (Division 9<br>  (commencing with Section 23000) of the Business and Professions<br>  Code), and is driving the motor vehicle during regular hours and in<br>  the course of the person's employment. If the driver was<br>  unaccompanied, he or she shall have a complete defense if he or she<br>  was following, in a timely manner, the reasonable instructions of his<br>  or her parent, legal guardian, responsible adult relative, or adult<br>  designee relating to disposition of the alcoholic beverage.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	If the alcohol is found by officers during a legal search, the charge is possession of alcohol by a minor unless you meet certain exclusions to the law, these exclusions vary by state.  <br>  <br>  If you are the driver or owner of a car you are considered to be "in possession" of anything in the car.<br>  <br>  NY would suspend your license for a year or so and fine you big time, not a good thing to do in NY.

The Right to Bare Arms was afforded the people of the United States as a means to protect themselves from enemies foreign AND domestic. This was meant to include a power hungry government who may try to impose themselves on Americans more than they should.<br>  <br>  If gun ownership is made illegal to the average, law abiding citizens of the US, it will only increase gun related crime.

AA10187742	All will be coming soon at the rate Obama is going.........sad, sad, sad|`|AA11875616	Because food is still a free-market activity here.  Automobiles are not a free-market good, and neither is housing, transportation, or medical care.  Government regulation controls what the supply looks like from the consumer's point of view.<br>  <br>  In almost all communities, if you bought a piece of land, and built a plywood shack on it to live in, you would be in jail in a heartbeat.  Also, if you built your own car out of spare parts of lawnmowers and bicycles, you would also be in jail.  You could count roads and highways as transportation, which are a public good and supported and repaired with taxes from those who would either use or benefit from them.  Public transportation is a public good and also a benefit as those who don't drive, or can't afford to drive, have access to a wider world out there.<br>  <br>  I detect that you believe that their is something wrong with access to medical care.  Insurance is the gate-keeper of access to medical care.  Some states allow the uninsured access to life-saving treatments, and some do but make them pay, or have a very low qualification income ceiling.<br>  <br>  Just think, if we had food insurance, no one would be able to buy meat.  It would cost hundreds of dollars a pound, as most dietitians and nutritionists believe that meat is very bad for you.  Also, you would not be able to buy alcohol, tobacco, and lard.  I'm sure that your imagination can come up with foods we all have access to, at paltry prices, that are considered very,very bad, like ice cream.<br>  <br>  If there was no health insurance, doctors and other highly-paid medical professionals would be driving around in Hyundais, not BMWs or Hummers.  They would have to live in neighborhoods like mine, and shop at Wal-mart or K-Mart.<br>  <br>  Health care is no more a free-market activity than all the other activities you name.  Personally, I want my doctor to care more about my health than about his next car payment or his junket off to some exotic realm.  Most doctors go into medicine to get rich, not to help people or ease suffering.  There are still a few who do care, but since those who don't care are now the majority, the relationship between doctor and patient has ceased to be a free-market activity.

ZzXxRLWcaa	Thats actually a very good argument man, I cant find much fault with it other then self-interest.<br>  <br>  I think its kinda that way now though... and wont change. I mean no one reasonably expects top flight stuff when their begging for a handout.<br>  <br>  But I think you miss the slightly larger point which is that we DONT have an effective system where anyone can get care, even very basic care if they need it.<br>  <br>  Basically we have a system where someone is sick and has no insurance, lets call him "Bob". Bob gets very sick and then goes to the emergency room. Nurse Betty and Doctor Phil now have to care for bob because of the Hippocratic oath they took. The hospital gets no money for their trouble and that cost now gets spread out to people like you and me and compromises the quality of our care.<br>  <br>  However if Bob had some sort of government insurance before hand he'd have access to preventative care (for one) which greatly reduces a persons odds of a serious hospital visit. Also if he did show up in an ER, the hospital now has a place from which to recoup the money...instead of passing it on to other people.<br>  <br>  Thats why we need some form of universal coverage. We pay either way man, all us tax payers and especially those of us who do things the "right way". So we might as well streamline the system and get it above board.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Whoever's thumbs downing me has obviously no concept of how our health care system works.

AA12341057	There is no entity that controls bubbles and busts- otherwise they wouldn't happen. But it's a trickier thing to create than you might imagine, because having a government entity establishing the value of everything would absolutely defeat the purpose of a free market. <br>  <br>  Investors buy into bubbles, sometimes knowingly, because there is real money to be made before they burst. As long as you're in and out before that happens, then you've made good money for your clients. A conscientous broker who decided not to participate, would simply be ignoring a viable source of income for his clients. <br>  <br>  It is a flaw in our current economic system, that gets exploited far too often, but unfortunately there isn't a simple solution to it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Nope, not the Fed, nor the consumer markets. Seriously, nobody controls them. That's why the housing market caught people by surprise (knowing it's a bubble doesn't tell you *when* it will burst); and also why a barrel of oil that costed about $65 two years ago, costed $150 last July, and costs around $35 today.|`|AA11163314	The banks had no better prior knowelage than the homeowners.  In fact everybody (even the home buyers) knew that housing prices were way above their true values.<br>  <br>  Some of the people who took the ARMs knowingly and willingly accepted the risk inherrent in that type of mortgagte.  They bet that the bubble would continue long enough for them to re-finance at a lower rate.<br>  <br>  They lost the bet.<br>  <br>  The rest of the people who took out the ARMs never even bothered to evaluate the risk and most of them never even bothered to learn the full details of the contract before they signed it.|`|AA11942937	because of the term 'housing bubble'<br>  <br>  Everyone knew housing was at inflated prices..prices which would fall when the bubble burst.  If they were paying too much.it should have set off warning bells.<br>  <br>  The banks didn't MAKE them take a loan to buy a house way too expensive for their means.  They did that through their own selfish desires to have something bigger and better than their salary afforded.  They used the available loans to get them the most house at the moment.<br>  <br>  It all boils down to personal responsibility.  The owner has to make the decision what they can afford.  The owner has to choose to buy within their means.  Some of us did.........so we should pay for those who wanted more than they could afford?  I think it's a reasonable question for responsible home owners to ask.  Some of them are living in 1500 sq ft houses while foreclosures are on house much larger.  Where's the common sense to that?|`|AA11305474	Certainly out here in CA, financial institutions, real estate sales people, underwriters and yes, those who took out the mortgages all believed the myth that California real estate only increases, never decreases.  But, none of them were forward looking enough and those taking out the mortgages never really thought the mortgage rates would re-set and their payments would increase.  What made it worse out here was that for those who did have equity, they were giving out lines of credit like candy for everything from "home improvement" to debt reduction to purchases of automobiles.  They never counted on the value of the real estate going down either and now that it has they are calling in those lines, closing or reducing them.  Some people are in the position of paying 10s of thousands of dollars within 30-60 days because the property value dropped since the time they took out their equity line.  There is certainly enough blame to go around, but part of the problem in CA is that ninja (no job, no asset, no income) loans were made to illegal aliens who have since left the country.  Several people were convicted and jailed since the beginning of the year for marketing loan vehicles to illegal aliens who they knew couldn't afford the mortgages they were taking out and worse yet, they were hispanic preying on hispanics.  Did they have confidence in the market or were they just being greedy trying to increase their commissions?|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	The may have been showing their confidence in the market, but they weren't being very responsible, nor were they asking enough questions before signing their mortgages.  If they had been responsible enough to say, pay a lawyer a few hundred dollars to look over the contract for them, or had realistic expectations on their ability to pay off the loan, perhaps they could have avoided a lot of trouble.  The glut of people buying homes with or without an ARM is what drove up the cost of housing to an artificial high, because there were more people wanting to buy houses than there were houses to sell, in my opinion.  When people started to default on those loans, and had their homes foreclosed, more houses became available, and the price went down again, along with the value of other homes.

n2oEhdZiaa	You will very likely be able to negotiate for a new MOS at the conclusion of your four years of active service if you decide to extend your active contract.|`|4eIXUy4paa	It shouldn't be hard at all.  Unless the MOS you are in now is a "star" MOS.  Even if it is, you should see your retention NCO.  Re-enlist for another MOS.  A lot of soldiers do that.  You are eligible once you are within 2 years of the end of your first contract.  The great thing is, if you re-enlisted 2 years in, your second contract starts when you re-enlist, so you don't have to finish the entire 4 years of the first.  For example, if you re-enlist for 4 years, and your 2 years into your 4 year contract, your second contract ends when you've been in for 6 years, not 8.  You will have to do the inactive reserve time until you pass the 8 year mark though.  After 6 years active, that will cut your inactive reserve time to 2 years instead of 4 though.
owzmt7lDaa	The age of consent is the age in which one can engage in sexual activity legally with another.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	The first three questions are no.  Legal age of consent does not cover those areas in most states.  The old law still applies.  The statute for consensual sex and independent habitation is still 18.  The 20 year old could be arrested for acting against a statutory law.  The seventeen year can be prevented from moving.  If consent is given from caretakers of the 17 to do either, charges can be pressed against them.
fwpw3kvlaa	It an attempt to answer your weirdly worded question, not selling alcohol on Sundays is ridiculous, especially if it is still being served at restaurants.

ZmdIlkpQaa	Assuming no release of nuclear weapons, and assuming the war were fought in Europe or European Russia, it's likely the US would win, and win quickly.  <br>  <br>  1.  US airpower is essentially unmatched.  With stealth bombers and the F-117 and the powerful, interlinked conventional aircraft, and with the newer generation of standoff weapons, the US would be able to achieve air superiority early, and attack ground targets with relative impunity.<br>  <br>  2.  The M-1 Abrams is essentially the best land weapon system in the world.  Recent ammo upgrades and interlink upgrades allow units to cooperate much more fluidly, and to hit much harder, and even against numerically superior Soviet-era tanks, no M-1 has ever been lost to tank fire.  Moreover, the crews are superbly trained and have a wealth of real world combat experience.<br>  <br>  3.  The vast difference in the levels of experience between the Russian military and the US.  US pilots have more combat stick time than any other airforce in the world, while the Russian air force barely has enough fuel to allow their pilots even minimal training flight time.  US armor and infantry forces are highly veteran and highly trained while their Russian counterparts tend to be conscript and to have very little real combat experience, and are also hampered by the lack of fuel stocks for realistic training.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	War is essentially obsolete.  The risks of nuclear armed conflict are zero sum resolution.  There are no winners.  Mutual annihilation leaves no winner.

That would guarantee a win for Obama.<br>  <br>  You've GOT to be kidding.  Jindal won't have a chance for a million reasons and then some.  Palin would be a better candidate and she has already proven herself as a joke.<br>  <br>  You Republicans sure are stupid.|`|5q8b0C2kaa	Jindal. He's the friendly neighbor type that Americans love. And he doesn't care about minorities and the unemployed so he's got my vote.|`|SpBAcRJmaa	As a democrat I only pray that is the ticket, it has two upsides, Obama is gaurenteed a second term, and SNL will have great shows in 2012!!|`|t9a2qYv4aa	haaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...<br>  <br>  <br>  o....o......o.......ahahahhahahahahaha...|`|5e5c5c1cfde2ffcdb16e4ce17d31b558aa	I think a Palin/Jindal ticket would be fantastic for 2012.

mbvpWNMeaa	It is hard to say whether there were serial killers in centuries past because there were generally no consistent records kept of crime statistics or court proceedings in most times and places in history. Going by anthropological evidence, it would be hard to distinguish between the victims of a serial killer and those of a ritual sacrifice, war,  war crimes, or individual murderers.|`|yOw9g9ncaa	Historical criminologists have suggested that there may have been serial murders throughout history, but specific cases were not adequately recorded. Some sources suggest that legends such as werewolves and vampires were inspired by medieval serial killers.[48]<br>  <br>  Liu Pengli of China, cousin of the Han Emperor Jing, was made king of Jidong in the sixth year of the middle period of Jing's reign (144 BC). According to the Chinese historian Sima Qian, he would "go out on marauding expeditions with 20 or 30 slaves or young men who were in hiding from the law, murdering people and seizing their belongings for sheer sport". Although many of his subjects knew about these murders, it was not until the 29th year of his reign that the son of one of his victims finally sent a report to the Emperor. Eventually, it was discovered that he had murdered at least 100 people. The officials of the court requested that Liu Pengli be executed; however, the emperor could not bear to have his own cousin killed, and Liu Pengli was made a commoner and banished.[49]<br>  <br>  In the 15th century, one of the wealthiest men in France, Gilles de Rais, is said to have abducted, sexually assaulted and killed at least 100 children, mainly boys, whom he had abducted from the surrounding villages and taken to his castle. The Hungarian aristocrat Elizabeth Báthory was arrested in 1610 and subsequently charged with torturing and butchering as many as 600 young girls. Like Liu Pengli, they were not immediately brought to justice because[citation needed] they were rich, powerful and, most importantly, royalty. Although their crimes were known or suspected, official refused to believe any allegations until they could no longer be denied.[citation needed] After his arrest, de Rais confessed to his crimes, which also included delusions of demon worship.[citations needed]<br>  <br>  Chronicles of the times dealt largely with the affairs of the powerful; moreover, there was a lack of established police forces, at least in Europe, during those centuries. Therefore, there may have been many other classical or medieval serial killers who were either not identified or not publicized as well. Many incidents that were probably the work of serial killers were blamed on werewolves and demonic spirits.[citations needed]<br>  <br>  Thug Behram, a gang leader of the Indian Thuggee cult of assassins, has frequently been said to be the world's most prolific serial killer. According to numerous sources, he was believed to have murdered 931 victims by means of strangulation with a ceremonial cloth (or rumal, which in Hindi means handkerchief), used by his cult between 1790 and 1830, thus holding the record for the most murders directly committed by a single person in history.[50]<br>  <br>  In total, the Thugs as a whole were responsible for approximately 2 million deaths, according to Guinness World Records. The notoriety of the Thugs eventually led to the word thug entering the English language as a term for ruffians, miscreants, and people who behave in an aggressive manner towards others. Recent scholarship has cast doubt on the Thuggee cult and suggested that the British in India were confused by the vernacular use of the term by Indians, and may also have used fear of such a cult to justify their colonial rule.[50]<br>  <br>  In his 1886 book Psychopathia Sexualis, psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing noted a case of a serial murderer in the 1870s, a Frenchman named Eusebius Pieydagnelle who had a sexual obsession with blood, and who confessed to murdering six people.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The unidentified killer Jack the Ripper killed prostitutes (the exact number of victims is not known) in London in 1888. Those crimes gained enormous press attention because London was the world's greatest centre of power at the time, so having such dramatic murders of financially destitute women in the midst of such wealth focused the news media's attention on the plight of the urban poor and gained coverage worldwide. He has also been called the most famous serial killer of all time.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  American serial killer H. H. Holmes was hanged in Philadelphia in 1896 after confessing to 27 murders. Joseph Vacher was executed in France in 1898 after confessing to killing and mutilating 11 women and children.|`|uqtbil0Haa	check it out <a href="http://mysterytopia.com/2008/08/first-serial-killer-who-was-he.html" rel="nofollow">http://mysterytopia.com/2008/08/first-se...</a>|`|hMF3kg3Baa	YES!|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	They have been around since the dawn of man.

The end result of taking freedoms from people through Socialism and Communism is Gestapo type activity.  It happened in Germany, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, etc.  When Canada, Italy and even France realize after decades that Socialism doesn't work and elect Republican style conservative leaders you would think America would have been smart enough to get the clue.  Sadly they just made the same mistake Germany made with Hitler, they elected a guy that they feel can speak well and they like what he says.

AvAkwdGKaa	The coffins are on military aircraft, coming onto military bases.  Once they left there and went to the families they could take all the pictures they wanted.|`|AA12281247	The authority exists to ban the media from any military operations.<br>  Considering the media is its own government and agenda, this will happen more and more, to assure the security of operations.<br>  Running to take pictures of coffins is not news, it is a political agenda. Every newspaper routinely gives names of servicemen and women killed,  a picture of rows of coffins has no news value.|`|Yfjh3kBAaa	This is where I draw the fine line between freedom of press and speech, and morals. <br>  <br>  Yes, it definitely could be a measure of national security as stated above.  But what I'm getting at is, put yourself in the shoes of some parents or spouses who just recently got a call that their loved one will not be coming home alive?  I know some of these parents, and trust me the last thing they want to see is the news channel showing a picture of some American flag draped coffins coming home to be buried, and wondering which one might contain their son, daughter, husband or wife.  I'm sure that it would be heartbreaking and would absolutely rip yourself apart emotionally.  <br>  <br>  Yes, we have freedoms which were established by our fore-fathers, and goddammit I'll defend them.  But I personally think the media has turned into an out-of-control monster.  They show no morals, no respect and no dignity on anything anymore and I cannot understand how they get on TV and show a straight face while talking about some of these issues.  Let the ones who died to fight for our freedoms and the freedoms of others have some peace.  They deserve our respect, as well as the ones who raised them and loved them.  Showing pictures of coffins containing the corpses of the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice is not showing respect to anyone related to them or themselves.  <br>  <br>  If the media, civilians, whomever wants to show respect to those soldiers, then I would suggest spreading the word for support over showing pictures.  All showing pictures does is demoralize an entire country filled with sick, twisted people.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	The Press is a civilian organization!

Our economy is shaky. People are having trouble keeping jobs and their house.  America is has lost that super power status.  Our government has focused on everyone else (countries) for the last several years that our own needs were put on the back burner. We need to focus on domestic issues and those four are the people to do that.  No they don't have direct military experience, but I don't think that military experience will help get the economy back on track or help people keep jobs, etc.  Our Military isn't the only thing that keep this country strong. I love the military...my husband is a Marine.  In saying, military service does not qualify someone to run the Country.<br>  Franklin D.

AA10925759	Guys who want to be Marines usually have the "rush" attitude.<br>  <br>  It is not about what your wear exactly. You need to draw the enemy into the area of your choosing. You make them feel like you are on the run, totally disorganized and all of that. Then the enemy feels confident (don't make it seem super easy).<br>  <br>  Meanwhile you have people in various positions or know exactly where to go. <br>  <br>  Basically it is making the enemy overconfident so they are drawn into a place where you have a better position. Have a couple of the people on your team drop things on the way there. Canteen, some wrappers, kick up some mud..... make them think they are the smart ones. <br>  <br>  Chip a tree or leave some weird thing hanging like a teddy bear before that.

If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:<br>  <br>  The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing. <br>  <br>  The fifth would pay $1.<br>  <br>  The sixth would pay $3.<br>  <br>  The seventh would pay $7.<br>  <br>  The eighth would pay $12.<br>  <br>  The ninth would pay $18.<br>  <br>  The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.<br>  <br>  So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. 'Since you are all such good customers,' he said, 'I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20. 'Drinks for the ten now cost just $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men - the paying customers? <br>  <br>  How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share?' They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay. <br>  <br>  And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).<br>  <br>  The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33%savings).<br>  <br>  The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).<br>  <br>  The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).<br>  <br>  The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).<br>  <br>  The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).<br>  <br>  Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. <br>  <br>  'I only got a dollar out of the $20,' declared the sixth man. <br>  <br>  He pointed to the tenth man, 'but he got $10!  ''Yeah, that's right,' exclaimed the fifth man. <br>  <br>  'I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than I!  ''That's true!!' shouted the seventh man. <br>  <br>  'Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? <br>  <br>  The wealthy get all the breaks! <br>  <br>  ''Wait a minute,' yelled the first four men in unison. 'We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!<br>  <br>  'The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night the tenth man (the richest) didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!<br>  <br>  And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.<br>  <br>  David R.

bmCInR5qaa	We are the people who control your lives.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	Illuminati (an ancient organization) is basically a word used today to indicate a pholosophy and agenda.  There are many people who are proponents of their ideology.  Most recently, a group of wealthy industrialists including members of the Rockefeller family, set out to establish the groundwork for a one world government.  It was never quite possible before, but in  1913, they established the Federal Reserve, and together with other ultra-rich bankers like the Rothschilds, began manipulating our country, and other nations, to where we are today.<br>  <br>  This is a very short synopsis.  You need to research the history of the Federal Reserve, New World Order, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, Club of Rome, for starters.  Please dig deeper than 1st level Google or Yahoo searches because the very people you are trying to research control the information given about them  - thus all of the 'conspiracy theory' rhetoric.<br>  <br>  Many US presidents have been involved with this movement, including Carter, Clinton, Bush 1 and 2, and now Obama.  They are just puppets who obey orders.  The world is at a point now where their plans for a global government are no longer secretive, but widely accepted by many - including many liberals here in the US.  Other nations are finalizing plans to surrender sovereignty.  The US will be forced to surrender sovereignty when our economy crashes as a result of out-of-control spending.  If you hadn't noticed, our economic crisis is planned - Obama's policies, including those hidden neo-communist restrictions and constitutional rights violations in the stimulus package, are part of his marching orders.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of stories about NWO on international news sources (the US media is still keeping us in the dark).  Research is the best way to find out for yourself.  Check out any links you may get in the answers to this question too.<br>  <br>  NWO is real, and coming soon, and you'll be shocked when you connect the dots about who is involved and what they have planned for the US.  You can see it already - a little pressure and people are willing to overlook anything for relief.  The G-20 conference last November was overshadowed by the election.  Bush signed over the SEC to foreign oversight.  Yesterday, Obama said global oversight would be necessary of banking practices.  Little by little they are taking over everything.  Any terrorist attack or severe economic depression will have people screaming for relief and running to a global government for help.|`|r6ok7NbEaa	Please...PLEASE watch the illuminati documentaries on google video.

C8NkAhYpaa	Obama may say that he will help all those poor and impoverished in other countries but he can't really do much. I think if he cannot fix Americas financial problems then there is very little way for him to help any other countries. <br>  <br>  During the great depression the depression hit America first and spread through the rest of the world like a wave. If the most developed nation in the world is having issues those issues will include everyone. <br>  <br>  As far as the population issue for India only India can fix that. Obama can not say stop having kids and boom they will listen. Only the Indian government can fix that by instituting taxes for having to many children like China did. But i'm not really convinced that is ethical.

H5Jrd0siaa	This is a tough one.<br>  Simple version. Yugoslavia was controlled by Tito the dictator,with a fist! He kept every one in line. <br>  He died. The grip he had controlling all the different parts and elements faded away.<br>  The conponants of Yugoslavia wanted independace starting with Bosnia<br>  Milosivitch, the then head of Yugoslavia resistied this and said he would use force to stop them breaking way. Initally Serbia and Croatia fought against Bosnia and then against each other and soon Croatia fought with Bosnia against serbia. Over the 90's Montenigro and Kosovo have also tried to break away. The book death of yugoslavia is an excellent book which covers this subject. The intervention of the UN did nothing to stop this and the NATO forces have brough peace to a very troubled region.

If the club falls under this definition, yes you can go into the club if you are 18.<br>  <br>  The person(s) working the door will check for ID & most of the better bars & clubs have people who can spot a fake ID & in the 2 college towns near where I live, they do look over the ID's carefully & they will call the police if you present a fake ID. Also officers of the state's Alcohol Beverage Commission will make their rounds to all of the bars & spot check ID's. <br>  <br>  The fines are not cheap- to yo for having the fake ID or the bar owner for serving an underage person alcohol. 2 bars have lost their alcohol license recently for doing just that & numerous clubs where I live have had to be sold or transfer ownership due to the bar owner going to jail for allowing underage patrons in the bar. <br>  <br>  So with the penalties the bar can face, don't expect any reputable bar or club to bend the rules & allow you in. That is their business, how they support their families, etc & no competent business owner will jeopardize everything they have worked for & risk losing their source of income by allowing underage people into their bar or club if it is strictly 21 & over.<br>  <br>  Additional info:<br>   I would like to know why the thumbs down. If you are under 21 you cannot legally get into any bar that serves alcohol if it is strictly a 21 & over bar. NO bar CAN legally sell anyone under 21 alcohol. That is the law, it's not open for interpretation.<br>  <br>  I met a couple of OHP officers that works the area around OU & I'll pass the word on to them that there is a bar that  is illegally allowing underage drinking. Thanks for the info. (And I am not lying, Ohio Highway Patrol will be notified of this serious violation of OH state alcohol laws. There cannot be very many bars that has "family night" & this one may even be well known to the police for past violations, making it even that much easier to locate)|`|3FerQ9Ehaa	Federal drinking age is 21 (NO EXCEPTIONS). Anyone that is not abiding by this is breaking the law. So no, it is not true ANY time.|`|7oiBFIguaa	Age dosnt matter to go into bars, you just cant be in after 10pm if your under 21.
qwaWd14vaa	You gave him the phone to use, not to keep. You have the contract on the phone and it is in your name, so it is legally your property.<br>  You can call the police and ask to file a report. It is up to each officer to decide if the giving was an action that is criminally legal or a civil matter.<br>  If civil, it become your case to file a report or a complaint with the courts about your phone.|`|9Gsx32Skaa	if you want your phone back you need to involve the police. He  knows that the phone is not his property and by refusing to give it back he has stolen from you. As much as you want to protect him because hes underage, its not a good idea because if you let it go he has won and what will be the next thing he thinks he can get away with stealing? so yes, its a good idea to have an officer with you next time when you go and ask for your phone.|`|AA10347782	Are you in the USA or UK? Tell the kid to promptly return your phone or you will file a "theft of property complaint" with the police. If the police find the phone on the kid (and you can verify the phone is yours)<br>  More likely then not the police will charge the kid with theft or robbery.|`|b8svqAMAaa	If you lent it to someone then technically it is not considered stolen.  It now becomes a civil problem and you have to take them to civil court to get it back.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You can not take an officer with you as a scare tactic or to intimidate the person to get your phone back.|`|liFhCVbqaa	Need support? Were here to help :)<br>  <a href="http://psychluvr11.webs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://psychluvr11.webs.com/</a>|`|SucJkedyaa	You can and should go to the police. He has stolen your phone. If you have witnesses, let them provide affidavits and testimony on your behalf. And anything that can prove that the phone is yours-bill of sale/receipt, warranty, etc. will be helpful. He may insist that you gave it to him, so you need to prepare for that angle. This is where witnesses will be really helpful. Or if the phone is expensive and new, then it would be unlikely that you gave it to him. Whatever you do, don't leave him with it or let him get away with it. File a police report, report the problem to school security and perhaps the head of the school and take him to Small Claims court if you don't ever get the phone back, so that you can at least get the value of the phone back in cash. You should also consider talking to his parents/guardians. That may save you the effort of filing a police report since they may be able to get it back from him for you. Chances are that he's done this before. Good luck.
uCi1LPAzaa	The store has the right to refuse service to anyone and to ban anyone from their store.  It sucks that your friend got hit with the "guilt by association" bit, but maybe now she will be more careful when she selects her friends, or at least who she goes shopping with.<br>  <br>  She may try this: write a letter to the manager (or owner if it's not a chain) apologizing for what happened in the past.  Assure the manager/owner that she regrets what happened and has learned from the event.  Be specific in what she learned (actions vs. consequences, etc).  She can ask for a second chance but also understand that if she screws up a second time they will without a doubt ban her for good.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	All stores have the right to refuse service to anyone.

She even went to court and everything. Then there are people who  can't come in anymore even though its been a few years. Its really up to the manager and the employees. If its a store with a high turnover or high theft rate the chances of them recognizing her is low, but if the manager really wants to be a butthole he could call the police on her if she came back in as being a disturbance.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would to call the store and just ask them the rule. People come into my store all the time that have been caught stealing, the way the economy is going a lot of people are grateful for the sale- and just designate an employee to closely watch them. But then again being followed and watched at a store makes me not want to shop there...|`|AA10549579	the ban will stay (you can vote, no curfew,and you go to reg/real jail for crimes, you can go to some clubs)

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Blackmail is a crime.  Contact the police and follow their instructions.  As for suing, keep your mouth shut about that for now.  Wait until he is convicted of a crime...and then you can sue in civil court.  Besides, you can't sue in civil court while a criminal case is in progress as evidence obtained from the defendant can be used to convict him in criminal court and there are laws about that (ie. criminal comes first, THEN civil court).<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If you were that drunk, you may be able to charge him with sexual assault by diminished capacity, meaning you did not have the capacity to say no. Even if you cannot get him for the assault: Call the police and report him for extortion. Demanding money in exchange for withholding potentially damaging information (or in this case, video) is illegal, and he can go to prison for it. Call the police immediately. Speak to an attorney about getting an injunction against him showing the video tape to anyone, but do that AFTER you tell the police you want to press charges against him for the extortion.|`|tcA1w24jaa	LOL, s*ut.<br>  <br>  Yes, if he is threatening you with releasing the tape if you don't pay him, it's blackmail, and he'll go to prison.<br>  <br>  To "Sue him for everything he's got" you're going to have to prove he was financially damaging to you, which will be a long shot.<br>  <br>  Call the cops, but don't be a golddigger.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	If you have written proof, the police could probably confiscate the tape as evidence.
mSrnLnNcaa	Answer to Q1.  On September 11th 2001 a group of 11 individuals belonging to the Islamic extremist group Al Quiada, Hijacked four planes, crashing two of them into the twin towers in New York, one of them into the pentagon. the fourth planes target is unknown as it never reached it. A group of heroes retook the plane and crashed it into a Pennsylvania field. It is believed that the target was either camp David or the white house.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer to Q2. There are two areas that are constantly attacked about the official version of 9-11. #1 is that the steel used to construct the twin towers burns at an extremely high temperature, a temperature that no fire can reach. #2 deals with the pentagon. at the crash site, there was no wings of the plane found and recovered, moreover the hole at the plane went through is not big enough to have a plane go through.

AA10287176	That's an interesting question. How much they will have to adapt in the short term depends on a lot of factors. If, for example, Obama's plans go badly and he and the Democrats lose their standing with the public, it is possible that the GOP would not have to adapt any further to win the next election. That might not be the most likely scenario; however, which is likely why the GOP is has put minorities and women in front. If you listen to Republicans, it is obvious that many of them see the GOP's problems as largely superficial and not related to their ideological principles - many say that the party needs to get back to its roots or that it was punished for abandoning conservatism, or otherwise imply that the party was with the problem, not the principles.<br>  <br>  This doesn't seem to be the case, though, and beyond the near-term, I do think that the GOP is going to have to enact significant changes in its platform and ideology to remain competitive. We are already seeing this with many Republicans embracing the reality of global warming and acknowledging the importance of it and other environmental issues. This is an area that the GOP has consistently ridiculed, but it is doubtful that the GOP will ever field another presidential candidate who doesn't believe in global warming. Bush was likely the last.<br>  <br>  Another big thing that will likely have to shift is the fetisization of small government. Widespread deregulation is, thanks to the economic crisis, largely discredited, and with th economy unlikely to improve anytime soon, many more people will favor welfare and other social policies which were unpopular in more prosperous times. If Obama's economic policy is successful, it will likely do to small-government ideology what the New Deal did decades ago.<br>  <br>  Also, the national demographics are changing in ways that do not favor the GOP (higher proportion of minorities), and it is not likely that fronting black or hispanic candidates who vote like white conservatives is going to get the GOP very far. Other issues like the likely greater acceptance of gay marriage in the coming years, the move of Hispanics in South Florida away from the GOP, and the bad impression that Bush made on the young people of today (future voters of tomorrow) also indicate some difficulty for the GOP in the future.<br>  <br>  Sorry to go on for so long, but I think this is an interesting topic. It will be great to watch how it plays out over the long-term.|`|B42PBRk6aa	Don't worry.

It will have the fine and your various options.  If you take care of the ticket through the mail (or in most counties on line) you don't have to go to court.<br>  <br>  The statewide schedule for a violation of Veh C 22450(a) is $201.  Your fine will be close to that.  You will be allowed to go to traffic school.  That will cost a bit more, but keep it off your record (with your driving record, one point is probably not going to affect your insurance, still it is nice to keep it clean).   You've already found the web site, so you can probably take care of the ticket there (it will take a few days for it to be entered in the system).

Very nice of him.  There's no question of his good intentions or of his heroism.

You ignore a part of the whole picture in order to pose your loaded """questions""".<br>  <br>  But anyway:<br>  <br>  A) Ask Reagan and the Bushes. They have done all they could to gift and regift the ultrawealthy at the expense of a swelling underclass in a poor service economy. Corporate welfare, outsourcing and all that.<br>  <br>  B) No. And every time a Republican is in office, the deficit grows and our indebtedness to other nations climbs. Why? Because in this way the GOP makes GOP presidencies appear like fat times, when in fact they are borrowed against future generations' wealth. True.<br>  <br>  C) Irrevelant point. The insurance cartels are less efficient than the government, and furthmore, every time an insurance company takes over a hospital, the cost of care rises further out of reach.<br>  <br>  D) And your point is? The population in 2000 is many times what it was in 1940. So 5.5% is a dauntingly significant number in 2000. <br>  <br>  Since the insurance companies have become such a dark cartel with the power to play God with men's lives, the cost of health care has risen to absurd levels. A doctor's visit cost $10 in the midwest in 1965. Now, it costs $100, and that's if they do nothing but check your pulse and tell you to take aspirin.<br>  <br>  There are millions and millions who lack insurance and access  to healthcare. Again, because GOP policy swells the underclass in a service economy, fewer and fewer can afford real, decent healthcare. (I can. But I am one of the lucky ones.)|`|9qvMKZg3aa	Barack Hussein Obama's CHANGE proposals won't work and Barack Hussein Obama knows it.<br>  <br>  The offer of CHANGE is just the vehicle to get into power.<br>  <br>  When I think of Terrorist / Traitor Barack Hussein Obama and his blind followers I recall the following similar events in World History.<br>  <br>  The people of all of these countries didn't think what ultimately happened in their countries could happen there either.<br>  <br>  The German people were in a depression and desperate for CHANGE.

He figure the US needed a<br>  semi-automatic rifle for the field.<br>  However, the US was already trying to fill orders for the<br>  "1903 Springfield rifle" for the military.<br>  So he came up with a concept called the "Penderson Device", which<br>  was simply this..<br>  You take the "bolt action unit" off your military issued "1903" and<br>  replace it with a Penderson Device. Turning your bolt action rifle to<br>  a semi-automatic rifle.<br>  It fired the came caliber bullet except the <br>  cartridge was smaller, however the clip could hold 40 bullets. And after you<br>  fired your 40 bullets you replaced it with another clip rather fast. The US military<br>  was so impressed with it, they placed a large ordered for the units.<br>  Unfortuntely, the first 5000 units were sent to Europe in 1918, however as soon as<br>  they arrived Germany surrender. Thus the Penderson Device was never used in combat.<br>  History' Channel "Mail Call" host R. Lee Ermey that test fired the<br>  device and said, "If this was used in WW1, this wouuld have been<br>  the world's first assault rifle".<br>  <br>  As for a machine gun, you have to get a special permit to even<br>  pocess a fully automatic machine gun.<br>  You fill out Federal US Form, submit your fingerprints to the<br>  FBI so they can do a background check, and pay a $2000.00<br>  fee to process it.<br>  If you pass the FBI background check, you will get a federal license to<br>  own a machine gun. This process has been in existance since 1934,<br>  and there was ONLY ONE CASE of a legally own machine gun used<br>  in a crime. It was done by a policeman.<br>  <br>  Now, any gun that is semi-automatic can be legally own by<br>  anybody. <br>  Having a fully automatic gun is illegal.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - -|`|OHn91mP1aa	I've never understood the argument from pro-assault weapon folks that citizens need to own such weapons as some sort of method of keeping the government in check.  <br>  <br>  First, it's not as if our military is going to be afraid of some schmoes with AK-47's.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if it really comes down to citizens having to overthrow our government...at that point do we really care if we have that government's permission to own guns?|`|MoUtk7cUaa	it is, read the constitution and the bill of rights.  however, the amendment is mostly for the purpose of controlling the govt (the need for a militia), and the way things are going, we're gonna need a revolution soon. however, i also think that owning a assualt rifle is not nec, but it's still my right.|`|o8xvzhuhaa	To allow the common people access to WMK(weapons of mass killing) is in my opinion insane.

I've watched his program often enough to know that he doesn't propose the legalization of rapid fire machine guns. And I'd like to see some evidence that Dobbs supports private ownership of Howitzers.<br>  <br>  I agree that there has to be a limit to what the 2nd amendment protects. Rapid fire machine guns are illegal and they should remain illegal. <br>  <br>  A couple of years ago, I went into a pawn shop, and there, on the front counter, was a 50 caliber, single fire, sniper rifle. That concerned me a good bit. If you've ever seen a 50 caliber cartridge, you understand why. It is capable of bringing down a jet airliner. But, I suppose it's legal, because it's a single shot and not a rapid fire machine gun.<br>  <br>  A 50 caliber sniper rifle can't be used for hunting, because there wouldn't be anything left to whatever you shot. It's not practical for target practice. A 50 cal sniper rifle has only one purpose. To kill anything within a mile.|`|UO27uZnraa	I think that there has to be some restrictions. <br>  I mean how would you feel if there was none and your neighbor went out and bought a bunch of nuclear weapons and then mishandled them! <br>  Freedom ends when someone else's freedom is at stake.

The second amendment was written long before we had the types of weapons we do today.  Even assault rifles won't defend us against tyranny, so the right to have assault rifles is kind of moot.<br>  <br>  Maybe I'm wrong, I admit.  But a line has to be drawn somewhere.  I don't believe in strictly controlling all guns.  However, I would not be allowed to own nuclear or biological weapons, but the Constitution doesn't address that either.  The question is simply where to draw the line.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	I agree.|`|AA10782769	The thing you have to realize is that an AK47 or an AR15 or any other so called "assault rifle" is really no more dangerous than a "hunting rifle" as you call it. AK47's are chambered for the 7.62X39 cartridge which is a smaller round than many hunting rifles use. AR15's use the 5.56 round which is the same as a .223 round that hunters use for small game.  Handguns are more concealable than "assault rifles".  People tend to make to much out of assault rifles because they cosmetically look like selective fire automatic military rifles.  As for legally purchased full auto weapons you really have to check the stats as to how many of these are used illegally.  Trust me it's rare.  In other words when you boil it all down all the hoopla about assault rifles and machine guns is....just that.  As much as most people hate to admit it people who want to ban assault rifles and machine guns are not knowledgeable enough about firearms to know the difference between an assault rifle and a conventional hunting rifle.  As for our 2nd amendment rights I believe we have to be very careful when we start allowing people with no knowledge of firearms to tell us what guns we can and cant have.

Here are a few of the factors in the high cost of the death penalty - they apply to any case where capital punishment is a possible sentence:<br>  <br>  ? more pre-trial time will be needed to prepare: cases typically take a year to come to trial<br>  ? more pre-trial motions will be filed and answered<br>  ? more experts will be hired <br>  ? twice as many attorneys will be appointed for the defense, and a comparable team for the prosecution<br>  ? jurors will have to be individually quizzed on their views about the death penalty, and they are more likely to be sequestered<br>  ? two trials instead of one will be conducted: one for guilt and one for punishment<br>  ? the trial will be longer: a cost study at Duke University estimated that death penalty trials take 3 to 5 times longer than typical murder trials<br>  <br>  These costs apply whether or not there is a conviction or a death sentence.|`|L6Ko87r9aa	Innocent until proven guilty.<br>  <br>  And sometimes, proving them guilty takes a very long time.<br>  <br>  Remember OJ's case?

Regardless of what you think about abortion, it is clear that these organizations do valuable work in impovershed areas, as family planning is a key part of economic development. <br>  <br>  You can read an article about it here:<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090131/ap_on_re_af/af_africa_obama_abortion;_ylt=AnxfpmOx9OPmTVmLYHuslj.96Q8F">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090131/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  Even organizations which do not and did not provide abortions could and did, under the previous policy, have their funding cut. Additionally, the funds cut were not necessarily those for abortion; an organization which provided abortion services only with local financing and used American funding to distribute condoms in an area with a high AIDS rate would have that funding cut. Making the claim that Obama's decision on this matter was really just about funding abortions overseas is really inaccurate.<br>  <br>  P.S.

eMYOiim8aa	Capitalism is always for profit and always divides into different segments so as to keep the more wealthy above the rest.  It is basically built on greed and fame for the top earners. It tries to fool others into believing that everyone has a fair shot in becoming monetarily prosperous which isn't always so, as some people are just not capable of achieving wealth.  Human society proves there have always been the majority who serve the master.  There are those who are favored because of their social status and who will also profit greatly from someone else in order to keep themselves at the top even if it discredits those who fall.   On the other hand, there are those who honestly earned their position and their wealth.  People who want to keep this type system are leaders and followers, the ones who strive to the top who want more and those who want someone who they can look to who rules the roost and at the same time want a sustainable lifestyle that gives them at least their basic needs. No one wants to be at the very bottom, at least not by any choice of their own.  As long as Capitalism reigns,  not everyone will have free choice, because that is how Capitalism is designed to work.|`|roAahzkIaa	You pretty much answered your own questions who is at fault....

Democracy may not be perfect, but it is a whole site better than any other system out there.|`|AA10482044	Out of context it doesn't make sense but if you understand that Marx considered shoveling coal to be real work but giving the orders to shovel coal merely the business of a government of equals and government as the replacement for the middle and upper classes who were all to live equally - well they made it work up to a point, the government had the power instead of the rich and managerial classes which isn't as efficient usually and provides many counter productive incentives.  However compared to the earliest models of industrial capitalism and rule by monarchies and rich political classes it was a huge leap forward that kept pressure on the rich and powerful not to enslave their working classes while pausing to think where they might end up given similar revolutions in the West..|`|PBq7ODPzaa	So, according to Marx, since I work I have nothing...yet, I have a house (I am paying for it but it is mine) 2 cars (that were paid off in 2 years) and all the furnishings in said house.

He admits (whether it's true or not is another matter) that in the society he knew that anyone who has acquired wealth does nothing.  So why this would dismiss the objection that if you take away private reward and reward everyone that no one would work is a mystery to me.  <br>  <br>  I guess his point was that wealth is not the reason we work--that the poor work and don't get wealth, while the wealthy don't work and are still wealthy.  He's half right--but half truths are more dangerous than complete lies.   And a lot of this may have been more true in the economy he knew than in the economy of today.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	He was an intellectual, without dealing with sociopolitical realities; and this made his work the blueprint for corruption and power mongering and the most bloody dictator of the 20th century.|`|AA11696297	Karl Marx was a genius.  if you cannot see the truth of this observation, you're just not paying attention.|`|AA11424005	I don't agree with anything Karl Marx wrote or said.

It's their belief that it's our responsibility to do so, and that we cannot make reasonable decisions about who to help and when.

In their minds, forced taxation for welfare programs = charity, and it's okay to be codependent when people choose to fail.  I know people have rough circumstances and that we are all susceptible to falling on difficult times.  In those cases, we should all want to lift one another up and help, and I believe that most of us do just that.

Fannie and Freddie finally popped the bubble with the government approved minority housing program.

It's 100% a product of inflation. The housing market and credit crisis are only effects and not the cause. Inflation is the culprit. Look at every other economy in history to inflate it's money supply, VERY short lifespan. Gold and silver lasts forever.|`|mTwn8p79aa	I know, seriously, it was so great right before that.  None of us could have seen this coming.<br>  <br>  Wait, wait, wait, you're telling me this is still us dealing with things from Bush's policy?  But, that was like . . . four whole weeks ago.

As in the first bombing of the Trade Center. Bush turned such over to the Feds, the military after 9 - 11.<br>  <br>  Obama's policy is going back to how Clinton handled it. <br>  <br>  Neither man served in the military. and so on.

It's not that I don't believe you, but you should back up your claims.|`|IHIiyyCTaa	Who !|`|oMOiAFRBaa	Homegirl is 100% wrong, 99.9% of the racist attacks against Obama were actually coming from Hillary Democrats, not from Republicans.  Republicans even came out against people making racist comments against Obama.  McCain laid the smackdown on Bill Cunningham for dropping "H-bombs" during a rally and set one old lady straight when she thought that Barack Obama was an Arab.  I didn't see Hillary Clinton condemn any of the democrats who said Obama was a Muslim, a Terrorist, a Muslim Terrorist, or a Kenyan Muslim Terrorist, including Philip Berg, who is continuing his lawsuit accusing Obama of not being eligible for the presidency.<br>  <br>  The Republicans have not been playing racism through this whole elections the way the dems have.|`|vwYbFtkqaa	After the hate that was spewed at Obama Republicans can only expect similar comparisons regarding religion, cultural beliefs and practices and education to come back at Gov.

Racists.|`|FVDhYH6Baa	no not the ones i know|`|X23hkjIPaa	What people don't understand is that there is no room for racism anywhere. I get it that people are raised a certain way, to think some races are inferior to others. I happen to disagree. <br>  With regards to Obama, I want to give the guy a chance and see what comes of all this. Many of the provisions in this bill are questionable, at best. He will have to live with the consequences of allowing them to remain if they fail to produce jobs. The color of the mans skin Obama or Jindal is irrelevant!!! Get it through your heads people.|`|vRY2vExRaa	Why so serious?  Don't you know when your leg is being pulled?  I suspect you'll find far more right wingers who actually BELIEVE that Obama is a muslim or born in some other country, a communist,etc., than you will find libs who dislike Jindal because of his ethnicity.|`|HZy629kLaa	They shouldn't, it is wrong.  But I'm sure you've seen some racist Obama material here.  Good thing you were against it.|`|Mlf7Kss4aa	Why are Obama bashers now starting to be sensitive about someone color?|`|57fbb9da33f2c677b05957f815062f52aa	Because they are racist.  Who did not see that coming.|`|LzsGNlOraa	You expect rational from liberals?|`|BWvIllhKaa	You are trully an hypocrite if you use racism against Obama and then get upset when it is done to one of your own.<br>  <br>  Edit - Well to clarify what I said, I didn't say that you said that. I meant all the ones who were racists towards Obama. Both sides are hypocrites on this issue. I never said to anyone that was against Obama that they were racists and I will never use any racism towards anyone and even less towards people I do not agree with.
UvzKiis0aa	You know the way to stop this is to start outsourcing jobs like doctor, lawyer, CEO, politician.  Those jobs can also be done cheaper and with the same qualtiy by Chinese peasants.  When everyone starts hurting, protectionism and tariffs might start sounding good.<br>  <br>  I hang up when I call a company's 800 number and get a call center in India.  I look up the local number, call them and tell them I want my business handled by Americans or I am pulling my business.<br>  <br>  Obviously GC didn't get the memo that white collar jobs are gone too.  Companies like Microsoft imported H1Bs from India and China to drive down the salaries of people with computer and business degrees who have invested thousands in their educations, only to be laid off.  Now those businesses are going to India, China, and wherever they can get the lowest labor costs.  <br>  <br>  The government makes laws and regulations to formulate a certain outcome.  Protectionism is practiced by every other country in the world including China.  The USA is stupidly giving up its manufacturing base to corporate greed.  It is corporate greed not the unions who drive out the jobs.  And it is our government's job to stop the bleeding.|`|iScNZJWSaa	You obviously do not understand a global economy.<br>  <br>  Yes we import.  But, because we import, we are also allowed to export.  And, with every import, American jobs are still created in the transportaion, distribution and retail sell of those goods that are imported.<br>  <br>  There are also duties and taxes paid on all imports.  In addition to countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties attached to imports.  These duties are determined by our government to insure that any imported item will essentially cost the same to produce and import from another country, as it would to produce here in the U.S. at a reasonable level.<br>  <br>  The problem is greedy unions and people...who expect to get paid 75,000.00 + benefits at GM for simply working an assembly line and screwing a nut on a bolt.   If you want to make decent money, get an education...find a career that deserves a good salary...and don't expect to get paid big bucks for menial jobs.|`|yYbAF1hHaa	at this rate<br>  <br>  americans will be building and buying <br>  <br>  RICKSHAWS<br>  <br>  ha ha h ah ha hahah ahhah

Does James Brady have a lot of coffin photos - and did Obama ask one to be hung in the White House?<br>  <br>  Yes, war is a waste.  What can Obama do to prevent more wars?  Do you think H. Clinton's more open and commerce oriented statesmanship will lessen the likelihood of the US getting into another war?|`|ciQFlpuLaa	the Civil War wasn't a waste. it preserved the Union and led to the Emancipation Proclamation. your great great grandfather, along with the other soldiers, died for a noble cause. and i don't think Obama carries any photos.|`|Si2qL6Gaaa	no he doesnt need to, half of america know wars are bad, the other half are sad body bags arent comming back from Iran now - fiquire that out

Human trafficking has been going on in the US since I was a little boy.  Most people don't care because a majority of the people being trafficked are foreigners, immigrants or US citizens with foreign accents/appearance that have had their identities stolen.<br>  <br>  This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue.  Republicans turned a blind eye to it too.  This is something all good and decent people must oppose.|`|Aej3lgQZaa	I am unaware of that, but I am more fearful of what is going on INSIDE the country. Like Detroit is an uninhabital wasteland now.

Also, in AZ, officers are THREATENED if they try to enforce immigration laws. How about that? Thank Janet N. who was governor until OBAMA nominated the useless beeotch to the Dept. of Homeland Security. Isn't that like hiring arsonists to run the fire station?|`|t0366Ldxaa	Republicans (especially Bush) have fought immigration reform for years because cheap labor is a boom to big business.<br>  <br>  And frankly I doubt if you can point to 400 kidnappings in Phoenix with any solid evidence.|`|N4ORX2fZaa	Its not a Republican or Democratic issue.  They are both dodging the issue of illegal immigration.  Once side wants cheap labor and the other wants more voters.

2elJq4THaa	This is dependant on which force he is intending to join as they are moving the goal posts all the time.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do would be to contact the force that he wants to join and ask them what the requirements are.<br>  <br>  I will say however that the fitness tests are not that hard if you have a reasonable level of fitness.  They usually consist of a short bleep test run usually to level 5.4 (if that means anything) and a push/pull test to 34/35 kg average which is easy for your average bloke as usually you can get results in the 80kg range without a huge amount of effort.<br>  <br>  As for interviews, again dependant on which force you apply to.  When I joined there was only a short 20 minute interview which was one to one.  They do however do a panel interview now.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|f8ewmXsXaa	tbh there not anything like military standard so he can relax and they seldom check after the initial tests that's why we have so many police that couldn't catch a granny lol with a few exceptions
4f3cjyw7aa	Well, liberals (Democrats) like taxing everything, taking away guns, and supporting abortion.  So just talk about how abortion laws will be expanded, gun laws will become more restrictive, and taxes will go up.<br>  <br>  All of that aside, it sounds like you have a tough homework assignment.  You could also talk about abolition of the death penalty (something Democrats also support).  Pretty much anything that is controversial will probably be fine for your assignment.

AA11494150	For a successful lawsuit, you need to prove two things: negligence and damages. Damages are certainly evident here, and I'm sorry for your loss.

Why do you feel a need to blame anyone else for this tragedy?|`|o8xvzhuhaa	The answer to the question is yes, but you might have been asking should we sue the hospital. <br>  <br>  It depends if the hospital knew about him being suicidal. You need to prove that they knew about it. Also, you need to prove that even if they did know that they did not take any precautions to the case in which he might commit suicide.|`|evnj2DUpaa	Yes, they are entitled to keep him safe and under watch. If they failed to do that job, you have every right to sue them. I am really sorry about your loss. You should probably back up your reasons with references, that's just a suggestion. Good luck getting what you deserve! By the way you have to find some way to prove negligence. I recommend a lawyer for help.

These countries breed and produce people that actively seek out innocent people and brutally kill them.<br>  <br>  Defending your country is not an act of terrorism, even if innocent people are killed involuntarily in the process. Otherwise every single country that ever dropped a bomb could be classified as terrorist.|`|XPSIn3wxaa	Radical Muslims where ever they live.<br>  <br>  The reason, they do not tolerate anyone other than Radical Muslims.

Why is that?|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No.  Democrats aren't paranoid of Jindal or Palin.  Based on Jindal's speech and Palin's performance in the last election, Obama will have a cakewalk to re-election if his challenger in 2012 is either Jindal or Palin.  Democrats are a little concerned that so many conservatives believe either Jindal or Palin would be competent commanders-in-chief, though.|`|aFC72tLZaa	No, we love him.  He's a prime example of a conservative right winger.  No common sense and funny looking.  To you racists:  Barack will fix the bushed up economy and George will be found guilty of war crimes.

JOXQrsw0aa	AFROTC Cadets can live wherever they want. Training is on campus. It is not like Boot Camp. Weekly AFROTC classes, Drill and PT(Physical Training.) Usually there is an on campus lounge where  Cadets can hang out.    Field Training Encampments over the Summer. <br>  <br>  All AFROTC Courses are generally the same.  <br>  <br>  There is a description of the Course and the classes at Berkeley AFROTC here:<br>  <a href="http://airforcerotc.berkeley.edu/_afrotc-program.htm" rel="nofollow">http://airforcerotc.berkeley.edu/_afrotc...</a><br>  <br>  This is from Berkeley's website:<br>  <a href="http://military.berkeley.edu/usaf.html" rel="nofollow">http://military.berkeley.edu/usaf.html</a><br>  <br>  "Both the two-year and the four-year AFROTC programs emphasize student participation and involvement. Classes are conducted as seminars and call for active student discussion. In addition, there is a weekly two-hour leadership laboratory that is mandatory for all AFROTC cadets. In this laboratory, students become involved in the management of their own cadet organization. Students also participate in projects, visits to Air Force bases, and orientation flights.<br>  <br>  Completion of the program to earn an Air Force commission requires enrollment during each semester in a specified course in Aerospace Studies or Military Affairs. The normal sequence for the four-year program is as follows: AS 1, AS 24, AS 2A, AS 2B, AS 135A, AS 135B, MA 145A, MA 145B. Students enrolled in the two-year program need only take the upper division courses. All courses count for credit."<br>  <br>   UW AFROTC website:<br>  <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/afrotc/" rel="nofollow">http://depts.washington.edu/afrotc/</a><br>  Good Luck!|`|GwYsSNvBaa	i did ROTC for a year at my college....<br>  we had class once a week, a 2-3 hour lab each week, and MWF pt's at 6 in the morning.  there were a few weekends where off campus training was conducted. it was only required for those actually enlisted/ing  if not it was optional. the labs were basic skills and such. i still stayed in my own dorm and was only required to wear uniform during lab and pt. oh also the first two years were "freebies" you did not have to enlist unless you wanted to take the third year.|`|Jf8T1WHKaa	Not like boot camp. Yes you live in a dorm. You will do all your training wherever the ROTC class is, or maybe somewhere off campus depending on what your doing. It's kinda like being in the reserves, You live your life, and train a few times per week. Which is more than the reserves but whatever. ROTC is a good program to do from what I've read. Good Luck!|`|xNlh2LPHaa	It's not like boot camp.  At most schools, you live where you want.<br>  <br>  You'll take classes for four years and they will teach you about being an officer.  You will probably do PT a few times a week as well.  Check out the website below, I'm sure you can find a lot of answers.  If you still have more questions, contact them, they'll be happy to answer your questions.|`|7n523JW1aa	Not at all like boot camp. More like a University believe it or not.|`|3xTNOevjaa	No, not as harsh as a bootcamp, more training and learning the life as an officer in the military. You would live in a dorm if your college offers it. You do your training in where the director has appointed.
PSc1BEZTaa	It has gotten this bad since Obama took Office, it as always been bad, but now it is spilling over, Obama is to busy hearing himself talk and fishing for approval, he probably does not even know that there is an Enemy infiltrating our land.... <br>  There was a policeman beheaded today, did any news show it? No....there was no Glamor there!|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	Obama believes in the open border.<br>  <br>  DTG|`|uxT5okWKaa	Why are you only bringing this up on Obamas watch? You are allowing your sourgrapes attitude that Obama won to further your ridiculous bias. Its very typical and very Unamerican. I doubt you make enough money to truly support the right, who seem to only support their Uber rich friends in much higher places.<br>  Obama has just started his job and here you are blaming him for everything that happened on Bush's watch! How convenient! <br>  Try to think for yourself for a change!|`|HZy629kLaa	Sounds like Rick Perry should be doing something about it....Wouldn't want big government getting in the way...Maybe private industry should step in, like XE/Blackwater.<br>  <br>  Could it be that republicans want to change the subject?   Hmmm.|`|Hb7TW09saa	think the states gov's should be working on it. i'm sure obama will address it at some point..we have this little economic global crisis going on.
2gx2LgzEaa	There too busy giving Obama googly eyes to pay any attention to anything else. <br>  <br>  And course obama knows, it was 2 days after carter was given the peace priize for NK that they announced there nukes the first time.<br>  <br>  He just doesnt know what to do about it, and according to the media, his dog is bigger news...<br>  <br>  Sad isint it?|`|OWk5POwVaa	Wow.  People like you shouldn't vote.  Not that it helps if you do anyway, because the vast majority of people have learned from their mistakes (George Bush) are obviously intelligent, because they chose Barack Obama as president.  Now sit down, shut up, and deal with it.|`|tvNkizDraa	Link please?  I'd like to see the source of information that you're using, a source that apparently Obama might or might not have at his grasp.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	Iran was only a TINY country when Carter was Pres too....<br>  They kicked his butt big time.|`|c3vPZfghaa	So when you turn on a nuclear power plant it produces nuclear missiles?<br>  So that is the reason we have to keep paying weapon manufacturers to disassemble them.<br>  Why don't we save ourselves some money and shut down all of our nuclear power plants?<br>  Like wow thanks for clarifying that. And all this time, I thought they produced electricity.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Obama knows. He doesn't really care.

And it is NOT good.|`|QX2xnrhWaa	Iran is not the enemy of the United States.  It is the enemy of a foreign country we've been giving huge amounts of money every year for decades, not ours.|`|i9V7t3pRaa	We are paying attention.  Obama thinks they will stop because he is the messiah.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	There is no such thing as a "nookyewloor missile".|`|DypTl9Zdaa	Of course he knows.  He's has done nothing so far expect blab about terrorists and he doesn't seem to concern himself much because why would all his buddies attack us now that he's at the helm?|`|jVUEohsNaa	There ya go...

I saw him dancing the other night.|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Didn't hear him mention it last night during his speech, but then he was too busy running for 2012 Pres. election!|`|MVLnWyTraa	Kind of like the saying, " while the cat is away, the mouse will play?<br>  America is stuck on stupid, so Osama Bin Laden was right in saying America will be destroyed from the inside out!<br>  <br>  And if you go to any other News than American News you will find out in minutes, that Iran is playing with their Bomb...<br>  and here nobody cares.......amazing!...|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Why Not, Bush sat here for 8 years and watched them and did nothing but talk.
Hxttt7G0aa	They are a company created run and owned by liberals, some of the very richest democrats. They do have an agenda and they are working to skew information available as far as I have been able to decern all of their actions are consistent with this goal, to skew information available and mislead the voters in the US and other countries as it's been done in many other sources including TV and schools. Information control is extremely important to facsists. They are part of the facist democrat movement.|`|cbDfpfYKaa	ROFL!  It has nothing to do with being in support of the Democrat agenda, and everything to do with who is pushing the "Report Abuse" button while you're on.  The other night after Obama's speech, anything that insinuated he did a good job was gone in less than 5 seconds.|`|ZkMfdTgBaa	I see negative questions about the Democrats all the time.  One guy even has an avatar with a picture of President Obama and the word ASSHOLE in red letters across the Presidents face.  If that does not violate community standards, then I guess your questions must really be out there.|`|AA11105711	I had a question removed questioning republican policies.  Perhaps you are too biased to see that it happens to the other side too.|`|dn0aF6lOaa	It has NOTHING to do with Yahoo Answers...  I have posted many questions which question Republican ways and they get deleted anytime someone doesn't like the question, being called out of the facts,  or simply can't answer it..  It is going both ways and both types of questions seem to get deleted..  I asked a question just 2 days ago about how many times Rush Limbaugh and fox news will lie or twist the meaning of Obamas speech the other night and it was deleted stating that it wasn't fit for children.   This is really getting out of hand but is nothing more then just a bunch of idiots on BOTH sides running around hitting the report abuse button simply because they don't like the question or the answer.  The fault lies with Yahoo Answers for not taking the time to actually read  the question and just taking the  abuse reporters word for it..<br>  <br>  EDIT:   I see now by your added comments that you are simply a Republican in sheep's clothing...  Nice try though..<br>  <br>  If by chance you really are a Democrat turned sour, I would suggest that you research the reasons that turned you and not just believe what some of these republican cult members are trying to feed you..  This has been the republicans game EVERY time a Democrat takes office.. History (Clinton, Kennedy, etc  etc) will prove that but this time it's gotten alot nastier due to the fact Obama has almost an 80% approval rating.. I went back and read some of your previous answers to some pretty ridiculous questions and statements and see you are falling hook line and sinker for their lies and distortions. The key to this is RESEARCH not just assuming it as fact because some cult followers says it's fact. Remember those statements are coming from less then 10% of the entire country.  Remember also.. Obama is a DIRECT THREAT to the future existance of the Republican Party and they aren't taking it well.|`|4a2b4c38598195f530e54c08fa3e232aaa	Most likely this question will be reported too since it really has nothing to do with politics and is a whiny rant on your part.  That's probably the issue with alot of content that gets deleted whether it be democrat or republican.<br>  <br>  But like Scrappy just pointed out.  Gay marriage and abortion haven't been whined about for at least an hour now.  Maybe you can write something about that.|`|EwdsfwUyaa	You are right there is systematic and demonstrable bias.<br>  <br>  The moderators are themselves liberal Democrats who tolerate abusive name calling by liberals and censor politely worded conservative posts by the hour.<br>  <br>  Questions such as yours that question the even handedness of Yahoo Answers staff are routinely deleted so read people's answers while you still can.<br>  <br>  People are keeping an eye on this and making a public record of Yahoo.  Look at the YouTube videos under YahooCensorship and others. (see link)|`|nkr0Nvemaa	I have seen questions that are about his not being american, others with racial slurs, and many that were nothing but hate speech and posed no question. None of these were deleted so I can only imagine you are a liar or your "questions" are really just outrageous statements dripping with prejudice and hatred.|`|GaGSjIkNaa	Now you and other conservatives are stating Yahoo! Answers has "media bias". Give me a break...<br>  <br>  People ON YAHOO! ANSWERS are reporting people, not certain political parties. If they deem it to be in violation, then they violate you. It's that simple. It's not bias. It's ridiculous to believe that it is a bias thing...|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	Stop with your non-sense.. The same thing happens when you ask a rant fueled question about Republicans.<br>  <br>  You rant, it gets pulled. Doesn't matter what the topic is.|`|peEHzKGDaa	Because maybe the topic of your ranting is too repetitive.  Try whining about a NEW issue.  I think gay marriage hasn't been touched for 10 minutes... give it a go.|`|ly4INzzTaa	I have put up plenty of answers in opposition to dems and just don't see what you are talking about.|`|o0JEkGCjaa	It goes both ways.|`|F3kiXNUEaa	It works both ways,  there are people who report questions on both ends of the political spectrum,  Democrats and Republicans.<br>  <br>  My questions have been deleted plenty of times by Sarah Palin fanatics.<br>  <br>  Also, you can not  say a wrong word against Jeebus without some Jesus freak being offended.|`|12m9145haa	Hmmmmm. Seems like nothing but Repubs in her to me. Maybe they're only trying to eliminate the silliness so people can have an intelligent discussion about politics and avoid the childish name calling.|`|fPMVuB87aa	of course
EuGsGfuJaa	Well, I'm a pretty liberal democrat (we're not all stupid).  I can't help but think:<br>  <br>  Drug lords and gangs are going to commit acts of violence no matter what little technicalities we makes for the criminal justice system to snag them.  They'll keep doing it.<br>  <br>  Now a question to bake your noodles is, would they still be so keen on doing violence if citizens SHOT BACK?|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	It won't stop drug lords from committing violent crimes with or without assualt weapons.  Drug lords are law breakers...  They don't acquire assault weapons legally as it is.  They will just get them illegally now.  It's just one more law they will break.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Ignorance mostly; sometimes with a little stupidity thrown in.<br>  <br>  You must realize that most of those characters calling themselves "liberals" have, in fact, never even SEEN a firearm. They have no clue what they're talking about most of the time. What they DO KNOW is that the very idea of firearms makes them FEEL bad and, since they are totally ruled by their FEELINGS, it's pretty much hopeless approaching them with logic or the facts. Their force shields against both of those are very, very strong.|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	Those people do not care what drug lords do.  They just don't like to think that people in fly-over country have guns and are not helpless and dependent on the government.  They have a visceral dislike of comfortable, happy Americans.  They are embarrassed by the American values of self sufficiency and rugged individualism.  Guns are a symbol of those values so they are very annoyed by the thought of Americans enjoying gun ownership.  Yes, most middle Americans do not want assault weapens but the people you are talking about believe in incrementalism.  Take away the assault weapon this year and the shot gun next year.|`|spuz7DvNaa	Liberals have been indoctrinated into believeng a ban would take all the guns off the streets but it never will.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is a great commercial about guns and criminals.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w0Pq4QVu0w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w0Pq4QVu...</a>|`|AA12176505	I have no idea, I believe that the trigger finger kills, not the weapon.  What I would really like to know is why you want one?  The only thing they are good for is killing people....|`|K2ecmzInaa	Because people think guns=bad, guns=illegal=not bad. They do not realize that only law abiding citizens follow the law. Banning any sort of weapons would take the weapon out of a law abiding citizen's hands but not stop criminals from still receiving them.<br>  <br>  Also, for future reference, an "assault weapon" is nothing more than a weapon with three or more COSMETIC alterations. It has nothing to do with rate of fire or anything else.|`|Pp51J2WTaa	The thought of disarming the good guys so that only the bad guys have guns is totally stupid.

uh2bkRrFaa	What people don't realize in America is in each state, you can choose your method from whatever the state's legal executions available. Some states have a few like firing squad, lethal injection and hanging. I think one or two states still have the gas chamber but I don't think it's been used for years. I think in CA it's just lethal injection or gas chamber, but I can't remember exactly.  I think a couple states actually still allow the electric chair but who's going to choose that?|`|y299k5j8aa	in the old days they used torture items like the screw! where the strap you down to a table and get a screw and starting screwing it down yea sound gross to me and they also put them in dungeons and never fed them anything.

The administrators stopped being involved in the process a couple of years ago.  Some people will report anything they disagree with.  I personally would rather debate with someone who posts an offensive question and point out why I think he's wrong, but some people report me for that and others report the asker and get both the question and the answers deleted.  That just removes the whole topic and nobody learns anything from it.

The people in charge of these plans are getting the same benefits so their is no reason to stop it.  We all know of the generational welfare families in the 60's and 70's and even 80's  It wasn't till the contract with America in 94 that forced Clonton to pass successfull welfare reform.  As in all societies, the 80 /20 rule applies.  28% of the population make 80% of the production, the problem know is Obama, Harry and Nacny want to destroy the 20%.

So those of us who do pay have to pay more for them, have to wait longer because of them, and suffer because of people who don't want to contribute. Not to mention the countless frivolous lawsuits. If you are working, you can afford healthcare, there are plenty of cheap plans out there. If you want more care or better care, more incentive for you to work harder or stay in school. If you want to have kids but can't afford the health care? WAIT GODDAMIT, DON'T MAKE ME PAY FOR THEM! I pay for mine, how is it fair that I should have to pay for someone elses?

882aadf45b04a15ccacc11c27555a716aa	Jenny, I am a historian on the European holocaust of the 1930's/1940's.  I have also researched the FEMA camps, prisoner railroad cars, guillotines, & coffin controversy.  The coffin issue CAN be easily explained, as they would be needed to prevent disease in case of mass deaths due to any natural or man made disaster such as chemical/biological strikes on American soil.<br>  The so called prisoner railroad cars were found out to be railroad cars for the transportation of vehicles, hence the "shackles" inside them. No verification of guillotines was able to be found during my research on the subject.<br>  The FEMA camps are NOT explainable at this juncture in time.  They remain a HOT topic, tho several "suggestions" have been offered for them.  Even "modern" designed death camps would function in "principal" like the nazi death camps of old, as they were literally "engineering marvels" even by today's standards, FOR their intended use.<br>  Coffins would never be used in a death camp due to disposal problems versus acreage consumed by them.  Death camps due NOT honor their victims by burial, but dispose of corpses by incinerators.  A better understanding of why & how death camps function can be researched by you at the following links...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ar/modern/archreview.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathcamps.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/belzec/rutherford.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathcamps.org/belzec/rutherf...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ar/gersteinreport.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/reinhard/wirth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathcamps.org/reinhard/wirth...</a><br>  <br>  I include links that will give JENNY an idea of death camp, construction, prisoner transport, function & the type of people needed to staff a "toten Kamp".  As you can see from just the links above, death camps in America would certainly be next to impossible to set up let alone operate to intended use, at this CURRENT TIME in history.<br>  Too many Americans are privy to the history of them.  Coupled with INSTANT communication as we possess today the secrecy needed would be impossible to keep about there construction & operation.  I am not saying that there are not Christian Wirth's & Lorenz Hackenholt's within America today.  The "MILGRAM experiment" showed that even typical every day American students could be turned into Wirth's & Hackenholt's.<br>  BUT, that would take a COMPLETE break down of American society as we know it today for that to occur.  I have studied the European holocaust in depth from 1960 through 1996 in search for an answer as to why. I found the answer in 96' by accident & was so bitter regarding the answer that I shut down any further study, vowing to never touch the subject again.<br>  My studies though were EXTENSIVE in depth, maybe to the point of ridiculous.  Those studies tell me today that a repeat of that tragedy in today's America at current would be next to impossible to pull off by a government organization.  If I were you I would concentrate more on the importance of keeping America a SOVEREIGN Constitutionally based republic, as it is the BEST insurance against any future attempt at creating a holocaust in America.|`|m1T2fSnHaa	Sounds like they are preparing for a biological attack in the US- sure why not they are letting in Illegal Aliens like mad and Al Qaeda has been studing for years the Mexican Borders and how to get in America.<br>  <br>  Sorry Liberals you can hug a terrorist all you want- it don't matter!  they want to chop off your h.... anyway- its Allahs orders, they truely believe destruction of America will bring them their 12th prophet.

If he was pulled over for what ever reason, Law inforcement officers are trained especially to seek out the scent of marijuana or any other drug. He can be caught for possession of drugs and do anywhere between 6-9 months in prison not to mention atleast 250 hours of community service here in NJ. As for possession, that goes anywhere in the world! He will get in trouble, if you're his true friend, tell him not to become the drugs version of the pony express|`|vEBfp8yHaa	If he gets caught by the cops with weed on him he can get arrested - it doesn't matter whose it is and if he was smoking it or not - he'll be charged w/ posession.

That's all the law needs to know.  They don't want to know that he selling it "for a friend".  He is the one in possession of the weed and/or the cash.  Or he can popped for purchasing it.

tvNkizDraa	LOL, it's a bit mixed up.  The right says they are for limited, small, unobtrusive government... unless it comes to a woman's right to choose or a homosexual couple's right to marry.  At that point, it's government that's small enough to fit through the keyholes of bedroom doors.  <br>  <br>  Anarchists... now that's a tough one.  From a fiscally conservative perspective, they could be considered right wing extremists.  However, any self-respecting anarchist would be repulsed by the controlling and oppressive aspects of social conservatism.  Interesting how almost all right wing extremists carry the social, not the fiscal, conservatism to an extreme.  Wow, I thought I was disenfranchised by the current two party system, but anarchists are really skrewed!  <sorry>|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Good question.

Can you work?   I doubt Social Security will think you would be needing to work at the age of 63.<br>  I think you will get whatever the rate is at that time of your retirement. Good Luck.|`|wFK2vVyHaa	If you had to change your benefits from disability to retirement, your retirement benefit would be based on your age at the time you become entitled to the retirement benefit.|`|l23ttRePaa	My husband is on disability and has been since he was 46 and now 58. He gets almost $1200.00 monthly and that is not what his Social Security amount would have been. He was told that he would make more on regular SS than on SSD.<br>  <br>  So, you need to check with them if you get anything from them regarding a change in your monthly payments. If that were the case they probably wouldn't contact you until you were at least 66 which is now the retirement age of record.<br>  <br>  I'm quite sure they're not going to drop you but you need to get in touch with them if they do send you anything at all when you become of the required retirement age. I wouldn't do anything at all unless they got in touch with you first. No need to stir up a problem before it arises.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped a little and have a great evening.|`|dBUol8VQaa	If you went on disability at age 54 you will most likely keep your disability. I know one guy that went back to work after being on disability for about 15 years. Social security refused to remove him from the disability roll when he ask them to do so. They stated the reason for not removing him from their roll is because it would be very hard to reinstate him when he needed it again. And they said he WOULD need it again. He did have a very nice paycheck every month, he's gone now but he worked a full time job right up until he died.|`|XPSIn3wxaa	You will not be removed. Stop. If you cannot work, you can not work. Just keep your wages, if you can work part time, under the magic number of $750.00 a month and you will be ok.|`|K2QwEM4raa	You can start drawing at age 62. Go to SSA on the internet.
fAaLjlI0aa	Well, first of all, you accused her, you didn't charge her. You are not in a position to charge her unless you are the DA, and even then it would be a conflict of interest with your daughter involved. <br>  <br>  The DA that is really on the case will decide if there is enough evidence for an actual assault charge, or any charges at all for that matter. If there is, they will file, and it will go before a judge. The girl will get an attorney, either via her parents or the court assigning a PD, and then the DA will most likely offer a plea involving probation and community service, and possibly anger management courses, in the hopes of avoiding a trial. The girl and her attorney will either accept the plea (most likely outcome) or refuse it, and take it to trial. At a trial, both sides would present their evidence and a jury would decide. Likely sentence in the event of a guilty verdict would be pretty much the same as the plea deal, with the possibility of a short stint in juvie or a juvie camp, but that is not likely with a first time offender unless she hit your daughter with a weapon, like a pipe or a brick. <br>  <br>  So, long story short, if she is charged at all, she will likely get probation, community service, restitution, and possible anger management or other counseling.|`|8916e90fdddb48c1a4e829a4efe53aa9aa	What did your daughter do to deserve getting smacked?|`|oyr13KYmaa	She will probably go to a juvenile prison and be abused until she is 18.

EJ8RZF7taa	Hi ma'am I just watched Last Calls for police officers in order to properly respect some fallen police officers somehow. Truly a sad sad call, brought tears to my eyes to be honest. I'm glad the police does these signs of respect that fallen police officers rightly deserve. Hopefully one day I will be able to have the Honor of being acknowledged as a police officer and be able to continue the work of the fallen police officers. As the police officers say "10-42 10-8 we'll take it from here thank you for your service". Thank you to all our public servants. As for you ma'am I would also like to personally thank you for your service. Stay safe. God Bless. Bleed blue

You (ACORN) pay me (people who ACORN hired to register people to vote) a certain fee to paint your house. But, instead of actually painting it, I just take your money and dump the can of paint all over your lawn. Are YOU the one that is perpetrating fraud, or are you the VICTIM of fraud?|`|xSxqKF3Jaa	Yes, ACORN has been found to have committed voter fraud. It is too bad, but I am not going to contest [his presidency] it like the Democrats did after Bush won. It's too bad that the Democrats couldn't let Bush be President because they were so bitter. And yet they think the Republicans should help them pass his bills. You get what you ask for.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	Nothing...the investigation into Acorn and voter fraud magically disappeared the minute Obama was elected and most of the offices just disappeared along with their computers and paper work.

AA11454606	The idea to put deadbeat parents in jail for not paying child support is the dumbest idea the states have ever come up with. There is no way you are going to get money from someone who does not want to pay it. Especially if you take away their ability to earn.<br>  Washington is notorious for this BS. The second dumbest idea is taking visitation away from a parent that does not pay. This only penalizes the child.<br>  And, to be clear, he owed YOU nothing, he owed the child. <br>  It is best that the custodial parent moves on and cares for the children the best they can.|`|AA10780838	No, just Jail|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	I believe that peopel who REFUSE to pay should go to jail, one time cahnce to catch upm the off they go.<br>  <br>  When tey attached delinqunt child support to passports, the amount of arrears collected was incredible........|`|85jy4Mt0aa	If a person does not have the ability to pay, that person should not be jailed for nonpayment.<br>  <br>  If a person who has the ability to pay child support and does not, that person should be jailed if all other remedies have been exhausted (garnishment, tax refund diversion, other collection techniques).<br>  <br>  Part of my graduate studies involved research on this subject.  I found that jaililng a nonpayer does not usually make that person a better payer, but jailing nonpayers regularly is strongly related to increasing the rate of payment in that community.  In other words, the jailed deadbeat serves as a bad example and encourages others to pay more regularly.<br>  <br>  The focus should always be: What is best for the child?  Usually, but not always, it is best for the child to be supported by both parents.

In my experience, law professors want you to read the assigned cases, and learn to analyze it their way.  Some of the people who had the most difficulty in their first year were those that already knew something about the law (or so they thought).  I would advise against getting a little bit of knowledge that may or may not conflict with what you'll lean in school.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Cases.  Lots and lots of cases, mostly from the federal appellate and Supreme courts but also from state appellate and supreme courts.  I don't know that there's anything you can read to prepare, really.

Q6euzOmVaa	both parties are idiots and pinheads. However, the current group is so over the top in spending that it will destroy this economy! There is no way that they can pay for all this sh*t without raising taxes and that is the last thing we need in a recession!|`|AA11702773	My thought is that Bush spending too much was terrible and the way to fix that is not to race us even faster towards bankruptcy but to correct it by cutting spending and cutting debt.<br>  <br>  There are many other 'ballgames', Obama and the Dems are just saying they want their 'turn' to run up our credit cards after the neocon GOP (NOT the conservative GOP) totally spent our assets.  One on top of the other is a disaster for US and for the country, however much fun the politicians may have or have had spending our money as if we had any to spare.<br>  <br>  He is destroying the currency, and what is left of our economy.  He is turning a recession into a depression just as FDR did.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	I'm still trying to figure out why the Democrats didn't do anything.<br>  But they were in the minority and still got fillibustered and vetoed even the last 2 years so they couldn't do anything.<br>  But Bush had them against the wall with that "If you don't vote for these spending bills you are unpatriotic" because of 911 BS.<br>  Very sad - and we will pay the price for A VERY LONG TIME!!!|`|13db40225fc025aff3b81b2609fc6918aa	I don't care who is in office, spending your way out of a recession will not work.

All this was done while turning a budget surplus into a $1T deficit.<br>  <br>  Our infrastructure is broken, our factories shut done, our business boarded up, our Army broken, our people unemployed, hungry, & on the streets, and our homes foreclosed. Our American Values have been abandoned, our image & moral authority trashed. And worse, no plans, intentions, or investments to build up America to meet tomorrow & compete globally were put in place. At least Obama’s approach will leave us with residual value that will serve our country & people for years.<br>  <br>  Now these same folks push to continue their Tax Cut party for the rich, doubling down on busted policies, while squirming for cover under a ‘mythical’ past Republican administration that has ‘disappeared’. Remember, our current Republican Congress ARE the ones that got us into this mess – the current members generated the legislation & authorized the spending, the shift of wealth to the top, provided (or not) the oversight, & led the Tax Cut party that raped our country – Bush just signed the legislation. And these are the same guys who will not even help their own states – how bad will they leave us and the country lying in the dirt?<br>  <br>  This is not whom I turn to for Financial Advice or for directing the country. These Republicans need to get on board or get out of the way – obstructionism at this point in American’s history serves neither our Country nor her citizens. Nor does it do anything to remove the stench from a spoiled  political brand.

Most cite examples of much smaller countries (Canada 33,224,000, France 64,473,140). Many of those that are having their own problems currently:<br>  <br>  - UK is now in favor of denying overweight people & smokers because of high costs (how would that go over in the land of the obese people?<br>  <br>  - Like every other nation, France is wrestling with runaway health-care inflation. That has led to some hefty tax hikes, and France is now considering U.S.-style health-maintenance organization tactics to rein in costs.<br>  <br>  - 57% of Canadians reported waiting 4 weeks or more to see a specialist; 24% of Canadians waited 4 hours or more in the emergency room.<br>  <br>  - Saskatchewan is under fire for having the longest waiting time in the country for a diagnostic MRI " a whopping 22 months.|`|IUw5Z395aa	Because Republicans and their representatives are RETARDED; their the reason the U.S. is falling behind in everything from life expectancy to education|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	Why?

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	These are the North Caroline statutes (laws) on divorce:<br>  <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/Statutes/StatutesTOC.pl?Chapter=0050" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/St...</a><br>  <br>  By the way, you can sue him for divorce on the grounds of adultery (his conviction for sexual assault of your children should qualify). Or his sexual assault of them could qualify for, "Offers such indignities to the person of the other as to render his or her condition intolerable and life burdensome."   Check out this subsection: <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_50-7.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegis...</a><br>  <br>  Also, although you can file for divorce in North Carolina after a one year separation without ground, there doesn't appear to be a one year restriction if there are grounds.  Who told you that you have to wait?

I seriously would look into that possibility, rather than an attorney.

You would prepare divorce papers, file them at the courthouse and serve them to your spouse in prison.<br>  You do not need a lawyer unless its contested. I would serve him the papers and see if he signs them. Unfortunately, he still has the right to contest the divorce, although I'm not sure you'd even need a lawyer even if he contested...I don't know many judges that would allow him much leeway in contesting a divorce after what he did.<br>  This link might help, its what I used: <a href="http://document-do-it-yourself-service.com/faqs.html#prison" rel="nofollow">http://document-do-it-yourself-service.c...</a>|`|EQr7BtJlaa	file for (abandonment) in your county clerk of court, you can get a divorce quicker with not much resistance from him
eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Tell the cops first and give them the cell phone pictures.  What was done to your best friend is a crime and this person who sent the pictures is also harassing her.  Secondly, she needs to tell her parents what was done to her and the school has to be notified as she has been bullied at school (by the person who told the whole school what was going on).  Thirdly, a restraining order may have to be filed against her harassers to keep her from annoying her any further.<br>  <br>  Finally, she is too young for a cell phone.  I am sorry this happened to her but she isn't mature enough for the responsibility of a cell phone and she is unable to protect herself from predators.  None of you have executed good judgment and now it is time to let the authorities take over.<br>  <br>  Please don't wait...tell a grown-up now...today!|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Tell your parents about it.

Lawyers involved in criminal cases can be prosecutors, public defenders or private.  Private lawyers do not get a salary, they get fees that they negotiate with individual clients.  Some make chump change and some make millions.  Prosecutors and public defenders as a rule do not start out taking murder cases.  They start out on misdemeanors.  If you want to know the starting salary for prosecutors and public defenders, call the agency in your county and ask.|`|xjcZkmpbaa	It will depend on which side you represent, among other things.  If you plan to prosecute homicides, you'll start out in the District Attorney's office as a lawyer, but probably won't be involved in a homicide prosecution for many years.  If you intend to be a defense attorney, defending people charged with some form of homicide, you'd probably start in the Public Defender's office just to get some experience.  Again, though, you'd probably have to be there for awhile before you got involved with such a serious case.  New attorneys working for either the DA or the Public Defender's office make much money.  It's more about gaining some experience.  Good luck with your project, I hope this helps.|`|3ZSsBYtnaa	BIG BUCKS

They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!

RCpkdx4haa	Psychiatrists will turn you in for sure. Their confidentiality is limited. When they know of a crime or know a crime will be committed, they are obligated by law to contact authorities. Lawyers will not even ask you. They aren't interested in whether you committed the crime or not, plus it's illegal for them to know that you are guilty and still try to get you off. It's perjury, lying in court while you are under oath to tell the truth. They will ask you questions regarding where you were at the time, what you were doing, who you were with; but if anything steers them in the direction of learning the truth, they will cut off that path and go back to basics.|`|of049X1waa	pyschiatrists, do not tell them!  they will have to report you.  A lawyer, you should probably lie as well, although a lawyer won't always turn you in, but they might.|`|O6x1CTd4aa	I don't know the answer to the first part of your question but on the second part, if you tell a psychiatrist of a crime you committed or plan on committing they are obligated by law to report it. It is one of the very few times they are allowed to break confidentiality outside of a court order.|`|8LhEs3WLaa	Both your Lawyer and psych are bound by confidentiality laws. If I murdered someone though I wouldn't just blurt it out to my Lawyer as they are only human and may not argue for you to the best of their ability if you have admitted you are guilty. as for your psych, yes I would tell them as they are the ones who can help you overcome your sickness. (Most murderers obviously have some sort of sickness). the point is they are bound by confidentiality laws and can lose their licenses if they break such laws. Hypothetically of course.|`|4LbCkFCBaa	Your theory of the case can be whatever you want. I shut people down when they start telling me things  I don't want to know.<br>  <br>  If your legal story is one way and then you change it, the lawyer will not put you on the stand, b/c you have changed your story and you may be lying no matter what story you tell.  <br>  <br>  However if you never change your story, then that theory can be put forward.  Follow? <br>  <br>  For example if your defense is that you weren't on the planet that day, the lawyer can put forth that theory.  But if it is one theory one day and another the next then neither can be put forward. <br>  <br>  Best bet is to invoke your right to remain silent.  The lawyer will ask you the questions they want answered. <br>  <br>  When someone wants to tell tales then the lawyer will probably ethically be obligated to withdraw as counsel. <br>  <br>  Not sure about shrinks.  If it is the same as a lawyer then the only mandatory reporting is when someone's life is in future jeopardy.
OiAl6w48aa	The Supreme Court just ruled that domestic violence - even if a misdemeanor - precludes you from having a gun.  The case is U.S. v. Hayes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Conan - the US v. Hayes case is based on federal law.  It trumps ALL state and local rules, laws and regulations on the issue of gun ownership by persons convicted of domestic violence.  There is no solution available once convicted - the federal law is a clear ban.  The case was just decided in the past few weeks, so I suggest you read the opinion.  Link below.|`|4LbCkFCBaa	Check with the prosecutors office who handled the case.  As the earlier post mentioned and you are already aware, domestic violence (in my state) does limit some things.  <br>  <br>  The prosecutor's office will have the final say in front of a judge IMO. <br>  <br>  If there is a solution that office will be part of it.  They wil also have access to your criminal records and be able to make an informed decision.
eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Unless you are legally emancipated, you cannot move out of your parents' home without their permission.  And as they would be financially responsible for you, I doubt they would give said permission.  And if you do leave without their permission and/or a court order, they are within their rights to contact the police and have you retrieved, even brought back in handcuffs, if necessary.  Would you like that?<br>  <br>  They have other rights too...like the right to put you in a military school or boot/wilderness camp until you are 18...and you have no say over it.  They can also drag you before a judge and say that you refuse to obey their lawful authority.  The judge can then put you in a foster home, treatment facility, hospital, detention center, or even a jail until you reach the age of 18 if he deems you need supervision.<br>  <br>  It is just best to obey your parents until you turn 18 and can legally leave...or see if you can get emancipated.  To break the law will just bring you nothing but trouble!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	A child can be emancipated at different ages in different states. Basically, once you are emancipated, it means you are on your own, your parents are no longer legally responsible for you, they don't have to let you come back or take care of you.<br>  <br>  Again, in most states, the age of 18 makes you an adult, until then, you live where your parents want you to live.

PzSI7EPEaa	It's not even an Indian film, it's a British film based on an Indian novel that is set in India. As a movie too it is overrated frankly. I don't see why it deserves 8 oscars.

Why should you go to jail for 10 years when your young and miss out on schooling and everything that you need for the rest of your life? I guess if they are under 18 and commit murder or rape I would have them be considered an adult since those are very serious crimes and that can't be considered just stupid teenager stuff.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Which ones, exactly?  Minors already have basically no rights.  Except in the most extreme circumstances, their legal guardian is entirely responsible for them and their actions.  Or are you referring to the extent to which the law can punish a minor, which I agree is relatively lax?
spbqfjvbaa	I believe so.  If family can attend the seremony, then accompanied children should be able to attend, too.

So the next time you cross the border, you will show up to be wanted by Quebec police. That won't look good and can get you denied access to Canada in the future. Just avoid any complications now over a stupid speeding ticket, pay the damn fine.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	No it won't go on your record, no they won't stop you at the border, but if you get pulled over again in Queerbec then they will make you pay it.
AA12090960	right it depends. I'm no expert on the law it self but I used to work for a council agency for their traffic operations and had to know about its certain penalty charges but that was one where photographic evidence was obviously needed otherwise there is no case to penalise.<br>  <br>  However when it comes to parking My understanding is that if you received the ticket on the spot i.e the warden slapped one on your windscreen then really I think there's no need for photographic evidence as that is hard evidence itself.<br>  <br>  However if it was sent to you by post as you did not get one slapped on your windscreen then they ideally would need to provide evidence of how they knew you were parked there. Its no good IMHO to say you were there that's that.<br>  <br>  So if your saying you did not get a ticket on the spot and it came through the post then I would suggest to call their bluff and ask them for evidence.<br>  <br>  Like always use the bonus of the time limits they give. I shall believe you got in your first representation within the first 14 day period. on their reply, if I can remember the procedure correctly you get your 28 day period back. Again get your second letter to them before the first 14 days as this means that if the fine has to be paid it will be at the lower rate. if your letter gets to them after the first 14 days, if you have to pay, then your liable to pay the full whack.<br>  <br>  if there is no success on your second representation, and they too have no evidence to support that they know you were there (remember, getting a ticket on the spot is solid evidence so you need to dis-count that) and also they have given you their final verdict, then they should also advise you at this stage that if your not happy then you must make an appeal to the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service, otherwise you must make your payment.<br>  <br>  What you can then do is make an appeal to PATAS (we used joke about this - PAT - AS[S] lol how immature of us lot!) and make sure again its done within the 14 day period as these authorities are at least efficient at keeping up with penalty deadlines and they can penalise you and fine you the full whack. PATAS (hehehee sorry) will look at the case and will either inform the authority to cancel the charge as your case is valid or they will reject the case itself on the grounds that its not valid. In which case your back to square 1.<br>  <br>  but if you got the time and know how then why not pursue the case and let it run as far as you can possibly take it the worst is there will be a final verdict saying no we're right your wrong. and if your careful, you'll only have lost out really on the postage that you pay unless you miss your 14 day period then like i said above you'll have to pay double.<br>  <br>  Good luck anyway, hope I've been of assistance.|`|85vDqn6naa	what have you got to lose, seems to me they should have proof to charge you|`|fox5a3ePaa	I dont know but if they put the debt into the hands of the balifs you will end up with a bill for several hundred pounds|`|iRg1vyHcaa	I'll try and keep it brief.<br>  <br>  You have suggested by saying that you 'called their bluff' that you were actually parked there. In that case you have committed the offence and should pay the fine. I don't understand what grounds you have to contest it. They do not need photographic evidence at all. The enforcement officer has taken your car details and will provide a statement so you have been caught bang to rights.<br>  <br>  You've compared this to World War 2 of all things. The difference is that you have broken the law while the Jews were innocent.<br>  <br>  My guess would be that if you contest it on your own you will lose and the fine will be doubled at least if not tripled or quadrupled. Your only hope is coming up with some reason why the parking signs or road markings are not legal and therefore not enforcable. If they are legal then you're knackered!!|`|cb130445dd2cd6218eb93c5ce76da0efaa	Had a parking fine recently  when it snowed( 1st & last i hope) & the car was lifted & taken away by the council at a cost of 140 quid to get it back! They supplied  photographic eveidence but one of their photos showed that the yellow lines that I had parked on were not visible because of the snow....I appealed & they refunded the money....so they obviously rely on such evidence to 'prove' their point.Also know a few people who have had tickets for parking 'outside the painted boxes' not completely outside, just with one or two wheels over the lines ....no phot's to prove anything & they were still fined. So its worth a go..... if it went to court it would be their word against yours and without photo's they cant prove their point, but neither can you...so its a bit of a tricky situation|`|t3yZtPVRaa	do you see traffic wardens with cameras. no, just pay up, you'll cost yourself a lot more by argueing a lost cause|`|psMZrXa7aa	I am unsure of what the law states on this matter, but there is something else you can try.<br>  Find out the name of the 'company' that issued the ticket, go online and see if they are 'licensed and registered' to issue tickets where you received it. <br>  If they are not, then they don't have a leg to stand on.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	No they do not need photographic evidence, however a well drafted letter contesting the charge may get you out of it. Evidently they didn't think your letter was up to the job so they have called your bluff, I suggest you pay up before this gets out of hand.

Through no fault but my own, I racked up over $30,000 in debt while making just over $40,000 per year.<br>  <br>  It took me six years to work myself out of that debt.  I did not ask for handouts from others.  I did not demand that my employer pay me more or cover more of my expenses.  I certainly was't stupid enough to maintain my previous spending habits while taking out loans.<br>  <br>  I sacrificed. I changed my lifestyle.  I was the only one of my friends who did not have a cell phone, internet and premium cable, and I did not care....paying down that crippling, suffocating debt was my only priority.  <br>  <br>  I would have loved to buy a new, fuel-efficient car or moved to an apartment with better insulation...but those things took a back seat to the debt.  So instead, I controlled my fuel usage and wore sweats at home.<br>  <br>  The only way a nation can control it's debt, whatever the figure, is to actually make it a priority...and not a slogan...and to accept the sacrifices that come with it.

ffRTnoEyaa	San Fran/Berkley|`|y9vqyqeNaa	San Francisco EASILY takes the cake. In fact, they are arguably the most corrupt city in America.<br>  <br>  In 1868, a major earthquake struck San Francisco. A team of local scientists then discovered the San Andreas fault running through SF and the Hayward fault on the Oakland side of the bay. A local businessman received the report and destroyed it because he feared that this earthquake info would destroy the area's skyrocketing growth.<br>  <br>  So people had no idea what a ticking time bomb the place was. <br>  <br>  Then around 1900, SF fire chief Dennis Sullivan proposed a state of the art water pumping system, independent of the city's water supply, to be used for emergencies (like, say, an earthquake). Sullivan was laughed out of City Hall. Then came 1906 and the earthquake destroyed everything. Sullivan died in the disaster.<br>  <br>  Even then, powerful interests referred to the disaster as the Great San Francisco Fire, as if the earthquake had never happened. Local politicians claimed that only 500 people had died in an attempt to minimize the effects of the quake (it is believed that 3,000 people died). <br>  <br>  When the city was completely rebuilt in 1915, a world fair was held in San Francisco to celebrate the city's rebirth. The exposition grounds were demolished after the fair and the Marina District was built on the very same landfill that had been reclaimed from the bay. The result was that in 1989, the district was obliterated by the Loma Prieta quake.<br>  <br>  Now, the city is notorious for harboring illegal aliens and refusing to deport them, even when they have committed vicious crimes. It is also the only city in America that would actually use taxpayer dollars to pay for gay illegal alien weddings.<br>  <br>  There is a not-so-brief history of San Francisco for you.

TYGgRjqDaa	I'm not a big advocate of touching your beloved guns, but I'm not sure I see the need for an assault rifle.  Protection?  If so, is that the only gun that could stop someone coming at you?  <br>  <br>  I really don't know anything about guns.  I know I want the armor piercing type bullets taken away for the safety of our police, but that's pretty much the extent of my opinion.

A 21st century nut-job can spray a classroom with 50 rounds in about 3 seconds, reload in another 10 seconds, and move on to repeat the process.<br>  <br>  So yeah, we can, should and will maintain our right to bear arms, but that doesn't mean we can't try to respect that right while at the same time trying to maximize public safety.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	Because the reality is, what don't they want to control (some, not all Democrats)?<br>  <br>  As for restrictions on any type of weapon, until the Government can guaranty that no criminal is better armed than me, I would like to keep my options open.<br>  <br>  Assault weapons are the gun control advocates "boogie man", but the truth is crimes are committed by people with hand guns, and illegal ones at that.  Maybe their time would be better spent outlawing CRIMINALS.  But for some reason they seem to love the criminal, but hate guns.  I guess it's because guns can't vote.

teKeLxX2aa	The same thing goes for all imperialistic initiatives in the modern age. It used to be that you could simply call it imperialism, but now that we live in a politically correct society the media has to phrase it differently so citizens don't object to it.<br>  <br>  When the French took control of Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam) they claimed that they were doing it in the best interest of the natives, because they would be spreading knowledge and technology. What they ended up doing was raping southeast Asia of its resources, and taking what little commodities and social advances people had, away from them. Before the French came, a majority of Vietnamese were attending school and were literate. In a matter of decades, only the wealthiest Vietnamese collaborators could attend a learning institution, and a very small percentage was literate.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, it isn't about right or wrong. Its about money, power, and the ability to influence worldwide events for personal gain. Most people are brought up through television and movies to believe that good or bad are the underlying motives of all heroes and villains. When in actuality, those who are taught 'the ends justify the means' without any ambiguous moral bias, are the ones who really rule the world.|`|j38mlGvZaa	I have pondered this myself. It's very ironic but if we want to protect our freedom, many believe that we have to make sure everyone else in the world defines the word the same way we do.

The idea is short lived in Your mind but, the rich are like cream they come to the top and so you can not keep them down. It is the American spirit. When you bomb us we stand up and crush you?  When we have citizens in need we come to their aid?  It is just a way to keep the poor in our society without money they can not understand how to use anyways.<br>  People have to realize that we need government and infrastructure and it cost so, the people that stand to benefit the most should pay the most and if you earn a butt load of money pay the extra 12% above to cover the money the poor should be paying if we gave them any. Remember they can not handle money so the rich have to do it that is how they got rich.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	I dont think it will even generate the one year bump. Quite a few people I know have already shifted their portfolio's to stocks in non-taxable accounts, and only T bills and munis in taxable accounts.

The roll backs do not occur until 2011 when the U.S. should once again be returning to economic normalcy.  Those making $250,000 will be the ones affected, and every taxpayer will receive cuts beginning in the spring of 2009.

Perhaps the people who want to raise those taxes desire an economic collapse.  The devil may be evil, but he isn't stupid.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	Was it not FDR, that told the rich(very) to put money back into circulation, or he would strike new currency?|`|TJtifnxPaa	No, I do not. They didn't ask my opinion. And I'm pissed.|`|fPMVuB87aa	no sir it is not.|`|pi5WKPNwaa	I have heard this question a lot over the last few weeks.  I answer with a question. Have you or anyone you know ever received a position from someone that is poor?  If the rich are taxed more there will be less employment, fewer business's starting, and more company's going overseas.  Also the rich are going to pass that tax increase to the middle and lower class.  They will start saving their money so they can stay rich. It is also likely they will start charging more for their goods and services to make up for this raise in tax. History as shown us that raising taxes in a recession will do nothing but extend the time it take the economy to recover.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I don't think it did diddly to keep it from happening, all we seem to have done is lost money.<br>  There is a difference between personal income taxes going up and corporate taxes that would influence business.<br>  Jobs will continue to be lost for some time to come, that's a result of no one lending and no one buying.  That's what happens in a recession.<br>  I'm not 100% happy with this direction, but I don't see any viable alternative being offered by the Republicans, except tax cuts, which will not help anything and have already proven their uselessness at keeping the economy going.|`|QZicQ0kuaa	Socialism is already here and the Liberals actually believe the government is better at controlling Capital than business. We are done. All those politicians are millionaires and are out of touch. They think it's fine that the rest of us should make the same amount no matter how much time we put in.<br>  <br>  Why did Democrats raise Capital Gains taxes despite evidence that doing so actually results in less revenue for the Fed? To punish "the rich" and make it "fair". Nice plan. Discourage investment. Everyone faces capital Gains taxes in life not just the rich. That's a bunch of coddling rhetoric.|`|AA11942937	no, but obamabots are still thinking the increase is just for those mean old 'rich folks'<br>  <br>  When they start to realize the leap in inflation due to increased costs to the company and their suppliers, then it will be 'bush's fault'......same old reason.  <br>  <br>  As long as they get their extra $13 a week they are getting a tax cut.......whoo hoo!<br>  <br>  for David M........"their fair share" is going to be covered by increased cost to you.  YOU will be the one paying the increase.  Companies aren't in business to lose money and most owners and upper management are your 'wealthy' people.  They pass increases on to the consumer.  Need an example?  What happened to the cost of groceries when gas prices and therefore transportation cost jumped up?  You paid, buddy.  No matter how you want to slice it, you paid the increase.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Can't you hear?  Only the "wealthy" will be taxed, everyone else gets a tax break.  How in the world could that equate to job loss?  Everybody will just have more money to spend in the economy because of the tax breaks.  The rich people can afford it.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I wouldn't even try if I were you.  It's way beyond comprehension to most.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  The bigger question is this.People are losing their jobs and houses, now ole dumbo ears and ole botox face pelosi decide to raise taxes, where the hell is this money coming from.

9c9f03d21433f9d0bbceda1d06c5e64caa	There are a lot of MOS-T's at Ft. Huachuca. 35F is a horribly boring course, literally death by powerpoint. But if you love tedious military map reading, symbology, and making educated guesses, it may be the MOS for you. As a MOS-T, you will live in Riley Barracks, 2-man rooms, and take your POV here. You will have off-post privileges from the day you get here and enjoy free time after duty hours (after about 1700). You will attend class with IET soldiers, who will be the majority, and will have general authority over them but cannot drop them.<br>  <br>  The course has a relatively high failure rate and lots of IET soldiers end up getting recycled/T-spaced/chaptered. Like I said, it's boring as hell. Very, very dry material in a windowless classroom with those nasty artificial white lights and boring instructors who just read off powerpoints and don't know how to explain stuff. Also, it's a tactical course (find, locate, destroy the enemy) so don't expect anything strategic.<br>  <br>  Any more ? just ask.
gasquENMaa	Probation is an agreement between you and the court in place of serving your time in jail. You will be given a set of rules ( called sanctions) to follow. <br>  <br>  Each case can and will be tailored to suit the individual, but certain sanctions are considered standard. Among them is:<br>  <br>  Maintain steady employment, Report when ordered. Do not associate with persons on probation or parole. Do not break any laws and report any police contact immediately. Do not use drugs or alcohol while on probation. <br>  <br>  Regardless of the reason you might be placed on probation, drug and alcohol testing by urine analysis is standard. It shows that you are following the rules given to you and is a form of self rehabilitation. <br>  <br>  You will not be tested at court. That is not part of the legal system prior to a conviction. However, you will be tested at your first probationary meeting to establish your baseline and random testing after that.<br>  <br>  The THC in cannabis is stored within the fat cells of the body and can take up to 28 days to filter out. I suggest total abstinence until off paper. <br>  <br>  It is a VERY small price to pay rather than sitting in a jail cell staring at the walls. <br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Probation does generally require random drug tests so stop taking drugs now.

hTFalwX6aa	I saw this on another question and LOVED IT!<br>  <br>  Shortly after class, an economics student approaches his economics <br>  professor and says, <br>  <br>  "I don't understand this stimulus bill. Can you explain it to me?" <br>  <br>  The professor replied, "I don't have any time to explain it at my office, <br>  but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend <br>  project, I'll be glad to explain it to you." The student agreed. <br>  <br>  At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor's house. <br>  The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool. <br>  <br>  <br>  They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student <br>  a bucket. Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, "First, <br>  go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you <br>  can." The student did as he was instructed. <br>  <br>  The professor then continued, "Follow me over to the shallow end, and <br>  then dump all the water from your bucket into it." The student was <br>  naturally confused, but did as he was told. <br>  <br>  The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, <br>  and began walking back to the deep end of the pool. <br>  <br>  The confused student asked, "Excuse me, but why are we doing this?" <br>  <br>  The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the <br>  shallow end much deeper. <br>  <br>  The student didn't think the economics professor was serious, but figured <br>  that he would find out the real story soon enough. <br>  <br>  However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the <br>  student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone <br>  mad. The student finally replied, "All we're doing is wasting valuable <br>  time and effort on unproductive pursuits. Even worse, when this process <br>  is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all <br>  you'll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have <br>  been truly productive action!" <br>  <br>  The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, <br>  "Congratulations.

To pay for it we will either have to print more money or borrow more treasury bonds from China. This causes inflation and/or dependency, depending on which route is taken (or both).

He also said that they want to ban cop killer bullets, and close the so called gun show loophole.<br>  <br>  I find this almost amusing.  The original assault weapon ban was never shown to have any positive effect on crime so what's the point other than more governmental control?  Also the anti-gun crowed argued before the SCOTUS that 2A applied only to military service but then they scream you can't have military guns.<br>  <br>  Cop killer bullets is another funny joke.  The ammunition normally referred to was designed by a police officer and an engineer.  They have only been sold to law enforcement and no law enforcement officer has ever died because of such around.  I suspect that they say that any bullet capable of penetrating soft body armor will qualify as cop killer bullets.

And depending on which Constitutional expert you talk to, that either is or is not Constitutional.<br>  <br>  The Second Amendment is about setting limitations on the Federal government's ability to control what a state decides.

People come up to me and start speaking Spanish, so I guess I look more like a Latina than a Swede. I was raised by an all white family (because of adoption), so I'll answer. (I hope that's ok.)<br>  <br>  Answer for 1,2, and 3: it doesn't really matter what their skin color is. They're defined as Republican, Democrat, or as another party based upon what political and economic ideologies they support. A Republican of any nationality or race generally doesn't like the idea of big government and too much government spending. That's why they freak out over the stimulus plan.  Also, they're more likely to oppose extreme regulation of business or nationalization of businesses.  Many don't agree that a nationalized health care system would solve the health care crisis. <br>  <br>  I'm not quite sure why you think everything has to do with skin color or race in our country. The only people I've had problems with are those who are extremely racist. My roommate was a white supremacist my first year of college. It was hell.  That's the exception though, not the rule. Maybe I've missed out on a lot of the overt racism because I was raised by an all white family.

I'm still hoping to be wrong but the evidence, thus far,  speaks for itself.<br>  <br>  You racist blacks will not even recognize the blacks like Condoleeza Rice, Bill Crosby, Michael Steele, to name just a few.

Obama was voted in by some because of the motive to elect a first black president. I voted against Barack Obama not because of race but because of his agenda. If people are voting because of race than I feel that is reckless and losing focus on the real issues.I persoanly feel frusrations concerning the race issue there is still these ripples from an ugly period in our history. Horrific atrocities I wished we could move on and just co-exist.Racism is ugly but on the other hand race issues if unchecked lead to racist additudes.

Our elderly who have no other means of support can receive a monthly check, food stamps, and medicare if they are below the poverty level. Our disabled and our injured Veterans receive support.

Then there`s the bunch of Obama`s cabinet nominees not paying taxes; on the other hand I may join them since I don`t approve of what Obama`s government is doing with my tax money. Rahm Emanuel smiling while stating that they (the Democrats) will take advantage of the "economic crisis" bill and will try to attach as many programs that they have been having trouble with in past legislations. To top it of, there`s Eric Holder with his open challenge to the 2nd Ammendment of the US Constitution, calling American cowards and racists amongst other things. Now he claims that getting rid of some "assault" weapons is going to "reassure" the Mexican govenment that the US is not supplying the Mexican drug cartels with weapons. Doesn`t Mr. Holder know that Mexican drug cartels have been getting their weapons from South America for years now? and where in our Constitution does it say that it can be modified and altered in oder to "reassure" the government of other countries, as Mr. Holder claims he wants to do. The other night during Obama`s speech we get once again a good long view of Nancy Pelosi`s smiling face, she jumps up clapping every 3minutes, then she sits and blinks, and smiles and seems for a few seconds to nod-off, then she jumps up again, clapping, smiling and on the cycle went through Obama`s speech. So I just think, what is going on?|`|C3gaC24Iaa	Did Obama ever STOP using crack?<br>  Look at his Middle East plans.<br>  How about blaming Pres.Bush for the deficit that HE helped to create, while telling us how miraculously his pork-bucket spending spree on future credit is going to get us out of this recession?<br>  How about not understanding the basic, very dangerous differences between a terrorist, captured in battle, and a common criminal, captured by police?

6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	HOPE THIS HELPS:<br>  <br>  The policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission that became known as the "Fairness Doctrine" is an attempt to ensure that all coverage of controversial issues by a broadcast station be balanced and fair. The FCC took the view, in 1949, that station licensees were "public trustees," and as such had an obligation to afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of contrasting points of view on controversial issues of public importance. The Commission later held that stations were also obligated to actively seek out issues of importance to their community and air programming that addressed those issues. With the deregulation sweep of the Reagan Administration during the 1980s, the Commission dissolved the fairness doctrine.<br>  <br>  This doctrine grew out of concern that because of the large number of applications for radio station being submitted and the limited number of frequencies available, broadcasters should make sure they did not use their stations simply as advocates with a singular perspective. Rather, they must allow all points of view. That requirement was to be enforced by FCC mandate.<br>  <br>  From the early 1940s, the FCC had established the "Mayflower Doctrine," which prohibited editorializing by stations. But that absolute ban softened somewhat by the end of the decade, allowing editorializing only if other points of view were aired, balancing that of the station's. During these years, the FCC had established dicta and case law guiding the operation of the doctrine.<br>  <br>  In ensuing years the FCC ensured that the doctrine was operational by laying out rules defining such matters as personal attack and political editorializing (1967). In 1971 the Commission set requirements for the stations to report, with their license renewal, efforts to seek out and address issues of concern to the community. This process became known as "Ascertainment of Community Needs," and was to be done systematically and by the station management.<br>  <br>  The fairness doctrine ran parallel to Section 315 of the Communications Act of 1937 which required stations to offer "equal opportunity" to all legally qualified political candidates for any office if they had allowed any person running in that office to use the station. The attempt was to balance--to force an even handedness. Section 315 exempted news programs, interviews and documentaries. But the doctrine would include such efforts. Another major difference should be noted here: Section 315 was federal law, passed by Congress. The fairness doctrine was simply FCC policy.<br>  <br>  The FCC fairness policy was given great credence by the 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case of Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. FCC. In that case, a station in Pennsylvania, licensed by Red Lion Co., had aired a "Christian Crusade" program wherein an author, Fred J. Cook, was attacked. When Cook requested time to reply in keeping with the fairness doctrine, the station refused. Upon appeal to the FCC, the Commission declared that there was personal attack and the station had failed to meet its obligation. The station appealed and the case wended its way through the courts and eventually to the Supreme Court. The court ruled for the FCC, giving sanction to the fairness doctrine.<br>  <br>  The doctrine, nevertheless, disturbed many journalists, who considered it a violation of First Amendment rights of free speech/free press which should allow reporters to make their own decisions about balancing stories. Fairness, in this view, should not be forced by the FCC. In order to avoid the requirement to go out and find contrasting viewpoints on every issue raised in a story, some journalists simply avoided any coverage of some controversial issues. This "chilling effect" was just the opposite of what the FCC intended.<br>  <br>  By the 1980s, many things had changed. The "scarcity" argument which dictated the "public trustee" philosophy of the Commission, was disappearing with the abundant number of channels available on cable TV. Without scarcity, or with many other voices in the marketplace of ideas, there were perhaps fewer compelling reasons to keep the fairness doctrine. This was also the era of deregulation when the FCC took on a different attitude about its many rules, seen as an unnecessary burden by most stations. The new Chairman of the FCC, Mark Fowler, appointed by President Reagan, publicly avowed to kill to fairness doctrine.<br>  <br>  By 1985, the FCC issued its Fairness Report, asserting that the doctrine was no longer having its intended effect, might actually have a "chilling effect" and might be in violation of the First Amendment. In a 1987 case, Meredith Corp. v. FCC, the courts declared that the doctrine was not mandated by Congress and the FCC did not have to continue to enforce it. The FCC dissolved the doctrine in August of that year.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, before the Commission's action, in the spring of 1987, both houses of Congress voted to put the fairness doctrine into law--a statutory fairness doctrine which the FCC would have to enforce, like it or not. But President Reagan, in keeping with his deregulatory efforts and his long-standing favor of keeping government out of the affairs of business, vetoed the legislation. There were insufficient votes to override the veto. Congressional efforts to make the doctrine into law surfaced again during the Bush administration. As before, the legislation was vetoed, this time by Bush.<br>  <br>  The fairness doctrine remains just beneath the surface of concerns over broadcasting and cablecasting, and some members of congress continue to threaten to pass it into legislation. Currently, however, there is no required balance of controversial issues as mandated by the fairness doctrine. The public relies instead on the judgment of broadcast journalists and its own reasoning ability to sort out one-sided or distorted coverage of an issue. Indeed, experience over the past several years since the demise of the doctrine shows that broadcasters can and do provide substantial coverage of controversial issues of public importance in their communities, including contrasting viewpoints, through news, public affairs, public service, interactive and special programming.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	The liberals invented the fairness doctrine to get rid of Rush Limbaugh?

It won't take long to read it.  <br>  <br>  It says that tv or radio stations have to allow equal amounts of time for opposing viewpoints on any controversial issue.  Meaning that for every 3 hours Rush Limbaugh is on the air, they MUST put Al Franken or some other loser on the air for 3 hours.<br>  <br>  Nobody listens to them.  No advertising money.

WsE51AD4aa	No. As a conservative, I think the States should handle spending issues as they are better placed to understand the problems of their people and there is less waste. That said, I could support it if it were financially sound and crafted by a bipartisan effort. Unfortunately, the plan is nothing like the New Deal it is often compared to. It spends most of the money on one time payments. Contrastingly, The New Deal, which cost less than the stimulus, spent most of its money on infrastructure projects that remain to this day. <br>  <br>  Also, the plan was constructed without Republican input (3 senators doesn't count for much) and was constructed too quickly. The first version of it passed the House in less than two weeks with almost no debate. The Democrats held meetings behind closed doors, pushed through the largest spending package ever in less than a month with little debate, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed the Democrats didn't need Republican input. Why?<br>  <br>  She said "Yes, we wrote the bill. Yes, we won the election." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con..." rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a><br>  <br>  Of course that only makes sense, but, when her camp is constantly babbling about bipartisanship, that kind of attitude is inherently hypocritical and reveals claims of bipartisanship to be disingenuous, media-friend ploy. <br>  <br>  If you want to read more, check out my website and my piece on the stimulus vs the new deal:|`|ejluOCdTaa	NO, but I have heard about some of the ridiculous things in it..and yep it will infringe on the census..Obama should never have done what he did by taking its autonomy away...just another thing he wants to control|`|BQY8b2YOaa	I do not have faith in it and no one has read the entire bill.

A true conservative would go after every political preacher, in this country, because they are an affront to the 1st amendment. A true conservative would never have allowed trickle down economics to destroy our industrial base, to the point that we now, not only import oil, but we import everything.<br>  <br>  I believe today's republicans suffer from a mental disorder that I refer to as Constupation.<br>  <br>  And I will never vote for another republican until, or unless, they learn how to hold their leadership accountable and take personal responsibility for the condition that our country is currently in.|`|ry3f5dxHaa	i would say the american movement. first off, we're in america. second of all, the conservative movement is more conservative and the nation as a phole works around the idea of habeus corpus, if not, the bill can essentially be dead. take batman for example, even though he's a hero everyone hates him. he does the right thing without extending beyond his limits. the difference is that gotham city is made up of more third party people, meaning there are three more parties involved. also, the conservative movement can be represented by pizza; conservatives are more like pinnapple pizza (you know, a lot more mavericky). liberals are much more popular, hence the reason why many view them as pepperoni and cheese pizza.|`|yprHJNHAaa	Definitely the conservative movement...anything different is not acceptable.

It doesn't take a brain surgeon, Conservative, or a liberal to figure out individually lead truth.  But most are in the lines of deception, and are led and taken care of by the very same affliction that caused their needs and made them rely on the government.

lPwdDpxgaa	All part of the globalists' plan.  NWO is NOT a conspiracy theory, and in fact, they are coming right out and saying it.  The problem is that the American media is not reporting on it.  <br>  <br>  Foreign countries are all making plans and preparations for a global system of 'financial oversight' which will then increase to include military actions, courts, rights, etc.  Research G-20, and foreign banking conferences being held as we write.  The US is also involved in these plans, although they have been keeping it under wraps.  However, Obama is an admitted globalist.  Clinton, Bush 1 and 2 were a little more discreet about their involvement, but they followed orders, including the Iraq war, which lessened the US power and standing in the world.  Now Obama is barreling as fast as he can to implement 'hidden' policies, and to bankrupt the nation so that the transition to a global government will go smoothly (on paper).<br>  <br>  They have also made plans to deal with any resistance - you can see how many bills that take away the rights of citizens are in the making.  Civilian defense force or foreign 'peacekeepers' will be used to control 'dissidents'.<br>  <br>  The partisan fighting and blame game is being used to keep the public occupied while the sovereignty carpet is being pulled out from under us.|`|5hxWSezPaa	My glass is half full.<br>  Your glass is half empty.
peeNituyaa	I think bigbad is being pretty trivial when explaining the difference between all 4 branches and there is actually a 5th one to consider.<br>  <br>  Marines-  Main funciton is front line combat.  Extremely gung-ho.  Lots of pride.  Tough bootcamp and continued physical training.  Quick advancement.  Good for the job you seek.  Less emphasis on IQ (sorry guys but you have the lowest score acceptance of all branches).<br>  <br>  Army-  Main fuction is combat.  Less gung-ho.  Less pride.  Tough bootcamp and continued physical training.  Quick advancement.  Good for the job you seek.  More emphasis on IQ than above but still more on combat.<br>  <br>  Navy-  Main function to control the Sea.  Way less gung-ho.  Less pride.  Hard bootcamp but more emphasis on learning than push ups.  Extremely traditional.  Slower advancement and unable to get the job you seek until you are an E4/E5 or above.  <br>  <br>  Airforce -  Main function is Security.  No gung-ho.  Average pride.  Tough bootcamp but mental not physical.  Advancement is at a crawl.  People retire at the E4/E5 level, ouch.  Good for the job you seek.  Out of all the above branches they take care of their people the best.  Barracks look like hotels, Chow Hall actually serves food you can recognize.<br>  <br>  Coast Guard-  Main function is Security on waterways.  A carbon copy of the Airforce except they do their Security on the water and mostly dealing with drugs and smuggling.  They are not Department of Defense (DOD) like the above.  They are Department of Transportation (DOT).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps and these are just in my opinion.|`|K8qAniReaa	All of the branches give higher ranks for having college credits.  The Marines give up to E-2 rank.  Every other branch gives up to E-3 for some college and E-4 with a degree.   If you graduate you have the option of being an officer.<br>  <br>  All of the branches have equal pay, same retirement, same health care benefits, and quality job training.<br>  <br>  Which branch you join depends on what you want out of the military.  If you want to sleep in dirt, eat MREs, poop outside 80% of the time, and spend the other 20% talking about how hardcore you are join the Marines.  <br>  <br>  If you want to do all that stuff but poop outside only 50% of the time join the Army.<br>  <br>  If you want to join for the travel or technical skills, see very little combat, and be nearly guaranteed a meal cooked on the stove almost every night join the Navy.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to travel much but you want the technical skills, very little combat, and a nice cooked meal almost every night join the Air Force.<br>  <br>  Every branch has MPs but for the most part they are all glorified security guards.  This is especially true in the Navy.  If you want to be a real cop try Air Force Security Forces.  These are hardcore guys who spend lots of time in Iraq and Afghanistan actually doing security.  It's not easy being Air Force SF but it's closer to a cop job.  <br>  <br>  Every branch has enlistment bonuses.<br>  <br>  ETA: Real Man have you ever eaten an MRE?

The problem is that in short order monetary supply and demand will flip, interest rates will have to go up to get fresh investors in and with all that money in the system inflation will skyrocket.<br>  I hope he fails too.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Because Obama's plan will bankrupt the present generation, and the debt will be paid by my kids and grandkids . . . <br>  <br>  Obama gives a GREAT speech . . no doubting that . . but he is a Socialist.<br>  <br>  I don't want Socialism to "succeed" . . .

This statement shows what an idiot he really is because if Obama fails, America fails. Have you noticed the brain washed Rush-odites who can't think for themselves are all saying the same thing. "We dont want to become socialists." I bet most don't even know what socialism is but Rush told them to say it.<br>  <br>  If you listen to and believe republicans that nothing Obama is doing will work then you are buying into their plan to destroy the economy by lack of confidence.|`|iIn80o4baa	Obama is a socialist who wants this country to turn from a free enterprise capitalist system to a socialist nation where the government provides for your every need at the expense of those who actually EARN their own money. <br>  In this respect Limbaugh wants Obama to fail.<br>  And I do too.|`|bZy74U06aa	Because National Socialism is not what America is all about.  The "stimulus" bill was never intended to stimulate the ecomony.  There is no way that it can.  It was obviously a bill to pay back all the far left radical organizations that bought the election for him like unions and ACORN.|`|nMx64x9yaa	Because the republicans would rather see America fail than for Obama to make it succeed.

9tcv3TiWaa	No if it is only 3 months long, in order for the military to pay for your family to go there or qualify for base housing the schooling must be 6 months or longer in one location.  After you get your orders then they can be with you if it is accompanied orders.  <br>  <br>  What you need to make sure you do before you get married seeing that your gf is pregnant is clear it with the Recruiter.  you are going from Single with no dependents to Married with 2 dependents.  This can cause major problems including delays which then causes you to miss school.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	As a general rule there are no family moves for assignments lasting less than six months.|`|Igb5vQK0aa	I'm not all that sure how it works in the navy but i know that while you are in school for the marines you live in the barracks. <br>  <br>  they usely have that info on the navy websites...|`|441dee0cd1dd4bd2bb05ebdf7f677464aa	You only live at the school base if you are single.

When it comes right down to it, we have no choice. We can either bellyache about what he does that we don't like or we can accept the fact that he is our President and therefore is in the drivers seat. I still let my representatives in congress know what I think, but that is all that we can do. In a crisis like this, even if congress can't seem to get their act together, we the people need to pull together to get ALL of us out of this.|`|Nj8RHxV6aa	As a person he seems like a nice guy but as the President of my country I feel he is leading us down the wrong path.  This country was founded by people that wanted less government not more government, by people that believed rights and responsiblities went hand in hand and we are moving toward a european model of government to the likes that we have never seen before.  I don't believe that this rampant spending is going to be good for us..yes it started with Bush but is being perpetuated dollar for dollar with a man that has only been in office for a month.  Half of the voters in this country voted for change in November and they are going to get all the change they could want!!!|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	I'll say it this way.<br>  <br>  I support no one who is this fiscally irresponsible, him, democrat or GOP.<br>  <br>  None of em.|`|u23sBafTaa	Can't stand the man he is a crooked , corrupt politician from Chicago and behaves just like one !|`|3db6387cfc0e238b5e0877910ab9366faa	No,besides not caring for his politics,I think he and Biden are a bunch of air heads.

They are bad for America.
5d9pCmjyaa	Most prisons - especially the maximum security ones - are specifically designed to dehumanize the inmate.<br>  <br>  When we treat people like animals for so long, what do we expect them to be when it's time to release them?|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	It isn't supposed to be a club med experience.<br>  <br>  What do you expect, private suites and hot tubs?<br>  <br>  They're criminals, they lost they're right to privacy when they committed their crime.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	Ok are you serious? Who cares! These people broke the law. If they live in skwaller who cares. Dehuminization is something they should have contemplated before commiting a crime. We need not feel pitty for criminals, just the victims. Would you want a child molester living next to you and your child. Humanize that.  Feel sorry for that person? If not you need find another question.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	no, they aren't in there to have a holiday, its punishment. Should we send them to Tahiti so they will get reformed? then everyone will be breaking the law|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Ummm just a slight correction there - about 1 in 10 inmates, men, are ever sexually assaulted and fewer are actually raped.<br>  <br>  There is a problem of institutionalization. This is where an inmate becomes complacent with the system. And not only that but dependent as well. Where they forget how to live life as a normal citizen on the outside and cannot stand being without the ridged structure.<br>  <br>  But even then, in most modern prisons non-violent offenders are given the chance to rehabilitate themselves through education, work release and drug rehab programs. Modern prisons offer a lot more to help inmates than they used to.<br>  <br>  Another problem is the reason people are put into jail. We've filled out prisons with drug addicts rather than the dealers who got them hooked. Granted there are dealers in jail, there are far more users. Corruption and an ineffective system cannot prevent drugs from getting into jails.<br>  <br>  We could go on and on about how prisons dehumanize individuals but what it comes down to is rather than pointing out the flaws, why not try to find a solution? What do we need to change and correct about not only the prison system, but our laws that put people in jail? What can we really do to fix those problems?|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	They got what they deserve. If they can't do the time, then don't do the crime.<br>  <br>  Some things are controlled but for the most part, inmates know how to get around the rules. Ciggs and cell phones are not allowed, but they still get them, lots of times, homosexuality and male rape is really rare<br>  .<br>  Why should prisoners have more rights then their victims? Why should the victim have to stay locked up in their own house afraid to go out after being beaten and rape in their drive way?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but they still have it to easy inside the prison. So they lose some freedoms but what about the person that they killed, they lost the choice as to whether they wanted to live or die, the person that killed them made that decision. How is that fair that he/she can chose to kill someone but still have freedoms and liberties to do what ever they want while locked up.|`|LOjtuXU2aa	There is favoritism too.  But, yes, it is dehumanizing.  My sons father is in for life for murder but he can have (if I sent the money to buy it) a TV, playstation, radio, etc. so there are plenty of unecessary freedoms too.  Someone is doing without a family member or friend due to the actions of a murderer, they should have nothing but a wall to stare at and a very simple meal 3x a day.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	I agree 100%. Yes prisons are supposed to be for punishment, but they have taken that too far.  They then wonder why released inmates are worse than they were before being locked up.|`|fEyuafVNaa	They are too cushy.  The prisoners should have to work hard labor to pay their debt to society.|`|nkr0Nvemaa	Our prisons are a complete failure. They are really nothing more than a school for learning how to commit crimes.

Bush turned his back on conservative values and McCain was little better.  So, the independent swing voters turned on the Republicans, which is what they deserved.<br>  <br>  I think that had the housing bubble not burst, the Dems would have had little chance of victory.  The primaries were chaotic and the way the DNC treated Hillary was a disgrace.  But as it was, we were facing a real financial crisis and were presented with a choice between a faux liberal and a real one.  It isn't so much that the independents were looking to elect a liberal, IMHO, so much as they voted for the guy that they thought was being less disingenuous.

AA11511852	Seeing as the Ninth Circuit Court is the most over turn court in the nation they will keep this record!<br>  It was put into place in the early 1950's when Communism was going strong and so was the cold war.<br>  There is no separation of church and state in the Constitution like many want to believe.  This came about because the aclu and the activist judges made many believe this.  What the founding fathers did not want was the problem that was going on in Europe with the Church telling the government what to do and how to do it.  All but two were men who believed in God in one form or other and stated that a man who wanted to hold a governmental office must believe in God.<br>  With the frase " Under God " or not means little to those today.

Your opinion on this matter is what you believe is a law. The pledge is not a law, it is a statement of a shared belief. You can add or subtract any part of that pledge and still show your allegiance to the union.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hate that people believe separation of church and state is in the constitution. It is not!<br>  <br>  Read the first amendment carefully. It says you have the freedom of religion and that no government can stop you from expressing it(within certain feasible rights). Separation of church and state says that under no circumstances will the government take control of any religion and vice versa.<br>  <br>  No one is forced to say "under God". There should be no requirement. You chose to live in the U.S. You chose to remain here. If you were born here, blame your parental figures, but do not blame the system for it does not force a pledge on you.|`|3GXYel3Kaa	A bit more history of the Pledge is needed.  Francis Bellamy, a noted socialist of the time, wrote it in the late nineteenth century.  No mention of God was included.<br>  <br>  Saying the pledge in important events and in schools was not required or even common until the 1920's and until the advent of World War II (by which time the Supreme Court had ruled that students could be compelled to say it), one reciting the pledge held his right arm out in a Nazi-style salute.  <br>  <br>  The addition of "under God" was introduced in 1954, when many Americans sought to distinguish themselves from the Communists of the Soviet Union (and presumably elsewhere), who were officially atheist.  This emendation was very much a product of the Red Scare several years before.<br>  <br>  The pledge as it stands seems to me to be symbolically more important than possessing any actual value.  I suppose as rituals go, it is pretty innocuous.  That both sides of the debate try to make an issue of it perhaps argues for the questionable nature of the ritual itself.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|eulMjLtPaa	The words "under god" were added in the 50s, to show those darn godless Communists that we believed in god.  <br>  <br>  And I don't know what kind of timeless world you live in, but to me, 2002 is not "recent," which is when this decision was handed down.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like your teacher gave you an assignment she's been using for quite a while.|`|dL4x119gaa	i have never said the pledge of allegiance, and i never will.<br>  <br>  i refuse to pledge my allegiance to anything...|`|TJtifnxPaa	I am in my 50's. I love the Pledge of Allegiance just as it is. I loved saying it when I was in school. Our founding fathers developed this country based on Judeo-Christian laws and beliefs. Most of the people in this country believe in God, regardless of their religious beliefs. I see no reason to change it and I think it should be required for school children to take a moment each morning at school to say the Pledge. It reinforces the greatness of our country, even with all of its flaws, and it also reinforces an attitude of gratitude for the privilege of living here.|`|6EB2JDFmaa	Well I like it better than obummer's version:<br>  <br>  I pledge allegiance to obama, <br>  of the unenmployed of america,<br>  and to the government for which provides welfare,<br>  one nation without God, divisible in all ways but income,<br>  without liberty and justice for all.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	No God-No peace-----Know God-Know peace|`|028b4045d26c8c74302a643d0f4ae39daa	Well the Pledge bears alot of things that don't exist now but did once before.  God is truly a part of our nation. I think that even if your an atheist or an agnostic you should have to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the way it was originally written.  It doesn't say you have to believe in God.  But, its of great respect to all who live here and all who have fought in past wars so you can feel free to say as you want.  It requires the least bit of energy.  So why cut that out of the great Pledge.  Honor your country, and don't go as far as to destroy its very existence which many of men have built and fought for.
wPecJppdaa	It's definitaly an experience and not for the faint of heart I've worked in a prison before for 5 1/2 yrs as a cellblock Lt. and shift captain. The worst thing you could ever do is show fear, DO NOT under any circumstances hide your face, instead look the inmates in the eyes, trust me you'll begin to earn respect right away by doing this, and respect as anyone in corrections knows is the only thing that holds a prison together after all there are usually a couple thousand of them.  against 40-60 of us.

You will not be allowed to wear ANYTHING that is the same color as inmate clothing, or as you mention, hide your face.<br>  <br>  GrimJack:  Not EVERYONE in prison has committed a crime to be there.  The state of California even admits to 10% of the prison population is probably innocent.  If that's what they'll admit to, the real figure is probably closer to 30%.  Plea bargaining sends a lot of innocent people to prison.|`|kiOD8s8Kaa	Why are you majoring in criminal justice and taking classes in it if you can't handle visiting a prison?<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that everyone inside the prison has committed crimes -- probably some very violent crimes -- and that they all deserve their sentences.

Earmarks are those using the earmark system in Congress and Pork is that same program added without using the earmark program-no difference outside of letting people say "There are no earmarks in this bill" and not be honest though being truthful.  Semantics and political games.  Every think that a political system would add a system to identify the money they use to buy votes and pay back favors and call it earmarks because just adding it as pork got a bad reaction from the taxpayers-just the idea seems a little strange to me but if you believe you are truly above everyone else you can do it and get away with it.

I am an officer in Kentucky and these are the steps I took. I have found that departments like to see if their applicants have been to the military or college. For me I went to college. If you go to college, law enforcement courses are what you want to take. I have seen departments only require a high school diploma but they will hire a college graduate over them. Second I would go on ride alongs with a police or sheriff department in your area to make sure it is what you want to do plus you can make contacts with officers to put down as references on your applications. I put applications in many departments in my area to better my chances of getting on to a department. When you go through the hiring process you will probably have to take a writen test, a physical test, and an oral interview. Hope this helps and good luck.|`|EJ8RZF7taa	Hello, I'm not actually a police officer myself (I've done extensive research which may or may not help you) and hopefully actual police officers will give you further info (in which they probably will by the time I finish writing my answer). Anyways the steps to becoming a police officer should start DURING high school. You will want to take some phys.ed. courses (especially weight lifting if it is offered), you may also want to take an introduction to law (I did mine in grade 11 but realized it wasn't really necessary). Furthermore, take Challenges and Change (it is a mix of psychology, anthropology, and sociology) this a course actually taken in Basic Police Foundations in colleges. Your secondary school may also offer a co-op placement with your local police services which I would highly recommend because you will get hands on experience with various but limited/restricted (for example no ride along) aspects of the police work, the co-op placement in my city gives people who have gone through the placement a REFERENCE for 5 years! Additionally, senior math is recommended and college or university English is required as with any career. After high school I would recommend going to college (I will be doing a Community and Justice program) I would not recommend taking the seemingly obvious course which is "Basic Police Foundations" as it is everything they basically teach you at the police academy and it will not give you an edge on competition. Overall police services are looking for physically/psychologically fit people. You may want to search google.com for further info. I would recommend searching for the site of your local police services as they will have better info. Also, police services usually hold sessions for citizens to learn more about policing. You may also want to go to your local police station and ask them about possible learning opportunities. P.S. YOU NEED LOTS AND LOTS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS. If you have anymore questions or concerns I will try to answer them to the best of my abilities. Good luck!

BSEyeMoMaa	Philip J. Berg, Esquire, the first Attorney who filed suit against Barack H. Obama challenging Senator Obama's lack of Constitutional "qualifications/eligibility" to serve as President of the United States and his cases that are still pending, Berg vs. Obama [2 cases – 1 under seal] and Hollister vs. Soetoro a/k/a Obama announced today that he will be on Michael Savage Nation tonight at 6:30 p.m. E.S.T.<br>  <br>  Berg stated, “I am thrilled to be on Savage Nation as Michael Savage has a widespread audience [10 million listeners who tune into Savage each week - on WOR in New York, KNEW in San Francisco, WKRO in Boston, or hundreds of other stations nationwide] and Michael asks the tough questions. The last time I appeared our dialogue regarding Obama was so great that I turned out to be the longest guest ever, being on for 1 ? hours.<br>  <br>  My appearance will help in our efforts to spread the word as the major media continues to refuse to cover this story – the most significant story in the history of our country; the biggest "HOAX" perpetrated on the citizens of the United States in 230 years, since our nation was established. Obama must be legally removed from office.”<br>  <br>  Berg continued, “I believe that 10 to 15 million people are aware of the Obama 'HOAX,' and we must make 75 million people aware. When people are made aware of the Obama 'HOAX,' that Obama has not proven he is constitutionally 'qualified/eligible' to be President; that Obama has not produced his original (vault version) 'Birth Certificate;' that Obama has not produced legal documents to show he legally changed his name from his 'adopted' name of 'Barry Soetoro' from Indonesia; they will demand Obama be removed from his office of President of the United States."<br>  <br>  Berg concluded, "I am proceeding for the 305 + million people in 'our' U.S.A., for 'our' forefathers and for the tens of thousands of men and women that have died and/or been maimed defending our Constitution, with our legal fight to prove that Obama is not constitutionally qualified/eligible to be President."<br>  <br>  The following is an update on my three [3] pending cases regarding my challenge to Obama's lack of qualifications/eligibility to be President.<br>  <br>  Also, I am preparing to file a 4th case - Quo Warranto [challenge person in office - that does not meet the qualifications].<br>  <br>  As you know, I was the first to legally raise the issue - having filed my lawsuit on August 21, 2008, before the DNC Convention<br>  <br>  Status of Cases:<br>  <br>  Berg vs. Obama, Third Circuit Court of Appeals No. 08 – 4340<br>  Berg filed Brief on 1/20/09<br>  Response Briefs from Obama, DNC and FEC filed on 2/17/09 (Appellees)<br>  This is the case that was dismissed in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of PA<br>  Judge Surrick dismissed for lack of "standing" by Philip J.

2zym4J9xaa	The U.S. never went to war with Vietnam.  War was never declared on Vietnam.  There was a conflict there though back in the 60's.  It was known as the Vietnam Conflict.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	It also has to do with the domino effect, or the theory that if Vietnam fell, that soon the whole of south east asia would turn red too.<br>  <br>  The sad thing is that the Vietnam war never had to happen. In the late 40's Ho Chi Min (before he turned communist) actually petitioned president Truman to join the union. At this time Ho Chi Min was little more than a rebel, a thorn in the French's side. And Truman ignored him. Over the next couple of decades, the Vietnamese (well as others in south east Asia) started to show greater and greater resistance towards age old colonialism. Vietnam was a French territory and returned to French hands at the end of world war 2. <br>  <br>  In the 50's the Vietnamese fought for independence. Ho Chi Min, the dominate leader of Northern Vietnam turned to communism in exchange for Chinese support. The Chinese began supplying the Ho Chi Min with weapons and pilots to fly Migs.<br>  <br>  By 1954 the French with drew from Vietnam. However in the wake of this conflict emerged a civil war between the pro-communist north and the pro-democratic south. Eventually the US and North and South Vietnam worked out a truce and established a demilitarized zone. But Ho Chi Min was not going to allow Vietnam to be divided. He wanted it to unify Vietnam as one under the Communist party (which really Ho Chi Min just wanted his home country to be independent).<br>  <br>  From here he established the Vietcong who acted as paramilitary opperatives on the south end of the DMZ. Although the US presence started as nothing more than just support, gradually more and more troops were sent as more and more violence began to escalate. Finally this lead to a boiling point and full scale war. Officially, the US never declared war on Vietnam. But US troops there will tell you it most certainly was war, if not office by the US, then by the actions of the communist.|`|MNqwUHypaa	top secret, i guess. most people that either died or fought their never knew. they just followed orders. it was always about following orders, nothing else.<br>  <br>  i recall it wasn't that big a deal until democrat lyndon birdbrain johnson took over. he was very bold and daring. he ramped up the war in vietnam and solved all the civil rights problems. now we have it made.|`|b653f9e79cd3f6e985dc3afbe09c9b14aa	poor  intelligence  and  a  big  lie  about  the  Gulf  of  Tolkin  Incident which  the   US   Govt.  now  admits  to|`|N4u9DRvFaa	A very complicated situation.

Reagan for his anti communist stance, they HATE people from the north (Helen took after 2 guy's at the mall once because they had accents from North Viet Nam, to say she was pissed is an understatement), they all wanted Sen Kerry to prove all the crap he claimed happened there during the war. Helens brother in law was a ARVN Major serving from 1955-1975, he wanted to cut off Kerry's manhood for lieing. <br>  <br>  This is complicated and full of emotion from all sides. The biggest problem with most in the US is they do not know the whole story and only a small portion of the truth.<br>  <br>  Why were we there? This in part is why:<br>  <br>  Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty.<br>  <br>  Did the US invade? No<br>  Was the US the only military Force there besides ARVN? No, S. Korea, Thailand, Austrailia and New Zealand all provided combat troops. The Phillipines sent non-combatants. <br>  Was the war fought by draftee's? No<br>  Was the war fought by Blacks? No<br>  Was the war fought by the poor? No<br>  Was the USS Maddox attacked? Yes, but only once, the 2nd reported attack was not correct.<br>  Did John Kerry commit a capital offense after the war? Yes, he violated Art 104 of the UCMJ by meeting in secret with N. Vietnamese Officials in Paris while he was still in the US Navy. The Max penalty being "death".<br>  <br>  SSG US Army 73-82<br>  Cousin on 26West, KIA 2nd tour.|`|AA12205273	Yeah, right. We're you awake in history class? Johnson (Democrat) wanted us in. WE faked an attack on one of our ships. The thought was we could free the North and restrain communism. Ten years later Ted Kennedy refuses to send South Viet Nam the money we promised and we lose all of South asia. Moral of the story: never, never believe a Democrat.|`|vPjbSBhJaa	It began as limited military assistance to our S.E.A.T.O. ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ) ally, South Vietnam.

c8ashFhAaa	All of the sources I looked at attributes McCarthy himself with the quote.  Perhaps he summarized what someone else meant?...|`|AA10811674	Charlie McCarthy gave a speech to Congress? I'm impressed.|`|wdxTxXHOaa	McCarthy unfortunately exploited for political purposes, a valid issue.<br>  <br>  Can there be any doubt that foreign nations subvert the will of the citizens through lobbying?<br>  <br>  Only they are not communists hiding in the shadows, they are lobbyists out in the open/<br>  <br>  Interestingly, if you study McCarthy's tactics, nobody uses them more effectivly today thatn those claiming to 'root out 'racism''|`|DLvHWOo7aa	McCarthy is the father of the modern republican party.<br>  <br>  A Fear/Hate mongering facist that sought the destruction of his opposition through smears, lies, and personal attacks exploiting a xenophobic distrust in the people for political gain.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	I do believe that it was either Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams! <br>  <br>   I have this quot before.

UFMvhn2Gaa	I think that's an incredibly high score and very hard to obtain. I scored a 60-something, but then again, I'm just 16. So maybe it will be possible after you get your bachelor's.<br>  <br>  Good luck man|`|mm5p5sy6aa	A 120 in what category?<br>  ASVAB is 1 through 99. Your composite scores can be higher though. My lowest was a 122 for example. You'll do good if you pay attention to the questions and answer with common sense.|`|UHBbSeesaa	My over all was a 76, comp  103.    gee wiz go for it!<br>  remember you are still a soldier no matter how smart you think or know you are!|`|cCBwK2EGaa	? if you mean your afqt score then yeah pretty freaking hard because all I got was an 85.  Depends on what category and I am currently involved in the PLC program so you don't need that high of an afqt and a decent sat should set you up.  The big problem is the pft regulations (if your enlisted your co's consent) and your degree.|`|GXilXsghaa	The highest score you can get on the ASVAB is a 99. Now it is different if your talking about the individual scoring such as GT.|`|7ATfLBoXaa	Not really, as there are many books in the library to help you achieve that score and more!
