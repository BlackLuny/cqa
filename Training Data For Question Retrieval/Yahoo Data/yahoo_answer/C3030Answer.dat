AA11452852	It is pretty hard to tell you the name and address of a bank without knowing which bank you want to find.  However, maybe this will help.  At the Web page below, you can find a list of pretty much all of the banks in Illinois, with links to their Web pages.  Click on the name of the bank you are looking for.    http://www.us-banks.net/us/illinois/inde...    Good luck, and I hope this helps!!|`|516e4lUJaa	whats the bank called??

W0hNoMSsaa	No. I am a native Californian and I love it here. My roots are here; all my friends and family are here. The scenery is great, the weather is mild and there is so much to see and do here. Why leave? Besides, my husband and I paid off our house before we retired, so the mortgage crisis hasn't affected us at all. <br>  <br>  By the way, we are not wealthy in case you were wondering. We live a modest lifestyle in a house that would be laughably small by most people's standards. But it's worth it to live in one of the best places in the world.
HfsZisOdaa	Taylor, I would encourage you not to post your age (and I suspect your name) and location on such an open forum. You don't know who reads these questions. As to your question, first I would suggest that you take a look at the laws regarding child labor in your state. That should be available on the state's webpage with a bit of looking. I suspect that you will be underage or heavily restricted in what jobs are available. Don't rule out such things as baby sitting, errands, some yard work and volunteer work that can help you build up a resume of experience for when you get a bit older. <br>  <br>  Good Luck To You!<br>  <br>  ~
