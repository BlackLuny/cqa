Sadly, it is the wrestler who gets penalized for the poor writing and overall creative process.  Furthermore, the lack of logical booking along with the continual repetitiveness of the wrestlers fighting (the same two wrestlers for several consecutive weeks in the same matches) hinder the success that these companies strive for on a weekly basis.|`|K7JfRjzMaa	Exactly. They have a tremendous amount of talent on their roster, but they don't market their product. That's the problem. They have a cable deal with SpikeTV, one of the biggest channels in cable, but they have yet to use that to their advantage. There are almost no ads for iMPACT! or anything else TNA-related. Until they learn to market, they will continue in the low ratings every week.    Oh, and the crappy storylines don't help either.

AA10232540	Depends on how you define "quality".    The 70's Yugo 123 grain stuff that Sportsmansguide has is fine, milsurp stuff.  It's brass-cased, which some folks prefer for some reason, but it's supposed to be corrosive-primed.  As long as your SKS is chrome bored and you clean after, it's no biggy.    Specs, it's almost exactly equal to American Eagle ammo.  It's not super hot, but it's far from being garbage.  With the ammo situation the way it is, it's about the best you'll find within reason.  Probably a good idea to stock up.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	And people called my nuts last year... I can't buy ammo right now but... I'm going to stop there.    Ok. ALL yugoslavian ammo is corrosive. It will perform as 7.62x39 does. The issue is cleaing. I would reccomend after using this stuff to blast hot water down the bore, gas tube, wipe down the bolt and gas piston with hot water then oil the parts to prevent rust.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	It will be crap. Before deploying to Baulklins we shot some of out body armour with a SKS and locally made ammo, thru and thru no problem, not ballistic armour mind you just standard flack jacket. Did the same trick over there with some of the captured ammo....stopped it with no prob, which is actually a good thing.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	It may be good or not, just as any other ammo.  I buy my surplus mil-spec ammo at Sportsmansguide.com and he doesn't sell garbage.  I have bought Estern-bloc stuff locally that wouldn't even fire when it started to drizzle!  That was some real junk.    As far as "quality" or "brand names," if a product is military specification (mil-spec) then it will perform to those specs.  The spec for these cartridges is a 123gr bullet, with muzzle velocity of ~2250 fps or so.  Any brand, or any country will make it do the same.

So, I would say you have to look beyond a collection of great talent and focus on leadership and coaching.  That pretty much knocks out the Cowboys, the Dungy-less Colts, the Ravens, and most of the NFC.  The Patriots will certainly be contenders, as they won 11 w/o Brady.  Of course that is the obvious choice.  So break it down by division. NFC/North- No solid QBs save for maybe Rodgers. Division winner- Packers. NFC West- Who Cares, probably Arizona again. NFC East- Aging Westbrook, Aging DF, Prissy McNabb=No Eagles. Division winner- NY Giants.  The South; Ryan needs another year or two, no way for Bucs, Panthers won't under Delhomme. So if the Saints stay healthy, they win it.  Giving you the Giants or Saints from the NFC. In the AFC, the west is terrible Chargers win at 9-7. Steelers repeat in the North. The south will go to the Titans again but their QB (whoever it will be) keeps them out. Dolphins and Pats from the East. So it will be. . . drumroll . . . a rather boring 44 as the Pats get revenge on the Giants.|`|8ImkKoNEaa	titans, look what they did to the steelers this year!|`|Q0CmJcpaaa	steelers|`|MPDgKgIxaa	Patriots    http://americanfootballpositions.blogspo...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|eZanMO8vaa	the team that scores more points....|`|kKw2FjgLaa	Eagles|`|5MiES2Igaa	stleers  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://internettvbox.blogspot.com/|`|IWPcs8kaaa	it will be NY giants vs pittsburgh steelers   NY giants 24  steelers 28|`|UuNx2TR3aa	1.Cowboys  2.

If you want hybrid you want poly for spin + durability + some synthetic for power and feel|`|NR5LhOpPaa	I'm not sure that's a great hybrid combo.  Both those strings are very powerful and durable.  Basically, there's a high chance that the racquet will play like a board with both of those in.  Usually, a hybrid uses a softer string for the crosses, and a harder, more durable string for the mains.  That's probably why you can't figure which you want for the mains: they would both be good for the mains.
5zqsMSLpaa	The guy that said dumb gm is an idiot the Rapters GM is Brian Colangelo.  For the last couple of years the Raptors weren't that bad they made the play-offs and won a division title.  This cummin from a true Raptor they brought him to help Bosh out and to guard guyz like Dwight Howard so Bosh wouldn't have to but the trade didn't pay off.  The Raptors have a good PG in Jose Calderone, they have a developing player in Andrea Bargnani, they got the best shooter in the nba Jason Kapono, Joey Graham and Jamario Moon who are great leapers. AND they got the main man CB4  In order for the Raps to start winning again they need a legit SMALL FORWARD one who could bang with the best like Danny Granger, Carmelo Anthony to name a couple and they need a new coach they should have never fired Sam Mitchell  I hope i answered ur question|`|AA11488609	Yes.  Bosh is effective as a center, but he likes to shoot mid range shots more than a back to the basket guy, like Garnett who can defend at center, but offensively is more of a mid range jumpshooter.  O'Neal is a back to the basket type of big man and the Raptors believed that he could help their team, but it hasn't worked out well so far.

6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	He used the ball as a prop during a touchdown celebration.  Under the rules of the NFL, that is unsportsmanlike conduct and is penalized with 15 yards assessed before kickoff.  That means the ball would have been moved back 15 yards from the normal position before kickoff.    If the refs had enforced that rule, Arizona may have only needed to cover about 50 yards to their end zone instead of 77 yards in the span of 35 seconds (15 yards back plus any yardage by Arizona's kick returner).|`|ZwF9pXDYaa	everyone is making a big deal of this, because it is a very big deal.  He used the ball as a celebration prop.  That is a 15 yd penalty by NFL rules and that rule was not enforced in the SuperBowl.

ZCCb38ikaa	I think the call was suppose to be "Unnecessary Roughness," but the ref made up his own terminology for it or something.   I didn't think it was legit, as the guy was stumbling and there was no way he could have stopped. If he hadn't have put his hands out like he did he could have hurt himself and the holder with an awkward landing.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	It was "running into the holder", which is in the rulebook.

They should not have called that.
A34HXSXtaa	It's not too late. To join your school soccer team, join a community team to get experience in. Also, start running and build your endurance, since the average player runs 5 - 7 miles per game. Since you are short and light, you should also try to build your speed (this is especially valuable for forwards, so work on your "finishing" (scoring goals) skills as well). Soccer has a lot of "sprint - recover - sprint" rotations. In our off season, we also did a weightlifting rotation to build muscles.    Work on your ball handling skills every day -- try to go for at least an hour. "Juggling" is a good way to do this. Also, talk to the coach and tell him your plan and see if he can give you any tips. In my high school, soccer was a spring sport and there was an open soccer period in the morning during the fall semester.    There are soccer camps during the summer. If you have the money and you are serious, I would consider attending one. There might be scholarships if you can't afford it. Try a google search.    Lastly, do your research. Attend your school soccer games so you can get an idea of their plays and read/watch as much soccer as you can to help learn technique.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	dont worry about your height man, look at diego buonanotte, hes 5'3 and he is a heck of a player, very tough and quick.|`|m5sjmm8Caa	i doesn't really matter how old you are. jest try hard and you can do it. im 14 to but i started when i was 4 and i have friends that jest started and are better than me|`|bi0qithaaa	Never,|`|yBXIqL7Yaa	ya  but ur need work hard  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://jlcinternettv.blogspot.com/

wx649tsuaa	Rey Mysterio was seriously better in WCW. In WWE, he is just feuding with wrestlers who are more than double his size. I don't mind Rey beating someone of his size but it is just riddiculous when he beats guys like Kane three times in row. He is known as the underdog but how is he an underdog when he wins every match, that too against such big guys. Therefore, the people too get tired of him.    Then there are his moves. His finisher Frog Splash is probably the fakest looking finisher. Because of his small size, it looks just unbelievable. Also, do you really think someone like Rey can counter Kane's chokeslam into a hurricana.    Don't get me wrong. I respect Mysterio. But he is just not a main event guy as WWE thinks him to be. He can't cut a good promo. Remember how so many fans hated it when he won the World Title ? If only WWE would bring back the Cruiserweight title, guys like Rey can be more valuable to the company.|`|VlsaWHebaa	Rey is good but he isn't as good as he used to.

The AFL Clubs are very reluctant to allow their star players to commit to the SofO in the middle of the Home and Away season.    Another option is for the State Based Leagues, ie VFL, WAFL, SANFL and the Tassie League, and possibly NSW and Qld to have a SofO comp.      It certainly will not be at the same level as it has been in the past nor at the same skill level as the AFL... but it would be true State of Origin.|`|94d210326a19c672cd98b1a32e43da78aa	The fans want SOO but the players don't.

c2dHrAEJaa	Willie,    You're absolutely right.  From my time here I've read many of the helpful answers you've given.  It takes time and effort to do so and you're sharing knowledge gained over many years.  Knowledge you've gained through experience and, probably, making mistakes like we all do.  Then someone comes along and rather than putting the effort in themselves, wants to short-cut the process by asking people like you.    I suppose some people do have the skills and tools but never having done it before want someone like you to confirm the "how to".    I spend some time in the "Motorcyles" category as I'm an avid rider and there is much of the same, if not more there.  "What bike should I buy?",  "How do you ride a motorcycle?", stuff like that.    I think I've answered only one question in the last two weeks!  Same stuff over and over.  But every so often someone asks a question that you want to help them with so we do.    Good Luck and know you're not alone.|`|OiAl6w48aa	I think any person who has skied for a long time knows the dangers involved when you start screwing around with your equipment if you don't know what you're doing.  We've all seen people come out of their bindings when they shouldn't have, not come out of their bindings when they should have, or just seen a binding disintegrate because of an improper mounting job.    Yes, skiing is a pricey sport, but most of these folks truly have no idea of the dangers involved in what they're asking.  I think of it in these terms: if I go to my mechanic and ask him how to swap the brakes on my car (and knowing that hammering nails presents a challenge to me), he'd laugh at me and tell me to get out of his garage.  Its the same difference - all these folks see is the price and they think to themselves, "hey, I could save $30!  All I gotta do is drill a couple of holes - no problem!"      I've been skiing for about 25 years now, and I still won't attempt to mount my own ski bindings and I actually know how.  But I refuse to attempt it because I don't have the right equipment or the experience of a someone working in a shop.  Given how important bindings are, its just not a chance I'm willing to take.  I want to know that they are on the ski properly and that I won't have any problems.  If I do, I just take them back to the shop and get them fixed.      I think the best thing you can tell these people is to just take their skis to the shop, or just skip the question.  I find myself doing that more and more just to keep my blood pressure down.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Cheap, uneducated and they are the ones that need to get out of the gene pool.  I no longer mount my own but I did when I started skiing. Remember the Marker Simplex M1?  and a turntable heel.  Those were easy to get on square  the new bindings have no tolerance for misalignment.  If the people who ask that question can afford to DIY after buying the jigs, the drill bits and special screwdrivers, and can go get trained by each binding maker let them.  After all one jig for each brand of binding, the metric drill bits, and the training for each binding should not cost much more than a couple pair of skis.  And since they are DIY, they have no need of liability insurance if they break a leg. Like who will they sue?  Us? We told them have the shop do it.   Hope everyone has a good season. The trees are blooming and my allergies are running.|`|DhEZj9cKaa	I dont know|`|sZ2ggavJaa	You might be right about skis, but it bugs me they charge that same $30 to put on snowboard bindings.  It's 4-8 screws total.. that's it, takes less than 5 minutes!?|`|wmyew1ERaa	If you have the right tools, including the proper size drill bits, the proper mounting jig to get the binding located correctly, the proper testing gear to insure that even a new binding will work as advertised, you will have spent many time the price of the binding much less the price of the mount job. Take it to a pro, it's cheaper.    Now, if we are talking non-release tele bindings, or even AT bindings which mount on rails and work even if mounted crooked, then by all means. Probably the pro doesn't have the mounting jig for these anyway.    To Josh, who complains about paying to mount snowboard bindings, you're right. Don't bother to take them to the pros. There are eight screws which go into pre-located and sleeved holes (no drilling). The only warning is to make sure you use the correct type of loc-tite which won't disolve the core material of the board. The only other question that comes up is what you need for a stance width and rotation. If you have these figured out, mount your own bindings.

It will be released in March 2009 to coincide with WrestleMania XXV. The game is being developed by YUKE's Future Media Creators and will be published by THQ, the same developer and publisher for the WWE SmackDown video game series.    Production of the video game was announced in May 2008 by THQ, respectively for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 video game consoles. A trailer for the game was released the following month at E3, featuring a recreation of the Hulk Hogan versus Andr the Giant main event at WrestleMania III.      Game modes    The game will feature three modes: Relive, Rewrite, and Redefine. In Relive, the player will be able to play as a legend that won a match over a certain wrestler. Rewrite will allow the player to play as the loser of a certain historic match in order to "rewrite" history. The player in this mode will be able to watch a recap of the history of certain wrestlers, a recap of their feud, and a recap of their match at WrestleMania. In this mode, the player has to complete certain objectives, besides winning the match. In Redefine, the player will be able to choose any wrestler to play as and the ability to change the match type; as of January 2009, the steel cage match is the only match type announced.

As long as your feet are facing forward when you start your feet are in the right position! You have to make sure your hips are up, your head is tucked in and you open up at the right time!!|`|UMcfRgCYaa	hi...i actually just learned my 360 flip but can only do it fakie.  The best thing i can tell u is to have ur back foot on the outside lip with the tip of ur toes and get a good scoop... have your front foot in the kickflip pos. but a little closer to the inside edge so it gets out of the way on rotation.  make sure u get a good scoop and try to push the board foward with your back foot cause it likes to land behind u...good luck!

giWvSwqRaa	I saw both fights and Michael Spinks didn't even try to fight back, he was dfinitely afraid of Mike Tyson. Floyd did try to fight back, he knew he was going to lose, he didn't have confident that he can hurt Sonny but he was at least trying to fight back.|`|WrDGhduxaa	That is a good question, but at least Patterson was able to last longer than Spinks.  They both knew they were facing sure defeat, they looked like a condemned man taking the final walk to the death chamber.   Spinks looked more afraid.|`|hIOkdSEFaa	that would be michael spinks he was crying in the dressing room before he came out to fight|`|CDeZOLmgaa	good question, I would say Patterson because of the fact that he actually brought a fake beard and sunglasses to the arena with him and used it to sneak out after he lost.    Patterson was asked to fight Sonny Liston by John Kennedy, Kennedy said he had to beat Liston in the name of the United States, and Frank Sinatra asked him to do him a personal favor and knock out Sonny Liston.    So here was allot of pressure on Pattersons shoulders    As for Spinks, he knew that Tyson was faster and hit 100 times harder and he knew he was going to lose, and when the fight started he was like a deer in the headlights. Spinks was scared shitless    But because of the fact that Patterson brought a disguise to the arena, and had all the pressure on him going in against a guy he knew he could not beat I would say Patterson was more afraid then Spinks.      Floyd Patterson actually admitted to being terrified of Sonny Liston.    Micheal Spinks obviously was but never came out and admitted too it.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I have to admit, the stark terror on Spinks's face on the way out to the ring against Tyson was unmistakable.  Floyd wasn't so much afraid of Sonny as he was Sonny's "friends", there were a few Italian gentlemen who hung out with Sonny that would have struck fear in the hearts of just about anyone.      Spinks was more afraid.|`|6QhACK70aa	chad dawson to face diaconu make these 2 u mention look fearless:)lol    to ur question tho ,Patterson is an A level fighter, with tons of heart and A GENTLEMAN outside the ring!  did he have many weakness in his boxing style ??HE SURE DID!(specially his glass chin) but.............there is a huge but...... a legend and a gentleman like patterson, i doubt he had any fear against whoever,if he could not win, he always took it like a man!just because he could not handle liston, does not mean that he was affraid of him!NO WAY!He just   could not beat him,that's all!simple as that    for spinks and tyson ,well only thing i got to say is this:  when u mention in a question someone like Patterson ,is a Blasphemy to compare him with some people named Spinks or tyson;)|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	gotta go with spinks. patterson at least tried to avenge his loss in a rematch wher spinks retired afterwards.|`|1GyqL8jyaa	Michael Spinks?|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	I watched most of Spinks fights from Olympics through the end of his career.  I didn't know who the guy was who fought Tyson that night.  Didn't recognize him.      I never saw Patterson afraid of any fighter.        Spinks was afraid.
DlvDGQgpaa	Crosby is a diving crybaby  i am canadian but ovechkin is overall WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY more talented.|`|Fh0shlVLaa	AO is MUCH better than Sindy Cheapcrybaby.    Ovech can hit, fight, shoot, anything.    One thing Crosby does better is cry, oh another thing, cheapshots.|`|Bv0I2aRAaa	Light years better...coming from a Bruins fan...AO is a beast...He seems to be everywhere on the ice...The Whiner on the other hand...ha...he is barely even noticeable...|`|9nMOFOoQaa	Ovechkin is the best player out there and crosby is close. Close to maybe the 10th best.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	They're about even.  Ovie takes more than three times as many shots as Sid so of course he'll score more goals.  Ovie scores on less than 10% of his shots and Crosby about 15%.  Still, Ovechkin is the better goal scorer and Sid is the better play maker.|`|KyCJOR2paa	Depends what kind of player you want.  Do you want a playmaker or a goalscorer?  Personally I think Ovechkin is more dangerous and can change a game quicker than anyone else.  I haven't ever seen anyone who can shoot the puck like him.  In reality you can't compare them because they play different styles.  I think if you ask all the NHL GM's, every one of them would take Ovechkin over Crosby if they had to choose and position didn't matter.  That's how much better he is.  They both make their teammates better.  Crosby because of his vision and playmaking.  Ovechkin with his energy.  But pure goal scorers beat playmakers anyday.  Ovechkin needs very little room or teammates to be effective.    If my team is hanging on by a one goal lead late in a game, there is one player I fear the most... Ovechkin.  Heck, I fear Ovechkin every time he's on the ice.  His shot is lethal.  He is one of the only guys in the league who routinely can put the puck "through" a goalie.  On many of his goals, it seems there is no way the goalie should miss it... the goalie would stop it if it was anyone else.  The shot just gets on them way faster than they are used to, even though they KNOW he is going to shoot, they still look like a lost puppy in net.|`|Q8amh0rUaa	Ovie is way better.  He knows how to score and hit.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	They are vastly different players. Crosby is a premier play-maker. He makes his line-mates better. The game slows down when he is on the puck. Ovechkin is a physical force that can manufacture offense by himself. He does everything at full speed. Crosby thinks the game while Ovechkin allows his natural talent and inner-drive to take over. As far as pure goal scoring is concerned, the edge goes to Ovechkin. He can score in a multitude of ways. Ovechkin's enthusiasm for the game is contagious. He elevates his team-mates with his passion for the sport. I wouldn't call either player a great leader nor would I describe either as solid defensively. Both are elite players that get the job done in different fashions.|`|q3E24CPjaa	Ovechkin is more exciting than Crosby and a far more physical player, but they are so close as far as which is the overall better player. Crosby plays a better defensive game than he gets credit for and is the better passer. Ovechkin has that shot, though, and still attacks a defense with reckless abandon. Crosby has gotten more conservative over the last two seasons. He doesn't attack like he used to, which leads to fewer highlight-type goals. I'm a Pens fan, but I have to give Ovie a razor-thin edge, because he seems better able to simply create more goals from his own effort alone. Both are great, but Ovie is just so electrifying. In the end, it's about goals, not points. Ovie wins by a nose.|`|Ym3FbmVOaa	Crosby may have be good at setting up goals, but guess what, Malkin has even more assists than him and about the same number of goals. Now an assist is one thing, and while without a good assist there's no goal, that's not always the case and EVEN with a good assist you still gotta score, sometimes players can't put the puck into a virtually empty net, so a good pass is not a goal yet. You need Ovie to score the goals. 52, 46, 65 - these are real goals by A.O. in the last three seasons, he scored each and every one of them, the puck found the back of the net, while an assist simply means the player touched the puck before someone else scored.|`|4go3lFooaa	3.14159265358979323846 . . .|`|F934e4HQaa	CROSBY IS BETTER|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	Joe Thornton is better than both but he never gets talked about because he plays in the west.|`|aLq8tT6Qaa	they are both well evened players..i cat say why one is better than the other..the only setback on ovechkin is hes not a team player..he thinks shot...shot...shot...pa..shot crosby is always the best play|`|BhXMno7faa	Alexander Overchkin has more talent and nothing can keep him out of a game. when he came back from the all star break, his next game in the second period he hit the wall hard and went to the locker room and was back in the game in the third period.|`|6Ojpl6viaa	Hes not.  Sid is the better player.  Hands down.  There is more to a player than just shooting.  Look at the overall play.  That is what makes him great.  But I'm  sure you are just a highlight fan.  Hockey is a team spot, and is played BOTH ways.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	I think Crosby is better then Ovechkin!

ZCCb38ikaa	No doubt the refs were crap in this game, and they have been in several games this year.   I wonder if officiating is just going downhill, or if we are just now starting to notice it more?  Anyway, if something doesn't change next year, this will be known as the "Age of Bad Officiating" in the NFL.  Refs had some bad calls both ways last night, but it was more against the Cardinals than the Steelers, no doubt.   There have been several games this year and in recent years were I fear the game was NOT decided by the players and coaches :(|`|Q0CmJcpaaa	umm there were horrible calls that helped the cards 2. warners fumble at the end was reviewed. it was a fumble. fitzs first td actually touched the ground. so it shouldnt have counted. the hold that gave them a safety was a very borderline call. boldin threw a punch at tayler and tayler was flaggedthere were numerous holds by the cards oline that werent called. get over it. you lost to a better team.|`|rQH2J6euaa	wahh wahh wahhhhh.  how about the bs safety call?     maybe you should watch a little more sportscenter bc all ive been hearing is that its been probably the best superbowl game ever played.  the better team won, but the cards didnt stand a chance.  even with fitz making that td in the end couldnt save them.|`|IWPcs8kaaa	STOP HATE IN ON THE STEELERS THEY ARE GOOD JUST GET OVER IT|`|PaMTtUXbaa	I was there at the superbowl and saw it all go down in person.  It's obvious now that the NFL has something against the NFC West.|`|g5wninniaa	that guy under you is right...that holding call in the end zone was questionable bc if u watch the replayed...the center has him under his shoulders and he just rushes over him and they BOTH fell.    1) how many holding calls do u think that can call on that? im sure there was at least 4 they can call...larry fitzgerald made him stay in bounds...look at the replay..the guy hits him out and fitz hits him back in.    2)that roughing the passer was not a penalty but that didn't make them lose the game..it was before they started the comeback    3)Holmes celebration should have been called but it probably happen after the refs went towards to replay bc Holmes stayed on the ground with his teammates were on top of him...that still didn't hand the steelers the game. what SHOULD have happen was, the cards should have not allowed that catch...there was THREE cards in front of him and he still caught it...bad defense to me.    4) In the NFL...every play is looked at from upstairs under 2 mins of each half...when its really really questionable....upstairs signals the ref to look at it. his arm was COMPLETELY ****** back when he lost control...therefore it is a fumble...and honestly...how many times do u see that work? a QB that scrambles wildly and throws it up...i don't care if fitz can jump high..its always usually a interception. he had 50 yards to go with at least 8 steelers playing the long ball deep. esp if it was tipped..it would have been a lame duck...they would have had 6 secs left on the clock if it was incomplete..and if it wasn't...the ball wouldn't have got down the field until at least 2 or 3 secs left...and if they DID catch it, not in the end zone..time would have expired!    5)Polumolu was held on that go ahead cards drive and it wasnt called..and if it was...take away that 30 yard play.  6)well they called a penalty on him...and just bc they did doesnt mean he wont be fined or suspended. plus its hard for the ref to spot that...esp since it was on a punt..they seem to try to watch the play down field bc they look for blocks in the back. atleast there was call..and it resulted in a saftey and the cards got the ball back.    7) i dont remember the 2nd challenge but come on...the first challenge was reasonable...it defiantely looked like he got in the endzone so it was a good challenge.    it was a great game...the refs didnt hand the game to them...people need to chill|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Im glad to see some people standing up to these whiners. Thumbs up to all of you!!|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	1) You're dreaming.  There was no block in the back on that return.  There was, however, a Cardinal who ran at least 20 yards out of bounds who came back in to make the tackle.    2) It was very close.  I probably don't make that call, but I also don't have the NFL constantly preaching to protect the QB.  Still, a marginal call at best IMHO.    3) Good "no call" by the officials if they even saw it.  It happened so long after the touchdown that the officials were, no doubt, setting up for the next play.  Besides, imagine the outcry if they do call it.  A guy cannot get a little slack when he scores the go-ahead touchdown in the last minute of the Super Bowl?    4) The play was reviewed by an official in the replay booth.  He correctly saw it was a fumble and there was no chance it would be overturned.  Warner lost the handle on that ball while his arm was motionless.  It was clearly sideways in his hand and falling out by the time his arm moved forward.    5) Sorry, but every holding call they replayed was clear as day.  As was the holding call that cost the Steelers a safety.    6) Harrison did get a personal foul penalty on that play which led to the earlier mentioned safety.  This is the NFL, a lot worse happens when guys don't think officials are looking.  I'm sure he as warned that he better not try anything like that again or he'd be watching the rest of the game from the locker room.      7) The two challenges won by the Cardinals were ajudicated by who?  The referee.  That same referee who you claim was so biased against the Cardinals with the holding and roughing the passer calls.  Do you see the flaw in your logic?      Of course, if you think you can officiate better, volunteer with your local association next season.|`|SgumEvuraa	they did clearly just like 05 when the refs handed the superbowl to the steelers over the Seahawks.  The Steelers have ZERO legit super bowls in the past 5 years|`|0bys5NAOaa	i guess you are a cardinals fan.|`|oWlQ5lH9aa	AZCats, thanks for answering this one...I was just checking in on Answers to see how much complaining there was going to be, and comparing it to SB XL, and the refs suck, and blah blah blah.

It's history, now. Move on,dude. All the complaining in the world is not going to change things. There are no Steeler players or fans who are just going to turn over their victory to the Cardinals because most everyone is bitching. Steelers won, live with it.|`|7InY2vuraa	1) yeah right. ok. keep telling yourself that if it makes the cardinals loss less hurtful. clearly the steeers didnt play hard at all. the refs just decided to let the steelers win superbowl XLIII    2) in the NFL there is a rule that you can only take one step before contact with the QB when he releases the ball. the guy took more than one step.    3) he was penalized genius.    4) that was definitely a fumble. the ball was clearly knocked out of warners grasp BEFORE his arm began to move forward.    5) of course the cardinals were holding against the steelers. youve got to be out of your mind not to hold against them. its common sense.    6) build a bridge and get the f**k over it. they let ray lewis play and he's a murderer.    7) WOW! you finally stated a fact!! CONGRATULATIONS!|`|0BgzkLdUaa	Yeah, the Cardinals were treated unfairly... But the Steelers won... and nothing is going to change that unfortunately.|`|Uh7HagITaa	1. it wasnt a CLEAR block in the back he got one hand on the inside of the pads and thats all thats required, and besides you didnt mention that fitz ran the whole play out of bounds then came into make the tackle.  2. give ya that one, but did it really affect the game that much? didnt think so  3. i guess they didnt see since it was so long after the catch, he laid on the ground for a good minute  4. that was a fumble, REVIEWED upstairs by an official who decided it was such an obvious fumble that there was no need to have the head ref waste everyones time looking at it. there job is to get the call right, not have a courtesy review just to make it look better.  5. what call, oh maybe you mean the one against the steelers on the TD drive, or the one for the safety, or the one against polomalu that wasnt called, or the million on harrison that werent called  6. hell my sister punches harder than that, he got his penalty for unnecessary roughness  7OK    youre a loser|`|faT4MyVkaa	Yep, another gift to the Steelers. To be fair though, the cards suck. This superbowl looked like a couple of college teams going at it. Worst two teams in a superbowl ever.|`|aOx2hovgaa	does the whittle baby need his dieper changed.
srVQ1tTLaa	My Magic 8 Puck says it is likely.....|`|axxQzOCHaa	I see them making the playoffs, but without Morrow and all that time lost with Avery is gonna make it tough for them to do much especially as Turco has been inconsistent.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	60.3% yes and likely the 8th seed|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	I hope they get the 8th seed and since the sharks will be the number one seed the sharks can get some revenge on them i see the sharks sweeping them.|`|cbdeb64f97f05d48aaa09e1f49920046aa	I think they will. Dallas always has strong runs at the end of the regular season. Not only that, but they do very well in the playoffs also. I see them losing to San Jose in the Conference semis.|`|BhXMno7faa	No, because there are better teams out there that can take a victory over the dallas stars     GO BOSTON BRUINS|`|XqMWLvJDaa	Yeah, I see them making a 6th or 7th seed.  With this huge home schedule in February, they will further themselves from the pack and obtain the 5th seed after Chicago.  Then, when March and April comes along they will probably lose their heat they got from February and lower themselves into a 6th or 7th seed, could be 8th if the other playoff contenders can keep up with the stars..
fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Colorplace paint is enamel. It is OK for a lawn chair or wheelbarrow but NOT for a bike. You'll end up with a terrible mess. Consider the grade of paint you'll get for a dollar before you proceed.    Painting a bike well takes a bit more than a whim, a 6 pack, and a weekend. Do it right and it will look great, do it wrong and you'll wish you never did it.    This answer is long but will give you an idea of what to do. Want a quick answer? Take the bike to an auto body shop and have them do it. It'll cost about $100 if YOU take the bike apart.    Use DUPLICOLOR brand LACQUER available at most auto parts stores. In the UK, I don't know if the brand exists so you'll need to locate a brand of acrylic lacquer. DO NOT BUY ENAMEL OR URETHANE!    You'll need 1 BIG can of grey sandable primer , 1 can of base coat (if the color requires it... many do... read the can), 1 BIG can or 2 SMALL cans of the color you want, and 2 or 3 BIG cans of clear LACQUER.     Here is a quick explanation of what to do...    1) After completely disassembling the bike have it sandblasted to remove ALL the finish. If the frame is aluminum, it should be walnut shell blasted, or you can chemically strip the paint. Just make sure all the paint is OFF the bike.     2) READ THE CAN INSTRUCTIONS, then spray it as soon as possible with grey SANDABLE lacquer primer. DUPLICOLOR brand paint is all lacquer, I think, and you can get it from your local autoparts store. Buy the BIG cans, not the small ones. Apply at least 1 full can, in coats, 15 minutes apart. Don't worry about light runs for now.    3) Wait at least 48 hours. There is a difference between dry paint and cured paint... it needs to be cured. Sand the primer using 220 grit aluminum oxide paper (white in color) or wet/dry paper (black in color) until the surface is smooth. It shouldn't take much unless you have a lot of runs.    4) Using a tack rag, lightly go over the entire frame (don't rub!) to remove the sanding dust.    5) Apply several coats (3 or 4 perhaps) of the base color (if necessary), then color of your choice. Make sure the frame is completely covered, it is not necessary for the color to be on thick. Follow the directions on the can. Again, use LACQUER, the same brand that you used for primer. Apply coats 1/2 hour apart. Be sure you cover every part and do NOT get runs. If you get runs you are applying it too heavily.    5a) IF you wish to add decals, wait at least 8 hours, apply the decals, then continue. Make sure that you avoid touching the new paint as much as possible and to make sure there are no marks from water or "sticky stuff" on the frame. If you don't want to add decals, continue immediately to the next step WITHIN 24 HOURS...    6) Do NOT sand the color coats. Apply the LACQUER clear coats, perhaps 2 full cans worth, coats 15 minutes apart. If you put decals on you should spray at least 4 cans of clear.    7) Let the frame alone until you can't smell the paint anymore when you get up close and take a big whiff. If you can smell it, it ain't dry! This will take 2 to 3 days at least.    8) Wet sand the entire frame CAREFULLY with 800 grit silicon carbide wet-or-dry paper (black in color), then 1000 grit silicon carbide wet-or-dry. Make sure to keep the paper wet and to wipe away the white slurry that forms. If you start to see the color in the slurry, STOP! You have sanded too hard and reached the color coats. Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7, then try again. Don't try to "touch up" the area, it will look terrible.    9) Using white paste polishing compound, follow the directions and polish out the whole frame.    10) Do NOT wax or wash for at least 10 days.    If you rush this you will end up with a sloppy mess and you'll kick yourself for ever trying. However, if you take your time and do it right it'll be a very cool feeling.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You want to remove everything you can.  You want to wet sand the frame and remove any grease or oil.  This site should help.    http://www.wikihow.com/Paint-a-Bike
ZCCb38ikaa	It's hard to say. The Cards were moving the ball at will during that time, but do you really tell Larry Fitzgerald to "get down and don't score" even if he has a wide open field?   I in the NFL, you gotta take points any way you can. I think it was the right thing, score anyway and however you can.   The Cardinals defense SHOULD have been able to stop the Steelers if they really wanted to win that one. Yeah, there were a lot of questionable and some really bad calls, but it all comes down to if the Cards really wanted this, they wouldn't have let Holmes get by triple coverage in the endzone.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	Kurt Warner saw him wide open. He had to slick it to him. Come on it is the Super Bowl.|`|aR64sqyBaa	It's a loaded question to ask if a team scores 'too quickly' especially if you are already behind in the game.  The alternative of NOT scoring would be a lot worse outcome.|`|Jp2415Whaa	Card Fan.  Yes I think they did.  What woulda been more risky but if executed, EPIC : Fitzgerald kneeling at the 1 yard, then Cards using both timeouts to waste all the time possible, and JJ or James running it in, or doing something that had worked 74 times in the regular season....throw it in - let fitz come down with it.  It's too risky, but imagine that.....Amazing if that happened.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	In retrospect, yes.  However, do you really expect someone to not score the go-ahead touchdown late in the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl when they have the chance?  The Steelers had the top ranked defense in the NFL so you score on them when you have the chance and let your defense try to win the game for you.|`|rQH2J6euaa	agree, but im just glad the steelers won    :)  james harrison shouldve been mvp for that 100yd play|`|lxe8tTyNaa	I agree. However, it was a great t.d.
MGTnkGnWaa	I played with a two handed backhand for 8 years, and let me tell you that it was a lot better than those who tried with one. Just try it with two hands to build up a lot of strength before trying one. My advice is to watch The Tennis Channel or look up The Tennis Channel hints and advice. They have videos of like one minute drills to help many things.|`|qGWj3EVPaa	Well Im a one hander and stuck with it so I suuggest you go with whats ever more comfortable im tall so I got a one hander but if your short I suggest the two hander and videos online arn't gonna help you need coaching if your serious about it|`|BRTa5h7iaa	One hander: more versatile    Two hander: more power
xOReEw6Waa	http://library.fws.gov/nat_survey2001_de...    That will give you an overview of deer hunting, at least for that survey period. Each state is going to have their own statistics and that is going to be hard work gleaning that out for all 50.|`|lpMNkOgkaa	I don't think that there is a web site that will have all of the states licensing departments information. Each state is in charge of it's own licensing.  Here is the link for my state: Utah  http://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/  Sorry, we don't have any White tail deer in this state, just Mule deer.|`|9wfmpBMWaa	In Wisconsin you will need to go to the Wisconsin DNR web site.
qCt3yUNlaa	Yes, your friend would most likely be kicked out and escorted by security. And by the way, it's been done before. I wouldn't recommend it.|`|evEJxv06aa	you will get escorted  by the security right than.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	he get knock the f out|`|K7JfRjzMaa	He'd be thrown out. Duh.|`|lkw5ZyDIaa	he will get thrown out|`|ayFd2u7naa	I've seen it happen before. Lets just say if there is a wrestler in the ring you are more then likely not going to make it out of the ring. I also don't think you would make it to the ring. They have tightned security so much now-a-days. Plus most arena's have cut back on normal security and they have been replaced with police officers. So you are more likely to go to jail.|`|YdCPmxivaa	They take them out back and shoot them in the head.|`|i1YnDdcLaa	YOU WILL BE IN JAIL AND BAIL WILL  BE SET AT $5 MILLION DOLLARS!|`|MdYQlMfeaa	they would get escorted out by security, maybe worse.. this is why I laugh when the wwe does These fan storylines like with rosa mendez And santino.. soo gay.. if A real fan does that they aren't allowed back.|`|rs7fuvPxaa	you get thrown out and like cant attend WWE live|`|hvdnE31Faa	You won't get thrown out if you can run
46Mxaw13aa	never never never never never give up on your dreams its not dumb work as hard as u can and lift a lot but dont be discouraged if youre not as strong as u think just keep working hard. trust me if you work as hard as can everything will take care of itself. everyone may think youre small but just play with a chip on your shoulder this way u have something to prove. nothing is gonna be handed to you on a silver platter you gotta go take it!!! goodluck|`|dFyRPqY1aa	follow your heart :)|`|G1OJNCF4aa	No you will get taller no worries, :) try it out, its worth trying if its your dream. Start earlier then you will be a small badass!|`|Afmv2WYSaa	No your not to small to dream.|`|Aw26KuJcaa	eat more protein, LIFT WEIGHTS work your arms, chest and calf muscles put on about 20lbs. don't do it in fat, my boyfriend was a full back in high school  thats fairly small for a half back but in the end what matters most is speed and strength but as of now just tone up and give it a shot|`|AA10718199	if your gonna dream, dream BIG!|`|gBfPkdroaa	i think youll get taller, up to 5'5 maybe??    but just stay at halfback, i kinda doubt you can break tackles at 5'3/103 lbs.    but you can probably be REALLY QUICK.    work on your agility.    research Darren Sproles or Maurice Jones drew.    they were great HB's and in special teams.|`|CNPrAG75aa	Its not how big you are its if you have the heart, will, and determination thats what will determine how good of a player you are. If you make the team strive to be the best and show that by playing every down like its your last. Not trying to be cliche but it works if u put your mind to it u can accomplish anything, GOOD LUCK|`|8juUgSK2aa	Darren Sproles is 5'6" and kicks butt for the chargers. Don't let your height get you down those big fat DE's and LB's will have a hard time catching you.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	i wish i were 103 pounds.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	research Jaime Morris|`|Q0CmJcpaaa	you are way to small and you will get hurt. if not killed. wait till some 6 foot 240 lb linebacker hits you. he will break you in half. you prolly will never see the palying field. dont waste your time|`|r0HYuHubaa	y are girls answerin this question?..
LxfjzzM2aa	Well if you are that worried, talk to your coach about it. You should not have to worry about someone dropping you. You are supposed to trust your bases. and when you come down, you know that they are going to catch you. and tell the girl. Leave her drama at the door, dont bring it to practice!
8UTJ0kFNaa	They need to get rid of the Pro Bowl and go to an awards show. Make the awards worth something to the players and do it in a dignified and classy way like the Heisman in college. This way the players are not at risk of injury in a meaningless game. The voting process could still be similar to what it is now. It could also be done as a part of the Super Bowl festivities on the weekend before the Super Bowl. This might stop the more recent practice of players opting out and replacements being picked to fill their spots. There could be a 1st team and a 2nd team award so players are rewarded much like they are in their contracts.|`|WHot3QXMaa	I enjoy the pro bowl but i always thought it might be fun the see the super bowl winners play a pro bowl team from the opposite conference... So this year like the Steelers vs the NFC pro bowlers...|`|g5wninniaa	sometimes theres a big hit....but thats it    u cant have it decided home field advantage...superbowls are always played at neutral sites and thats smart..i dont wanna have a blizzard effect the outcome of a game...the game seems to be like a vacation for players...and seriously...imagine if u got selected to ur first pro bowl?? it means alot to the players. it will make ur stock rise...being an pro bowler will get a better contract come free agent time. its just a congrats to the leagues best players!|`|369daff84a41e52e1e818e6cb9fc5724aa	Change the game to soccer.|`|aR64sqyBaa	I don't think there's much that can be done to make the Pro Bowl a worthwhile game, it would be such a waste to get injured in a game that means absolutely nothing.  The only worthwhile events are the skills competitions, which are usually always fun to watch.      Take a look at the NHL All-Star game.  There's pretty much no checking in the game.  Both are worthless even to the most diehard of fans.|`|AA11900717	I think the Pro Bowl is fun to watch.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Yes. Thanks for two points on this one partner. It's not a serious game only entertainment and money.|`|15wwA3jjaa	The Pro Bowl sucks!  Nobody wants to be there, they only show up to collect a check and get the Pro Bowl on their resume.  Personally I always thought it would be cool if they had back ups in the Pro Bowl, those guys would put on the game of their life just because it was their only chance LOL.  As sinister as it may sound, the only reason I watch the Pro Bowl anymore is in hopes that I will get to witness somebody rolling into Peyton Manning's knee and taking him out.|`|6GdeuiCgaa	There's so much money involved with players' salaries that neither they nor the owners want to risk much in a game that means nothing.    I read an article somewhere (Yahoo Sports, maybe?) that talked about a suggestion to move the Pro Bowl into the regular season somewhere, like the MLB All-Star Game. But again, with all that money in a high-contact sport, it probably won't happen.|`|XnbcCgboaa	The Pro Bowl is zzzzzzzzzz|`|MPDgKgIxaa	They need to make the winners share 10 times more then the losers, then you will see the players play for real.      http://americanfootballpositions.blogspo...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...

Good idea blu.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	The starters for the SB champs can only play in the first half.    http://americanfootballpositions.blogspo...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|YHeTQNpFaa	The ER would b crowded with concussed kids...lol|`|46Mxaw13aa	no it would be better to see the worst team play the college all stars but it would still be a blow out anyone that has played football would tell u that no college athletes can compete against pros. think of it like this.... how many rookiesmake a huge difference?? a couple do but they are set up with good situations example matt ryan having descent receivers and a good o line and a huge running game if you put all of the best rookies together they still couldnt beat the lions and just imagine if u had the college all stars play most of those guys are unproven and lots will be busts theres just no way|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	If you tied both Roethlisberger's hands behind his back, made Willie Parker carry Jerome Bettis along with the football, and told Holmes and Ward they had to run with their hands and catch with their feet...  I'd still bet on the Steelers.|`|GmW0bxGXaa	They should switch offensive and defensive lines and keep all the skill players on their teams...|`|rnH9NnZRaa	Maybe Flag football but not tackle|`|0X2Tymuoaa	Another way would be not having referees there. Then it might even things out for the college players, because we all know the Stealers can't win without their good zebra friends.|`|9944787f7b97209854b4040a6d619d15aa	it'd be worse than the pro-bowl.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	The QB has to throw with their off hand.

wKnjGSU1aa	Football, there's only 1, that's the one invented by the English. The one that's played worldwide. Anyways, the things I don't like about Tackleball are:    1. There is way too many flags, you almost get a flag in every single play. There's too much stopping of the game.    2. There's way too many commercials, how does a game that really only lasts a little less or over an hour take up 3 or more hours or programming, that's way too much. I want to see a real sport, a continious sport, not something being stopped every minute, I want it to be continued, no commercials until half-time.    3. It's all about the coaches, the quarterbacks have the plays with them at all times, a coach basically makes up the game his team is playing, the players have to go by a specific play.    4. The extra protection they use, if it's considered to be the "man's game" in the United States, why does it need all that protection? You want a sense of seeing who your idol is, anyone in here might recognize who Ronaldinho is by his style of play, his moves, in Tackleball, all you see is a man with too much pads wearing a helmet, his jersey number and name on the back, you don't really get a sense of who your idol is, unless it's at a press conference or an interview.    There's more, but these are 4 of the things I dislike about Tackleball. People can like it, it's all about liking something, I dislike it, I don't find a sense to it, no point to me. But that's just my opinion, just like some people like Football, some people don't. Just like some people like Tackleball, some don't, I simply don't.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Huh?    My family are american football fanatics (Chargers/Cowboys rivalry going on.)    But everybody agrees with Chivas for futbol!|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Its a bad azz sport to play dude. I dont watch it that regularly. I mostly see all the highlights in Sportscenter|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	i like american football..go cowboys!.....i just like FUTBOL way better|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	I will only watch maybe College Football    but why dont I like American Football?    1. Americans think its the best and most popular sport in the world, which is not, its Football, Futbol, Calcio, Soccer etc.    2. The game stops ever 15-20 seconds.    3. Supposed to be a contact/impact sport but there are flag for "holding" or "pass interferance"    4. All the padding they use...you want a real contact sport, NFL fans should watch Rugby.    5. Some players get payed millions for playing like 15% of the whole game.    6. Like every other American sport, when they win a championship, they call them "World Champions" wen they only played in the US.    7. The Superbowl is overrated.    8. Like 60 commercials per game.    9. If its such a good sport, why isnt there "Football" in the Olympics.    10. The name! why the hell is it called FOOTball, they should call it Tackleball, Handball, Running with Ball, or Overweight "Athelets" Ball haha...    FUTBOL THE BEST SPORT IN THE WORLD|`|Jqlfj74Oaa	no tradition, no passion, not exciting, predictable, boring....|`|WCf9V0ZNaa	wtf r u talking about...    just by looking at ur display name gets me mad...lol|`|8zgFyfibaa	1. Because the real name should be called handball, not football you rarely use your feet.    2.other countries don't like it because its boring you take breaks every 10 or 15 seconds. And if you do remember the was the nfl europe but it sucked no one went to the games. The nfl just wasted its time by doing that.    3.american football thinks they are better than soccer players.     4.I don't like watching footbal players touching on each other (lol)    5.the superbowl. Americans say its the best final in the world. Lol its funny because no one outside the usa watches it.    Overall,american football won't ever be as popular as football/soccer because its a better sport. Its harder to balance a ball with your legs than your hands.   You have to stay fit in order to play soccer. Not big and fat.    Edit:ticallion I agree with you americans call every championship world champs. In baseball they call it the worls series. Superbowl they think its better than thw fifa world cup.  Etc.........    American football sucks. Americans say soccer is for losers.but fact is since they dint invent it they think it sucks hahaha|`|Lu7GJnsXaa	cause they play slow and arnt good..    [[2 points!]]|`|SvNcWfdJaa	its ok but its way overrated!|`|aNnmH3R4aa	For me....Soccer aka Football is the best sport in the world and my favorite sport.      But Football aka American Football....comes at a close 2nd!      I saw alot of answers and I agree with some and disagree with some.  I do agree that they make it sound like football is the best sport in the world and yet its only followed in the states and Superbowl sunday becomes a national holiday.  But you got to admit that the sport is picking up!  Now they are bringing one game of the regular season to England.  Remember a few years back when the Cardinals played against the 49ers en el Azteca?  The NFL is trying to bring up the world wide popularity and little by little....it is working!     I for one....played both sports!  I know the rules and I understand the game.  I understand why they call pass interference or roughing the passer for example!  For me....American football is my second fav sport and to be honest......American football was the first sport I liked way before soccer.      GO 49ers!|`|HVE2kX6Raa	I am an American and do enjoy football (Patriots got screwed this year, but what ever), but there are many reasons why it isn't worldly popular. It is a complicated game to most 3rd world countries. 6 pts for a touchdown, then an extra point. safeties, punts, interceptions. Imagine if you were born in a different country and came to USA and saw a football game for the first time. You would have no idea what was going on. You would know all about the REAL football (soccer), because it is a much easier sport to understand. It is much more challenging and diverse to play it than football is. A really fast person and a really big person can play football with great success. That is not the case in soccer. You run on average 7 miles a game and are always moving. Football players probably don't run that in a week. Practices are very difficult and challenging. I played soccer for 14 years and now coach it. American football is too hyped up for a sport that takes less skill than people know. If they didn't rip on futbol (soccer) players and have the mentality that they are the greatest athletes in the world, then the sport may be somewhat popular outside the US. Sadly, this is not the case. On average 45 million people watch the super bowl, 2 Billion watch the World Cup. The World Cup is the only true World championship. And Soccer is the only true football.|`|DO7nz8aRaa	Because its so boring to watch|`|qbPbvLuLaa	It's not that I hate it, it's just I don't have time to watch american football because I'm watching real football.|`|ErraTHpWaa	Its Retarded.They copied the name of football from us.Soccer was called footballfirst..its retarded.

mG2BCZe7aa	No more... Since the Lakers lost the 2008 Finals, I think the issue cooled off It's now mainly LeBron vs. Kobe, which is more apt, since they are probably two of the best in this era and since comparing Kobe to Jordan in different eras and situation creates biases on each side, although some users (Alpha Wolf in particular) still brings up the dead issue.

51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Nothing.  On ESPN Radio one of the commentators said he called the person at Disney who arranges that promotion.  She was pleasantly surprised with Bruce's declaration.|`|p7f5SEIwaa	I doubt Disney gave him any money i think he said that as football fan because he also said at the beginning to put down the guacamole and put down the chicken finger so I think he said it as a fan.|`|77pfOpLFaa	I don't think he got paid.

Goodel wanted the Steelers to win.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	not me.|`|7V79OMMHaa	I do, but there is also the fact that even if I didn't that wouldn't change the fact that the Steelers are the national Champions, are the best team in the NFL, and will have the 32nd pick in the next NFL draft. Unlike these bandwagon Cardinals clowns, I understand that.      Stay Cool|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	I think Harrison should have gotten booted from the game.|`|7InY2vuraa	they won fair and square. everyone is entitled to their opinions, even the cardinal fans. steeler fans are going to say yes. cardinal fans are going to say no.|`|aOx2hovgaa	i think it was fair.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I do.

Every game has missed calls and some controversy.  There are just too many players on the field for the officiating team to watch at all times.  It's just another part/factor of the game.    *Danny* AGAIN, CHECK THE RULE BOOK. EVERY SINGLE PLAY IS REVIEWED BY THE BOOTH. IF THEY HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME TO COME TO A DEFINITE SOLUTION ON ANY GIVEN PLAY THEY WILL CALL FOR A TIME OUT ON THE FIELD TO FURTHER REVIEW THE PLAY AND LET THE FIELD OFFICIAL VIEW THE PLAY AS WELL. THE PLAY WAS REVIEWED JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER PLAY AFTER THE 2 MINUTE MARK.      do you even realize how much time the booth had to look at the replay after the play????? The Steelers all went crazy and the officials took enough time to call and announce a penalty on Woodley for taking off his helmet AND after that the Steelers offense and Cardinals defense had to take the field......thats a lot of time for review. So, before you call anyone an idiot just check the facts.  I wasn't trying to bash you, I was just giving you a heads up so you don't look like a complete *** somewhere else.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	They won fair and square.    http://americanfootballpositions.blogspo...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|SoyiS9IKaa	There were some bad calls but the Arizona defense really didn't show up when it counted.  I think they might of been a little nervous being in the SB.|`|NzGZbCRQaa	Danny Fantom,    The play was reviewed during the commercial break and easily determined to be correctly called as a fumble. No need to drag it out for ten minutes when it was an obvious fumble.|`|369daff84a41e52e1e818e6cb9fc5724aa	How about the holding/tackle/throwing to the ground of Curt Warner when he tried to tackle that cheapshot two fisted linebacker.|`|WHot3QXMaa	The Steelers won and if it weren't for that stupid prevent Defense they would have won by alot larger of a margin....

How did they not eject James Harrison or call for Delay of Game on at least 1 critical occassion..I think Ike Taylor got away a couplt times with some physical play on Fitz - but credit to him he played awesome...    I think its a trend that the games best WR doesnt win their first time in the SB...TO in 05, Ran' in 07 and now Fitz...|`|grXlq18Caa	I do, they played very well.  Executed the pass down field a consistent number of times.  They deserve that win!|`|rnH9NnZRaa	I think they won fair and square.  If the fix was in then the Cards would not have come 2 minutes and 37 seconds away from winning the Lombardi|`|fz77R5Jmaa	i think they won fair and square|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	They won it fairly. There were questionable calls either way. And if people are going to complain about the last review being a non review, I think that any person could see that was watching that the ball was moving.     And for those that think that Harrison should have been thrown out, look at the fights that happened during the regular season, those players weren't thrown out. Get over it. Im sorry but if someone tries to take out your knees, when the ball is down at the other end of the field, you tell me you wouldn't lose your cool!  I've seen WORSE personal fouls that didn't even get a flag thrown.   Not to mention it gave the Cards two points when there wasn't even holding. The defender fell on top of our guy,.     Or what about when Troy got held on a play that set up a big play for the Cards?|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	Being an aussie i dont really care who won or lost.  I dont even really get the whole game but I was hoping that the Cardinals would do it because of Ben Graham (go aussies).|`|OW1pCxU1aa	Well one thing is for certain - that last play should have been reviewed.  Whether you have an opinion about whether or not it was a fumble doesnt matter.  If it is questionable at the slightest margin, you HAVE to review.  Horrible officiating on that play.  The review committee should all be fired for that one.  You dont NOT REVIEW a questionable play on the LAST PLAY of the SUPERBOWL!!  Ridiculous.  I dont care either way who wins, and the outcome most likely doesnt change, but you have to review that play.  The NFL needs to get that much right.  If I was the Arizona coaches, I would be justifiably pissed.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	They won. Life goes on.|`|HAVLq7IMaa	Oh heck yes we did. I don't think anyone realizes just how crazy we went when they won. Pittsburgh was literally ablaze and it was awesome!

nvzgUbgAaa	Fitz on specific routes and throws (jump balls, shielding his defender w/ his size, etc).  Prime wins on routes requiring separation.    although, have you seen sanders play?  he always shied away from nitty gritty tackling (whenever he could).  don't get me wrong, he did tackle, but his tackling (and body language) preferred not to.      as an OC, i would've softened him up w/ outside runs for much of the game towards his side, w/ pulling guards and nasty FBs.  after all those body blows, i'd goto the head w/ a double move.    when he's fresh, he was always ON.  i just didn't see enough of teams & OCs going after him in other facets of the game.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	That would be an awesome match up. Deion was prob the best cover corner I have ever seen. Going to say Deion wins that match up 6 out of 10 times.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	Well if a QB throws a jump ball, Fitz is coming down with it. If the QB throws a a streak down the field, Deion will outrun Fitz and make the play.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	neon deion, lol|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Deion was much faster, so he could outrun him to the ball.  Fitz is a little taller though, so he could probably win some jump balls.    Depends who the quarterback is then. Deion has an advantage against young strong-armed quarterbacks, but with a veteran quarterback I'd give the edge to Fitz.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Deion Sanders is old now... Larry Fitzgerald would run circles around him.  If you are referring to Deion in his prime (which I'm sure you are), then I still believe Fitz would win the battle.  That man is tall, he's got long arms, meat hooks that can hold on to anything it seems, and he can out jump just about everyone in the NFL... with all that said, Larry Fitzgerald hands down.|`|yg3Pveakaa	This is one hell of a match up, when you say shutdown corner, Deion Sanders comes to my mind and when you ask the best Wideout in the NFL, Larry Fitzgerald. But i think the winner will defend on the QB, Deion is one of the worst problem of QBs and when he gets in the guys head he's throw even if it was Fitz will be a PICK SIX for him..|`|yuGhmhGuaa	Larry Fitzgerald,no doubt|`|e6RZX7Xzaa	Larry Fitzgerald most likely.|`|B6dQzaGyaa	Sanders was the greatest cover corner of all time, in his prime he would own Fitz just like he did every other WR in his day. what made him good was his size to go with that speed (about 6'1 1/2"). Deion covered Irvin and Rice and Fitz is not in their league yet...so Neon wins most of those battles...but here is the key, would the OC of the team Fitz was on actually throw at Deion, not many others did, no matter who the WR was!!    *ME* you say that you dont know if Deion was much faster then Fitz...put down the crack pipe and step away, Deion was one of the fastest NFL players ever and was clocked at sub 4.25 almost every run he ever had, Fitz fastest is listed in mid 4.5s, its not a contest, Deion would out run him with a 50lbs weight in his pocket!!|`|MPDgKgIxaa	Deion Sanders    http://americanfootballpositions.blogspo...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|46Mxaw13aa	deion is too fast he will lock up fitzgerald 6 out of 10 times on a streak but if you throw it up for grabsfitzgerald has the sickest hops and hands around|`|ZCzAhuafaa	if they lob it up fitz would own him every time|`|SoyiS9IKaa	Deion in his prime for sure.  Deion was a bad tackler though.  He was afraid to hit.  Besides that he owned alot the WR's he went up against.|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Hard to say because the WR's today are bigger, stronger and faster.  That being said, if they were from the same era based on just skill, I would say Deion.  Deion was so good, that QBs avoided even throwing in his direction.  I've never seen that ever happen before with ANY QB except Deion.  Even the great Jerry Rice was put in motion due to Deion covering him.  There was only one matchup that gave Deion a hint of a challenge, and that was Michael Irvin.  Irvin was good at getting his body between the defender and the ball.  But really, even Irvin didn't beat Deion.  Rice did somewhat ok (not as well as Irvin), but again did not beat Deion.  Nobody really beat Deion.|`|369daff84a41e52e1e818e6cb9fc5724aa	Larry you have to go with youth.|`|2mbiQfSmaa	Fitzgerald.  They throw anything his direction he is gonna catch it. I personally think he is a jerry rice like talent and if he gets on the right team or the cardinals can somehow continue to win, he will go down in history as one of the greatest ever.     Also i think if they had thrown a fade to the corner to fitzgerald at the end of the first half instead of that quick slant that got picked off and ran back the cards win. But that is not how it went down oh well.    i know deion was quick but i don't know if he was that much faster than fitzgerald.  I think it would be a closer foot race than most think|`|df1cca06887480a5dfed386bc1649768aa	hopefully Fitzgerald won't let it go to his head but definitely Fitzgerald  but Deion could run like hell too!!|`|9944787f7b97209854b4040a6d619d15aa	deion, only because he played both ways, but larry is a much better WR than deion was.|`|mMLDctjlaa	Deion is the BEST shut down corner ever hands down, the teams he played for would put him on the other teams best WR man to man and they play zone everywhere else cuz they knew the other team wouldnt throw his way.    Fitzgerald isnt even the close to being in the top 10 WR of all time, hell he really didnt do much in the superbowl minus that HUGE catch he had.    Prime time would have made Fitz his B**ch belive that.|`|ar4JGfzjaa	Good question!   Everyone touched on some good points. Deion is faster, and a great shutdown CB. Fitz is a young WR with a lot of room for improvement. He is however bigger and stronger than Deion. So if it's man to man coverage I have to give Deion the most wins. However, if Fitz has the ball and Deion has to tackle him, I go with Fitz winning moat of the time. Deion's weakness was his ability to deliver a hit. And we know Fitz is hard to tackle. That's what I think.

aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	no way to tell who's better, but i know moreno was better than he played since his o-line kept getting hurt and so they just had to throw guys in there in front of him....     depends on what's going on with tomlinson... moreno would be great to replace him if he leaves (style, size, cuts, rb-pass reciever)...     whereas wells can pound it inside with that weight (and he can catch too)..    maluga would be good too, but i think until you find out about tomlinson, and sproles, you're fine at RB    i'd put my money on Raji, honestly.. i know D isn't glamorous.. but you need it.|`|B6dQzaGyaa	Maualuga is nothing like Merriman, Merriman is an OLB that is great off the corner blitzing, Rey is a pure MLB so nice try, but not even close    I would expect them to go MLB, in order to get a run stuffer in the middle Laurinaits may be an option at their pick (faster then Rey for the 3-4 scheme but not as strong), however I would think they make look at a young OL like Robinson from OU to replace Goff and take the age of their OL down to one of the younger in the league, and Goff is rumored to be gone. They may also look at upgrading the OT with a guy like Smith from Baylor to play the right side.    Dont think they waste a pick on a RB in the first round to be honest, if they were to go that route, they could resign Sproles for alot less then a 1st round RB, and they have Hester as a power back as well.|`|ELcEOOWTaa	I don't think you can go HORRIBLY wrong either way. By that I mean I believe that both backs will be solid NFL backs. Wells has shown himself to be somewhat of an injury risk, alot of little nagging injuries during his career. However, alot of experts said the same about Adrian Peterson when he came out. Other than that, I really can't knock anything about the guy. He's got size, speed, hands are definitely iffy, but that can be helped with good coaching. Knowshon is an explosive hard runner. He's got great open field speed. He's also probably got the better hands of the two which some personnel people value. I'm more of a proponent for big backs because I think they hold up better over the long haul. For example, I loveddd Jonathan Stewart last year, because of his size, speed, hands, etc. I think Beanie would probably be the better fit with the Chargers anyway. A big guy that can get those short yards to offset LT's explosiveness. That's assuming he can work his way back to 100%. Knowshon actually kind of reminds me of LT a little bit. So if you're looking for an eventual replacement, then maybe Know is the better choice. If I was forced to take one, I'd probably go mad because I like them both.|`|S8Mr6xsfaa	BEANIE BEANIE BEANIE GO OSU|`|WHot3QXMaa	I think you would rather have Moreno. He plays in a tougher conference against teams that are known for tough defenses such as LSU, Florida, Auburn, and Alabama this year....

Very athletic power runner, deceptive speed, but takes a while to accelerate to full speed, and doesn't have great hands.    Moreno is somewhat the opposite. Sees the whole field, makes quick moves, has good hands, but he's not very fast in the open field, and a little on the small side (about Brian Westbrook's size).    I think Moreno might be more NFL-ready, but Wells might have more potential.|`|rnH9NnZRaa	I think the Chargers should worry about getting a premier WR to go along with Chamber and Gates

B6dQzaGyaa	QB hands down no doubt about it, why do you think there is a shortage of quality NFL starters at it? There is no position in the NFL that has worse record for busts then the QB position just because what is asked for a QB on every play, you are the equivalent of a coach that has to actually play as well.    Single play the QB has the following jobs (on passing play):    1. Call the play  2. Read the D  3. Call an audible and point out blitz package to RBs and OL  4. Shift formation if need be  5. Look to WRs to acknowledge coverage and hot route if need be  6. Take the snap and make a read while moving  7. Recognize a blitz and hit a hot route if need be  8. If no blitz then start your progression of reads  9. Recognize an open WR while still be able to see the field for LBs in mid zones or a safety reading your eyes  10. Still being aware of the pass rush  11. Make an accurate throw     Hands down QB|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Quarterback    You control the offense and you are pretty much the leader of the team.  You have to be aware of your surroundings at all times as well as your recievers.|`|j145Rih1aa	QB is the toughest. I am High School defensive coordinator and I still say QB.    They are the Coaches on the field.      All in a few seconds they have to call the play in the huddle, make sure EVERYONE is lined up right, read the D, make adjustments, take the snap while reading the D again, know exactly what route or Pass pro they have, and then either find the open man or hand off. BY FAR the hardest|`|46Mxaw13aa	center is the toughest you are coordinating the whole running game and watching the defenders formations and blitzs not to mention that you may have to make a sudden call if the defense creeps up in a certain gap and throws your runnin play off..... you would then have to check on the line and make a call to your o line to switch their assignments and if it happens too fast and u cant check you have to trust your teammates saw it and will change their assignements without u telling them so....andnot to mention as an offensive linemen u cany hold or grab jerseybut the defense can grab and throw u away from their body if u can dominate a good defensive linemen who will grab throw and toss u by graqbbing hold of your jersey or pads then ur skilled thats why i say a really good offensive linemen is an amazing athlete.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	QuarterBack    http://americanfootballpositions.blogspo...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|yg3Pveakaa	QB, everything runs through you and a little blunder on your part can cause the game.. American football is partly about execution, and with a great QB a team can excel through most games without any problems.|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	I like to say QB, but I am going to go against the grain here.     I think that this position is not the toughest but requires the most skill, that position is CB because when covering a receiver it is all reaction. There is a lot of change of direction and quick reactions. In a zone, it is hard to keep ground or make decisions when teams put multiple receivers in one zone. Then in man to man there is always the fret of pass interference. And CBs are usually the smallest people on the field, that's why Deion perfected the tackle at the knees. Now offensive guys just hurdle that =D    But toughest is probably QB, I have seen our QBs body the sunday after a game, and his pads are smaller for the throwing motion.|`|gBfPkdroaa	well i believe MOSTLY everyone is gonna say QB. so on the defense ll say Safety.    Strong Safety or Free you have to know when your drop back for a pass, go after the HB if its a run play, play some deep zone, blitz, stuff like that.    i understand people might say a Linebacker isnt really that different but still, a safety isnt 6'0 200+ lbs.      i would hate to play as a Safety.    but those who success it, make a definite impact on their teams defense.

Ed reed, Troy Polamalu, Bob Sanders etc.|`|ZCzAhuafaa	qb|`|9944787f7b97209854b4040a6d619d15aa	kicker    you do kick-offs and extra-points. then they throw the game in your lap after you were sipping gatorade all game and talking about the girl last night that said you were cute. after that you have to worry about the other guys in the locker room giving you wedgie.    haha just playing. quaterback no doubt.

q3E24CPjaa	I think it's the Penguins. The Ducks have talent on the blue line, at center and on the wings. They will make it into the playoffs and have as good a chance as anyone after that. The Penguins are a helicopter - no wings. Petr Sykora is the only one making any real contribution and there are no prospects waiting to make an impact. They desparately need a big forward with at least alittle scoring touch. I don't think the cap will allow them to make a big move, but they need it badly. Second choice: Dallas. This team really doesn't have an identity. They're solid, but have no stars except the aging Modano and Zubov. Brad Richards is a nice player, but they really need a true goal scorer and Neal is a rookie. I can't remember the last time a team won the Cup without a genuine star on their roster.|`|Icze35Nqaa	The Ducks could be sellers at the end of February, I guess it depends on their standing at the end of the month.

Though, it's best you consult your school that you're in danger.         Here is what you do when you get pushed down. (Ignore the side advertisements.... they're all fanboy base)     http://www.comegetyousome.com/video/1765...    That link I sent you is very important. As it explains, when you fall properly and get into that position you can easily strike her knees or face. Practice it at home, it's simple and easy.    Another thing. She is BIG right? That means her knees are going to week, so if you can, kick them in with your heel.    Another self defense tactic.. this will be easy for you.     Grab. Twist. Pull.    Think of it like your hair brush. There's hair right? Grab her hair twist it as tight as you can, pull her down and do knees to face. When you do knees, point your toes and swing in hard with full force.    When she's on the ground, stomp the face. Run.    Self-defense, right? Don't fall in with her and start mounting her and punching her. Just walk away after you've done some damage.    Also.... if she grabs you. Box the ears. That means use two of your hands (palm) spread your arms wide open and clap the ears. This will make her eardrums sing.    Palm strike to nose.    Well, dangerous information I'm giving you. It all depends how you use it. Let me know how you do.     Cheers.|`|8e92840faf3c865ae5b9e2addd58c913aa	Punch her in the boobs really hard.  or call an adult(I'm assuming you're a minor)  if you didn't provoke anything, I don't see any problem getting help.|`|M9e8ilbiaa	Mmmm... girl street fights are always dirtier than boys fight. Id like to suggest to aply something to your hair in order to avoid being grabbed by there. I dont know, it could be gel, cream, whatever it makes slippery.    Second, on the fight, grab her hair with both hands and push her head down to the floor. Keep pushing her head down while you punch or knee her face. If she falls to the floor, try to get on top.    In case you fall under her, always try to tear her clothes. Thatll stop her attack.    Finally, avoid earrings, necklaces, and long nails.     If you have to fight, do the most possible damage; but always try to find another kind of solution. Centainly youll be tagged by a couple of punches, even if you win.

lkw5ZyDIaa	Austin was Stunning Steve Austin in AWA in the late eighties and early nineties. Then he went to WCW where he teamed up with Brian Pillman as the Hollywood Blondes. In 1994 or 1995, he was fired from WCW. He went to work for ECW as "Superstar" Steve Williams. At ECW, he spent countless hours ridiculing WCW. Vince then hired him in 1996 as "The Ringmaster." He was manged by Ted Debiase. After Ted went to WCW to join the NWO, Steve created the Stone Cold Steve Austin gimmick. This was in 1996|`|Y3O8cW8Kaa	1936.|`|QQyWUDI8aa	well lets think     Austin debuted in World Championship Wrestling in 1991 as "Stunning" Steve Austin, initially managed by Vivacious Veronica. Almost immediately after Austin's debut, Lady Blossom became his valet. Austin defeated Bobby Eaton for the WCW World Television Championship on June 3, 1991, just weeks after his debut. In late 1991, Austin joined Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance. Austin lost the WCW Television Championship to Barry Windham in a two out of three falls match on April 27, 1992. He regained the title from Windham on May 23, 1992. He enjoyed a second lengthy reign before losing to Ricky Steamboat on September 2, 1992. The Dangerous Alliance disbanded shortly thereafter. At Halloween Havoc, he replaced Terry Gordy, teaming with "Dr. Death" Steve Williams to wrestle Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham for the unified WCW and NWA World Tag Team titles. The pair wrestled to a thirty minute time limit draw.    In January 1993, Austin formed a tag team with Brian Pillman known as the Hollywood Blonds. The Blonds won the WCW World Tag Team Championship on March 3, 1993, defeating Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas. The Hollywood Blonds held the titles for five months. At Clash of the Champions XXIII the Blonds faced Ric Flair and Arn Anderson in a two out of three falls tag team title match. Flair and Anderson defeated the Blonds, but were not awarded the titles as one fall had been determined by a disqualification.    At Clash of the Champions XXIV, Austin and Pillman were scheduled to defend the titles against Arn Anderson and his new partner, Paul Roma. An injured Pillman, however, was replaced by Steven Regal. Austin and Regal lost to Anderson and Roma. With Pillman still injured, Austin then joined Colonel Robert Parker's Stud Stable. After Pillman returned, Austin betrayed and defeated him in a singles bout at Clash of the Champions XXV.    At Starrcade 1993, in a two out of three falls match, Austin defeated Dustin Rhodes in two straight falls to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Ricky Steamboat on August 24, 1994. Austin was scheduled to face Steamboat in a rematch for the title at Fall Brawl, but Steamboat was unable to wrestle due to a back injury, and Austin was awarded the title by forfeit. His second reign ended just minutes later when he lost to Steamboat's replacement, Jim Duggan in a match that lasted thirty-five seconds.Austin then challenged Duggan for the United States Championship at Halloween Havoc 1994 and Clash of the Champions XXIX. On both occasions, Austin lost to Duggan by disqualification..After returning from his knee injury in early 1995, he took part in a tournament for the vacant WCW United States Heavyweight title, where he defeated Duggan in the first round, but lost to Randy Savage in the quarterfinals.      when he started the WWE/F was 1995 but in WCW he started 1989     his real name is Steven Williams  born on December 18, 1964.|`|rs7fuvPxaa	1991|`|4g2Kjerdaa	some where around the 1980s|`|AA12188318	WCW - 1991  ECW - 1995  WWF/WWE - 1995|`|2b69d3273c89d3075ffe70337e541813aa	Stone Cold made his debut May 11, 1989|`|H3nbC71eaa	Stonecold, known by his real name when he debuted, Steve Williams...he debuted in 1989 in WCCW in Dallas.

He was Stunning Steve Austin later on in WCCW and then when he went to WCW. He then appeared in ECW for a short time as Superstar Steve Austin. He went to the WWF as The Ringmaster and finally became Stonecold in the mid 90's.

QB!!!!!!!! ... Bill Wade played a good season for the '63 Champ Bears ... McMahon did it for them in '85. We're talking 2 good seasons at QB in 45 years!  Terry Bradshaw went in the 7th round (I believe)  How did the Cards get Warner? NO stole Brees ... Look, when management gives their first priority to the most important position they can finagle their draft to either move up or trade for an established NFL QB.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	WR would make sense, maybe Darrius Heyward-Bey from Maryland. They should probably draft a quarterback at some point though.    I'd be very surprised if Mark Sanchez falls past the Jets, who pick right in front of the Bears, but there may be some good quarterbacks later on in the draft. I think Josh Freeman of Kansas State could be a huge sleeper.|`|g5wninniaa	QB...its always there problem...maybe even trade it....for McNabb!

YiFwUJZkaa	It all depends on how good the player is and whether you're sure you want them or not. If a club was after a particular player who they'ed been chasing for a while and really wanted him they would probably buy him because then the player is theirs and theirs only not shared.    Clubs usually rent a player on loan if they need to fill in a position because a regular is injured or if they want that player for a certain ammount of time so they can kind of trial them. Although, sometimes clubs might loan their players out because the player might not be happy but their club want them to remain with them.     Its quite handy to loan players because if they arent what the club wanted then they can send them back just like what Liverpool did with Robbie Kean, it probably would've taken far more stuffing around to have him put on the transfer market and for Liverpool to agree to a price with another club.    The bad thing about a loan is that if a player is in top form and their loan is up, they have to leave the club leaving them with a huge gap to fill in most cases. This could be good or bad depending on which way you look at it|`|HNevzfOuaa	YA think rent football players is better than buying them  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://tvviainternetsatelite.blogspot.co...|`|gz2M5hsBaa	Not always. A club could buy a reasonably cheap player who could end up becoming one of the world's best.
YiFwUJZkaa	The closest thing to this is probably a transfer. I'm sure it probably has been done in some dodgy leagues in south america or a place like that. The reason why they don't do this is that even though clubs would be getting a players to replace players, they wouldnt be recieving the money for transfers that they depend on. Some of your ideas are good but some of the time your loosing two players and only getting one back, that means a club is out of pocket because they have to buy another player.|`|YHeTQNpFaa	Nope!! Only in the SORRY *** MLS!!!!

Kent, maybe, but he's no lock.      Down the road, Bonds and Clemens will get in.  Their long term dominance, and we're pretty sure Barry was on his way before he ever touched the stuff, maybe Roger too, will get them in.

8w5ts361aa	It'll do fine, you can ride a bmx for 5 miles without much difficulty and your body may even get used to it after a few trips.    But if this routine lasts a while, do consider these differences when riding on a bmx compared to a mountainbike or a geared city/commuter bike:     1) You will be travelling slower with similar effort;  2) You may struggle on uphills;  3) You may not get as comfortable a riding position as on a larger bike;  4) Normally not many options for carrying cargo on a bmx (racks, baskets, etc).  5) Slightly less visible to drivers in urban traffic as you are lower and smaller. You will similary also be able to see less.    Just remember to wear a helmet, install a loud bell, wear bright clothing and install front and rear lights if you have to ride in low light or darkness. Have fun, stay safe!|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Its fine. Im 6'3 and ride a normal size bmx. The only advantages to Mountain bike are ride height and gears.|`|HGfUY3lbaa	for longer rides go mtb cause i use to ride my bmx bike for over 30 miles and it cause back problems. bmx bikes are made for tricks and short distances. mtb you can change gears so it makes it way better|`|dZrLotpgaa	Yes, Wear a Helmet|`|Fqb5ZJUuaa	For longer bike rides, multi-speed bikes are the way to go.  You can get a smaller mountain bike to fit you.|`|os1ws4wIaa	obviously it will.... height dont matter at all.. happy riding|`|Q7XbsoJAaa	Yes this will be fine for a beginner, but if you need to go up hills/mountains a mountain bike is the go, and for longer bike rides a road bike will do the trick being able to reach higher speeds with thin slick tires they work really well, and if you wanna get even better you might want to consider purchasing some tight pants and shirt as these reduce air friction, you would also need to take a drink bottle, if you do buy a road bike i recommend that you buy pedals that actually clip to your shoes, this also makes a ride easier.    I hope this helps!    P.S: Always wear a helmet.|`|8nr41VQ2aa	well it depends on what you are looking for. if its comfort then i would suggest going with a mountain bike or a terrain bike, but if its agility and trust me you'l need it to try to avoid all the cars lol. then i would stick with the BMX. Oh and as for 5'6" thats a fine height for BMXing as most pros are below 5'10".   : )
32la4VGEaa	no not at all! =D  my sis lil boy is 3yrs and she took him, he loved it.|`|AA11401067	No way, if she wants to try and there are others her age to skate with. If she doesn't feel like skating at first, and she can just watch with people you trust and she likes, she will still admire your ability and probably want to give it a try later, and still appreciate the hot chocolate & the atmosphere & enthusiasm of others around.     She is a bit young if you can only go if you are both ready to take to the ice. If you have no one else to keep her company while you get some skating time, that could be bleak for her. Maybe you have a friend who loves children and skating, but can't skate right now and would come to keep her company if she isn't keen right away?|`|GvnQESq6aa	Not at all.  My daughter began skating at 4 and competing at 5.  Make sure your child has fun on the ice.  You can start taking private lessons at this time too.  Make sure you have an enthusiastic coach who has patience with young children.  This is the time to research figure skating.  It is a sport you can enjoy with your child.  Take a "Mommy and Me" ice skating class.  Some rinks have classes during the day.  Make it a family outing and include Dad as well.  The younger the child less is the fear of falling; they are closer to the ground.  The U.S.F.S. has Basic Skills classes and competitions for beginnners. Check out U.S.F.S.A.org online.  Spring is a good time to go to a local ice show.  This year our rink is having Evan Lysacek as their guest skater.  Hundreds of skaters take to the ice to be in shows all over the country not just professional shows.  They are inexpensive to watch.  Soon your child can be in one of these; they are for all levels.|`|zB5mWsmgaa	well i started at 6 but my sister started at 4 so i guess its ok. shes 8 now and can do some double jumps earlier than me ( i got them when i was 10).|`|2JSIKsP7aa	if you want a daughter with a broken spine then yes go ahead and take her.

But I think you should be careful if you do take her, try and take her on a weekday when there won't be many people there to ensure she doesn't get hurt, some ice-skaters can be a little selfish.|`|bvnzv923aa	No, it is not too young. Most really good skaters start at a young age. This way your daughter has more time. Once you reach the point where you're a young adult, you physically stop advancing in skating. The more time that she has, the better chance she has of being really good. *I am not saying that she will for sure be an olympian, but there is a better chance of her reaching that level when she starts younger. Just make sure she has a choice in doing it. Do not force her to skate. If she doesn't want to, then she doesn't want to.|`|3y8YIs3raa	my sister started when she was 4 shes 6 now shes pretty good   it depends weather she wants to   and if you mean just as a trip out then yeah get her to watch dancing on ice to get her in the mood you can get special 2 bladed skates as well :]|`|E05LFRhaaa	nope,its a great age! at my club there are a bunch of canskaters that are 4, just make sure that they are having fun and not being forced into it cause then they won't want to do it...but put them into a beginners program,then private lessons after that,soon they can star compeating if thats what they want,i started skating at 6 but i was forced to do it so it wasn't fun but after a few years i went back and i have been skating now for 6 years and competing for 5,and i luv it !and my bff from skating started canskate when she was 4 and now shes landing dobles,and shes in the competitive stream,and right now shes 9...but like i said MAKE SURE THEY LIKE IT!!!but i hope tat it all works out best of luck!=]|`|TKHA5okpaa	No it's not too young to learn to iceskate,  But if you have your heart set on more than that you should relax a bit and dont set her up on any expensive training or anything just yet.   But if you want your child to be good at anything you do have to start em young.  4 years old is perfect for an indroduction.|`|AA12318686	When we were kids we had ice skates with double blades on them, which makes them alot more stable, so that we wouldn't fall as easily.  I would bundle her up so that she's warm enough and take her. But you must be with her at all times so that she is safe. She might enjoy skating alot.

nBqZBbtnaa	You people need to shut your mouths, you're all hypocrites. Everyone knows when someone is shooting like that, OVER 60%, you feed him the ball and ride the streak. Confidence is everything in this game. Bynum had a similar game vs the Clippers a while ago, where he shot over 70%, guess what, they kept giving him the ball. You're retarded if you think Kobe or Bynum should give up the ball when he is playing like that. He just has so many of those games so you think he's a ball-hog, wake up, you're pathetic.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	he's great player!    yes he's a ball hog but good ball hog!|`|WYMsOPOhaa	Kobe had an outstanding night.|`|AA11488609	Yes, but that is his role, to score and attract the defense.

He is One of the Biggest Ballhogs in the NBA.|`|i5MInqeMaa	The sad thing about this is that he had to do this to keep the lakers in the game against the knicks.  You would think a kobe 61point and gasol 31 would be good enough, but the kicks stayed into the game up to the 5 or 6 min mark of the 4th.  Lakers are in trouble if kobe has to do this everynight.|`|v77SnunOaa	KOBE PLAYS GREAT AGAINST TERRIBLE TEAMS!!!!

But it's crazy when the "haters" can not acknowledge a great game for what it is.  Kobe was phenomenal tonight and deserves all the praise that he gets.  One game doesn't prove everything- but this also isn't the first time we've seen this from him.  He's an incredible talent and he was very efficient today...  Great game for Kobe and for the Lakers and as he said in the post-game it was a much needed win especially after the loss of Bynum- it helped the Lakers re-focus which is crucial on a 6 game road trip.  Hopefully he will continue to score but in an efficient way- and as Stu Lantz said in his post-game analysis- this may lead to some big assist games as other teams begin to double team and daring his teammates to make shots. Go Lakers!    Nickster|`|yg3Pveakaa	This is something I don't like about his game but I believe that he did this because he feels the defense can't guard him..There are times he is not in sync in a portion of a game but when he feels good like he did scoring 61 point I say it is very good and showing his out of this world talent..    He had evolve from a dunker, shooter, a great defender, and a passer and when you have all this things you are really one of the and can do anything in the basketball court.|`|PA0gmwd5aa	Not anymore.He said he felt good in the shootaround and it transpired into a good game for him.For years I couldn't stand him,but I think he gets it now.He can't do it alone,but tonight he picked up the slack Drew being out.Maybe Dick LaBeau could leave Steelers party and show Knicks how to play defense.|`|oMSTg5rQaa	No, he wasn't being a "ball hog".    The Knicks aren't very good defensively and he was red hot from the feild, so why not shoot it?    Kobe has had shooting games like 17-47, or 19-44...that's hoggin'.    Tonight wasn't one of those nights.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	No     Proof    He s Not Averaging  Points Like The lasts 2 seasons    He Had TRIPLE DOUBLES      He Gives More Assists Now|`|l2A2kCIPaa	hell yea! that should b his nickname lol|`|j6NImFHgaa	Well you said yourself no one else really had any shots falling, so what is the star of the team, and possibly the whole NBA, suppose to do? Just sit back and watch his team fall? No, so he did what he had to do and took over the game. But you know when the other team members are shooting well he shares the ball a lot more. So there you go, no ballhog here. He's just aware of his talented self, and he stepped up to the job.|`|HDK10qYZaa	yeah hes a ball hog  if hes on fire they win but if hes off his game they loose well not all the time but for the most part yeah if he just passed more they would be awsome.|`|Wov6xyaCaa	kobe is a ballhog but doesnt lakers fans wanted him to become 1?
FhHIAbmLaa	If Taurus gives you a specific weight and speed, stck to it.     Threre are a ton of factors to consider in these small light revolvers. They can become jammed up, or just  break with the wrong ammo.  Small light revolvers are also prone to ammo jumping crimp.     Go look into 38 special Plus p(short barrel) by Buffalo Bore, for that gun. You will keep pressure down, speed up, and shoot a better tachtical reload case.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	Yep, safe.    You need to be concerned with pressure, not velocity.  Pressure and velocity are totally unrelated.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Yes it is safe.      Your 124 grain bullet at 1498 fps will not generate as much chamber pressure as your maximum load of 158 grain bullet at 1450 fps.  The heavier 158 grain bullet takes a lot more force to accelerate than the lighter bullet.  The 124 grain bullet will be out of the barrel before chamber pressures get too high.
6gwx59Jtaa	I'd say probably Robbie Keane to Tottenham.  We already know he was a success there and can play in that system and works well with the rest of that team.  There is no reason why he shouldn't be able to succeed there since he was already a success there before.|`|GjpWEu6Raa	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA     SORRY IM LAUGHING MY FAT A** OFF    THE BEST BUY OF THE TRANSFER IS DEFFO       HESKEY     3.5 MILLION AND SCORED ON 21 MINS OF HIS DEBUT       QUALITY OR WHAT..!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Arshavin for sure|`|gpNIG15eaa	This season's January transfer window sucks so far.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	Quaresma on loan to Chelsea FC    that is by far the best deal|`|Hzzdalavaa	arsenil - two words, **** and nil, work it out.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	I agree with Thinesh.  It Sucks!|`|VsqOAOU3aa	gunning for Arshavin|`|r09Zfxrkaa	I reckon Arshavin is a strong possibilty if his transfer is confirmed. But Keane maybe as well, depending on how one of the world's most over-rated managers (Redknapp), slots him into the lineup at Tottenham.|`|OKgbeWe3aa	Hossam Ghaly! (Spurs to Nassr Saudi Club)    Surely he cant be hated where he is now?      In Premiership:   James Beattie for Stoke  I can see him having a relegation free season if he keeps scoring.|`|is0myvrHaa	hesky is wayyy past his years hell start to drop form soon..villa hav forwards better than him.  i say spurs getting cuddicini about time they got rid of gomes, he sucked.
oDZx9Vt2aa	1. Nothing is automatic.  Home court can only take you so far.    2. Points won by only shows that yes, Boston is a better team.  It is a fact that they have better player on their team, at least at the top end.  But that does not mean they will win the series.|`|9X1bQgY4aa	I think it's a combination.  Homecourt is obviously an advantage, but they also have the whole "nobody's giving us a chance" factor and all that.|`|0G4BYdloaa	What do you mean the Celtics can't play when it matters?    Did they not win tonight?    **** sakes. You Celtics haters are getting old as ****.    Jealousy kills.|`|t3fTSoiaaa	I think so|`|LBZdEZHTaa	nah be koo|`|ishPf2Glaa	Dont go by the amount won  by... A game won in the final seconds tells you alot about the abilities of the players to play under pressure...    If anything you just pointed out that the Celtics cant play when it matters....
2b2039f87a24493d348609af3cc01f39aa	I heard about this it is a tragedy. Him his wife and a 7 year old son. I am in shock! Their family that is left must feel the loss way more then I can explain. I will pray for them and the loved ones who passed away as well.|`|373fba0cbd5b1fc53f96a2dcd131fdffaa	Yes, I will miss Chris Benoit like Eddie Guerrero back in 2005 when he died of overdoesage. But for him to take his family down the path with him is very upseting.|`|lARHYGxTaa	It is very sad to see Chris Benoit go, just like it was so sad to see Davey Boy Smith go in 2002.    May their beautiful souls rest in the Heavens!!!!
YmV3TNTpaa	Cerezo just wanted to put the blame on someone. During the game against Valladolid the supporters were asking him to change the administration, not Aguirre. The president felt that he was doing something unfair so he traveled to Switzerland to call an executive in Dubai to contact Aguirre in Madrid asking him to leave. The Mexican was behind Atletico's comeback while dealing with injuries and stupid administrative actions that affected the squad's moral. They chose to take off the captaincy from Antonio Lopez after years with no apparent reason and give it to Maxi. They kept Maniche and Seitaridis after all the problems they created among the group. They're telling other players to play like Aguero.. All this have an exetremly negative impact on the players moral and consequently on their performances.    Replacing Javier Aguirre by a manager with one year of experience at the premier devision (where he was ranked last) isn't the solution in my  opinion|`|gpNIG15eaa	It spells downfall for Atletico,unless the new coach can do better than what Aguirre did for Atletico.|`|mK06dus9aa	Abel Resino to replace him? I don't know him, is he any good?|`|ai2R3iAzaa	are u out of your mind ??  aguirre is atletico madrid's only hope.|`|7Xridrxaaa	check out my last question! Its regarding that and i agree with med anime|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Whoa he cannot have done much good. So much for all the expectations...
a7yHDybbaa	1. Jimmie Johnson (really, who's going to beat him? None of the other teams have gotten it done over the last 3 years, I see no one beating that team anytime soon.)    2. Greg Biffle (I just have one of those feelings that he's going to have a strong, very strong year. He did very well heading into the chase last year, I think he'll get that momentum going again.)    3. Denny Hamlin (Again, just a feeling he's going to perform strong in 2009.)    4. Jeff Gordon (I think he'll get back to victory lane a couple times, and I believe he will be a strong top 5 and top 10 driver most of the season.)    5. Kyle Busch ( I think he'll win a few times and run several top tens. I just don't think he will be consistently taking all the wins in 2009.)|`|vj6YpJn8aa	Any of the Hendricks driver have a real good shot.  * Jimmy Johnson  * Jeff Gordon  * Dale Jr.   * Mark Martin|`|icTRTBAraa	Now see everyone is picking the favorites.  I am going out on a limb and picking some people I don't know if they will but lets at lease give them a chance.  Oh I don't think Smoke will be anywhere near the chase category this year.    Jeff Burton  Michael Waltrip  Bobby Labonte  AJ Almendinger  Brian Vickers  Ken Schrader  Reed Sorenson  Casey Mears  Kurt Busch  Ryan Newman|`|NC2BfEvLaa	Jeff Gordon   Jimmie Johnson  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Tony Stewart  Kyle Busch  Jeff Burton  Clint Bowyer  Kurt Busch  Kevin Harvick  Carl Edwards  Matt Kenseth  Greg Biffle|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Here's MY top 5 contenders in order.  Jimmie Johnson  Carl Edwards  Jeff Gordon  Kyle Busch  Denny Hamlin  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|xkWLcv62aa	Before I list mine I have to say That Regan is either going to have a FANTASTIC year or a really bad one.    I'd say:  Carl Edwards (Won the NS and runner up in Sprint. its his time)  Jimmie J (Self explanatory)  Kevin Harvick (Its just occured to me how well he did in the later stages of the season)  Greg Biffle (Fav driver, of course I want him to win)  Tony Stewert (Why not? It is his team basically)|`|mXXjoAnfaa	I hope Jr. can get it together this year.  I am also fans of Hamlin and "cousin Carl."  Anybody but Kyle would be tolerable, though.|`|xRsiYmxPaa	here our mine david ragan the busch borther   logano  and lasty one is hamlin|`|JSryPP8faa	Jimmie Johnson just because.  Kyle Busch need's to step it up in the chase and will.  Carl Edwards if he stay's at one track for an entire weekend.  The Biff cause I just like saying The Biff.  Kurt Busch will be the best Mopar driver.    other threats will be Jeff Burton, Matt Kenseth, and Denny Hamlin because they drive for top notch teams.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Kyle...I don't think last year was a fluke. So he will be a contender this year.  My favorite to win.  :0)    Jimmie...OK so he can't be overlooked though I hope someone else wins this year (see above)    Carl .......ARRRRGH...but yes its true he will be a threat    Tony....Watch and see this guy race like the wind in the second half    Elliot............Yep I think he has what it takes and he has something to prove|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Carl Edwards......came up just short last year he and the Cat will be                            doing all they can to get to the top.    Jimmie Johnson....let's face it as long as he had Chad Knaus in his                             corner he'll always be a threat.    Kyle Busch..........As long as he keeps plenty of Coca-Cola in the                             car and doesn't choke on the M&M'S he pops                              during the race then he should be a real threat.|`|tlLEADiiaa	I think everybody needs to watch that RCR crew this year|`|n55igpCUaa	My lead picks are Carl Edwards, David Ragan, and Jeff Gordon.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I am going to say everyone who finished in the top 15 last year and adding Mark Martin..............|`|AA11234673	Junior But of  Course!  Kyle Busch :(  Jeff Gordon  Jimmie Johnson  Carl Edwards  Greg Biffel  Matt Kenseth  Denny Hamlin  Mark Martin  Smoke (I hope)|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Look man,    I work for HMS and the only guys we are worried about is the 18 group. They are really good and had bad luck in the chase last year. Carl (the ******) will let his roid rage get in the way of a title.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	I completely agree with all your picks so I have nothing to add cept maybe I would have put Kenseth first, I always do...lol
7rpILeYtaa	Orton now, ever since he said he has I.E.D (part of storyline but is a factual disorder)    it used to be Kane, but now it would be Orton        if Orton, Kane, Umaga and Mike Knox were in a fatal four way inferno match, i would have to say Kane would still win.  Kane has been in all 4 inferno matches. yes, there has only been 4 inferno matches:  Kane vs Undertaker at Unforgiven 1998  Kane vs Undertaker at Raw is War 1999  Kane vs Triple H on Smackdown 1999  Kane vs MVP at Armageddon 2006    Kane has only lost to the Undertaker in the Inferno matches, so has a win/lose record of 50%.  Orton, Umaga and Knox have not ever been in an Inferno match before.    Kane would have the best advantage as being in 100% of all Inferno matches ever in the history of WWF/WWE.      EDIT: ok, no more heroes 2001. yes, sorry you are correct. Triple H did beat Kane, caused by a distraction from Undertaker. after Taker dropped a bloodied X-Pac on the stage.  again, i admit it. i was wrong about that.    so Kane has only won 1 inferno match, it is still his specialty match, he has been in all 4.  and just because he has only won one, doesn't necessarily mean that he will lose. he has a better chance of winning since he has been in all 4.    it is just like the Undertaker, who has two specialty matches:  Buried Alive and Casket Match.    having a 2/2 win/lose record in the Buried Alive match    and was in 16 of the 19 Casket Matches. winning all but 4. and he is still considered the Favorite at those matches.    and why??  because he has been in more of them then anybody else, who cares if he hasnt won them all, the fact that he has been in the most means that he IS the favorite at winning|`|QQyWUDI8aa	Kane is not heel       Who plays the angry heel the best is Mike Knox    Who plays the angry heel the best,Kane,Orton,Umaga or Mike Knox?  And if you put Kane,Orton,Umaga and Mike Knox in a Fatal Four Way Inferno Match,who will win?    Would be kane because he has been in a Inferno Match|`|6nY99hPmaa	orton no doubt.|`|uiRkBwa9aa	kane by far!!!!!|`|RJMrJN3waa	1) Mike Knox    2) Kane|`|eYs8DpbBaa	Kane or Orton    As of current pushes I would go with Orton, but think Kane should.|`|f9BRmMNVaa	In my opinion, Orton plays the best angry heel.  Kane is 2nd in my opinion.  In a Fatal Four Way Inferno, i dont really get it.  Since its 4 guys, goes 3 guys have to fall into the fire in order for 1 winner to come out?    Ill say Kane wins.  Orton will go for the RKO, but Kane shoves an in-flight Orton into the flames.|`|Uh06bF1daa	kane is always pissed off, probably kane would win considering he has the most experienced in flames|`|lXp33SwSaa	Oh Orton no doubt...    Not only is he a good heel but he personifies the character. And his looks are perfect to play the angry heel he plays now! Have you seen his eyes? It's always covered by shadows! It's awesome!|`|rs7fuvPxaa	orton is my second favourite heel (jericho is first)  and kane would win inferno match|`|YdCPmxivaa	First of all, Inferno Matches are SH*T.  I know, sounds cool on paper, but there has never been an Inferno match that has been any good. Edit: And to correct Powerhouse Of Pain???, Kane lost his Inferno Match to HHH in '99.  So, even though it's his specialty match, Kane has only won it once.    Kane has always been to...what's the word the I'm looking for...seething?  No that's not it.  But it's like a kettle on slow boil, you know?  It's going to burn you, but you don't really take it that seriously.    Orton has never had that just frustration and irritation, at least in his promos which is half the key to nailing down an angry heel.    Image is a loose cannon, but probably too lose.  I don't know, I've never seen him throw a fit after a match so he might fit the bill.  I really should watch more WWE if I want to answer this question accurately.    Mike Knox has managed to have that rage that really you need to classify someone as an angry heel.  Again, I don't have a good grasp on what he's done since I stopped watching WWE in '07.    If I had to pick from the three, I'd pick Kane, but he doesn't always seem to deliver quite right every time.    Now, if you want to see a man who is an expert at being pissed of at the world, look at Mick Foley.  No matter if it was as a face or as a heel, no one can sound more like he's ready to snap then Mick Foley and he is able to transition this anger flawlessly into his ring mannerisms.|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	Orton And Kane......    Orton would win|`|ELcEOOWTaa	I think Jericho actually plays it better than all of them.|`|a0RgVoScaa	The OLD Kane would win. No doubt about it.|`|C2pA5cOCaa	mike does he just his the look that the other don't have! long hair and beard he just looks means!|`|ONuy5vniaa	Orton by far.     The other guys on that list arnt "angry heels", they are just big, mean dudes.    Orton would win that inferno match because he is the one currently being pushed.|`|bSsBGrZVaa	RANDY ORTON
4NOLMLnNaa	should i remind you that attack is the best defense? :)|`|MjPd9vyYaa	What he said ^^^  Real Madrid going to kick your @sses....sorry Speedy I had to say it =p    But I highly doubt that Barca will lose to Sporting Gijon I mean they might score against Barca but we'll probably win. Pep knows what he's doing :)|`|3yqCKPzVaa	LOL I agree with MJ =]    there's no way we're losing at the Camp Nou to Gijon!!!|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	So back line would be Sylvinho, Abidal (probably CD), Caceres, V.Sanchez... LOOOOOL..... I agree 2nd loss is coming either we like it or not... although Sporting Gijon has really really bad defence, so maybe we will score 6or 7 again and I doubt they can score more than 3 goals against us!!!!!|`|TxVAXBpTaa	Yeah.. Barca should be prepare cause Real Madrid is coming at them...|`|JiKNOtvdaa	well we're playing in home so we are usually more powerful playing in the Camp Nou|`|b444ba65c5738d0b8451569d813f6d26aa	Luckily, we're not facing a tough opponent like Sevilla or Valencia next week. We could play with a 3 5 2 formation and as long as we keep the ball in Gijon's half we're good.     I think Pep is gonna put Abidal in CB, which worries me because of what Abidal did last time he played in CB for France against Italy (the penalty). Pep could also find some youngsters from Barca B to play with caceres.     Visca el BARCA!|`|tdsWUGQkaa	that won't be the only loss ;-)
BBsR8hwLaa	It depends on how much you're willing to try. Some people just flop around on their kicks and punches and magically expect to lose weight, (Here's looking at 90 percent of women looking for a quick fix.) However, if you invest killing power into every single move you do, you will be guaranteed to lose twenty pounds in a literal week. Take it from me-I went from being overweight to svelte in a mere month when I put my mind to it.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Yes, if you eat healthy. How long and intense are the sessions? Bottom line there is no quick fix for loosing weight. I've heard of people getting good results with Tae Bo. Good luck!|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Losing bodyfat mostly comes down to clean nutrition, but high intensity exercise can help with that.|`|444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	it will help if you keep a healthy lifestyle  eat well sleep regularly etc...  martial art is a great way to work out but work out alone just does not do it...|`|89178de53c80f9417af7166023891385aa	only if you eat large portions of steak, beans, mash potatoes and eggs while training.|`|AA11587827	sure anytime u move around will help u lose weight, also if u cut back on drinking sodas, anything with sugar in it u will lose weight also|`|bB5d5YVeaa	I was in great shape when I was doing Tae Kwon Do.  You'll burn fat and build muscle (which will reduce your dress sizes).  Go for it!
j6NImFHgaa	I'm not sure if there is a warning before it starts but my husband and I watch it. He probably knows but I never see it from the beginning. But there should be a warning because of the things they say and do on there. Kids should not watch it but I always see alot of kids in the audiences everytime it comes on, but maybe their parents dont care or maybe they have no parents. But yes there should defintely be a warning for the content.|`|ONuy5vniaa	in canada we get one that warns of "programming of a violent nature including mature themes and adult humour."|`|8JkHp562aa	In Austraila It Goes:  This Is Show Features   Stylised Violence Then It Goes With A Wrestler Going WWE Superstars A Professioal Trained Wrestlers Do Not Try To Copy What We Do In The Ring At Home Or At School Then During The Show When It Goes To A Comerical It Comes Up With it Again.|`|7rpILeYtaa	we get a very similar message here in Australia.    just before the show starts, it says something like:    "The following program is classified M,  and is not recommended for children under the age of 15  and for those of you with too much energy,  please do not try this at home"|`|QQyWUDI8aa	In New Zealand, before the show starts the warning is:'The action seen in this program are performed by trained professionals and should be attempted without professional supervision"     i live i New Zealand NZ rocks|`|rs7fuvPxaa	yeah they all do and its M which typically means 15+|`|uiRkBwa9aa	it says Please Dont Try This in Australia.

nb4VGxH7aa	Who knows what Brian Sabean, Larry Baer, and Bill Neukom are going to do? Manny does not care about playing on a rebuilding team or a contender because with his ego, he probably thinks he can make a rebuilding team into a contender. And to say the Giants do not have the payroll to afford him is B.S. They would admit it instantly when asked about the economical status considering a deal with Manny Ramirez by saying no, we have no interest. Instead, like Larry Baer said on the MLB Network, if the Giants feel they have the need to sign Manny Ramirez they will. Benji Molina would have nearly the same statistics batting in front of Manny Ramirez as David Ortiz I believe. Last season he only saw one or two good pitched per at bat. With Ramirez batting behind him, it would be like Jeff Kent in 2002 all over again. Is it likely the Giants sign Ramirez, I don't know. But then again, when the Giants signed Zito it came as a complete surprise to me. That front office is a lot like the Bush Administration. We don't really know what goes on.|`|hrR3cz0Yaa	The Dodgers will still get Manny.  The Giants said they can't afford Manny.  I don't think the Mets have the money. They have a new Stadium.   I don't think the Nats want a player that will be there for 1-3 years.    Even without Manny the dodgers can still take the Division.|`|7uffHRdkaa	Not much of a shock. I'm assuming if it were that late on the West Coast, that reporter would have waited till morning to write that lol The Nats probably won't sign him, nor may Manny be interested if it's not at least 3 years from them. They've got too many OF's. It's coming down to the Dodgers, Giants and whether anyone wants to admit it or not, the Mets. There's rumors circulating that the Mets will slowly work their way into talks with Boras, but this may have to work along with a trade that'd move Delgado, mostly for financial reasons. As far as the Dodgers are concerned though, if Manny's not willing to take this offer or their previous offer if they were willing to put it back up there, they may as well give up with him. Nothing is going to make this guy happy. The last thing you want is this guy playing unhappy for you too. I think the Giants will get more involved, but may not be willing to go 3 years. You never know, considering how stupid they were to bid against themselves for Barry Zito, but with the way how the market is, I wouldn't count on the Giants singing Manny to more than 2 years.    Manny's going to end up a Met towards late February/early March, and when it happens you can go back and look at this early February middle of the night post and say I told you so lol|`|2qrX7l28aa	I think the Dodgers pissed of manny now & he will accept a 2yr package from any other team.|`|Av5ihMezaa	Who knows, Manny is a good player but he is as stubborn as a mule. He probably won't sign anywhere that dose not give him exactly what he wanted when the offseason began. Manny either doesn't understand or doesn't care why most teams can't afford what he is asking. He said a while back if he doesn't get what he wants he would sit out a year or retire, he is that stubborn and may just end up doing that.|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	i just heard on KNBR that the Giants are about to offer him 71 mill for three years    hope he comes to the Bay Area|`|GIVarsPnaa	Great oppurtunity for the Giants to get him now before its too late.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Why sign a one year deal and be a year older and in the same situation again next year?     I don't think Manny wants to play in the NL at all. I really think he's looking for an AL team to sign him so that he could play left-field and DH to extend his career.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	I like your read on the situation Tom, I don't agree entirely, but really I like your thinking.    The statement by the Dodgers is clear now. They would like to have Manny for 1 or 2 years because they feel they have a chance to win right now. Since Manny refused the 2 years 45M earlier, they now show their hand....no long term deal, but come and play with us if you want. They might re-offer the 2 years but that's it.    That throws the ball to the Giants. They wont go 3 years, maybe they hoped to get Manny on the rebound when the Dodgers rebuffed him on the multi year deal..and when Manny turned down the 2 year deal, but it never actually happened...it won't happen now.    Now the Mets. I don't know about the Wilpons...remember Manny behaved badly in Boston. All these owners are friends...will the Wilpons overlook the downside and offer...60-70M over 3 years? I would not do that, but they might.    Minaya, who loves a strong Latino mix, will try to get Manny because he knows Mets are just about set for a championship this year.    My gut feeling. Mets can win without Manny.    I think Manny to the Dodgers for 2 years....Manny the loser, had he shut up and played properly in Boston, he  would be much better off now.|`|bNlYFkB3aa	Dodgers/Mets are the only teams worth signing to at this point in his career, he definitely doesnt want to help any team rebuild in the twilight of his career. Especially now that his offers/year are matching his value.|`|5FAW64vGaa	This is  where the Ginats come in, and say HAHAHA,,,he is ours!!!|`|4TgxrCX4aa	If the Giants aren't offering Manny a deal now, I doubt they ever will.  The Giants are trying to develop a team from the ground up and have a lot of young players, they should be very good in a couple years especially with the pitching they've got.  Besides, they don't want to sign another player to big long-term contract and have it collapse on them again (I doubt Manny would collapse, but you never know).    I think Manny would be a good thing for DC though as he would bring in fans to an otherwise empty stadium and might bring that team up from the bottom of the league.  I don't know whether Manny would want to play in DC though.
3teWTOPqaa	hater hold Kobe to impossible standards.    When Lakers win and Kobe scores high: he is a ballhog    When Lakers lose and Kobe scores high: He is a ballhog    When Lakers win and Kobe scores low: he isn't the leader of the team, he is riding on someone else.    When Lakers lose and Kobe scores low: Kobe choked, can't lead the team.      I mean do you see a winning combination for Kobe? They hold Kobe to such a high standard, sometimes I wonder if they just respect him too much.|`|reIMLCKkaa	he shot over 60% if i am not mistaken, 19 for 31 if they are falling shoot them if he was 19 for 50 and they lost then they may have a case but he was on fire|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Haters always find something to complain about.  If Kobe has 15 points and 10 assists, he doesn't score enough in the haters' minds.  Let them be haters.  They come off as idiots anyway.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	He is!  What has Kobe achieved on his own, he will forever be remembered as the robbin to Batman Shaq.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	As a Knicks fan I watched the game this evening.

It's cool though, the fact that they hate on him so much shows that he truly is great. remember the great will always be hated upon by the envious ones ;)    Oh and i thought i'd just bring this up randomly:  With bynum being out, Kobe will have to pick up his game, I'm predicting that by the end of the season Kobe will be averaging 31 ppg, 6 rpg, and 5 apg. IF the Lakers can secure the  1 spot in the West and have a better record than the Cavaliers and Magic atleast i think it is very possible for Kobe to be the favorite to win MVP =]|`|BntHQeWMaa	any fan and any team would take kobe and his 61 or 81 etc. and his intensity he brings every game.... let them keep talkin sht...|`|OtvtJKwvaa	yes he's on fire, that's why his teammates doesn't score that much, they just went up and down the court and watch him score. the 4 other players look like puppets.|`|ewW1CY3Waa	Kobe plays great against horrible Teams!|`|NSe5Wuduaa	In my opinion Kobe at the moment would not be called a ball hog;no matter how good Kobe is individually He can't win a championship by himself. He might score 61 but its useless if you do and none of your teammates learn and improve from it|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	the problem is he is not giving anyone else on the team to get numbers. 80 percent of the shots taken were by kobe. there is no i in team. what happens if kobe gets injured, where would the lakers be then.  as a player, you have to share the wealth, but kobe does not do that.
dak2csghaa	The concept of a 12 minute mini rock,rap or country show really does not do allot for me. And yes I do like music.    I would rather see a halftime show of 12 to 15 minutes of a high volume  of fireworks.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I dont know, I thought Springsteen was a great choice. His music is popular among every age group and has a great tune. I did not like Tom Petty last year, but I think Springsteen was great. I wouldnt mind seeing a modern band though, like the Goo Goo Dolls or Foo Fighters, given the chance to perform.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Guess what, more people watch the super bowl then 16 year olds.  No 35 year old man wants to see some flavor of the month rapper.   That is why the superbowl acts are "safe" and attempt to bridge over a couple generations.   People like Bruce Springsteen, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Prince.....theyve been making records for decades.       The people that put together the super bowl, know what they are doing, and they arent going to alienate 50 million, to please 10 million.|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	I want some rappers to perform I'm tired of rock|`|15wwA3jjaa	I agree with you, I personally hate most rap, but at this point would welcome it compared to the crap we've been getting ever since Janet and JT ruined it for us.  I would like to see Kanye West get a halftime show, if "Stronger" doesn't get you goin, I don't know what will.|`|A2tuIzH2aa	AC/DC would be wayyyyyy cool|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Agree, Agree, and Agree again. But, I am a cracker so I would like to see some Metallica.    However, blending both cultures with two acts would be best. If you hire Metallica it looks too white and unfair, so a black act has to play as well.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Michael Jackson    Mostly for the irony, though I do like his music.    (edit:) BTW, I know he already did it. I was too young to really enjoy it though, and that game was so lousy, I wasn't really in the mood.|`|TM2yK8nQaa	I thought this year's halftime show was the most boring I ever saw. Geriatric rock stars should enjoy what they were, and not keep trying to recapture their youth.  Bruce, Mick, et al....it's OVER!  Move on.  And for God's sake, can we get someone to sing the national anthem so it doesn't sound like a cat being tortured?  I like both Faith and Jennifer, but honestly, they destroyed both of the songs they sang.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	You are correct, though I like rock music. I cannot believe all the shots at Springsteen(and I am not a big fan).   Who would I like to see?  The Florida A & M Marching band. For a NY Giants home game they during the season they have a college band or a singer(one song). The Super Bowl game is a spectacle, a show.  Watch the NBA All-Star game in a week or so, you will see the same type of show. I really do not need the half time entertainment, but I do not mind aging rock stars.   Have a nice day!|`|MPDgKgIxaa	They should have 50 cent at half time.    http://americanfootballpositions.blogspo...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|XctMTPisaa	Definitely hate the geezer rock show.  I would like to see a medley of performers.  Even crossing genre's for the show like when Mtv had it.  I wouldn't even mind some of those disney acts.  It will expose this world wide audience to artists that they may have never heard of .|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	The whole Super Bowl is a gigantic spectacle, and what better band to be a part of the spectacle than KISS in makeup.|`|MaizmvvMaa	I loved the halftime show, though I am a fan of springsteen. The problem is most kids and teenagers want rap or whatever all that other crazy stuff is, I hate most of it and im only 20, they should keep going the way they are.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	I personally like the older performers that the NFL gets for halftime.  The Rolling Stones was awesome, along with Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen.  I know a lot of younger people would prefer some form of rappers or pop music artists to perform but I think the main audience of the Super Bowl is middle aged.  If I had to choose someone to perform I would love to see The Who or Neil Young.|`|RX8J1mpAaa	Chris Brown and Rihanna!!!|`|l2A2kCIPaa	i totally agree wit u the halftime shows these days do suck  i turn the channel|`|mMLDctjlaa	You can thank the "RIGHT WING" for all the AMAZING  superbowl halftime shows! its gotta be safe meaning the person proforming has to be at least in their 70's|`|9sQ8OQqnaa	I thought that halftime show rocked. How could you not get fired up watching that?|`|kuifoznbaa	I would want him to perform|`|I71WIC0paa	I think your all forgetting that the Super Bowl isn't about the halftime show. It's about enjoying a great game of football, America's most popular sport, with the people around you and having a good time. If you watch it to see a concert at halftime, or the commercials, then you are missing out on what the super bowl and football are all about. I've been quite happy with the NFL's choices in recent years, And thank whoever stopped MTV from ever doing it again, they really have no idea what music is anymore.

Women lack testosterone, so you can weight train 5 days a week and you wont get beefy. 99.9 percent of those freakishly huge female bodybuilders are on steroids.

Not because I want him to win, but because if the WWE wants to run this feud through Wrestlemania, they are going to need to have Bradshaw with the upper hand going into WM25.

Even if a match involving NZ was fixed so NZ was supposed to win they'd find a way to lose. It's just what happens when you come from the land full of notorious losers.     No Australian player has ever been involved in a match fixing scandal. You'll need to ask the Indian's about match fixing. They're professionals at it.|`|a7OKLGQjaa	Yes it is true.

UBIlwiALaa	When Marion was on the Suns he was a fantasy stud, but since his move to Miami he's a just top 50-75 player, so I'd probably say Okur and West right now this year, esp. since Anthony is injured now.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Anthony, despite his injuries he has put up better numbers across the board this season. Are you watching the games, Marion has been abysmal this season. He is a passenger on the team this season, doing absolutely nothing.  I have always been partial to West. For a few seasons he was the best fantasy secret. Both are pretty good in a number of categories. Okur can hit the 3, West is a little better scorer. I feel West is more consistant. One man's opinion.  West & Okur.  Anthony is better than all of the above.  Good luck!|`|f9BRmMNVaa	West and Okur for sure.  Okur have been pretty hot of late too and hes producing a pretty round fantasy statline.

AA10182508	When I was just starting boxing, I find it real easy to beat someone with no footwork and the ones that use wide looping punches.    So, based on this, beginners must first master the art of footwork. How to dash in and out effectively; how to sidestep; how to circle left and right. If you have poor leg coordination you are often put in an awkward and disadvantageous position. Newbies fall into this trap all the time. So, they think they can punch hard!? Well, they have never hit a moving target yet!    Also, you need to strictly discipline yourself to throw straight punches in very good form. Well, sure, wide looping punches are indeed relatively powerful but they're easy to evade, they're slow, they open you up, they put you off-balance when you miss. I tell you, you can beat an opponent that throws looping punches with just a jab for the whole fight.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Buy yourself a skipping rope and introduce running into your routine.

Second Lebron James doesn't have +50 games because he PASSES to get his teamates involved and win in an team effort. (Deomonstrated by his triple-doubles)    Kobe on the other hand, doesn't trust his teamates and does everything by himself. His latest +50 game, he got 0 rebounds on +30 minutes of playing. Compare that to Lebron's Triple-Doubles.    Kobe is a ballhog, but a great ballhog.|`|3teWTOPqaa	In case you didn't notice the common factor in all those high-scoring games: Lakers win.

I bet if he had 15 ast and 20 point yo would be complaining he cant win without Bynum and should have lead the team and scored more    Also Gasol had 31 point aswell    LO, Farmar, Vlad, Sasha and Powell went a combined 4 for 23 so no one else had shots falling.

ZAh8CEoGaa	I don't think there is. You can watch the recap only in NBA.com. Sometimes youtube members plays the whole game in 10 minute clips. You just need to try and find it. Good luck.|`|WUuO6wbAaa	Yes, there is. Go to Adthe.net. Most games usually work on there. It's really a great site. Not just can you watch Laker games on there, but you can watch virtually all NBA games on there, as well as plenty of Hockey games too. Personally, I'm not interested in hockey, but I love watching the basketball games. If that site doesn't work, and from time to time it may not, Justin.TV usually has loads of people in their search engines who'll provide the games on their own links. Usually they make their money through ads, so watching the game helps their business. As far as ATDHE.net though, I'm guessing advertisements is how they get paid, but how ever they do it, I love it. I got the tip from someone on here too, but the question got deleted. I may have by acctident or Yahoo did, I forget.|`|BKKKMviiaa	Try www.nba.com. It has great quality videos of previous mathchups. But definitely it will be only some previews and highlights of the game. If you want the whole mtach, try searching it at youtube after sometime.|`|ewW1CY3Waa	yes there is.

TPOZKPV4aa	Nobody can tell you what gun is good for you, if your a beginner in Airsoft you should try all the models, keep in mind Airsoft weapons have different specs (you may not think so, but they do) such as Barrels Length, Weight, Retractable stock or full stock, max capacity of battery usage.    AEG or "Airsoft Electric Gun" are really good and doesn't really require a lot of fuss to deal with, just set it to the right charge and you prob get more then 250 FPS.    Spring are also good but not the strongest, you could get 250 FPS but they are extremely weak at firing (from my experience)     Likewise the common model for anybody might into Airsoft is usually the Mp5, its got a lot of modifications you can put into.    Either that or is the M4 Series / AK47 Series    The only way to get a $70 dollars Airsoft gun, is mostly spring, if your looking for example Tokyo Mariu or Classic Army, your guarantee to go about 100ish. Unless you can buy them 2nd hand from Chinese Made, which is hard to get in the US and the only two places is either online or Hong Kong, Kwong Wah Street.     Heres a table for you.

The quality stuff tends to come from Japan and more and more often the Taiwanese and Hong Kong stuff is good (I've owned and liked Marui, ICS, and Classic Army as have many of my family and friends).  When it comes time to get an AEG, you should get one that uses a version 3 gearbox, these include the AK's and the G36 style guns among a few others.  I find version 3 gearboxes much easier to work on and much less prone to break, whereas version 2 is more likely to have problems (version 2 is usually found in M16/AR15 variants and MP5s among others).    Best guns I've ever used were the Marui P90, Marui AK47 and AK47 Spetz, and the Marui G36K, they are all phenomenal!  Followed closely by an ICS MP5 which I didn't expect to hold up like it does so I upgraded it with better internals to become a fantastic Airsoft Gun.|`|jEJxcWq5aa	Unfortunately, anything your looking at, is going to be an LPEG, or low-quality spring.

DOVbF4Piaa	Go to a place that will let you try them out.  You shouldn't have any problem, most of them accommodate a wide range of sizes.
PXkvDyYwaa	That is about one size too big for you. You should ride an 18 or 19 inch frame depending on your torso length and how you ride.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	No, that bike is not a 21 inch frame and is too big for you.  The XL is a 22.4 inch frame according to the "E" measurement.  With a 32 inch inseam you want a 17-18 inch frame.  Frames are measured from the center of the crank to the top of the seat tube.  The stand over height is 32.2 which means you cant stand over the frame.  You want 2-4 inch stand over clearance on a mountain bike.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	You do not need that size. I am 5/10 and I ride a 18.5in Genesis. I am a 32 inseam too.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	At 5-8 w/ a 32" inseam a 18" (med) frame would work the best. A XL frame is way to big and you will normally find 6'-2"+ riders on them.|`|RQzsmvfiaa	Actually, you're fall between an M and L size frame. Try both before buying. The XL is too big for you
AA11542500	When you hold your breath, the body builds up more dissolved Carbon Dioxide in the blood.  It decreases the pH of the blood that if it gets to low could cause acidosis but your reflex to breathe will hit you before your body reaches that state.  Low oxygen to the brain could cause you to "black out" as well but we're talking holding your breath for several minutes here.  There's also a big difference if you're just sitting there holding your breath versus swimming.|`|nKwcGLQraa	nope|`|pXhoYvzkaa	no. it expands your lungs and helps you hold your breath even longer.|`|L5IsUhacaa	To a degree, no. As long as you are training your lungs to be able withstand the absence of flowing oxygen for a set time. But if you hold your breath for too long, you will naturally pass out, letting your body take over and let you breath at a normal rate again.|`|yS5f1XLFaa	no, when you hold your breath for a long time underwater, you are training ur brain and ur lungs. after a while, ur lungs will expand and u can hold ur breath for even longer underwater. however if ur vision starts to go black or fuzzy thats a bad thing so come up for air.|`|PDJ8cy68aa	No way. It helps to expand you lung capacity. Learning to hold your breath for a long time is a good skill.|`|0cCV9Litaa	Nope, it actually helps by expanding the lungs.|`|LgC2oA77aa	yes, your brain requires a lot of oxygen and low percentage of that in your blood shall kill many brain cells|`|MCJAYZeZaa	No it actually helps to improve your lung capacity, which is beneficial for cardiovascular exercise.|`|WpUxjPWxaa	In some ways, yes, in some ways, not. If you hold your breath for toooooooooooo long, it will damage your brain cells which is not a good thing. But holding your breath in swimming, it actually makes your lung stronger and it expands.

gHIgypdEaa	I had no idea Steve Kerr was such a sniveling little weasel.|`|586A1x7Uaa	I think being a fan of Spurs or Phoenix could cloud your judgment.  And I don't think any person is immune.  However, the major problem that Steve Kerr's commentary wanted to address, was to keep the playoff legitimate.  After the phoenix loss to San Antonio the viewer ship dropped significantly, because viewers started seeing the playoffs as arbitrary.  I think people like to watch a fair game.  I didn't even watch the next two games of  the series.  If you read all the commentaries right after the incident, they were all trying to keep people interested in watching the rest of the playoffs.    The series already was suffering from legitimacy because Steve Nash missed the end of game 1.  Once the suspensions occurred, it lost the rest of it.|`|Trxn2gy8aa	And where's the proof that the NBA had an investigation into that? Because I don't believe you.     And yet another fake, bandwagon jumping female Spurs "fan" tries to say Nash was acting when Horry gave him an unexpected forearm and pushed into Nash while he was trying to stay in bounds. They like to make excuses for Cheap Shot Rob. As if you could possible get ejected immediately, and then suspended for 2 playoff games over someone flopping. I don't know whether Spurs fans are more delusional than they are clueless. It's one of them though.|`|VCfvwqDtaa	I'm a huge Spurs fan and i say let's give the issue a rest. what's done is done.    The spurs will win their 4th title tomorrow, period.    Go Spurs go!!|`|hWbYOH3aaa	First and foremost, Kerr left Yahoo immediately after his TNT analyst contract was up.  Yahoo and Steve parted ways mutually, and this was how it was always going to work long before the NBA Playoffs even occurred.  He wasn't going to stick around for the finals, because as a GM, the more time you have to work before the next season, the better.      Second of all, the incident in question, where Bowen and Duncan did in fact leave the bench was mentioned MANY different times by MANY different sources, and was analyzed  several times on ESPN.  The NBA deemed that the incident didn't apply under the same rule as the Diaw/Stoudamire incident.  Steve did not vehemently argue this.  He never even mentioned it again after his initial mention in the first article about that game.  He didn't do that because he was looking out for the best interest of Phoenix, but because he was being paid to analyze what happened during the playoffs, and that game was a big deal.  Kerr's done nothing unethical, he's only done his job.  There's nothing even remotely dubious about this.|`|MDduCKpZaa	im a suns fan, and i think that you should give this issue a rest already.    kerr wasnt attempting to suspend them, he was just stating the right thing. but then, you know. stern and stu are dirty too... cant do anything about that|`|9154f5872324f4dc04da9450db7ad101aa	It was ethical because he didn't offered the job as a Suns GM yet at that time.    What wasn't ethical about him was most of his articles were biased especially on the Mavs, Spurs and the Lakers.|`|UB9N0vpKaa	First of all Kerr didnt leave in the middle of T.N.T'S playoff coverage.He left when they were done,in fact delaying his annoucement.Second Kerr played and won a championship with the spurs.If you had a clue as the type of person Kerr is you would read that article you so threw in everyones face and see the first point Kerr made was Stoudimare and Daiw should be suspended as to the letter of the law.But at the end he suggested the only person worthy of suspension was Horry are you going to disagee with that?|`|5e96e6b6f7e5da9983a0c8703a80dff2aa	Thats Ridiculous! Why would they both get suspended? Thats almost the stupidest thing i've ever heard. The first was when Tim Duncan was Ejected from the game for laughing. Diaw and Stoudemire were clearly going on the court to contribute to the fight. The spurs are one of the best sportsmanship team. Nash a a good actor. Horry did shove him, but not as hard as he made it seem. And Horry did pay his due. he was suspended for two games! Drop it already!

I rooted for them over san antonio, since they are as boring as it gets....|`|4vS5dTL1aa	Nobody because they both suck!!!!!!!|`|cQHlhnH0aa	me being truthful, i think lebron is the reason the cavs have all the sucess that they have, if you took him off that team , they don't really have anybody that could take over the team, and lead them like he has
zDkuXkFGaa	As of right now I will go with the Cubs. They have done good of late and are better than the Sox. But as Cub fan, ya can never get your hopes up, anything can happen. But I agree with ya just because they won the Series in 2005 it doesn't mean a dang thing! They sure as heck didn't make the playoffs at all last year, and this year they started off worse than they did last year.|`|hbk3u47Jaa	stick to knitting sweatheart.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	GO CUBBIES  !!! and i am glad the whinney sux are falling apart|`|39428afbdb9cf9486da22c9595fe11c2aa	North side will always dominate the south side! Go Cubbies!!|`|kiAouJeyaa	Well i like both because i'm from chicago and want to see every chicago sports team do well, but as far as this year i think the cubs are the better team and they might not win the whole thing but i think they will make the playoffs and if they stay healthy maybe to the NLCS because once their pitching really starts to click at the same time as their offense they will be a very hard team to beat.
828c070bb9fd633a6a1d1b2f87dae9eeaa	First, you need to know that NOS is not to be used in any paintball application.    Your choices are CO2, HPA (High Pressure Air), or Nitrogen (now obsolete).    You "can" use HPA in a CO2 tank, provided you don't fill it past 800 psi. A feat that is as equally pointless as it is dangerous if you don't have the right equipment.    Most high-end guns are incompatible with CO2, because a high rate of fire means more CO2 expansion. CO2 is stored as a liquid, and anything going from the state of liquid to gas will get colder. A higher rate of fire provides less time to warm the gun between shots, resulting in freezing and the higher chance that liquid CO2 will escape from the tank into the gun.    It's bad for the delicate seals required for high-end internals, so it's best not to bother with it. The cold can freeze and damage the seals, and it sometimes does so to the electronics if the tubes pass close enough. It can also freeze tight-fitting moving parts together.    To clear up any other questions about gas... HPA can be used in CO2 guns, because the pressure of the entering gas is the same (thanks to built-in regulators on all HPA tanks).    You shouldn't use CO2 in the following guns:    Autocockers (before the Trilogy came out)  Any electropneumatic gun (Angel, Matrix, Ion, Shocker, etc)  Automags (with the exception of the Classic valve)  ATS guns (asking a question like that, it's safe to assume you've never heard of ATS)    Note that any mechanical gun (besides those mentioned above) that has an electronic frame attached can still use CO2. This is because in those guns, the electronics only replace the trigger operation, not the actual firing operation, and thus the CO2 does not affect the electronics.|`|t5EXmcuBaa	You shouldn't. NOX would wreck the internals of the marker. You should only use the gas that the marker is rated for.|`|WLkIQLUUaa	No you cannot use nitrogen in a CO2 tank. You have to have a compressed air tank for that. You can use CO2 in some high end markers, but most use compressed air. I wouldnt reccommend CO2 in a compressed air marker. It will destroy the internals.
dbceefc089897443890e1c5e77cba51baa	you should NEVER have backspin when striking for a hard shot on goal...topspin is great.  the main thing in a hard instep drive is to be able to come directly at the ball (as opposed to a field goal kicker), planting your non-kicking foot next to the ball, fully cocking your hip and knee, and delaying your knee extension thru the ball until your knee is OVER the ball. even go for a slight outside to in strike motion..i.e. roberto carlos!!   but you will not master it by tonight.  watch internet replays of great strikes on goal from outside the box...most will fit the above mechanics.|`|Orx3fhU6aa	To really hammer the ball into the net first make sure you hit the ball with the top of you foot(your laces). Before you kick the ball put your non-kicking foot beside the ball. Next dont lean back when you hit the ball or it will go to high. Try to lean over the ball. Lastly, after you kick the ball follow through with your foot to get the maximum power.|`|dKYT0jM3aa	just hit the ball.....what ever shot u take and its heading towards goal? more than likley it will go in. just shoot shoot shoot with effort.|`|UWV4MBFPaa	the more you lean back the higher the ball goes so keep upright as much as possible head down over it and strike wit the laces

A few mat skills, and a basic understanding of wrestling would probably help, but as John Cena has proven, it's not a requirement.|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	To keep yourself safe and learn how it is done, attend a pro wrestling camp or school.. Costs some dough but you will learn how to entertain inside and outside of the ring and respect the business.
LVCjYU8Uaa	Being a team captain and being a good leader are not intrinsically the same.    Vick is exciting, but he is a poor leader. He doesn't make important plays, he doesn't inspire or elevate his teammates, and he commands little respect outside of his running ability.    People dislike Vick for fairly legitimate reasons. He is extremely over hyped, he has never put together a terribly good season, he is a dreadful passer, and a turnover waiting to happen. On top of all of this, he lacks any sense of class or integrity. Quite frankly I don't understand why anyone outside of his immediate family does like Vick. He is a bad football player, and a worse person. He has no sense of responsibility, and has never proven himself to be anything other than a problem on and off the field. Vick is absolute garbage.      Edit: @Ashleyjr:    He got his team to the NFC championship? You mean 2004? With his stellar 56.4 completion percentage? His "brilliant" 78.1 quarterback rating? His mere 14 touchdowns versus 12 interceptions? The year he fumbled 16 times? I guess his 3 rushing touchdowns ups his scores to 17, but the 7 lost fumbles gives him 19 turnovers. That's actually pretty awful.    I'm sure it had nothing to do with having one of the NFL's top defenses (ranked  5 in fantasy leagues). Or his running backs producing over 1600 yards and 17 touchdowns.     And in those playoffs Vick produced a total of 2 touchdowns, and had only 363 yards combined (rushing and passing) in those two games.    Only 2 of the Falcons 7 touchdowns in the 2004 playoffs can be attributed to Vick, the alleged leader of the team.|`|AA10399154	I agree he isn't a leader, ponder about this, would a team leader ever flick the spectators off, have any involvement in dog fighting whats so ever (His property was being used and he said he had no clue about that, what kind of bull$hit is that?)     Look at all the great leaders Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Warren Moon (For those who think I'm being racists in picking only white QBs), etc. They unselfishly played tha game and LEAD the team with little or no off the field issues.    So, Vick = No Leader, Just another overpaid player|`|AA10450002	no cuz he actually is a team captain dumbass. u must be another vick hater and a dog lover|`|bd7900847dd61e1a1baa532c6adf96dcaa	No. It don't matter if you think he is a good leader. It matters if those other guys think he is and they said yesterday that he was. Just because he is not Peyton Manning or Tom Brady does not mean he is not a leader. And let's not forget he got this team to the NFC championship game a few years ago. And I don't think anybody on this website has any business saying how much class and integrity he has because we don't know him.|`|AA11099903	I agree. I think the Falcons should have put him at running back. He would be a better player there. Matt Schaub would have been a better leader for this team.|`|ysWSlagGaa	vick leads by example  obviously his off the field stuff isnt really helping much  but i dont necessarily think he doesnt have any leadership  he makes amazing plays  so like i said...  he leads by example

55924ff2fad0b520bee69199bd0830bdaa	The grandfather of Vince McMahon, Roderick James McMahon (who is often called "Jesse"), created the CWC (Capitol Wrestling Corporation) in 1953. He was a boxing promoter before. His partner was the wrestler Raymond "Toots" Mondt. This promotion was a part of the NWA (Northern Wrestling Alliance). In these days, there were territories in many countries all over the world (e.g. Japan, Puerto Rico, Mexico, New Zealand) and all over the US (e.g. Georgia, Florida, California etc.). Almost all of them held their events under the umbrella of the NWA, and they had a common champion, the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, who travelled through the territories to defend his title. The other wrestlers mainly stayed in their territories and fought there, and the shows could only be seen in this part of the country.   In the end of 1953, Jesse McMahon stepped back from the promotion, and his son, Vincent James McMahon, took his place. When McMahon and Mondt had a fight with the NWA because of the Championship (they wanted their wrestler "Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers to stay Champ, but NWA made him lose against Lou Thesz), they seperated from them and founded the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). That happened in 1963. In 1979, the WWWF was changed to WWF (World Wrestling Federation), just because it sounded better.  In 1982, Vincent Kennedy McMahon purchased the WWF from his father. He destroyed the territories by showing his promotion all over the US, and by holding events everywhere. So, the territories broke down, and many promotions had to close down. Vince McMahon is still the boss of the WWF, which is called WWE now, due to a lawsuit in 2000 against the World Wildlife Fund.|`|AA11805862	wwwf was created back in the late 50's early 60's. it became wwf in 1970's and then wwe in 2002.|`|y5NNYM5iaa	long ago my friend|`|SPib7Zsoaa	The 80's was when the wwf (now wwe) was created. the wwwf was created back in the 50's (i think. not positive though)|`|tfsapQeKaa	1953, by Roderick J. McMahon (Vince's grandfather).  But back then, it was called the Capitol Wrestling Corporation.|`|aRCMkZEMaa	my msn is currently locked so dont reply to this message|`|vmsneeWyaa	wwf wasn't created just like that. it started as a "vision" of Roderick James "Jess" McMahon in 1920s, as boxing promos in madison square garden. it was then known as capitol wrestling (the CWC). to sum things up, it became the wwf in 1982, i think, when Vince Mc Mahon bought the CWC from his own father. Against his father's wishes, McMahon began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the sport. and wwf evolved thru the years to what it is today. if you want to know the details, go on to wikipedia.com and just search for wwe, you'll find it all
ishPf2Glaa	Noone... Dont make any trades, see what a new coach has to offer to the table, see how the team can react to a new style of play... Just sit back and enjoy... Making trades doest seem smart right now... Kidd joined a team with a completely different dynamic, more than halfway through the season. You cant expect him to just lead the team to a championship without changing the style of play the team has... Its the same with the Suns, sit back, and relax, offseason means new strategy, and a new future...|`|bBie8Atdaa	Jason Terry    Get a solid shooting guard. Iverson to Dallas would be awesome.

I personally would have voted Horford for his consistent play and occasional show of dominance, but Durant's overall numbers were better.|`|tGiMV1pPaa	no, i think al horford or luis scola should've won it simply because they contributed not just by scoring.   and because kevin durant had a very low percentage season shooting wise.|`|69lqgP6Taa	Who cares, MVP is the real award.|`|7dd92fa9e1fedaa65abe9b3824b3fba3aa	No It should have been horford|`|CsBbb7xWaa	I am.

There are already stories out there that D'Antoni is interested in the Bulls job- and we know there was definitely some issues regarding coaching philosophy, etc.    Nothing else has been announced but it seems like it's leaning towards D'Antoni not wanting to come back.

f1FRCSdTaa	there's an article I read once on the Stars website on the meaning behind nhl team names this is what was said about Tampa Bay    Tampa Bay Lightning  While many team names have come about in a variety of odd ways, Tampa Bay may take the cake as far as being the least conventional in their decision. Then-general manager Phil Esposito was sitting on a deck with friends overlooking the bay when a lightning storm hit the area. After two bolts struck nearby, someone mentioned that Lightning would be a good name for a hockey team, especially one located in the lightning capital of the world. The rest, as they say, is history.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Not sure but it's certainly a fitting name as the highest frequency of lightning strikes in the US occurs right around the Tampa area.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	According to a young lady from Central Florida whose company I kept for a period of time, the Central Florida area gets more electrical storms than any place in north America.

wmyew1ERaa	I ski. I've been skiing for almost 60 years and I'm loath to try something new with a new learning curve and bruises.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Well ive always wanted to try both, I am actually goin on my first trip in March, so I have choosen Snowboarding as it suits my personality!|`|6Ej4R0pUaa	I'm a snowboarder!!    I've tried both and it's definitely easier to learn skiing than snowboarding. When you learn to snowboard you definitely spend a lot of time falling over and getting bruised. But for me, snowboarding is definitely a lot more fun and was worth the pain of learning. It's a different feeling to skiing and it lets me feel completely free on the mountain.    And, once you've mastered the basics on snowboarding, you can progress a lot faster than you can with skiing as it's a far less technical sport.     Whilst it's a sweeping generalisation and exceptions of course always occur, snowboarders and skiers tend to be quite culturally different. The snowboarders attitude and lifestyle is more in keeping with my own.|`|rFQXKD64aa	Ski!    I've tried snowboarding but heck, it's a lot easier to learn when you don't have any previous ski habits to break...  Needless to say, I sucked at snowboarding (though it was fun when i wasn't flat on my butt) and have gone back to skiing ever since.|`|B0aUPvI5aa	Both have have their individual pros and cons (i do both)!    it is widely accepted that snowboarding is tougher to pick up. however, i found and i think many other people have too, that once you have the "knack" you can progress at a very quick rate. unfortunately, unless you are willing to put in alot of time and effort into snowboarding, it is likely that your skill level will "plateau" fairly quickly. this is unless you focus on powder (in my opinion snowboarding in powder will beat skiing in powder any day).    one thing that i do hold against snowboarders is that they do "cut up" the slopes more than skiiers! snowboarders have only one point of contact on the snow, therfore more force and more snow displacement.     skiing on the otherhand is easier to pick up but progressing is alot slower so it will take you a longer time get up to a respectable standard!    i still dont actually know which disapline is "cooler". i used to be convinced that snowboardong is cooler, but recently watching the pros go at it, ive started to think that skiing actually looks better cruising down the slopes and in the park! comparing skiiers and snowboarders do various rotations, skiiers appear alot crazier with flailing skiis all over the place making the rotation look that little bit more extreme!!!|`|Xpdpm2Muaa	Ski|`|UNw3L5qfaa	I've been skiing since i was 3.    Last year i tried to learn to snowboard and love it - although its so painful i keep thinking "ahhh i could be having so much fun if i just get my skis. BUT I LOOK SO COOL!"    I'm sure everyone on here thinks about when they're going back to the snow at least twice a month.|`|GOs6Bl7taa	definitly SKIING    love it  love it  love it|`|HvOuJjDyaa	Both!    I skied for 10 years, then switched to boarding for a new challenge.  It's a myth that being able to ski doesnt help you learn to board, though it's true that they are very different. Each has it's own pros and cons, and in an ideal world I'd have the gear for both and switch per day or even per slope!|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Skiing|`|47a351e058b1e2e9d4f9a2bfc0f35883aa	skiing [=|`|kzkrll3Xaa	ski :)|`|EgbIYBehaa	Snowboarding!|`|d0a3973ddc8524cb999a0f2e91646fc4aa	This is my first season doing either skiing or snowboarding. I wanted to do skiing because I've always liked watching World Cup ski racing on TV. I've gotten pretty good at it by my fourth day on skis. If I were snowboarding I would be falling a lot. But I think I would be good at both of them because I have pretty good coordination. If you do snowboarding, make a fist and don't fall on your hands because otherwise you could break your wrist.

Therefore, Liverpool fans are just worried that they'll end up in the UEFA Cup. Which, I think they will. Arsenal play the best football in Britain, second behind Barcelona in Europe (not to insult any Man Utd fans, who are fantastic).    So, basically, Man U will win the league, chelski second, Villa third, Arsenal fourth, and Liverpool 5th, if they can stay that high.    And before I get bashed for being a Man U/Arsenal fan, I support the (very un)mighty Leyton Orient in League 1, so I have a somewhat objective viewpoint.|`|p8lB73rdaa	Thought you were going to be nice from now on : )|`|cOPCNP7Laa	No, it's bc they realize they cannot talk much about the club above them so they try to talk about the one below.

I see another 12-4 maybe 11-5 season for them mostly because it's just what they do. Great defense and good offense. I say good mostly because that O-Line let him down alot this year. If they can improve that, then they could be great.

Looks like a reasonable view but I'd go high on tier 1 or low on tier 2, as it's not so low as to be eye level (missing a lot of the action) and not too high, (to feel removed from some action at the other end of the pitch).

Not like the way Brett lee recd it last year.  That looked good. He played so well.|`|cusngBDQaa	nobody knows what Allan Border is, it did post|`|HgXjAxzKaa	When would you like the AB medal on then?
18oY8vt6aa	"Found wanting", thats all I can say.  Kiwi proud, but when I saw him play I couldn't see what the fuss was about.  He would struggle in our National Competition in NZ let alone have a chance in the S14. However it shows the difference in the NH definition of Class to the SH!!    Carter = Class  Cipriami = Ar@  (well i'm sure you get it).|`|0xfVyxxIaa	He was never up to snuff.    Sorry poms but it was just another publicity stunt from the English RU. Just like Vainakolo...|`|ETarSy9Maa	That is the best decision he's made in EVER.    Flood and Geraghty are soooo much better, they are consistent, reliable and have experience.    Cipriani should never have been playing test rugby.|`|MgVbgbT0aa	i just don't think he is that good! I am a welsh fan and we have the same problem with Hook-one minute he is a world beater and the next he is awful.     Stephen Jones is still Lions first choice!|`|AA11406778	Oh... my.. god... He went to Milan to watch a frickin fashion show with the Beckhams??!!  Was he looking for a new hand bag?I share the embarrassment of a combined United Kingdom.  What a cringe fest.  He has brought the game into disrepute & shouldn't be allowed to play club rugby let alone another test.  There is no place in test rugby for sissies or girlie girls.|`|90b5fbd3f2fee5815fd62d5eb3574d3eaa	I'd say so, when he debuted for Wasps (I'm a Wasps girl!) he was a promising player and loads of people thought 'hey, we're onto something good here!'. Then he met a Cheeky Girl, discovered OK! Magazine, Heat, Closer and the like. Oh and then Kelly Brooke. He has got worse and worse, maybe being dropped by Johnson will be a wake-up call? Let's hope so.     He's a talented rugby player, but celeb-dom isn't for him. It doesn't mix with rugby. After all, how often do you see other good players, such as Sackey and Lewsey appearing in Heat?! all you have to do is look at Gavin Henson, he discovered fame and then where did he go?!|`|fb8cf3b98ef09933fab9b85eed26fcf3aa	can any bloke not have his head turned by kelly brooke!!!!!|`|98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	He should take advice from Gavin Henson..............
AMqmSjqraa	although bracken is a very good odi bowler but he is not quick|`|gz2M5hsBaa	He had his shot, he failed miserably.|`|7dJvSe2Raa	I think most test teams prefer out and out pace in test cricket which is why Bracken is often overlooked for test cricket but I think Bracken has enough variety to warrant a place over the younger less experienced bowlers but most test teams now do not go for slower consistent bowlers.    South Africa also made it clear those were their intentions when they dropped Shaun Pollock in Oct 2007 from the test matches although he was always a regular in odi cricket.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Sir Paddles said it all.

KsFV7CJWaa	If he really wants to break Bobby Moore's record and stay fit, he should stay at Milan. But he has an agreement with LA Galaxy, and if he wants to go to Milan, then he will have to "buy out" his contract. I think he should stay at Milan, a player of his caliber does not need to waste his talent at LA Galaxy.|`|1XEUETPKaa	He would be much better off staying with ACM, but I doubt LA will let him go...You'd be wasting so much skill and talent playing with Galaxy and He's already done so much for ACM.
lNfO7mb8aa	It would happen because of your diet. when your training heavily you should have alot of slow carbs in the morning and quick carbs in the evening these are easy to work out with, and are great for defining muscle. also try eating alot of Protein aswell. always good for definition.    Btw.. rugby is an awesome sport ********.|`|xkqJ6KMvaa	Perhaps try playing a better sport|`|Efns7sDLaa	don't eat healthy food like fruit and try to eat as many carbs as you can, my brother regularly has this problem.

a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	There is a rival league. Sort of. It's called the NCAA.    Honestly, I find college basketball much more entertaining than the NBA. The athletes are down to earth, they play hard every game, and that results in a lot of comebacks and crazy endings.    I'll take March Madness over the NBA playoffs any day.|`|IYF4xSTdaa	no.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Amen.|`|qsv4NmbDaa	I dont watch neater of them, guess where I was during super bowl. I was enjoying the nice empty streets, a nice quiet walk on the beach, and an empty restaurant for dinner. I loved it I wish it was like this everyday nice and quiet. Ohh and that football and basket ball stuff way to over rated. I just watch the last 4 seconds of the game cause that's the only time they play their hardest.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	I'm not ashamed of NBA fans.  People love their favorite players and teams.  But I do agree with you about the star treatment in terms of fouls being called for them.  I think Dwayne Wade is a great guy, but the way the refs called the 2006 finals for him was just a travesty.  Not just because it altered the outcome that year, but because it encouraged teams to play boring basketball.  Basketball ought to be about teamwork and having 5 guys out there setting up offensive and defensive plays  and passing to achieve greatness.  It shouldn't be about running iso plays every time down so your quickest player can then slam into his defender hoping either for a basket or a foul.  Because then everybody tries it and not everyone has a Wade on their team.  And I agree with you... Stern's trying to market the NBA as a league with 4-5 unstoppable heroes who can only lose to another hero in the playoffs, and if you don't have one of those heroes you're the Washington Generals as far as the marketing department's concerned.  I understand historically basketball's been dominated by superstars more then the other sports, but there's no reason to encourage it further by giving fouls to the most popular players.|`|ndopqX6Taa	The NBA is the worst of any professional leagues. It is the one championship I do not watch. The NBA is absolutely boring.|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	What is NBA? I have heard of MBNA, it's credit card company, the other, not in the UK.|`|AA10313901	I am ashamed of any professional athlete who "trash talks" instead of conducting himself/herself like an actual professional.    That sort of "trashy" behavior belongs with wrestle-mania idiots.|`|bUUjQVhKaa	Totally agree dude...|`|OKpoqhUMaa	yahhhhh totalllllly|`|UfWx65PTaa	nba is rigged-just ask mc canughy|`|AA10248312	Both the NBA and the NCAA have gone downhill... March  Madness is still better than the NBA playoffs... but the problem with the NCAA is that anyone who's any good (at that level) goes to the NBA after one year.   When you have the best college players leaving after only one year, it means the NBA is filling up with guys who aren't really all that great at the NBA level, which makes the quality of play in the NBA suffer as well.  There are always a few exceptions... Lebron was ready for the NBA right after high school (but Kevin Garnett, for example, was not,  he would have benefited from a year in college, assuming he could have gotten into college).    It used to be that even the best players in college would play at least 3 years... a couple of guys like Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas were the exceptions, they played two years...  but Patrick Ewing played 4 years at Georgetown, Charles Barkley played 3 years at Auburn, Clyde Drexler played 3 years at Houston (as did Olajuwon), Larry Bird played 3 years at Indiana State (he was also redshirted), Chris Mullin played 4 years at St Johns, John Stockton played 4 years at Gonzaga, Karl Malone played 3 years at Louisiana Tech, and even Michael Jordan played 3 years at Carolina, David Robtinson - 4 years at Navy... these are all-star players and original Dream Team Members...     How different would college basketball have been if Lebron James had gone to college?  If Carmello Anthony had played more than one year?  Geez, even Andrew Bynum would only be a senior this year I think...  He and Greg Oden could have battled it out in college, but with each of them being the best players on the court, rather than supporting players as they are now.  The first college game I ever taped on a VCR was the Georgetown-Houston NCAA finals in 1984 (Ewing vs Olajuwon).  They don't have matchups like that in college any more.    So the rapid movement from high school (until recently banned by the NBA) or from one's freshman year in college to the NBA has hurt both the NBA and college basketball.    Of course, I understand that you can't tell these guys not to take the money and run, but it has hurt the game at both levels.    And yeah, most fans don't know jack, because you can't learn about basketball by simply watching Sportscenter... that's the WORST way to try to learn about the game.

ASNnhmR5aa	I think she could reach the semi final and lost to Dementieva.  If she was fit, she probably wins the second set through a tie-break since Serena was leading.    Kuznetsova, I think Azarenka is strong enough to beat her, but I think she would lost to Dementieva in semis.|`|1w5blbobaa	Well I would definitely say SHE WOULD BE STOPPED IN THE 4th ROUND by SERENA anywayk,the reason are....     SERENA WILLIAMS can come back 4om any situation,she has one of the the best recorord of coming back even if she is down 3 match points.So 1 set break can't decide the fate of the match when SERENA is other side of the match.     With full respect 2 Azarinka the HIT was 4 both the players & if some1 couldn't able 2 continue,that's not her opponents fault.& U have 2 accept LUCK matters a loooot in any sports.     Im sure Azarinka has a gr8 future ahed bt when Williams is in full form She can beat evantually ANYONE in the world & Serena knows when She need 2 bring her game.|`|6W4vcjFhaa	If Azarenka was well she might have given Serena a test but no one knows what could have happen.  Serena has played some of the best players and was at match point and yet find way back to win matches.  Serena is a great player because even when she is playing badly she can find ways to win a match.  She is very strong mentally and that is one of the greatest assets in tennis.  Don't forget that Dementieva should have beaten her and so was Safina.   They both beat Serena leading up to the Aussie open.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Easily would of got to the final if she was fit.  Probably would of won the AO if Safina was the same as she was against Serena.. But i think it would have been a better (by better i mean longer more even final) if she did beat Serena and make it there.|`|2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	When Serena is healthy and in shape, it doesn't matter who you put across the net.  Victoria, Maria, Ana, Venus- they're all about the same.    A fit Serena is like Shaq in his prime-the most dominant force in women's tennis.  Too big and too strong for everyone else.    Best bet is to lure Serena to the buffet tables in Vegas and distract her with a  fashion show, so she'll be unprepared for her match :)
ILVCgXcYaa	What you are referring to is the unseen camera footage in between rounds that showed Kevin Jackson rubbing him down with grease, there were times that BJ used his high guard to work submissions and gsp easy his way out and passed the guard. From what I understand kevin knew this and continued to do it after the commissioner told him not to.

The guy's the best player the game of tennis' ever seen - I know it, Rafa knows it, he himself knows it, we all know it -, so that's gotta be particularly tough on him. It broke my heart seeing him like that, but then it made me admire him even more when he accepted Rafa's hug and words, showing that he doesn't translate any of his frustration into anger or anything negative towards Rafa himself. They're both amazing people who respect and admire each other even though they're each other's biggest rival. That's amazing.|`|ixKOGishaa	You really are a big jerk....aren't you?Comeon !!! count Putin youre such an ***...Go **** a damn  toilet why dont cha?Oh I forgot your **** ******** is   damn **** limp|`|3a6823ce91c7f2901ad691610e4ab870aa	Hard as the task may be, we should all just try to ignore this guy.

Maybe he was breastfed until he was 6 years old.  Who knows?  The only thing that's obvious is that he needs some professional psychological help.  He's either 10 years old, and just looking to create trouble.

I answered a tennis question yesterday with a comment on Roger and his crying and I received many thumbs down...but at least you see the humour in it!|`|JEMtVVkBaa	my goodness this was 2 nights ago and there have been over 50 questions on this, or related to this already!!    He didnt cry because he lost, its because he felt that he dissapointed the ones who mean so much to him. He still took Nadal to 5 sets...are you saying that you have never cried in your whole life?    Imagine if you won 13 grand slams and came THAT CLOSE from equalling your hero's record....how would you feel HONESTLY?    how do you know that Tiger or Beckham let their emotions run a little behind the scenes? Federer proved how much it ment to him and GOOD ON HIM. because it takes a REAL MAN to do what he did!    edit: the guy who rebutted me - because it takes a MAN WITH BALLS (and not tennis balls) to open up like that!!|`|Sca69Krvaa	I'd rather have a cry than pick my **** constantly on national TV....|`|Qd6mOb1saa	lol.  This is one of the funniest questions I've seen in a long time.  I couldn't agree more.  Roger can get Kleenex tissue sponsor in a heartbeat.

rZmiyAqJaa	BECAUSE THOSE TEAMS DON'T PLAY DEFENSE!|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	i disagree that kobe plays like jordan. no one can compare to jordan. the answer to your question is teams like the knicks and the raptors do not apply enough defensive pressure. they are undisciplined. lets not forget about the bobcats though. this is a team that has figured out the lakers.|`|GsqQ4UTnaa	I am tired of the same questions when will everyone realize that Kobe is Kobe, LeBron is LeBron, and Jordan is Jordan. They all play different styles of basketball and therefore difficult to compare. Jordan was amazing, played like a bully with the intimidation, emotion, and athleticism. Kobe plays like a army general, he's very strategic yet not as physical of a player compared to Jordan or LeBron. Kobe has a wide arsenal of moves to find a way to score on you. LeBron plays more like Jordan and is on track to be better than Jordan by the time he retires. The only way Lebron wouldn't surpass Jordan would be if James decides to retire 3 times in the middle of his career.|`|R2MxcVDSaa	I don't think the Knicks are that bad...  They're only 1 game from the 8th spot.    Maybe the Raptors were not as good,but they still made the playoffs next year so I don't think they're "terrible"|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Because ALL OTHER TEAMS R TERRIBLE VS LAKERS    So The 82 Games That Kobe Plays R VS Teribble Teams|`|D6Llh23Baa	kobe plays extremely well when inspired to do so. bynum's loss affected lakers' chances of winning the championship so kobe felt like he had something to prove.|`|oMSTg5rQaa	Less defensive pressure

Rafa is playing BEST right now NO DOUBT abt that & I hope HE CONTINUE 2 DO SO,bt that doesn't exclude the fact that Roger is 1 of the BEST in men's tennis.& this is the 1st time I saw Roger cried after LOOSING a match(he cried b4 after winning bt this is sad...).    RAFA himself felt Roger's emotion & was soooo suportive,soooooo IF UR A REAL RAFA FAN show some decency man.|`|6W4vcjFhaa	Are you crazy.  The man should his emotions because he lost to a great player and also because some of the greats were there to see him win his 14th.  He felt he let them down.  Federer can beat Nadal all he needs is to get a trainer.  Roger has being training himself for most of his career and has for the first time really challenged.  He now knows he cannot do it by himself and need outside help.|`|uX09rPGlaa	Roger Federer is the best tennis player who ever lived. He has won 13 majors unlike Nadal. I hope you realize that Nadal only got to be number one after Roger had mono and was really sick for a long time. Just because someone gets upset doesn't mean that he is a cry baby. That's such a stupid. immature thing to say. Nadal would never say anything like that. He is friends with Roger and if he can respect him why can't you.|`|RC4K4TQ4aa	definately... the crybaby is crying because he doesn't get the silverspoon prize money.

I'm sure Federer sure expected to win the tournament easily...humiliating, disappointed and he couldn't control the crying spell. Well, we have witnessed a very unusual AO final ceremony, to say the least. p.s Rafa's bitter loss after 2007 Wimbledon, his eyes were bit swollen, but never cried, until he reached the locker room  with Toni chiding him, this in my opinion is a true young champ with a considerate,appropriate emotional behavior.|`|4esOOErCaa	dude who cares  come on, get over it. im as much of a rafa fan as you are, but theres no reason to disrespect federer like that. federer is still gonna go down as one of the all time greats of tennis (the fact he cried isn't going to stop that)    for nadal? well only time will tell if he can equal (or better) federer's achievements..|`|b70XH245aa	totaly dude...dont forget a pacifier lol...ya man its just a game..wow ....crybaby..who knows mabe next time the tennis court would get flooded..|`|ZLPVUQ1caa	dude...you have some serious issues...
Lp3SNWHoaa	So Many people ask this question, and Ive answered it before:    Yes. I think That night Roger lost the mental game against Rafa .you could tell from the shaky start after that two awesome matches he played, and the fact that he could barely take his break points, and the poor games he played at the 5th set ... it's obvious that he fears of losing the match against Nadal and I think he thinks about it all the time during the match and thats why he makes so many unforced errors against Rafa. I think he needs a coach (just about Nadals case) just to train him mentally, How to play against Nadal and how to overcome his fear of losing to him.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	agree|`|3jBUJxOdaa	Somehow all the beatings he has taken from Nadal leaves a mark on his confidence. Especially because Federer has been so used to winning that it would naturally become extremely hard for him to cope with being dominated. With his game, he can definitely beat everybody, including Nadal. With almost equally, albeit extremely different, great talents arguably crossing out each other, a game between Nadal and Federer always boils down to who is tougher mentally, which Nadal always end up having the edge. As I saw Federer cry on the trophy presentation of AO, I just realized, that for him, it seems either that he can create an inspiration out of his losses against Nadal and make a winning formula out of it, or that he continues to loose confidence. But surely Federer, being the player that he is, will find a way to overcome this.|`|d19d6d11466a952bf245413b8442de9eaa	I think the same, at his best Federer can beat anyone on any surface its just he has some mental block when he faces Nadal. Even If you look at this final, I think Federer should have won the match in 4 sets but he made mistakes on big occasions.|`|w8fP7aBNaa	i just realised this but federer is a mentally fragile pu$$Y that cries and his nutsack falls off when rafa puts him under pressure!|`|Elg7pnWiaa	Completely agree. Federer has probably the best technique in history hitting the ball, drive or backhand strikes. And he has improved his mobility in the court a lot, as we all have seen in Australia's final. But Nadal has got the status of kind of a nemesis for him, but I think that this 2009 season Roger will find the way to beat him in Wimbledon or in US Open. Unfortunately, no chances for him in Paris. We'll see and enjoy whatever it happens.|`|3I6q9ZgEaa	I would say yeah, its gotten to a point where I feel Fed would have no shot at the grand slam record unless Nadal loses to someone else or is injured.     That being said, I say Fed has a good chance at the US open title this year.

At the level of your play, you should always be demoing a racquet before buying.    If demoing isn't an option, you should know what range of specs you want.  If it falls into that category, then sure, why not.  But if you can't demo, you should at least read some reviews of it and other similar frames before buying.  If people seem to like it, then I see nothing wrong with getting it.

They weigh in at 123lbs, there are a 40 or so of them actively competeting in Pro MMA.    The current champion of the only well known organziation (Shooto) that has a flyweight division is Shinichi Kojima.  http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Shinichi-...

is0myvrHaa	i think maybe your reading too much into this..maybe he is just better as a lone striker, and keane just didn't settle well at anfield, and yeah torres may be a lone stiker, but it works for liverpool, look how well they played at chelsea, that was the best they have played in a while, i just dont think rafa benitez, particularly liked keane and he just didnt fit in with their plans, or line up..in my opinion he was and unnessacary signing, they would have been better off with barry.|`|duJgBxUoaa	Who cares?  He's the one that scores goals!|`|HEEXkiihaa	i already mention earlier in another post that keane saga was the bad feud bet rafa and perry. rafa wanted barry from villa but perry wanted keane and obviously the board supported perry which pissed rafa off. so rafa refused to play keane ..has nothing to do with torres...and i think torres is fine being a lone striker.

uPFRukGNaa	if you keep it up you'll end up looking lean and ripped rather than body builder huge, but you'll probably still develop a well defined body
J6xmZqj1aa	Swimming is probably the best sport for all around fitness, and you will defiantly not lose any fitness, or muscle. Swimming the breast stoke is great.  how you look will not affect how you preform.  How you train and preform will have an effect on how you look.  I don't know the specifics of fighting and the type of fitness it results in but you will not be as good of a fighter if you don't fight.  Runners typically don't have much of an upper body(and the breast stroke requires an extremely strong upper body, the pecs in particular, which will not help you run.  I struggle with that myself) but if you continue to swim, and/or you do the shorter events you will need a strong upper body.  But you can't be the best in both, they both require specific body types, and training.  Good Luck I'm sorry if that didn't help much and Keep up the swimming
z7JsVzcnaa	Reps = repetitions.  If you were doing bench press, for example, if you raise the bar 10 times, each time is a repetition.  A set is a certain number of repetitions.  3 sets of 10 repetitions would mean that you do 10 repetitions 3 times (break in between each set)
xjXxs92caa	I'm a cricketer too great sport.
dqPdoiSYaa	Too many rising stars to name, but i'll just pick two from them- JP Duminy and Shaun Marsh.    JP Duminy has been performing fantastically right from the word Go. Though he's been contributing pretty much every time for South Africa since the last 1 year, in his Australian series he had been at his best. He has been contributing in all the 3 formats consistently. And has obviousely played a huge part in all the victories that SA achieved in 2008.    Shaun Marsh has been playing equally well for Australia since his debut. In his first ever inning in an ODI, he showed a lot of character by making a maiden 80+ score. Since then he's been a rich form and has been scoring runs at a consistent basis for Australia. He is even a great striker of the ball when needed, and has given Australia some flying starts many times.|`|AA11088802	YES ... duminy and raina|`|JdNhezdIaa	jesse ryder wait and see this kids gonna be a superstar|`|AMqmSjqraa	I think the best emerging young player at the moment is ishant sharma because with every match he is improving and the best thing is he is picking vital wickets at the vital time which is most important for the team|`|AA10976046	Shaun Marsh is good.  IPL was good for him too.|`|dXITTfHsaa	For me it would be that Sri Lanken spinner Ajantha Mendis, his stats are amazing... but maybe in a few years batsmen may have figured out how to play him.
VWLtJoX2aa	He should be punished just like a normal citizen but I ask you this.  Would he have been photographed and caught in the first place if he was a normal citizen.    As far a a role model goes, he's only 23 going on 18.  Most kids role models are younger than 18, playing an even younger character on Disney channel.  At least Michael Phelps is not fake.  So he screwed up.  His life isn't scripted to be perfect.  NO role model is perfect!|`|b819b870c70c7d8b59b6b8a1323815e3aa	What Phelps did was, for someone who is in his position, just plain stupid.    Although he did not choose the fame, he did choose to go for eight golds which brings along with it fame.  So, he needs to be careful about with whom he associates.      He'll likely pay a financial price for what he did ... and he deserves that loss.|`|PRZinmV0aa	I am a mom and I know my opinion will cause a stir but...Michael is human.  The photo was taken back in November so I am not quite sure how he can be charged with something especially for smoking pot.  Now if he went and killed someone I could see it.  But for everyone making a big deal about it.  I don't know.  I smoked pot when I was younger...a lot of people do and did.  I even know people who have pics of themselves smoking.  I know he is "famous" but that isn't going to stop people.

JD40e1Sdaa	Hit the heavy bag|`|apr9gsgjaa	Nui Gong will help! meditate and controll your energy!!!!!|`|gBO908P6aa	Work on the pads and heavy bag for shin conditioning.  You may bruise a little the first few times but you will get used to it and you won't be breaking any bones or causing any knots in your shins.    Yes it can work with other bones but remember that body hardening is a gradual process.  This means you shouldn't go out and try to smash bricks with your fists and elbows without progressive training first.|`|542f083870f223d0b28da159d53d1054aa	Traditional Thai boxers often take a bamboo stalk and split it almost all the way in half, and then lightly tap it up and down their shins a few minutes a day . You can also fill a sock with dry beans and condition your ribs by lightly swinging from side to side taping back and forth.

eBGGXGBxaa	The nice thing about picnics is that they are simple!  They don't have to be involved or complicated.  I'm sure your friend will recognize the effort you have made and will very much appreciate the gesture!      If you're nervous, keep the food simple but fresh (think fresh breads, in season fruits and vegies).     Next, pick your location.  Depending on where you live you could have a great outdoor winter picnic (along with a hike, skate or ski).  Or if it is too cold (or you're not an outdoors person), look for a nice indoor spot (any botanical gardens in your city?  Your living room by the fireplace?   A nice hotel lobby with a garden setting or fireplace?)|`|QZjTrKlsaa	Um ... If you really like her and want to be more than friends then you should find a romantic spot in the hills.  Next you should pack exquisite food and drink.  Next start things off with a joke to lighten the mood and make it less awkward.   keep talking at all times and never have awkward silences,try not to make a joke at her expense or offend her and finally,agree with her (you'll have more fun this way)  Anyway hope this helps!!!
GswnLKtQaa	Mayo is a very good rookie, he's leader the rooks in scoring and is top candidates of ROY but he's playing of the memphis grizzlies and not alot of poeple care but the griz. while Rose though playing really well also, plays for the bulls a glamore team in the NBA so he gets more attention.    Jefferson numbers are great he's a double double machine but he's in a losing team. he'll gain more respect if they win more games.|`|ebD1plKNaa	LeBraun James was drafted by a really sucky team and they instantly became playoff contenders as long as he plays for them.

vzH7f7V5aa	There are 15 Teams in each Confrence and the 8 Teams with the best Record from each Confrence makes it. There are 4 Rounds The First Round The Semi-Finals The Confrence Finals and The NBA Finals. In the First Round there are 8 Teams in each Confrence The Semi-Finals have Four Teams in each Confrence The Confrence Finals have the Final Two Teams in each Confrence and The NBA Finals have One Team from Each Confrence. Every Round is called the Best of Seven Series which means they will Play Seven Games at the most. The Least that will ever be Played is Four.|`|GswnLKtQaa	in the NBA, the Playoffs is where the top 8 teams of the east and west division play in a round elimination for the nba championship.    there are four rounds. each team plays a best of seven series which the first to win 4 advance. if your beat 4 teams during the playoffs you become champs.    Season and Playoffs are different because in the playoffs, the better team simply win because teams are going to expose your weaknesses.    in the season players can make their name, but in the playoffs they can make their fame.|`|ebD1plKNaa	Playoff is another word for tournament.  The better teams in each division based on their overall win-loss record make it into the playoffs.  In the NBA, eight teams from the Eastern Conference and eight from the Western Conference make the playoffs.  They are ranked based on that same win-loss record with the three division winners being one, two and three in each conference.  Then the teams play a series of best of seven again each other, the number one ranked team against the number eight, the number two against the number seven and so on.  The winners of the best of seven series then move to the next round and do it again.  The losers go home.  Eventually, they end up with one team from each conference.  Those two teams play each other for the NBA Championship and are crowned as the Champions for that season.  The first team to win sixteen games in the playoffs is the winner.    Playoffs in other leagues such as high school and college usually only play one game to advance, instead of a series.

Maybe what you could do if you don't mind the phone calls is put your name and number on the flier and have people call ahead and RSVP sorta thing so you know if your going to have enough kids.

OHs8yJiOaa	People actually tend to maintain better form when they go faster, and remain lighter on their feet.    Going slower, you were likely "sitting back" more, and it's likely you were heel striking more, dropping your weight and rolling through with longer foot-ground contact, etc.... probably running more from your legs themselves than from your core.    You may just need to re-establish your form when going slower and more consciously stay off your heels and not power through things with them alone. I'd expect whether or not you strengthen your legs or injure them depends on you and your particular form. With a little practice at a slower pace, you'll likely figure out what works for you and what doesn't. You may just need to more consciously pay attention to your hips, etc. in the early stages.|`|gGNKMqUNaa	running slower willbuild up your stamina and if you just begin, you must run slower and for long distances and this will help you in training for 4-5 k and never let you down

38619f0f81204837c01cf800f96fba31aa	who knows  Theres a heck of a lot of clubs (7) separated by 2 points, theoretically I don't think the clubs  on under 30 are safe, although it does look like Fulham and above are probablyt safer than others.    football is about confidence and team spirit and cohesion, soemthign that stoke seem to have in spades. Its quite possible that any club, from Wigan down could have a crisis and start to loose matches meaning the teram get more nervous and loose more matches. at 3 points a win y'never know.    the theoretical safety is at 40 points, so Stoke need another 16 points out of the 42 available to them.    History tells us that usually 2 out of the promoted teams tend to go down, but hull are only 4 points above stoke.    I think West Brom are probably doomed, Boro may escape, Portsmouth have a sir of despondancy about them. but there are lots of clubs dicing with death at presetn  including Tittenham, Newcsatle. I think Bolton are probably safe, but Blackburn may well go down, unless fat Sam pull shis finger out.    ultimately its only a game.|`|p8lB73rdaa	Why not ?

Stoke are a much better team at home and have steadily gained points throughout the season with 2 draws against Liverpool.    They seem much more consistent than Hull who blasted themselves up the ladder at the beginning of the season.    But with the January transfer window just ending it will be interesting to see how the teams new mid season players make a difference Stoke have signed Matthew Etherington and James Beattie with Henri Camara and Stephen Kelly on loan.    The two signings are very strong ones for Stoke with both already bagging points for the team.    Looking at other teams Stoke did quite well and I think they will survive the drop zone especially if they can win the odd game away.    Tips for the drop:  20th - WBA  19th - Hull City    18th is very tough because so many things can happen with teams pulling it out of the bag right at the end of the season and with such a close ladder now it is hard to pick.    But the facts state that on most occasions 1 promoted team survives the drop with the other 2 looking average I think Stoke will survive.|`|i8OSR1A2aa	i think they have a great chance and they are not relying too much on delap's throw ins anymore, so yes they can, but i cant guarantee.  signed some good players aswell.|`|OW2etH4Waa	everybody has a chance|`|w7Vozy8Jaa	I'd like one of the promoted clubs to stay up with us,I'd love Manchester  or Tottenham to finish 18th|`|skgN9TJLaa	There is every chance of survival yes, but there is also every chance of relegation sorry. As things are i can see Hull getting dragged into serious danger,they've done well but were never going to maintain the early form, Portsmouth,Middlesbrough could easily be relegated but they could have new managers soon. My prediction 20th W.B.A 19th Hull City 18th Portsmouth or Stoke, lets hope Portsmouth.|`|293ec7374db7aa5b7a962316a54f108daa	I think so yes.  They are gaining in confidence having had some tricky times along the way, and they are pretty good at home.  In fact, they have some winable home games coming up, and that is where their destiny lies.  If you are going to stay up, you need to find 3 teams worse off than you, and I would say West Brom (not quite good enough) Middlesborough (can't score) and Portsmouth (in quite a rut) could be those three.

The opening game often offers a major shock. Look at Senegal beating France last time and Cameroon beating Argentina in 1990, there is a precedence.    2. Costa Rica have an unpredictable style. Germany is well organised, but Paolo Wanchope and co. could spring a suprise.    3. The German team is over rated. They have a couple of top class players, the rest are nothing special.    As I say, I still think that Germany are favourites, but I may consider placing a bet after having a quick look at the odds.

Ceca l' attaccante azzurro ha dimostrato troppo individualismo, guardiamo solo il gol aveva Barone di fianco a se liberissimo e solo per la "gloria personale"(se cos pu definirsi un gol in 11 contro 10 alla Rep.Ceca) ha cercato un dribbling che per poco non gli riusciva.  Lippi secondo me ha fatto questa considerazione:  l' Italia attuale deve giocare di squadra perch effettivamente di individualit che possano cambiare la partita non ne ha, quindi tiene in panca Inzaghi per farglielo capire.  Visto che Inzaghi  un giocatore di esperienza penso che l' abbia capito e non  detto che la prossima partita non sia il suo momento.

Del Piero non ha giocato male nelle sue apparizioni a questo mondiale. Per carit, forse non  pi il fuori classe di un tempo, ma a mio avviso ha giocato molto meglio di tanti altri giocatori. Inoltre, non credo sia corretto dire che Del Piero "ruba" il posto ad Inzaghi, visto che i due giocatori hanno caratteristiche diverse ed il loro impiego dipende principalmente dallo schema tattico che decide l'allenatore. Non  un caso se contro l'Australia, dopo l'espulsione di Materazzi, Lippi ha fatto entrare un difensore al posto di Toni e non di Del Piero (che non  un attaccante puro).

They may want to learn to play flag or two hand touch.    The link below is for the standard tackle version.|`|eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	What?!

E' giusto comunque che come ha detto qualcuno prima di me, si esalti il gruppo, Totti compreso (che a mio avviso nell'ultima partita ha giocato dei palloni veramente belli).   Se vuoi un mio parere personale su Toni, ti dico che a me non piace; preferisco Inzaghi, (sono juventino di nascita, e bisogna dare atto del valore di ogni singolo giocatore,  epoi mi pare che gli juventini, stiano dando un apporto grandissimo alla squadra, cos come i milanisti, e i giocatori della roma. Onore al merito a questa squadra che ci sta facendo sognare), che  un vero cobra per le sue giocate velenose, e per la sua velocit, a differenza di Toni che  lento, e se riparte in contropiede da centrocampo arriva davanti alla porta stanchissimo, un po come Vieri.|`|5c0f73e03fa9e1574e5f402e09fef788aa	Esaltono Toni perch  stato l'unico attaccante che quando ha giocato nel suo ruolo ha fatto una doppietta!!!  Saranno stati anche gol facili ma se non si trovava in quelle posizioni a dettare i passaggi non avremmo vinto 3-0,  chiaro che bisogna dare onore anche agli altri giocatori che hanno fatto ottimi cross...ma ognuno ha il suo ruolo.  In quello schema Toni doveva essere pronto a far gol quando ne aveva l'occasione, mentre nelle altre partite ha avuto meno occasioni perch ha giocato pi indietro.|`|64e21c8dee9fcb10c78972b76a0a3ef9aa	Lo esaltano perch pensano che possa fare come Rossi al Mondiale...|`|341425c89d9a09fde211b266888e2633aa	forse non hai seguito il campionato oppure non hai visto le partite precedenti....

Stagione 2003/2004 - 28 Goals  Stagione 2004/2005 - 20 Goals  Stagione 2005/2006 - 31 Goals    In tutto fanno 79 reti in 3 campionati.

Certo che per segnare tanti goals, pi o meno difficili, serve anche avere compagni che fanno buoni assists...ma anche a farsi trovare a 30cm o 50cm dalla porta bisogna esser capaci, avere il senso della posizione di un buon attaccante.|`|f73047d7938ead240d42e5b504e87b9baa	perch Toni  un animale d' area, attaccante pi forte in circolazione...altro che Iaquinta!|`|aee18a353006c7dd034984760d438164aa	io sono pienamente daccordo con te. per me lo esaltano solo perche  il capocannoniere... toni quest'anno  una delusione al mondiale, mi aspettavo di pi dal nostro capocannoniere...|`|3ad36a45ea1ba70dedc2bf96e138e940aa	Sono perfettamente daccordo. Toni ha fatto si due gol facili ma quanti se ne  magiati?(contro la republica ceca ha fatto un colpo di testa con la zona "scoppa" ed  alto 2 metri!!!).Per uno che fa il suo ruolo mangiarsi gol vuol dire stare fuori(deve fare solo quello).  Meglio Inzaghi allora: una occasione un gol!!!|`|a5384b73064a2ef923f492cf872e28b4aa	Xk ha fatto gol...|`|d5923f3a5d2e0e1e9faff52370d489d8aa	 il suo anno segna anche da casa mentre sta seduto sul cesso  (vedi vecchia pubblicit di sky).  giusto che giochi anche se non  un fenomeno

Germany plays at home, and so they could be favorized. They're both playing better and better, I'll say my favourite is Italy in the extra-time because they played less than the germans, and their last match was easier. Anyway it's not hard to predict who'll be the winner, the only thing I'm sure about is it's gonna be tough.  Our defence is really good, our striker, Toni seems to be self-confident now... As Germany's defence isn't as good as ours, why not?|`|7594d46179150648b1fc5820d94d4e68aa	Vedendo molta gente parlare della Germania, che poi giocano in casa, vinceranno loro.|`|7b583cd74b1d7b84758d0d413128bf4daa	spero l'italia  ce la possiamo fare  just keep on dreamin'...|`|3bc2610b70f7fccb12ad42f5198a7461aa	Ma che domanda ????????E' ovvio che la Germania vinca.Questa squadra ha vinto contro delle vere squadre nella fase finale di questo mondiale che sono l' argentina e la Svezia e non come l Italia che ha sconfitto 2 squadre che per la prima volta si sono qualificate....quindi in semifinale l' Italia incontrer la prima squadra che e una vera squadra e non dei giocatori da campetto.Klose infiler una doppietta e Ballack chiuder i conti.La Germania voler in finale con un netto 3-0 su una squadra che non meritava nemmeno di qualificarsi a questa fase finale di coppa del mondo.|`|add8e0155c0c4925c9bc92699280206aaa	L'Italia sta + riposata xk a giocato con squadre di merda e a vinto e  perci stanno + riposati invece germania a fatto partite + difficili e perci e stanno + stanki per spero ke vinca la germania l'italia spero proprio di no|`|89ac0216679379bef042736fa714ee16aa	ma sembra che adesso sia colpa nostra che l' italia abbia affrontato squadre meno quotate, e poi non vedo una cos netta differenza tra ucraina e svezia, secondo il vostro ragionamento posso dire che la svezia a pareggiato con il trinidad, che la svizzera a pareggiato con la francia, che la germania  in casa e ha sudato con la polonia...cio non voglio togliere e favorire nessuno ma questi discorsi non stanno ne in cielo e ne in terra.  Siamo in un mondiale, chi fa goal passa, e in semifinale ci siamo,  nell' 82 avevamo la polonia in semifinale( la meno quotata a diff. dell' altra semifinale) e abbiamo vinto il torneo.  secondo voi quindi passando contro squadre pi quotate dimostrano anche che sono pi forti di noi!...ma dove sta la logica in sto discorso???? :-)    ciao|`|e899a337f18c53f2f6588339e3f39e20aa	Difficile dirlo.. la Germania  favorita perch 1) gioca in casa 2) ha battuto l'Argentina; anche se bisogna dire che avendo battuto gli argentini i Tedeschi saranno s, molto pi sicuri di se stessi, ma saranno anche stanchi dopo un partitone che  addirittura andato a finire ai rigori.. mentre invece l'Italia  praticamente andata in crociera giocando contro l'Ucraina e quindi i nostri saranno pi freschi e (si spera) svegli.

As for faking injuries.  I think the number of "faked" injuries is actually relatively low but the number of very minor injuries that are greatly embellished by melodramtics is pretty high.  Moreover, there is no question that some teams use it more than others but I don't think any team is totally exempt.|`|7d2fc69bb3b31a1fbb42a766647997d1aa	All the teams fake that the other team tripped them but it's pretty hard to fake real INJURIES.

AA12162975	You cannot always say that they are jealous of Italy. It's a natural reaction if their team is beaten. It's their competitive spirit that made those immature reactions.

I don't know why they all hate Italy.  They're just jealous because Italy has teamwork, skill, and love for the game.  EXACTLY! THEY ONLY WISH THEY WERE ITALIAN!

Our culture is beautiful, and these people vandalized our flag....(cough cough) a Mexican kid, said that we copied their flag...First of all ours was made 100 years before them, and where were they in the Roman times...seriously..I'm not racist..they should shut the hell up because they spit at us in the block and booed when they won yesterday, if those men saw them, I don't think they would of survived...My dad was about to run out and kick their @sses...People should stop making fun of Italians...I'm proud of being Italian...OH man...I wish Italy wins the world cup they deserve it...FORZA ITALIA!!!

Jealousy is when someone envy's another person or team because of their achievements. Some may think Italy does not have many achievements but the friendly's and world cup history prove them wrong. Also u have the euro's and qualifications for tournaments that can add to their wall of achievments. Again all the other teams (maybe accept France) have lost or haven't won convincingly  (Portugal-cheaters and cant even play). Brazil lost to France and they are just angry and jealous. The US is just there for show, and Germany lost to the world's best football team. How could one not be jealous of such a team.  Portuguese are the luckiest cheaters ever. Hope they die!!!

f345dd3fcac3cde89cdf484a4bc109a6aa	mah, a me la tattica  apparsa chiara, azzardata ma, visti i risultati direi geniale. Prima Lippi ha fatto giocare a tutto campo, poi, quando le punte accusavano un po' la stanchezza, ha lasciato caricare di responsabilit la difesa e facendo sfiancare i tedeschi, infine ha effetuato le sostituzioni attaccando pesantemente i tedeschi ormai cotti, vincendo in un tripudio. Ha vinto, come fare  criticare? Tony  un grande giocatore, per 90 minuti a attaccare sfiancherebbero chiunque. Ha fatto il suo lavoro, l'ha fatto magnificamente, era preventivato che probabilmente non avrebbe raccolto la gloria. Ha fatto il portatore d'acqua, servono anche quelli.  In defintiva, FORZA ITALIA.|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	x' ha fatto una cazzata e insiste a lascir su totti anche se combina poco....ha la testa dura marcello, ma se questo vuol dire arrivare in finale e magari vincerla...ben venga!!!  cmq a parte gli scherzi...toni va lasciato su!!|`|a724f4b81946384ec62905614514d57faa	Perch forse non ha giocato bene?

Con una squadra pi offensiva avrebbe meno problemi in merito.  In prospetiva finale, vosto come gioca la Fracia, il gioco di Gilardino, pi rapido del Luca Nazionale, potrebbe essere migliore a conti fatti, ma non credo che Lippi se ne privi proprio all'ultimo.|`|4f958f1607a2c14f1b22512f9a5d5008aa	non c'e' una spiegazione che possiamo fornirti in quanto non siamo lippi e non percepiamo il suo stipendio per fare quelle scelte (ah dimenticavo parte dello stipendio lo fornisce uno degli sponsor di totti) capisci a me|`|375fbfdaa161f765a6e5d411c195449aaa	a parte ke nn  stato sostituito a met partita,ma mi sembra(nn vorrei sbagliarmi) verso il settantesimo.cmq credo ke  stato sostituito xke avevamo bisogno di piu movimento d'avanti e toni visto ke fino a quel momento aveva corso tantissimo sembrava un po stanco ed effettivamente lo era.  poi penso ke totti nn sia stato sostituito xke lippi pensava ai rigori e sinceramente visto cm stavano giocando le 2 squadre in molti pensavano ke fossero arrivati ai rigori.|`|1a182d8246afdaf583dba4439b003c61aa	toni ha fatto una buona partita pero aveva sprecato tutte le energie .luca[] sei un troglodita|`|7e984e8b89dc090baa1cc9c05a550055aa	magari c' una finale da giokare???   voi ke ne dite se si riposa???|`|aeb5db6597cb172d56224a6d85defe65aa	sicuramente perch era stanco ha fatto tante corse......

7370d95ae8122fd98a8e6db8c03f7174aa	Theoreticaly a .22 of good quality is the best, that way you can practice more due to cheap ammo, and recoil is almost non existent. The problem is, a .22 becomes boring quickly, and most handgun shooters throw them in a drawer and forget about them, after a few weeks. Centrefire handguns make more noise, kick more, usually are heavier(and feel more like a real gun) so are generally considered more fun. As for accuracy, the best are .38 specials that fire wadcutter bullets(flat tip, cut a perfectly round hole, also coincidentally have very little recoil.) Typically, most .38 specials are revolvers, although the Smith and Wesson Model 41 is the slickest and most accurate semi-auto on the planet! More important than which model to choose, is which grip size and shape. The accuracy of any handgun depends on how compfortably and consistently you can hold it. It must fit in the exact same place in your hand every time you hold it. Find a handgun that has the best feeling grip size, grip angle, and length of trigger pull for you. Different grips from Pachmayr and Hogue(to name a couple) can make that grip slightly fatter or slightly thinner, or slightly longer from palm to trigger, or slightly shorter, to fit you perfectly. Then you just need practice and an accurate load. Smith and Wesson generally dominates the revolver field (for accuracy) and they have several different model sizes from "J" frames, bigger and heavier up to "N" frames. not only is each size bigger and heavier, but they generally have a difference balance point. "J" frames tend to sit in your hand like a tennis ball, "N" frames tend to be barrel heavy, like holding a axe or hatchet. Try as many differeent frame sizes as possible before buying, unless you need an excuse to own several!|`|AA11691061	what form of target shooting?

AA10826150	I haven't yo-yo'd in years, but I would recommend a Duncan yo-yo.  I could always find them almost anywhere.|`|AA11352526	ur brother is kinda wacko|`|AA11594714	you can look at the site below if you want|`|82971025cb63ff232aaac47ea623c0d8aa	My first job was at the world's largest yo-yo museum.  I'll help you out. ;)    Duncan is the brand that everyone knows, but they actually are pretty crappy yo-yos.  It happened because they got bought out by a plastics company that has little to no interest in making a good yo-yo.      The company that I used to work for was Playmaxx, but they also got bought out by Duncan.  However, I believe their most popular products - ProYo II, and the Bumblebee - are still available.  The ProYo II has a wooden axle, and is what I would recommend for anyone to start off on.  It's also very good for looping tricks - loop the loop, punching bag, etc.  Once s/he can do a slew of tricks on the ProYo, then I'd recommend a Bumblebee.  It has a ball bearing for an axle, so it's excellent for sleeping tricks - atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, etc.  Between those two yo-yos, your brother should be good for a long time.    I'd highly discourage against stuff like Yomega Brain.  It has a centripetal clutch, which means it sleeps until it hits a specific rpm, and then returns to your hand.  However, that means it's only good for really basic sleeping tricks.  At the museum, I saw a lot of kids get hurt when they were in the middle of a minorly complicated sleeping trick and the brain returned unexpectedly, hitting them pretty hard.  Besides, the brain ends up doing to the trick for you, and that's no fun.    As far as tricks go, I've seen a number of websites that offer some instruction.  I'm sure he could easily find several sources.    Good luck to him!  :)

AA11225694	There are two factors in being prepared. One is the actual physical and mental preparedness of the defenders body and mind who will attempt to block the shot. Second, is their defensive position on the court relative to the offensive player attempting to score.    Physically the defender should be on the balls of their feet with knees slightly flexed and the hands in an up position as if they were preparing to rebound the ball. You have only a fraction of a second to react getting a hand extended to block or deflect a shot once it has left the shooters hand. If it takes you another half second to raise your hand from a low position you can forget getting that block. I believe as well that the body and feet should be fairly square to the offensive player taking the shot. I have watched many big young shot blockers turn their body sideways to attempt a block. This creates three negatives for the shot blocker. First it is difficult to elevate to your maximum when your body is turned sideways and your shoulders are not essentially parallel to your hips. Second, by turning the body sideways you are opening yourself up to a shot fake and step through move by the attacking play. Finally, in most cases the offensive player is more easily able to draw body contact from the defender because their feet are not in a position to react and move in any direction creating air space between the shooter and shot blocker. This commonly results in a foul by the defender.    When the defender attempting to block the shot is a help defender their physical position must be one splitting the distance between the player they are defending and the attacking offensive player. This is exactly the same situation as a two on one in the open court. If the helping defender must adjust their position on the penetration or post move by the attacking player in their direction, they will not be prepared to react, move and recover if the attacking player dumps the pass to the player they are guarding. The helping defender may come further off their player the more pressure that is exerted on the attacking post or penetrating player and the less court vision that player has been able to maintain.    The Technique  While on the balls of their feet, with knees flexed (energy in the legs), and hands facing upward at about eye level the defender will begin to slightly extend the arm attempting to block the ball as the offensive player begins to elevate. As soon as the ball leaves the attackers hands toward the basket the defender explodes off the floor raising the arm to full extension and flicking at the ball with the finger tips of the hand just enough so that the ball may be deflected and possession retained by the shot blocker. Many young players think it's flashy to swat the ball completely out of bounds. But as a coach I am not too happy if the offensive team scores on the next possession after in-bounding a ball blocked out of bounds. That same block essentially becomes as offensive rebound put back and negates the block. Bill Russell in my eyes was the best shot blocker I have ever seen and there have been many talented one's. I don't have any percentages but I would bet that more than 50% of Bill Russell's defensive blocked shots ended up in his hands. That my coaching and playing friends is a shot blocker.    We could have an extended discussion about which hand to use to block a shot. My thoughts on this are that if you have a very talented athlete, long-arms, great timing, and solid on defense who blocks consistently well with one specific hand let them develop that skill. If however, your tall player is somewhat less talented you should consider having them challenge attackers shots with the hand on the same side as the attacker has the ball going to the basket. If the player can't explode off the flour to block a shot, they certainly can cause a player to alter their shot and reduce their shooting percentage. This is best accomplished by challenging the shot with the arm on the same side as the shooters release. This also makes it less likely the defender will rotate the body and get out of position to react and move in any direction and any point in time while defending the attacking player.|`|c8d300d2f90e4af46419f57b2bf8b957aa	timing is everything when a guy bends it's 2 knees w8 until he takes of the ground just when he moves his hands block it.

If she's having fun, thats all that really matters!|`|d84d1646c1d27d369f6ba7ea2f38594eaa	Depends on how you'll play. If you'll are in a competition (school, college, pro, etc) she should definitely quit or be dropped from the team by the coach/captain (depending who makes the decision of the starting squad)    but if you'll play for fun (friends, Physical education, etc.) she definitely should play coz this will help her improve.    Remember, sports were made for relaxation; we converted them to profeesional work. So, let her have fun or else, kick her butt.      Why don't you porctice with her and help her. I was real bad at soccer. I played with a person on the middle school team, got better and now am the captain of my high school team.    So go ahead and help her, rather than criticize her over the internet!!!!|`|937c56a26f7574a8108136ccecfd5d9aaa	help her out|`|0266b9a0a07cef3df8b69eca68b56ad2aa	If you want to know if it is fun for her to play, your best bet would be to ask her.  I have played games where I don't always win because I enjoy the game, for example.  I'm a paintball player and, while I sometimes do well, other times I don't, and when I don't it means I get shot.  I still play.  I've also had days where I was so off-my-game that I lost a round for my team.  I still have fun playing even when I lose.  My reasons are that playing is enjoyable and I like the hangout time wtih the rest of the players.    It seems to me that, when thinking of you and your teammate who is not all that skilled, the one most upset by her inability is you, not her.  Maybe helping her learn to perform better in your chosen sport would be a more productive use of your time than wondering whether she is having fun when she has apparently already made it clear that she has fun playing even without winning.|`|e706f760f5a745f8194cca3cc265e606aa	So far from your attitude, I can already see you haven't tried to help her at all... Only complain.  Some people do things for entertainment... So my advise is don't be a jackass, try to help the person, and realize not everyone is you.    And so you've lost every game? Haven't won a game yet? And this person is the SOLE reason that you have lost? Why not just play with one less person, would you win then?    Everyone has their weakest link, if not this person than maybe possibly it would be yourself (or someone else on the team).    Hope this helps!

cb5054a9a39c6a816ab0166def2eefafaa	As an ex-PBA pro, I practiced my tail off about 25 games a week, joined various scratch/handicap leagues from doubles to 5 person teams, then bowled house tournaments.  After that, I was able to keep my average at the level I needed in order to keep up with bowling with professionals.      You can definitely bowl scratch, handicap and professional leagues at the same time.  If you both feel comfortable bowling together, a doubles league would be perfect.  If you are both very social persons, then multi bowler teams will work out fine.  No limit to the fun you can have, not to mention valuable experience to boost up your averages.  Hope this helps!|`|AA12113026	if u want to bowl together, try and join a mixed league.  If you don't want to bowl together try and find different leagues that fit your schedule|`|AA11225694	You've probably heard these before, and you will without a doubt hear them again as much as we bowlers like giving advice. Any one of these alone is pretty simple, performing all of them at the same time is another story. The idea is for all of these to become automatic so that you don't have to think about any of them when you start your approach... This requires lots of practice (see tip  9).    As with any advice, use what you need and discard the rest. Don't blame me if they don't help, just send me a check if they put you on the pro tour!        1 Concentration   I have concentration listed first because without it, all of the others will not happen. Distractions, problems at home, school, or work, discomfort (such as tight clothing), and many other things contribute to you losing concentration at that last second. One thing I do is wear a watch and count to 4. It's not necessarily the extra time that helps, but this gives you a familiar object to concentrate on, and it also improves your "timing". Watch the second hand count 4 ticks, then move your eyes to your mark as you begin your approach. This will work providing you don't have to alter the position of your watch arm too much.        2 Shoulders Square   For consistent deliveries, keep your shoulders square to the foul line at all times. A "dropped" shoulder can send the ball wide every time. This often happens when you rush your approach. Maintain a moderate approach speed and be aware of your shoulders during delivery.        3 Back Straight   This is one of the most difficult things to learn how to do automatically, it seems instinctive to bend over when you set down a 16 pound object, but it is very important to keep your back reasonably straight for a consistent delivery.        4 Arm Straight And Near Body   Bending your arm at the elbow and swinging it away from your body are main contributors to an inconsistent game. A slight bend at the elbow to obtain lift is alright, as long as the inside of your elbow is pointing down your lane, and not at the snack bar.        5 Knee Bent   It might seem natural to begin your slide with a bent knee, then straighten it as you release the ball. Although this will get you more lift, it's just one more thing you have to get perfect for consistent bowling. Stay down at the foul line for higher scores.        6 Slide Straight   You absolutely must maintain your balance for proper ball delivery. In order for this to happen, you have to keep your approach and slide perpendicular to the foul line at all times.        7 Follow Through!   I had these two words engraved on one of my bowling balls as a constant reminder. This is probably the single largest contributor to consecutive poor releases. It's not hard to bowl an entire game before you realize that you are not following through. Freeze your arm after release and check it's position after your ball crosses over the mark, it should be about head high with your thumb pointing over it's own shoulder.        8 Watch Your Ball Cross The Mark   It doesn't matter whether you focus on a mark, or on an area of the lane, as long as you focus on something. "Hold that pose" until your ball crosses over that mark, this will ensure that you are not rushing out of your approach.        9 Practice, Practice, Practice   And when you've finished doing this... practice some more.  It's hard to be consistently good at anything, if you only do it once a week. Get a friend to watch your approach, or if possible, set up a video camera. You'll be surprised at what you see!        10 Have Fun!   I put this in here just in case the other nine do not work. You don't have to average 200 to have a great time!

AA11687988	Check out "Runners World" - 8/24/2000.  Following are some excerpts where they claim "running performance was boosted by 10 to 13% - AND, the team(s) ran "injury-free".    Runner's World   8/24/2000     Something extraordinary happened when a girls' high school cross-country team began a weight-lifting program directed by YMCA strength-conditioning consultant Wayne Westcott, Ph.D. The girls won the New England Cross Country Championships four years in a row  injury-free.     True, those girls may simply have been good runners  weight lifting or no weight lifting. Various studies, however, point to strength training as a major part of the team's success.     One review found that weight lifting boosted running performance by 10 to 13 percent. Another found stronger muscles boosted running economy. Westcott's own observations show that a weight-lifting program may prevent injuries.     What's more, stronger upper-body muscles help you hammer out the last mile or two of a race once you've fatigued your legs. Stronger arm and leg muscles give you more power for running uphill. And strong muscles provide better shock absorption, Westcott says.     Best of all, strength training doesn't have to take up much of your time. According to Westcott's studies, doing one set for each major muscle group just twice a week will bring significant results. Each set should include eight to 12 slow, controlled repetitions. Once you can handle 12 reps easily, increase the weight by 5 pounds.     Westcott recommends the following routine for runners. It will get you in and out of the gym within 15 minutes:     1. Bench press or pushups for chest, shoulders and triceps.     2. Leg extensions for quadriceps.     3. Bent-over or seated rows for upper back, biceps and rear shoulders.     4. Leg curls for hamstrings.     5. Overhead press or lateral raises for neck and shoulders.     6. Leg press for hamstrings, quadriceps and glutes.         The routine I use with the equipment I have at home is     Bench Press for chest, shoulders and triceps.     Leg Extensions for quadriceps.     Bent-over Rows for upper back, biceps and rear shoulders.      Leg curls for hamstrings.     Overhead press for neck and shoulders.     Half Squats for for hamstrings, quadriceps and glutes.     Calf Raises for calfs     Bicycle Sit-Up abs and lower back     My Weight Training Chart    How Many Sets Should You Do?    Runners World December 1997 pg 22    Researchers at University of Florida did a study of two groups Group A did 1 set 3 times a week , Group B did 3 sets 3 times a week, both groups showed similar and significant strength gains. Most strength will be gained in the 8 to 12 weeks.      --------------------------------------...    Found this on these Web I'm going to try it replacing the half squats weight lifting I do.     Lunges with dumbbells     Muscles - Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Gluteal muscles    Grasp a dumbbell with each hand     Hold the dumbbells at the sides of the body with arms fully extended (palms facing your torso)     Step forward with the lead leg (stepping leg), keeping the back erect     Bend the knee of lead leg until it has reached a 90-degree angle     At this point, the knee of the back leg should be approximately 2-3 inches from the floor     When fully lowered, push forcefully with the lead leg and return to the starting position     Repeat the exercise with your other leg, and continue to alternate until the desired number of repetitions is completed     Remember that a shorter lead step allows more emphasis to be placed on the quadriceps muscles and a larger step places more emphasis on the gluteal and hamstring muscles     Hope this helps.|`|AA10940204	Try going to Bill Pearl's website at www.billpearl.com.

e054a669f211bcbfbda6bdbb03261bc1aa	This is kind of random for the baseball section, but since everyone else's jokes are off topic, hope you don't mind something political!    One day, President Bush was having tea with the Queen. "How," he asked her, "do you keep your governement running so smoothly?"     "Oh, that's easy," she replied, calling Tony Blair into the room. "I just make sure that the people I surround myself with are intelligent to answer simple riddles. Watch and learn." Turning to Mr. Blair, the Queen asked, "If your Father and your Mother had a child, and it's not your brother or your sister, who is it?"    "Why, it's me, of course," Tony Blair said proudly.     "Very good," said the Queen, and turning back to President Bush, said, "and that's how I know my advisors can make logical decisions."    When he got back to the states, the first thing Dubya did was call Dick Cheney into his office. "I want you to answer this for me," W told Cheney, who nodded enthusiastically. "If your mother and your father had a child, and it's not your brother or your sister, who is it?"     Cheney, looking confused, asked the President if he could get back to him after doing some research. George consented, so Dick Cheney went around asking all the Republican senators and staff members he could find if they could answer the riddle, but none of them could. Finally, good ol' Dick ended up in the bathroom, where he recognized John Kerry's shoes under the stall. "John," called Dick, "Could you answer a riddle for me." Kerry agreed, and after hearing the riddle, responded, "Why, it's me, of course."     After thanking Mr. Kerry profusely, Mr. Cheney hurried back to Mr. Bush's office, where he told the President that he had figured out the answer to the riddle. "If my mother and my father had a child and it wasn't my brother or my sister," he began,looking very proud of himself, "it would be John Kerry!"    The President began to turn red. "No, you idiot," he yelled at his VP, "it would be Tony Blair!"|`|09fbd8be2bff23df469ed94b507b3170aa	A blonde was shopping at a Target Store and came across a silver thermos. She was quite fascinated by it, so she picked it up and brought it over to the clerk to ask what it was.    The clerk said, "That's a thermos . . . it keeps some things hot and some things cold."    "Wow, said the blonde, "that's amazing. I'm going to buy it!" So she bought the thermos and took it to work the next day.    Her boss saw it on her desk. "What do you have there?" he asked.    "Why, that's a thermos . . . it keeps hot things hot and cold things cold," she replied.    Her boss inquired, "What do you have in it?"    The blond replied, "Two Popsicles, and some coffee."|`|2560c932723a597daee30a62e2165f0aaa	So these two guys walked into a bar and had quite a few drinks when the first guy decides he needs to tell the second one something.

They then asked if he could give them a ride to another store.  As he drove them they removed their clothes and started having sex with each other.

abf216e71488c29ba55b73202ef02eacaa	Considerato che i danni subiti dalla Roma quest'anno per errori arbitrali sono quantificabili in almeno una decina di punti, mi lascia un po' perplesso il tuo avere elencato anche la Roma ;-)  Intendo dire: vista la decina di punti di cui sopra, faccio *molta* fatica a pensare che ci potesse essere un'intenzione di favorire la Roma ai danni del Cagliari (peraltro, elenchi anche un certo Racalbuto che  tristemente noto a qualsiasi romanista).  Su entrambe le partite di campionato tra Cagliari e Roma ci sono stati episodi dubbi e decisioni discutibili, sia in un verso che nell'altro; per carit, pu darsi benissimo che complessivamente la bilancia penda in favore della Roma, ma non credo che questo sia stato voluto; che siano state partite "vere" lo si vede pure dal fatto che il figlio di Bruno Conti, giocatore del Cagliari, ha rifilato un goal (di momentaneo vantaggio) proprio alla squadra di suo padre.  Anche se gli arbitri fossero sempre perfettamente in buona fede e privi di condizionamenti, e anche se avessero 10 moviole in campo, errori ce ne potrebbero essere sempre, perch sempre di esseri umani si tratta; credo che il problema non sia di fare in modo che ogni singola partita sia arbitrata in modo perfetto, bens in modo *imparziale*; per esempio, per me che sono tifoso della Roma, ci pu stare benissimo che oggi la mia squadra perde 2 punti per un errore arbitrale: se l'errore  non voluto, casuale, magari pi avanti sar "bilanciato" da un errore nel senso opposto; certo che, se a fine campionato il totale  "sbilanciato" di 10 e pi punti contro, non mi si pu venire a dire che la classifica finale non  stata falsata dagli arbitraggi, e il dubbio sull'imparzialit e buona fede della classe arbitrale mi viene.  Il problema per me  proprio questo: se a fine anno capitasse che una volta siamo stati danneggiati per 2-3 punti, un'altra favoriti in misura analoga, non recriminerei, e accetterei anche di perdere una posizione per un solo punto, anche laddove ritenessi che per errore la mia squadra fosse stata danneggiata per 2 punti: lo *dovrei* accettare ricordandomi che anche un arbitro imparziale pu sbagliare.  Purtroppo per accade troppo spesso che i "bilanci" in questione siano polarizzati pesantemente e sistematicamente nelle stesse direzioni, il che ci fa perdere fiducia nell'imparzialit degli arbitri, a tal punto che forse a volte vediamo la malafede pure dove magari c' solo stato un errore umano.    Tornando alla tua domanda: la giustizia sportiva  imperfetta come altre giustizie umane; il calcio non  mai stato e mai sar completamente pulito, perch gli uomini non sono perfetti e perch ci girano troppi soldi e troppi interessi anche extra-calcistici; quindi possiamo sperare che quest'anno le cose vadano meglio, ma non mi sbilancerei ad aspettarmi la perfezione.    Ciao e in bocca al lupo per il Cagliari.|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	ci sono troppi soldi in ballo, non sar mai pulito!|`|f631798672a19792f1ad9ee2991058a7aa	Chi ci crede ,pu anche credere a Ges bambino e alla Befana.|`|34feca8bb7714ba50de2afea1d397693aa	Il calcio ormai  solo uno spettacolo e come tale ha le regole del businnes.Deve andare avanti ma non  pi una cosa seria|`|0d9fcab71863c5e8d769ea34a8366bfdaa	NON SARA MAI PULITO IL CALCIO COME NON LO E' MAI STATO|`|0b937d7b2c70fc8d05cba30940df5198aa	Senza contare torti o favori per l'una o l'altra squadra, bisogna certamente fare molta chiarezza.  Bisogna innanzi tutto avere dirigenti federali che possano essere al di sopra delle parti, anche ex di grandi o piccole squadre, ma che ora non abbiano alcun rapporto con le societ (diretto si intende).  Da l dobbiamo pretendere arbitri professionisti, indipendenti da Lega e Federazione Italiana, magari con il CONI garante.  Solo dopo un accurato ripensamento cdi certe cose che fanno parte di questo calcio potremmo avere minori problemi, non certo la totale eliminazione.  Non ne farei un problema del Cagliari o di altre squadre, bisogna tutelare in egual modo tutte le societ, di conseguenza tutti i tifosi del calcio.  Al momento non si pu pensare: Moggi non c' tutto  ok, o "Juve serie B, allora tutto ok", ma fare un discorso che vada oltre.  Molte ancora sono quindi le cose da fare, un VERO presidente della Federazione, non pi un tecnico (che dura ormai da troppo tempo), bisong anacora lavorare molto per mettersi un pochino apposto.|`|fcdcf57ad9c9baf61787820420d186c2aa	no il calcio deve azzerare e riscrivere le regole...ci non  possibile in italia x cui t conviene guardare la champions league|`|6e9730ee827974989c04501eb637e7caaa	finche' girano milioni di euro o denaro in genere, non sara' mai niente pulito. l'importante e' fare mangiare tutti. se qualcuno non mangia fa lo spione. e si scoprono le magagne|`|9cf89b9f0cf7480da536f4697a2c05a1aa	il calcio italiano non sar mai pulito...dietro la pratica sportiva ci sono sempre interssi economici.|`|3c8ed653ab6bf75320680c76aec2db32aa	Secondo me la giustizia  una grande utopia.

Some prefer to be in the booth upstairs rather than on the sideline because they get easier access to replays on TV and some believe they have a better view of the action so that they can adjust their gameplan if they need to.

Los problemas del Madrid comenzaron en 2003 cuando despidieron injustamente al mejor entrenador que han tenido en los ltimos tiempos: Vicente Del Bosque. De ah en adelante todo el mundo ha sido testigo de lo que ha hecho el equipo. Este a?o, sin embargo, a pesar de que muchos dicen no estar de acuerdo con este equipo, pienso que el Madrid, de momento, no lo est haciendo tan mal, viene de tener buenos resultados tanto en Copa del Rey como en Champions. Lo que pasa es que los fichajes an no se han asentado y Capello es un hombre muy enrgico y disciplinado y an no consigue un once ideal. Pero creo que es muy temprano para hablar de crisis en el Madrid. El problema sigue estando en un buen entrenador para el equipo. No digo que Capello no lo sea, pero en mi opinin, no lo es para el Madrid. Saludos!!!|`|4f71be064b88ef74b4ed50358363425faa	pues no creo que el Real Madrid tenga problema alguno! es el mejor equipo de la liga!  bless|`|57034bcc7bfa269d3fa4c8be77818067aa	Lo inflado que est el mundo del ftbol y sus jugadores que por 90 min y 2 horas al da de entrenamiento cobran cantidades absurdas...

Arkansas if they don't go to the National Championship game will go to another BCS bowl.|`|AA11119479	The Razorbacks are doing quite well. Go Hogs!|`|839fc62f384c5a9300def95ce31a571caa	Nebraska showed they can play under pressure so they'll beat Texas- Arkansas is what it is I have no opinion there|`|8aa5f85b4dd536239b8ade249d0de719aa	THE HUSKERS|`|8b5cd7922dec6bb9dec7c806507c36c9aa	as a trojan who watched both teams go down to USC, i'm actually thrilled to see them do well because it helps USC's strength of schedule
be35eed86fb82d30248d81ac848bc312aa	A Cuahutemoc B. se le adora por muchas razones:  1) Esta en uno de los equipos ms populares de Mxico  2) Es la viva imagen de una persona de origen humilde que logr triunfar y la gente del populacho (que sonlos que lo idolatran ms) ven en el un heroe, admas de una muestra de que si se puede ser alguien en la vida (aunque la gente no haga nada para salir adelante).  3) Porque el Sr. Azcarraga Jean gasta miles de pesos en bombardear a todo el mundo con imagenes del America y de Cuahutemoc  a travs de la televisin, y como nosotros los mexicanos casi no le hacemos caso a la tele, pues...  4) Por que es un buen jugador de futbol.  5) Por que es una imagen de rebeldia y desmadre (golpear reporteros, hacer berrinches, etc. etc.) y la gente gusta lo que normalmente esta prohibido.  6) Porque aunque no es tan agraciado fisicamente anda con V.P.T. (viejas de prototipo televisivo).  7) Porque la gente se deja llevar siempre por algn idolo.

Yeah, didn't think so. Hate to say it, but the Lakers are stuck with Mihm until his contract is up, then they'll just let him walk|`|AA10859856	Yes, Chris always gets hurt.  But it seems like Bynum, and Kwame Brown is improving.  They are still no Star Class centers, but Kobe doesn't want a Star Center? (e.g. Shaq).   Maybe Lakders should opt for a consistant shooter who can knock down long Js and 3s.|`|bbcf6ef03600abb4cfb28377bf251f86aa	He's done for the season and his contract is expiring anyway

3cee6cd3562342775cb0fb37df5a5bdcaa	1 No es tu culpa haber peleado con una mujer, en todo caso del sabon de la chica y de la organizacin que lo permiti (aunque no veo mal el hacerlo), y de la chica que debe haber aceptado.    2 Tal como decan ms arriba, el mismo tipo de comportamiento que la llevo a la reaccin histerica de llorar, la hubiera llevado a la risa, y si estuviera en Yahoo Respuestas, ya estara preguntando "Saban que le gane a un hombre en un torneo de TKD?".    3 No creo en disminuir la valia de las mujeres, el sobreprotegerlas solo les confirma la imagen que la sociedad les impone, que es que ellas son ms debiles. Por mi parte, yo prefiero verlas como distintas, con otras caracteristicas a explotar. No comprendo las mujeres que exijen trato diferencial al momento de las exigencias, y lo mismo para las concesiones, si te sentis ms debil, entonces tenes que aceptar estar por debajo del resto. Aclaro y reafirmo, para toda esa gente que tiene lectura rapida y poco comprensiva, veo a las mujeres como pares con otras caracteristicas fisicas y psicologicas, no como inferiores, aunque ellas tengan esa imagen de ellas.-|`|506309291c193a606a058595c79e9bcaaa	Es lamentable lo sucedido, pero deberias tener la hombria de bien de pedir perdon, lo cortes no quita lo caballero.

Imaginate un boxeador profesional contra una mujer boxeador profesional...te apuesto lo que quieras que la chica no le aguanta mas de 3 rounds al cuate.
