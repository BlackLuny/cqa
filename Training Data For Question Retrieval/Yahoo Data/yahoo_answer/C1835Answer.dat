ZCsIG18yaa	Sem sombra de dúvidas o Avast.<br>  <br>  Bem conceituado e muito baixado na web, o Avast! Home Edition é um antivírus repleto de características que o tornam completo e equiparável aos antivírus pagos disponíveis no mercado. Se prevenir sempre foi o melhor remédio, este, sem dúvida, é uma op??o recomendada para proteger seu PC. Gratuito para uso pessoal e n?o-comercial, o antivírus tem atualiza??es automáticas via Internet e é muito fácil de operar.<br>  <br>  O que significa Avast?!<br>  <br>  Avast é uma gíria antiga relacionada aos piratas e que mais tarde foi incorporada à língua inglesa. "Avast" era um comando usado para parar rapidamente ou desistir. Um equivalente em português seria a interjei??o "alto". Já pela defini??o desse termo, você pode perceber como será a prote??o e “captura” das amea?as em seu computador.<br>  <br>  Interface arrojada<br>  <br>  A interface gráfica do antivírus é semelhante a um player de música(confira na imagem do programa). Isso porque a idéia dosdesenvolvedores é tornar o Avast fácil de usar, por isso foi criada umainterface que se assemelha a um aplicativo freqüentemente usado nodia-a-dia, como um player de áudio/vídeo.<br>  <br>  Por meio da interface gráfica principal, o usuário poderá atualizar seuantivírus, escanear o computador, verificar quarentena e visualizarhistóricos de análises e escaneamentos. Além disso, ele pode serconfigurado para trabalhar como protetor de tela.<br>  <br>  Mecanismo de seguran?a<br>  <br>  O mecanismo do Avast! é aprovado pelo laboratório da ICSA — empresa especializada em verificar softwares de seguran?a — certificando que este antivírus possui alta performance em suas habilidades de detec??o, especialmente para os perigosos cavalos-de-tróia.<br>  <br>  Dentre as características mais importantes, está incluído o suporte para escaneamento em arquivos compactados nos diversos formatos existentes, tais como: ACE, ARC, ARJ, BZIP2, CAB, CPIO, CHM, DPX, GZIP, ISO, LHA/LHX, MAPI, MIME, RAR, RPM, SIS, TAR, TNEF, ZIP, ZOO e 7-ZIP.<br>  <br>  Além de trabalhar com compacta??o, o Avast! também escaneia pacotes de executáveis, como ASPack, Diet, FSG, PeShield, PKLite, MEW, UPX, etc. Ele também é capaz de encontrar vírus que se escondem em arquivos de transmiss?es alternativas em parti??es NTFS. As demais pastas e arquivos de seu computador podem ser selecionadas e analisadas, sendo que o Avast! fará uma verifica??o apenas nela.<br>  <br>  Prote??o 24 por dia<br>  <br>  O Avast! Home Edition conta com prote??o em tempo real para manter o seu computador seguro 24 horas por dia, detectando amea?as antes que elas tenham chance de infectar o sistema. Essa prote??o aplica-se aos arquivos de sistema e também aos leitores de e-mails ou notícias.<br>  <br>  Ela inicializa-se juntamente ao sistema operacional e oferece personaliza??o de op??es para você especificar arquivos que ser?o escaneados e os tipos de extens?es. Sua prote??o para com os leitores de notícias e e-mails consiste em dois modos: protocolo ou plugin.<br>  <br>  No primeiro ele trabalhará diretamente com as contas de e-mail IMAP4, POP3, NNTP e SMTP; já no segundo, fornece um plugin especial apenas para o cliente de e-mail Microsoft Outlook, providenciando uma varredura mais transparente e completa.<br>  <br>  Uma característica inovadora é a capacidade de análise heurística ao escanear e-mails, permitindo dessa forma, detectar vírus e worms que n?o s?o possíveis de descobrir através de detec??es triviais. A performance da análise heurística é excelente, avaliando cada mensagem e verificando assinaturas suspeitas que anunciam possíveis amea?as.<br>  <br>  Características gerais<br>  <br>      * Mantêm seus compartilhadores de arquivos e mensageiros instantaneos protegidos: o Avast é capaz de criar um escudo protetor para mensageiros instantaneos e compartilhadores P2P (Shareaza, Limewire, eMule, Ares Galaxy, etc.), protegendo o usuário de arquivos perigosos. Além disso, suas conversas no Windows Live Messenger podem receber uma seguran?a extra, já que qualquer transmiss?o de arquivo suspeito é alertada.<br>      * Prote??o e defesa para sua rede: o antivírus fornece uma prote??o de rede capaz de fornecer defesa para ataques de hackers e worms. Ele analisa todo o tráfego de rede em busca de conteúdos maliciosos, assemelhando-se muito a uma ferramenta chamada firewall.<br>      * Navegue com mais prazer: o Avast possibilita uma navega??o mais segura e agradável, filtrando e monitorado o tráfego de endere?os HTTP de websites na Internet. Ele age como um proxy de HTTP transparente com compatibilidade para os navegadores mais conhecidos, como: Internet Explorer, Firefox e Opera.|`|HNwdM44Waa	cara ja usei os dois e n?o gostei e tem o norton também mais eu gostei mesmo foi do avira muito bom p/ reconhecer virús e p/ remover esses dois  em alguma coisa eles falham.|`|4ca93272fe42ba0f2bb0df8edf7bbe50aa	nenhum dos dois <br>  Avira é o melhor!|`|gcs1Ycjmaa	para atualizar o avast eu uso, ele faz isso quase todos os dias!|`|Y9faomxKaa	AVAST!<br>  Certeza de atualiza??o; n?o tive problemas.|`|tCzPWEEYaa	Eu prefiro o Avg|`|76Ldg3C9aa	ávira!!!   em baixe esses... avira free é o melhor!!!!|`|BegbPZQYaa	Olha,eu falei  com um tecnico de imformatica,ele falou q o avast n?o presta,se vc tiver um avast no seu pc,desinstale imeiatamente,o  avast alem de n?o pegar virus,ele ainda tras virus pro seu pc!

First, find the music that you want to add to your movie and import it into your project. Second, add the music to the timeline on the Audio/Music track and edit it to create just the effect that you want.<br>  <br>  Click File, and then click Import Media Items.<br>  <br>  Browse to the file that you want to add, and then click the file. You can import audio files with the following file name extensions into Windows Movie Maker: .aif, .aifc, .aiff .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma.<br>  <br>  Click Import.<br>  <br>  Drag the music file to the Audio/Music track of the timeline. <br>  <br>  Use the preview monitor to preview the accompanying video, and then drag the audio track to the right or left to better synchronize the audio and video, if needed. The pointer turns into a hand when you click the audio file, indicating that you can move it.<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  A quick way to adjust the volume of an audio clip on the Audio/Music track is to right-click the clip, and then click Volume. Adjust the volume with the slider.<br>  <br>  You can add both music and narration to the Audio/Music track in Windows Movie Maker. Both can play at the same time in your published movie. You can then adjust the audio levels to determine which audio will play louder than the other in your movie.|`|RQwFq0Fwaa	click import audio tab....use the drag method to position the audio where you want it...use the split tab to delete parts off the audio...set a volume level on the audio by right clicking it in the time line > volume|`|9mnZ9U7Xaa	1.)

The chances of getting caught are relatively small and you'll get people saying "I've been stealing software for years with no problem", or give you pirate download sites, but then again these thieves ae not the ones going to get prosecuted if you and your friend get caught.<br>  <br>  Use the add / remove progams applet in Control Panel to remove the program. This usually makes a good job of removing the program, but look in your Start menu to make sure all the shortcuts are gone. Also look in the Program Files and Users > App Data (this is a hidden directory) and make sure no folders or files are left behind.<br>  <br>  Rather than edit the registry yourself use something like ccleaner - <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a> - to find entries that were associated with DreamWeaver and delete them.

They're very easy to install. You will notice probably a total of 6 little black circles located around your screen. Just take a knife and pop those out. Therefor revealing the screws. After you have those undone all that's left to do is disconnect the ribbon running from your video card to your screen. Replace it with the one that you receive and you should be good to go. More than likely the new screen you receive will be better and more bright. Just type in your computer make and model number followed by the word "screen" and you should begin to find some results.

Such as a short. Or it could be software related. Depending on how long you've had the computer I'd check and see if it's still under warranty.

AA10221696	Excellent and very important question! You are smart to ask this.<br>  <br>  Yes, yes, yes. Nothing is private on the web, on the phone, or on your cell phone. Your computers hard drive can even be read remotely through remote activation and Wii-Fii wireless connections. Be very careful. Its always good to have one computer that never connects to the internet in the house. And has no bluetooth devices.<br>  <br>  Remember that like anytime you swipe a credit card, information is being stored on you. Remember that anything you write online, can be retrieved later. They do it all the time for criminal investigations. The us govt has admitted that they listen in on calls without people's permissions all the time from the middle east, calling the US.<br>  <br>  Remember that there is spyware that can be remotely activated by another computer, in attachments in an im etc. to not only turn on the camera that is attached to your computer and record you without knowing but also collect all information as to where you are going on the web, what emails you write or what you type. -read about spyware.<br>  <br>  And for those people who haven't started out in life. It used to be that a paper resume could get you the job. But now employers are not only looking at resumes, they will google you as well. Beware of where you posted, what you said, even if it was for fun. Google your name often, google your email address, your phone number and see what others might see about you. Before you go for that job interview. <br>  <br>  If you have some embarrassing or terrible things that you are not happy about, you may have to contact a lawyer or the site administrator, and ask that they remove the information. But remember it can always be retrieved later. better to use discretion and caution in anything you do on any electronic device you have. Good luck, you seem smart.|`|VwGfMv0paa	Yes, it is.

Windows 7 is great but I have seen a few offices (the type where you sit down at somebody's desk for some sort of interview) still using Windows 2000|`|U7d3Ft9baa	Windows XP is a good program and works very well so I will change it to Windows 7 later when all updates are on.|`|sYxUVBvPaa	well first of all for 90% of the population vista works fine. Personally I love it and i do all sorts of things with mine. Second of all, WIndows 7 is what Vista should been in the first place. IT has minor changes to the UI but it is really just vista with an excellent makeover. Im guessing your question was meant to be a joke as in you will not use windows 7 if it is like vista but trust me, its much better. I'm using the beta now and even at this stage it is working excellent. The biggest improvement is that it reduces the heavy footprints other windows versions have had so now it is much faster in general and both starts up and shuts down quickly. Also, all the worthless programs that it normally comes with are available from the Microsoft website for free but are not included in the package so its a lighter overall OS. To give you an idea, the minimum requirements for the system are like 1 gig of ram and a 1.0GHZ processor so many people will be getting this upgrade.<br>  <br>  FURTHERMORE, XP will NOT be around for a long time. It has already been officially phased out (is no longer in production) and support for it continues through 2011 but will not be supported at all after that. So it will be here til' '11 but its not where they are directing their attention moving forward...all new software and computer product is geared towards vista and windows 7 (vista fresca)|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Seems like forever. Actually i'm using Vista and boy do I hate it. I was hoping 7 would be my savior. We'll see when it goes live. If it has better hardware/software compatibility then Vista it won't be that bad. That's my main problem with vista. It didn't even recognize my printer, let alone the other more complicated things I do  with it. It didnt recognize my laptops webcam either. I had to install and set up a different driver. Ugh, i'm in computer science and I'm dreading doing anything more complicated then running eclipse. It's just such a crappy windows.|`|EamhENYJaa	I am not sure why you are still using XP as all the new drivers are being written for Vista. By that logic, Vista is based on XP which is based on Window 2000 which is based on Windows 98 ........<br>  In any case, Windows 7 will have the problems of Vista fixed.|`|1thElV58aa	its not like were going to update are computer when something new comes out, your work or school will probably change over.

sYxUVBvPaa	yes you can make your own recovery disks in vista or go to best buy and have it done for $40 but you can not download it. Your windows key is built into your motherboard and will be loaded with the dvds when  you burn them. This is why you can not just use any copy of windows because the keys will not match up and you will be required to enter one. If you look at the bottom of your laptop or the back of your desktop you should find a vista sticker with your key license on it. That is your vista product key. The only computers shipping with the DVDs in the box right now are Dells so its no mistake.<br>  <br>  i would guide you through it but unfortunately those disks can only be made ONCE...EVER so mine were made for me by dell and i do not have the option to do it on my laptop so i can't guide you to the location to do this. If you are not very comfortable with this idea then like stated above i would have Best Buy do it so its done right and then just make sure to never throw them away.|`|M4AauVmDaa	you have to try utorrent to find out vista but it's not a original copy of vista ....ok..may be it help u ???|`|8d7ac16347d32d9fa03837f21bb72527aa	some computer brands have a function to where you can press f8 at the boot screen and it will give you the option to restore the system to it's "out of box" stage which means it'll restore itself to the state when you purchased it. i know some dell laptops have that function. <br>  <br>  downloading legally is not possible. i would go to whoever you bought the computer from and ask them about this, they should be able to help you or give you contact details to where you can find out.|`|URrIt6hOaa	NO It is illegal<br>  Torrents are illegal

zjzOPoMSaa	Running it on direct power will not harm any components, you might want to tape the magsafe on though. You will find that it very easily can come off when the computer is moved, and without battery, it'll shut down. The old macbook pro's do not have a lithium-ion battery as the above posts state, they have a lithium polymer battery. I have an old macbook pro and I can tell you from experience, you will notice a significant drop in battery runtime after about 4 months. This type of battery benefits from cycling (Fully discharge then fully recharge once a month). You should also download a program called coconut battery (<a href="http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery)." rel="nofollow">http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutba...</a> You can use this program to compare the battery strength over time. You have a very good idea removing the battery, just make sure that plug doesn't pop off when the computer is running, and make sure to cycle once a month.|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	It is perfectly safe, except for the increased risk of damage from power surges.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you keep the battery fully charged and in a cool dry place when you are not using it.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Well, the fundamental idea that the battery will last longer if you don't use it is flawed.  Lithium Ion batteries don't have any kind of memory nor do they care how many times they are recharged.  The only factor that affects the life of a Lithium Ion battery is time.  The battery will wear out over time regardless of whether you use it or not, so you might as well use it.|`|cViFUALzaa	Li On batteries, which your mac has, do not last longer if you do not use them. LiOn batteries begin to deteriorate the moment they are manufactured, a quality Li-On battery will last about 3 years, whether you use it or not. <br>  <br>  Now that you know this, my advice is to attach the battery and use mains power whenever possible, just so the battery will help absorb any surges or drops in power.|`|VbP8YWonaa	I run all my laptops with the ac adapter and leave the batteries connected. The ac adapter acts like a trickle charger, keeps my battery charged and if the ac power goes off my battery takes over allowing me to save what I am doing and shut down my system. Removing the battery isn't really saving anything battery wise.|`|830975bdddce0089e9ee3292220e495baa	I have macbook pro and macbook Air and run them on electricity all the time. Never on battery. I have had them for over a year now and have no problems. The processor does not run slow, it does not heat up because of overcharging... everything is absolutely normal. So don't worry!

These types of applications can allow you you quickly and effectively eliminate your history settings as well as various other caches.

MrnLdm9Uaa	There are plenty of technical resources on the Web that discuss cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs). Most times you won't need to worry about this technobabble. That is, until one it day it suddenly appears and you think - what the hell does that mean? In simple terms, a CRC is bit of mathematics used to ensure that your data is OK when being transfered. It's a checking procedure that quickly identifies when data has been damaged. If you get this message, it means that the file being read by your PC or software is corrupted. However, it does not mean all the data is lost forever. When data is transfered, it is usually in small blocks and each block is given a CRC value. If something goes wrong with the data between the time it leaves the source and arrives at its destination, the CRC sent at the source will no longer match the one that is calculated when the data arrives - this is when the cyclic redundancy check error will appear.<br>  The most common time you will see the cyclic redundancy check error message is when trying to read data from a damaged CD or DVD. Just before it appears, your CD/DVD drive will probably grind and whirl away - your PC may also become a little slugglish.<br>  <br>  Less frequent causes are the result of system crashes, and buggy software (hello Microsoft), incomplete downloads (often identified by the misleading message 'This is not a valid Windows file', 'This is not a valid win32 application' or 'Corrupt Zip file'). If this problem happens frequently with downloads, try using a download manager.<br>  <br>  For CDs and DVDs, the problem is a little different. Normally, when CD/DVD drives get a CRC message from a disc, they try to read the disc again - hence the grinding sound. After several failed attempts, they give up and display the redundancy check error. The problem can be hardware (loose cables, failing drive), software or damaged media. In most cases checking and cleaning the disc is the easiest way to overcome the problem. If different clean discs produce the same error, it is likely to be a hardware issue (check the discs in another drive). Another common cause of these errors is poorly burnt CDs and DVDs - especially those that had numerous or severe buffer underuns. USB burners suffer from this problem when the burn speed is too high (generally above 4X-8X)<br>  <br>  If the discs are damaged, you'll probably need a recovery tool to get back your data. CDCheck 3 will work for CDs and DVDs. First it will check the media, and then you have the option to recover the files. It's free for personal use and has saved many people heartache when it comes to recovering lost digital images and videos from damaged CDs.|`|rMSJ6Gqcaa	You need to use a little ALCOHOL<br>  a little of ALCOHOL 100% <br>  Google it & Download it|`|HNLcHb65aa	CRC( Cyclic Redundancy Check) is error correction mechanism, most probably what you are trying to copy may be corrupted data and the correction mechanism is not able to correct it even after several passes so it displays CRC Error.

lb0bYSgUaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

RKZyCuESaa	First of all, if you have more than one antivirus, you'll cause conflicts with the scans; Same thing with antispywares.<br>  <br>  For antiviruses, I'd recommend you to buy one of the following:<br>  1. Trend Micro<br>  2. Panda<br>  3. BitDefender<br>  4. Kaspersky<br>  5. NOD32<br>  <br>  If you don't want to buy one, you could always use AVG Free.<br>  <br>  For anti-spywares, you could buy:<br>  1. Spyware Doctor<br>  2. Trend Micro<br>  3. SuperAntiSpyware<br>  <br>  Or simply download one of the following:<br>  - Lavsoft Ad-Aware<br>  - Spybot Search & Destroy<br>  <br>  If you want some extra protection, you can download Threatfire...<br>  <a href="http://www.threatfire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.threatfire.com/</a><br>  ...Which scans softwares that behave like viruses and your anti-virus might not be able to detect.<br>  <br>  And/or download an Anti-Malware like Malwarebytes.<br>  <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" rel="nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br>  <br>  You may download and scan with all of them at the same time, but I'd scan with one at a time because scans may cause conflicts with eachother and they'll take longer to scan if you're doing other things in your computer.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	I have used AVG Anti Virus, Zone Alarm Firewall,  I have recently added superantispyware and Malwarebytes. They are all free for personal use and I have had no trouble with Viruses Trojans Hackers etc. I have just upgraded to AVG free 8.0 and all seems good so far. Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.download.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/</a> I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site. It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly.

In other words you have several programs (Spyware/antivirus)because you have a virus.  You need to save all valuable programs, pics, music, etc on an external hard drive and RUN your recovery disc and clear up all spyware/viruses.  Then use one reliable program that will guard your computer from future spyware/viruses.  I hope others will answer and give you a name of a reliable spy/virus program instead of having several.  Good luck.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	ok, it might not be smart to have a few antivirus or antispyware in your pc. it might make your system go haywire, even if you try to run them separately|`|l8TGolvVaa	what do you mean by everything?|`|NNp7bhPraa	You definately want to run them separately. It's also good to start the computer up in safe mode and then run the scans. Be careful how many anti-virus programs you put on your computer though. if you have too many of them that have a feature that constantly scans/protects your computer it can cause a conflict and give you the blue screen. Don't know tons about computers, but that should help.

C is a structure based language while OOP is found in programming languages like Java. OOP is based on things called objects while in C progamming can only be done according to the 3 control structures(sequence, selection, repetition ... remeber?).

938bbc1eb2da08dbda8df1f1a8d2730baa	Folder Lock is a fast file-security program that can password-protect, lock, hide and encrypt any number of files, folders, drives, pictures and documents in seconds. Protected files are hidden, undeletable, inaccessible and highly secure. It hides files from kids, friends and co-workers, safeguards them from viruses, trojans, worms and spyware, and even protects them from networked PCs, cable users and hackers. Files can also be protected on USB Flash Drives, Memory Sticks, CD-RW, floppies and notebooks. Protection works even if files are taken from one PC to another on a removable disk, without the need to install any software. It locks files in Windows, DOS and even Safe Modes. Additional Options include Stealth Mode, Hacker Attempt Monitoring, Shred files, AutoLock, Auto Shutdown PC, Lock your PC, Erase PC tracks, 256-bit Blowfish Encryption and Context Menu in Explorer. Works on Windows 2003/XP/2000/NT/Me/98 and all kinds of disk types like FAT16, FAT32, NTFS.

However, since you are using the compression feature of XP I'll try to summarize.<br>  <br>  For the sake of simplicity lets say that you want to create the folder on your desktop.<br>  <br>  1. Right click on an empty space on the desktop. This will bring up a sub-menu with several options. You'll want to move your mouse pointer down to the option that says "new"<br>  <br>  2. Once the mouse pointer is on new, another sub menu will appear. You will want to go the the entry that reads "Compressed (zipped) Folder and left click on it. This will create a new folder on your desktop that is named "New Compressed (zipped) folder.<br>  <br>  3. Left click twice on the newly created folder. This will bring up the window to see the folders contents. <br>  <br>  4, Once this window is open add the file that you wish to protect to the folder (drag and drop) and make sure that you use the right mouse button to drag the items into the new compressed folder. otherwise only copies will be added to the compressed folders and the originals will still be where you left them.<br>  <br>  5. Once you have added all of the files that you wish to protect to the folder look toward the top of the window and you will see menu headings that read: File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools and Help.<br>  <br>  6. Left click on the menu heading that reads "File." This will present a small sub menu.<br>  <br>  7. Left click on the entry that reads "Add a Password." This will bring up the "Add Password" window. <br>  <br>  8. Enter the password that you want to use in the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields and click OK.<br>  <br>  9. Once the process is completed double click on one of the files that you choose to protect. This should bring up a window that asks for your password. <br>  <br>  10.

366aaa4c0e404e9ee2e6cb74124dcb48aa	My first question for you is why do you feel that you need to clean the registry?  This is typically an area of the operating system that should not be tampered with.  However, over time a registry can get muddled with bad references and objects that are unlinked or mis-linked.  This occurs if you do a lot of installing and uninstalling of applications.  Software that is not well written often does a poor job of removing its references from the registry.  It is reccomneded that you reboot after uninstalling an application as some data get marked for deletion following teh reboot.  Items that are read into memory are locked by the OS and cannot be deleted until after the reboot.  There are many, many tools that claim to do the job, but often they leave messes as big or bigger than what may already exist.  If you feel you must, then use a Microsoft product for such operating systems.  Microsoft RegClean.  Personally, when things start to get funky I back up my files and do a nice clean reinstallation of Windows.  You will be surprised how much smoother the PC runs when you start fresh  ;)|`|AA10625534	check here www.ccleaner.com|`|fb735ba79376725108c611b12d935f0faa	I would recommend using StompSoft's Registry Repair to handle the cleaning of your registry as it has a clean and friendly interface and it is not too aggressive in its cleaning process.|`|1ac340ad180cd3aee2ab563d84a933fbaa	i dont condone the use of registry cleaners as they tend to work too well|`|210e8e3f8408bc894b20391c7671e912aa	Reg supreme.

Also you need to care about the Memory, better to have it not less than 512 MB, and the VGA Card to be 128 MB.<br>  <br>  I personally recommend in this case buying Toshiba brand as it has a very good option which is the VGA card shares its memory with the main memory of the computer that means when the program you are running needs more memory than the one found in your VGA card it will automatically consume from the main memory of the computer and not from the Hard Drive as usual.|`|1e8849c7b7099295519d5859f560e4f7aa	Definitely a Sony Vaio.

Look for "Editing Options" and UNcheck "Use CSS instead of HTML tags".<br>  <br>  However, a better use of your time is to learn how to use CSS, and create styles for the effects you want. I recommend not using the properties bar at all to set font face, color or size. Asking Dreamweaver to put in all those span tags in your code is no better than putting in a bunch of font tags.  What you're after is controlling the look and feel from one central place instead of dozens or thousands of individual places!<br>  <br>  Try playing around with the icons in the CSS Styles tab until you figure out what they do.

Instead, they use "trackers" that are like a central storage of filename, hash, and the IP and port numbers of everyone sharing and downloading the torrent. Because of this, yet, they can identify your IP and other IPs that are downloading a specific torrent. Trackers are illegal to set up in many countries, mainly the US, so that is why a lot of them are based out of other countries. Sites like PirateBay and Mininova search trackers all over the web for the files you search for, but even these sites would be illegal in the US, though I think some lawsuits are still pending on that.<br>  <br>  The only country that I know of where you are 100% safe downloading and uploading torrents is Sweden, but many other countries, like Japan and China have no incentive to police their citizens over requests from the US-based MPAA and RIAA, which are the two organizations that actively sue individuals.|`|AA10780746	The straight answer? Yes, you could get caught. But there are precautions you can take to help lower the chances of that significantly. First, pick your sources carefully. Public sites such as mininova may have a nice large collection, but anyone can post to them, including Law Enforcement and Studios looking to bust people. If you can, try to get into a place that screens its users.<br>  <br>  Second, read the comments posted on the torrents. This is a great way to find out not only if a file may be just a target, but also whether or not other users have found virus's or other problems.<br>  <br>  Third, know your distributor. There are alot of people out there that release good, high quality files, and have their own way to prove the file is legit (as far as that term can be applied to illegal downloading anyway).<br>  <br>  In general, dont just click on the first file you see. Take some time to research the file, the source, and the site. It can help ALOT. The big thing to watch for is a warning email from your ISP. ISP's such as comcast, at&t, etc, are actually fighting FOR you instead of AGAINST you. Many times, if they get a report of your downloads, they actually will warn you about it. If this happens, stay away from the sources you've been getting files from for a month or so.

If it does then you might have the old version of McAfee which has been having a few problems recently. If it is a red background with a White M on the icon, that also indicates old version. The new version has a White background and a red M. Also, have you tried running a scan recently? Run a virus scan if you haven't, you might have a virus that's disabling it. Also, make sure you don't have spyware- try Spybot Search and Destroy, or Ad-Aware SE- they are compatible with McAfee. If you have any other anti-virus software installed such as Norton or Kaspersky, then you would need to uninstall them... even though you may have them disabled if they are installed, the updates still try to take place and will disable any other anti-virus softwares.

If this is the case:<br>  <br>  If you are connecting using a USB connection:<br>  Try a different USB port on your computer. If that doesn't help, then reinstall the USB drivers from your modem or CHSI install cd.<br>  <br>  If you are connecting using Ethernet:<br>  First, reset the modem (unplug electric and replug) and then try using the Ethernet cable that connects the OTHER computer (the one that is working) to see if the problem is simply the Ethernet cable. If you still have no connection go to the next step.<br>  <br>  Second, IF this is Windows XP OS, then try reinstalling the NIC. Go to Start>Control Panel>System>Hardware>Device Manager>scroll down list till you see Network Adapters and click + beside it. Find your Network Card in the list and right click on it, and choose Uninstall. Confirm Uninstall. Close windows and restart computer. It will reinstall on startup. Reset modem again.<br>  If you still get "Limited or No Connectivity" get computer mfg support or Microsoft to walk you through reinstalling this NIC using the Windows XP cd. This will ensure all the drivers are reinstalled in case they have become corrupted.<br>  <br>  *Important Note* If this NIC was installed AFTER you purchased the computer then you have a software cd that you will need to reinstall the NIC after uninstalling. ALSO, if you have any other OS besides XP this method will not work automatically and you will need the Windows XP cd to reinstall. <br>  <br>  If you are connecting two computers at the same time using a router, then there is always the possibility of a bad port on the router, try a different port; most have about 4 to choose from.<br>  <br>  If you are NOT connecting both computers at once and only connect one at a time, it is IMPERATIVE that you reset the modem between connections. Residential service typically only provides one IP address and if this is true in this situation, your modem assigns an IP address to a specific MAC address inside your computer. When you d/c the Ethernet or USB connection from one computer and try to connect the other one, you MUST reset the modem (unplug elec and replug) to clear the memory so that the IP address can be assigned to a different MAC in your second computer.<br>  <br>  The issue does sound hardware related but you cannot rule out virus activity as a possibility 100% until you try the other options and then have it checked by a computer pro. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|R8rG3CSYaa	you should just be able to restart the computer, you are probably having a DHCP problem|`|WN3iCEAQaa	You should get qwest dsl it's really fast.<br>  thats what i have and i have no problme

If you want to take things one step further and share files between PCs, just set the file sharing up on them. You will then see a sharing tab when you right click any folders or hard drives.

Put the total # of yes in column B, and then total # of no's in column C.  After you have entered all of your data, click on the graph button at the top of your page.  Use chart type (column), chart sub-type (clustered column), then click next.  Then use your mouse to select the data range, make sure you include everything in column a, b, and c, and then click next.  Under chart title, give your graph a name.  Under category x axis, label it "grade level".  Under category y axis, label it "# of yes/no answers".   Then click next, then click finish.  I hope this helps.

Many downloads using P2P file-sharing programs are loaded with malware<br>  <br>  LIMEWIRE IS NOT A WEBSITE.<br>  <br>  You will be downloading "stuff" from unknown stranger's computers while they will be uploading from your computer at the same time. You do not download from any website.<br>  <br>  It is amazing that people who would never accept and eat a sandwich from a stranger, don't think twice about downloading a file to their PC from a perfect stranger, who lives half-way around the World!<br>  <br>  If you don't know the difference between a .wmp (good) file from a .wmf (potentially very bad) file or a .zip from a .pif, then stay away from Limewire, Kazaa, and all P2P programs. The same is true if you don't know the difference between a song that is 25kb in size from one that is 3 mb in size.

Like, usually songs are around 2mb or so. 1mb, also... but if it's like 60kb or something like that, it's a virus.<br>  <br>  Also, look at the filetypes. If it's .wma, it could have a virus attached, but that's still uncommon.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	LimeWire needs to override some of your settings in order for it to let unknown files into your computer (which is what downloading essentially is).<br>  Just as a general rule, downloading things is never 100% safe. But if you really want to run LimeWire, I would just steer clear of opening files that end in ".exe" - songs and videos should be fine, but beware that some of the more advanced virus-makers can embed trojans and other such nasty things into mp3s as well.

It won't delete because it's embedded into another program....probably. <br>  <br>  Go to your Add/Remove and take out the shareware you probably have downloaded at some time in the past.|`|AA11877011	go to control panel, click on add remove programs, find this software, and delete it.  Then, restart the PC.  If it is not gone, type the name of the file after you right click on my computer icon and choose search.  Delete the files that the search engine finds with the weather bar.  If that doesn't work, I guess you have to rebuild the Windows program you are using.  With the latest versions of Windows I believe you can reset the Windows program to go back to the previous settings.  Of course when you rebuild the Windows, you have to save all information because it will start from the beginning, meaning you will have the programs you had when you first purchased the PC, nothing you have added after the time you purchased it.  another thing you should consider is, remember when did this weather bug became apparent?  I mean, what software did you download? You may have to remove that software because maybe it came in a package.  So, if you really want the other software, you have to keep it.  Otherwise, buy that software separately.<br>  Hope this helps.

You can choose the Safe Mode with Networking option, which loads all of the above files and drivers and the essential services and drivers to start networking, or you can choose the Safe Mode with Command Prompt option, which is exactly the same as safe mode except that a command prompt is started instead of the graphical user interface. You can also choose Last Known Good Configuration, which starts your computer using the registry information that was saved at the last shutdown. <br>  Safe mode helps you diagnose problems. If a symptom does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and minimum device drivers as possible causes.

And even if it manages to connect to some of the seeds, it won't ever connect to all 1006 of them (not in my experience, anyway). Your best bet will be a little bit of patience.

zvQ1lfuXaa	Since you are using a wireless connection. And your experience an intermittent connection. One possible cause of this is EMI (electro magnetic interference). Check for possible interference coming from microwave, cordless phone, speaker, tv set. and any other electronic device that uses radio frequency. The router should not be near to any of those. It is normal for the wireless light to occasionally blinks. What's important are the light on power, ethernet and broadband or dsl, those 3 light should be solid green. If the ones that is blinkling is Broadband or DSL, then it might be with filter or line issues. Now going back to wireless, you may also check the wireless settings of your network. Just go to <a href="http://gateway.2wire.net" rel="nofollow">http://gateway.2wire.net</a> or 192.168.1.254 or 172.16.0.1, depends on what type of modem and firmware you have. Click on Home Network, Go to Wireless Settings and there you can change the channel of your wireless network. Don't put it on channel 6 because microwave and cordless phone are running on that frequency level. You may put it on channel 10. And you may also increase the power settings up to 10.<br>  <br>  So, thats it. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ac27bed489db4e759eec9451e290d5eeaa	<a href="http://www.2wire.com/?p=72" rel="nofollow">http://www.2wire.com/?p=72</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://gateway.2wire.net/" rel="nofollow">http://gateway.2wire.net/</a><br>  <br>  check out these two places and if you cant find the problem call your dsl provider|`|alH9Tlahaa	Sometimes with wireless router and the modem you have to marry them before they will work good.

wbzAkLCLaa	First, you didn't list WHICH cards are actually in the computer-<br>  just because you listed nvidia and ati doesn't mean a thing... some of each of the competitors cards are competitors.<br>  <br>  You'd probably be fine with the Studio though-<br>  because you aren't doing any major gaming.<br>  <br>  Second, you're paying for Vista when you buy the machine... don't downgrade. That's silly. Besides, things are going Vista, forward from now... so why would you set yourself back?... You're going to have to learn the aesthetics and get used to it sooner or later, right?<br>  <br>  Aside from that, Vista CS4 and the others mentioned run smoother and better than XP versions...<br>  <br>  Any case, let me know if you have any questions.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	I have to agree with Brice on the Vista point. You're paying for Vista, so use it. Plus, Windows is no longer supporting XP at all, so you need to stick with Vista.<br>  <br>  Ideally, a Mac is best for graphics. They just have PCs beat when it comes to display and graphics cards, and I would highly recommend them. They have good tech support if you need help, and are very easy to use. They're a little on the more expensive side, but you're paying for hardware that's going to last much longer anyway, so it's worth it.<br>  <br>  Basically, I recommend a Mac instead of sweating over which graphics card to ally yourself with.

cbbjaWdAaa	El problema viene quizas al resetear el BIOS. <br>  <br>  Hay varios sistemas de encendido automático (Boot on): al recibir información por la red, al recibir información de un modem, por alarma del reloj interno de pc, por teclado, por raton, etc. Aunque no todas las BIOS permiten de todo.<br>  <br>  Prueba a desconectar cables de red, modems, etc de tu sistema y ver si así se vuelve a encender. Si al hacer esto no se vuelve a encender solo, será cuestión de entrar en el SETUP y deshabilitar todos los "BootOn".<br>  <br>  Si tras hacer eso siguen los problemas, probablemente se puenteen los pines del interruptor de encendido. ?Tocaste algo más de la placa al sustituir la fuente?<br>  <br>  Probablemente sea la primera opción.<br>  <br>  Un saludo!|`|R2OpxVjWaa	Yo creo que tu PC se prende sola devido a los ESPIRITUS CHOCARREROS tienes que hacerle un exorcismo.|`|45181ee4de92e40d7fa0d04caee0295eaa	Revisa en el BIOS para ver si tiene la función de encendido automático y deshabilitala, la otra es que estén mal conectados o invertidos los cables de los leds y el botón de encendido que van del chasis a la mother board, checa que estén conectados correctamente, si es así invierte la posición muchas veces con esto se corrige, puede ser también que la fuente no sea compatible con tu motherboard.<br>  <br>  Saludos.
dGB1UnJpaa	sin duda es el procesador, te explico, si fuera la tarjeta de video, solo no te dejaria ver nada en la pantalla, el boton de encendido cambiaria de color de verde a naranja, si fuese el disco duro, en tonces cuando lo propbaras en optro equipo te marcaria que como  tiene sectores da?ados no puedes tener lectura de este o simplemento no reconoce el disco, <br>  lo mas apropiado es que sea el procesador, puede que este recalentado, o flojo, si se recalienta el procesador,mejor cambialo por otro, pero si esta flojo colocale pastra conductora entre el procesador y la placa sabe para que quede bien fija y no se mueba, si es que esta floja el area del procesador y le colocas la pasta esta ya no tendra algun problema ya no se apagara,|`|H2BKEjlKaa	tienes virus<br>  <br>  uno de tus discos de instalacion esta infectado, te recomiendo consigas otros o una version menos, (win98),<br>  <br>  suerte...|`|Kjq5lV6jaa	95 % seguro es la fuente probablemente esta vieja y/o no manda la enegria necesaria la cambias y ya saldra unos $100  que la pongan pero si sabes un poquito la compras y la pones vos la fuentes es el cuadrado con un ventilador que esta en la parte superior trasera de la cpu. <br>  es facil cambiarla pero si no estas seguro mejor gastar unso pesos ams  yque la ponga alguien que parece que sabe :P|`|NaJ6dsjTaa	Hay varias respuestas para tu problema.<br>  El disco de instalacion puede estar da?ado, el procesador se calienta y por eso se bloquea o tienes floja una memoria RAM.<br>  <br>  Lo que puedes hacer es entrar al Bios y Revisar si todos los componentes de Software estan bien instalados.<br>  <br>  bye<br>  ._|.<(+_+)>.|_.>|`|TTgMQmHdaa	mira puede ser  varios motivos para lo que te esta pasando ya te dieron algunos tips que pueden ser , a mi me paso lo mismo  solo  que  despues de mucho batallar  lo que me estaba afectando fueron los cables ide que ta estaban bien viejitos te recomiendo que los cheques y  otra puede ser la fuente de poder que ya no este mandando suficiente energia  y cuando el cd room empieza a trabajar y forzarze  simplemente  lo bota ya que no hay la suf capacidad para que trabaje al 100% y otra puede ser el procesador que se este calentando  y igual bota todo y tienes que ir descartando posibilidades  !!!  y que todo este bien conectado y hechale un ojo al bios  que todo este dado de alta .ok bueno suerte   espero y soluciones tu problema|`|fTl0A0UFaa	Por lo que me cuentas yo creo que el procesador se esta sobrecalentando por eso se apaga, deberias revisar el ventilador del mismo tal vez ya no funciona.|`|R2OpxVjWaa	Yo tuve el mismo problema por 3 meses, la PC se apagaba sola y aveces se hacia reset pero antes me ponia una pantalla azul indicandome que un driver mandaba error pense que podria tratarse de un virus pero al final una de  las memorias dejo de funcionar cambie las 2 tarjetas de memoria y problema resuelto aproveche para cambiar la fuente de poder y actualizar el sistema operativo a windows vista y el sistema funciona como nuevo otra vez. Espero que esto te sirva para resolver tu problema.
chuNwSTtaa	First, try searching something common such as "boobs". This will test if your connected to limewires network. If nothing comes up in search results from boobs or porno searches, then you may not be connected to the network. So if this is the case, then open limewire, look at the top left and click file, and then click connect, but if connect is shaded, then click disconnect, click file again, and click connect, and wait about 10 seconds and then try searching for songs again.|`|35826c14de40ddf7f6073b89f429ac04aa	sounds like a firewall issue. Look at the bottom of the screen. Do you seen a globe, or a brickwall? If its a brick wall then you are stuck behind a firewall. Check your windows firewall, and allow Limewire as an exception. If its off, then go back to limewire, choose DISCONNECT. Wait about 30 seconds, then reconnect. For some reason that seems to help. <br>  <br>  Also, just to make sure you know this. If you are bit torrenting, you can't use limewire at the same time. Not only do they usually overlap ports, but they both eat bandwidth. One at a time.|`|qlug34rKaa	Firewall - Gone.<br>  Or are you searching indie crap? That usually won't show up.
D4jdJl7Oaa	if you can find someone who is using win 95, borrow their disk. win 95 is way out of date now so you wont be able to get any kind of updates anyway.|`|alH9Tlahaa	Go into your bios settings and make it boot to disk. It will search for the set up file on the disk, best way i know how without a start up disk..Steve
wJB5h4twaa	When you download it, save it to your computer (maybe desktop?)<br>  <br>  Then, find where you saved it and right click the file. Click "Open With" and find UTorrent in there. It should be listed.|`|9f65b445de39ef97322a63f4f8ca0938aa	Right click on the .torrent file, click on Open with and choose uTorrent. If uTorrent doenst appear use Choose program, and select uTorrent.<br>  <br>  If none of these things work, drag the .torrent file into the uTorrent.exe program
c57eb2355c0fe066a449984d45e7408faa	Yo tambien tenía EL MISMO PROBLEMA QUE VOS. Los modem que suelen tenerlos son los Modem de larga distancia. El Link (conección) se apaga cuando la internet esta muy saturada o concurrida. Vas a ver que es muy frecuente que se corte desde las 8 hasta las 10 debido a que en ese momento todo el mundo sale a ocupar el chat, MSN, controlar flogs, etc. Es un problema que lamentablemente no suele tener solución. Pero al cabo de cierta cantidad de tiempo (meses) se va llendo. Proba si es necesario, ajustar los cables del modem, del enchufe, de la computadora, etc.<br>  Espero haber respondido a tu pregunta suerte!!!|`|7c294F2Vaa	pues no lo dejes ir no es cierto.<br>  <br>  fijate en tu modem que tienes  si esta da?adas las entradas del cable o habla a tu copa?ia de internet que estes usando|`|0ea7HLsFaa	el adsl es la se?al que llega a tu modem y la cual permite que nabegues.<br>  <br>  checa que este bien conectada a tu cajita donde va el cable del telefono, si es necesario cambialo,<br>  <br>  saludos|`|GNObcJWhaa	pues lo ke yo haria me cambiaria de empresa porque asi te pueden robar mucho dinero

The cops handle things like prostitution and drugs, not missing photos and spam.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you don't give your password out to anyone you don't 100% trust, and you'll be fine. Apologize to everyone that got spammed, and go about replacing the lost pictures.|`|ZIPd99xtaa	Protect yourself and set a new, better, password then don't tell ANYONE what it is. <br>  <br>  The police wont do any thing, far to much work for a minor misdemeanor|`|JGHQAe6Yaa	wat the?? in san diego cops dont do sh*t. the cops will tell u to make a new one... the cops will just laugh at u.|`|AeV8KYL2aa	myspace isnt serious enough for cops to have to be notified<br>  just make a new one|`|M1uOgLvTaa	That's actually happened to me before too, there were random bullitons, and comments saying I hate you and stuff. I think it's just a computer virus, I don't think it's a certain person who wanted to hack into your MySpace so don't worry about it. Although, I don't think it's neccesary to notify the police. I would just change your password every so often.|`|bCjvZhFLaa	yeah the cops wont do anything. and if they could, they would first have to go through the courts to get a warrant to force myspace to give up their IP logs.  then they will have to get another warrant to force the internet service provider to tell them who that IP belongs to. <br>  <br>  way too much bureaucracy and red tape to go through for some teenage girls social life to remain in perfect working order.<br>  <br>  keep your password a secret, and don't pick one that's easy to guess.  Your myspace wasn't "hacked" into, i know from personal experience that the site has become very secure.  besides that, you're using the term "hack" in a way falsely propagated by the mass media.|`|94a249b1115ad4c50ac01a79188edc55aa	Hun, In this Case the cops will not do a thing. They dont handle cases like this, But you could Create a New Myspace, or Delete that one, Apologize to the people, and Dont tell anyone your password, Even if you know them, if you dont want to dont! If you do, you better trust them!<br>  <br>  And the pictures Try to re-upload them, and get them back!<br>  <br>  Good luck! [=<br>  P.S Dont Call the police for that, it will be an embarrassment in a way. They are not gonna do anything.|`|pVzprQJIaa	Wait, the cops are notified just for this myspace problem? I know it is identity theft in a way, and hacking, but, well, nevermind.<br>  <br>  But yeah, cops should be able to trace your IP address unless that person used something to change their IP address. You have got to be careful when giving out info.|`|7QqJBHzsaa	the cops will not do anything, simple reason all they did was change stuff. no major crime done.|`|VaFH2AY6aa	Yes they can. Unless he/she used a program to cover it up.

Otherwise it may try to boot from the hard drive. <br>  <br>  After a few minutes, you'll see a prompt to press the R key to start the Recovery Console. <br>  <br>  When Recovery Console starts, it will prompt you to enter a number corresponding to the Windows XP installation that you need to repair. In most cases, you'll enter "1" (which will be the only choice). If you press ENTER without typing a number, Recovery Console will quit and restart your computer. <br>  <br>  Enter your Administrator password. If you don't enter the correct password, you cannot continue.  (sometimes it's blank so just hit enter)<br>  <br>  At the Recovery Console command prompt, type fixmbr and then verify that you want to proceed.<br>  <br>  Then after the reboot, reinstall windows. or install linux ubuntu is not bad, and easy to use.|`|MA0nJLJtaa	take it to circuit city or best buy and ask them to look at it|`|b44bfe862fdfa24dc2637363590f46bfaa	I might be able to help, but I have a few questions.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	According to a few articles I've browsed AT&T is concerning themselves with P2P downloading. I have Comcast personally, and I haven't had any problems.
AA11733378	You should know it is illegal to use any p2p software for the purpose of copying copyrighted data i.e. music and videos.<br>  Peer to Peer (p2p) software has no inherent protection against viruses, spyware and other malicious content, it is up to you to know how it operates and know how to use your firewall and anti virus software.<br>  When installing p2p software you are agreeing to its terms which means your firewall may now allow that software full access to the internet and potentially your hard drive most likely without your knowledge.<br>  P2P software was originally intended for the transfer of public domain files between internet linked computers it was not designed specifically just for video and music files it can be used to transfer any kind of file.<br>  Software like Limewire does not itself contain viruses or spyware or adware but the files you download through it can. You need to quarantine any download files until they have been scanned i.e. you should not run them or play them or execute them until they have been scanned.<br>  If you do get a virus through a limewire download there is very little you can do legally especially if the file is copyrighted as you may well be the one who is prosecuted. <br>  If you accidentally get a virus through i tunes you paid for it and are protected in many countries by statute at the very least i tunes would have to give you a refund.<br>  My advice, for what it costs to buy a tune from i tunes or rent a movie don't be so cheap go buy it.|`|QmmZcaevaa	I use Utorrent<br>  <br>  |`|xpa0XpJSaa	no limewire is not safe. for one its illegal and it can be traced to your house. ppl hav gotten busted for using it, but the chances of this happening are really slim becuz so many ppl use it. but it makes ur computer really slow and u'll get a bunch of spyware and **** on it. wut i do is just keep a list of all the songs i want to add to itunes and then once its really long, i download limewire and download all the songs and then delete it off my computer.|`|72fdc7069226ef6684cc2ae18792a420aa	i have used 4 years now 500 cds burnt still waiting for the end of the world according to these noobs here <br>  if downloading tunes ...put in a folder on desktop ... scan folder with a good scanner <br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/A-squared-Free/3000-2239_4-10262215.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/A-squared-Free/3...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...</a>|`|VgQkKd9Kaa	No, after awhile it's gonna slow down your computer and then crash it, i would recommend using frostwire or imeem to download music.|`|HE2fMbfXaa	if you put it behind a firewall (besides windows, because it doesnt work to well)|`|n2r9eFqqaa	I say only use it for .wmp files (music), avoid .exe if you could (like programs)

Put the DVD in, open handbrake it will start ripping the DVD <br>  <br>  You can select the output in different formats. In your case you can select iPod format.(no need to understand mp3 or mp4 just select "iPod")<br>  <br>  In few minutes it will be done then just play the movie using itunes and sync your iPod and transfer the video.<br>  <br>  It might sound a bit complicated but it's so easy.<br>  <br>  Ones you start Handbrake, it will guide you through. <br>  <br>  You can do another thing but i don't if its legal. Play the DVD and record your Mac computer's screen. <br>  <br>  Mac can record the screen so whatever  playing on the screen, will be recorded in quicktime format which is compatible to iPod nano.I used to do that for my SAP computer software classes.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) The problem is that ALL conventional (current) hard disk drive technology is based on having smooth flat disk platters inside the drive unit. These use a magnetically coated media. i.e. a thin layer of material that is magnetic but HDD capacities depend on how dense you can make the magnetic material that coats each disk platter.<br>  <br>  **The problem is HDD manufacturers are fast approaching the limitations of the actual magnetic material on an atomic molecular level. And this means that disk drives might reach a certain limit of capacity and then the makers will have too look for another material before drives can increase in capacity again. Any new drives might use a different storage media which we have yet to see in every day use.<br>  <br>  **I'm sure disk drives will change in future and we might have storage devices based Not on magnetic coatings but on silicon crystals or silicon matrix or we might just store data inside a silicon chip instead.<br>  <br>  **I'm sure future generations of digital storage devices will hold hundreds of Terabytes or Peta-bytes of data. On a device no bigger than your big thumb nail? Its only limited by the laws of physics & nano technology and nano technology level engineering processes.<br>  <br>  Kind Regards Ivan<br>  <br>  computer veteran.|`|Vt0xnuWpaa	As you've said, technology is always changing very rapidly.

And once the internet session was ended the IP address was released back to the servers pool of IP's and so it could then be given to someone else. Its a very effective way of using IP addresses when you have a large number of users.<br>  <br>  **Once the DHCP server is set up and working it requires little or no intervention from the ISP as IP's are assigned & released almost by themselves.<br>  <br>  Ivan|`|sXTjYH7Iaa	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network application protocol used by devices (DHCP clients) to obtain configuration information for operation in an Internet Protocol network.

A2ZWKTiMaa	it's kind of funny that you know about SLi and GTX 285's and trip channels but nothing about Core i7..? anyways a i7 920 runs under a brand new architecture (Nahalam) which is different from C2D. It processes 8 threads comparing to C2D Quads which do 4 so in theory it is faster and the differences in real time performance is about anywhere from 10% - 30% remember only a selected few software out there are optimized for Quad Cores. back then, the famous Q6600 is just 2 dual core chips crammed into one, the 920 has all 4 cores sharing 1 large 8mb L3 cache instead of 2x 4mb L2 Cache like the q6600. Core i7's are all 45nm and made out to be very power efficient and should clock very well. It makes use of the latest X58 chipset which is certified to support both ATi Crossfire as well as Nvidia SLi. So this time around you get to choose which set of video cards you want to build pc with unlike P35,P45,x38,&x48 chips.  for ddr3's im suggesting Mushkins or Crucial Ballistixs.    vista's problem mainly has to do with its full feature of bells and whistles that constantly bringing down the user experience among entry-level pcs (low budget pc / out of date pc) Core i7 with GTX 285+ trip channel will chew it through like a piece gum. so when you use vista w/ those hardware you should be seeing vista as it 'should've been'    But if you are going to build a Core i7 now i would suggest you get a hold of whichever OS you can get Vista or XP for the least amount of money (better if it's free) and hold out for Windows 7, and forget about DX10 b/c Windows 7 will come with DX11 :)

Seeing messages about Windows previous settings is proof that you have no concerns with the video card.<br>  It looks as if the Windows startup/boot sequence cannot complete. Either one or more files were corrupted or an application recently installed prevents it from starting properly. You can try different things depending on the exact version of Windows you have. Check the articles below for XP (for example).<br>  All operations required to "repair" your system and recover the data that is normally still on the disk should be done by someone with advanced/expert knowledge at this stage. Make sure you have all the disks and documentation available before asking him/her to take a look. Your system might require a full reinstallation as somebody else suggested above. Be aware that trying to reinstall the system yourself you can unknowingly erase data otherwise still accessible.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	You need a page-layout application that can prepare files for printing. Adobe InDesign is a leading application of this kind. Quark XPress is a close competitor.  At one time, some yearbook publishing specialists were using PageMaker, but I don't know if that is still the case. FrameMaker is also an option.<br>  <br>  Don't use Microsoft Word, as this is for word processing, not page layout, and it's very difficult to work with for the latter purpose. Microsoft Publisher is very primitive compared to other page-layout programs and should be avoided (many printers hate it). Don't use Photoshop, as that is only for preparing images for page layout; it doesn't handle the page layout itself.<br>  <br>  If you have a publisher lined up for the yearbook, ask them which application they'd prefer you to use, if you don't have a preference yourself.|`|8012427537078e29822bf1bd1e533dfaaa	Hello LaLa.

bTSyWkWOaa	Well Utorrent is a peer to peer software, so download speed depends on the number of hosts. If a torrent has many seeds, the download will be fast, in the same way that if it has few seeds and a ton of leachers, the download will be slow.<br>  But speed issues can also be due to port forwarding. There's a couple of websites that can check if your ports are forwarded properly, so chack that too.|`|ULw1777caa	I'm guessing you don't understand how torrents work.

n2HaCqHwaa	Do you have a crossover cable to form a local network between the two computers? This is what I do when I want to access from my desktop the 3Mobile stick that I use on my laptop. Go into Control Panel and follow the Network Setup Wizard. You will need to do this on BOTH computers. Yes, I would expect that your broadband is currently configured for your computer. Crossover cable is just an ethernet cable but one that is used specifically to directly link two computers. It's all self explanatory. Just make sure to check where you're supposed to as to which computer connects directly to internet and which is receiving internet through another computer. Unsure how much crossover cable costs: I once lodged with a guy who was light years ahead of me - studying Cisco Systems. When he left, he left the cable behind and now it's mine! This method might cost you a little but at least you'll have learned something new...

They examine every object you download when you are looking at webpages.  In theory nothing should get past this scanning process.  However, trojans are different.  If someone sees a message box in the middle of the screen that says OK or Cancel and clicks the OK button out of frustration because the Cancel button does nothing but re-display the message box, then the user has given consent for the trojan (fake anti-virus program) to be installed.<br>  <br>  The likelihood is that you did not have 27 viruses.  If you had one then you were every unlucky.  I suspect those so-called viruses were merely tracking cookies (little text files) which do not cause any harm to your computer.<br>  <br>  THe best advice is to run AVG in safe mode.

If they don't have it she should raise 9 kinds of caine and demand that something be done.<br>  When the computer is running insert the CD and restart the computer. Follow the prompts to make the installation. The hard drive will be wiped clean and formatted. She will lose everything she ever saved or installed. It's like starting with a brand new computer. There may also be a CD with drivers on it. Insert it afterward and load the drivers. It's a royal pain but it has to be done. If she keeps Avast (I use it) Help her set it up and make sure she knows that the scan has to be started manually everyday. She should get some anti spyware like Windows Defender or Ad Aware. Make sure her firewall is on and automatic updates for Windows. It's a hard way to learn a lesson.

Irdj2KAFaa	A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without the permission or knowledge of the user. The term "virus" is also commonly but erroneously used to refer to other types of malware, adware and spyware programs that do not have the reproductive ability. A true virus can only spread from one computer to another when its host (some form of executable code) is taken to the target computer, for instance because a user sent it over a network or the Internet, or carried it on a removable medium such as a floppy disk, CD, or USB drive. Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by another computer.     Viruses are sometimes confused with computer worms and Trojan horses, which are technically different. A worm can spread itself to other computers without needing to be transferred as part of a host, and a Trojan horse is a program that appears harmless but has a hidden agenda. Worms and Trojans, like viruses, may cause harm to either a computer system's hosted data, functional performance, or networking throughput, when they are executed. Some viruses and other malware have symptoms noticeable to the computer user, but most are surreptitious. This makes it hard for the average user to notice, find and disable and is why specialist anti-virus programs are now commonplace.    Most personal computers are now connected to the Internet and to local area networks, facilitating the spread of malicious code. Today's viruses may also take advantage of network services such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, Instant Messaging and file sharing systems to spread, blurring the line between viruses and worms. Furthermore, some sources use an alternative terminology in which a virus is any form of self-replicating malware.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Stop doing this 'lil pukes homework for him...just go to his profile and see what he always asks...homework questions....

bp59GQ0yaa	It will boost (slightly) the performance of your computer (hard drive)<br>  by putting all the various parts of files in the same area of the disc thereby making the access to that file/app a bit quicker.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	Whenever you download lots of files ( or delete them for that matter ) the HDD is likely to get fragmented, which means files are not stored contiguously on the drive. In the graphic display, they appear as red lines. As a result, each time you want to open that file, the HDD has to work even more to gather all the fragments and read it. This is called fragmentation and causes the system to slowdown.<br>  <br>  The solution is to defrag the HDD as often as depending on the rate at which it gets fragmented. The defragger will put fragmented files back together contiguously improving data access time and speed. Defragged or contiguous files appear as blue lines. Regular defragging helps keep the system fast and smooth, your files and programs open up without lags.<br>  <br>  Windows comes witha built in defragger but it has its limitations. There are alternative defraggers like Diskeeper which have advanced automatic functions such as automatic background defrag, low free space defrag etc.<br>  Here is a free trial<br>  <a href="http://www.diskeeper.com/defrag.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.diskeeper.com/defrag.aspx</a>|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Here's a super-short answer: it puts pieces of the same file one after the other to reduce seeking time in your hard drive. And of course less seeking time translate into a faster system.|`|sXTjYH7Iaa	Defragmenting your hard disk is a great way to boost the performance of your computer. Though the term "defragment" sounds a little abrasive, it is actually a simple and helpful process. After all, a defragmented hard disk is a happy hard disk.<br>  <br>  Adding and deleting files from your hard disk is a common task. Unfortunately, this process is not always done very efficiently. For example, when you delete a bunch of little files and add a new large file, the file may get broken up into mulitple sections on the hard disk. The computer will still read the newly added file as a single valid file, but the drive will have to scan multiple parts of the disk to read it. Because hard disk seek time is one of the most significant bottlenecks in a computer's performance, this can drag down your computer's speed quite a bit. If you have a ton of "fragmented" files on your hard disk, you might hear extra grinding, sputtering, and other weird noises coming from your computer.<br>  <br>  You computer does not like having fragmented files any more than you do. This is why defragmenting your hard disk is such a good idea. When you start to hear extra grinding sounds, or your computer doesn't open files as quickly as it did before, it's time to defragment. With Windows, you can use the pre-installed Intel defragment program to defragment your hard disk. You can also use a commercial software program like Norton Utilities to defragment your hard disk more efficiently and with more options. For Mac users, a disk utility such as DiskWarrior or Tech Tool Pro is the only way to do it. If you use your computer daily, defragmenting your hard drive once a month should keep the fragment-fiends away.|`|vZMN82U8aa	ok youre baking a cake... <br>  <br>  but, the scales are nest door, the flour is two streets away and the eggs are in the chicken.... <br>  <br>  defragging puts all the parts together, so programmes run faster and access data faster, because its not got to hunt for it...<br>  <br>  its got nothing to do with memory...|`|PGMIrRrAaa	It makes it more efficient and therefore faster.|`|nr4y60l7aa	When you move files around the hard drive, they do not physically move on the surface of the disk, the computer just updates where to find them. So by moving relevant files closer together on the disk surface they are quicker to find and for the computer to use them together.<br>  <br>  That's Defraging!|`|p5ItsTEsaa	it puts the files closer together so when computer has to get files it doesn't take as long to do the task required|`|2GW5UDJPaa	It compresses everything so that there is more memory available on the hard drive.
rHqe7oMoaa	Defragmenting simply re-arranges the information on your hard drive and places it at the start.<br>  <br>  Think of it like you have a bookshelf with books laying down, out of order, back to front etc.. also with pages fallen out of them.<br>  <br>  Say you go and put all the pages back in the books (in order) and then arrange the books in the bookshelf in order as well starting from the left (start) of the bookshelf (with empty space at the end).<br>  <br>  This is what defragmenting is, but it does it with your programs and files instead.<br>  <br>  So the files/programs stored on your hard drive may be arranged like this before defragmenting (because they are in pieces): ( | = file fragment, - is empty space):<br>  <br>  |-------|||||-----|---|------|<br>  <br>  and would look like this after:<br>  <br>  |||||||||---------------------<br>  <br>  Your PC performance would be slowed down (the degree depends on how fragmented the drive/partition is) because parts of the file(s)/programs may be stored in difference places on the hard drive, instead of together.  <br>  <br>  You can defragment if you use windows, but you don't need to do it with Linux (it fixes itself).|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	As files are added or modified on a hard disk, the operating system will sometimes be unable to keep the entire file located in the same pysical place on the disk. (Contiguous space). So, the system has to place chunks of the file in whatever locations are available.<br>  <br>  This can slow performance because the drive has to do multiple reads to a variety of location to get the entire file into memory.<br>  <br>  Defragmentation is a process where all pieces of a file are rearranged in the proper order in a single contiguous location. Also, empty gaps on the drive surface a closed up, making disk reads faster and improving performance.

If you have a permanent workplace where you'll be using the computer a desktop is a better choice. <br>  <br>  Remember that laptops are often more expensive than desktops. And upgrading (videocard or CPU) is almost impossible for laptops.|`|NO7exZB1aa	Depends upon your needs. If you need remote computing, laptop is best. On the other hand, if you do not have much need for accessing a computing device, a Desktop PC is better.<br>  <br>  But I have my own opinions, as there is not much difference in the price range in PC and laptop,, i would suggest you a laptop. It will take less space in your room and you can carry it with you for important events. You can directly download the pix to the laptop when your phone memory gets full. You can also install the sound rec software in the laptop to record important lectures or anything (you may need audio rec software like Sound Forge). You can later transfer the audio to a CD so that the HDD does not get full. There are many advantages of owning a laptop over PC.

rq95j8f3aa	Hey, I just happen to be trying to do the exact same thing this evening. I found an answer on a forum describing how to install Riven, another popular old video game, on a vista system. Here is a copy of the post which helped me out.<br>  <br>  Re: Installing games w/Quicktime<br>  From Windows Vista RTM Software Compatibility List - IeXwiki<br>  <br>  Install the game but don't run it. Download this file (DLL from QuickTime 2), unzip it and copy all the files in the same directory where Riven (zoomi32) had been installed. Apply this unofficial patch afterwards and run the Game as administrator.<br>  <br>  Note this applies only to 32 bit Vista.<br>  <br>  The site that he referenced to get the zip file is here:<br>  <a href="http://files.filefront.com/QT2+32bit+essentialszip/;8480258;/fileinfo.html" rel="nofollow">http://files.filefront.com/QT2+32bit+ess...</a><br>  <br>  download that file, take its content and copy it into the zoombini folder in program files. After that I simply clicked on the zoombini.exe and the game worked. Do not worry about adding the unofficial patch.<br>  <br>  I did two other things to make it work.<br>  1: left clicked the zoombi32.exe file, selected properties, hit the compatibility tab, and set the file to be run in compatibility mode for windows 95.<br>  <br>  2: I uninstalled the current copy of quicktime that I had on my computer. I don't know if this is necessary but it is something that I did. <br>  <br>  After you copy the files it is not necessary to run the install program for Quicktime 2.1<br>  <br>  I hope that you have the same luck that I did with this.|`|ULw1777caa	Wow, that is an old version.

GxXpvNIwaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|i3zY7uKQaa	Try Formatting Your Computer After Formatting And Installing All Needed Softwares Use Acronis True Image Home For Making Image Of Your Computer From This You Don't Need To Format Your Computer

Also, it wouldn't hurt being careful and using proper anti-static handling techniques when dealing with delicate computer parts.|`|6LW8h4rTaa	Newegg.com doesn't make anything they sell. They just sell the same things you get from any other site. The quality depends on the product, and the company producing it, for better quality check the user revues and get the better product.<br>  <br>  Newegg has a very good return policy with fast processing. If you do have problems they take care of it fast.<br>  <br>  I have bought several dozen items (2 homebrew computers worth) from them with only one faulty product, and one mislabeled used product, both taken care of quickly, and to my satisfaction.<br>  <br>  They are a VERY reputable company, and you can do much worse.|`|Y0zwVG1Xaa	The computer being displayed as my profile pic was bought entirely from newegg. I have had it over a year now with no issues. I also built the girlfriends computer from parts bought entirely from newegg. Hers was built 3 weeks after I built mine (she wouldn't get off of mine after using it once). I also purchase a 40" samsung 1080p HDTV from newegg two months ago. Oh and both of our monitors came through newegg. I have NEVER had an issue with them. I shop there exclusively because I am so happy with them. However parts that are sensitive like motherboards do have issues in the manufacturing process.  Occasionally you will get a bad part (I've gotten pretty lucky). The downside is you are no longer dealing with newegg at that point. You must contact the manufacturer for replacement. If the part is broken physically then newegg will deal with it through UPS. As a side note I used to work at UPS part time. They insure every package up to $100. If you purchase something over $100 you may want to up the insurance. Then you will have a guarantee, but you still need to go through newegg for replacement as they receive the refund from UPS. Goofy policy, but it's in place to prevent fraud. So blame those people for making our life's difficult. <br>  <br>  Good luck on the new build.

ra69rxxgaa	It's probably got more to do with your internet connection and how it streams video on the internet.    Also, your Internet Service Providers speed can vary day to day. So some days videos might start right away, other days might not work as well.|`|LhEoVly0aa	ive been having a lot of trouble like this as well lately!|`|5QC0zaFfaa	BO NN SO NEMMENO A ME VA XDXDXDXD|`|F835DyDJaa	YouTube host a lot of different videos|`|9wjTgcPjaa	I've been experiencing this today a well.  It's not my internet connection (and it's probably not yours) because I can access other sites with other videos and they upload at normal speed.  Most likely,  Youtube is having issues with bandwidth in certain areas. A lot of people think it's the internet connection, but it's not.  Unfortunately there's just nothing we can do about it but ***** and moan. It DOES piss me off, though.
A2ZWKTiMaa	apparently there ARE such things from companies like IOgears etc. but they are USB connection i can only assume the speed is obviously inferior to the internal PCI, PCI-E, or even AGP for that matter.

Are you sure the graphics slot is pci-e 16? Look at the motherboard manual and see what kind off graphics slot it has.  If the graphics card is compatible with the motherboard all the other parts will not be a problem.  If your motherboard  has room for more ram and you want more ram that is a separate issue.  The cpu will not be affected by the graphics card.  Good luck|`|pwkeo7tTaa	No, at the most you will probably have to upgrade the PSU, but that depends on what you currently have.

6rR7LTl1aa	It's down to your own preferences, really.  I've got an iMac desktop, a laptop with XP-32, and another laptop with Vista-64, and they all play nice with each other (and me).    But then, I'm a software engineer/network admin/power user, so they blasted well better do as I say...    At any rate, 4 GB is enough for optimal performance on a Vista (64-bit version, 32-bit only "sees" 3.2-3.5 gigabytes of RAM) laptop.  What are its other specs, if you don't mind sharing?  Processor? Harddrive? GPU?|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Depends on how much RAM your new laptop has.  I run Vista and Windows 7 (dual boot configuration) on my laptop and everything is fine.  Microsoft support for XP will eventually end because Vista is the replacement for XP just as XP was the replacement for Windows 2000|`|AA12066574	If you're using 4GB of RAM, you'll have to use Vista. XP is limited to 2GB. That said, I like XP better. It's just a lot less complicated to live with.|`|8DDK2K5baa	I have used both    XP is 30 times better.    trust me    vista is horrible.    its so not user friendly.    it almost seems like XP would be the upgrade from vista|`|AA10628840	i would choose xp over vista reasons being    1.xp is more user friendly    2.xp can load any software whereas vista cant    3.xp can run on low power,speed and memory where as vista needs more    4.the vista interface is so complicated to use for beginners    5.when you load a software on xp they let you load it...but when you load it on vista they ask you a million questions why you want to load it    6.if you have a 4gb ram its better to go with xp    7.vista even though they have come out now for awhile they still have bug fixes and patches etc.so that means they are not perfect.    8.i cant think of any other...........reason.....hope i get the 10 points    9.if i were you i would try ubuntu.......................very good.i think its better then windows|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i got my pc w/ Vista pre-installed too, which was the first time i used it. i hated it at first cuz i was so used to XP, but i've had it for over a year now, and i actually love it. it look bout a month or 2 to get used to it bc u're given so many more options, so sometimes u get a little bit lost.     the only thing i didn't like bout Vista is that u can't actually customize it like XP w/ Style XP, nothing like that has been made for Vista yet, although i did find online a program that someone made for Vista that let u change the Login screen, which i haven't had any problems w/ at all. i do like the transparency option for the windows in Vista.    ps. to the previous answer, bout the downloading software, u can download any software u want w/ Vista, just as easy, there is nothing wrong w/ it.|`|FK0tfWlXaa	XP is more stable at the moment most of the programs are designed for it I find that Vista can be very problematic. Even though software company suggest that it can handle vista tends to have problem running it. So if i were you stay with Xp for now.|`|AA12225920	for laptops i prefer Vista.  and desktops are best with xp  but... XP is more faster and takes less ram  so if u run a program in xp that takes 512 ram then u need 1gb in Vista  if u need a pc for more of a buisnees typen then vista is probably more better|`|NkbhHcIAaa	there is simply no question as to the better OS .     XP Pro is 100 times better then vista
WQ0DzpByaa	Plug it into your usb port  Put your install disk in the CD drive  If it doesn't autostart the install, go to  Control Panel> System> Hardware > Device Manager   Look for the bodybugg under disk drives.

When it asks where to look, click browse and point the install to the CD Then click open or OK.  It should find your drivers and install them.

jdMXm55saa	In short it really doesn't matter what the lights do, it only really matters what speed you get when you plug it in.    GPRS is - a packet radio signal - basically v.slow internet  EDGE is a poor man's 3G  3G will give you speeds of upto 0,3MB/s - which will give you a broadband esq experience for general surfing.  HSDPA is High Speed Download Packet Access - or what some people call 3G on steriods.  It speeds up the connection available over 3G.  Orange currently have a 3.6MB/s version deployed, as opposed to Voda and T-Mobile's 7.2 MB/s.    WAY too much info??    Like I say ignore the lights just plug it in and see if it'll do what you want it to.  If not move somewhere else.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	GPRS and Edge 3G are different cellphone hi-speed digital modes.  HSDPA is a 3G mode.  You're on broadband internet.  It probably turns one color for GPRS and another for 3G, or something.  As long as the color it is, is "good", don't worry.  (Or call tech support at your carrier and ask - they'll know the dongle they use and how it works.)|`|ye1tS9a2aa	gprs is a radio navigation system from satalites above|`|KqIDH7oVaa	couldnt tell you what they mean but im on  a dongle and i always opt for the 3g it works faster for me, its in the settings|`|AA11256390	They are basically different speeds of mobile internet, GPRS/Edge is the slowest most basic, HSDPA is a form of 3G both which are at present the fastest versions. HSDPA I think is faster than 3G (until 4G comes out). The LED indicators will be to let you know which you are on as depending on where you are HSDPA or 3G may not be available.

Elobl7qdaa	Looks like 8 to me.    Ron|`|p73rMilqaa	The mov instruction puts its second parameter (the numbers) into a register (that's the first parameter). The push instruction puts something into the stack and the pop removes something from the stack. I believe after this explanation it is really easy to tell what is in the stack. I don't want to give you the full answer because that wouldn't help you learn this.  No, the answer is not 8:)  Little more help: If you put something into the stack it ends up on the top of of the stack. Example:  If you push 5, 9, 7 into the stack in this order then the stack will look like this:  7  9  5  If you say pop now it removes the element on the top of the stack.  So the stack will look like this  9  5

j4x4CW1Baa	As it turns out, there are hundreds of companies that will sell you CDs filled with millions of valid e-mail addresses. With Microsoft Word you could easily format those addresses into lines of 100 addresses each, and then cut and paste those lines into the "To:" field of any normal e-mail program. Every time you push the "Send" button, which would be about once every 5 seconds, you would make $10. You would be making something like $700 per hour.     This is the problem with spam. It is incredibly easy for you to send it. It costs you practically nothing to send it. And even with a response rate as low as one sale out of 10,000 e-mails, it can be quite lucrative for you to send it. Therefore, if you don't mind the fact that you are creating e-mail pollution for millions of people, you might decide to send e-mail messages about your grandmother's muffins all day long.     Where does a company get millions of valid e-mail addresses to put on a CD and sell to you? There are a number of primary sources.     The first is newsgroups and chat rooms, especially on big sites like AOL. People (especially first-time users) often use their screen names, or leave their actual e-mail addresses, in newsgroups. Spammers use pieces of software to extract the screen names and e-mail addresses automatically.     The second source for e-mail addresses is the Web itself. There are tens of millions of Web sites, and spammers can create search engines that spider the Web specifically looking for the telltale "@" sign that indicates an e-mail address. The programs that do the spidering are often called spambots.     The third source is sites created specifically to attract e-mail addresses. For example, a spammer creates a site that says, "Win $1 million!!! Just type your e-mail address here!" In the past, lots of large sites also sold the e-mail addresses of their members. Or the sites created "opt-in" e-mail lists by asking, "Would you like to receive e-mail newsletters from our partners?" If you answered yes, your address was then sold to a spammer.     E-mail addresses generally are not private (just like your phone number is not private if it is listed in the phone book). Once a spammer gets a hold of your e-mail address and starts sharing it with other spammers, you are likely to get a lot of spam.     From "How Stuff Works" All rights reserved.

lpjPWSxvaa	No overclocking options are available in any of the BIOS releases - so the answer to your most basic question is no.  That being said, a few hints that will make a big speed difference:<br>  * Ensure you power profile is set to performance so the CPU will not be locked at a lower speed or auto-throttling up and down in response to load.  Maximum CPU clock performance that way.<br>  * Eliminate bottlenecks by upgrading to 2 gigs of RAM.  Many S10's come with only 512 megs of RAM, upgrade to 2 gigs for less than $25 and you will see significantly improved multi-tasking performance.  Hit me up on email if you need a link to the correct RAM to install - doesn't take more than 5 minutes to install it and all you need is a screwdriver to pull 2 screws.<br>  * Eliminate the drag on system resources (both RAM and CPU) by ditching the stock anti-virus - it's a hog.  Replace with one called Comodo - it's a much 'lighter' but very effective application.<br>  <br>  Good luck, with the combo listed above you should love your S10 - I know I love mine.|`|0m1PMsHaaa	No.

If you're trying to see someone's comments that are "hidden" then you go to the top of mozilla click view/page style/no style. Thus for removing there page layout and revealing their hidden comments. Another way to view your comments is to find your friend ID # ex. 6656454869 which is located in the address bar in certain pages of your myspace. You copy and go to someone's page click view all comments and copy and paste your friend ID where there's is replacing it. Then hit enter. That will bring up YOUR comments. To reverse this find their friend ID # go and view YOUR comments and replace your friend ID # with there's and hit enter. Good luck...be more specific if I didn't give you the answer you wanted.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Consider an OS other than Linux.  Linux distributions are often extremely bloated, but you can get other operating systems that are actual descendants of UNIX that are much leaner. FreeBSD and the other BSD variants come to mind.  These other operating systems install by default with a smaller selection of services installed, and so they are easier to strip down to the bare essentials.  That is, with a Linux distribution you'll be busy removing (and possibly breaking) things, whereas with these other operating systems, you'll simply not install the things you don't want to begin with.|`|pwkeo7tTaa	You're so naughty, you barely know Linux and now you want to strip her down.|`|3XMCQ4Spaa	I think it would be easier to build-up to a working minimal distro, than trying to strip-down one of the as-usual bloated distro, as you're likely to have to leave a lot due to dependencies.<br>  <br>  Take a look at Linux-from-Scratch (<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).</a><br>  <br>  There's a book as well as a live boot-CD and some minimal packages.  With it you can make your own linux "distro" from scratch, and you can add just what you need.

Also here you strart from "scratch", but the building process is automated (although from source) and there is a packagemanager keeping track of things.  The great thing though, is that you don't have to install much that what you absolute need.<br>  <br>  For both -- when your done -- you could possible remove stuff like the c-compiler, many commands (e.g. filters like head, tail, sort, uniq,  ...) and other stuff, to streamline it even more... at least if you're not planning on adding more stuff.  Alternatively, build in on one computer, and copy only the bare minimum (not the compiler and such) to an other computer.|`|75nbESJUaa	Mini Linux fits on a Memory Card.

Even with a proper firewall, by default, some already allow connections without your approval. Examples of this would be Windows Update. <br>  <br>    If your trying to slow outbound traffic, install a proper firewall (Windows Firewall doesn't cut it), and allow/deny programs to the internet when it prompts. Be warned, usually firewalls make rules on your first answer, so it only asks once, after that, you have to edit your policy if you made a mistake.<br>  <br>    If you just want to see whats going on, google for a network traffic application.

The burning program will tell you to insert blank disc, but read carefully as it tells you what type.  It will say insert blank CD-R for example.

rl530Za9aa	The first thing you need to do is make sure your video card drivers are up to date. Check who manufactured your GeForce. Manufacturer's such as PNY, Evga and such might have edited video drivers for your specific card. Do not download them from the NVidia website unless specifically told too, always use your manufacturers site.<br>  <br>    Your second option is to check your graphic settings in Call of Duty. Try changing such options as Specular Map, Depth of Field and other such options until you see an improvement. I would highly recommend using the "Optimal Video Settings" that Call of Duty offers as the first method. If that works, gradually increase the graphic settings until the issue comes back, then you will know what setting caused this.

rHqe7oMoaa	Defragmenting simply re-arranges the information on your hard drive and places it at the start. <br>  <br>  Think of it like you have a bookshelf with books laying down, out of order, back to front etc..  also  with pages fallen out of them. <br>  <br>  Say you go and put all the pages back in the books (in order) and then arrange the books in the bookshelf in order as well starting from the left (start) of the bookshelf (with empty space at the end). <br>  <br>  This is what defragmenting is, but it does it with your programs and files instead. <br>  <br>  So the files/programs stored on your hard drive may be arranged like this before defragmenting (because they are in pieces): ( | = file fragment, - is empty space):<br>  <br>  |-------|||||-----|---|------|<br>  <br>  and would look like this after:<br>  <br>  |||||||||---------------------<br>  <br>  <br>  I have never heard of defragging causing hard drive failure. It could be that your hard drive died coincidentally.|`|X4hz3a9haa	No there's no harm to drives when you defrag, its good to do it regularly as it cleans up all the (rearranges them)  files you have accumulated on your pc/laptop which can slow down your pc. i also have never heard the message "no hard drives found" when a defrag as been done, it should not have cause any damage at all.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	Defragmenting does not adversly affect the drive at all. You just need to run it right and also ensure there is no powercut in the midst of the defrag process as its accessing and rearranging files on your HDD.<br>  I always recommend a good and reliable defragmenter, Diskeeper which once installed automatically does the job without requiring manual input.|`|rl530Za9aa	Defragmenting your hard drive poses no threat to a correctly working hard drive as long as it defragments successfully without interruption. <br>  <br>  Closing or shutting down the computer in the middle of defragmentation can cause corruption on your hard drive, however, it will not cause your BIOS to stop detection of a hard drive. If this happens, there is another issue with the drive itself.<br>  <br>  If the BIOS does not detect the hard drive and no configurations have been changed, then you need a new hard. If the BIOS does in fact see the hard drive, but will not boot to Windows or your OS, run a recovery disc and see if it can repair it. If you do not have a recovery disc, reinstall Windows(Or other OS) and format the hard drive. Formatting and reinstalling deletes all files on your hard drive, but this is a last resort after all other options are exhausted.|`|vc3maF3Faa	There is no harm in defragmenting the hard drive. It just re-arrange your files so that the computer will not have a hard time reading and searching for it. May be your hard drive is really going out and after defragmentation it died that's why it can't be detected.|`|VbP8YWonaa	Defragmenting a hard drive does no harm. As to why rebooting said there was no hard drive. I haven't heard of this one. Did you start and stop defrag several times? Try booting into safe mode and defrag the drive. Shut down the computer and then reboot. This may fix what ever the issue is.

rl530Za9aa	Daemon Tools is a widely used CD/DVD emulation program. It takes images made from CDs/DVDs and emulates it to make your computer think it has another drive with a disc inserted.<br>  <br>  If you want to make a backup of your game and put it on your hard drive, you will need to use a program to create a "CD image" of that disc and then load it using Daemon Tools. Where it says "Device 0: No Media" is where you click to load it from.<br>  <br>  Most games have protection against making backup copies of the disc which interfere in the copy process or stop it from making original copies, effectively making Daemon Tools useless since it will not see it as the original disc.<br>  <br>  If legal where you live and by the publisher, search for a no-cd executeable for the game. Its easier, more legal in some areas and you won't have to copy an entire CD to your hard drive to waste space.

SkpRC2Nmaa	Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), or IMT Single Carrier (IMT-SC) is a backward-compatible digital mobile phone technology that allows improved data transmission rates, as an extension on top of standard GSM. EDGE can be considered a 3G radio technology and is part of ITU's 3G definition,[1] but is most frequently referred to as 2.75G. EDGE was deployed on GSM networks beginning in 2003— initially by Cingular (now AT&T) in the United States.[2]<br>  <br>  EDGE is standardized by 3GPP as part of the GSM family, and it is an upgrade that provides a potential three-fold increase in capacity of GSM/GPRS networks. The specification achieves higher data-rates by switching to more sophisticated methods of coding, within existing GSM timeslots. Introducing 8PSK encoding, EDGE is capable of delivering higher bit-rates per radio channel in good conditions.<br>  <br>  EDGE can be used for any packet switched application, such as an Internet connection. High-speed data applications such as video services and other multimedia benefit from EGPRS' increased data capacity. EDGE Circuit Switched is a possible future development[citation needed].<br>  <br>  Evolved EDGE was added in Release 7 of the 3GPP standard. This is a further extension on top of EDGE, providing reduced latency and potential speeds of 1Mbit/s by using even more complex coding functions than the 8PSK originally introduced with EDGE.<br>  <br>  EDGE/EGPRS is implemented as a bolt-on enhancement for 2G and 2.5G GSM and GPRS networks, making it easier for existing GSM carriers to upgrade to it. EDGE/EGPRS is a superset to GPRS and can function on any network with GPRS deployed on it, provided the carrier implements the necessary upgrade.<br>  <br>  Although EDGE requires no hardware or software changes to be made in GSM core networks, base stations must be modified. EDGE compatible transceiver units must be installed and the base station subsystem needs to be upgraded to support EDGE. If the operator already has this in place, which is often the case today, the network can be upgraded to EDGE by activating an optional software feature. Today EDGE is supported by all major chip vendors for GSM. New mobile terminal hardware and software is also required to decode/encode the new modulation and coding schemes and carry the higher user data rates to implement new services.<br>  <br>  Transmission techniques<br>  <br>  In addition to Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK), EDGE uses higher-order PSK/8 phase shift keying (8PSK) for the upper five of its nine modulation and coding schemes. EDGE produces a 3-bit word for every change in carrier phase. This effectively triples the gross data rate offered by GSM. EDGE, like GPRS, uses a rate adaptation algorithm that adapts the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) according to the quality of the radio channel, and thus the bit rate and robustness of data transmission. It introduces a new technology not found in GPRS, Incremental Redundancy, which, instead of retransmitting disturbed packets, sends more redundancy information to be combined in the receiver. This increases the probability of correct decoding.<br>  <br>  EDGE can carry data speeds up to 236.8 kbit/s (with end-to-end latency of less than 150 ms) for 4 timeslots (theoretical maximum is 473.6 kbit/s for 8 timeslots) in packet mode. This means it can handle four times as much traffic as standard GPRS. EDGE will therefore meets the International Telecommunications Union's requirement for a 3G network, and has been accepted by the ITU as part of the IMT-2000 family of 3G standards. It also enhances the circuit data mode called HSCSD, increasing the data rate of this service.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Da...</a>
Y0zwVG1Xaa	I think you want to know how to remove all errors from the hard drive without reinstalling the operating system? <br>  <br>  It depends on what kind of errors you are talking about. Spyware and anti-virus can go a long way. Update your drivers. Install the latest windows updates. Do a disk clean-up and defragment the hard drive are go too. Also I would eliminate all my unused programs through the add/remove programs feature in the control panel. You should do most of this through safe mode if there is a lot of junk causing you problems. Do this by restarting the computer and pressing f8 as soon as the computer starts to boot.|`|ULw1777caa	Can you rephrase into an actual sentence?|`|cb1c50cc60d5c0795c376d52d5267237aa	if you want to remove all the errors based on the system files of windows xp...<br>  <br>  you can use System File Checker (SFC) .. a system utility which helps you to scan and change the corrupted system file to its original version...<br>  <br>  you should have windows xp original cd with you before starting SFC|`|sU92tGxfaa	well i can certainlly help you in that.<br>  <br>  I've posted a complete article on it here:|`|d1HMEm6vaa	you can also try system restore.....<br>  <br>  Start ---->All Programs------>Accessories-------->Syste...

However you are limited and cannot use border art. However, if instead of using the conventional way of adding a page border, create a table, (or even text box) one column one row, make it the size of the page, i.e. A4page is 21cm x 29.7cm portrait so assuming 2.54 margins all way round, make your table 16cm x 24cm then you can use right button of mouse in the table down to borders and shading and you can click on the border art button and the sky is practically the limit."

I have seen this occur if the outlet strip has a defective surge system.  <br>  <br>  Check to be sure it is using the correct adapter. (not too likely but I have seen the wrong adapters connected to routers causing all sorts of issues.)<br>  <br>  Connect to a UPS *Uninterruptible power supply these provide a high level of filtering and protection from power loss. Get a true sine wave unit to prevent damage to the DC adapters!<br>  <br>  If all that fails get a replacement modem, they can be or go bad.

If you then switch to datasheet view when you click in that field you will see downward arrow which means that there is a list and probably as you know you don't even have to click on it, you can merely type M or F and the word will come up. Anyhow, if you then create a form from this table, exactly the same happens, you have a text frame with a downward arrow at the side. Possibly you have not created the field in quite the right format if this is not happening so I would suggest going back to design view of your table and changing the data type, saving and then design view of your form, clicking right button in the top left hand box with the black box in and re-associating the form with the updated table so that the form itself is then updated.

When it does this, it opposes the charging current.  The battery will be useless and has to be replaced.<br>  <br>  Also a flat battery that is down, but not enough to go faulty as above, can take a really long time to fully charge.  The reason is that the voltage comes up really quickly, which restricts the current from charging a reasonable amount to a trickle.  The light may say charged because the voltage is ok, but the battery goes flat quickly because the quantity is lacking.  Resolution: you have to leave on charge a really long time, like 3 - 7 days..|`|tl8e4KyGaa	yes that happens and yes you need a replacement battery.<br>  <br>  My one dies in less than 30 mins|`|Ao0ZyjCraa	There is no thumb rule that you have to keep charging while working but you have to ensure that you are charging it to 100%. Every laptop will have a battery power checking utility, or you can see the same in the power options if you are using Windows.<br>  <br>  But yes most laptops need a replacement at some point of time. It all depends on the environment and how frequent you use it. Keeping your battery on room temperature improves the life.<br>  <br>  Before doing anything I would advice you to check whether you are charging to 100%<br>  Check if your power options are good e.g) set it turn off monitor if the computer is idle for more than 3 minutes.<br>  <br>  Windows provides a lot of options in the power section.

BhNP2P8Xaa	well, if the router is typical (such as the ones we use here in the US), the passwords are usually set by the *user.* (That would be you). However, someone else may have done this, so the only thing you can do is reset it to the factory settings and log in that way.<br>  <br>  There should be a reset button on the outside of the unit (usually recessed in a small hole). Power up the router, then press and hold that button for about 15 seconds (the lights will probably blink to indicate it's done).<br>  <br>  According to what I found with a Google search (Google *is* your friend), the IP is 192.168.2.1 and the standard password is "admin" (no user ID).<br>  <br>  You should change this to something meaningful to you.

I do not want to just give you the answer.<br>  <br>  I don't believe you should use for loops for this problem except to display the answer.<br>  <br>  It is better to use a while or do while loop and independently increment or decrement the subscripts.  <br>  You then need to workout how to adjust the subscripts to put the number in the right place in the array.<br>  <br>  There are two things that can change the direction of placing of numbers in the array.<br>  One of the subscripts going out of range (negative or positive)<br>  A value is already in the next array position.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  Have fun.

2eNX1wnJaa	I'll assume you are interested in building a desktop Personal Computer. However, before I go into the details, let me share a thought. Laptops today seem to outsell desktops and they are also very affordable these days.<br>  <br>  If this is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) project, you need to collect the following items:<br>  <br>  1. Casing with Power Supply (recommended 300W or more). Casing can be based on your preference. Make sure casing is well-manufactured and provides a stable foundation to the other components.<br>  <br>  2. Decide on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) a.k.a "processor." Essentially, your choices are Intel or AMD. AMD may be cheaper with equivalent characteristics. If you buy a boxed CPU (a.k.a retail version), you'll probably get the fan and thermal insulation with the "box." <br>  <br>  3. Motherboard. These days, you'll probably want a motherboard with graphics card already built, unless you're building a dedicated gaming PC. Motherboard must be compatible with your CPU. Usually, Intel and AMD processors require different motherboards; even the CPU family/speed must be compatible with the motherboard. To make it easier, look for a "combo" deal at your computer store ("combo" as in motherboard and CPU together). Motherboard should also be compatibl with your casing (likely to be "ATX").<br>  <br>  4. You need a hard disk. Without going into the details, assuming your motherboard supports "SATA II" just go and buy a "SATA II" drive of the capacity you would like.<br>  <br>  5. You need a CDROM/DVD (optional: Blu Ray) that an read and/or write, in order to install an operating system into your hard disk. <br>  <br>  That's about it! Your biggest challenge, if you've never done it before, will be to assemble the whole thing together.|`|elY5vkVyaa	This site has a couple of useful tutorials:<br>  <a href="http://www.buildyourown.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buildyourown.org.uk/</a>|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Case<br>  Motherboard<br>  CPU<br>  Memory sticks<br>  Power supply<br>  One or more disk drives<br>  One or more CD/DVD drives, as needed<br>  Floppy disk drive (if you think you'll need one)<br>  Video card (if not on the motherboard, or if you need a fancy one)<br>  Fans (if not included with the case, or if you want extra fans)<br>  Keyboard and mouse<br>  Monitor<br>  <br>  You'll need a Philips-head screwdriver to put it all together.<br>  <br>  You'll also need an operating system, such as Windows or Linux (the choices are quite limited).  If you buy a commercial operating system such as Windows, it will probably be the most expensive part of the computer. Try to buy an OEM copy if you are building your own machine, as they are cheaper than retail copies (however, no technical support is available for OEM copies).|`|NxBljj6Baa	<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811156226" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> Case $40 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817170017" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> 575W power supply $30 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131335" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> P45 motherboard $100 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115037" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> e8400 $165 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231166" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> 4gigs 1066mhz ram $55 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136074" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> 320gig hard drive $55 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827106287" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> DVD burner $22 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161236" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> 4870 $185 shipped<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832116488" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a> x64bit vista $99 shipped<br>  Grand total on this system is $751 shipped.  You can do a couple of things to cut your costs, but this is almost a premium system.  To by this system at a store would be about $1000...  You could go to an onboard graphics motherboard, and delete the graphics card for awhile.  You could also go with a 9600 nvidia card or a 4670 that sells for $80 shipped on newegg, they are good cheap cards.  You can cut from 4gigs 1066 ram to 2gigs and go from 1066mhz to 800mhz.  I really wouldn't do that to the ram though.  You can find a case with a power supply included, but you take the chance of getting a cheap quality PSU.  The operating systems on newegg are all about the same price, you can go with XP for $89.  Really I wouldn't cut corners on the CPU, but you could go back to an e7400 for $120 shipped...  <br>  I have that same motherboard and it is rock solid with my q6600, that e8400 is faster in gaming than my q6600.  I have a 4870 like I put in the list, it runs crysis and all my other games on high settings with little to no problems.  I am using it on a 61" HDTV so I should be pushing it to the extreme with 1920x1080 graphics.<br>  You could save even more if you go with AMD, but you will not get the performance and really only save $50 with an AMD CPU and motherboard.  I am an AMD fan, and I have built a many brand new $300 systems for people, but I will tell you, they aren't going to do what my intel does.

I would suggest you a below configuration for a normal desktop.<br>  <br>  1. Intel Core 2 Quad / Duo Processor (Quad is more faster than Duo. The more the clock speed and cache size, the better. I7 is the latest processor and fastest desktop processor in market)<br>  2. Intel  Motherboard 965 series (based on your cabinet size and options needed like 5.1 sound etc, get the mother board)<br>  3. 250 GB Seagate SATA HDD<br>  4. DVD Burner (LG/Samsung)<br>  5. Cabinet with 750W SMPS<br>  6. 128/256 MB Nvidia display card (more the ram, more the clarity and speed. if you are a gamer go for more than 512 MB)<br>  7. 2GB DDR3 RAM<br>  8. Microsoft Keyboard and mouse (I feel they are the best)<br>  9. 19" wide screen monitor (LG / Samsung)<br>  <br>  Brands are named on my preference. If you can give up a little of performance for price then go for AMD processor and supported motherboard.<br>  <br>  But I would suggest going for a Dell desktop; they are cheaper.

Its normally the hardware which emulates them as different processor and shows it to the OS. But a 64 bit OS is better in performance than the 32 bit.
