20090202104537AAFkC6m	Society & Culture;Languages	Where's english spoken like this? Where's this guy from? Where's the guy who tells the instructions from?	Where do you think this guy's from? Listen to his accent. I don't know whether he is a native speaker, but this accent is from another english-speakin' country (he doesn't sound like an american to me), or whether he is a foreigner trying to speak english. Could you help me?      This guy's accent is what I want to identify:    Exercise 1.  http://www.zshare.net/audio/550130780bf7...    Exercise 2.  http://www.zshare.net/audio/550134850cbc...       I'm learning english, and although I undertand what people says; it's hard to me to distinguish english accents, so I was given some listening exercises.       The first one's about understanding funny accents, I had to listen well to some little ones speaking and recognize their funny accent. If I just understand what they're saying, that's not funny; but if I listen well HOW they say it, then it's funny.        http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=lrDixgft1A...     http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=Psv75mhoNN...     http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sS...       The second one (this is where I need your help) is about telling where the people speaking is from.       The fisrt wo links above (exercises 1 and 2) are links to hear the instructions. I think I was able to do my homework, but although I could distinguish between the accents in the exercises, I was asked latter to answer where the guy who tells the instructions is from. He    doesn't sound like anamerican to me, could you tell me where that accent is from? Is he a native speaker (but from another country) or is he form a non-english-speaking country and he's speaking english? if so: where do you think he is from? It's hard to me to identify that accent.

I'm not sure if I'm getting paranoid or what, but I have this terrible feeling that false rumors are going on behind my back at church.  I know it doesn't matter what people think about me, but I would like to clear it up if there are false things.  Last night someone came to my husband and I and wanted us to go up to get our marriage prayed for.  While, our marriage may not be perfect, I don't know why they would pinpoint us.  It comfirmed some of my thoughts about false rumors going around.  There have been some other clues that it is happening, and someone recently was asked to leave church over some false rumors they were involved with.  My question is: how can I find out without sounding totally paranoid?  Or...am I just paranoid?

20090202110448AA19cZT	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	How can we support our brothers who are in need or who have suffered disasters?	What are our duties towards our Muslim brothers who have been stricken by calamities and disasters throughout the world?         Praise be to Allaah.      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):      “The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion)…” [al-Hujuraat 49:10]      And He describes them (interpretation of the meaning):      “…severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves…” [al-Fath 48:29]      The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The relationship of the believer towards the people of faith is like that of the head to the body. The believer feels the pain of the people of faith just as the body feels the pain of the head.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad).      Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) neatly summed up the ways in which a believer can support his fellow-believer. He said:      There are different ways of supporting a fellow believer: with one’s wealth, with one’s position of authority or power, by means of physical service, by offering sincere advice and guidance, by making supplication (du’aa’) and asking for forgiveness for them, and by feeling their pain. The level of one’s support will be affected by the level of one's faith. The weaker a person's faith, the weaker his support will be; the stronger the faith, the stronger the support. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the greatest of all people in his support for his companions, so the more closely his followers follow him, the greater will be their support for their fellow-believers.      (al-Fawaa’id, 1/171)      Al-Khaleel ibn Ahmad was walking with a companion of his when his companion’s shoe broke, so he carried his shoes and walked barefoot. Al-Khaleel took off his own shoes and carried them and walked barefoot. His companion asked him why he was doing that, and he said, “I am showing sympathy for you in your being barefoot.”         Islam Q&A    Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

I am watching these shows together with my children, and it received my notice, that a lot of things are "unnoticed" when it comes to the teachings of Islaam...       Like in Sesamstreet, the grown up plays along with a child of 5 years in a restaurant (with plastic food toys) and when the boy asks, what do you want to drink besides eating your meal?, the person answers i would like to drink a glass of wine.... Ya Allaah, from all the things you can drink you must say "wine"?       Now i am recording these televisionshows and i adopt only the things that are "halaal" for a child of 4 years to see...

20090202113630AAhfFkE	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Should I go on the adventure or not, I have 20 minutes to decide?	Currently I am in my senior year of college, and spring break is coming up. Originally I had no plans because I wanted to keep it up open in case I wanted to go visit a graduate school, or go somewhere for a job interview. My other thought was to go on an alternative spring break, where I would serve for a week in a fun city. Now there is an open spot for one of the trips that I could go on, I’ve already been to the city that it’s at. I also know no one that’s going, there’s a total of 20 people going. I have done one before, and I made a lot of friends, only that time I signed up earlier. This would be a last minute sign up, so I would have not yet participated in any of the group activities they have already had to get to know each other. I just wanted to do SOMETHING over break. I have 20 minutes to decide if I want to go on it or not. It costs $265, money that I could use toward something else. If I don’t go on the alternative break, I would spend my break relaxing at home with my family, applying for jobs, catching up on schoolwork, etc. It just seemed like a boring spring break.  Suggestions?

20090202113352AAlvtLm	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is there a way to destroy my fetish, without dying?	I found out about my fetish while driving past a high school full of girls.  I was 23 and they were being dismissed, early, on Thursday, April 12, 1979.   There were no buses there, so these high school girls formed a sort of parade walking toward the bus stop a block away.  Usually, buses would block a persons view of this sight.      I had been getting turned on for decades about 20 to 30 times a day, when nothing sexual was taking place.  I did not know why.   When I rode by this high school that day, I began to understand my strange fetish.      I was thrilled with it.  Wow, something that I can see almost anywhere (at that time), at almost anytime, and it turns me on more than anything!  I loved it!!!!!      For years, I went places to watch this fetish in the concentrated manner that I saw it on April 12, 1979: girls high schools at dismissal, night clubs, fast food restaurants, bars with lots of women.  I loved it because I could masturbate to the thought of it, after seeing it.  The more girls/women I saw doing my fetish, the more turned on I would get.  I used the number of women doing my fetish to express the temperature of a nightclub.  It was real hot, in fact, it was 117 degrees at Club Enchantee on Saturday   November 18, 1989 and it was 126 degrees at Taylors on Saturday November 25, 1989.      I came up with a language for it:    Baber  a woman/girl who does my fetish.    Shotgun baber  a girl under 14 who does my fetish.     Gapjaw baber -  a woman/girl who never did my fetish, but suddenly and inexplicably does it.     Super baber  A woman/girl doing the more masculine version of the fetish, a fad with women in 1996,    Slap and gap baber  A woman/girl who does my fetish in places that it is not permitted,  There were very few placed that my fetish was not permitted in 1979 however, just about everywhere today.    Acing  The act of a girl/woman doing my fetish in a guys face.  She aced him.        It was about 15 years later on Monday, April 11, 1994, that I determined why this terribly disgusting thing that had no relationship to sex, whatsoever, turned me on.   For me, I discovered that day that it was a gay (or bisexual) fantasy.   I did not like that!    Essentially, the woman who does this, creates an image in my mind (and probably, no one elses) of a hermaphrodite who is conspicuously masturbating in public.  Yeah, as gay as it is, that concept turned me on, unfortunately.  Yeah, I know she is not a hermaphrodite, and I know she is not masturbating.  In fact, any women doing this, probably would be greatly upset to know she placed this image into my mind.   This disgusts/sickens everyone around her, especially, because she is doing it so close to them.  The fact that she is so pretty and she wants to do something that is so disgusting to so many is also part of the turn on.       Usually the first time I see a girl/woman doing this in front of me, is the most exciting.   After that, the thrill starts to diminish.          As sick as this it, I never (up to now) wanted to get rid of it.  Therefore, I never sought psychological help.  I am certain most people would have told me to Youre sick man!   Go see a psychologist/psychiatrist, if they knew.  But, I felt I could not go to a psychiatrist/psychologist, because I did not want to get rid of it.  Now after decades of relishing my fetish, I want to get rid of it.      I think it may be too late?

20090203163113AAmO8mC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How can i help this guy who likes me come out?	I'm 16 and im openly gay. there are virtually no homophobic people at my school so when i came out i didnt realy lose any frieds and am still best friends with the straight guys ive been best friends with since second grade.      So there's this kid who is one grade below me i have know for ever, but we just started hanging out about 5 months ago. he claims that he is straight, but after like 4 days of being friends i started to have my doubts. If any guy, but especially me, bends over or flexes his muscles or does anything that makes him look sexually attractive he makes a big deal of turning away as if he wants everyone to understand he is not checking a guy out. If i change my shirt, or my pants but keep my underwear on, he literally closes his eyes till im done.       Despite all this, every once in a wile he'll want to wrestle (i wrestle with alot of straight friends with no sexual motives behind it) but when he does finds way to practically grind on me, put his hands in all kinds of places, and get my hands to end up on him. when we finish he like gazes into my eyes like he really wants to kiss me but is stopping himself.       I am pretty positive he is gay, and i am pretty positive he likes me. lately, i've started to have feelings for him too. I know if he came out we could be happy together, but i also know from experience that you cannot force someone to come out, they must do it on their own.      So i guess im not looking to help him come out, im looking to speed up his decision to come out so we can hook up already lol.

However, I still believe in Mary's intercessory powers. I also believe that she is the Mother of God.    And Protestants view of salvation seems Biblical.

20090203165211AAxqJie	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do i handle someone unintentionally insulting me?	So, I work with an older lady..older than me anyway, and this is the second or third time she has insulted me.  And I know she doesn't realize it.  We get along and we are friendly and have lunch at the same table everyday, and so on and so forth.  So anyway, today she is talking about someone else and describing them to us and she said..oh she's a big girl..she's even bigger than (me).  Now, I'm not a huge person by any means, but maybe to her I am.  Regardless of how big anyone is, this is the second or third reference she has made about my weight and not quietly either.  Maybe to her it's not a big issue, I don't know..but it's starting to tick me off.  I don't say anything when she says it, I just stare at her incredulously.  How do I deal with this?  Should I say something if it's bothering me this much??  This has been urking me all day.  Thanks for the help!

20090203165302AAkDP6S	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Would you like to live in a multilingual area? Why or why not?	I keep reading about people who oppose learning foreign languages; they start complaining about how this is America and that people should speak English. Others say that they don't want to be forced to speak Spanish, or any other language, or be exposed to anything other than English in day to day life. Others want English to be the only official language. I find it rather intriguing. It's very lively to have all these languages surround you, it shows how interconnected the world is, and it gives you a little exposure to other parts of the world in your day to day life. I have an affinity for languages, but why are people so harsh!? What is so bad with a language other than English? So my question is, would you support languages, or not? Why or why not? Please try to be civilized.   The most insightful answer will be chosen as best.

But I am really in need of some advice as I have no one else to turn to. Can you sense anything about my current relationship and love life? If so, can you please advise me whether or not I am in love or just confused? We have been together for over 2 years, and I have always contemplated my relationship...

20090202112615AAIhQ8T	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Divorce - would you comdemn me for this?	My husband of almost 3 years now has cheated on me with 3 different women. The first time he left me and our daughter alone in a house with no means of support. No food, money etc. We filed for divorce but a few months later, when I actually got back on my feet with a new job, etc. he wanted me back. I gave him another chance because I felt it was right for our family and maybe if he changed we could have that love - plus I took vows to him and don't agree you should just call it quits.      2nd and 3rd girl I found out about them around the same time. He got one pregnant and she aborted the baby after talking to me and found out we were still married. Both these 2 girls knew me personally so it was very difficult.      He moved out of state and we were set to get divorced again but last summer he told me he was very sorry again and started going to church and wanted another chance. I kinda gave him another chance, but I said I WOULD NOT change my life and uproot me and my kid for him again because he had screwed us over in the past. I said I'd give him 4 years (his time left in the Marines) to "prove himself" and then we'd talk.      On my birthday in January he told me he was through (with no apparent reason - but I suspect cheating again) and I haven't spoken to him since.      I think we are done with all the drama and just want closure. Is this an acceptable reason to divorce in your eyes?       The whole time I was faithful and loving, yet untrusting because of what had happened. BUT I was a good wife, better than I should have been to him as he was a dog.      Would God find this acceptable in your eyes? What would you have done different if anything to try to save your marriage?

20090202082027AAgwWXD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are some Christians so obsessed with punishment?	For example:      Whenever I claim that a loving God would base our salvation on works, rather than faith (thus sending 66% of the world to hell), they claim that no amount of works could "pay for" our sins, and that we need to be punished for those sins, by everlasting torment of course.      Does that sound like a loving God? To send us to infinte punishment off finite sins? Wouldn't the default location for a loving God be heaven, where only the extremely evil people would "earn" hell? Why would a loving God send us to hell by default, where we could only "earn" heaven by believing in Him? And thus creating a problem where people are born into a non-Christian household, and have a MUCH less chance at being a Christian than others?      Or, for instance, abortion. I have asked the question many times: What would you rather? Rare and legal abortion, or common but illegal? And guess what the answer is? Common but illegal! They would rather punish the people who get abortions than save the lives of the babies in question!      So why the obsession with punishment?

20090203171145AAR5zyM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Anyone feel as if the atheist’s faith in the tenets of evolution mirrors the mindset of medieval Catholics?	I’ve been monitoring the Yahoo Answers atheist community for a couple of days now, and it seems their most common response to anyone who refutes evolution is, “You must be an ignorant fundamentalist for questioning my superior scientific understanding. You’re better off dead for not seeing the logic of it all.”        The cell is not what we once thought it to be. Why not “evolve” our scientific approach?    By the way, I don’t believe in creationism for those hankering to call me an “ignorant Christian.”   I see the reasoning and merit of today’s scientific theories and tend to agree with them. I just feel we will continue to learn more down the line and it’s best to keep an open mind.    I apologize in advance if I insulted more moderate atheists who are sick and tired of people cramming salvation down their throats.    I just don’t see the need for everyone to be so self-assured of their positions when history has shown us over and over again that we know jack.

20090203171734AAHwinn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT: do you like my story?	Preview: Gays/Lesbians ect. are so misunderstood. Why should people be judged on their sexuality? Some people would say because its wrong and straight up nasty for a man to kiss a man or a girl to kiss a girl. But when you look at the picture theirs nothing wrong with being gay its natural so get use to it. In this story you are going to learn a boy learns a lesson and i think you will to.         Misunderstood:      chapter 1:   Standing outside was a boy named Jason. Jason had problems through out his whole life. He felt as if he was keeping a dirty little secret for so long. Jason thought to himself,"how can i be gay?' As he was thinking to himself his lttle sister Sarha came outside to see him."Hi big brother!" she shouted jumoing on him. Hugging his little sister he thought would she mind. "Hey Sarha would you mind if i was gay?" he asked shuddering as he spoke. His sister smiled. " I will love still love you brother, your not different so I dont care." Jason smiled. "Hey come on lets eat." Sarha's smile faded. she began to look sick. Jason grinned. "How about some Mcicky D's?" Sarha 's smile returned. "Yay!" she yelled running to get her coat and heading towards the car.      Tell me what you think i posted an earlier question about it being wierd and its only the first page of the chapter(sorry couldnt fit it all really.

His life was humble, lowly.  He lived so we can have peace.    When Jesus was taken by the high priest, peter cut off his servants ear.  Jesus told Peter to put away his sword, and he immediately healed the ear.    Why are we "taking the sword out?"  Why is it necessary to be angry?    For me, being at peace and treating others with love is a much better way to show that I love jesus and am trying to be like him.

20090202102700AAOGHAM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What evidence is there that Jesus ever visited America?	So I went to a Mormon church with some friends yesterday, which was tonnes of fun (srsly, such a great day; everyone was so friendly). During the service, they had a part where anybody could go up to the stand and exclaim their faith (can't remember what it's called), and there was one man who really caught my attention.      He talked about this television show called Around The World in 80 Faiths. I actually intended to watch this, but I fell asleep in the bath (as I so often do) and missed it. However, he pointed out a certain section of the show covering the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints, in which he was apparently not pleased.       The man who presented the show had apparently said to some Mormons: "You are aware that there isn't a shred of evidence that Jesus ever visited America, aren't you?" The man at the stand apparently found this preposterous. He stated to us, "There is mountains of evidence that Jesus visited America, both archaeological and--" and this point he cut himself off and began another sentence. It was that sentence that interested me.      As far as I'm aware, there is barely any (verging on no) evidence that Jesus existed at all, let alone that he visited America.      So what is the "mountain of evidence" that he visited America? Or was that nonsense?

20090202110843AAi4huL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists- Why Spend All Day Talking About God's Nonexistence?	First of all, I have total respect for your beliefs. I believe in God, and I know the atheists generally disagree. That is totally fine. I have friends of different faiths in my personal life as well. So please don't take this as offensive. I don't mean it in that way at all. I seriously want to know the answer to this.      But what I really don't understand is why do {SOME-not all} atheists get on here all day to talk about the one thing they say doesn't exist? I mean, I don't believe in many things (BigFoot for example), but I certainly don't go on a forum and post all day and put an incredible amount of energy into trying to convice others he doesn't exist.      I suspect some of you may say something like, "To educate others about it." But isn't that what religious people do? They form a belief, gather evidence, and educate others about it??      So what is the difference between an atheist and a religious person. Don't they both have a particular belief, and spend time promoting and sharing that belief with others? Neither can prove his or her point is the right one.      Again, please don't take offense. I don't mean "ALL ATHEISTS" as I know many of you are very respectful and kind on here. I mean the ones who really bash others and insult them.      [Again, the question is, If you don't believe in God, why all the energy in promoting this belief??]      Also, to be fair, I know atheists aren't the only ones who do this. All people of different faiths do. But if you reject faith in general, why do some of you do it?      Thanks in advance for your honesty. 10 points to the best!!

It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.      -Adolf Hitler, in a speech on 12 April 1922 (Norman H. Baynes, ed. The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922-August 1939, Vol. 1 of 2, pp. 19-20, Oxford University Press, 1942)

If anyone needs translation with Spanish or Italian feel free to ask me :)   Begins:    narrator—There can be a lot of interesting people at flea markets. This is what could possibly happen….      Serena: $34.50!   Heba: No this _______ costs way more than that!    Serena: $50.00 is too much! I can get a cheaper deal in China.   Heba: Well, this costs more because this is not made in China!   Serena: Fine. Let me inspect its quality…   Heba: Fine.   Serena: This is made in China!      Bickering continues…      Narrator—now enters Jennifer, a ordinary, every day girl who just wishes to find a nice bargain…       Jennifer:  YEA! WHAT? THAT IS SO NOT TRUE! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NO WAY! I HATE SHORT GUYS! WHEN I WEAR HIGH HEELS I DON’T WANT TO HAVE TO LOOK DOWN ON THEM.      Phone mutters       Jennifer: EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!   Serena (in Chinese): acts annoyed and screams something in Chinese. Jennifer ignores.      Narrator—…and a guy called Stephan.      Stephan (in a very nasally voice): I need to find a calculator because I was doing mutli-variable calculus other the day and mine broke! I was on the verge of a scientific breakthrough too!      Stephan approaches Heba’s stall.      Stephan: Madame. Um. Do you happen to have a calculator?   Heba: Who do you think I look like? First an Asian lady comes asking for antique soy sauce and then argues with me over the price of _________. This is a flea market for goodness sake!      Asian lady notices Stephan.   Serena: You are a goooood child because you do math. I will help you.   Serena then draws Stephan a hand drawn map to the stall of the calculators.   Serena: My friends don’t think I drive that well, but here are the directions.    Stephan: Thank you.      Stephan walks around Ms.Owen’s room in search of the stall but drops his glasses in the process. When he finds his glasses again, he sees a scary, old witch lady.      Witch (in scraggly voice):  My blueberry muffin, you seem to be in need of some help.   Stephan (a little scared): No thank you. I am just fine.    Stephan is about to go but the witch stops him.   Witch: My magical fortune-telling orb has told me that you are in search for a rectangular object!   Stephan: Yes!   Witch: A calculator!   Stephan: Yes! Do you have one to sell?   Witch: No.    BUT I have this lovely, delicious perfume!    Stephan: Ummm. No thank you. I’m allergic to cologne.       The witch ignores Stephan and grabs him and sprays the love potion on him. Stephan immediately transforms into a French player. ;)      Stephan: En haha! I am the king of love!   Stephan looks around the room and spots Cindy. He goes over to her and says something extremely creepy, but before she can overreact too much, Stephan spots Jennifer on the phone at Heba’s stall and stalks toward her.      Stephan: Mademoiselle, can I have directions?   Jennifer (looks annoyed at being interrupted): What! To where?   Stephan: To your heart, lovely!   Jennifer: Oh my gosh—who says stuff like that any more?    (to the person in the phone): This creepy French stalker guy is trying to hit on me!   Stephan: Are you tired?   Jennifer: Wait—I’m not even going to answer that.   Stephan: Because you have been running around my mind all day!    Jennifer: I just met you! Plus, you are too short!   Stephan: But baby, let me prove my love to you!   Jennifer: Fine. To prove your love, go buy me  __________ . Jennifer points to the item that the Chinese lady and Heba were arguing over in the beginning.    Stephan: Yes, my honey bun! As Stephan turns to get the item, Jennifer runs away. However, as Stephan walks toward the item, the Chinese lady approaches it also. However, Stephan grabs the item before Serena and heads to the cashier (Heba) to make his payment. The annoyed Chinese lady gets in line before Stephan.   Serena: You baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad child! Don’t respect lady! Don’t respect elder! Don’t respect person who helped you!    Heba: I thought you didn’t want it (the item).   Serena: I will make you a new offer: $35.00.   Stephan now turns around.    Stephan: Has anyone ever told you that you look like Chun Li? You know, that girl from Street Fighter 2?   Serena (highly annoyed): You little squished dumpling, I will fight you!    Serpent fang! Chinese lady does gouge eyes.   Monkey claw! Chinese lady hits Stephan with a bag and Stephan passes out.      Narrator:  As you can see, flea markets can be very…um…dangerous places.      Witch: Ohhhhhhhhh! I gave him the Parisian Pimpin Potion! I was going to give him the one for finding directions!
20090202145708AAiAqkR	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Facebok and Sexuality?	I find facebook extremely limited and oppressive in many ways. My number one issue is the "interested in" section of Basic Info. It really beats around the bush, with only 3 options: women, men, or women and men. First of all, I think that there should be an open box where you can write your sexuality the way that you want it expressed. Gay, Lesbian, Bi, Queer, or Interested In _____. Does anyone agree with me? And how would I go about suggesting this to the administration?

She's pretty talented and displays a warm and friendly side.  But when you see her, she's just incredibly shy and quiet.      Why do you think she's so shy if she has all of these positive attributes? What would u think when you saw her in person?

Last Christmas I couldn't help but notice all of the children haughtily discussing what their parents are going to get them for Christmas, or what they would like to get for Christmas.  I was no different when I was a child, but now it just doesn't seem right.        Why are parents teaching their children that the best thing to look forward to during Christmas is receiving gifts?  Is the entire meaning of Christmas lost to them?        As a child, did you really care as much about the meaning behind Christmas as  you cared about receiving gifts?

And these are people who I have known for years, so don't bother trying to say that "these are people who aren't your friends" and such. Anyway, I hate ketchup. Just the thought of it makes me gag. So at lunch last week, a friend bought me a chicken patty sandwich. I never thought of checking, so I took a bite out of it. Inside was...you guessed it...ketchup. I started coughing, gagging and spitting and retching and almost threw up. It was really embarrassing cause I was like drooling and trying to spit up it was front of a bunch of cute girls....should I be embarrassed?

20090202152740AAPLkxe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What does this dream mean?	I am recently widowed. I had a couple of dreams about being in a church. I am looking for my husband in these dreams. I asked a stranger where he was. I was told he is around somewhere.I floated all around the church seeking him out after no success I decided to sit in a row of pu's with my children beside me.There were others sittinng in the rows beside us and behind us. The whole center of the church was brightly lit with nobody sitting in the pu's. I believe in God and Christ sacrificing himself for me but I don't attend church.   I study the bible at home everyday and read books on spiritualality. Why would I dream this?      I had a second dream about a young blonde woman. She spoke but I can't remember what she said. This girl appeared to be in her 20's. She was very bright and angellic with a bright white face and bluish eyes. I followed this woman inside an apartment i heard her speak but I just don't remember the words we exchanged.      A third dream I had was another church dream where it was centered on taking my 13 year old son to bible school to watch bible story movies. After we got up to leave I saw this autum colored orangeish vine start to grow along the hall way wall of the church. The vine developed some type of golden orange berries that turned into some unrecognizable plant or fruit. When we walked out of the church A teenager from our old neighborhood picked us up in his old rusty colored truck to bring us home from church. This teenage boy is know to be on the wrong side of the law. I can't imagine why he would be picking us up from church.

I was able to switch to a harder Japanese class that has two teachers but this class is really hard cause the teacher talks only in Japanese and she doesn't write stuff in the blackboard T_T so It was hard for me to understand her.      Anyway.. I think KANA in the end of the sentence is like "I wonder"   for example: "Ashita wa shiken ga musukashii kana" "I wonder if tomorrow's test is going to be difficult" But I'm not sure if I'm correct, can anyone explain the usage of Kana?    I heard my teaching saying "Shiken musukashii kana" <- there is no particles so what is the differences between the long one and the short one? can Kana be added in a long sentence or just casual sentences?       and she was saying that only girls use "わ” in a sentence but I don't get what she means by that T__T can anyone explain?   for example (I wrote this as I was hearing my teacher speaking in japanese) "わよのんです”   What does that mean?

20090202154726AA7rhh5	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does this make me a pedophile?	OK, My brother thinks I am weird because I have this big interest in working around kids. At church there are these 3 boys who have it pretty bad. The 4 year old gets all the attention from the dad, while the others don't. I at the moment, am also having it pretty bad with work and such, so I cant be a 100% active person in their lives. So on Sundays I spend time with them at church when I get the chance. Not just that It might just be a small talk or I might sit there with the 4 year old, while he colors his coloring book.The oldest has it even worst. He is currently in the hospital, recovereing from a nervous breakdown, and still has suicidal thoughts. I have made a promise to my self, that even if it takes years I am gonna stop him from doing anything like that, and I am gonna try to be a part in the lives. I don't care about my life, but only theirs. I know the things I do seem pedophilia, but really that's not what I am trying to do. I would never harm a child like that, I would rather die. So do the things I do make me a pedophile? and is it right for me to step up for these boys, even if its a small part?

In the uk its the deepest snow we have had for 20years (so before i was born) we only usually get a thin layer of snow for a day a year.      so i was wondering should i spend the day at college which involves hours walking to college then cramped inside a boring classroom for 6 hours then hours walking home in the snow and by the time i get home its too dark to have fun in the snow.       or should i take the day off and build snowmen and have snowball fights.      Because we probably won't see snow like this for another 10-20 years and by that time i will be too old to do anything fun...      What do you guys think i should do?

If someone told you that you were going to hell regardless if you believe that it's real or it's just an illusion because in order to be put in prison or jail you don't really have to believe that one exist but do something against the law and you would end up in there. Everyone does something against the supreme law of the Universe which is our contentious and Bible and so everyone deserves punishment in hell. However there is a way out and it's through Jesus.       Does this affect you in any way and are you willing to except the way out through Jesus from this eternal punishment that every person deserves?

Okay...so here is some details....I am 14 turning 15 and I have this friend she is only about a month or two younger than I am and she just recently revealed to me that she is bisexual...I was kind of shocked but found it awesome and I liked the idea because she was closest to me out of everyone in here life and she has not even known me for a year yet....anyway, I thought awesome, only I know, and I feel special/important.....Well I don't really remember how this next part happened but we agreed to go out........that lasted about two weeks..I ended it because it wasn't my thing....but the weekend I ended it I still remembered she wanted her first kiss to be with me....so we kissed.....lots....and that was that.....she was mad at me and very hurt for awhile after that...but she got over it and then......something happened....or continued to happen...every time she would sleep over things would happen .....things other than kissing...you get it.....we enjoyed it....because we both have very strong feelings for each other.....but then I felt bad because in reality ( we still weren't going out) we had just basically become friends with benefits.....(her words...she didn't mind though XD ) Well when winter break came....I went swimming with some of my friends....one of which I just found out was bi as well as my other friend.....so I thought to set them up...because I felt really bad that I had hurt her..........So now everyone was happy.....so I thought.....Has anyone heard of the saying "You want what you can't have?" Well that's me........I guess it only took me to see her in someone else's arms.....She has kissed this other person twice so far.....it hurts me so badly...she knows and feels terrible for hurting me.....which I feel even worse for....now she told me two nights ago that she is going to break up with her gf....(i made them swear not to because of me....I don't want them to break up because of me being a dork) Anyway....she told me that today is the day she was going to carefully break it off with her girlfriend.....but I don't know if she did because I was sick today....And I need them to......HELP?!?............................ a few more things..........One she told she loved about two days ago......She told she always will even if we are fighting..........and she says she doesn't click with her girl...and..........yeah...that's basically all I can remember at the moment..........see my dilema?

I have this girlfriend, and my parents still have no idea that I'm into girls. Well now that i come to think of it, whenever we're out they even point out girls to me like "Oh, she's pretty, don't you think?" or "Do you think that girl is cute?" But i didn't give them hints, so i don't know. And i never bring home my girlfriends, as much. But now, i almost can't resist. I want her over all the time, we wanna go out and leave the house. But MY parents are I'm pretty sure "clueless", to me anyway. So i don't know what kind of excuse i would have for her being over like everyday and hanging out all the time. Because just with my best friends, they aren't over as much as she is or will be.  And i don't know how i would get away with being intimate around my parents without them knowing. Also, her mom doesn't except her sexuality. She doesn't want her to have a girlfriend or to be "different" which kind of upsets me. so her mom doesn't know we're dating, if she did she would do whatever she could to keep her away from me and  we didn't want to risk that.    Could i get away with this? Or should i just tell them, what do i have to loose, right?

Obviously i'm not dumb enough to buy woman shoes when i know for sure i was in the mens section and bought them in men sizes. I just looked at her and didnt respond and just put my headphones back in. How should i respond to people like this? Did i respond to her the right way? I also get alot of people who say singing is for girls and they make fun of me for going to lessons on the nights there are dances. They haven't even heard me sing either. Should i ignore them and not react or respond to them ?

20090202163835AAYmRua	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ex Christians, Do You Ever Tire Of Christians Insisting That You Were Never Saved?	Isn’t it ironic that we ex-Christians know the Bible better than most Christians?  Isn’t it further ironic that it was a “more complete” knowledge of Christianity that drove us away?      I remember claiming that my faith was my life.  That nothing could separate me from the love of God…      But isn’t it funny how belief works?        You can actually learn things about your belief that cause it to change completely!      i.e., If I believed that Santa Claus were real, even though I really, really believed it- and even though I had some historical evidence for Santa and the testimony of millions as to his existence….      I would be wrong.   But that doesn’t mean that I was never a believer does it?  I truly was, but when I became a man – I put away childish things.  I learned that there comes a time when one must replace magic and pretend for reality and truth.      Ex-Christians, have you noticed a paradigm shift – in your lifetime - that seems to value reason and logic and reality more than pretend things?      What are the dynamics that contribute to this?      Do you suppose it’s something more than the Christian answer, “IN THE END THERE WILL COME A GREAT FALLING AWAY….”  and “there will come deceivers…”  and “if it were possible, even the very elect will be deceived…” and “the wisdom of men is foolishness to the Lord…”      “You were never saved!”      I suppose that this is one of those things that Christians MUST say, in order to present an explanation for the apparent weakness of God’s presence in a former believer’s life.      OF COURSE, there are enough scriptures to provide an alternative answer (which is the case, curiously, for many various doctrines) such as:      “Well, you may have been saved, but you ‘turned from the faith’” or “You were deceived” or “You are still saved, because Jesus never let you go, but you are just in a faith crises, because once you know God, you can never turn away…”      Of course, we ex-Christians know that each of these is untrue.  Once you have been freed from the bondage to a God slavemaster, the inexpressible liberty is something undeniable.  It is the greatest feeling in the World to be true.

20090202115108AAFHtZK	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Question About The Movie 'Prayers For Bobby' And Current Western Culture?	If you seen the movie 'Prayers For Bobby' I want to know what you think about this. Bobby in the movie was very thin, probably 15-20 lb. underweight, but at the end of the movie they showed a picture of the real Bobby, and he was a lot more filled out, not like fat or anything, but like more muscular and not thin at all.      But you know how women in Hollywood are expected to be really thin, and they've gotten thinner in recent years. Is the same thing happening with men or boys, because I've noticed male models on the runways have gotten thinner in the past few years.       Or is it they just want to portray young gay men as really thin? I know there may be no connection, and maybe they just wanted to hire the guy for the role and he happened to be really thin. But still, if they wanted to portray Bobby realistically I think they would hire an actor that more closely resembled his body type. Do you think they hired a very thin guy on purpose?      Do you think the current trend in western culture is for gay men to be really thin?

20090202160407AA2Uh4I	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why do some people make a such a big deal about a child's name when the child isn't even theirs?	A lot of people think my sisters and I have strange names. My name is Emerubya (a combination of Emerald and Ruby) and my sisters' names are Hanikkia (combination of Hannah, Nikki and Keke), Kazileya, Celebi, Kay and Key. None of us have any problems with our names. Four of those names are made up (strangely enough, one also happens to be the name of something called a pokemon), but we still love them. We get sick of hearing people say, "You'll have to change your names when you get old enough (Hanikkia and Kazileya are already old enough). I mean I know everyone gets made fun of for something, but just for a name seems ridiculous to me. And most of the people who say those kinds of things to my sisters and I are adults, which is kind of shocking, considering adults are viewed as more mature than children and teens.

He occasionally likes to make white jokes. Idk if it's just a guy thing or if he really is a lil racist. Last night we were at a super bowl party, and the host had a dog, and the dog walked right up to my friend and let him pet it. Then I called it, and the dog looked at me, ignored me and walked away. I mumbled, "awww.She hates me." My friend said, "yes,she hates you...cuz you're white." I'd had enough of his white jokes in the last year. So I said, "then how come she came to you?" and he replied, "cuz I'm mexican." "Really? What's your dad?" He looked around like he was trying to pull an answer out of the air [besides the word white], "ummm...caucasian?" "then the dog still shouldn't have liked you.She just hates me cuz she knows how many animals I've killed." He laughed, "no....she doesn't hate you.lol." So...was I realy mean in my response? I didn't mean to be. I just don't like his white jokes.

I know that bastante means "enough" or "sufficient" but I keep hearing it used like demasiado, where I would expect to use "very" in english.      For example:  someone saying the bathroom is bastante pequeno in the small apartment, or saying someone is bastante demasiado.        No one would say the bathroom is "small enough" unless somehow they were talking about trying to fit in a remodeling or something, and this was not the context.        Same for demasiado.  You wouldn't say someone is sufficiently disorganized.  That doesn't make sense.      Can someone help me understand this?

Though the fact that they are all girls too ruin that...

I have told him that this makes me uncomfortable and he backed off.  But now he is giving me presents.        He is worried about me because of some health issues I am going through.

One time he thought I was mad at him and he actually cried! I am so torn.  I have told the other manager who in turn told the owner about the comments and touching but now the presents..... aaarrgghhhhh      help!

Here are the questions again.      1- Do you believe that Rasoolallah (saww) IS Hadhar and Nadhar?   2- Do you believe that Fatima (as) is truthful declared by Allah in Quran?      Quran 3:61] If any one disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full) knowledge Hath come to thee, say: "Come! let us gather together,- our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: Then let us earnestly pray, and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!"

20090202115453AAWhqbj	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Muslims...What do you think I should do?	Me and my sister-in-law have noticed a change in my brother's character and we both didn't know the other had felt that way until about an hour ago when we spoke on the phone.       He used to be more of a family man, like he'd help my mum out a lot, take her out. Obviously he annoyed me like a brother should, but still that was normal. Even when he first got married, he'd take his wife out to eat he'd take us all out to the park, get some food. Like he did more back then. Now he's very self-centred and constantly makes promises he doesn't keep.      He's extremely rude as well, like he'd say things that'll make you say "you can't speak to a human being like that" and he'll never apologise for it. I've noticed he is very rude to his wife, and he doesn't realise that if this was any other woman, she would have left him by now. I can't explain in any detail, but he's just become really rude. But he was never like this.       The problem with him is, he doesn't realise he's doing anything wrong, and you can't talk to the guy. Sometimes he won't listen, and sometimes he listens, he'll act like "you're right, I shouldn't do this and that" and then he'll act like that conversation never happened. But I am very shocked by how rude he can be. But I don't think he even knows he's being rude.      Now, I was thinking of writing him an email, coz I never email him and I think he would be quite shocked to see it and pay more attention to it. What do you think I should mention? Like Islamic quotes. Anything you think I should bring up. I already have written some things down that I think are important.       Any ideas?      Thanks in advance.

20090202115843AA2VcNI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My gay best friend recently came out to me......?	im a girl and he is a guy - he told me and a few other close friends that he was gay very recently - 2 days ago. people always suspected that he might possibly be gay, but i never really thought that he was. he is my best friend and i couldnt love him more, but i am finding it very slightly weird....   why is this? i'm not a homophobe at all, and as i said i always knew of the possibility of him being gay. i reacted very well and comforted him as much as possible when he told me, and i do aim to be the best friend possible - i even think our friendship is much much stronger now, but i still think about it all the time and it makes me a bit nervous for some reason!   has this ever happened to you and if so how did you feel/react???   does anyone have any insight as to why i feel like this?    (i am 17, so is he, and we have been friends for about 5 years)
20090202115800AAYjrcY	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Qur'an Alone People, The Billion Dollar Question?	Simply read this, and answer the Question at the bottom.      In Islam, the Qibla(direction of Prayer) is Mecca.  Before being Mecca, it was Jerusalem.  The Qur’an, never mentions Jerusalem as the original Qibla.  Allah SWT says in the Qur’an:      “ Thus we have made You (true Muslims), a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that You be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad) be a witness over you. and we made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which You used to face, Only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e. disobey the Messenger). indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allah guided. and Allah would never make Your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. Your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.” (2:143)      SubhanAllah, Allah was just testing those who obey Muhammad, when he said to pray to Jerusalem.  Its so sad that when the people 1400 years ago learned their lesson, people today still have not learned the lesson.       So the Question is, where in the Qur'an does it say to pray towards Jerusalem?  (hint: it doesn't say it anywhere)      Accept the Qur'an and Accept the Sunnah.  Reject the Sunnah and Reject the Qur'an.

Why do families continue to have kids especially when they can't afford to?  I understand accidents and things like that but so many people that keep having children have no problem going to get on welfare but they never seem to go get other assistance from agencies that deal with birth control, etc.  I can understand families that use the welfare because sometimes you do need a little help because times get tough financial wise and what not.  I'm not referring to those people but the majority of people that apply for assistance are just looking for a hand out.

I know both terms overlap considering many anorexics are perfectionistic themselves, but this is assuming that both are different cases (not all perfectionists are anorexic).      I'm just curious.

I don't have hearts on my i's or anything, but I make my a's like with the hook at the took (like the kind I'm typing now). I make my lowercase r's capital but as small as the rest of my letters.

20090202165244AA95lgM	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is it that people grow to hate people so much?	I was thinking in particular of the russell brand and andrew sachs thing. I have been fighting with people over this for about 6 months. Because ok they did something wrong but they know they did it wrong, and why we all have to judge i dont know. like it's a witchunt or something.    Like the Jade, Shilpa Shetty thing, people behaved worse towards jade than jade did to shilpa. Even though that wasn't good.    In the end what it all leads to, apart from hatred, with things like this is a place where everything is censored. where nothing is a joke. (yes jonathan and russell took it too far, but they still meant it as a joke) i think the real problem is when people MEAN things.     i mean it's ok then to take pictures of jonathan ross's children at halloween it's ok to make them go into hiding. even though andrew sachs is over it. does anyone else feel the same way? there's enough genuine hatred in the world to be hating over stupid things.

Wasn't there a story in the bible in which the husband of a woman died and, according to tradition, the ex-husband's younger brother married the woman in order to take care of her. Then, the brother died, and the woman was taken in by a brother that was younger still.  Somebody then brought up the issue: since the woman was wife of all three brothers on Earth, which brother's wife would she be in Heaven. When this issue was brought up, the person was scorned because he didn't understand the scriptures, for in Heaven the woman would not be the wife of any of the brothers.      Or, something like that....  Anyway where in the bible does it say this, or something similar to this?

I Ever since I was a little girl Ive liked boys.I remember having a crush on a boy in 1st grade.In fact it seems like I always had a crush on some boy.When I was 12 or 13 I went through puberty and started masturbating to pictures of naked men.It always seemed like I was daydreaming about having a boyfriend or marrying an extremely handsome man.I find men attractive and I want to be with a man.   Until about a month ago I was living that life,a normal life for me,a life I loved.   One day A little voice in my head said"your gay".It took me by surprise because Ive never been attracted to a women before.I have been stressing over it for a month,it drives me crazy.I have tried thinking about being with a woman/seeing women naked,but it doesn't do a thing for me.No attraction.   So Im normal right?maybe,but now I have a hard time finding guys attractive again.I still think of guys as sexually attractive, but not as much as I used to.   My question is if I was straight for as long as Ive been alive am i going to stay straight?Is this a phase,does everyone go through sexual confusion?Maybe Im an Asexual?
