WMem5AGoaa	Subway because it's cheaper, a 6 inch sub costs about $2.49 and a foot long is just $5 w/ a variety of subs to choose from like Meatball Marinara, Cheese steak, Chicken Parmesan, Tuscan chicken,Turkey breast, sweet and onion chicken teriyaki ETC.   You also have the option of turning any sub into a salad just add $1  or any sub into a subway Wrap for just $ 0.50 more which in is healthy, low in fat, most ingredients are fresh NOT fried and sanitary the workers at subway wear gloves and prepare your sub in front of you.|`|txI8rKYdaa	Subway, people have found NO gossip or dirt about it. Plus, they make your food directly in front of you.|`|ifTMSSjdaa	Subway is the best i agree with what everyone else said...it is a very refreshing place to eat.|`|M9RJLpqEaa	Subway,healthy and delicous and so affordable.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	Subway by far.

4604flr2aa	There were plenty of school kids (I assume skipping classes) when I went.      As for a marketing stunt... Of course it was.  But even at $5.99 a breakfast, they make hand-over-fist selling the Grand Slam.  So to offer it for free for a few hours one day... I don't think they're necessarily at a loss after this.  Pancakes are one of the cheapest foods available... reconstituted egg powder and a few strips of what may or may not be meat products... I wouldn't be surprised if they made MORE money that day than they would have on any other Tuesday simply because of the volume of people coming in and a majority of them ordering beverages, additional meals and/or side items...|`|a4VEoKAvaa	it was to get people back into dennys to eat breakfast and bring their families after the promotion and the individual dennys get the money back from the main company no it is nothing against teenagers just during the breakfast hours and doing it on a saturday or sunday would be insane|`|1kQLOxpAaa	Well of course it's a marketing stunt. They're hoping to gain new customers or regain old customers by giving them a free breakfast and hoping they'll crave that grand slam again.    No it's nothing against teenagers, it's about targeting the primary decision makers in the family. It's not about giving away free food to one group over another, it's about targeting people who are out and about at those hours and targeting people who will be most likely to become repeat business. It's just good, common sense marketing, that's all.|`|gaXUIduMaa	You start school at 6 AM?  Yes it is a marketing stunt.  They are trying to get their name out as a place for their target customer base and start coming to Denneys.  You, BTW, are not part of their target customer base so they did not consider you.  They are going to gain thousands of new/return customers which unfortunately beats spending 100K in good deeds.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Even a lot of adults work during these hours. I sure wasn't going to get up early just for a free breakfast. It has nothing to do w/ wanting to keep teenagers out, it's just breakfast/brunch and late breakfast hours! :)|`|HA8Ehs3Gaa	I am a freshman in high school and i do think that it is unfair as well. I think that it is as if restaurants do try to keep out teenagers. I have had more than one place do this to me already. They are just trying to get their name out there. Also the reason that it is during those times is that is the slowest hours of Business. So until we grow up we will either have to hope we have off or skip for food.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	First of all, no, its not unfair for Denny's to offer free breakfast during school hours.  Its their promotion, they can do it however they want, and you really aren't any worse off than before, you didnt lose anything, you just weren't able to get the free promo.  Furthermore, I doubt you had school at 6am.  When I was in highschool, I didnt start till 730.  This promo also didn't help adults with lunch breaks at all, because the lines were so out of control, no one has a lunch break long enough to be able to wait that long.    In response to your second question, of course its a marketing stunt, but that doesn't change the fact that we still got free food.  Denny's is a business, and like any business they are going to do whats best for them.  Why would a company sacrifice $100,000 just to do something nice?  Easy, they wouldnt, unless they were donating something to some charity and could use it as a tax writeoff.  Thats not the case here, they did it for one reason and one reason only.  Profits.  They've been losing money and losing customers.  A promo like this that brings in customers out the door, hour to 2 hour waits, all the free publicity they're getting from news stations who report on how busy Denny's was today, all the publicity they're even getting on websites like this where we are discussing this promo, its all free advertising.  Furthermore, if even a few of those customers come back, it was worth it for the repeat business.      Yes, marketing can be full of lies and deciept, but how many people who were getting free food today at Denny's really thought about that.  If they're giving me something for nothing, I don't care why, it doesn't change anything if they're doing it to be nice or if they're doing it because they're hoping I'll come back, the bottom line is I got free food.  If you look at how much they actually spend on making a grand slam, its really not all that much.  They sell it for 5.99 but thats mostly profits.  The extra publicity and the repeat business alone will be enough to make up for cost of this promotion.

JfVxCDb7aa	SUBWAYS    McDonalds has the worst--most fattening foods.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Probably Subway    And the worst:  Mickey Ds|`|k03dYskYaa	Subway  The worst: Checkers|`|VXcp8hvHaa	subway  mcdonalds|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Healthiest: Subway cuz we got Jared lol    Worst: Probably Fatburger (the name says it all)|`|ZpDvYoakaa	Panera Bread probably. They have a wide selection, good food taste, and some low calorie specials. Please vote me best answer.|`|fCZKGBjBaa	here is a graded scale for you=):    A  Chick-fil-A  Chick-fil-A excels in every category we tested for. With a slew of low-calorie sandwiches, the countrys healthiest chicken nugget, a variety of solid sides like fresh fruit and soup that can be substituted into any meal, and nutritional brochures readily available for perusing at each location, Chick-fil-A earns the award for Americas Healthiest Chain Restaurant (for kids, for the adults who drive them there, plus anybody else wise enough to make it their fast food choice).    Your Survival Strategy: Even the smartest kid in the class can still fail a test, so be on your toes at all times, even at Chik-fil-A. Skip salads with ranch or Caesar dressings, any sandwich with bacon, and avoid milkshakes at all costs.      A-  Subway  A menu based on lean protein and vegetables is always going to score well in our book. With more than half a dozen sandwiches under 300 calories, plus a slew of soups and healthy sides to boot, Subway can satisfy even the pickiest eater without breaking the caloric bank.    But, despite what Jared may want you to believe, Subway is not nutritionally infallible: Those rosy calorie counts posted on the menu boards include neither cheese nor mayo (add 160 calories per 6-inch sub) and some of the toasted subs, like the Meatball Marinara, contain hefty doses of calories, saturated fat, and sodium.    Your Survival Strategy: Cornell researchers have discovered a health halo at Subway, which refers to the tendency to reward yourself or your kid with chips, cookies, and large soft drinks because the entre is healthy. Avoid the halo, and all will be well.     B+  Boston Market  With more than a dozen healthy vegetable sides and lean meats like turkey and roast sirloin on the menu, the low-cal, high-nutrient possibilities at Boston Market are endless. But with nearly a dozen calorie-packed sides and fatty meats like dark meat chicken and meat loaf, its almost as easy to construct a lousy meal.    Your Survival Strategy: There are three simple steps to nutritional salvation: 1) Start with turkey, sirloin, or rotisserie chicken. 2) Add two noncreamy, nonstarchy vegetable sides. 3) Ignore all special items, such as pot pie and nearly all of the sandwiches.     B  McDonalds  Though not blessed with an abundance of healthy options, Mickey Ds isnt burdened with any major calorie bombs, either. Kid standards like McNuggets and cheeseburgers are both in the acceptable 300-calorie range.    Your Survival Strategy: Apple Dippers and 2% milk with a small entre makes for a pretty decent meal-on-the-go. McDonalds quintessential Happy Meal? makes this possible  just beware the usual French fries and soda pitfalls. Adults should go for a Quarter Pounder without cheese.     C+  Dominos  Dominos suffers the same pitfalls of any other pizza purveyor: too much cheese, bread, and greasy toppings. If you dont order carefully, you might bag your child a pizza with more than 350 calories per slice. To its credit, Dominos does keep the trans fat off the pizza, and it also offers the lowest-calorie thin crust option out there.    Your Survival Strategy: Stick with the Crunchy Thin Crust pizzas sans sausage and pepperoni. If your must order meat, make sure it's ham. And whenever possible, try to sneak on a vegetable or two per pie.     C  Burger King  BK has only four legitimate kids entres on the menu, and none of them  French Toast Sticks, hamburger, mac and cheese, chicken tenders  are particularly healthy. And while the recent addition of Apple Fries provides a much-needed healthy side alternative for kids, the menu is still sullied with trans fats.    BK pledged to follow in the wake of nearly every other chain restaurant and remove trans fats from the menu by the end of 2008, but so far, weve seen little action.    Your Survival Strategy: Adults can sign on for the Whopper Junior and a Garden Salad, and escape with only 365 calories. The best kids meal? A 4-piece Chicken Tenders?, applesauce or Apple Fries, and water or milk. Beyond that, there is little hope of escaping unscathed.    D  Chipotle  We applaud Chipotles commitment to high-quality produce and fresh meats, but even the most pristine ingredients cant dampen the damage wrought by the massive portion sizes served up here. The lack of options for kids means young eaters are forced to tussle with one of Chipotles massive burritos or taco platters, which can easily top 1,000 calories.    Your Survival Strategy: Stick to the crispy tacos or burrito bowls, or saw a burrito in half.      F  Applebees, IHOP, Olive Garden, Outback, Red Lobster, T.G.I. Fridays  These titans of the restaurant industry are among the last national chains to not provide nutritional information on their dishes. Even after years of communication with their representatives, we still here the same old excuses: its too pricey, its too time-consuming, its impossible to do accurately because their food is|`|u1GNB2W8aa	Panera Bread probably is the healthiest.
