20090223112901AAxZ5mi	Pets;Dogs	Please help having trouble with my dog and her eating?	When i got her she wanted table food. But she would eat her dog food that the previous owners sent her. So she would eat the dog food they sent her but she would come in the kitchen when we would cook and just sit there until i am done cooking. Or if she was outside while we were cooking she would come in while we were eating and want our food. So i bought the canned dog food and she ate that really good. Then when we ran out of that i bought her dry dog food ( which is what the original owners sent and the canned is more expensive than dry dog food ) and it's a different brand and she will not touch it. And she went two days with out eating and I fed her weiners just to put something on her stomach. And now she will not eat the dry dog food that i bought. Not even when she is hungry. When i cook she will stand in the kitchen hoping to get something. But we keep her dog bowl full with dog food and she will not touch it. So how do i get her to eat dog food again...Thanks in advance

I have been trying to formulate recipes that have the right amount of vitamins and minerals, but, like a puzzle, it's complicated, trying to get the right amount of everything.  I know that you're supposed to add supplements if you're giving your dog homemade food.        We currently feed our dog Science Diet,and then give him a homemade meal.  But I am worried that he's not getting all the nutrients in it.  However, people have said that the dog food has extra vitamins and minerals, so he shouldn't be lacking.  But if, for example, the homemade food has too much phosphorous and little calcium, I don't want him to end up with a deficiency.  Is it true that the dog food would be enough, although it's' being replaced once a day with another food?      And, instead of making from scratch, can't you just buy a can of Chef Boyardee and give that?  For example, macaroni and cheese, excellent source of protein, rich in calcium.  Or are there problems with this?      Thanks for any help.

20090223113255AAkvpIG	Pets;Birds	Two days ago, I bought a Budgie. Seeing signs of rapid breathing. Could it be anxity?	I have a beautiful budgie that I bought two days ago. He's a male of about a year or year and a half. When I brought him home, I trimmed his wings, and put him in his cage. Since he's been here, I see rapid breathing. Breathing that's so rapid it bob's his little tail. However, he doesn't droop his wings, he's not panting with his beak open, he isn't chirping much, but is eating a bit now, but not on a regular basis as a bird should.      Could it merely be anxity of his new surrounding? Is it something that I should be really concerned about and take him to the vet? I'm a bird owner of parrot's and cockatiels and this is my first budgie, so I wasn't for sure if this is normal behavior for those species.      Any information would be helpful.

20090223113727AAGUBPI	Pets;Dogs	My dog pees every hour, it is not a UTI. What could it be?	My 7 month old Yorkie mix pees every hour, sometimes more. She will go outside when we take her, but if we try to take her every hour and 15 min, she will go in the house. When we got her at 9 weeks old, she had a UTI and had medication and it was cleared up. Recently within the month, We had another urinalysis done and there was no bacteria, but he did say the urine was dark. We also had a urine culture done, that also came back normal. The vet wants to do a blood test to make sure it is not a kidney problem. I want to know if this is a training issue or a medical one. I have already spent $100 on the urine tests. The vet doesn't seem to have any idea what it is and seems to just order more tests and hopes he stumbles upon the answer, but I don't have the money for that. Anyone have a similar problem?
20090223113735AAuaHGB	Pets;Birds	I'm getting a household pet bird for my birthday. which type would you reccomend?	I'm turning fourteen in eight days, and I'm going to convince my parents to get me a bird. I've always wanted one, but I'm not sure which breed would be best for me .   I'm looking for something   - relatively small, but not as small as a finch   - somewhat cheap ; none of the $200 parrots   - not excessively noisy ; during the day it can be as loud as it wants, i'll be at school. but at night, i need it to be quiet. putting a blanket over the cage hushes them up doesn't it?   - friendly. i'd rather not get a mean bird that bites and squawks at me   - something i could find at a local petstore like Petsmart      Prices would also help a lot ! :)

20090223115103AAxBplQ	Pets;Dogs	A question and a thank you regurding my Aussie Shep.?	I have asked several questions over the last few months about my Aussie.  She was a TOTAL pain in my butt and I could not control her.  I was told to treat her like a 3 yr old and she would get better.  Needless to say it worked.  She stopped biting, she stopped trying to herd the kids and she is now such a love.  She actully cares about what we think.      Now next question.  I want to get her fixed.  I have been doing some research on any harmful effects that this might have on this breed and I can't find any info.  I have called my vet but she does not have any info on this either.  It is just a fact that in my area we have alot of pits and rotties and "manly" dogs, but not many working dogs.....      Any tips or info would be great.

My aunt was visiting a while ago, and out of nowhere our tiny 5lb chihuahua jumped on the couch with her and pooped right on her.   She's typically a good dog, which is why I was so shocked she did this!    My aunt visits often and is a big part of our family, so she isn't viewed as a stranger.   What does this mean in terms of the dog's POV...does she look down at my aunt as a lower species or something?

20090223115713AAXzfs2	Pets;Birds	How do you know if you bird is having seizures?	My bird past away Wed Feb 18th, and I can't help but believe that he may been having seizures. He would hang on the bars, but out of no where his head would start shaking, and he would start to fall backwards, while still holding onto the bars of the cage. His head feathers would then fluff up.   Before he died Wed, I heard his typical squeak, but when I went in to take off his cover, he was dead. I called up an expert, and he informed me that my bird may have died from a stroke/heart attack.    I read on the internet that a bird's seizures can cause a stroke, so I was wondering if that could have been the main cause of my birds death.      I don't want to have an autopsy, because of the thought, of a person cutting into my bird is disgusting and it pains me to see him like that. He had a normal diet; fruits/veggies and a little bit of seeds. He was a good diet, and he was his normal obnoxious self. lol!      Please help, because I tried finding video and articles on bird's seizures. I know it's cause by illness, diet and etc.       Thanks for the help.

For the past 3 days my spotted python has been 'baking' on his basket thing.. he hasn't gotten up or moved around - i know, i have been so concerned and watched him like a hawk. every night he is usually up and about..seriously..to the point its annoying...and when i open the cage he usually gets up from WHEREVER he is to see whats going on.. but lately he doesn't even put his HEAD up.      He looks very cloudy and hes eyes are pretty white so i am assuming he is getting ready to shed.   I know he's alive because i could see his body (heart pumping) moving when i touched him.      I feed him once every 10 days because he eats big mice.. i dont think it is a food problem..      should i be worried?

Well i have two dogs and my backyard is a strip of grass that runs from my house to the left and to the right(no fence).The people on my right never come outside and the house next door has been empty for two months.Last week a family moved in next door come to find out they have a dog as well they tie their dog outside and my dog daisy has a problem with this. So every morning daisy and this dog get into barking matches. Daisy gets very upset and her hair goes up her tail stands up and these dogs go back and forth and what i don't get is daisy has a problem with the dog but my other dog billy doesn't.Billy will come outside wagg his tail at the dog and move on. Daisy also has a problem with letting things go after i brought her in she sat at the back door and tapped her tail(she was clearly upset) for a hour. So im wondering why is it that daisy and the dog don't get along but billy and the same dog do get along?

It is kind of impossible though, because my blinds were shut still . .and it was still dark outside ..      What would cause her to do this? She was just staring at the wall and barking, like she definetly saw or heard something .. I was really scared, there was nothing in my room at all .. even when I tried to calm her down, she kept barking and barking, then I let her out of my room and went back to sleep because she went downstairs with my mom ..      what do you think?

20090223112434AAU0qbk	Pets;Dogs	How much Yogurt is safe to give a dog each day?	Okay so I have a dog who has been  on  alot of antibiotics and I have been told many times the Yogurt helps build back up some immunity that the antibiotics stripped.      How much should I be giving him each day.    I started yesterday and I gave him 2 small spoonfuls.      But I was thinking maybe he would enjoy it  more (though he already loves it) frozen in his kong.....would that be okay?      How much is safe to give him.      He is currently 9 pounds (but his normal weight is 12 pounds)      We have also been giving the same amount to our 25 pound dog as just a small treat.         How much can they have each day

It's not all the time, and when they run, it's a clear fluid. Usually, I gently dab it away with a tissue, but when I don't catch it, it dries into a brown crust of sorts. Is there something wrong with her?      Also, I was planning to bring her to the vet soon for a general exam, as she hasn't been in a while. It'll be my first time bringing her (It was my mother that always took her before, when she went), and I was just wondering what the general cost might be, and what kinds of things she'll have to get done? Things like shots, tests, etc. Basically, what should I expect when I bring her?       Thanks in advance for any feedback! =]

20090223104059AATEtLG	Pets;Dogs	Any ideas how to tell what breed of dog I have?	We just got a rescue puppy a week ago. The owners who had him abandoned him so we couldnt ask. Hes mostly a deep black, but has a small white stripe down the front of his chest and has 4 mostly brown legs. We assume hes a mixed breed but we cant really tell. There are a few breeds that we assume he may be mixed with. Hound, Black Lab, Doberman, Rottweiler, all seem like a possibility but we arent sure. Anyone have any ideas how to tell what breed he may be? Even a website that has dog pictures that we can compare his markings and structure to would help. Thanks

20090223115920AA96TEZ	Pets;Fish	Goldfishes with other-like a pink kisser?	I've had this goldfish of mine for a little over a year. Up until yesterday he had been living in a 1 gallon bowl and did great in it. I've upgraded him to living in a ten gallon tank and he's doing great and loves the extra room. He's not a fancy goldfish and is about 2in. long- if that. He's much cleaner than most goldfishes and in this tank I have a heater (he's used to being in at 75 degrees and is where the heater stays) and there's also a filter. What other fishes can I put in with him. My mother had a goldfish with 2 pink kissers and a snail once and they did great together. Any suggestions? I don't want my goldfish to end up getting lonely with a bigger tank and more room. Thank you      P.S. my goldfish likes to falloow me- not for food but if he sees me walk in the room he fallows me from one area to the other. I used to think it was because he was hungry but its not- i think he just knows I take care of him.      This goldfish has also done much traveling with me- I've been told to put him in the book of records for most traveled fish or something LOL but he's been through alot and survives and has not ever shown any signs of being sick or stressed except the one day I brought him home. Since then, he does great and loves it.

Resulting in him limping and being extremely sore. this has been happening for 2/3 years.   He goes out for walks daily, gets lots of attention and has had the same food since we bought him as a puppy, so we do not think it is caused by boredom.   He has a saw paw at the moment, our only problem being he becomes aggresive towards us and the vet if we try to apply creams or lotions. (this is purely out of fear - he is such a placid dog normally)   Does any one know of anything that may help? Any info will be gladly welcomed as we dont want him to carry on any longer for the good of his health.

We don't live together, but they will be spending about 80% of their time together with us. My boyfriend is sure he wants  a male, and I haven't decided what I want.    My question is what is there to consider when deciding whether I get a male or female? Either way, both of our puppies will be fixed, and both will be about the same age (8-10 weeks), and both will be adopted within days of each other (hopefully the same day). One will be an English Bulldog (the male) and mine will be a Pug.    Is it smarter for me to get a female, or would two males living together be just as care-free? I will base my decision on what will make the situation less complicated.    Any suggestions would be very helpful! Thanks!

20090223124122AAxerwE	Pets;Cats	Cat Behavior Question?	My 4 month old cat has issues with using the litter box lol. I use a plastic trash bag to line the litter box and instead of burying her stuff she decides to tear the bag apart. So, she is doing that pawing motion, but instead of pawing at the litter she does it to the bag and makes a complete mess and then the litter box smells worse as well because her stuff isn't covered up. How should I correct this behavior??

20090223131442AApkgdl	Pets;Dogs	Sick puppy owner trying to give it away?	So on Christmas eve my boyfriend's grandmother had four puppies.   The mom dog is horrible to her babies and she has a sick puppy with worms. She is still trying to give it away without telling them it's sick and when they were four weeks old she put them outside in the cold weather. I refuse to let her giveaway the sick puppy it needs to see a vet and she said no, the person taking care of it can take it to the vet. She doesn't believe it's sick and when I try to show her. She Ignores me.       So am I doing the right thing by not giving away the puppy with worms, because with all the negative feedback from her family makes me feel like a horrible person.      The sad thing is she wants her dog to keep having babies.      What can i do to help the sick puppy?

20090223132003AABny8t	Pets;Horses	How to keep him from "falling in" on the circle when lunging?	Kind and honest 4 yr old ottb occasionaly falls in the circle when i lunge him.   we work in tack with side reins on the lunge once or twice a week, between rides, to balance and supple him.    it is almost like he is just trying to get close to me and not loosing his balance.   i can ease him back out, by doing an upward transition, but would like to know of a more pro active way of not allowing him in to begin with.   i have tried correcting by using the lash of the lunge whip lightly on his shoulder and he took off at about 30 mph. i could not stop him, and after 20 -30 times around i was loosing strength quickly and he really bolted then.  i had to let go.   i do not want a repeat so i need to be a bit tactful with him.   how do i handle this?

I have used crops and spurs and yes i have gotten her to canter and for long periods of time! but i just want her transitions to be smoother!

20090223124338AAYmwxK	Pets;Fish	Why does my aquarium heater stay on when the tank is overheated?	I have a fairly new 150 watt heater that has been working fine.  What I'm noticing is that I adjust it to the temp that I want based on outside influences i.e. Winter weather, 68 deg in the house, lighting etc. then when the sun hits the room the tank is located in the temp jumps from 78 to 86 in just a few hours. This is a 29 gallon tank. My best guess is that the heater is not reading ACTUAL temperature and therefore is only keeping it's OWN temperature steady not necessarily WATER temperature. Has anyone else realized this or come across this? I don't want to have to adjust my therm every single time the outside conditions change.  Any heaters actually track water temp instead to assure accuracy?

Yesterday my bf called me to let me know that someone had found my dog. He had gotten out while I was gone to the store. (He had my bfs number on his tag) I happen to be out and about and could not get him immediately but she said she would hold him for a little bit. I immediately called my sister and asked her to get him for me. But when she called the lady she said she had left him outside and he mysteriously vanished yet after that she took off and stoped answering her phone. I am almost positive this woman has him since she kept asking my bf if she could have him. She also happens to be a breeder. What should I do? I have his shot records and that hes akc certified but thats it. Can the cops really help? He knows me and comes when I call but i fear she has him in a room or took him somewhere else.

20090223131437AAPI0h8	Pets;Dogs	Accused of neglecting neighbors dog?	Recently I took care of my neighbors dog for 1 week. I was told to come 10 minutes just to let the dog out (daughter comes home at night to feed them), and instead everyday I was there for 40 minutes playing with them etc. (this is not the first time I took care of their dogs - so they must think I do a fine job or they would not call me again - and money is not an issue for them, they can take the dogs to a vet for boarding).   When they came back the son (who is a snob possibly from being spoiled) made a remark to me that was bothersome. he said, "what did you neglect the dogs, you horrible person." when I told him I went every day he said "oh, well then was it to steal things from our house?" First off, I would not steal from anyone- let alone a neighbor, and two, I love animals and enjoyed taking care of their dogs (the rest of the family is very nice and pleasant as well).   None-the-less, I am trying to think of how to deal with this situation. I was thinking if the mother calls again to ask me to take care of their dogs- I would tell her I do not even feel comfortable after being accused of neglecting their dogs by one of her sons, I would say there obviously has to be trust in a situation like this and what was said was insulting and do not feel comfortable anymore, and that I am sorry..      Would that be inappropriate? It is kind of getting back indirectly at the son but at the same time letting them know that I am an honest person. Any other ideas?   thanks      First off- to understand how absurd this situation is- their daughter is home every morning and night- so she feeds them and my only job was to come during the day, and let them out to go to the bathroom.. I exceeded the time, played with them, checked their water, etc.- obviously he is not being serious about me having "neglected" the dogs but I'm sure he wanted to get under my skin and I dont know if he may have told his parents that I am untrustworthy.. Even though I am sure they know I am.
20090223131440AA94VGr	Pets;Birds	Scratchy budgie?  plz help!?	my 2 month old budgie has been scratching ALOT and i dont no if its just because its preening or just cleaning its feathers. It sometimes scrathes its wind with its feet. kinda using it like a comb. and it really picks at its feathers but doesnt really pull it out. Its really scratching almost all the time. im really scared if it has mites or something. It's beak and feet all look normal but im still worried.

20090223140139AAC86WU	Pets;Rodents	Has my hamster been mistreated? Should I find out more?	We bought our hamster about two weeks ago from Pets at Home's adoption service. We fell in love with her instantly, as she seemed very sweet and loving and funny. We splashed out on a massive rotastak system of tubes and pods as well as a nice big cage, which she loves. She's a white syrian, 4 months old, and her owners gave her up as they said that she bit a lot, and was too much for them to look after. She has never bitten us or acted hostile, and has always been lovely and sweet and very very friendly (she loves to climb on us and be held, she'll even let us kiss her on the nose!) Could she have been mistreated in her old home, or may it just have been that she was a novelty for them, and they just started picking her up and playing with her without letting her get to know them first? Should I find out more in case there may be an underlying problem due to them possibly mistreating her? Or should I just be happy in the fact that she seems to be happy and friendly?   Whatever it is, they weren't treating as they should have or she wouldn't have bitten. I think it's appalling that people buy these pets and just think of them as a novelty and plaything rather than an animal that needs to adjust and be looked after carefully. At least she has a good home now!
20090223133220AA2G5qV	Pets;Other - Pets	Is chinchilla sand a bad idea for hamsters, and should I get another?	I wanted to get a sand bath with chinchilla sand for my hamster, but now after reading some questions on here I'm not so sure. Are chinchilla sand and chinchilla dust two different things? And if so, are either of them safe for a hamster?   I know that hamsters are very clean and don't need one, but I just thought it might be fun for her.   Also, are hamster's definitely better on their own? We got her two weeks ago, and we've splashed out a lot on a massive rotastak system of tubes and pods (which she loves) as well as a nice big cage. It just seems a waste to only house one hamster in it with so many needing good homes. Would it just cause too much stress to get her a friend, as I've heard that hamsters don't really get on and are much better as solitary animals. It just seems a shame as it could easily house two comfortably.

20090223133622AAyfM3k	Pets;Dogs	What all is a vet supposed to do during a New Puppy exam?	All my vet did was give him shot and dewormer. And I asked him to check out my puppy's back legs because I thought he walked funny. Vet said he was fine, and to bring him back in a month for x-rays if I still think he's walking funny. I was surprised by the "exam".  I thought he would do more, like listen to his heart and maybe look at his eyes, ears, I don't know. I've never had a new puppy exam before. What all is he supposed to do?      Also: He was 8 weeks when this happened, and he got his first round of shots. When is he supposed to go back to get the next round? They didn't even tell me.  He is almost 10 weeks now.       P.S. His legs are fine, I'm a worry wart.

He has a pretty big on on the left side of his tail, a smaller one on the right side, one on the tip, and one underneath. I am pretty sure it is from Clyde because we belive he has a sight problem and will often miss his food when he tries eating. But those are pretty big cuts to be coming from him. I'm not sure what they are from. We do have 2 small lava rocks to help them shed thier skin, but I don't think those could hurt him like that. What could they be from, and should I do anything to try and clean them out?      Here are the pictures:      Smaller one on right side:  http://i514.photobucket.com/albums/t348/...

You know, a ridge inside the home? (for plants and such) and it's like 12 ft up high... So anyway we've been feeding some stray cats and they felt comfortable enough to come inside and eat... Didn't turn out so well cuz when my husband closed the door they went berserk and one of them ran up the curtains and jumped onto the edge of the ridge. We thought he was going to fall but he made upon the ridge.  Our ladder isn't tall enough to get him... Suggestions. ??? ( other than scolding my husband)

She is a 1 year old Lab/Whippet cross, I know from the Whippet side she would be slim but I get people look at her as if she is never fed when we are on walks!!. I'm finding it very difficult to get her to gain weight, She is on IAMS dog food and I'm now giving her twice the daily reccomended amount as she still looks very under weight.   She is fully wormed and flead up to date, and other wise seems very fit, healthy and happy, but still continues to look very skinny.   Thanks for taking the time to read this, SamY

Also, her chest is a little bigger when she's slouching. The male is very nurturing, and they cuddle more lately. Also, she has a little irritation on her chest because she's plucking her feathers too much. I was told this was because she's trying to make a nest? So, i made her a nesting box. A good sized box that fits in the cage, with a whole, and a cover, and cushion on the inside to keep everything warm and safe. Do you think i should be expecting eggs? And, any advice would be great.

We have observed that my quaker parrot is picking at the feathers around its feet, and we were informed today that she is beginning to pluck her feathers. I know that it is from stress, and I really want to help her before she engrosses herself even more in this behavior. As of now it shes not missing a lot of feathers, but I know it will incline if we do not do anything. Has anyone had this problem before, and corrected it. I have given her tons of new toys and they keep her occupied and I have been staying in the room, and talking to her quietly to distract her from plucking. It has been working, but I can not stay with her 24/7 but she does get a really good amount of attention from about 4 other family members. Please tell me about your experiences I have read just about everything on the web. Any information about how to stop this behavior would be really appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

20090223102151AA1xmY1	Pets;Cats	One of my cats ran away, please advice on how to proceed?	I have two cats, well technically kittens, male/female, about 7 months old. All this while they had been indoors, but off late they would meow quite frantically as if wanting to go out. I live in an apartment complex, so was reluctant to let them out. A friend of mine suggested to keep a window to my terrace open, so that they can venture out if they want. She convinced me that cats are territorial and will come back, once they have explored the surrounding. I was stupid enough to believe this. I got up in the morning to find my cats missing. I found the male one on the ground floor ledge (My apartment is on 3rd-4th floor) he was crying like hell. ( he is the one neutered, the female is not). But the female is nowhere to be found. I have already informed the apartment security, but so far nothing. The female was always more aggressive and would not let anyone handle her, she wouldn't even let the vet clip her claws, nor will she take easily to any vaccination. She was fiercely feline I guess and I loved her for that. Also I think she was in heat the night she left. The male cat would follow her around, and try and do whatever she did. But he is not as sharp as her.   I am really worried, I don't know how will she eat. I keep checking the rooms/doors/windows to see if I hear a meow. The male cat is shaken from the escapade I guess, but is improving now.   Please advice how to search for the female?

I just had my chinchillas teeth shortened and his fur is still wet from the drool that he was expelling while his teeth were still long. What do I do to get his fur back to normal? Do I just wait for it to grow back? Do I continue to give him regular baths?
