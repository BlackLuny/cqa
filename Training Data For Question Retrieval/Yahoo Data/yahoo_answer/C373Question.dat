I sit in this computer chair in my basement when I check my e-mails, and I am a flatulent girl a lot of the time. Well, I do a lot of farts in that chair. It is a black cloth chair. When I got up one time and looked at it, it seemed to have a stain on it, like someone spilt something on it and it dried but you could still see the stain. It wasn't a different colour but it looked different. Could this be from my gas?      No I am not obsese.

Well they don't smell and most of the stains I think will clean out but they eventually need to be replaced.  But due to other costs we have to address first we want to clean them.  Is calling a professional steam cleaner the best way to go?  Does steam cleaning really do a good job?  We have shampood carpets before with horrible results.

20090205130751AA9oGfL	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Noob - tile under toilet?	Recently bought an older home that has carpet in the bathroom.  The toilet as a leaky seal that's keeping the carpet wet, which is nasty.  We're going to pull the carpet up, put down some cheap peal & stick tile (for now) and get someone out here to re-seal the toilet.      My question is, do we have them fix the toilet first, then put the tile down and just flush it up to the base.  Or do we need to put the tile down while the toilet is up so they can bolt the toilet onto the tile.  Trying to figure out the best way to go about this.  Oh, and if it makes a difference, it's on a concrete slab.
