You should go to school and earn a degree majoring in biology, zoology, wildlife biology, wildlife management or something along those lines.|`|HZ7Dlz3kaa	Wildlife conservationist is a biologist, just a different aspect.  What you need to learn about specifically is ecology and how living things interact with each other and their non-living environment.  this is crucial when trying to conserve living things.  biology is a HUGE field and ecology right now has a very nice movement, everything is going green!  study marine biology, environment studies, and perhaps remediation...plenty of money in that...|`|AA11922229	Destroy all rifles and ammo.<br>  <br>  Get an MBA in Business, become a business tycoon, purchase large sections of wild habitat declaring it a wildlife preservation zone, donate money to Green Peace , Audubon Society, and the Wildlife Fund.<br>  <br>  Get an environmental degree become an teacher, live poor the rest of your life.|`|0a5ef0d74bd69b2ac52243c93130fd88aa	My recommendation would be to get the science degree -- Biology or Zoology -- while doing an internship for The Nature Conservancy or the like.

AyiDXBTxaa	I would stay away from soft drinks to begin with. They're not the healthiest drinks...<br>  <br>  But if you really have to, buy aluminum and be sure to recycle.|`|2K84ouyKaa	from a health stand point plastic is better because studies show aluminum causes health problems but so do soft drinks so pick your poison|`|5TKEtXERaa	Well below are several sites that ask just that and come up with different answers but they seem to agree. Once the aluminum is made it is easier to recyle so I would say if the bottler of whatever your drinking uses mainly recycled aluminum for it's cans aluminum. If not then it is plastic.|`|xvr5nK9aaa	If your having a party it's best to get them in plastic bottles because not everyone will finish their drinks, if it's just for you consumption, then aluminium is the best because you can drink it later and is portable.  I heard that plastic bottles release chemicals into whatever it is holding, not sure if this is true or not, but it's probably just a little bit that won't really affect you.<br>  <br>  You should just drink tap water, it's cheap, it's clean*, and it's envirmentally friendly.<br>  <br>  * It's mostly clean...|`|HZ7Dlz3kaa	cans because aluminium is a metal and can be recycled many many times...plastic bottle when recycled lose quality quickly and will end up in a landfill faster...|`|PZJdWBQiaa	the cans and plastic bottles are now both recycleable.so dont worry about that.|`|9701f5a04b0788301d3119e00ccedc0aaa	Drink water and beer.

bxs3pAAjaa	recycling- its better than cheap...you can actually earn back money by taking your uncrushed cans and plastic bottles to a recycling place like behind a ralph's or something and earn money. also, look into compost to use as a good free fertilizer. cutting down shower time, turning off electronics and lights when you leave a room, replacing lightbulbs with energy efficient bulbs will also be better for the environment by conserving energy and also cuts down on the energy bill. carpooling or riding a bike or walking will cut down on carbon emissions, save money, and give you exercise!|`|cpxkROqMaa	These links will give you some good simple ways to go green.|`|3oanK9hkaa	1. Recycle... and yes, it is cheap. You just stop being so wasteful. Here are two articles (linked below) to get you started.|`|FvMtam2Aaa	Recycling would be a good start.|`|kwBlywL0aa	Recycle, ride a bike, turn down the heat a little in the winter, turn up the heat a little in the summer, recycle your clothing at a donation center there are people much less fortunate than you, turn off lights whenever you leave a room unless you are going in and out of it every minute it takes more energy to turn lights on and off than to just turn it off or leave it on until you are done using it for a while. don't go shopping every day, wear clothes multiple times don't use something once and throw it out, turn off the faucet when you are not using it. Eat less meat, cows actually release a chemical from their breath that is good for the environment. Buy less wood-based products. isolate your house, buy Green windows (not literally green) these windows have 2 layers the outside layer for example in the summer it absorbs the heat and lets cool air into your house with the other layer winter vice versa, use energy efficient bulbs they last a LOT longer and are more energy efficient, they are brighter too.<br>  More expensive things: buy a fuel efficient car, use solar heating/electricity if you live in an area that gets a decent amount of sun and the extra GREEN energy you make with solar you can sell to the electric company in this way you make a little money.<br>  <br>  Now this is a start to all the things you can do do some research for other things! but this is a lot of it|`|DGPUdOOjaa	I think where you start is an individual preference. I only do a few things such as recycle good clean clothing, baby items. We also recycle plastic bags and newspapers at a recycling place in my town which is managed by local 4-H clubs. There are many other ways that  you can make a difference|`|A3rBif8yaa	You can use eco friendly products at work and in offices something like LED lamps.|`|X4LyCgkTaa	recycle, use a bus and try , dont take long showers , use less electricity and ride your bicycle whenever possible.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	global warming is fake. Its called seasons changing|`|5TKEtXERaa	The best way to start is to REDUCE recycling is great but before you do anything.<br>  <br>  THINK     These are less expensive to do than what you are doing now<br>  <br>     Combine trips rather than going to get something and then coming home and going back out to get something else.<br>  <br>    Carpool, take public transportation, bike, or walk. <br>  <br>     When shopping look for items that have less packaging (less waste) use reusable bags no money or effort needed to recycle because you never used the disposable bags.<br>  <br>     When you are home turn off items you are not using, switch to cfl or led's (this will save money inside of the first year) plug chargers,game systems, tv's anything that uses standby power in to power strips and when you are done for the night shut them off.<br>  <br>     Save water by buying a aerator that screws onto your faucet for around $2 cutting the usage at the sink by up to 40% also install low flow shower heads.<br>  <br>     Clean the coils on your refrigerator, turn your thermostat down a degree or two, change your house's air filter.<br>  <br>  After you have done all these steps towards reducing then stress recycling earth911.com is a great site for this.

Of course, many advocate severe reduction of the earths population by allowing mass starvation, the destruction of the free enterprise system, and the complete destruction of the US military , the total acceptance of gay lesbians as peers and establishment of 'scientists' as the new high priests for the religion of "global warming".  They then finish off their diatribes by say something philosophical like, "well even if we are not correct about anthropogenic global warming, the things we want to do are still good to do"...Nice people, all.  And yes, they do have explanations for the ice ages, they do not make sense, but they make as much sense as much of their idiotic ideas....|`|ywOqliwKaa	Very good question! The debate is NOT over by a long shot.
AA10072285	WHY? Because a sanitary landfill is designed and constructed to be the most effective way to "dispose" of this nation's horrific amount of waste. Not all waste is recyclable in all areas. Even if it were, there are currently very few laws mandating recycling and there are a large number of people out there who refuse to recycle no matter how easy and convenient the city or county makes it. So we are always going to have some waste to dispose of. If operated properly by licensed personnel, there is very little odor, noise, litter onsite and a minimum of hazardous materials entering the landfill that could cause future breaks in the liner.<br>  <br>  HOW? The more that is recycled, the less goes to a landfill, thereby preserving valueable space for only those materials that cannot be recycled. It is becoming increasingly popular for environmenalist groups to protest building of landfills and many local gov't groups have been overruled by them.  Therefore, it only makes sense to make your existing landfill or expansion last as long as possible - RECYCLE!!|`|IeGE2CtSaa	Is there really any such thing as a sanitary landfill? I don't think so. Either way, chemicals seep into the Earth and harm aquifers or leak into local bodies of water. Also, some items don't even decompose completely. I don't think any kind of landfill is good. Even "sanitary" ones.
kqa9VFrfaa	Get in touch with the Audubon Society for birds. Call your nearest Department of Natural Resources. Also look for mom, and put the baby back if U can, and watch closely keep the baby shaded, and administer fluids by dropper if mama is not spotted in a couple of hours. The bird must have liquid-- even if it is plain water. U can mix a thin gruel of cooked egg yolk in water to feed by dropper in an emergency|`|DoHaUEziaa	Call your local state and wildlife office or go to that website. I would try placing the baby back in the nest. Whether the mother will take care of it or not remains to be seen but it has a better chance there then anywhere else. It has been out of the nest for quite a while after just hatching. I don't know what you can do as baby hummers are so tiny. I wish you and baby hummer the best.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	Can you put it back in the nest? Probably the mother is looking for it. Put it back in there for a day to see if the mother returns. Some counties do have an animal rehabilitation organization and some do not, best thing to do is look up the SPCA and Animal Shelters (they won't take the bird but may know of any groups that rescue wildlife in your area). Vets may know as well.

Similarly it will grab the oxygen out of water, leaving H2.   If the H2 and CO are left with an iron cobalt oxide catalyst at 300 C and 10 to 60 bars of pressure, it will form gasoline and some methane.   So all you need is a lot of energy to heat, cool and compress and you can take the exhaust and turn it back into fuel and oxygen so just strap a nuclear power plant and a small refinery onto that car of yours and you're all set.

bg1DpPhXaa	Well, they are baking something up already.    Though it is still three years away from completing the assembly of the international space station, NASA said Monday that it has begun to assess how part of the orbital outpost could be used for research by other federal agencies and private companies.    The doors to half of the U.S. portion of the station could swing open in 2011.    The planning comes in response to federal legislation in 2005 that designated the U.S. part of the 16-nation orbital base as a national laboratory.    "There are still a lot of details that are not there yet," William Gerstenmaier NASA's associate administrator for space portions, said at a news briefing Monday. "(But) we feel strongly that if we don't begin some preparatory work on how we use the lab, we could not be in a position to utilize it."    The National Institutes of Health has shown the greatest interest. Other agencies that may use the outpost for research include the Pentagon, National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the departments of Energy, Commerce and Agriculture.    Three years ago, President Bush directed the space agency to finish the station's assembly in 2010 so that NASA can return to the moon.    As a result of its lunar exploration plans, NASA has re-focused its research plans for the station on medical research that reveals how the human body responds to months of weightlessness and the testing of equipment that could be used on deep space exploration.   The focus means NASA will need only half the lab space it will create on the station, leaving a surplus for other federal agencies and the private sector to use, said NASA's Mark Uhran, an assistant associate space station administrator who is leading preparations for the transition.    NASA would continue to operate and maintain the station at an annual cost of about $1.5 billion annually throughout its life span. Federal agencies and private companies that sign up to use space station for research would be responsible for paying the cost of their experiments.    U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, principal author of the legislation establishing the station as a national laboratory, applauded NASA's efforts.    I heard Hutchison say that they now have a firm foundation on which to plan for the full and complete use of the space station as it was always intended.    So next couple of years will be very interesting.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	We currently have no spacecraft with the necessary power to get there.

DqmMW2tcaa	There are many different types of ecological areas such as desserts, bush, rainforset etc. The plants in each of these environemnts usually have characteristics that make them different from other enviroments, and plants from the same type of communities across the world will often share characeristics in common. In the case of Rainforests for example, all Rainforsts usually have very tall trees that make up the canopy. Therefore there is very little light getting through to the ground below, so the plants on the forest floor have adapted to poor light. Also many rainforsts have plants such as lianas (thick vines). They have have plants such as epiphytes which grow on the trunk of large trees but don't actually harm the trees such as orchids. <br>  <br>  There are also plants which are parasitic such as strangler figs which start when a bird drops a seed in a tree. The seed germinates, sends down roots and eventually the fig end up totally smothering the host tree.<br>  <br>  Another key characteristic of rainforsts is that they all are in areas of high rainfall. Even if the soil is poor, but there is a lot of rain, there can still be rainforest eg Fraser Island off the Queensland coast in Australia|`|Ru4CSc1raa	They are also humid.|`|mud7i4f9aa	They have Unicorns and leprechans!
