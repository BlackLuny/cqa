My mom died recently and I wasn't able to get the recipe from her.  Here's what I do know: You boil 2 boxes of frozen spinach.  You cook 1 pound of bacon.  You pour the water off of the spinach- ALL of the water?  You crumble the bacon and put it in the spinach at some point and somehow you thicken the spinach so it holds together.  It tastes wonderful.  As a kid I always wondered why people didn't like spinach.  I didn't realize they didn't cook it like this.  Does anyone have any ideas about this recipe.  Thanks

20090226180258AAMFgN3	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Are these vegetarian foods?	I'm vegetarian, used to be vegan but i was very low on a lot of nutrients because I wasn't very good at it. Since i recently converted back it's become a lot more difficult to  know if what I'm eating is vegetarian.       I'm sort of on the speical k diet as well so i eat a lot of their products like cereal, crackers, protein water and snack bars.      I also eat totinos pizza and tortillas with cheese spaghettios aside from my fruits and veggies.       My question is should i be at all concerned that any of these aren't vegetarian...iv'e been vegan for quite a few years and not eating animal products is very important to me..:) any other products you know that i can buy at the store that are vegetarian also would be awesome.  thanks!
