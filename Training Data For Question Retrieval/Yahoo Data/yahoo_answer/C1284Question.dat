Listen please dont say im wierd and stupid because I beleve in ghosts, demons, angles, god ...      I have saw a witch with my own eyes...       She looks nothing like what you see in movies!

Her hair is black and messed up her teeth are rotten and her face is just... dirty... scary...full of infected scratches.      But do you beleve this?      Also I saw that witch when it was dark out and I was looking in my parents room window. I felt someone behind me and I was suprised it was a witch I thought it was my mom or dad bt then I ran past her and to my living room and told my parents they said I was dreaming and I tell them about this all every week but I always get the sae respond!

20090309131035AA8YUFQ	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Id like logical answers to this seemingly paranormal happening?	I was on the phone with a friend a few nights ago and he was telling me about the apostles and an encounter he'd had... well leave it at that.. however.. the lights in the kitchin of my house flickered a few times.. (I was always told it was an entity in the room when that happens, i assumed he knew that too) So I mentioned it to him. He said mine was doing the same thing. As soon as he said that we both said there it goes again (the lights flickered again). Now. We live 35 miles apart... So we dont even share the same realm of power providers. It was also just in the kitchen in my house. Aside from the last time it happened, it did it in the room I was sitting in so i grabbed my stuff and left... SO now id really be interested in logical reasons... or a way to expel this energy from my home.

Today I was talking to this guy and he asked me to go to this concert with him this weekend, and i said i might not be able to go because i'm grounded. later he looks at me and says "you really need to bring your grades up, because i want to take you to that concert so bad." then he just stared at my eyes and i asked him what he was doing and he said he was looking at my pupils. I asked why and him and his friend just look at each other and laugh.       I was curious about why he was doing that so i looked it up and i read somewhere that if you have big pupils it means you have a sexual urge? I wonder if that's what he was looking for?    he's a player and i would never consider going out with him. Im just curious as to why he wanted to see my pupils. so if you have any idea please let me know :)   Thanks!

Or, said another way, node 1 is the only node that can communicate directly with all (any) other nodes -- the other nodes have to go through 1 in order to get to somewhere else.      Node 1 seems to be sort of the "nexus" of the graph...is there a term for this property?      Thanks for any info!

20090309150027AANrIkb	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How does the Law of Action-Reaction apply to a roller coaster?	I'm doing a project and im really stuck on action-reaction and the Law of inertia. Please help im in the 8th grade. here's what i have so far...      Law of Inertia:    The law of Inertia applies to this roller coaster when there is a free fall. When youâ€™re falling down, it feels like your stomach is going down. This means that your stomach is resistance to change in motion. ??      Law of Acceleration:    The Law of Acceleration applies to the vertical loop of the roller coaster. The acceleration applies to it because the cart enters the loop with very high speed. This will cause a heavy force to occur, but only for a few seconds which will make acceleration stress. The peopleâ€™s queasiness is caused by the organs going upward. Another way Acceleration effects the roller coaster is by the high-speed drops, and turns as well. Acceleration can also be at the bottom of the hill, which causes zero acceleration. This means that at that point the speed it the highest than on any other par to the hill.       Law Action- Reaction       The Law Action-Reaction applies to the drop of the roller coaster. The weight of the car, and riders are pressing against the track, which causes the reaction of gravity.

I am 14 years old, and one of my career goals would be becoming an astronaut. I know I would do this by going to the Naval Academy, getting an engineering degree, becoming a pilot, etc. But what could I do now to prepare myself? I know the first manned missions to Mars will be starting as I am around that age for an astronaut, so I know I would have opportunities. Also, I'm talking about out of school, I know that I should take science and math courses in HS and so on, but I'm asking what I can do outside of school. For example, should I begin study a certain type of engineering or science on my own time? If so, which one? I have installed the program "Orbiter" and I think that will help me. ALSO, I have not shut out all of my doors, because I know someone will say that. I am still interested in different careers, but this one would be the most challenging and most interesting to me.

20090309155630AA91S82	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Engineers: Best Bridge Structural Efficiency?	Hey guys,       I am creating a bridge out of 3/32" Balsa Wood, and need to give it the best structural efficiency.       I have asked this question before, but got minimal replies.       Which type of bridge has more potential for great Structural Efficiency, meaning, what design can I use that will be very light, and carry the biggest load possible.       To put this into perspective, I need to carry a maximum load of 15,000g (15KG), looking for the total mass of the bridge to be about 10 grams.       These numbers are not exact, and I dont need to hold the biggest mass, I just need the best structural efficiency (E=Max Load Supported/Mass of Bridge)      Thanks for looking, I only have a couple of days to do this so any tips are appreciated!        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge    There is a general wiki article with the types of bridges =D

20090309161122AAgsDyR	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Will St. John's Wort interfere with Dexamphetamine?	After a bad reaction to Zoloft, my doctor recently had me on Bupropion with Dexamphetamine. The combination was terrible, damn near had a heart attack. Turns out the Bupropion was blocking dopamine release by Dexamphetamine and while enhancing its noradrenalin effects. Now we both agreed on trying St. Johnâ€™s Wort, something natural and non-synthetic. However, I understand it works on the same chemicals as Dexamphetamine, but want to know if it will interfere with the way Dexamphetamine works on its own, because itâ€™s doing a good job, but not so much with anxiety.      My doctor said no, but thatâ€™s what he said last time, so some confirmation from other on this one would be good. I hope someone out there knows, but please donâ€™t guess. Thank you!

20090309174918AAmST96	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	I once found some weird white rocks...?	me and my mom were driving down a dirt road out in the country about 10 years ago and we came upon some strange rocks. we collected a few and brought them home to look at them. what made them so strange was that they were very porous(the holes were like little dimples in the surface), had an oily texture, were fairly heavy, and had a hard texture like plastic but more like glass. we put them in a wal-mart bag. by the lime we got home they were sweating through the bag, again, oil. this was extra weird as i had never seen something sweat through a bag like that! i did some temperaments on it. i took a small piece and put a flame to it, and it was not flammable,but it melted into a clear thick liquid. so this lead me to think it was heroine or something! after about two days the rock was about half the size it was when we first got it. there was a puddle of the clear oil under the bag.      does any body have any idea what this stuff was???

20090309175132AAp1xPq	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	PV=nRT Chemistry question!!!!?	The labs in SEL are approximately 595 feet above sea level. Further, the weather in Chicago rapidly changes and the SEL labs are chilly in Winter and hot in Summer. In this experiment, you are calculating vapor density (m/M) for an unknown substance, and you must utilize the gas constant R in this calculation. We determined the value of R in class using experimental data, substituted into the equation, PV=nRT. In the spaces below, enter the variables in this equation that are most likely to cause an error in calculations in lab, using the standard value of R. Enter one variable only in each field, using upper- or lower-case letters, as appropriate.
