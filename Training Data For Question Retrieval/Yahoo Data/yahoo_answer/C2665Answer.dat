rrLHU6ehaa	Yes, remove the crayfish.  It probably eats at night, so it's unlikely you'd see it eat them.  Does it hide during the day?  If so, it's nocturnal.  The shrimp aren't, so are at risk.|`|x4etCpauaa	It could be the crayfish.  It could be water quality.  Could be the size of the tank.  If there is the right requirements to take care of the shrimp, such as crystal shrimp/tiger shrimp need lower pH to thrive. Cherry shrimp live in whatever does not need special attention. All 3 need warmer temps around 74.  Crayfish need colder water.    If it is the crayfish, than remove it.    ("'\(o.o)/"')
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	If they're small enough to fit in a 1.5g they're too young to sex.    Goldfish need a far larger tank than you have, preferably at least 15-20 gallons each for fancies, larger for commons. Your fish will get almost to the size of a 1.5g, without the water.    To breed they need to be mature, over 1 yr old, and at least 5"-6" long (that's just body, not including fins). You need several well filtered tanks, at least 30-40 gallons, or a pond, to breed. They are egg scatterers so do not get pregnant.    You need a larger tank ASAP!!!

Have you changed his litter or his food? Have you gotten anything new? ie, cat, dog, baby, girlfriend, boyfriend. anything that he might be threatened by?  But who knows. Cats do weird things sometimes.   Ask your vet to make sure that he doesn't have a urinary infection or problem.  Good luck|`|pxMf2axzaa	UGH...ive had the excact same problem when my cay ust to urinate on the bed, walls and where-ever he can get his pee on. like you metioned, this is just a sighn of marking territory but one way that can be certain to get him to sop for good (like i did with my cat) is to take him to the vet for an operaration known as neturing a cat. this is simply getting a few of your cats genitels cut off to stop him from his hormonic cycle.  it worked for my cat anyway but it is abit pricey at 70. im not sure how much dollars that would be so if you take the right decision to do so, save up from now  hope i helped!  ;)|`|WqGxGJkbaa	First of all you need to have your cat checked for a urinary infection.  Secondly, provide him with extra litter trays.  All cats should have one tray for pee and one for poo as many will not use the same tray for both functions.  This can start at any time and it does not matter whether they have always used just the one litter tray in the past.    If your cat has always been used to urinating outside then there is probably a reason why he is refusing to do so now - too cold/too wet/other cats intimidating him or something as simple as the sound of wind blowing through the trees can put a cat off for life and you must provide him with litter trays.    Make sure the litter is as close to sand as possible as this is soft on their paws.  Don't use scented litter and don't use a hooded tray.  Keep the trays well away from food and water.  If you think your cat is stressed by something/someone then you should try Feliway Artificial Pheromone Diffusers which you plug in around your house and they will calm and reassure him.
YpEswTQdaa	Hi,    I have tried this actually & have had some Stunners,just its,often its hard to calculate the exact time to,i used to do it quite a lot,will have to start doing it again. With the Dwarf Lops,i had some really cobby/chunky examples,which were practically perfect,however sometimes it makes no difference. Whether its a coincidence,idk.    Hope this helps & its good to know you are really researching,before breeding! Best wishes.xxx|`|apTmBRlFaa	havnt tried it but have tried palnting veg by moon phases and compered it to non moon pahsed veg.. it did seem to work as well!!! there are things we dont understand in the world and this may be one of them. most people read horoscopes and this is just the same.   hope it works x|`|f96ecf10164e7f3a9da36cca8ac9ce14aa	I don't see how the moon phases would tie in with a liter of kits, but I guess it could. I've never tried this, as I don't breed rabbits, and I'm not too sure I would try this. There seems to be a bunch of scientific information missing, which would deter me from believing this, but it is possible that the moon phases do have something to do with the number of does to bucks in a liter.    Once a rabbit is done wrong, it may hold a lifetime grudge.
w4DIPHf1aa	you don't automatically need one....    In fact i rarely see them, not to say they don't work but know your water first.    second Discus are now being breed in straight up tap water and don't need half the water conditioning they use to.    So ask were your getting them from if they are in fact breed in city water. If not you may want to move on.    An R.O system is just a tank with a membrane, tap water goes threw and gets squeezed threw a .5 to .1 micron membrane into a holding tank.    then out a spout to you.      Use that water to fill your tank, most people buy small r.o systems and put them under there kitchen sink.    Other people to just to a water store and buy 15 gallon jugs of the stuff for 4 dollars.    good luck!!!|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	The RO filter doesn't go directly on the tank.  It makes filtered water, which you store in a tub or tank, and then use the RO water for water changes.    The RO is hooked up to your tap water supply.
kC8JHWVQaa	Yea right build or make one is Right the same thing either way you will need to do either since the birds will need before you even get them !! Where do you plan on keeping them till the coop is done in your home or garage a shed a barn ???You will need a safe place for the birds from day 1, from jump street,  asap!!  If you have a coop you can raise the birds inside this coop till they are ready to be let out in the yard this coop is in this helps the birds know the coop is there home where food comes from water source and the birds will return to the coop at night for the protection they need from other critters making them their dinner later in the night.   While the birds are peeps if you get peeps the best place to keep them is in a coop till at least4-5 months for size and for birds to know this is the home base for them plus it helps to not loose any during the day or night if have chicken wire fence for fencing.Not much can get in and birds cant get out have a latch door to keep closed at night. and to keep birds safe have a roost in the coop for birds to sit on and a small container of water as well Chickens are so neat to watch grow from a peep to a fullgrownn roo or hen have done so now for awhile and enjoy it every time. You will too. good luck with the new coop,.|`|YhH0PNupaa	To the person who said you should build the coop b/f you get the chicks b/c they need a place to live, obviously you have no chickens. They will spend the first 6-9 weeks of their lives in a brooder.   If the question is should you build or buy? That is up to you. I prefer to build my own, so they are like I want them, but you can buy them for about the same price unless you find scrap materials. Building materials are high right now. How many chicks are you getting? That makes a difference in what you need. Head over to backyardchickens.com and have a look at their coop design page, and then check out the message board, there is a whole section on building coops.|`|6VFh61jhaa	Hey Adam! Building and making a coop is the same thing.     You have to have the coop ready before you get the chicks because they need somewhere to live.
MGxDgsKZaa	Dragging his butt on the ground is called "scooting" which indicates impacted anal glands or another health problem that will need to be treated. He needs another checkup which should include an anal exam (the vet will stick his finger in his bottom). Definitely take him back to the vet or to another vet who will give him a more thorough check-up. Your cat is uncomfortable so don't wait too long! Good luck!|`|vl6OtBfWaa	I would also change his food never wet food this is bad for their teeth and their poop.  Change food give it a couple of months and see he should poo solid relatively dry turds that just drop out in pieces if he needs to wipe his butt its cause his poop is too wet.    You are in this for the long haul find a solution don't discard a living being he is like a child. raise him like you did your kids positive reinforcement praise for good behavior and scold when bad behavior arises try alternatives and never give up.  You or someone in your family has to be the pack leader it should be apparent which person the cat defers to that is the person who will have the best results because the cat wants always the praise of the pack leader.|`|LfGQjuZnaa	Maybe try putting a towel out for him. Or scold him for it. That is the only way he will learn. That is what we had to do for our cat. Then if none of those work the only thing i can think of is to wipe it off for him....    =)|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Wow, and I thought I had cat problems!  It could be that the food you are giving him is causing problems and he is having rectal issues.  Try putting an old towel or something in front of the litter box for him to wipe on. Also you might change the kind of litter to a finer one that would cover the poo more efficiently. The cheap, thick litter doesn't cover poo well.|`|3seIFRNVaa	my kitten used to step in her poo allll the time. so what i started to do is when she was done id take the scooper and cover it for her real quick. so she couldnt step in it. after a week or so she realized if she covered it as soon as she was done she wouldnt get poo on her paws.. hope this helps..|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You have my sympathies - I have one who does exactly the same.  HOWEVER, he only does it when he has constipation and/or diarrhoea.  Is your cat producing "normal" stools?  If so, I think the only thing you can do is to trim the fur away to avoid anything getting stuck.  If he is producing stools which are too wet/too dry then you might have to look at what you are feeding him.      Otherwise, when you see him heading for the litter tray - grab a paper towel and run!!!!    Edit - Oh yes, Gina is absolutely right about the anal glands.  If they are impacted he will be uncomfortable when he poos and will try to stop it by rubbing.  Your vet can sort this very easily.    Edit again - Yes, definitely try taking the lid off the hooded tray.  A lot of cats don't like them as the smell builds up inside and they want to get out quickly (if they even go in at all - hooded trays are one of the main contributors to toileting problems)!  A cat also needs to stand up slightly when it is pooing and hooded trays sometimes hinder this position.  Both of these things could be connected to your problem.    Contrary to what someone has suggested - please DO NOT give your cat an entirely dry diet because someone has come up with the lie that it is good for teeth - this is completely unfounded.  A completely dry diet is one of the major contributing factors of diabetes and kidney/urinary problems.  A cat needs meat not fillers/carbs and other junk contained in most dry food.  I have one cat with diabetes and another with struvite crystals and I can honestly say that a quick dental check up would have been far preferable to dealing with these 2 life threatening illnesses.  Get good quality food which is high protein/low carb with no grains/fillers and hopefully you will see an improvement.|`|xde0uuuBaa	try using a different brand of litter. and put a stepping mat in front of the litter box (one from the pet store made specifically for cats)  my cat has a bad habit of wiping his paws on the walls and stuff, but when we bought different brands of litter he stopped. so..try that. hope it helps|`|T1kRNoxCaa	If he has long fur, shave his bum so the poo won't stick.
rrLHU6ehaa	I would never suggest cleaning a tank with goldfish.  Use green scub pads that have no cleansers/chemicals added.  Also, syphoning gunk from the bottom during the weekly water changes are needed when cleaning an aquarium.|`|tShDXmgbaa	Just make sure the treated replacement water is as near as room temp. as possible and only remove 2-3 gallons per 10 gallons of water. Also if you clean the filter pad at the same time you do the water change...make sure you rinse the filter pad in some of the tanks water...otherwise you will kill your entire good bacteria colony.  I forgot to use the tank water to clean my filter pad when the water change was being done and now my tank is cloudy as I may have killed the entire good bacteria colony so now I have just wait til the tank water clears which will take about 72 hours.
ZNDqYUwkaa	By the time a puppy comes to your home it should be at least 8 weeks old, so find out what the adult weight of the dog will be and work out the amount of puppy food per day according to the guidelines on the food packaging.  Then, divide this equally between 3 meals and allow at least 4 hours between each feed to allow the digestive system time to cope with it without being overwhelmed.    You should try not to fuss your puppy too much for the first few days so that it can get comfortable and build confidence in your home and build trust in you. Have the puppy in a crate in your room at night and take it out to potty right before you go to bed. If you hear the puppy wake up in the night, get up, take it outside to go potty and come back in to bed.Make sure when you wake up in the morning, or the pup wakes up in the morning, you do the same and take it straight outside.  You shouldn't have to do this too long and 6 out of the 7 dogs I've had from puppies have actually slept through the night anyway, but needed to go the moment they woke up.    Good luck and enjoy your new puppy.|`|KOdLWJaQaa	It depends on how young your pup will be.  Ideally, they should not be younger than 8 weeks, 12 would be the best though.  That being said, we got our pup at five and a half weeks.  His mom stopped nursing him at 4 weeks, and then would have nothing to do with him.  When he came home, I fed him canned food mixed with dry, 4 times per day,(every 3 hours or so) for a week or two.  By 8 weeks, he ate 3 times per day mixed.  At 4 months, he started eating twice per day mixed.  Now, at almost 6 months, he still eats twice per day, but dry only.  As far as taking him out at night, when he first came home, he went out last at 11pm, then out at about 2:30, and 5am.  By the time he was 9 weeks or so, he only went out once per night, and by 12 weeks or so, he would wait all night.  As far as the feeding goes, if you get your pup from a reputable breeder or a shelter, they will be able to give you feeding instructions.  I hope it helps.|`|nZg00MQOaa	A puppy eats a lot of food. From birth up to six months of age, he'll need to eat two to four times as much as an adult dog to support all that growth. A good rule of thumb (paw?) is that after his first week of life, when his weight doubles from what it was at birth, a puppy should gain one to two grams per pound of anticipated adult weight each day. This means that if your German Shepherd puppy weighs 75 pounds as an adult, he should gain three to five ounces per day as a puppy.

New studies show that they can stay active in the body 3-7 years (longer for smaller breeds) You can call the vet and ask them if the do titering.

This way they are still UTD on shots.|`|W7WganJ4aa	What you're saying is that your dog had her first (puppy) shots and those are the only vaccinations she had so far.  Now a year after the vaccinations your dog is still alive, but showing internal problems.    No the vaccinations did not cause this.  Things like a liver shunt could cause it, long term medication (NSAIDS) could cause it, one set of vaccinations a year ago, isn't going to be causing this.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	No, basically. Vaccinations are incredibly thoroughly tested, they would not cause liver problems. Presumably your vet offered a suggestion for why this may have happened? Elevated ALT alone does not necessarily indicate liver problems.    You really need to discuss these questions with your vet. The majority of people on Yahoo are pretty anti-vaccs, I can only imagine the sort of answers you might get!    Chalice    EDIT: Yes there is debate over the long term effects of yearly vaccinations on the immune system, but there isn't debate about the short or long-term effects on the liver.

Make sure fish appear active and bright. Fins should be clear and dorsals raised. If all these areas are acceptable, then you just have to wait for the black spots to fade as the fish heals.

Depending on the size of their tank, 20% water changes should be down at least once a week.  At this point it would probably be best to do 50% asap, then 10% every other day for a week.  That's if their tank is at least 20 gallons.  If not, get them a 30 gallon tank with a filter, and maintain weekly water changes of 20%.

A nursing mother will eat up to 3 times her normal amount so make sure she has a constant supply of dry food and water easily accessible.  You can increase her fluid intake by giving her low sodium chicken broth.<br>  <br>  There are commercial products like PetAlive Lactoll that increase lactation, but will most likely have to be ordered.  You can go to a health food grocery store like Wild Oats and they have herbal preparations containing fennel and fenugreek, blessed thistle, etc. that are used to increase milk supply (lactation aids). <br>  <br>  The puppies should be weighed twice a day and they should be gaining weight.  You don't say the breed, but food scales are only about $10.00 and have a bowl on top and weigh to about 7 pounds.  If they aren't gaining weight or they are crying a lot than you may need to supplement to meet their demands, but try to get mom producing more first because the less they eat, the less she will make.<br>  <br>  Edit:  pet's milk is evaporated milk.  It has twice the amount of lactose as cow's milk when compared on a cup to cup basis.  Somes dogs do fine with lactose, but many are lactose intolerant and it will cause diarrhea.

However, if "she" is a young cockatiel as "she" gets older her face could change into have more white, meaning "she" is a he.  Young cockatiels often have barring like the pied mutations.  As boy cockatiels get older, they loose thier barring.  Girls do not generally.<br>  Cockatiels are easiest to tell just by thier songs.  Males have a distinct good morning song.  Females do not have the same song, they chirp, but they don't have the songs.|`|hWLO2br7aa	I had a white faced pearl pied cockatiel, so pretty! anyway, you'd have to feel the underside of your bird to find out if it's a girl or boy. it has to be an adult, juveniles are hard to sex. the vent area will be wide in a female and narrow in a male. the pet store might be able to tell you if you take it back there or a vet or a bird breeder. as for the split to pied or not, haven't a clue. sorry, the person who sold it to you should know. my pearl pied was all white and light gray. no spots, the feathers were white and outlined with gray. congrats on your new friend!|`|1gDTiPVyaa	I don't know enough about cockatiel genetics to answer, but there's probably someone at www.cockatiel.org who can give you an answer--I know that some traits are sex-linked.<br>  <br>  S/he's really cute whichever "it" is. <br>  <br>  As far as sexing by pelvic bones, even my vet can't always tell which it is if the female has never laid eggs.

It only cost $50, though and it's nice to know for sure--they sent it to ZooGen, I think.  Since my little girl is a pearl, the best clue was that she still had barring on her tailfeathers at 4 years old--males normally lose the barring by that age. Not 100 percent of the time, apparently, but usually.
D5wZLk6faa	Let me first say the bubble nest will be as big or as small as the male makes it.<br>  <br>  The previous statement about taking the male out and putting the female in so she can put eggs into the bubble nest is so far from what needs to take place. <br>  <br>  Since he has built the bubble nest have u let the male and female view each other? If you have and she seems as if she is desperately trying to get to him then she is ready for mating. Another indicator is if the female is dark enough u will see vertical stripping on her which indicates she is ready for mating. If she shows no interest in the male at all after being able to view him for atleast two days then you will need a different female as if she is not interested in the male and u put them together and she rejects him, he will kill her. And what I mean by viewing each other is by having her outside of the tank where she can see him or in a funnel type contraption that you will have to make yourself out of a clear bottle and put her in the tank so they can safely view each other without contact safely.<br>  <br>  All the instructions you will need can be found in the link I am providing for you below as it is too much to write in here.<br>  <br>  After reading all the information in the link if u still have questions feel free to email me.|`|37kGM11xaa	My betta is doing it nest to....Maybe it is a sign for a male betta wants a female betta?|`|IBD277uSaa	It means he is happy and that he is done|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	If you're planning one breeding, you'll need to take the male out of the tank, put a female in.

I would put two drops in the infected eye, 1 drop in the other eye every 8 hours for 2 days and then drop down to 1 drop in each eye for the next 3 days if you are certain it is a bacterial infection.<br>  <br>  I just talked to a friend familiar with pharmaceuticals.  She said the usual dosage is 1 drop every 6 or 8 hours for 7 to 10 days.  She said if the infection is severe than use more often, rather than putting two drops at one time.  She said no need to treat the uninfected eye unless it becomes infected.  She said to pull the dogs lower eyelid out to form a pocket and place the drop inside.  She said never touch the dropper bottle to the eye or it will get contaminated.  She also said to wash your hands because it could be something you can spread to yourself.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	If you have human eye drops, you do NOT use them on your dog.<br>  You contact the vet, you get the dog diagnosed properly and you treat the problem properly.|`|mMvgxQ5Naa	Don't give them to your dog if they are for humans it could harm your dogs eyes I suggest that you go to either the vet or a pet store such as Petsmart or Petco|`|lMYuPrhIaa	DONT!!!

b7zwuj4Vaa	You don`t put them into a breeding tank the males will constantly chase the females and they will breed like crazy.<br>  I have a lot of guppy fry about 50 heaps.<br>  Guppies are live bearers. Separate them from the other fish because they will eat them.<br>  Even the parent will eat them.<br>  Feed them fry food(which you can buy from the fish store)4-8 times a day.<br>  When the female guppy is about to give birth she will have a black spot on her stomach called a gravid spot and she will look like she is about to pop.They will have 50-80 fry each batch.<br>  When she is about to give birth put her in a hatcher with a grill to separate her and the fry.So when she gives birth the fry will fall into the bottom and th female guppy won`t be able to eat them.<br>  When she has finished giving birth take the female guppy out of the hatcher then take the grill out.<br>  Hope this helps good luck breeding guppies!|`|pLirJP9Taa	My guppies breeded without me even wanting them to.

Just make sure you get a 'fry basket', a little dipper-shaped basket that fits on the side of your tank.  If you don't separate the generations the big fish will eat the little ones (even the parents).|`|4yt4D3vMaa	Obvious;y your females are very stressed by being in a breeder trap so I wouldn't put them in there-they can abort their fry and even die from the stress. If you get lots of plants and hiding places then you can keep an eye out for fry and net them when you see them and put the fry in the breeding trap until they are a bit bigger-remember to add tank water to the breeder trap every day as the water doesn't circulate well through them.everything else you need to know can be found here <a href="http://www.guppies.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guppies.com/forums/</a> there are threads on guppy breeding and fry care|`|d1XagnYNaa	Just put them together and they will breed.

Y0XYX6Isaa	As good as leopard geckos are, I don't suggest getting one for your son. He is young and all reptiles carry Salmonella. They also loose their tail if it is grabbed hard. They can live to be 20 years old and if your son gets tired of it, it becomes your responsibility to take care of it. <br>  <br>  Several anoles would be good if he wants something to watch. They are active and awake during the day. The down side to them is that they are fast. They don't live as long as leopard geckos either. <br>  <br>  Consider the work for caring for reptiles. They need the proper setup of the tank. It needs to be cleaned at least monthly. With anoles you can have several in a tank. Leopard geckos get stressed. If you have a large enough tank (40+ gallons) a couple females can be put together. Males will fight to the death. <br>  <br>  Do research on whatever you decide on. Books, internet, breeders and store employs. Read how they act, lifespan, cage setup, and what they need to live healthy. Have the tank set up before getting anything. Make sure you have everything. Temperatures set and the tank already decorated. You will need the following for leopard geckos.<br>  <br>  *20 gallon tank: A long one is good, they don't climb very high.*Substrate: Anything from sand to news paper is ok. I don't recommend using sand it is very messy and can cause health problems. *Heating: Do not use a heat rock under any circumstances! They overheat and kill reptiles. Instead use a Under tank heater. They go outside the tank on the bottom. If the tank is not warm enough use a heat lamp of some kind.  *Food: Crickets and meal worms are most common. Wax worms can be used as a treat. They need live food because it is better for them and the movement catches their attention. *Water: They need a shallow dish of fresh water everyday. Clean out the dish a couple times a week it can get slimy.*Vitamins: Keep a dish of calcium in the tank. They will lick from it. Dust their food several times a week. *Decor: They need at least two hides. One on the hot side and one on the cooler side. One needs to have damp moss in it to help the lizard shed. Other then take its up to you how to decorate. Just leave room for them to walk around. <br>  <br>  For anoles you will need the following. Water, food and vitamins are the same for anoles. <br>  *30 gallon tank: They love to climb.*Substrate: You can use bed-a-beast.*Heating: With anoles you need an under tank heater, a basking light and a UVA/ UVB light. They need the UVA/UVB because they are out during the day. Leopards geckos hide and are nocturnal.*Decor: Look for branches are taller things to climb on. They love to climb. *Misting: Anoles tank needs to be misted several times a day to keep the humidity up. A clean spray bottle will work. <br>  <br>  For both leopard geckos and anoles. Wash hands before and after handling and when cleaning. Reptiles carry salmonella in their intestines. Young children and older adults are at risk of diseases as well as those that have compromised immune systems. As long a good hygiene is followed it shouldn't be a huge issue. <br>  <br>  Consider other reptiles such as Bearded Dragons, Blue tongue skink, frogs, other geckos(house, crested), Snakes, and Turtles (require much larger tanks and also more care.) <br>  <br>   I have these things in mine. <br>  *30 gallon tank: Left over when I had anoles.*Substrate: Sand with slate tiles over it. Very easy to clean. No risk of impaction. Looks great.*Heating: UTH with basking light and heat lamp.. *Food: I feed mine meal worms, wax worms and crickets. *Water: I keep a small dish of water in the tank. *Vitamins: I dust crickets a couple times a week and keep a dish of calcium in the tank. *Decor: Two different hides, a bridge he climbs on, fake plants, water dish and calcium dish. <br>  <br>  I have a leopard gecko that I got on my birthday. He is a Leucistic leopard gecko. He has no spots and has a slight whitish color. His name is Logan and is about 2 years old. I've have him 6 months. I got him at the Petsmart store that I work at. About 10 years ago I also had anoles. They were caught wild in Houston, Texas and brought on a plane back to Washington. Then taken back to Houston the following summer and released. I don't recommend wild caught. They had more diseases and are aggressive. Mine fought and bit. <br>  <br>  I don't mean to sound like reptiles are hard or a pain to take care of but you do need to know what you’re doing and what’s involved. Leopard geckos are pretty hardy and are good starter pets. Adult supervision is needed for young children with reptiles. <br>  <br>  If you need any help or have questions you can email me at muramasaaltrigalian@yahoo.com|`|zJeeAPq2aa	To answer your question a leopard gecko is the way to go :)<br>  They're not too big but not too small.<br>  Fairly cheap and don't have tons of requirements to take care of.<br>  They dont' bite<br>  My 8 year old brother is terrified and reptiles and the other day he let my gecko crawl on his shoulders.<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|lNzhglLFaa	leopard geckos and bearded dragons are great.. my only concern is 5 is a little young..

I would like to immediately point out that, while beardies are amazingly friendly, funny, and great pets, they require a lot of work. I spend hours bathing, feeding, watering, and cleaning my bearded dragon every single day. Hours and hours and hours of hard work. Also, they have many special requirements such as the need for UV radiation, in which case you would need a special UV bulb, need for extreme temps over 100* on the basking spot, the need for multiple vitamin and calcium supplements, etc, etc, etc. In short, do not get a beardie unless you have done eons of research and have the time for lots of care.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, I ranted a bit there. I do own a beardie, and he is amazing, but at the same time very difficult to care for.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  About geckos; others have mentioned leopard geckos, and I agree. Leos are friendly, easy enough to handle, and don't require much space or maitenance. Another gecko to consider is a crested gecko, which is a bit smaller than a leo,and is also docile and low maitenance.<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree; expecially for small children, a gecko is the best lizard to start with, and among geckos, leos or cresteds are probably your best options. However, although they are low maitenance, you should do lots of research because they too need certain heat levels, humidity levels, vitamins, etc.|`|McnuekTBaa	I am going to cast my vote for the African fat-tailed gecko.<br>  Their size and care is similar to that of the Leopard gecko, but African fat-tails are much calmer, making them easier to handle, and less likely to jump out of your hand.<br>  You do realize, though, that a five year old won't be able to care for it properly, right? You should plan on being the caregiver yourself.<br>  BTW, lizards are designated as "species" not "breeds".<br>  More info for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/fat_tail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/fat_...</a>|`|goaq5Gwiaa	get him a bearded dragon they grow to be very big and you need a big aquarium tank. they are harmless and eat fruit and crickets.<br>  you can find it any local pets store or pets mart.<br>  get the crickets in the boxes if they have them.(its easier to feed)|`|o66jqnraaa	leopard geckos are so friendly and will never bite ever. i got my little cousin 7 year old one and he loves it just make sure that it is a baby and he loves it because they live for about 15 years.    have fun                 kyle

RPaHObubaa	Try to hold her as much as posible. Even if this means 5 minutes a day or until she becomes unholdable. This will improve her A LOT! Some good treats would be things like cheese (but not too much because it can cause constipation), cerial, and bread. Good luck!!
3BMBZtDxaa	That is just a myth. Fixed dogs have no negative reaction. They only get prevention from having puppies, getting cancers, etc. There is no such thing as dogs getting fat and lazy after being fixed.<br>  <br>  I think your mom needs to do some real research about spaying rather than listening to what comes around on the grape vine! All dogs I've known, I much prefer them fixed. Behavioral issues cease, they become less high-strung, and they tend to have more even temperments. All the spayed dogs I've been around are just as energetic and playful as ones who haven't been and they are perfectly healthy and slim! Just keep her on her exercise regimine and feeding her the food and she'll be just fine. You'll have your same dog just one that isn't as moody, could be easier to train, and doesn't have her period every few months.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FNYEkyqLaa	Sorry that you did not get your dog spayed before it had it first heat.  The health benefits of spaying before the first heat are significant.  But it is never too late and spaying will still have health benefits.  Not necessarily so that females gain weight after spaying.  But if she does then reduce the amount fed.|`|p7swtBYzaa	That's just an old wive's tale -- not true at all.<br>  If you give your dog the right amount of food and the same amount of exercise as before, she will get no fatter after spaying than before.<br>  <br>  Don't believe that nonsense - get her spayed.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	It is not true. Just feed her the same and exercise her the same. Don't worry.|`|5c7569b25d7c5784cb92c0ca179f21bcaa	Overweight is one of the known side-effects from spaying, but it's far from every dog that get weight problems. Should your dog be one of the dogs affected, her weight can be controlled. Simply cut down on her food/feed her diet food and increase her exercise. Just because a dog is spayed, there is no reason for it to get fat, it's all up to the owner.<br>  <br>  If the weight issue is your only concern, I would say go ahead and have her spayed.|`|pT0SFrlFaa	well its just easier for most of them afterwards. but if you make sure she doesn't eat too much and exercises on a regular basis shell be fine. My aunts dog was pure muscle but she then had it fixed and has not changed anything and now the dog is several pounds over weight. but my dog never put on weight at all and she goes for a walk once in a great while. just keep an eye on her and she will be fine.|`|AA10210947	Keep her on a controled diet. Ask your vet how many calories she should have in a day and feed her only that much.  Sometimes dogs do gain weight after surgery but it only because they are beginning to get older and their metobolism slows down.  Ask your vet for more advice|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	That myth about fixed dogs gaining weight is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  If your dog gets the right amount of exercise and a good diet...there is no reason she should become obese.<br>  <br>  *Owner of two neutered and healthy-sized dogs.|`|E3SKXPF1aa	Dogs don't get fat after being spayed. All the dogs I know that are spayed have never NEVER gotten fat. Keep doing the exercise though because otherwise it will get fat. Good luck!!!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	That is so not true.  Dogs get fat if you feed them to much and don't exercise them.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	That's a pathetic myth, don't believe it.

She was spayed about 6 yr ago and never gained an ounce. I have  chi that was less than 3 lb before spaying 4 yr ago but weighs almost 4 lb now. She is not really fat, just solid.|`|GSf09ALBaa	All I can tell you is I have 9 dogs and all of them are fixed.  And not one is even remotely overweight.<br>  <br>  Keep up the same food, exercise etc and your dog will not gain weight.<br>  <br>  Spaying and neutering has nothing to do with weight gain.

hQ6ZqHjzaa	If its the same petshop you got her from then its likely that they could be siblings, but other than that it is probably coincidence. It all has to with genetics and its not uncommon to find two piggies that look alike. My spike who is an abby with ginger dutch markings has many 'twins' who look exactly like him, because ginger dutch markings are very common and people selectivly breed their piggies to get his colouring. I used to have a guinea pig called Slush who sounds just like your piggie, your piggie is tricolour so it is likely that there are many more out there that look like her.|`|RPaHObubaa	If it is from the same pet store, it is VERY possible, what breeders do is that they breed the same female over and over and sell the babies to pet stores. It is quite possible they share the same mother (or anything else) even if it is younger than yours. Hope this helps!!|`|AxqpE3nOaa	It all has to do with genetics.  Although it is unlikely, it is still possible.  The most probable this is that is is from the same blood lines as your guinea pig, but it is quite a remarkable find.|`|3sB49YNnaa	Chances are that if you look REALLY closely, they aren't EXACTLY the same, just very close.  It is quite possible that if they came from the same breeder/pet shop they are related.  Patterning tends to run in lines, particularly in Tortoise Shell and Whites (TSW, Red, Black and White).  In our early years of breeding we had several generations of nearly identical TSW boars, each one sired by his look alike in the earlier generation

F4IjI9qaaa	Unlike dogs which go into heat once a year, cats can have up to 3 litters a year. Yikes!!!<br>  <br>  People are more likely to allow their cats out to roam than dog owners are - this enables them to get in pregnant.<br>  <br>  An unfixed dog is generally not a problem (except for the mess of the female's spotting. An unfixed cat is something awful! They scream and carry on until the owners can't stand in any more and just let them out.<br>  <br>  Feral cats can manage much better than dogs and are usually less noticeable than dogs except where they may gather at night or for food. Because dogs are more social animals, they stay and roam in packs which are more easily spotted and rounded up.<br>  <br>  Most people that want a cat have already adopted one from off the street or outside the grocery store so they're not going to go to a shelter for one.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Cat overpopulation is arguably one of the largest global problems facing animal advocates, as the figures increase annually. In 1996, Sarah Hartwell of the Feline Advisory Bureau wrote: <br>  "Britain has an estimated 7 million pet cats and 1 million ferals. By comparison, the United States has approximately 60 million pet cats and 60 million ferals." <br>  Where do all these feral cats come from? Hartwell goes on to say, "Feral populations are swollen by the breeding and dumping of unwanted pets; 5 million cats and dogs are 'dumped' annually according to the US Department of Agriculture while American surveys suggest that between 36 percent and 60 percent of unneutered pet cats go feral within 3 years." <br>  That unexpected litter of kittens that your neighbor can't get rid of? Your sister's insistance on letting her cat have just one litter so the kids can see the miracle of birth? The man at the office who believes spaying is unnatural and would never do it to his cat? These are the people who are contributing to the feral cat overpopulation problem. <br>  <br>  One problem with adoptions is that kittens are always in the paper for free. They are cute and cuddly. The shelters charge for the cats to require spaying.  They are usually young adults or older.|`|RDsZFfLOaa	because most cats get out more frequently and also there able to get out of a fence easier to|`|HjMbOgvqaa	Well there is so many because of irresponsible owners and because they have so many litters in a year and more than two kittens.
yEUo24Znaa	From opening visit hours until close, and the next day, as well if you prefer. Just let them know you want to spend the day or at least a couple of hours so they can free up a room for you instead of a kennel.  It looks better for you to take more time to decide. Let them know you want the opportunity to really feel out a dog, and even take it for a walk.  KUDOS for rescuing. You are awesome, and the humane society will be happy to work with you!  If not, tell them you are going to the next shelter!|`|43d7bcd8eb6978e1af38224038c541f3aa	When I adopted my dog they let us stay as long as we wanted.

Wo0AWgYVaa	1 year old dog is still a puppy.  If the dog does not get enough stimulation and love, it will become destructive.  I am not saying I am a perfect doggy mom.  I do have a breed as big as yours and probably more hairy than yours, I have a Newfoundland and he is currently 8 mths old.  Since he came home, I did A LOT to develop him.  4 to 5 days a week, he would go to doggy daycare to socialize with his own kind (tired dog is a happy dog), each weekend and my dayoff, I will take him to different places to get exposure...elevator, mall, traffic, etc.  Plus training...he got more toys than any human beings.  Guess what, 6 mths home, he has not chewed any furniture, any shoes, has not broken anything (pretty amazing for a large puppy)...the most he did is stole my socks or my partner's slippers and ran around the house and have us to chase him.  Or shredded the paper in the waste basket (no big deal, it's garbage anyway).  He is not a perfect behaved puppy but I guess because he got so much exercise and love and toys, there is no need for any destructive behaviour.<br>  <br>  Regarding his destroying behaviour, 1. I think he is bored...do you have a dog walker or a doggy daycare facility around.  I highly recommend it.  As mentioned, a tired dog is a happy dog.  May cost $20 a day...but better than destroying your house.  2.  Is he jealous of your child...if he only destroys the baby toy...Personally I don't think dog has the capacity in terms of brain processing to be vindictive.  So I think he probably does not know what toys is his and what toys is your son.  Next time when he chews the wrong toy, say Ah ah with a frown look and say "give"..take the toy away...then get him a bullstix or knuckle bone and say "take it".  Eventually he will learn what is his chew toy and what is the baby toy.  I taught my dog a command "leave it" as well.<br>  <br>  I can sense your dog is your husband's dog...and if you put up a me or the dog thing, it will hurt the relationship.  I think you really should enroll a professional trainer and help you to train the dog (with you).  At the mean time, invest in a dog walker or doggy daycare.  Most dogs will get mellow out after 2 years old.<br>  <br>  A lot of people don't realize a 1 to 2 year old puppy is like a human baby.  Try invest time in him, this dog will grow up be your baby's best friend and protector.|`|QpO1a3b8aa	Perhaps you could enroll him in an obedience school if you had the money. If not, personally training him the right and wrongs. <br>  <br>  For his weak stomach and fur, make sure that you stick to one certain food. Don't give him anything 'different' in texture, taste etc or table scraps. For the fur, comb the dog as often as possible and get him groomed.<br>  <br>  It would be better than seeing him have to go away!|`|d1TTwwUUaa	1st answer your a as-h--- Maybe you need to find this dog a home that wiill enjoy him. You knew about the hair when you got him. That's a hairy dog that you chose. He's destrying probably fron seperation anxiety.

(nobody can get near the baby) <br>  <br>  i havent had any problems with them eating the toys or anything but i would reccommend going to petsmart or some pet place and talking to a trainer to see if they have classes or if they have any tips and tricks for you. i think your pup is jealous that he isnt getting all the attention anymore, make sure you take some time out to give him some loving too!|`|Lat2BDgeaa	Maybe if you loved him a little bit, then he wouldn't be so naughty! WHen you get a dog, your caring after his life, and he's yours. I'm sure he apprecicates the care, even though you don't appreciate his company! My suggestions:<br>  Give him a toy, that way he wont chew other things as much! It may take some time before you find the right toy, we have a box of toys for my dog, and he only plays with a couple, but he does have a favorite. <br>  Brush his hair once a week, at least. This will stop some of the shedding!<br>  Love him up, he is the sweetest smartist dog that exists afterall!<br>  :)|`|RwJW2Us9aa	thats so sad. you liked him before the baby but now you hate him. he just want attention. he will probably stop being so dectrutive after you pay attention to him|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	Well thats not very nice.

Get him some chew toys before you leave for work or whatever fill a kong chew toy with peanut butter and that will entetaine him make sure you take him for daily walks to reduce bordem. The hair you just get used too. Brush him 3 times a week and he should get a little better. And for the diahreah and vomit, suck it up and get used to it.

(Some breeds more then others, you PICKED one that needs extra.)<br>  Dogs don't choose to be in a home where the owners had a baby. <br>  <br>  <br>  YOU chose to get a dog. You should have researched it's breed before you got the dog, with your future of possible children included in that decision. All the things listed about are fairly common, you shoulda thought of that.  <br>  <br>  It took us weeks of reading about different breeds and researching before we got our dog. We kept the possibility of kids in mind when we chose. <br>  <br>  It is up to YOU to make it work. <br>  That dog needs at least 2 45 minute walks a day. <br>  He needs to be groomed daily. (You need to take him to a groomer often to keep him trimmed)<br>  He needs good quality food to cut down on shedding. <br>  He needs training, have a trainer come into your home and teach you how to take care of him. <br>  <br>  Most of all he needs an understanding owner who realizes that it is not HIS fault he is in your home, he could have been chosen by people who don't HATE him and he would be much better off. But you chose him, so make it right. It made a commitment to him and giving him a good life when you adopted him. <br>  <br>  Also, you hate him, because you guys aren't putting the time and effort into a breed that YOU picked out.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	Most people that have dogs is because they need to give away their love to something. You know ; they feel the need to share kindness with someone , but since you have your baby that has been taken away from the dog as well as the attention you used to give. Even if you feel like you give that dog enough attention in that dogs mind it may be negative attention. In a way you have 2 big babies in your house. And that dog is one hell of a huge black sheep lookin’ thing don’t know how I would survive with that but sure feel pity for you. Maybe you should lock that dog up but then that would be way to harsh and mean , I think its best to give him over to a relative , for your sake. Surely your husband will have to agree with you because he loves you more than that canine. Then when that kid is a little older , bring that thing back home. But right now its best to give him up and if no relatives , give to a friend , and if no friend  , then I am so sorry maybe discipline it.|`|R0KEbgJGaa	Send him to a school, and send your dog outside your garden or something.|`|1umOKLqoaa	'Hate' is a very strong word. My dog is very challenging too and he has a weak stomach too. But to tell the truth I have a bond with him now despite the challenges. And sooner or later you sill get use to him. I did, but don't let this dog make your child scared or your husband. Cause if you grunt really loud with anger your husband or Child (At an older age) will get upset. They'll think it's all their fault. So instead of screaming and all that stuff (you sound pretty stressed and you may do that). Just tell your husband about your problems and you can fix it together.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Increase the amount of exercise he gets, and this will help decrease boredom.

The trainer will help a lot.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|IDrnuVcmaa	The first thing you need to understand is that dogs are very in tune to emotions.  If you are having feelings of resentment, he knows it.  He's destroying things related to the baby, right?  Dogs are very smart - smarter than we give them credit for.  He knows that before the baby, you loved him.  After the baby, you were tired, run down, and started to feel badly toward him.  The way he sees it, the baby is what changed things - and it doesn't sound like it's too far from the truth.<br>  <br>  Several things would need to happen to keep everyone (including the dog) in the family happy.  I would talk to your husband.  Level with him - taking care of a baby is a lot of work, and so is taking care of this particular breed of dog.  You need his help.  Every day, the dog should get a good long walk.  Every day, someone should brush him out with a de-shedding brush (this will help immensely with the shedding problem).  <br>  <br>  Walking is like meditation for a dog.  It not only releases built up energy (which can turn into anxiety if it's not released), but it also helps to balance the dogs mind.  Each day, after the walk, you should bring your dog into the room with the baby.  Have him sit.  Then, place a toy or article of clothing of the baby's near him.  If he doesn't go for the toy, pet him and give a treat.   If he makes like he's going for it, quietly and calmly (but firm) tell him no, and return him to a sitting position.  <br>  <br>  Once he can be around the toys without caring to go after them, do this same exercise with the baby.  Start him out in the same room, on a leash (so you can be sure to control him).  He should always be calm around the baby.  As he gets comfortable being around your child, you'll want to praise him, and give him a treat.  Careful though - this praise should be delivered in a calm, almost lullaby type voice.  There should NEVER be excitement around the baby, since your dog is so big.<br>  <br>  Now, you didn't mention him being aggressive toward the baby, but with him going after the things with the baby's scent on it, these excercises will be necessary to prevent any future aggression.  He's jealous - he was your baby, and now he's been replaced.  By walking him, and giving him treats for good behavior around your child, he will balance out, and actually start to like your baby being around - after all, baby equals treats and affection!!!  Biggest thing - watch your energy.  He'll pick up on it, and associate it back to the big change your child made in the house.<br>  <br>  He's still a good dog - make sure he knows it!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|FEfj7sgVaa	DON'T HURT IT LIKE THE IDIOT SAID IN THE OTHER ANSWER!!!<br>   JUST EITHER PUT A ADD IN THE PAPER SO SOMEONE TO BUY IT BUT IF YOU DO THAT MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT THE PEOPLE.

Add a new baby into the mix and you've got a lot of stress going on there - for both you AND the dog.  It's not the dog's fault that there is a little human competing for his attention when he used to get 100% of it.  Of course that's why he's chewing the baby's toys - they are HIS toys in his mind, and that child is an intruder as far as he's concerned.

tOE9KbCKaa	I also had a hermit crab that did that, a long long time ago.  I had done all my research, (read all the books, websites, etc), on keeping a hermit crab as a pet.  I knew that it needed a new shell soon, and did everything that the books told me to do about providing a wide selection of bigger shells.  Its old shell wasn't "too small" yet, according to my research but I thought I better play it safe.  <br>  Then one day he did what your hermit crab is doing.  I also waited a few months, and like you, my crab still appeared to be alive although it ended up being dead.  Still to this day no one has been able to explain what happened or how it died, or how to prevent it from happening again.<br>  I had him for a long time, and he had already changed his shell twice before this had happened.  I am pretty sure that he would have gone into one of the new shells if his was too small, but then I guess I'll never really find out... can't ask him what happened! :)<br>  Wish I could give you an answer, but I wish you the best in this quest for knowledge!|`|AA10936767	The crab is Dead. The crab probably got to big for its shell and got stuck and then suffocated.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Wait, so he hasn't moved in three months? Hello, even crabs can't go that long without food or water! <br>  <br>  And when you touch him or pick him up his legs don't move? <br>  <br>  <br>  He's dead. Him not falling out may be due to a snag in the shell or something- just pull the body out or whatever.|`|sxTeKrjwaa	its a possibility. i would pour water on him and see what he does.
mJUf5cnYaa	Nothing is wrong with your kitty. Cats just like to eat unusual things. Mine likes rubber bands and shopping bags. They don't get high from it, but they do enjoy it a lot, which is why he is purring. He probably does this mostly when you get out of the shower, because you were gone and he was excited you came back out of there. Cats are funny critters....|`|6z4RiIhCaa	well my cat eats paper...... it might just be because he is bored or not that i am trying to scare you but here idk that scared me when i asked why my cat ate paper......<br>  <br>  A cat who chews and eats paper, wood, or leather may have internal prasites who are sucking certain nutrients out of her system. A cat who licks window panes, walls, or cement walkways may be anemic. Chronic intestinal problems and liver and kidney disease will sometimes cause a cat to eat non-food items. In all these situations, see your veterinarian immediately.|`|R93qp2Zxaa	My cat likes all papers, but a new, fresh tissue is the best.<br>  I think it's mostly the way they move.  Like something real, it moves in a little breeze like it's moving all by itself.  Something worthy of hunting.<br>  <br>  And if it's worthy of hunting, it's worthy of eating, right?<br>  <br>  Toilet paper on the roll is their other favorite.  You can unroll it into a huge pile, tear it up, make a mess, and bury yourself in it.  I can't even leave toilet paper out because of it.
m4uDn0ofaa	My male pup always likes every person and dog he meets, even before he was fixed.  He has never been agressive with any other dog especially males.  I think if your dog dislikes male dogs, it's that specific dogs problem not a gender problem.|`|bIaywrBCaa	My males get along fine. The females are always having spats but nothing serious. My 2 oldest males are always"arguing" I call it, fussing at each other, but they get along okay, both just wanna be boss.|`|AA11244754	It's not a matter of "dislike" it's a matter of whose the alpha and being neutered has zip to do with it.  I have a male miniature poodle and my roommate has a male pom and a male wire hair mini schnauzer ALL of whom are neutered.  My dog only acts like he doesn't like the schnauz because he knows that he can bully him but he is trying to be the alpha of the two and the mini schnauz is bigger.  But in this household, like I said all of the dogs are fixed.  But males, neutered or not, have to try to establish their dominance and be the alpha dog.|`|DeUuipSBaa	I have 3 boys. All neutered. They don't like each other except for one... he's a lovable goof ball. Anyways they are pack animals and want to be the alpha male, pack leader. And they don't want them taking their food, masters, females, or home.|`|bJN9WzAjaa	i don't think its the fact that the dog is neutered it may be just that dog thinks its more powerful than the other dog and wants respect from that dog or it could just be the other dog is in that dogs space|`|AA11401901	liberalism is a mental disorder....<br>  obama will destroy this country.|`|YKcNS64faa	male dogs fight because they smell a female and/or dislike each other, they're fighting for the female most likely(the one they smell).
w9aR8ymGaa	unless you bought your puppy from a reputable breeder, you can't expect him or her to be bred to the breed standard as BYBs and mills frequently breed dogs that aren't up to breed standard so you can't expect the pups to be.|`|o93EwErKaa	I prefer Yorkies with erect ears since that is the breed standard.  I really doubt at 10 months old your dog's ears will ever stand.  All the puppies I have bred their ears stand very early at about 8 weeks old.  If your dog has a heavy coat than you can try shaving the hair on the tops of the ears in a V pattern (standard Yorkie grooming).  If it is just the weight of the coat causing them to flop than there is a chance they will stand.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Probably not.<br>  <br>  It depends on what the dog looks like.  I groomed a drop ear yorkie today that looks very cute but if his ears were prick, they would be donkey ears.(too big)   Some yorkies look great with prick ears & some look great with drop ears & how you have them groomed.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	They will probably go up. My yorkies has floppyish ears when they were puppies but they're standing up now. and when they hear something, their ears go BOING! it's so cute!<br>  <br>  i really don't think one type of ear is cuter than the other..they're ears! and they're puppies! they're gonna be cute no matter what their ears look like! <br>  <br>  =D|`|W1UHwwsoaa	My boston terriers ears were like that till she was 6 months old. They may or may not stand up. The vet can fix that with out surgery. I think all dogs are cute no matter if their ears stand up or not.|`|mMvgxQ5Naa	It really depends on if your puppies parents ears where floppy or up|`|rp8DUN9Waa	i think they look cuter with ears down
RPaHObubaa	Yes, even if he was really freaked out it is nothing to be afraid about! When you wake one of your family members up and they wake up scared you don't leave them alone all day. No need to worry! Spend as much time with them as possible when it is not sleeping! Leaving it alone when it is awake will do nothing to help it. No worries! Good luck!! Hope this helped!!|`|TrEDiWR7aa	yes, you just startled him, try to be quiet when entering or exiting rooms, and greet him calmly from now on, but he will be perfectly fine~|`|PaVyuYVUaa	your hamster will be fine. first off, hamsters are nockturnal (not how you spell it i know) and nockturnal means they sleep during the day and are awake at night, if you didn't know. hamsters do make some weird noises at times, don't worry. you probably just startled him, its nothing to worry about. don't worry about waking them up. you can change sleeping patterns so they wake during the day and sleep at night if you pick them up enough during the day. let him sniff you first and if he goes on his back and shows his teeth or hisses DON'T PICK HIM UP! this means he definitely doesn't want to be messed with and will bite if provocted. hope you and your hamster have a good, long, and happy life together and i hope this helps|`|7NFiwGrjaa	Yes, he will be fine. He probably just sneezed or something. Hamsters sneeze a lot and get scared easily. Don't be surprised if it happened again. BTW, When you have freetime around 8-9, play with him.|`|QI5RoBXnaa	Yes your hamster will be fine.  Hamsters are nocturnal, which means they sleep during the day and are active at night.
OBh7uEd1aa	i understand what you are going thru. i have a boxer that does the same thing. give the dog 1 benadryl pill.  and take her to the vet in the morning. they will give her a shot. and also tell you to keep giving the benadryl. you need to keep a very close eye on her because it can get very bad. mine got so bad that she got welps all over her body and dehydrated. she had to be rushed to the vet and i almost lost her. but the vet will give you meds. to get it undercontrol. mine has been like this since i got her and you might want to get them to test her for red mange. because thats how ours started. if you have any questions please let me know. make sure you get benadryl allergy. do not get any other brand it can harm the dog.|`|ktC40jtXaa	Well im sure she will be fine untill you take her to the vet. It almost looks like ringworm. I hope she gets better and the rash goes away :)|`|RqeoCyzYaa	she needs to go to the vet, that looks like its getting infected. she sure is having a allergy reaction to something maybe flea soap, raw hide which my pit bull has. not pig ears but raw hide.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Depending on where you live, it could an environmental allergy.<br>  My female has an allergy to grass and pine straw believe it or not!<br>  It could also be a food allergy, have you recently changed her food?<br>  Another thing is the shampoo you have bathed her with, the area you are showing would be difficult to rinse when a dog is standing, it could be that or laundry detergent that her bedding has been washed in....<br>  <br>  Just some suggestiong, I have been there!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	One of our females had a rash and it was because the shelter used the same needle on her and a few other dogs. UH. <br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell you, if shes going to the vet tomorrow it should be fine overnight.|`|LJ9hyvg2aa	give her some allergy meds and see if it clears up. don't bathe her and just go to the vet|`|gse1455saa	Looks raw.  Bet is hurts|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	I took a look at your photos and it looks pretty nasty.<br>  <br>  I know you made a comment about your other dog trying to "get some"<br>  but I feel like I see a fresh spay scar. My eyes may be playing tricks on me but was she recently spay. If the answer is yes these could be hot spots from continuously licking her incision and around it. <br>  <br>  I guess if I had to make a guess I would say it's some sort of allergic rash or hot spots. (I'm really leaning toward the hot spots exspecially if she has some kind of sore on her stomach)<br>  <br>  Let us know what it was I'm real curious. Good luck!

QrjjiOgTaa	silver dollars might go after java ferns and any plant, i saw it before. do not cycle with them, or any tetra, they are sensitive. get 3, they can grow quite large and its not even a 30 gal tank.|`|nAK8bm91aa	I'm going to make like I did not read the others.<br>  After having silver dollars, I find that plastic plants are best.<br>  One fish for every gallon of water is the rule of thumb. I would not buy a school of silver dollars no matter how nice they look. I would however buy at least 2 of each type of fish you put into the tank. Silver dollars keep to them selves mostly. Purchase a plecostomus pleco for short, he will eat all algae.|`|wLbXsvAKaa	You could only fit 3 silver dollers in that tank but may not be able to add anymore fish because they get very large.<br>  <br>  A small school should have atleast five fish but you coldnt have over 3 in that tank.<br>  <br>  I have never had silver dollers eat my plants in my 90 gallon and jave fern is easy to care for because it dosent need much light.<br>  <br>  It you wanted other fish with your silver dollers I would get a fifty gallon, but if you just want the silvers 29 is OK.<br>  <br>  you might be able to cycle the tank with those fish But i wouldnt to be safe|`|NHs3LxlLaa	3 Maybe.<br>  <br>  Java Fern is good<br>  <br>  50 Gal+ will let you have a good sized school of them<br>  <br>  Yes but I'd recommend fish less cycling<br>  <br>  Also, I don't think you should have them at all really. Tank seems a bit small.
MfcTIdlraa	You keep the dog.  Just tell the roommate that she doesn't take care of it and you have done so twice.  If she gets upset, tell her, "fine, you can move out, but leave the dog because I care about it more than you do!"  If it's registered with the AKA ask her to sign the dog over to you.<br>  <br>  You are a good soul for taking care of the dog as you are doing.  Angels are waiting for you, stars in your crown! !|`|gwUMipsUaa	Honestly, I would just tell her since she does such a crappy job of caring for this dog, that you are going to give it to a shelter once you took it to the vet tomorrow.  Or tell her you will license this dog in your name if she doesn't start taking better care of this dog.<br>  <br>  You'll lose a "friend" out of this, but trust me, you haven't lost anything valuable here.|`|PM23RDycaa	Keep the dog ditch the friend. Tape photos of the dog before you take her in tomorrow. General condition and the problem areas - ears and the split toe. Keep copies of the vet records tomorrow. <br>  <br>  If you can try talking her into selling you the dog.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Just take the dog to the vet and don't even mention it.|`|RqeoCyzYaa	i would face your friend and tell her that she needs to give the dog to a loving home like yours and if she don't your turning her into the dog pound. we all have to take  are dogs to the vet.you sound like a good human being. give her a choice give the dog to you so you can get it help are turn her nasty a-- in. shes a animal abuser the troll. help that dog.|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	THAT NAIL WILL FALL OF IN ANOTHER WEEK AND IT WILL BE FINE BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR ISSUES ARE WITH HER LIVING WITH YOU AND YOU ARE PUTTING IT ON THE DOG.

DON'T GET ME WRONG I WAS WORRIED THATS WHY I CALLED MY VET...YOU SOUND VERY CONTROLLING MAYBE THAT IS SOMETHING SHE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT TOO...|`|98p5v51zaa	You can report this anonymously to the SPCA or local animal control. They will visit the home and inspect the dog. If your friend cannot afford or just doesn't want to care for the dog they will make arrangements to have it cared for and adopted. You can also make arrangements to adopt the animal, but you would be required to pay for the required vet visits and would be obligated to show proff before final adoption is granted.|`|Gs0jtsebaa	You should keep the dog. Poor thing!!! Your doing the right thing by taking it to the vet. But yeah do what ppl above me said. call in anonymously.|`|AA11648899	You're not her preacher, you're not her teacher, you're certainly NOT her parent.<br>  <br>  If the dog is in danger - just call the SPCA - Anonymously.|`|Kg5KX432aa	call animal services anonymously. Your friend will never know it was you and you're doing the right thing for the poor dog|`|ixOE0onnaa	just only keep her|`|bI7wMCJXaa	You need to contact the ACO for your town and report your friend, who will most likely not be your friend after. If she surrenders the dog or the dog is seized because she refuses to care for the dog make sure you let the ACO know that you are interested in adopting her and s/he will let you know the steps you need to take.<br>  <br>  Make sure you get a detailed vet report, take photos, etc, to show the ACO. Vet care can make a huge difference for a dog in spirits and appearance so you need to carefully and thoroughly document everything.<br>  <br>  Thank you for wanting to step up and care for this dog. Amazing how Pit Bulls are portrayed as vicious and evil dogs but even after being horribly neglected will still be loving dogs.|`|oXNgstLYaa	If she is your friend, you should be able to be open and honest with her. Just explain to her that the poor dog needs more attention, and that you are willing to provide that for the dog. You can go about it a way that will hopefully not make her feel bad, but just be honest. Also, if you really want the dog to be in your home, then try asking your friend if you can take the dog for a couple days(say its a play date for your dogs to get together!) and just see how it goes. Maybe she won't even ask for the dog back, especially once she sees how happy it is at your house with your other dogs and more attention!|`|qLBU4t9Zaa	Seems like the best thing you can do is sit her down and explain to her what she needs to do in order to provide a good home for the dog and extend your offer to her..let her take it in and think about it.  Explain to her that if she feels she cannot provide for the dog anymore than her best option would be giving the dog to you because in that case the dog will be healthy, happy, and she can always see it when she wants instead of having the dog taken away and having a record for animal abuse and never being able to see it again.<br>  <br>  And also, the dog's ears are infected without a doubt.  But when you take it to the vet you will get medicine to clear it up.  Thank you and good for you for taking action.|`|ip6yFmC2aa	You can call animal services in your area, because this sounds like animal neglect. She should not be allowed to own pets if you cannot afford their medical care. Legally, thats the best option for you other then talking to her parents and reasoning with them you let you keep the dog.|`|0s2ds5guaa	If you want to keep it, just tell her how much you really like and want this dog. Maybe you could even offer her some money for the animal. And that would help her out in the long run. I don't see why she shouldn't let it go to someone who might actually care about it.|`|65KmxPdTaa	i agree with what the other folks said. you need to call someone but be careful who you call because they could just end up taking the dog to the pound or something. check with any local rescue groups. good luck!|`|EzLP6Jahaa	DON'T TAKE the dog to the vet without her permission - you could get sued, even though it's the right thing, and she can't afford to sue anyways.<br>  <br>  Call the animal control..|`|7KGXRu19aa	Don't call the authority on her.  That will just make things more difficult.  Just let her know that you are very concerned about her Pit.  Get some books or videos on Pitbulls.  Let her know that you cant ignore your dog.|`|G9831g5Baa	Be a *****, tell your friend she needs to take care of the dog or you are taking the dog from her.|`|tQ4QlE8Waa	Cut the nail but not too deep and band aid the wound|`|IiH2zLlkaa	that is just rong call the local aspca and tell them what happened and if they take the dog well thats ur friends falt|`|LAyigK5Aaa	First of all you did the right thing by making an appointment for the vet. I think you need to sit down with your friend and have a little talk. that is REAL abuse! Get that dog help now! Mention to your friend that maybe you can take the dog. Or if you are too shy just take the dog to the vet and don't tell your friend. you will still get good karma!
Fb5YtlkEaa	Its an old hick tale as I call it when people think a horse laying down means problem. He is laying down to nap or enjoy himself in the sun. ALL HORSES LAY DOWN. It is a sign of comfort. The myth of them crushing their gut or squishing them is no more true than if you laid on your stomach. This horse is fine.<br>  <br>  A coliced or stomach sick horse will do something much different than simply lay down. A coliced horse will trash, turn to look at his belly, kick his belly, roll around violently, become lethargic, stiffen, and may even vocalize his pain. <br>  <br>  Your horse is merely enjoying himself, taking a nap, and soaking up the rays. Horses may even lay flat and sleep (the ultimate sign of comfort) The horse should stand up when you go to him and he should stand up quickly. Older horse's may lay down but have some trouble getting up. Know the difference between slow and struggling. Usually if the horse is old and weak he will not lay down if he knows he can't get up. so if your horse is older and slow to get up i wouldn't worry either.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	If he was colicing he wouldn't be so relaxed and something would've already happened if this is something he does alot. <br>  <br>  I know of a horse that lays flat on her stomach, like shes dead (people have stopped at this persons house to ask if their horse is dead).|`|00ad97897648101cc10f52e12966697daa	There are a lot of variables to consider.  Is it nap time when you see him laying down?  my horses usually crash around 11 am. after a big breakfast and sleep for an hour or so.    Is he old?  I have several old horses who spend a lot of their day in bed.  <br>  Does he toss?  Is he thrashing around?  Biting at his belly?  Those are symptoms of colic.   <br>  <br>  If he seems comfortable and relaxed - he's chilaxin!.|`|4MxCAm6gaa	I would say that he's just a lazy ***. He'll be fine.
9auKzop0aa	Lol, sounded kind of funny..<br>  <br>  If your being serious, the only possible way to find it is put rat scent or something..<br>  <br>  That's the easiest way, besides looking all night.|`|Uhbf27hzaa	wow this cant be good tell me how it turns out|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	are you fucl<ing serious?!? duuuuuuuude where???|`|McnuekTBaa	Snakes, especially little ones, tend to dehydrate quickly when they are loose in the house, and will therefore seek out a moist hiding place. That is why escaped snakes are often recovered from bathrooms or piles of laundry.<br>  Set a few damp towels in strategic locations along walls. If the snake encounters one, it is likely to stay put for a while.<br>  Baiting it with food, or with a heat lamp, will probably not work.<br>  I also recommend that you buy an actual snake cage. Many dealers are on kingsnake.com.<br>  Aquariums with removable tops aren't escape proof.|`|hOa5b4pyaa	My ball python escaped one me once, heres what you do. Set up a heater on a side of the room with its favorite shelter, the snake will look for warmth and secutiry if that doesn't work get its normal food, ecept live like a mouse put the mouse in a mouse cage on the floor.<br>  <br>  This happened to me once, My ball python came out when i was feeding my other snake...my cat found it. the cat sat on the snake and both watched the mouth neither was hurt.|`|f12MT3Rwaa	tell the staff! it'll eat the gerbils! set food out for it! and it'll come i guess but GEEZ!!|`|32uZ9JGdaa	uh oh|`|0QKEW5lRaa	rattle a rattle if it's a rattle snake
8Ymsx4Oraa	What? REword the Q.
FNYEkyqLaa	You obviously do not know what you are doing.  Guard dogs are highly trained dogs.  It takes many months and thousands of dollars to train them.  What you get is a dog that is only aggressive on command and can be controlled by commands at any time.  What you are suggesting is a dog that is aggressive all the time and will charge anyone, can't be controlled.  I smell law suit in that situation.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Dogs have a natural instinct to protect its territory or its pack.  So when the bond starts to develop, the protective instinct will come out.<br>  <br>  What I am worried about about your question is you have not thought about the consequence.  An aggressive dog is not a good guard dog.  This morning, one of yahoo members told us her house insurance got cancelled because her rottweiller nipped her friend's hand when they were in teh backyard..this is minor, how about being sued?<br>  <br>  So if you want a guard dog, you need to enroll  a professional guard dog trainer....basically your dog will NEVER NEVER bite or attack unless commands are given.|`|TBQK3RM1aa	First of all, a proper guard dog isn't aggressive. And secondly, if you want a good guard dog you need to train it to react to certain people, like your friends. If you want him/her not to attack your friends then you need to reassure him/her that they're ok. Reward good behavior, and don't make your dog a walking ball of aggression.|`|UTugWDsFaa	aggressiveness is not a trait you want in a guard dog, you won't be able to control it. If you want something to guard you or your house, get an alarm system and some mace...
bZhIEy1Waa	Don't put scissors anywhere near a pup - they move so quick you'd end up cutting one! all you need to do is pinch the membrane surrounding the pup with your thumb and forefinger and pull it away gently, a bit like skinning a chicken! Then, rub gently but vigorously with a clean, dry towel paying attention to its mouth - they'll lose a bit of mucus from there as well. Once the pup is breathing and wriggling lay on its mum's belly so that it can feed - that 1st feed is vital, they must have it! You should only ever interfere, ever, if mum isn't coping or isn't interested in what she's just given birth to - human interference should be the very last resort! Good luck.|`|PM23RDycaa	the mother should be breaking/eating the sack off the pups, cleaning them and chewing the cord on the pups. If she is not moving to do so you have to break the sac off the pup's head so it can breath.<br>  <br>  and please don't say you are in the middle of dealing with your dog in labor. If you are get off the computer and call a VET to talk you through this|`|0b1fa9ca19ef34843cb9155776450abaaa	The sack should break as the pup is born, but if it doesn't, then you can break the sack around the pups mouth so that it can breath, then just give the pup to the mother to clean. DO NOT break or pull the umbilical cord, let the mother do it, if you need to, make sure you tie the cord of in 2 places and then cut in between the ties with sterile scissors.|`|TmUQbODJaa	No- don't break it! Take a towel and gently rub it off. Don't let scissors any where near a puppy- unless you can keep it in a high place and keep them sterilized- far away!<br>  Breeding is not my forte, I can only help a little bit. You can cut the umbilical cord, though.<br>  Congrats on your puppies!|`|A9j7ahwsaa	don't cut i tear it with your fingers then rub the pup with a towel to stimulate breathing,. pinch the umbilical cord with you thumb and forefinger, to stop any bleeding|`|E3SKXPF1aa	Don't cut like snip snip. Break it though!!! You must or they'll suffocate!!! Have fun!!!
J3JClsuQaa	I might take her back to the pound for them to look at her.  Not sure, but looks like the operative wound could be infected.  Either take her back to the ppl that spayed her or to the vet.  Good luck... she will be okay  : )|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Looks like a herna (basically, that is part of the gut you see poking out). If you poke it, and have it go back in the lump is squishy, and not hard.<br>  <br>    90% of the time, they are just a cosmetic thing, and do not need to be dealt with for health reasons.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned with how she looks with it cosmetically or if her behavior, eating habits, etc changes, I would bring her in to the vet. It is pretty easy to fix.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	I might be wrong, you should have a vet check it to make sure. But that looks just like a hernia ~ often found in small dogs bred in puppy mills.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Something that your vet should look at.  I don't think it is serious but certainly needs to be addressed by a vet.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	It is a hernia or hematoma, which can occur after a spay surgery. I would let your vet who did the surgery know, but it should be fine. Usually they occur if the skin shifts around near the suture area or if a bit of blood seeps out in the same area. It will eventually go away in a couple of days. Try to keep the puppy quiet and calm during this time. (As much as you can keep a  puppy calm and quiet!)|`|TmUQbODJaa	Looks like a tumor- Not much can I can do here. Take her to your vet ASAP. Some dogs with tumors can develop cancer, and you must stop it as soon as possible. Keep her comfortable in a warm, dry place. Her food should be given to her in a lesser amount, and drizzled with water. <br>  Get her to the vet. Your dog's lifemay be at risk.<br>  Good luck!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	We had a dog spayed at the shelter and she had problems because they were using the same needle on several dogs. <br>  <br>  If its a bump, its probably because she had an allergic reaction to the stitches.|`|MaDN7knJaa	Try going to the vet.  Maybe you can call the vet. It might be in trouble.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Alyssa|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Not sure, but I am sure that you want to take her into the vet and have it checked out.|`|gse1455saa	Looks like a hernea.  Sometimes babies get these as well.  It will not go away by itself.  Get him to your vet|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	When they are spayed, there is stiches on the inside and stitches on<br>  the outside.. Because the outside is healed, doesn't mean that the<br>  inside is entirely healed and the inner stitches have dissolved yet. It is hard to tell with such blurry pictures, but I suspect it's still healing on the inside.. Did you have the stitches removed, make sure that they are all gone ? If it seems like a problem, then you should take her back to your vet..|`|bZhIEy1Waa	That's the worst case of bad veterinary stitching i've seen! Where the cut was made hasn't been stitched properly and it looks like either a hernia or part of the womb trying to escape through the op site!!! Shocking practise. You need to take her your own vet as soon as you can so that it can be fixed sooner rather than later, it could cause a lot of problems for her, as well as bad pain if its not sorted now. It's not your fault at all so please don't feel bad about it, you've come on here and asked and are prepared to fix it but you do have recourse with the shelter that spayed her - its neither your fault nor hers that she has to now undergo further surgery to rectify their mistakes and shoddy practise - claim all costs from them - they should have paid attention to her op site during and after surgery!!! Good luck.
GSf09ALBaa	Not at all.  You don't even have to change it to something that sounds like Hooch.  I have 8 rescues.  I changed most of their names.  They catch on really quick when you use a treat in conjunction with saying the name.  I would use their name, let's use Hooch.  Then I would follow it up with the name I am changing it to.  Such as HoochGator, come.  Then start using just the Gator with a treat.  <br>  <br>  It works.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Not very. My aunt changed their dog's name when he was a year or so old. From "King" to "Guinness." They were told to tack the new name on after the old so the dog got used to hearing both. Then to gradually stop saying the old name - every time the dog reacted they were to give a treat or offer a toy.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Very simple. Just start using the new name regularly. There shouldn't be any confusion on the dog's part at all. I have easily changed names of dogs I have adopted. In fact, the dog might like the new name to give him or her a fresh start in a new home. He may attach the current name with the shelter. He might like a new name in his new home!|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Dog names are very easy to change.<br>  <br>  All you need to do is relate the name to them. Dogs never really know their name, they just know a word relates to them. So if you use another name and use it often and praise him when he responds, then he'll get it just fine!<br>  <br>  Honestly, though, some animals don't learn their names until 6 months later. It took our cats a LONG time. Well, not our male, but our female.<br>  <br>  My cousin's rescued dog, on the other hand, learned her name very quickly and now responds really well to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11703652	It's super easy!!  Just use the new name consistently- and A LOT!  Besides, if the dog is coming from a shelter, they may have just "given" the dog a name, and she may not answer to it anyway.  Every dog I have adopted has been a stray, so we never knew what it was called before anyway.  Good luck, and thank you for doing a good thing!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	You can re train it to another name. <br>  <br>  Get some treats and say the name over and over then give the dog the treats. It might take time but its not a big deal, all of my dogs are more or less called by nicknames, they still come to me.|`|XavY3fiWaa	You could probably change the dogs name.  When you change her name just have her learn it by getting her to sit in front of you and say the her new name and if she looks up at you give her a treat, keep repeating that.  Just do that a few times a day and she will learn that thats her name.|`|n46bdwUqaa	Not hard at all, just keep the begining of the name the same. I adopted a dog named Rumble and renamed him to Rocky. He likes it just fine and answers to it. The first couple of times were tricky but use a dog treat and it will come along quickly. Good luck!|`|MaDN7knJaa	Not much.  I have tried to change my cat's name back to what it was when i got him and it did not work, but dogs might be a little different.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day,<br>  Alyssa

Black Magic, Majestic, Puma, Charm, Egypt, Eclipse, Ninja, Cleopatra, Jetta and Jet are all very unique.

C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hi. Each month we pay about $25.00 for Canadae dog food. The vet bill is about $150.00 per year for shots, tests and check up. I think it would depend on where you live though. We are in the middle of nowhere so are at the mercy of local vets. In a bigger city there is competition so prices may be lower.<br>  Please keep a shelter pet in mind :)|`|bIaywrBCaa	Minimal cost per month, really depending on the size. For instance a large breed dog eats a lot more so food cost would be higher than for a chihuahua. A chihuahua, maybe $!0 a month for food plus toys, heartworm meds, Frontline for fleas and ticks, etc. Maybe $50 a month tops.|`|YKcNS64faa	depends on what breed of dog, examples: if you get a shiba inu about 300$ Golden retriever 300$ it just depends on the breed of dog you want.|`|746YLjISaa	It depends how big the dog is if it's a large dog 100-300 if it;s small 100-250. GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|QgeLqVSRaa	The first month we had our dog.... $800!!!!!!!!!!  We had to pay for all his shots, deworming, food, medicine because he got sick over a certain brand of food, crate and sooooo much more.  Now we pay about... MAYBE 100
zlVqLur4aa	Cedar emits phenols which are toxic to small animals and birds. It causes respiratory problems and also causes an abnormal rise in their liver enzymes. Pine has the same effect though not a severe as cedar. The best wood to use is aspen.|`|aBLYU5FKaa	Thea is correct.  Wood shavings cause respiratory problems.  They also can cause problems because baby chicks tend to eat the shavings, which can cause internal damage.  I use hay and it works good.  <br>  <br>  Are these baby chickens or some other baby bird like a parakeet.  If they are chickens, you need to wait until they are almost completely dry.  This can take up to a day.  They don't usually eat food or drink anything for two days, because before they hatch they ingest the yolk from the egg, which keeps them full.<br>  <br>  Be sure to have the brooder set up before they hatch.  Set the heat lamp up at least a day or two before the expected hatch date, and watch the themometer to make sure it is stable and the correct temp (95 degrees F).  You can touch them as soon as they are dry, but try to keep the number of people handling them to a minimum, because you don't want them to get sick.  Remember to wash your hands before and after handling them.  Watch for poop on their butts, and if they get any, take a wet towel or damp toilet paper and gently wash it off.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

20lFo07jaa	Call animal control and report it, and have them pick up the cat and take it to the shelter so it has a chance of being adopted.  Make sure to write down a description of the person you saw so you don't forget.|`|ZNkqTVS5aa	It sounds like it.Try and rescue the cat, if possible. Try and find it a home if you can't keep it yourself.|`|kArnjho7aa	What you witnessed was a person who forgot that when he brought this  little thing home, he made a lifetime commitment to love and feed and take care for this beautiful creature and the cat would give all of itself in unrequited love and trust.<br>   Well I am sure the cat never broke it's commitment so you are witnessing human failure at being humane.|`|x6uaGeEEaa	Some people are heartless.<br>  If you can pick the cat up and bring kitty to the shelter or take home if you like to adopt kitty. if not, take poor kitty to the shelter or RSPCA so that kitty can have a home where kitty is loved and wanted.<br>  Good luck..|`|9979ffdb923a5865cbf89c5394015111aa	why didn't you try and get the cat?

AA11168707	Sounds like lice or mites to me.  It's very common this time of year and they are carried by birds so it's really easy for them to pick it up.  Fortunately humans can not get the same type of lice or mites that goats get so there is no need to worry about that.  However, if one of your goats has it they likely all do, even if they aren't showing symptoms.  <br>  <br>  They are easy to get rid of.  A good sprinkle with Sevin garden dust will take care of the problem.  If you haven't wormed your goats lately you might consider worming them with Ivomec injectable cattle wormer.  Ivomec will take care of internal AND external parasites.  For goat I give 1cc of Ivomec per 50 pounds, and administer it orally instead of injecting it.  I usually worm with Ivomec every spring and don't have a problem with lice, however I dust with Sevin if I happen to see any symptoms at other times of the year.  I also dust any new goats coming in.  If his front legs are as bad as you say, you can dip them in bleach water to kill any parasites instantly.  <br>  <br>  Of course there is the possibility that he just has dry skin problems also.  If that's the case, dabbing the areas with tea tree oil to help keep them moist will help heal the areas.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	He could just be shedding weird or have some type of skin irritation.

2cd19255172addb8c0d1980cdc7ec1c8aa	That's the only thing that they would test on animals, is the taste.  They have to know if the animals like the product, or no one would buy it.

The company has to know if the product is going to be liked.|`|qdTkeZyBaa	Your concern about animal testing is very admirable! PETA has a list of pet food brands that do not test on animals on their Iams Cruelty website (1--see below). We feed our five dogs Nature's Variety along with Missing Link (a supplement), and they are doing great.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to find other products (such as cosmetics or household cleaners) that do not test on animals, check out the PETA website (2). It has tons of information about animals and things we can do to help them. <br>  <br>  To the people who don't understand why Iams deserves to be boycotted, see the Iams Cruelty website (3). Here's an excerpt:<br>  --------<br>  For nearly 10 months in 2002 and early 2003, a PETA investigator went undercover at an Iams contract testing laboratory and discovered a dark and sordid secret beneath the wholesome image of the dog- and cat-food manufacturer: dogs gone crazy from intense confinement to barren steel cages and cement cells, dogs left piled on a filthy paint-chipped floor after having chunks of muscle hacked from their thighs; dogs surgically debarked; horribly sick dogs and cats languishing in their cages, neglected and left to suffer with no veterinary care. <br>  --------<br>  <br>  Uncaged is another website that exposes Iams' invasive, painful and lethal experiments on animals (4).

gqjrBmu1aa	You won't be able to unbend those areas of the saddle- that happens when a saddle is left in hot weather for a long time or is not properly cared for such as being oiled, cleaned, and put on a saddle rack.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do for the saddle is start putting it on a saddle rack with a cover over it to prevent further weathering. Also I would go ahead and wash the saddle with saddle soap and then oil it down to condition the leather. You can use vinegar or any rust remover to make the riggings look like new, other than that you can replace them by going to your tack store or saddle repair shop and request them. <br>  If you want the fringing you may be able to buy them but you may have to make them. If you don't want to replace the fringe you can always decorate the saddle with conchos which are cheap and easy to put on the saddle.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Skirts are really hard to uncurl.  You could try, but I don't think you will have much success.  The riggings, rosettes, and strings can be easily replaced at a local saddle shop.  For everything it shouldn't cost you more than $45.00.  You can find a good leather latigo strap for your girth for around $15.00.<br>  Now you say you need new fenders and a skirt.... I think you need a new saddle, sorry.  I think it would be easier and cheaper in the long run.|`|iGeFmo7Yaa	As for the rolling leather edges, you may be able to work these back with alot of saddle oil and massaging it in. The rosettes for the ties are really cheap and most tack stores have them.  You can buy new latigo leather for the cinch, about 25 dollars...the d rings can be replaced as well for a nominal price.

Also- some cats are allergic to catnip.|`|hIrBZS3oaa	YES!!!! I have 2 cats. They both love catnip, but one reacts very badly to it. My male cat has never been able to handle the "high" they get from it.  Just like some people can't handle alcohol and get bad reactions from it.  My cat gets so confused on the stuff, that he pees out of the litter box (which he never does), walks into things and vomits.|`|Vxbywa0maa	It could be. I would keep cat away from it and see if it gets better. If it doesn't, call the vet. Usually by the time you see symptoms in a cat it is very sick.|`|CHzEaMwyaa	your cat could have gotten sick from a lot of things.|`|E9kpNZnnaa	yes if your cat ate too much of it.. my mom's friend had a cat that literally 'od'ed' on catnip.. she had to go to vet and they gave her medicine to make her throw it all up..

4d1d301655e6e50eb5f88b1fcd75c501aa	You really can't stop a dog from shedding.  Certain breeds shed a lot more than others.  You can really only control it somewhat.  Try brushing him/her on a daily basis, this will gather a lot of the loose hair and keep it from getting on your clothes, the sofa and everywhere else.|`|AA12033321	you can't stop a dog from shedding, but grooming will cut down on the hair that gets all over everything.|`|AE6rBMUQaa	Shave 'EM bald so that they have no hair left!|`|0xJZJggVaa	You can't.
0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	When a saddle is correctly fitted you should be able to fit a riding crop (lik the ones showjumpers use) along the horses back, beneath the saddle when there is someone sitting on the horse.  <br>  The width of the tree depends largely, i believe, on the brand of GP (general purpose) saddle that you try.<br>  Bear in mind that depending on the type of work you are doing with your horse she may become more or less muscled over the back and withers.  This will cause the saddle to fit differently over time.<br>  My best advice to you is to have a professional saddler come out and fit saddles to your mares back, he/she will be able to advise you on which tree size would be best.<br>  There is a make of saddle that we get here in South Africa called the Wintec, im sure you probably get a similar make in the States,  the Wintec has adjustable trees, so as your horse becomes more muscled (or less) the tree can be removed and replaced with a different size. You can even do this yourself (removing the tree).<br>  And, just as a point, it isnt a general rule that Thoroughbreds have higher withers than that of a QH, they come in all different sizes.  I have owned TB's my whole life, and personally think they're the most versatile breed on the market.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped you, happy riding!:)|`|7c4b699d45ff7ccd628e6b9f2c83b4a6aa	If you can afford it, you should definitely get a saddle fitting, because a saddle pinching the withers can really affect your horse's performance. Otherwise, if you have a locally owned tack shop, they'll usually let you borrow the saddle to try it on your horse, and even sit on it on her. A wither pad probably would help, but don't get one with a lifted back. That would tilt the saddle forward, and probably make the problem worse. Good luck with english, there's a lot to learn when you switch disciplines!|`|8d06c2f58ad86531d7773c9ff215177faa	I had the same problem with my TB gelding.  If you get a wider tree, it will actually make the saddle rest even more on the withers, do regular would work.  If you are not sure, some tack stores will come and do a saddle fitting for you.  You could always get a saddle that had interchangeable trees(Windtek, or Bates...depending on budget)  I always used a gel pad also, but a riser could help.  My gel pad worked fine.  Esp if you are used to a QH, it will absorb any bobbles you may have while you are still getting used to her.  Hope this helps|`|b95a886d1220943550325eaebe4b411caa	I'd get a saddle fitter if you can afford it.  You don't want to make her sore on her withers or even cause fistulus withers because of poor saddle fit.  One option may be either a Wintec or Bates saddle because they have interchangable trees.  You may also need a custom tree.  Don't be surprised if the fit of the saddle changes when she muscles up.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend a pad with high withers (raised or cut out) so nothing presses on them.  Real sheepskin half-pads can also really help fit a saddle to a difficult horse if you can't afford a custom tree.  Watch for any pressure points.  <br>  <br>  A good way to check saddle fit is to have your horse dirty (dusty, not muddy) and simply use a thin white cloth as a saddle pad.  The markings on the cloth should be evenly dirty, if some spots are dirtier than others it's a good indication the saddle does not fit properly.
AA12034072	What breed are they? Did you plan the breeding? If so then you should really find out as much as you can about breeding and it would be best to make sure you have buyers or you could get stuck with puppies you don't want. <br>  Remember the whelping box won't keep them long & you will need something bigger. I bought a puppy playpen from petsmart (online order only) and I love it! It's under $100 & perfect for bedtime or when I'm not home. 1 side & the top have a zipper for letting Mom in & out. The bottom pad and the plastic bottom come out so you can clean it easily then I put an old towel on the pad & 4-5 layers of old sheets, pillow cases and towels. Fortunately they are extremely intelligent & are weaned (mommy's choice) and pee pad trained.  I have 6 babies now. The playpen has room for them & toys. They'll be 6 weeks old in 2 days. <br>  Good luck with your pups|`|a2bec451e9cd3b8cd1204b35638e8bc9aa	ur welcome! lol j/k i didn't get on this morning, but good luck with the potty training!! especially the little boys ; )|`|ab7dbf179cc2e515b1f429686c7f2ef5aa	AWWWWWWWWW.. adorable|`|e30dbdcaf4e2cf9bcbfcc54bc1c60a1caa	i just got a golden retriver puppy...good luck with the potty training|`|f6ecd3c66fedef73b16d3510881b47f6aa	Now go get your dog Spayed!!!!<br>  to many homeless animals die in shelters everyday!|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	Congratulations!

AA12108695	It is not your fault. It is just how natural life cycle works. It was a good thing you let it outside and squirrels have predators and that is how life works. It would not be the cats fault either because, like i said, It is how life of animals work. They live, they die. Cats need prey too and did not know it was yours.|`|4ZVUA95Baa	It isn't your fault.You were doing the right thing letting it go outside.If you had cooped it up in the house , it would have become paranoid.It is probably whoever was at home at the time or your cats fault because the squirrel did its thing outside while you were being responsible and were walking your dogs.|`|80ae4df7446032c7f13ca2d4052ed7fcaa	No it's not your fault cats are just naturally hunters. When my stupid cat killed my bird I blamed myself for not waking up but even if I had the bird would have still died. You did nothing wrong aside from letting the Squirrel try to be like every other squirrel and go outside sometimes these things just happen. They suck but it's unfortunately part of life. I'm sorry for your loss. :(|`|80df948c33b8e772d4a35ce0f8072db9aa	Its not your fault, wild animals always know they are wild, especially if they previoudly lived in teh wild.<br>  <br>  Because you had looked after it, it was fine, and you let it have the choice of going back home or staying with you, it obviously decided that it wanted to stay outside.<br>  <br>  Because the cat got it wasn't your fault, if you hadnt made friends with it, the cat still have gotten it.<br>  <br>  Be thankful taht you got to meet a beautiful creature like the squrrel, and maybe it'll come back as something else and remember.<br>  <br>  If you do feel to blame, think to your self, it didn't come back and how were you to know if it was going to come back. Perhaps you need to sit out in the wild for a few hours, with some snacks and a book, and see what other friends you can make, apreciate the wilderness, and if some one follows you home, then perhaps try feeding it out side,, up high or away from your house, dont try to make it tame or anything, just become friends, and let it be wild, dont feed it every day, as it may decide to rely on you for food.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|YIaL0Azfaa	NO! it wasnt your fault! squirrels need out door time they are WILD animals.. I'm not saying you should have kept it but it wasnt at all your fault that it died.|`|FZP1mF00aa	although it's not your fault the cat killed it, you should never have brought the squirrel inside.
3950eddc687eb957353910fe23991afeaa	Is it worth it? Well, that really depends on what you expect to get out of it. 2 mice can give you a lot of mice before even one year has passed. If you are breeding for sale then make sure you have a market that will always be there. A female mouse can become pregnant within 24 hours after giving birth and has the litter within 3 weeks. A female baby is ready to breed 6-8 weeks of age. If the pet stores do not want any at the time you may be stuck with a lot of mice. <br>  They do smell! Very bad. The males are worse than females as they continuously mark their scent. The male does not have to be taken away from the female at any time unless you choose to give her a break, which I recommend, he will take care of the babies as much as she does, very helpful for her. Only one mature male per colony though, they will kill each other. Most breeders have 1 male to 4 females. <br>  If selling to pet stores, accept that the mice will most likely be feeders. If you don't like this idea, I don't recommend breeding and selling. Hope this helps.|`|1ead03a9320202247e2281782d10cb78aa	Mice can be a pain they bite and they are smelly, I have snakes and even just getting them once every 2 weeks sucks but it is all worth it to see my snakes happy and full. I guess it's a matter of opinion.|`|5b05f6e80c1c5687f4237d636553ac82aa	Sure, why not.  I've had 3 pet mice in the past.  You have to start off with getting 2 of the pinkies (baby mice) and raise them together.  If you get 2 older mice they will try killing eachother.  When the female is impregnated, make sure to transfer the male into another tank/cage.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Go for it.  I did it for quite some time.  They don't eat much.  They multiply quickly.  And they are great pets.  I just started out with a couple older females and a male.  I never had any troubles and I never took the male out of the female(s) cage.  Good Luck : )

C1eaHtOjaa	This could be serious. <br>  <br>  <br>  can you not talk to a vet , this horse could get blood poisoning from infection, and die.<br>  The last answer is correct in that other legs can swell because they have taken extra weight, if this is the case, very gentle cold hosing, of the swollen limb, for no more than 10 minutes at a time, may help. Support bandaging can help but needs to be checked frequently, if it gets too tight or uneven in any way, it will hurt her and will cause more problems.<br>  If she dose not improve soon, A vet is the best option, Try and find a veterinary charity that may be able to help you.|`|NCx3dpleaa	Is it the bottom of the leg or the top? Many times, when a leg is injured, the other leg "stocks up". This is fluid retention and is releived once the horse can move around freely on both legs.  A sore leg causes the horse to put a lot of pressure on the opposite leg, which then also gets sore and swollen. We like to wrap both legs for support while the horse is healing from a leg injury.|`|vUaWOFBqaa	ok u might try neosporin and then buy medical tape and stuff to wrap around it this will stop infection. she will let u no if she is in pain she will whine and neigh and lay down so do this stuff and she will be fine

Then he will have a better idea of what procedure he will need to perform, and then he'll be able to give you a cost.  Xrays, followup visits, operation....he'll discuss that with you at the appointment.|`|8H7FQC8naa	they put something on the leg to keep it form moving i dont know how much it will cost|`|UT3y2tNeaa	the vet will put the paw back in place and then he or she will put it in to a cast and then possibly in a sling so that the cat can not move the foot and inflict further damage to the paw.

0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	Okay, you dont really give to many details here.<br>  <br>  When you say, "staying in the saddle when you land", how do you mean? it's okay if you sitting forward for the first stride or two after the fence, depending on the size of the jump - this will affect how long it takes you to get your bum back in the saddle.<br>  <br>  You shouldnt be sliding forward on a refusal if you're keeping your heels well down.  If your horse is prone to refusing then you should be keeping your weight slightly behind the horses centre of gravity, heels well down, this should help. ( i had a horse that was prone to refusing if he thought he could get away with it!!!)<br>  <br>  If your horse is refusing ALOT, then you should probably do one o more of the following:<br>  <br>  1.    Back off on the size of the jumps, and how often you jump, the horse could be becoming sour to jumping, try something different for a while.<br>  <br>  2.  Check your tack, the horse could be uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  3.   Have your vet take a look at him, there could be something else wrong with him, like a subclinical virus, which may be casuing him to feel slightly off colour and therefore not keen on jumping.<br>  <br>  Based on what you gave me, that's the bst i can do for now.....hope it helps!!!:)|`|ca156152c9b7c527c3eefa2193568ae9aa	Some Jumping Tips <br>  <br>  Shorten your stirrups two holes, unless you use long stirrups. <br>  To keep your horse interested, don't jump the same jump over and over. <br>  If your horse refuses, make sure you take it again, and put leg pressure on the side that he ducks to. <br>  Here is the right way to learn to jump:<br>  At first an inexperienced rider should use a neck strap so that there is no risk of a nervous or frightened rider pulling hard on the reins and jabbing the horse in the mouth with the bit.<br>  <br>  For the approach, sit down in the saddle, keeping close contact with your legs and the horse. Support your weight with your thighs and feet, not with your hands. Never look down, and only use light contact on the reins. You have to allow the horse freedom to move his head and neck.<br>  <br>  When the horse leaves the ground, bend your body forward coming slightly out of the saddle. Once in the air, follow the horse's mouth with light contact, bringing your body even farther forward to maintain the center of gravity.<br>  <br>  As the horse lands, bring your body back to the normal riding position. And don't fall off!<br>  <br>  Dealing with a Horse that Refuses to Jump<br>  <br>  What is really going on when a trained horse refuses to jump?<br>  <br>  If your horse is refusing to jump, then he or she might be lacking in respect or trust for the rider. Or, even with all the respect and trust in the world, if the rider is not setting up the approach well enough then perhaps the horse is just saying "I can't".<br>  <br>  If a horse does not have ample respect and trust for the rider then it just can't realistically be expected to go anywhere and do anything that it doesn't really want to do.<br>  <br>  If you know that you and your horse are in a reliable partnership and you think the problem is solely regarding the jumps, then the next question would be is he or she sound enough to be jumping?<br>  <br>  But many times, it just comes down to the rider's experience and ability.<br>  Hope that was of some help and good luck|`|637bc3f695af019cfb6650f816b6cb1faa	Do not jump until you can trot and canter with no stirrups.

Ex: First start with ground poles, then x-rail, small vertical,etc<br>  5.Shorten your stirrups<br>  6. Maybe he is jumping to early, slow him down by sitting down in the saddle and make him jump when you want to by two-pointing at the right time before the jump<br>  7. If his jump is big, make your two-point bigger<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If he is just being a butt head, carry a crop or use spurs that are the right size (big crop or little crop, big spurs or little spurs, sharp or blunted spurs?). Make him walk over the jump when he refuses.

(if its low) <br>  * keep a tight guide reign (outside reign) and he/she will not be able to duck out.  <br>  as you approach the fence, keeping a tight guide reign, erge her/him on w/ your legs or even a crop if you have to.  if your horse comes to a halt infront of it make it go over it at whatever speed.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|aecd4219c4a658bd808fe5f7f54efa76aa	Ok. If Your A Pretty Good Jumper. You Should Be Staying In The Saddle. Maybe You Are TOO Far Over The Center Of Balance. And If Your Horse Refuses To Make A Jump. Calmly Lead Him Away From The Jump. And Try again. Dont Take Him Into a show If He Fears The Obsticles. Teach Him At Home Not To Be Afraid Of Them. The Show Ring Is No Place For Training. There Is Too Much Distraction, And He Can Easily Lose Patience Wtih Jumping All Together. When Your Training Him. Let Him Get Aquainted With What He Is Expected To Jump.

It sounds like you need a small-medium size dog that doesn't shed, is fairly intelligent and easily trainable and protective.  Try a miniature poodle or standard shorthair dachshund.

If you spend a lot of time at work then maybe an Autralian Sheepdog would not be the right choice. You just really need to think about what kind of dog you would like to have and do some reading on it. <br>  <br>  Make sure though that you find out the rules and regulations within your apartment building about dogs i.e., weight regulations, etc. Also, with the mention of size, don't rule out a larger dog if that is what you want. As long as you are dedicated to taking your dog for regular walks and romps in the local dog parks then a larger dog would work as well. Just because they are big doesn't mean that they need an acre of land!!<br>  <br>  Good luck as a future dog owner!|`|7daeb31d30aa7f1cccb65acccd58a272aa	a small dog like a dacshound. i can sell you one right now!|`|9c17d03da99facf6ea19c79c0cca690baa	I definetly suggest a dachsund because I have one and she is great with my younger brothers.

Depending on your budget a 15-30 lb dog would probably be fine.  I had a french bulldog in college and he was awesome in my apt!  Also, a puppy as hard as they try, have accidents and landlords dont like that. An older housebroke dog may be the key. Talk to a vet or people in your building  who have dogs.  Also consider how much exercise you are able to give the dog.  You dont want to get a jack russell  if you dont want to walk him a few times a day, you dont want to get an english bulldog if you want a jogging buddy.  Good luck, also check shelter dogs~! They are the best|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	This answer is easy to answer but hard to believe!<br>  <br>  If you want a dog that hardly ever barks........in fact only when it feels a threat to itself or you.  If you want a dog that can be left in while you go to work or shopping and again wont annoy the neighbors........if you want a dog that is awesome at guarding......if you want a dog that will practically house train itself then there is only one dog for you.  The Japanese Akita.  This dog is large at 28 inch tall and 110lb in weight but very quiet.  Also whilst you sleep in the bedroom He/She sleeps in the living room.  I know you probably wanted a small dog but they tend to bark............I think most dogs from China/Asia dint tend to bark much though..........I can assure you we leave our Akita in and the neighbors have never once complained.

ffae3846b82d4433b36a7b8888f27acbaa	I think this will help answer your question.<br>  <br>  What is Founder?<br>  Founder is a general term that may mean different things to different people. The clinical name laminitis narrows down what most people would call founder. Laminitis is a swelling inside the horse's foot. Because it is inside the foot, the swelling creates special problems mostly because the hoof is a rigid structure that surrounds a bone. The only place that can swell is between the hoof wall and the bone where the blood supply passes through to nourish the foot. This narrow space is where the laminae are located. <br>  Laminae form the latticework that connects the inside of the hoof wall to the surface of the bone. Laminae on the inside surface of the hoof wall interlock with laminae covering the bone, and where they meet creates a connection similar to Velcro. The connection is strong, has many blood vessels running through it, and is responsible for supporting the weight of the horse. The health of the foot depends on the health of the laminae, and when laminitis occurs, the horse is in serious trouble.<br>  <br>  <br>  If the swelling is minimal, the laminae may recover without much damage. As the swelling increases, a cascade of complications may result. First, the swelling creates pressure inside the foot that diminishes blood flow. Without enough blood, the laminae begin to die. Dead laminae don't bind together and the wall actually separates from the bone. In some this separation can be seen on the underside of the foot where the sole and wall meet (the area known as the white line).<br>  <br>  Separation of the foot is bad enough; in some cases this separation may not be complete and only separates in patches around the foot. But any kind of separation can create a rotation of the coffin bone inside the foot because the supporting laminae aren't supporting the bone in place anymore. The tension from the muscles in the leg, normally counteracted by the strong connection of the laminae, is now strong enough to pull the back of the bone up towards the leg, thus causing the toe of the bone to point downward. This rotation of the bone can be so severe that the bone could penetrate the sole of the horse's foot. Even if the horse recovers, too much rotation and the animal won't ever be sound again.<br>  <br>  Inflammation|`|eb501510921562107774c5b2d2e14333aa	Crikey not heard it called that for donkeys years hehehe<br>  <br>  Laminitis  - ouch.|`|90fd6688b8cbf6f61a55e9d603c7d24eaa	It isnt just spring grass that can cause a horse/pony to founder. The flush of growth in autumn (fall LOL) can also lead to your pony foundering.<br>  Ponies are more prone to founder.<br>  One of my shetlands came close to foundering and I had to lock him in a grass free area and feed him lots of hay and take him for walks so that he got the exercise and the blood flowing. This was on advice from my farrier. Not only is he a master farrier, he breeds Arabians.<br>  The only time I would call a vet in is of the pony needed pain relief|`|20938bcd0203fc20e940992f8f8be5faaa	Your horse has just been diagnosed with Founder. What can you do?<br>  <br>  Note: Please consult with your veterinarian. Founder is a serious health problem. Your veterinarian should always be part of your horse's hoof care program, and should be working cooperatively with your hoofcare professional.<br>  <br>  Founder means that your horse a mechanical problem with the hoof: due to poor hoof form, the laminae of the hoof capsule degenerated to the point where they could no longer hold their connection to the coffin bone (often showing up after a bout of laminitis, which can also be triggered by the mechanical founder). Your horse's coffin bone then rotated, and the degree of rotation is determined by x-rays from your veterinarian. A mild rotation of 5 degrees is considered possible to fix even by traditional standards, while rotations of 10 degrees and above (some horses can be 20 or 30 degrees rotated) are considered much more difficult, as the hoof is so severely damaged. However, horses have been brought back to health from serious rotation, though it will take considerable effort to do so (and the horse may need to be placed in a specialized hoof care clinic). <br>  <br>  If your horse has foundered, the first thing you need to do is educate yourself. This very expansive site is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to learn more about laminitis and founder:|`|7c9faeef63df0964fecf050c0389520eaa	founder is what happens when a horse or pony eats too much spring grass. they get real sick and could even die from it if not treated.|`|8ad1a8a4bc50a42c5d688f85504a8883aa	My horse had that before I bought her and she lived. Founder is too much rich foods (like oats). Their body gets overloaded on too much good stuff and not enough staples and they can often die.<br>  <br>  If they survive their feet start acting up growing like crazy, their hooves get hard to clip. They are especially prone to it again... especially when overweight or put out to pasture in the spring. I have to really watch my horse for this since she had it once.
AA10297863	I have never used this product,but I have a Lab that sheds alot.I'm not sure what it is costing you for this product,but i can offer an alternate solution.<br>  <br>  Your on the right track with the omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.Canned salmon is an excellent source of omegas,and most dogs love it.My Lab is 70 pounds,and she gets one half cup per day mixed in with her food.<br>  It has cut down on the amount she sheds alot.It will also help keep the coat soft and shiny.<br>  <br>  Just an added option you can try,if you haven't already.|`|AA11548502	Almost all shed stop products i have tried are imposible to work with. They smell horrible, your dog won't touch them with a ten foot pole (unless you are lucky), they are greasy, etc.... not to mention waaayy over priced!   My suggestion is giving you dog the fatty acids via gel caps.  You can get fish body oil caplets at gnc, walmart, pretty much anywhere; just make sure that they are body oils (higher nutrititive value)  My dogs average about 90 lbs and i spend  $11 per 180 caplets; each of my dogs gets 3 a day. (i use gnc fish body oils 1000 mg)  It takes about 6 weeks to see a difference, but WOW.  The best part is, you can smoosh a little piece of cheese around the caplet and they never know that they are eating it.  Its a cheap no mess way to get healthy skin and minimal shedding.  If you really want to use a liqud product, plain old olive oil has all of the same benefits and it is a lot less expensive and more palatable to the dogs (just dont heat it up, you will denature the VFA's).  good luck!  On a side note, evaluate your dog food, foods with a lot of grain fillers (corn and wheat) will make for an itchy dry coat compared to something made with rice/ rice bran.

Maybe you should teach him a lesson by putting him in a diferent pasture as his buddy (although he may make new ones)<br>  Another thing you could do is have some stand at  the gate waving their arms around and saying 'SHOO'<br>  If this, over everything else doesnt work, then try this-<br>  what is something he is scared of (not to the point where he will freak out, but he will just stay away from it) and put it next to the gate.

Most likely he will come back to you tired and hungry and possibly with a few injuries. I have known them to be missing for upto 2 weeks and then just stroll back in like nothing happened.<br>  When he does come back make sure you check him over for fight injuries as these are always prone to getting infected and causing abcesses.

gqjrBmu1aa	I wouldn't pay $800 for a horse with that many problems. First he is club footed which means extra money for shoes, he's a cribber which means you'll end up paying for barn, stall, and fence damage on top of vet bills seeing as cribbing horses are more likely to colic, develop ear and eye infections, and have mouth, teeth, and throat problems, he bites which is his owners own fault for not doing the proper ground work and respect exercises with him, and he has no papers which automatically makes his value shot.<br>  <br>  A professional horseman or educated equine person probably wouldn't even bother looking at the horse with the information you just provided. At the most a person looking for a cheap horse may pay in the range of 400-600 for him.<br>  <br>  <br>  My suggestion to a client who went to look at this horse would be not to buy this horse and invest that money they would put in towards him on a healthy sound equine or look at local equine rescues if they are looking for an affordable safe equine partner.|`|15b3a6cb8a321f05be4dac1774b9f240aa	Sight unseen, words only description, I would be willing to pay between 700. and 800. Left leg bothers me may be a short activity time, biting is a habit that can be broken, papers are only good if you are going to track her or use for breeding top dollar horse. (and if gelded not good for that)  Did not say breed and sometimes that would make a difference.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Club footed, a cribber, and a bitter......... I personally don't think he is even worth $800.  The equine market is so flooded right now, even good horses are selling cheap.  You can tell her to advertise him for 8, but I'm afraid she'll have to come down on that price eventually.|`|AbSRUsBUaa	A horse with mild club footedness can lead an active, athletic life. But, the greater the degree of rotation, the harder the use given the animal will contribute to development of "the bad stuff." (I havn't heard of navicular problems being associated with this defect, but all that means is that I havn't heard it.) Too much bad stuff and you have an unusable horse.  You need to find out the degree of rotation because depending on that, this horses might not be suitable for the jumping you're having him do. I would recomend not jumping him at all until you find this out. And when you do, your vet should be able to tell you a decent price.|`|e0d1fd0946635e07415a457b91cc8b6baa	Since the market is so overloaded right now, good registered horses are selling as cheap as $400 without all of the issues that this horse has. Personally, I would stay out of this if you value your friendship. If you price the horse to high it will be your fault when he does not sell, and if you tell your friend her horse is not worth much at all, then I can almost promise she is going to get mad that your think her horse is "worthless" If she got $100 for him she would be ahead, since she cannot ride him, and he sounds like a real stinker with the biting and the cribbing. There are just to many good horses to put up with the kind she has right now, but anything you say about pricing another person's horse can get you into trouble. I would let her price him and stay out of it. If he sells for her price, wonderful. If not, she will figure out he is overpriced.|`|eGL4dxdKaa	i'd say 1500, with the right owner and an expierenced one he could be a great jumping showhorse.|`|oWs7o8T7aa	800.00?  depends on what part of the nation..

gqjrBmu1aa	I actually have a large clydesdale named Houdini that we use in a bit less bridal for vaulting at my ranch. It all depends on the horse whether or not you are able to use certain tack or equipment. Some horses don't take well if they were trained differently and some take to it just fine.<br>  <br>  A great place for you to start your search for finding yourself a perfect draft is equine rescues. Many people make the mistake thinking they can care for such a large equine that they end up making the purchase before researching how much extra care a draft takes. Drafts are a larger build and require much more maintenance and feed and hay. That price adds up not to mention the farrier bill. Most farriers charge quite a bit more when a draft horse gets shod. Then you have to add on all the extra tack you'll have to purchase. Most quality bridals are pretty pricey for a draft. I would also make sure you have a lose slant trailer where you can remove a swinging door to make a bigger space in your trailer for a draft.<br>  <br>  My advice is do a lot of research before you make a purchase. Find a sound healthy draft if you are going to buy one this way it will cut the costs in the veterinarian area. Take some lessons in your area. Most barns have a draft of some sort. My ranch has friesians, clydesdales, welch, and Belgians. Most are used for free style vaulting, dressage, and some even go to rodeos and equine events with the cowgirl chicks. Take lessons to prepare yourself for such a gentle giant.|`|3123847bfc1f721ff2fb79b379fd25afaa	I have been wondering about the bitless bridle also.

As far as the cat is concerned you are playing favorites and she was there first, you are putting the dog higher in the animal domination scale.  You must let them work that out themselves.<br>  <br>  We have two cats.  We adopted two dogs.  When the dogs came into the house the cats and dogs fought and the cats hid.  This went on for about 3 weeks.  Eventually the cats learned that the dogs weren't going anywhere and learned to move around the house without disturbing the dogs and now get along with the dogs.<br>  <br>  All the animals sleep in the bedroom with us (we have a huge bedroom).  In the beginning the dogs would chase the cats around the bedroom in the middle of the night and the cats would chase the dogs.  But if we were to put the cats outside the bedroom we would have the same problem you do.<br>  <br>  The cat looks at it like you are playing favorites and she is now a second class citizen in your house.  She used to be allowed to go in the bedroom but now she is not.<br>  <br>  How would you feel if you were a kid and you were allowed to go into a room and all of a sudden someone else came into the family and they were allowed there but you weren't.<br>  <br>  Now you would be able to understand if someone explained it to you but animals won't. <br>  <br>  Animals live in a dominent situation and that system must be worked out by them and this does also include the sleeping situation.<br>  <br>  Leave the bedroom door open, let the animals wander the house at night (they don't sleep all night like we do).  Eventually it will work itself out.  You can't interfere with the natural process, it has to happen.|`|x6uaGeEEaa	Poor kitty cat...!!<br>  You have to start a retraining program for them<br>  <br>  Good luck..!!!

mgw00UxOaa	Is this a show steer?  We always snubbed ours up to a post for a little while each day to get them used to the halter and being unable to move around as they pleased, in between snubbing we'd work on walking around the pen using a lead rope to guide him where we wanted him to go and what to do.  2 months should be adequate time if you work on it everyday.  It seems like I'd spend about an hour or so at a time working with our steers.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Tie him up to a solid post.  Let him learn he has to give to the pressure from the halter rather than resist it.  Start leading him in an enclosed area.  If he doesn't want to move forward, get another halter broke steer out in front of him.  Practice setting him up and standing quietly.  2 months is plenty of time to get him in gear.    <br>  Remember, always stay at his shoulder, that is the safest area.  Good luck.|`|EEt7BNwHaa	do not wear a red shirt.<br>  do not dress like a clown<br>  get someone who breaks bulls for a living and you should be fine.

A snake is either a venomous/hot or a constrictor this is how the animal kills its prey.***<br>  Ball Pythons can get around/up to 6 feet long and depending on the sex will be very thick for females or somewhat thin for males.  They are great pets when handled regularly as with all herps.<br>  They eat rodentia or poultry the width of the thickest part of their body.<br>  They require a temps around 80-95 during the day and around 70-80 at night.  Use a heating pad and good lighting setup to maintian the warmth.<br>  Humidity should be not too moist but similar to a jungle.<br>  Substrate can be jungle, or shavings.  I like using the bed a beast.<br>  They are pretty easy as far as pets go.<br>  The biggest problem I encountered with them was that sometimes they will go through a phase of not eating, this has been documented for as long as 18 months!<br>  Now adays they come in so many different beautiful color phases, when I first had my Pythons that didnt exist!<br>  Well good luck and I hope you enjoy your snake!|`|7Oytc8KRaa	No there not hard to take care of. I owned a ball python and it was very easy to take care of. And a 50 gallon tank should be plenty big enough.|`|DymNj1C0aa	boas and pythons are types of snakes, a snake can't be both.<br>  <br>  There are many types of boas.  Rainbow, hog island, rubber, sand, rosy, red tail (boa consrictor) and more. They are all very different in care, size, and personality, so you'll have to be more specific.  Rosys are common and easy to keep, they're found in the US and dessert areas, they get to about 2 feet.  Rainbows need to be sprayed with water twice a day as they are tropical.  Red tails..my friend has a 20 pound one.  It's freaking huge.<br>  <br>  Pythons, well, you have green tree, burmese, blood, ball, and many others (I'm just going by what I can remember at the moment).  Again, all very different.  Balls can get to 6 feet, burms can get to 20 feet.  Depends what you want.<br>  <br>  *ah, I didn't read your edit.  Stupid me.<br>  <br>  50 gals is fine for a ball python.  They're great snakes!  Make sure you have lots of hides for him, feed him frozen mice if you can (mice fight back!), feed him out of the tank so he dosen't ingest substrate.  You'll love having one.|`|OVu2l4Nsaa	well it's really hard when they get loose.|`|Pp5juixDaa	Are you talking about a boa constrictor or a ball python? Boas are constrictors. Constrictors and pythons are different classifications of snakes, never heard of them cross breeding like that......|`|Tu2DJnDEaa	50 gallon tank is good for its adult size you could even house them in a 40 gallon breeder tank there whole life soyour fine with that.  they are esy to care for but need 60% humdity 92-95 degrees in the day in the basking spot and then mid 80's at nite.  also they will get between 4-6 foot males tend to be on the smaller side then females.  also make re you do research.
AA10327148	Geeesh!!! I can't believe the one that said to punish a six week old puppy!!! You would only end up with a traumatized mess of a puppy, that would never, ever stop hiding it in the house!!<br>  <br>  *Routine* is the most important aspect of training. From the beginning, feed 4 times per day, at the same times, and put the bowl up in 5 minutes, or when finished.<br>  <br>  A puppy will need to go just minutes after eating, so whisk her outside, and stay with her until she 'goes'..Giver her lots of praise when she does her job, play a few minutes, and come back in..<br>  <br>  If you can put down a bag of sand, from a garden center, it will give her a good place to go, so you can kind of aim her there, and not just all over your yard..<br>  <br>  After the first day, she should only need to go poop after eating, and perhaps at bedtime..<br>  <br>  However, she will need water down at all times, and need to pee frequently..so, outside every other hour for that..and keep a close eye on her..she will need to go during active play, and every time she wakes from a nap..If you watch her, you will see her acting restless, and sniffing the floor, etc when she needs to go..at first, peeing may be just a matter of pausing, and uh-oh, there it is..She won't even be aware...So its important to never scold her for peeing...this is what makes traumatized pups that refuse to pee outside, or try to hide it in the house..as they get scolded for it, and it becomes a traumatic event..<br>  Keep the product, Nature's Miracle, on hand, for instant cleaning of pee spots...or ask your pet supply which enzyme cleaner they recommend..<br>  <br>  Puppies physiology only allows them to help pee for about 1 hour per month of age...so expecting any more is unrealistic..a good reason for a playpen at night..If you don't yet have a crate, then there is really no need for one, as long as you won't be traveling too long with her (carry towels, by the way) She may hold it through the night, but is likely to need to pee at least once during the night..You can remove the water a couple of hours before bedtime..<br>  <br>  By following a routine, and being ever watchful for the first few days, you can have her petty well trained in just a couple of weeks..<br>  <br>  I house-train all of my pups before they every leave my home, and I do it an entire litter at a time..it normally takes about 4-5 days, with very few accidents..<br>  But, if you hang a little bell on the door, and show her you are ringing the bell each time you take her out, she is likely to begin ringing the bell when she needs to go..Just be very vigilant, and yet stay relaxed..an accident doesn't mean failure..<br>  Remember, it takes forever to potty train a human baby, and it is so nice that puppies can learn it so much faster, but they are still allowed to be babies, and don't deserve to be stressed about the training...<br>  If you have important areas to keep clean, just keep her away from those areas until she is a bit older..<br>  <br>  I recommend using a harness for the walking and leash training, as it is less frightening and stressful..eventually, as trust is developed, you can switch to a collar..but a soft harness takes the fear away from the beginning.<br>  <br>  Note: At six weeks, a puppy is normally still with her mom, who will clean it up as soon as she poops..It is illegal to sell puppies until they are 8 weeks old..so, please don't expect so much of her until she is a bit more mature..If you cause her to stress about potty training, she will likely become a puppy who eats it, trying to please you.|`|4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	Hold its backside over the potty and hope it sh1ts in the right place.

When we get puppies we have to realize its going to take time and patience to potty train the dog.  Some are quicker to learn then others and some are a lot slower.  You have to be consistant, patient and persistant.  The biggest mistake people make when potty training their dog is to let them have free run of the house.  This is a big mistake.  When you are at home and can supervise the dog let her out.  When you are not home you need to put her in a smaller area that has flooring that is easy to clean.  Take her out every two hours and bring her to the same spot each time and tell her to "go potty" or whatever you decide to use as the command just be sure to use the same command each time.  When she does go outside be sure to praise her, give her a treat and tell her "good potty".  Stick with it and she'll be potty trained.|`|n1RJjq0baa	Make sure you tell the dog when it has done something bad, using a strong voice but within a three second basis or it won't know what it is being punished for. but everyday it does something right like poop outside make SURE you reward it and in a three second basis! <br>  <br>  Have fun with your dog and good luck|`|p8KPAHSdaa	All you need is a crate <a href="http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....</a> , pencil and paper, and patience.<br>  <br>  You need to understand how your dog's bodily functions work to be more quickly successful. <br>  <br>  Puppies go to the bathroom on a schedule, it not just a random thing. Their bodies automatically eliminate whenever the gastrocolic reflex is triggered. Stretching of the stomach when the little ones eat triggers the reflex. As puppies get older they are able to overide the reflex and control when they eliminate. <br>  <br>  Somewhere between 5 mins-1 hr after eating is when pups will go to the bathroom. About 5-10 mins BEFORE you know it probably has to go - start with 15 min- 30 minutes after eating, take the pup outside or to the puppy pad. When your dog eliminates tell it "good potty!!!"<br>  <br>  Each dog's body is different so it may take you a few observations and trial and errors to get more precise. Now for the paper and pencil: make a chart and enter time fed/time of elimination--pee & poops. Soon you will know your puppy's bathroom schedules.<br>  <br>  Your pup will sniff and circle about 3 seconds before "the act." If you see it sniff and circle outside, tell it to "go potty" and give immediate praise. Eventually saying "go potty" will be the command that makes the pup go.<br>  <br>  You should have a special spot outside where you take it to do business every time. Take your pup out every two hours throughout the day. If it doesn't go, put it back in crate and try again in 20 minutes (don't be mad it won't know why--don't be mad at yourself either, it's just a schedule thing--you will learn). Eventually you'll find out what "the" schedule is. It might be your pup can hold for 3-4 hours. <br>  <br>  Take the pup outside first thing in the a.m. at the same time, and just before bedtime at the same time each eve.<br>  <br>  In the house if you have some mistakes, use vinegar water in a spray bottle to disinfect and remove the urine amonia smell.??If your pup makes a mistake, it's your fault, you haven't charted the automatic trigger times--so don't show your temper, don't rub its nose in it. <br>  <br>  If you are not specifically paying attention to your pup (sitting in your lap, playing with it and *always* being observant of the sniff and circle routine), she should be in her crate. <br>  <br>  I'd say in the evening 7-7:30pm is the last time to drink water for the night.|`|pgldviiWaa	you need to take her out every hour.  ask her "do you need to go outside"?  show here where the door is.  after feeding is a perfect time to take her outside because that is the most likely time for her to go #2.  reward her with treats when she goes outside and uses the bathroom.  you just need to work her|`|yz02yVxOaa	You can't potty train a puppy quickly.

OJOmNLRgaa	The best advice I can give you is just to start calling & talking to anyone & everyone you can.  Go to horse shows, introduce yourself...let people know that you are there & you are willing to learn.  Alot of trainers prefer expierenced apprentices but are willing to work with someone that is not as expierenced but has alot of drive & determination...personally I would rather work with someone that is less expierenced & has a desire to learn then someone who feels that they are quite expierenced & are less likely to pay attention to what you are telling them.  When I started out doing my apprenticeships, I just called every number I could find until someone would give me some help..I ended up finding an awesome trainer & judge that I worked under for over a year...My second apprentinceship I found on Equimax.com which is an awesome website if you are looking to find trainers looking to hire...you may have to start out at the bottom, (I.E. Mucking stalls & grooming) But if in that time you can prove to the trainer that you are serious, passionate, hardworking, & willing to learn you never know what kind of opprotunities that can open up for you.  Don't give up..if this is what you really want to do then prove it..learn as much as you can & watch everyone & everything...I learned alot just by sitting at the warm-up & practice rings & watching what people were doing.  Don't be afraid to walk up & talk to a trainer..we don't bite!..the worst they can do is tell you No...you never know what you may luck into.  Good luck!|`|80df948c33b8e772d4a35ce0f8072db9aa	Im glad taht more poeple are getting into teh Training business...and i understand about inexperience.<br>  <br>  Firstly write down all the things you can do with a horse, however small, grooming through to canter and saddle and bridle. As a trainer, you need to be able to ride different horses and have extensive knowledge in a particular type of training. I would suggest simply making up a resume with your qualifications, and if they insist taht you need more experience but have the passion, they may keep teh position open or let you study and help them.<br>  <br>  hang in there and if you find a course or clinics, do it all, any experience is a good experience|`|e0d1fd0946635e07415a457b91cc8b6baa	This is a really good article by Cleve Wells on becoming a horse trainer.

I wouldn't tell anyone what you want to do as they might think you want to steal their training techniques just work and learn and plan, start from the bottom and work your way to the top, your not ready to train just yet by the sounds of it so be patient, good luck.

If a wolf tooth is small and fits tightly up against the second premolar, it might not cause a problem. But if the wolf tooth is large or there is a space between the wolf tooth and second premolar, it is much more likely to result in a problem because the tooth is standing alone, unprotected and the mouthpiece of the bit could hang up in the space between the wolf tooth and the second premolar. <br>  <br>  Wolf teeth are usually removed when a yearling colt is gelded to take advantage of the fact that he is already sedated for the castration. With fillies, wolf teeth can be removed anytime after about 12 months of age and before snaffle bit training begins. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.horsekeeping.com/Horse_Newsletter/July_2002.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsekeeping.com/Horse_Newsle...</a>|`|eGL4dxdKaa	They will be very sensitive at the mouth and may even become nippy-- they will have trouble eating too and may stop all together... Make sure you get a dental checkup at least once a year, and if you suspect your horse has a bad wolf tooth you should call the dentist!|`|fabd51109a28209640e603023928d734aa	Wolf teeth should be removed if the horse is having trouble with the bit. If you don't use a bit, don't worry about it. Wolf teeth take up the space where the bit lies in the mouth. If metal hits the tooth it hurts. Try tapping your tooth with a metal spoon, you will see exactly how the horse feels.|`|gCMLzrTAaa	If your having alot of trouble with your horse throwing his head  when you ask for him to do anything that makes you put any pressure on the bit ...it may seem like you have a heavy hand but it could be the teeth....the bit hits his teeth when you are asking him to do stuff ....sometimes even while you are leading him he may try to pull his head away...if you go through a lot of bits trying to find the right one with no luck ...   that might make you think it is his teeth and the not the bit..anyway call your vet and get his opinion
CA5lOMhCaa	Honestly, I wish you luck with this. MinPin's are great little dogs, but like all dog breeds they have their faults. Most of the ones I have seen have 2 issues: hyper-activity, and difficult to house train. Some of the hyper will lessen when she hits about 2 or so, but if she is typical of her breed, she will never be calm. As far as potty training, I would try and litter box train her. Some of the MinPin people I know have success with litter training, as far as just traditional house breaking.... I can think of 2 of maybe 50 that I am in contact with that are truly "house broken"|`|YJmGf4RLaa	some of the problem may be her food.    you can always housebreak a dog   it just takes real work|`|f3a95b4c0d5743c7290138584c5ce3f3aa	Puppies are hyper but most calm down around 2 years old. Training also helps.|`|kIIf9Z6Eaa	Some small dog breeds, like min pins are typically hyper.  You should still be able to house train her at this age.  Find a good dog trainer to help with both problems.|`|ubrYk78waa	I don't know anything about Min Pins, but she is still a puppy. She should calm down as she grows. Is she spayed? Everyone says that will help calm them.<br>  <br>  Well, it doesn't always work. I have a 4 year old APBT that is spayed. Her age has calmed her a bit. But when she wants attention she turns back into a puppy, a 55 pound puppy. She can be quite a handful.<br>  <br>  The best thing I ever did was put a dog door in my back door. It made easy to train my little Terrier. Then when I got the Beagle and later the Pit the Terrier trained them for me.|`|qgiLX1wIaa	she is so young that is why she is hiper
N7KGJ5w6aa	no, you can't teach them to interact. The only interaction you will get from this is one or both of the animals dying.<br>  <br>  They are natural enemies in the wild, and a hamster will chew up a cockatiel in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  I know this from experience, I lost a cockatoo to a teddy bear hamster about 4 years ago :(|`|AA10180108	Why would you want a cockatiel to interact with a hampster.  I had a female cockatiel that was almost attached to me all the time.  She was a serious cuddle bunny.  She didn't care to be around other birds or animals.|`|nLkRqVQLaa	yes but cockatiels dont like humans that much and plus they cant talk and are really boring.|`|wMjFfsnSaa	Why? It is dangerous to both animals and shavings in a hamster cage can be dangerous if inhaled by the bird. If it's cedar, it's dangerous to the hamster, too.  So the point is, don't put either in the other one's cage and don't allow them to interact.
Sj0EedeIaa	ive had experience with hamsters so heres the best ican give you<br>  you should clean the cage once or twice a week to keep bacteria out and smell<br>  they have special cage cleaner at pet stores<br>  you should make sure he has good food that is filled with vitamins and you should give them fruits and veggies cause they need a varied diet<br>  take uneaten food out within a day or so<br>  they like yogurt and peanut butter too but No chocolate<br>  make sure they can allways get to fresh water<br>  as for cages dont go to fancy olr it will be hard to clean and if its not cleaned all the way your hamster could get sick and die like my buddy did<br>  it shouldnt be a tall cage because the tubes that leed up to platforms where the water usually is can get clogged as did buddys also they can have a tube that leads up to a den to the side or top of the cage but make sure it gets clean<br>  make sure they have a wheel to exercise and sticks or toys too knaw on <br>  there are a ton of toys your hamster will love at the pet store<br>  preferably petsmart<br>  make sure they stay out of the sun and that they can allways get to water!<br>  the best bedding to use is ceder because it makes the cage smell better<br>  hope this helps and makes your hamster very happy!<br>  oh and they last about two to three years maybey more if your lucky|`|0EJwnyBVaa	A good clean cage, fresh water, hamster food.

7cb0882b49e324af9fba3e0bd3d1048daa	Beagles were bred as hunters.  They bound and leap when running because their bodies are close to the ground and they must be able to clear obstacles.  <br>  <br>  Also, the bounding increases their running efficiency and can help them run faster.  Just as deer, beagles are good for running short spurts.  <br>  <br>  It is perfectly normal for your dog to run like that.|`|AA12242323	that is what they are prone to hunt so that is why they run like that..it makes them go faster and it also relaxes their legs instead of running like a chahuahua. i hope i helped :]

I'd come to the conclusion that he was going to have to be kept outside ~ I hated that idea so I asked my cousin who's family owns a dog obedience school she said put a bell on the door knob & hanging it low enough for them to reach & when you put them out, ring the bell & say stuff like "you need to go out, you want to go potty etc... while ringing it & then put them out.

You should also pick up the poop and put it where you want them to go and they should catch on fairly quickly. Make sure that you clean the area you don't want them to go really well with an enzyme cleaner to get rid of the scent.|`|Non0u2Tyaa	It is your responsibility to watch over your dogs at all times.  signs that your dogs might give when they have to go are :<br>  .Sniffing<br>  .Pacing<br>  .Circling<br>  .Staring at you<br>  <br>  If your dog gives one of these signs, pick them up immediately and CARRY them to the pad, placing them on it.  when they start to go, PRAISE them with lots of love (and treats!)|`|vFYbXkxSaa	The first answer is good - I trained my little dogs to go on their paper by picking them up and putting them on it when they look like they are about to pee<br>  If they pee on the floor, take some of the paper and rub it in their pee and put it on the paper so that the paper will have that scent - then take them over and say "on your paper"<br>  When they pee on their paper, say "Yorkie (whatever his/her name) peed on her paper - Yorkie's a good girl"  then give a treat.<br>  If they are about to pee on the carpet, say "Yorkie, on your paper!" in an indignant voice.<br>  You should also train them to go outside though, they need two walks or longer a day so they can go outside also<br>  My dogs pee outside most of the time but if they drink a lot of water and are left alone for 8 hours they know they can also pee inside on their paper - they have little bladders so I don't want to make them hold it if I'm not home<br>  Good luck  - be patient and consistent and they will get it. Treats and praise with a high voice do wonders|`|vNVGLNCaaa	First off if they are that old why are you having them poop and pee on pads? They should be peeing and pooping outside. They are old enough to hold their bladder for longer periods of time so you dont need to have them do it on the pad. They should be taken for a long walk in the morning. This will not only give them excersize but also let them relieve themselves plenty for the time while your not home. put them in their cages as soon as you come home take them out of their cages and take them back outside. then when they come inside the house tie a leash to your waist and one around their neck and dont let them out of your site. if they start to pee or poop make a loud noise and immediately say outside or some command word and take them outside. this will help you potty train them to go outside. if you want them to go on a puppy or doggie potty instead of a training pad (training pads are only for puppies not really older dogs) then every time you see them going to go to the bathroom then take them to the potty and show them where it is. they will eventually get it to go in that place. you can even try putting some of their own sent on the puppy potty. this will help in the training process. but if you dont take your dogs outside to go to the bathroom and get excersize then they will continue to pee and poop in your home.
AA10352146	Dogs and cats both provide lots of affection, and kittens are very playful, but tend to loose some of they playfulness as they mature, but they will still be up for a game of string!<br>  <br>  Dogs are much more work-very much like caring for a baby. A beagle is fairly high energy, and will mature to be playful, but will be very hyper as a pup.<br>  <br>  Dogs are more satisfying when you train them well, but there is also more potential for heartbreak, and you will likely expericne both before your pup is grown! A cat needs very little training which is easy to do, but cats can be very sweet as well, and they purr.<br>  <br>  Either way you will have a great pet, and you should pick what is best for your family.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|2f222cf9ea6efe26bd26fd1fc59e3d29aa	it depends on how much time you can spend with them, dogs need constant company and lots of exercise, my parents dog has two 5 mile walks a day, my dad gets up at 5am to walk her before he goes to work and then once he gets back and my mum or brother take her for not so long walks in between<br>  <br>  cats however look after themselves, my parents have 2 and all they need is feeding and making sure they have access to water, ours also only sleep inside when it is cold, they like to sleep on our one story extention roof when its warm<br>  <br>  also out of our 3 pets one of the cats is the most affectionate, she always wants to be cuddled and near you|`|bMW1u8DSaa	i would choose a dog because with cats u have to change litterboxes and those make ur house stink. and u have to stop them from clawing furniture. in the long run a dog would be better for u. especially if ur sister is a little kid. i mean how many kids want to change a litterbox. just tell ur mom these reasons. yes cats r more affectionate but dogs r more fun to play with. cats r independent creatures and could care less if u were there or not. in the end i would choose a dog|`|p9qiQFIGaa	Dogs are truly man's best friend.|`|4LzQwBDIaa	don't get a cat their adorible but you only get to pplay w/ them while their young then when their older they hide and you never see them dogs are a better pet b/c they are cute and they follow you no madder how old hey our and always want you to play w/ them.|`|83c06546fecd5a078e76109f1298227aaa	well a cat would be an  easyer pet because they can stay home alone and you dont have to worry about them makin a mess(cats are tooooooo lazy) and witha dog you have to be alert for any acidents..... but i personaly think that a dog is more fun to play with than a cat cats dont like to play as much.... well they both have there positives and negatives butjust choose the one you like best base it on you not your mom or sister its gonna be your pet choose what YOU think is best well good luck|`|AA11243725	You Know I would say a cat just for now then maybe in the future you could get a dog cuz right now your dad needs some time to get used to having animals around and then with the school problem you should probaly get a puppy next summer brake this way You will have all summer to train it <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|AA12010051	i have a cat and a beagle i would say talk them you mom into getting both|`|YtYkisG8aa	Beagles are great pets get one please or a grey hound|`|a7e7914321e55ff9f15eae92919c8edfaa	dogs are more friendly and they are more willing to follow you aroung and play with you but cats usually dont interact that much|`|fjPLjYbGaa	Given your circumstances I would say get a cat, they take less looking after and pretty much look after themselfs.

Cats are just as affectionate as dogs. Many are just as playful. Plus all you have to do is show them where the litter box is and they will be instantly house trained. As for clawing the furniture, you can train them not to. It’s not that hard. There are these rubber claw things you can put on so they don’t scratch. You do not have to take your cat for walks every day either. <br>  <br>  Puppies are about 1000 times more work. Beagles in particular are difficult to house break. Many are not housebroken until they are about 2 years old. Most will howl and bark a lot but you can always train them not to. Overall dogs are more work and require more attention than cats. Having a dog is just like having a 2 year old child. If that is what you want to deal with, then go with the puppy. It sounds like you would be happier with a puppy anyway.|`|N3W4PAEhaa	Speaking from experience, dogs are always the better choice, however.....beagles need alot of attention and a big yard to run in.  They also tend to be either diggers, or they loooooove to run and check out their entire neighborhood.  If it's you, your sister and your parents?  I would opt for a kitten first.....especially if your parents will have to share the responsibility for taking care of the little furball.  =) =)  Animals, all kinds, are GREAT!

c52cbd262f9bbe8b25813042e1adaf6caa	If I were you, I'd take mom to the vet and have her hear it from him that the cat checks out ok.  Your mom might not be a big cat fan (neither is mine).  Your mom is wrong however.  You most certainly CAN see fleas and you can see their dirt on the cat.  If you want to keep the cat, tell her that you will keep her in your room, that way if there is anything wrong with the cat, it will be confined to your area and you will take car of anything that happens.  I strongly suggest you take a trip to the vet with mom.  She seems to think she knows it all about pets and is doubting a professional.  As for hitting the cat with a broom...I am a HUGE animal rights fan and do not like hearing stuff like that.  After the cat has kittens, have the cat spayed.  Try to get good homes for the kittens, because obviously mom is not going to go for all those cats in her house nor in your room.  Good luck.|`|TF6YaI6iaa	wow that's harsh take her to the vet and so that she can her it and then she might believe you and the vet.|`|WD0ZbnsTaa	Get the vet on the phone to chat with her.|`|d9FI5Au2aa	Why does your Mom think you can't see fleas? Of course you can. Is your Mom stable or does she have mental issues? I don't mean to be rude but she does not sound all there. You can do as the others suggested but I don't know if that will really work since she ought to just believe you after all you must have a receipt from the vet to prove you went.|`|qWCH7uwmaa	I think the most likely explanation is that she doesn't want to feed and take care of a cat and her litter of kittens.  <br>  <br>  She probably is just trying to make it easier for you by saying something is wrong with the cat rather than telling you outright that you aren't allowed to have the pet.
Bw18seFqaa	try www.petfinder.com  you should be able to find a malamute thru rescue or shelter.|`|QT7nsNGLaa	There are Malamute and Sled dog rescues.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.malamuterescue.org/rescue/listorg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.malamuterescue.org/rescue/lis...</a>   is just one site I found.   Google it or check the national club for links.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mals are big dogs as you know, so any vet bills tend to be bigger as well.   I question that you can afford a second dog since you a saying you can't pay over $350 for a purebred Malamute.    Even a free dog costs money for food and vet bills.<br>  <br>  At least here in CA Malamute, Siberian and Sled Dog rescues are overflowing.    And the adoption price is very reasonable since the dogs are already spayed/neutered and have shots.<br>  <br>  Consider being a foster home perhaps and if you find the right girl, you can adopt her.<br>  <br>  Be very wary of buying a puppy.   I don't know any reputable breeder that would sell a puppy for that cheap, considering all the costs that go into breeding a healthy litter from healthy tested parents.<br>  <br>  Learn what OFA, CERF and BAER stand for before getting a puppy.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, exercise your male, and train him....aggressive Mals are not good for the breed.   He may never like other male dogs, but he can learn to listen to you, no matter what dogs are around.    Getting a second dog when your first acts up, can create a problem.|`|yG3TLjGjaa	you could try www.petfinder.com, www.puppyfinder.com, or www.k9stud.com ( they sometimes have puppies for sale)

See, cats can be finnicky things. A stubborn cat will refuse a food it dislikes until it is literally too late to change its mind. My younger cat, Beziman, isn't too picky, but my old cat, Sid, certainly is. I have tried in vain to switch his food several times (we still have several cans of Felidae sitting in the pantry), but this is the single brand he will eat and I'd rather have my cat fat and happy than miserable or dead.<br>  For his health, yes, I'd love for him to just comply and eat wet food. He's had serious trouble with feline cystitis, which is what first prompted us to try a wet food (which he just would not eat!), and the poor thing has several missing teeth. <br>  However, it just isn't going to happen, so que sera, sera.<br>  <br>  Where are you located?<br>  - New England.<br>  <br>  Is the cat section your usual section?<br>  - Nope, I'm a Dog Sectioner. ;-)<br>  <br>  Do your cats wear their I.D. tags?<br>  - They haven't got any.<br>  <br>  How do you feel about my answer for anyone who wants to know good things to feed their cats?<br>  - It's okay, but it applies more appropriately to dogs.

I have also used other Purina brands to treat my cats symptoms of Chronic Pancreatitis. <br>  <br>  Usually I would agree with you on the Purina and Science Diet, but in some cases it can be useful. The best food for a cat is wet or raw food. See catinfo.org for more information.
jV7SmnaTaa	Well, there is a wide range of prices for most of the things.<br>  <br>  Body Clipping by a professional can run you $150.  It can much less by an amateur or friend.  It's really helpful if you can get a horsey friend that can teach you to do it yourself.  It'll save you a lot of $.<br>  <br>  Renting a trailer has a variety of expenses.  If you're just renting a trailer and pulling it yourself - you'll need a large truck.  If you rent it from an actual rental place it would be atleat $50-100 depending on how far you're traveling.  If you're having someone else haul your horse they usually will charge about $0.75/mile with a minimum of $50.  Again, a horsey friend that's already going to the show might be happy to take you along for $20, so try to find a horsey friend.<br>  <br>  Local open shows around here are usually pretty inexpensive for entry fees.  We usually pay a $3 office fee and then $3 per class.  So, you can easily ride on $20.  That is for shows that contain western pleasure, hunter under saddle, equitation, or game classes like barrels, poles, etc.<br>  <br>  When I have shown at schooling dressage shows  or jumping classes I usually paid about $20 per class.<br>  <br>  The biggest fee is if you need a stall.  If the show is more than one day or your horse doesn't tie to the trailer - then you need a stall.  That is usually about $50 plus shavings.<br>  <br>  If riding in the english discipline you'll probably need your horse's mane braided.  That will cost you about $50-100 depending on the person.  There are videos out there that can teach you for about $50.  It does require a lot of practice, but is definately a great skill.<br>  <br>  Anyway - hope that helps.  Enjoy your new horse!|`|034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	I love to show, but because of the gas prices and everything, it costs me about $500 for just one show.  I show AQHA and the nearest sanctioned shows are 100 miles from where I live.  The show fees would only cost me $150, but the cost of getting my horse to the show is just too much for me to do it very often.  I do all my own grooming, so clipping and such is not a problem.  <br>  <br>  If all you do is local open shows, you might pay $5 per class, but again you have to figure out how to get your horse to the show.  I normally charge anywhere between $150-200 for a body clip depending on how cooperative the horse is, so if you don't need to body clip, don't.  That's one of the reasons I keep my show horse in under lights all winter, so he doesn't get long shaggy hair.|`|vRrOPaiNaa	It depends what kind of show you go to. For example 4H is 40 bucks for the whole day The Meadow is like 45 for a whole divison ECSJ is 75 and USEF and USHJ ALOT! And plus do you have a trailer cuz tht will cost you too!|`|aw6ypXTQaa	Trailer rent = $100 Clipping- this is not necessary so to start with don't worry about it as you don't want to have extra expense. Show entry fees range from $15 to $50 for local shows. then there's the hay and petrol costs. Also they also add on around $4 for first aid. So around $150 for a local show including all the above on a low budget. hope this helps. x
bd0e62f6649334b0dc67af506ebd7128aa	Most dogs love the cool crunchiness of baby carrots.

As far as I know, carrots are ok....rabbits eat them...:)|`|93ix6nyvaa	Carrots are okay for dogs, but too much of anything isn't good for dogs (and humans, for that matter).

L22hVXTIaa	A raw diet is fine, but so is a good quality dry dog food.  Just be sure you buy good quality with meat as the first ingredient.  Steer clear of dog foods containing wheat, corn, barley, etc.  The dog just need regular feeding with a good quality dog food and time.  He won't put on good flesh overnight, be patient.  I would suggest you try Wellness, Canidae, Taste of the Wild, Blue Buffalo, Innova, etc.  Good luck and God bless you for fostering - it's a work of love.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	Feed him well and when you leave, put him on a heavy chain....it will build his muscles up alot|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Just feed him a good quality diet.|`|4KTmiQ0paa	Ask a vet if there is any special foods that can help a dog gain weight and be sure to exercise him to develop the muscles in his back quarters.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	A good quality dog food will help.

Z0yBiiVKaa	If your father says no, then the answer is no. Move out if you want a dog.

Ask your mom.|`|g7Euz6Sraa	Since your dad is going to have to pay for the dog, it's food & supplies, and vet bill, he's got to make the ultimate decision. If it's gonna be your dog, you have to take care of it for the next 15 years, and by then, you'll probably be going off to college or moving out. The whole family has to be on board, because young people often have obstacles along the way where they can't take the dog along. Get a hamster for now, and wait on the dog until you can afford to get one on your own.|`|pzOtPr9Vaa	This is what my sister did and it worked like a charm. Simply tell your parents that if you don't get a dog soon, when you go off to college the dog will still be there with them! Say this and "Santa" will be bringing you a new puppy at Christmas!|`|t8ZL4F6Xaa	Unless you can pay the puppy and all his expenses, it really wouldn't be your dog. Who would take care of it while you are at school? If you are under 16 who would take it to the vet and who would go get it's food? Do you plan to be home at night and play with him and walk him a couple of times a day and take him out to go potty. Most responsibility of pets fall to the parents. If they do not want a pet is it really fair to the animal to be resented by the parent who didn't want it in the first place? I got a puppy for my little girl ( she's 3 ) but I know that it is MY dog. He is our family dog but when I got him I knew I would be the one taking care of him and paying for him. Having an animal is much like having a child give yourself time and when you are older you can get one then. maybe you and your parents could find a compromise. An animal that requires less time and attention.|`|wzb9sL9Jaa	My first question is how old are you? If you go to school, have a job, have homework ect just who is going to look after your pet? Dogs need a ton of time spent with them. They need to go for walks often. In the middle of the day night whenever "nature calls". Owners also need to be able to properly care for them. Vet bills can be very costly and dont kid yourself spaying /neutering a animal is a must. Shots, food the list goes on and on. Are you sure you are ready for this sort of 10-15 year commitment? If you do your research on costs and care of a animal and you can tell your Dad in real terms about how you are willing to take care of a dog maybe he will relent. But I wouldnt count on it.
pg8xpQZSaa	I don't know if this will help you, but it really helped me. My instructor told me that we would start with half-seat canter only. You'd be surprised how much it DOES help. It helps you learn to feel the particular horse's rhythm and the curve of his canter. Then, when you go to sit it you can focus on following the rhythm you previously followed with your heels in the half-seat. :) I just remember the feeling of my heels dipping with the horse's body, so when I sat I kept the motion and was able to sit deep and quiet.|`|meyvIZVzaa	When I began, I was in an english saddle and I was told to hold onto the front of the saddle just until i felt the rithem, it also helped me keep my butt in the saddle. Maybe also try bareback riding, walking and trotting. When you trot, you will eventually get the rithem of sit-trotting and I think that would help yo keep your but down in the saddle.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Have you ever tried riding bareback at a walk?  This helps you learn to balance with your upper body and thighs.  You would be surprised on how well this will help you stay balanced at a canter with a saddle.  If you don't feel confident to ride bareback then try this with a saddle:<br>  <br>  Have someone lunge your horse with you on him, once he goes into a canter use your hips and thighs to mimic the horse motion, it will feel like a rocking motion.  Don't balance on the bit, the person lunging him should have complete control on the horses pace so you won't have to worry and can focus on your position.  Try this for a few lessons, once you feel confident try cantering him in the arena without the lunge.<br>  <br>  The above comment is right. Sit deep! this will also help your horse from going too fast.|`|cVvYirkgaa	wear chaps to help you stay on|`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	Don't forget to breathe!  Keeping your breathing even will help your body to relax into the horses movement, concentrate on sending all your weight down into your heels.  I learnt to canter on the end of a lungeline, my instructer stood in the middle, and it was really easy because I didn't have to worry about keeping the horse going forward, as she did that for me, at least to begin with until I got my seat right and tight, then I was allowed to go on my own...*shrug*...just a thought :)|`|Yr5zBsIHaa	well i had that problem too but it was worse for me i fell off ... so my instructor put me on a western saddle until i felt comfortable doing it in western i moved too English and what i did was hold on to the main and after that i built up my leg mussels and now i can sit the canter almost perfectly on the most bumpiest horse at my stable. |`|qVLgobrRaa	Sit deep in the seat and drop all the weight through your legs down in your heels and lean back. At first you can hold onto a grab strap and attaches on the sides of the pommel. It will help you learn the feel of the canter and how to sit it.|`|nh6OAH6laa	do it on the longeline, reach your hand to the back of the saddle and hold. Reaching back will push your pelvis forward and encourages you to use your core muscles. 
EJpiaCMQaa	I'd call the vet and see what he/she says.  You might need to take the budgie in for an exam.  Birds tend to hide their illnesses until its too late, so I wouldn't take any chances with the budgies health.  I've had budgies for the past 15 years.  Never had such an experience with mine, but I'd go to the vet for sure if it were me.  I want to keep my budgies alive and healthy as long as I can.  Also, please be more careful with your birds.  Dogs kill budgies and other birds all the time.  And we all know guns can kill, too.  Keep a close eye on the little guy.

QMo9v36Naa	Taking the babies from the momma is the same as kidnapping! Flyers are very protective, concerned mothers, and will search endlessly for their babies after you steal them. To have any chance of taming the babies, you would have to take them very young, and if you did that, chances are they would die - they are difficult to raise, must have a special formula, equipment, etc. PLEASE put the mother and her babies back into the wild where they belong. Flying squirrels can make wonderful pets if you know what to expect from them, They are, of course, nocturnal, so you have to be willing to stay up and play with them a couple of hours each night. After they are past the 'baby' stage, they don't really want to cuddle - they are too busy exploring and chewing on electric cords, antique furniture, and the molding around your doors and windows. The chewing is not really something you can teach them not to do - they are rodents.....they chew, climb trees, and move at the speed of light. <br>  <br>  If you decide you must have a flyer, then buy one that is raised from captive parents and grandparents. The hobby breeders have spent a lot of time breeding for personality, and then weaning the baby and hand taming it for the new owner. In the long run, you will pay less for a hand tamed flyer than you will for all the things you would need to raise the wild ones.<br>  <br>  I run a squirrel rescue, and about 85% of the flyers I take in have been wild caught - people find that they are not what they expected.....the flyers bite and/or run from them and/or won't come out of their nest box when the person is around. There are people that do steal flyers from the wild and sell them. I have closed down a few of them around here, but I always know when another one has opened up - I start getting phone calls about 'vicious flyers'. And I am back to rescuing again. I take them, teach them to be wild again, and release them back to the trees where they ought to be.<br>  <br>  So PLEASE think twice about these babies and mother. They need to be living wild in the trees like they were born to do. Set them free, and look for a hobby breeder to purchase one from. And do a lot of research before you get one, so that you will know what you are getting in to. Go to NFSA (National Flying Squirrel Association) or TSB (The Squirrel Board) and do a lot of reading. These creatures can live for 15 years or more, so this is a long term committment you are considering.|`|qXff2v4qaa	let them all go.  the only reason a wild flyer should ever be in captivity is because it is injured.  the mother will continue to be fierce.  you should not have them if you do not know what you are doing with them.  please, let them all go.  you are most likely overly stressing the mother, and probably putting even the pups in danger.|`|1mhqYyiWaa	squirrels are not meant to be in captivity unless they are hurt...im not sure when but you should let them all go....its not fair to the animal
qXff2v4qaa	you can't just take wild flyers from the wild, and make them pets.  it is wrong.  yes, some people do own flyers as pets, but usually it's because they were rehabbed from the wild when their habitat was destroyed and their mother was no longer able to care for them, or when the babies were injured and not releasable.  there are also a few flyer breeders.  you clearly do not know how to care for the pups, and should not have them in your possession.  it is very difficult to raise and tame a young flying squirrel (especially without experience), and the mother is going to be very fierce and undoubtedly attack relentlessly if you try to go near her babies.  do you even know how to take care of the mother?  she needs special care too.  if you want a southern flyer so badly, you should take the time to research them, and then get one that was raised to be a pet for whatever reason.  not one that you forced into captivity.  you will most likely not get a good pet from this situation.  not to mention that taking them from the wild is most likely illegal.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	You touched them?<br>  <br>  I hope the mother doesn't abandon them.<br>  <br>  I don't think it will be too late since you have touched them already.

That can be behavioral, an indication of pain/odd sensation in that area, or a symptom of systemic disease.  Cats are hard to read, and they are very good at hiding illnesses.

Your cat needs to be taken to the vet! It may be something as simple as very dry skin or another skin condition which is easily remedied, or it could indicate pain. Also could just be a nervous habit, but you need to rule out the other things through a trip to the vet. She's not pregnant is she? Some animals pull out their fur to make a nest before birthing. Even if they are just going through a false pregnancy. Otherwise it could be 'selfbarbering' from stress.

Ltm1pEOiaa	Putting a blanket on him will have no effect on his ability to grow hair, now or ever.  Personally, I'd feed him more hay.  If he's ribby you've either got a worm problem or he's not getting enough food to allow him to spend energy keeping warm.  I understand where the breeder is coming from, you don't want your weanling to be fat but you also don't want him to be underweight.  A blanket will help him keep warm and he'd probably gain a little weight that way without extra food.  If you do choose to blanket, make sure you purchase a WATERPROOF blanket.  Take a look at sstack.com; they have a "junior" line of blankets that are pretty inexpensive.  If he's already 15 hands he's going to be too big for a foal blanket but a large pony blanket (maybe a 70 or 72) would probably work.  If you need to know how to measure for a blanket, here's a link.<br>  <a href="http://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb185/nonommy/sizing_blanket_howto.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb185...</a>|`|oU3jsLKiaa	Yes, blanket him. If he is skinny thats all the more reason to blanket him. He is most likely not going int he shelter because he is scared to go in it. When it is this cold and if it snows or rains for a long period of time and since it is cold out he will be shivering outside cold and if you want him to be warm blanket him and make sure it is waterproof.|`|ObwDCBddaa	I have blanketed my baby since he was born. If he is skinny DEFINITELY blanket him. It is harder for them to be warm with no meat on their bones.<br>  <br>  So my suggestion is to blanket him.|`|TM1rfCBvaa	it depends what you want. if you plan to show him in english shows later on then keep the blanket on! if you leave it on he will have shork easy to groom hair and it is soft too|`|N5Nb3TVJaa	You have an 8 month old weanling who is 15 hands and weighs 600 pounds.  What breed is he?<br>  You need to start packing groceries no him, I don't care what the breeder said, people that say that are the ones trying to cut corners breeding their horses.  Weanlings are supposed to be LEAN not skinny NEVER skinny.   <br>  I would get him a blanket, I lean towards the duck canvas ones they are usually pretty cheap...20 30 dollars you can get them on ebay..just measure him from the center of his chest to the center of his tail.  They are water proof and if he is not in his shelter then he isn't cold.  And also usually what I do is, if it is freezing rain and windy I blanket.  If the horse is shivering they are making their own heat..and generally if you blanket them at that point they will sweat and it will throw them all off.  Horses are made to be outside in the cold.  Make sure you feed him lots of fuel that makes heat when he digests it.  When it's really cold I cut back on grain and feed more hay..alfalfa, whatever and I increase the corn intake in their grain.   It takes more heat for them to digest hay/alfalfa.  But it also takes more calories.  So you, need to think about that too.  Corn is always the best.  <br>  Good luck!!  |`|kMZ2mFNyaa	He's a foal, leave him be.  He's more than warm enough.  If he has a shelter and has enough room to move about freely he will either stand in the shelter when he gets too cold or he will run about to warm himself up.  15F as a chill factor isn't that cold for a foal.  He'll be better off in the long run for having braved it.  Horses that are rugged too soon usually turn into whimps and will need to be rugged their entire life.  His hair will grow to the appropriate length to keep him warm enough.|`|qaiYanF2aa	If he is out with other horses and not just by himself then I for sure wouldn't blanket him. <br>  <br>  I don't think that it affects them beyond this yrs winter coat to be blanketed but it doesn't sound like you have a stall so I'm not sure it would be wise.<br>  <br>  The dangers of blanketing a foal that is out there alone would be if it 'comes part way off' it might spook him into the fence and injuries happen that way.<br>  <br>  Remember though when any animal is subjected to cold weather they need more calories to burn to keep warm so you should increase his feed.  I would probably increase it by half of whatever you are feeding him now on grain and also double his hay ration.  If he doesn't eat it all then cut back a bit.  But feeding him enough so he can use the calories to keep warm is more important, in my opinion, than the blanket.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>

Ai8NrXB8aa	I love Pitties.....wonderful dogs. Don't use choke chains, they take years to master, and then mistakes are *still* made. Take it from someone who used a choke chain the first 6 years of their dog's life, and then had to completely re-train him the *correct* way. (Which was me. I had to do all that.) Get a Halti headcollar. Those work great for pulling. ?|`|mh0QRDE9aa	This type of collar will work if you know how to use it properly.  It needs to be put on a certain way in order for it to be effective.  My advice to you is to work with a trainer in controlling your dog.  We have a pit bull also and since they are very strong, you will need help from some one qualified to show you.  I had a Shepard that did the same thing.  We worked with a professional trainer on training the dog.  It turned out the best dog I have ever had.  I am not fond of a prong type collar. I think that it signals people the dog is not safe to be around people and you need it to control it. |`|8tJPK69iaa	I was told by my trainer that choke collars were inhumane. I had trouble with my lab mix pulling me down the street when we went for walks. I then got a harness ( I think made by Sporn) she doesn't pull anymore. It really just takes a lot of training as well as good equipment.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Only use a choke collar if you are shown how to properly use one by a trainer.<br>  <br>  They can be an effective training tool if used properly.. but improper use can harm your dog.<br>  <br>  Your trainer can show you methods to stop his pulling..  its not just about the collar, you just may need a different approach in your training method.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Try the prong collar.

It'll also help socialize your dog at the same time, which is important in the breed.<br>  <br>  In summary i guess, a choke chain isn't a magic non-pulling key.  Training however, is.  A choke chain can help you do this, but only if you've been taught how.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I don't think you should use a choke collar on the dog because better alternatives available. I've seen a newer style training collar that more resembles a harness, fitting over the dog's nose and neck. When the dog pulls on the leash it applies just a little pressure on their nose which they don't like. It's the one Victoria Stillwell uses for dog training. While I have not used it myself it seems to be a very effective training tool and not as cruel or potentially dangerous as the choke collar. <br>  <br>  Here is some more information and some pictures:<br>  <a href="http://www.kooldawgtees.com/GLhowtofit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kooldawgtees.com/GLhowtofit.h...</a><br>  |`|K7hYJAQfaa	They make other great training equipment besides a choke collar the make anti-pull harness's.

The way to do this is to tell your dog to sit when it seats put a treat at its mouth let it smell it but don't let it eat it yet then tell it to shake and hold your hand out.  Then with that same hand lift the dogs paw with your hand and shake it and say good boy/girl and give it a treat.  Do this for like 10 minutes a day every day until your dog finally learns it.   It usually takes a dog up to 4 days to fully learn this but I had a bull dog to learn the trick in 3 hours.|`|enO7l4cmaa	I taught my female pit to shake. I found a treat that was her fav. Then I would tell her to sit and give me her paw. At first it took a little while but once she got the hang of it, she does it now without me asking. When you first start, when you saw paw or shake, youll have to grab her paw while you say it. Also you should never change the command. Pick either paw or shake and stick with it. Other wise you will confuse the pet! Good Luck!|`|qDXdCBgbaa	this way worked for me:<br>  grab a few small treats<br>  say the command you want to use (shake, paw, whatever)<br>  and hold you hand down and out. <br>  if the dog doesnt give you his paw, reach down and take it and hold it for a second<br>  then let go and ask again<br>  as SOON as he actually does it give the treat.  <br>  practice a few times then let it go for a few hours<br>  then come back to it|`|qjGbhzyyaa	I always just picked up my dogs paw and said shake and gave him a treat or bits of dog food everytime i did it, and it only took him a day to learn
g62woUDQaa	If she was 60 days in June, then in September at the latest she should have had her first pneumabort vaccination.  (My vet recommends the first of the series at 3 months instead of 5)  If you aren't comfortable administering vaccines yourself, that would have been a good time to have the vet recheck her to confirm the pregnancy.  I have had mares that show signs of heat even when they were within a few weeks of foaling, so it's possible that she is in fact still pregnant.  It would be a good idea to have her checked to be sure.  One thing....if she is showing strong signs to the point that she might in fact allow a horse to cover her, and there are geldings in her field that might be inclined to "do the deed", you need to think about separating her because if she were to be penetrated by one of the geldings, it could very well cause her to abort if she is still pregnant.|`|4fbf9b9ca228754a01b38108c157fb83aa	A Mare horse can still be in heat if they are pregnet.

But if your duck knew he was a duck (had duck friends, did duck things) then he probably won't ever be completely happy with chickens.  They will get along - but he will be lonely.  I would say get another duck.  Breed of duck won't matter - just someone he can quack with.|`|Mf7pp5Fuaa	My very first Muscovy, "Donald The Duck," a Blue drake. Donald truly knew his name and came when called. <br>  <br>  <br>  Muscovies are the only domestic ducks that are not derived from Mallard stock. They are a South American species. The original (wild type) coloration is black and white, but domestication has produced many more colors, including white, black, chocolate, and blue. The males are large, weighing up to twelve pounds, with the smaller females reaching only seven (I have heard of one Australian strain bred for market, in which a dressed male reached nearly 20 lb and took two people to restrain). Their feet have strong sharp claws and are built to grasp, so that they can perch on branches. Some people consider them ugly because of the large red warty caruncles above the beak and around the eyes. They are, however, very personable and interesting birds, and quite intelligent. Unlike most domestic waterfowl, Muscovies will often fly up and roost. They fly fairly well, especially the smaller females, but are known more for flying around than flying away! <br>  <br>  The meat of the Muscovy is unlike that of the other domestic ducks. It is not greasy and is much more like veal than like poultry. In Taiwan and Europe they often use the Mule Duck, a hybrid of the Muscovy with Mallard-derivatives, as a meat bird. <br>  <br>  By the age of three months or so, the males are nearly twice as large as the females. I've found that in younger Muscovies, the feet of the males are often relatively larger, but I don't know if you can count on this. <br>  <br>  i'd say get another duck, but it is possible they he may addapt to the chickens what can't really say it depends on him really|`|Zp3dtLQWaa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_Duck<br>  They are my favorite duck,I used to have a whole bunch of them..<br>  Your duck will be fine though,,,don`t worry.
0e4717adeb40245dca1e15c4ff227ed6aa	You're getting yourself in kind of deep. The best thing for an off the track horse is to leave them alone for about 6 months-a year. Track horses typically don't get much turn out and are in a stall almost constantly during their careers. I am less familiar with QH racing than with TB racing, but TBs do know lead changes, QH's probably do as well since changing leads is a favorable racing strategy. However, most of them don't steer very well are are extreemly one sided, because they only run in one direction. Race horses are trained differently than most other kinds of horses. For example, the tighter the reins are the faster they go, so it is important as a rider to have an independent seat and leg from hand. These horses also generally have no idea what the rider's legs are for. They are  not taught collection because the foundation of racing is big, long strides, and it takes about 6 months for a horse to redevelop the muscles in his body in order to be able to comfortably collect without hurting himself. Generally, most of them are pretty hyped up on steroids etc. and they take about 30 days to leave the body. Steroids often create aggression in some horses so it's best to judge their personality until after their systems have had time to clear it of drugs etc. Many of they have bad ground manners because a lot of trainers feel they only need to learn enough to get around track fast and to win, so many of them are mouthy, they kick, and they aren't disciplined for it. If you haven't done it before, it's best to have someone who has done it many times to help you, because it is quite a challenge and it takes longer than you think it will.|`|9GvYRdeJaa	Well, in my experience an ex-race horse is hard to retrain... but with a lot of patience and time it is possible. A race horse is only taught to run and doesn't know anything about leads.. just one lead while their running. No collection or ground work. They don't even know how to turn properly. And they definitely don't know how to stop! For them the jockeys have to balance and hold on by the reins so  race horses get used to running while having pressure on the reins, so don't think that they are going to stop by pulling back on the reins like a regular horse, they learn to stop after the finish line and ride and follow with other horses on the track. I find retraining them in a hack works the best as their mouths are very tough. They are taught to run and run fast and nothing else. They only know to go from a stop or walk to a full out run. And just a word of caution when retraining... Don't wear a crop or you will find it MUCH more difficult as that is what they are used to to get them to go faster on the track... Hope this helps and Good Luck!|`|B392l2mEaa	I have heard that ex race horses are the best for barrels. but you need to teach them to be a horse again before you starting running them. show the horse as much love as possible and do a TON of ground work with him. |`|PsxGhu7Zaa	why dont you just buy a horse that barrel races? this horse obviously likes doing what he did. |`|EU167xpfaa	It's very difficult to re-train them.

The nice thing about an off-the-track horse is that they have been handled since birth, so generally, they are used to bathing, clipping, shoeing, loading/shipping, and also many different kinds of environments. <br>  <br>  I was a barrel racer before joining the track, and here are the things that I found:<br>  *Most have great ground manners--if you have a lead shank and not just a rope lead. But be careful grooming as many will bite and kick.<br>  *Most want to pull into the bit. When we gallop, it's all about weight distribution and the give and take of pressure on the bit. Most horses are on the bit, pulling against the rider's weight. <br>  * Depending on where they were broken as babies, most racehorses DO understand leg cues. <br>  *We tend to do most things with the horse on the left side, including most of our turning :) but that doesn't mean racehorses are "one-sided." We do know how to turn right. :)<br>  *Unles some exercise rider has put the time into it, most are not aware of how to use their hind end as a turning tool (unless they are wheeling around as an evasion. Some are quite good at the dart and dash). Nor are many very educated at turning on the forehand. some can lift off their shoulders as a means of changing "lanes" or moving sideways during a gallop.<br>  *Thoroughbreds understand lead changes, but I don't know about QHs.<br>  *As far as collection, most learn to collect under themselves for a relaxed, balanced gallop and jog. <br>  <br>  I'm so happy that your considering giving a new home and a new career to a racehorse. I think you'll find it worth the effort. Good luck!   <br>  <br>  Expect your horses physique to change once he leaves the track. They go through an ugly stage after they get off all their supplements, and they abandon their training regimen. |`|jQvT6k7raa	others have covered alot, but the main thing will be giving to the bit, i think. racers are taught to race against the bit, to pulling back will make them go faster.|`|1HwyDyD0aa	How difficult the retraining process will be will depend on a couple of things: <br>  1) how he was originally broken - some trainers are good, patient and kind, others just rush to get them racing 2) What kind of exercise riders he had - good hands or bad, patient or cruel  3) What the horse's temperament is like naturally, eg nervous, belligerent, willing, detached, etc.  Some are so willing to re-learn, others will fight you every step of the way.<br>  4) What your abilities as a trainer are.<br>  <br>  I know the thoroughbreds are taught lead changes, some trainers want them galloping with their head tucked in, others don't, some have good ground-handling, others don't.  It's best to assume that the horse knows little to nothing and plan on starting from scratch, that way you won't have holes in the foundation.  Quarterhorses may not be taught lead changes as they run a straight course.  Hopefully some QH racehorse trainers will answer the question.  
3BMBZtDxaa	Nothing is your fault at all!<br>  <br>  It would be your fault if you hadn't insisted on checking things over, if you hadn't have tried. But you tried, you pointed out problems, you were concerned. Part of being a horseperson is making mistakes, in this case you made the mistake of giving up your case. But it no way does that mean you're a bad horseperson! You would be a bad horseperson if you had completely ignored all the signs and went on about your business. It's good that you're concerned!<br>  <br>  Personally, if that happened and I saw as many things as you, I wouldn't have dropped it. I would have persisted and refused to mount until I could quickly check the tack before I mounted. Yes, it may caused a dismissal from class, but I would always put the horse first. In the horse world, people do NOT matter! It's always 100% about the horse and the rider. If I was in your situation, I would have firstly told the stable hand to back off, and take the reins back. I would ask her to let me do things on my own because obviously if he's having some problem it's her fault because SHE tacked him. I would then take the time to personally fix all his tacking problems and check him over. If I was in your position at the point where she was yanking the saddle pad, I would have stood up, told her to leave because obviously she wasn't good with horses if all this was happening, gave her a dirty look, gotten back my reins, then check him over. If my trainer walked in and got mad, and I tried explaining but she shut me up, I would still take the time to check over the tack. If she picked at me and told me to get on, I would tell her nicely no that I feel something is wrong with the tack and I'm double checking. If she told me no, then immediately I would have left the class and switched barns.<br>  <br>  Any barn that doesn't put the horse first is a crap barn. Barns should take great pride in their horses and should always bend their schedule to the horse. Always.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would switch barns. Obviously there are some real issues at this barn, and a snob of a stable hand. This is not a place to improve your riding career or advance your horsemanship. <br>  <br>  But don't worry, none of this was you! It was good that this happened because now you know all of them truly and how they feel about horses and you can get out before it's too late!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|L3VbnH1faa	I love the stable where I ride. It's a small stable with about 10 horses but there are no stable hands and you get lessons with about 3 people per lesson so you get all the attention you need and the instructor there really cares about the horses. if i say i think something's wrong with my horse she lets me check him to make sure everything's okay. you might not like small stables but personally i think they're great so if you're going to switch you might want to switch to a small stable (just my opinion.)|`|2lOY7kmWaa	Wow this is not your fault. There are just some people who insist that they know everything about horses, when in reality then know not that much. Talk to Amy about it becasue this really comes down to a safety issue. You could have gotten hurt from this. Tell that stable hand that horses are very dangerous and should not be stuck in the middle of an "I am better than you argument". Wow this really sucks and if Amy does not listen or takes the stablehands side, i would leave that place. That girl sounds like a brat, and I can relate to that type, but she sounds very extreme compared to the stablehand I knew. I would definatley not let this slide by.<br>  <br>  ~2htoohorse~|`|aw6ypXTQaa	I think that you're being quite hard on yourself. Yes I believe you should have checked the horse's tack but your instructor was out of order. The moment the horse acted out of character she should have reassessed it. The stable hand was cruel and I would like to give her a slap for her cruelty. Don't beat your self up but next time re-check the tack so you can be sure that t won't cause the horse a problem. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. x|`|iMsh4ZhOaa	Are they BHS registered?

As soon as you saw your horse tacked up, you should have quickly looked, seen the problem with the blanket, and fixed it quietly without confronting the other woman.  Had she not tacked up the horse, you'd have been late anyway (with a great excuse), so taking the extra moment then would have avoided the whole problem.<br>  <br>  If she's snooty and dislikes you, she might have done a shoddy job just to irritate you.  Nonetheless, I  would have quietly thanked her. If she was being helpful, she would have been pleased and left you to deal with it on your own.  If she wasn't, she might have been shamed into better behavior.  Either way, it defuses the situation and gets her to go away so you can redo the job properly.<br>  <br>  Had I not discovered the problem until I was mounting, regardless of what the girl or the instructor said I would have hopped off and fixed it.  But then, I'm not real good with authority! ;)<br>  <br>  Finally, we ALL make these kind of mistakes, particularly in stressed moments.  No need for embarassment.  <br>  <br>  For final closure on the incident, I suggest letting us know who you are.  From your writing style, some of us could make a good guess, but that's not the point.  It will reassure others in similar situations that someone respected has the same problems.  It will show your maturity.  And it will help you move on from the embarassment. <br>  <br>  |`|Dvk7Pee0aa	look you should go up t ur insteutor and ask her like an adult to lithen i would like it if this girl didnt do my job i would of tacked the horse up right if she didnt storm in there and do it for me she put the pad on wrong and she wouldnt let em fix it she acts like she can do things better and faster <br>  <br>  and btw she is a stuck up cow i hate it how peaple do things for me it drives me nuts arghhh!@<br>  <br>  <br>  and look if thos stable hands are liike that walk in there and say like this LITHEN up and dont speack [this will take guts]<br>  <br>  dont act like u know everything i can do things just like you just because im a rider and ur a stable hand dosint mean were difrent one thing is one thing if the horse is itrated beacuse of the sadle u dont go no dont fix it u bloody let me fix it u dont have to have a small ego to admit ur wrong and u all act like u have huge egos that cant admit that ur wrong<br>  somthign like that<br>  <br>  but they need talking 2 if they continue to do it when u live talk to them like ur an adult and there idiots =D|`|EwtGmpquaa	Nothing is your fault, just know that not everyone on the world is perfect and everyone will make their occasional mistakes.<br>  <br>  You do have somewhat of a right to be upset, because it had to happen, basically when it shouldn't have.|`|Sh0IBwClaa	As far as I am concerned, you have an absolute RIGHT to be upset about what happened.

This girl was putting you, and the horse, in a very dangerous situation.  She must be very insecure in her abilities or she would have just let you adjust the saddle.

If you've been there four years and she is new, she may need someone to explain the business to her.  They won't have any if she keeps bullying the students and being pushy.  I hate when people insist that everyone must do things their way.  It shows great lack of experience and insecure issues.

It's *healthy* bird behavior.<br>  <br>  Birds in the wild spend their days hunting for food sources, keeping track of the flock, avoiding predators and then looking for a safe place to spend the night.  In our homes, toys occupy their time.  A bird without toys will spend its time wrecking the furniture or the drywall or, if it can't wreck that, may turn to chewing its own feathers.<br>  <br>  Delight in the fact that your bird seems well-adjusted and happy and IS wrecking its toys!  And consider yourself fortunate that you don't have to supply toys for a hyacinth macaw :-)<br>  <br>  Colette<br>  ParrotletsPlus<br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/ParrotletsPlus/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Parro...</a>|`|ZGFXBie9aa	That is what birds do... and why you give them the toys in the first place.<br>  <br>  Some birds are more playful than others, and destroy toys faster.<br>  <br>  Try getting a few of those indestructable toys (bullet proof plastic) for her to play with... but make sure to keep providing those wooden ones for chewing on and shredding.<br>  <br>  Maybe consider making your own toys out of drilled, untreated wood (like birch, poplar, pine) to save yourself some money.|`|pH1Qz6lAaa	The bird is bored. You need to play with her...cockatoos are just like any other bird. They needs lots of love and social interaction. Toys are boring no matter how mnay you buy unless they have something else to do all they will do is destory things.|`|DJa2wS86aa	 her chewing is natural it keeps there beak trimed and they get a big kick out of it .they are a bird that chews a hole in a tree to nest even that little bit of info might help ,but stop her i dought it|`|INx9I81Qaa	I'm guessing that you are talking about a Goffin's Cockatoo.  I have a G2 that was abused and now he won't touch an toys he makes pretty much no noise and sits in his cage all day.  He won't interact with me or any of my family.

4R34sXT2aa	Bonjour,<br>  <br>  Tout est bien qui finit bien. Vos deux compères n'ont pas fini de vous étonner.<br>  <br>  Il est très rare qu'un chat adulte ignore longtemps un chaton car sa présence intrigue, même si ce dernier empiète sur son "territoire". De même, il est très rare qu'un chat attaque un chaton dans l'intention de lui faire mal. Tout au plus quelques coups de papattes, des feulements, des grognements mais cela va rarement plus loin. Sous réserve, bien entendu, que nous n'intervenions pas dans "leur découverte" mutuelle et que les présentations se fassent avec un minimum de précautions. Notre r?le consiste alors à superviser les rencontres et le jeu est un excellent moyen pour les amener à communiquer.<br>  <br>  Votre idée de la boule d'aluminium a été excellente, mais elle n'est pas sans danger car en jouant avec, en déchiquetant (par jeu), ils peuvent (surtout le chaton) en avaler involontairement.<br>  <br>  Depuis plus de dix ans des chercheurs ont pu démontrer que c'est l'aluminium qui est la cause des lésions du système nerveux central trouvés à l'autopsie des personnes atteintes d'Alzheimer, démence, chorée, autisme, ou sensées être atteintes de MCJ (maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jacob). <br>  L'aluminium est l'anti-agglomérant dans les pots de sel fin de table. Les antiperspirants peuvent contenir l'aluminium pour son effet de bouchage des pores de la peau. <br>  <br>  Le Dr Garnier du Centre antipoison de Paris, a écrit dans le Concours Médical de février 1997 "Chaque vaccin inocule 1.250 microgrammes d'aluminium sous une forme très difficile à évacuer du corps". Il y a eu une recrudescences de l'ESB suivant les campagnes de vaccination. (Source The Sunday Télégraph du 9 mai 1999).<br>  <br>  Or les amis des chats, pour la plupart, savent que le métabolisme de nos amis à 4 pattes évacue mal certains toxiques. En effet, il leur manque une enzyme : la glucuronyl transferase (quelque chose comme ?a) qui leur pemettrait de rendre les toxiques solubles dans l'urine et donc de les éliminer. Par exemple pour un toxique donné on aura une élimination de 50-60% pour l'homme et le chien et de 3% pour le chat. <br>  <br>  Certaines toxines s'accumulent de ce fait dans le foie et les reins, souvent de manière sournoise car le chat n'a pas l'air souffrant, tandis que d'autres sont foudroyantes (je ne les citerai pas ici pour éviter de donner des idées à certaines personnes). Pour cette raison, il ne faut jamais donner de médicaments humains, ni utiliser d'huiles essentielles pures, ni d'anti parasites destinés aux chiens.  <br>  <br>  Avant de conna?tre cette information, je faisais comme vous, car c'est très dr?le de voir un chat jouer avec de petites boulettes d'aluminium. Depuis que je connais les risques, j'ai remplacé les boulettes par du papier fin (genre pelure), qui fait autant de bruit, si ce n'est davantage, que l'aluminium et mes chats s'amusent tout autant.<br>  <br>  J'espère de tout mon coeur que vous arriverez à retrouver twist et qu'elle aussi partagera bient?t les jeux de vos deux petits chenapans. Excellente fin de journée et plein de caresses et de calins à eux.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS : Il y a un mois environ, je vivais une situation semblable à la v?tre, avec l'arrivée d'une nouvelle pensionnaire de quelques mois, victimes de "vacanciers". Au début cela a été difficile, la petite se cantonnant à notre chambre et puis, quand elle a pris de l'assurance elle a commencé à sortir, à explorer, sous réserve que mes deux autres chats ne soient pas sur son chemin. En fait c'est surtout elle qui les agressait. Et puis Cheyenne (6 ans) a commencé à la flairer et elle ne s'est pas enfuie. J'ai su qu'elle se sentait enfin en sécurité.<br>  <br>  C'est alors que j'ai pris une ficelle assez longue que j'ai négligement laissé tra?née, et les trois chats ont commencé à jouer. Ensuite j'ai pris une balle de ping pong et j'ai recommencé. Je l'ai fait tous les jours et maintenant ils jouent, mangent et dorment tous les trois ensembles. C'est le paradis.... des chats ....<br>  <br>  A PROPOS DE TWIST : avez-vous pensé à aller voir à votre ancienne adresse ? Si c'est un peu loin, vous pourriez peut-être téléphoner à une ancien voisin en la lui décrivant pour lui demander s'il ne l'aurait pas aper?ue. Il faut savoir en effet que les chats sont souvent plus attachés à leur lieu de vie que leurs ma?tres... et que cette situation est assez fréquente....<br>  <br>  <br>  A PHOEBUS : trop fort .... humour acide, mais vous avez certainement compris que cette personne après la perte de l'une de ses amies à 4 pattes a eu l'opportunité de s'occuper d'un chaton et était angoissée que son autre chat ne l'accepte pas ...|`|OAAmAE8iaa	je suis tres heureuse pour toi<br>  ca doit etre un moment magique que tu as vecu aujourd hui<br>  j espere que tu en auras tres vite un autre|`|YIP6l9Zkaa	Super !!

L22hVXTIaa	I did try it on our Pom who used to get very car sick and it didn't work that well.  It actually seemed that his digestive tract was a little worse for a day or two after.  What I started doing - this may sound silly - but I put his little bed on the floor of the back seat - between the door and that hump on the floor.  That way, it didn't move around at all and he couldn't see out.  Some believe that seeing the scenery whizz by causes some of the upset.  I also make sure that I don't feed him anything for 3 hours prior to a long journey - we travel a lot.  After that, he hasn't been sick a single time.  I realize that the 3 hour no feeding thing might be hard to do when you just want to make a quick trip somewhere, but it's worked for my little guy.|`|ztMeGHY0aa	Don't know but I heard someone on the telly say the best way to get a pup or dog out of getting car sick is to do this.<br>  <br>  Put her in the back seat of the car and sit with her for 10 minutes without starting the engine.<br>  <br>  Do this several more times for the next few days<br>  <br>  Then put her into the front seat.(Not sure why the front seat except I feel better in the front seat as I get car sick too)<br>  <br>  Then start up the car and just sit in it for a short while say 5 minutes <br>  <br>  Do that again and again<br>  <br>  Eventually go around the block <br>  <br>  Go around the block again another time and the person on the tv said things should be fine from then on.<br>  I really hope this helps you and your pup It will only take a week and you won't have to give/pay for drugs|`|d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	My doctors wont prescribe it.  They suggest a dose of Dramamine ~30 minutes prior to travel (you would have to get the proper dosage from your vet).  Also, not feeding the day of travel may also help. There are some dogs (and cats) who just do not adjust well to car travel, no matter how often you try to desensitize them.|`|AA10283947	Funny enough there was a chap on TV the other day speaking of this very subject .<br>  He said get into the back of the car with the dog for a few times each day without going anywhere, then move to the front for a few days, again without doing anything.<br>  Then after a week or so sit there and turn on the ignition but again, stay put, letting the dog become used to the engine.<br>  After a few periods of this, drive the car a few times around the block, soon the dog will enjoy his car trips... tail wagging. <br>  Good luck.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	cerenia works very well for motion sickness, but the dose is double what it normally is when used for vomiting.
p3vjvzRPaa	Let me stay up front that I have never seen anything quite as bad as this before but here's my thoughts...<br>  <br>  She is standing very straight and doesn't have normal angulation in the rear legs, but she also has more angle of croup in the photos than is normal in a dog of her type.  (Croup is the section of the back that runs from the hips to the base of the tail).  She appears to be hunched up - she isn't holding herself normally.<br>  <br>  My guess (and that's all it is) is that there is some problem either in her back or hips that are causing her discomfort and making her stand stiff legged.  OR she's simply got poor angulation and that will likely cause her problems over time.<br>  <br>  I also have to say that it is not normal for a dog to be uncomfortable when they get up, even if they've been lying for a long time.  That also suggests she has a problem that needs attention.<br>  <br>  She looks like a shepherd/cross.  They can have hip problems.  I imagine her parents were not hip scored.<br>  <br>  The fact that she still runs doesn't mean much - my dogs will run around without any limps even when they've had bad injuries.  Some dogs have a high threshold for pain I reckon, or just put it aside when they are having fun.<br>  <br>  Bottom line - something is not right and she is probably in pain.  Go to the vet.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  AFTER YOUR ADDITIONAL INFO:<br>  Even if she is only sometimes stiff after lying down, that is still not normal, regardless of whether you thought she was lying in an awkward position or not.  Even my elderly dogs aren't ever stiff after lying down, *unless* there is something wrong with them (like an injury or arthritis) that causes them to be in pain.<br>  <br>  What you call 'stiffness', I would probably call 'pain'.<br>  <br>  Also, in the photos was she what you call 'stiff' or is that her normal posture?  Cos what I'm trying to say above is that her normal posture doesn't look very normal, if you see what I mean.  I look at the photos and I see a dog that has something very wrong with it  She is either built very 'wrong' or standing in a strange posture due to pain.  <br>  <br>  Hope that makes my answer clearer & that your vet has some answers for you.  <br>  <br>  P.S. Sometimes animal physiotherapists (or chiropractors) can help with this kind of thing better than a vet.  I've been to several doctors about a neck problem but a physio figured it out so I speak from personal experience :-)|`|L22hVXTIaa	She just lacks proper angulation or extension in her hind legs which is a serious fault in conformation.  However, most dogs (I have a rescued Chi with hind legs almost identical to your dog's) have no problem with this. Since she's not a show dog, don't worry about it.|`|tY14vbrKaa	You know, I don't have a solid answer for you, but I see what you're talking about.  She seems to lack that natural reverse angle of most dogs.  Have inquired with your vet?<br>  <br>  I've starred for others.  The "double jointed" theory is probably incorrect, but I'm interested in what others will say.|`|PNLNewgQaa	i don't think dogs can be double jointed.  i have asked other people and they tell me the same.  But one thing that concerns me is that when you dog stands in the pic that her feet are not bent which is not normal so yes get your dog checked out immediately, something might be wrong severly, you can always make payments to pay for the x-rays. you don't have to pay it all at one time. just like if you were to go to the hospital. <br>  my lab's feet bend but other wise to the same thing. <br>  PLUS instead of getting an x-ray have you taken her for a just a simple checkup to the vet, and does it worry them? thank you.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	Whoa...thats crazy!
0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	To me this sounds like a stifle problem.  Just the fact that he's losing balance, this could be deemed an uneveness, which, while he's not lame is still an indication of a problem.  <br>  Is he long in the back?  Arabs can sometimes find it hard to engage behind due to the fact that they have a tendency to be long in the back, so this could also just be a conformation thing.<br>  Also, is he losing his footing on the straight or on a circle or both?  If it's happening on the straight I tend to lean toward the former part of my answer, in which case I'd definately get a vet out to check on him. If it's on a circle I'd go with the latter part of my answer, in which case I reckon it's just time and strength excercises that are needed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and luck to you :)|`|5kUxkun3aa	its had to judge when not seeing it. does he have a prob when not having a lesson. has he got a old stifle injury?|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	sounds like a stiffle situation to me.  the vet can figure it out for sure.  sometimes the stifle's connective tissue's become stretched, or torn, or just inflamed.  i have had some success painting dmso with the hair growth on the stiffle, and a light work immediatly after painting.  heads up, this product should never be used on broken skin.  apply it with gloves.  it will really heat up.  if u see steam coming off the area, it is very inflammed.  again, i suggest talking to your vet before you do anything.  he may prescribe anti inflamatory series, adequan injections (i have had huge success with this on my ex racers...it helps not only with stiffle but all of their joints.), or cortisone. a simple flexion test and he can determine weather its the stiffle or the hock, or the diagonal FRONT leg even.  doesnt sound too bad yet, and hopefully with your good eye and some quick attention he will be alright.  .|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Arabs are known to be short in the back....not long.  They typically have fewer vertebrae than any other breed.  I agree with another poster that this sounds like it could be an issue involving the stifle joint.  It doesn't sound like the usual upward fixation seen in post legged horses.  But it does sound like an instability in the joint.  The function of the patella is to stabilize the joint.  the stifle is actually two joints....the tendinous joint with the patella, and the bony joint of the femur and tibia.  An injury to the tendon of the patella can cause an instability in the joint between the femur and tibia that results in what you are describing.  It should be checked by the vet, and never apply DSMO until you have a difinitive diagnosis.|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	I can almost guarantee you it's a stifle issue and that you should have the vet come out.My horse is a complete loon some days and about a year ago she was in the field(we have some jumps set up in the field she was in)and she was galloping and bucking all over the place and when I tried to exercise her the next day she felt lame and she was slipping also so I got off her and we called the vet and they said something was wrong with her stifle.I don't remember exactly what they said about it because it was a year ago and so I would definitely give the vet a call.Good Luck!
0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	Check for anything that could be hurting him.  He sounds as though he may have a sore back?  Just a thought.  Ponies in general can have quirky temperaments which can make them a little more difficult to train.  I know that 18 inches is not high at all, but it could be that he's not ready to be jumping anything as yet, and perhaps you need to consider going back to regular flat work and ground poles.  3 years is still quite young and while he may have the physical maturity he may not be 'emotionally/mentally' able to cope with the things you're asking him to do.  Again, he's young, those 'random spaz moments' are completely normal for a young horse to experience and indulge in, just don't lose your cool with him, laugh, correct him gently and carry on.  Making an issue out of those kind of moments will more than likely only make him worse.  <br>  My best advice at this stage, give him time.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps:) Good luck,<br>  <br>  Kismet.|`|rPPM5R3oaa	i wouldnt jump a 3 yr old sorry... i would wait until their almost 5 to start jumping and i would pass 18inches untill they were 5. but if your determined to be jumping I would get a trainer to work with the horse.. and pay close attention to those legs since the horse is just  baby.. wrap them when jumping|`|XXHrxO5waa	hey dont want to be rude, but 3 is to young to be jumping its most likely he isnt fully grown or filled out and his legs are very vonurable, and he is also not mentally mature enough, give him some time to grow up then try again|`|Dprk0oV8aa	I have taught many horses to jump. Some of them are perfect angels, some do alright, and some are just brats (and sometimes they are just lazy). It sounds like this horse is a brat (not to be mean) but he just doesnt like to jump. He is either lazy or scared. Some horses get insecure and the only thing they know to do is to fear... so they buck, rear, and have spaz attacks. Have you tried lunging him before you ride him? Leading him over the jumps? Lunging him over jumps? The crop/whip could be scarying him as well. Maybe he just needs to trust you and have your confidence. He is only 3 remember! How did you feel when you first jumped? You realided on your horses confidence to get you over the small 18' jump didnt you? This is not a bad thing... but a bond with a horse takes time! I wish you the best of luck... and dont get too frustrated with him! If I don't praise my horse after she does well on a jump, then she wont do it again. She lives off of praises: maybe your horse does too!<br>  <br>  I really didnt mean to offend you by saying he was a brat.... he just doesnt do as you say!|`|5TCewPYRaa	Umm I ride western and I barrel race...but I am thinking that 3 years old is a really young age to be starting a horse on jumping...especially over a foot...I mean I am training a 3 yr old who is destined to be a barrel horse...but I have spent the last 5 months making him into a pleasure horse and working on collection, extension, side passing and flexibility...and anything else ...but barrel turns...I wouldnt dream of it right now...I think 3 is way to young to be putting that much pressure on a horse...not just physically, but mentally as well....they are still very much immature and can get scared and are unpredictable...I am even cautionary at a lope or a canter with my guy...<br>  If you want him to have a good, long career, maybe back off a little...take him back to the basics for a year or so...teach him how to control every aspect of his body of you...his head,shoulder,barrel and rear...in that you will be able to fine-tune him at every stage as he comes along...instead of hurdling him at an obstacle and whipping him over it...that is not training...that is scaring....no wonder he bucks and spazzes...he has NO clue what you want because he is not yet mentally capable of it...thats why so many people have psycho barrel horse...because they assume that if you run an extremely fast horse at a barrel and jank its face off with a gag bit, it is going to be a world champion...which is the opposite of the truth...<br>  <br>  I'd say trot poles and possibly loping over poles once you have him perfected with the trotting ones (remember you have to re-space the lope poles...) is about all he should be doing...and if your trainer is whipping him over jumps as a 3 year old...maybe you should consider firing him/her and getting a real trainer who knows what they're doing.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: "When your horse says no, you either asked the wrong question, or you asked the question wrong" Pat Parelli<br>  I believe that you are: <br>  A) Asking him the wrong question, as in saying you are going to go over this jump, even though you dont understand my weight shifting or body cues..<br>  B) You are asking it in the absolute wrong way: You are saying run and jump or get hit...instead you should explain what he is to do and then ask for it...at this age you should never demand anything from him as in whip him...because he is still learning and it would be like you getting beaten or spanked everytime you didnt get a math question right...even if you had just started learning it and you were really confused about it...
Um8osMNuaa	Chocolate Labs are a little thick, l know from experience.<br>  <br>  <<<<<<<<  My Milly.<br>  <br>  They are bred from show dogs for their looks, and not working dogs, so they have all the looks but none of the brains. Have you ever seen a chocolate guide dog? Lots of black and yellow, but very rare to see a chocolate one. My Milly is now 3 years old and very calm, although she can have her daft moments, she's very loyal and affectionate, she's like my shadow, she follows me everywhere, my yellow one is a little more independent and not as clingy.<br>  Although all Labs are very energetic and need lots of exercise, especially when they are puppies, but with training they become well behaved dogs, very loyal and great family dogs, even the chocolate ones...LOL<br>  They do calm down as they get older, although you can always get the odd one that doesn't, at 4 and a half months he has a lot of growing to do, having him neutered will help to calm him down.<br>  Chocolate ones may be a little sillier than the other two colours, but they're my favourites.|`|FcHplZtQaa	I agree, I have 2 chocolate Labs, my oldest one is 6, the other one is 5mths, she's my oldest ones pup!<br>  <br>  Both dogs are mad, especially the puppy, my oldest one was like a great big puppy till she had her first litter at 4, even now she's still a bit nuts sometimes.<br>  <br>  Great dogs though!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Its yellow labrador not golden<br>  <br>  And regardless of color a lab, which is a hunting dog/sporting dog, will be hyper. All sporting dogs are highly energetic. Labs love clowning around. YOu have a puppy they are all loopy at that age. They were bred to be able to work in water all day long, of course they need energy. Most sporting will never grow up and will never lose that puppy energy.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is get the dog in obedience. Also try taking the dog to some where he can swim to burn off energy.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	I've had a lot of labs in my lifetime, and a black or yellow puppy can be every bit as "loopy" as a chocolate. However we did have a chocolate that we called "thud" (you know, the sound they make when they crash head long into the wall) However we also use to have a black that we named "Taso" (George Eliot's dirty 4 letter word from "The Lifted Vail"), and yes, she was the puppy from hell.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  "They are bred from show dogs for their looks, and not working dogs, so they have all the looks but none of the brains."<br>  <br>  Ah-WHAT!<br>  <br>  This CHOCOLATE Lab was a decedent of  both 3x national champion "Super Chief" and 5x national champion "River Oaks Corky"<br>  <a href="http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/blunderpic/dogs/Picture050.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/blunderpic/dogs/of50323442.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...</a><br>  <br>  How is this for a CHOCOLATE with "none of the brains"<br>  <a href="http://www.retrieversonline.com/banchee.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.retrieversonline.com/banchee....</a><br>  <br>  BTW Chip's sire was NFC Storms Riptide Star (also a chocolate lab)<br>  <a href="http://www.windcreekkennels.com/1996nfc.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.windcreekkennels.com/1996nfc....</a>|`|3c0caaa2a4af31674ac41b5023c3c503aa	My chocolate lab is now 1 year old and he is the same way, he knows right from wrong very smart, (to smart) and does allot of this for attention, I was told that when they turn 2 years old they calm down some we will see but for now, we just have fun with our rambunctious pup. Good Luck!!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	All Labradors are loopy.  You need to TRAIN them.  The guide dogs are highly trained and get lots of exercise.|`|L22hVXTIaa	All Labs, regardless of color, are very high energy dogs and they all love to be clowns!  And, he's only four months old!!!  It sounds like you and your dog could benefit from some basic obedience classes and he's the perfect age.  Also, you should be taking this guy out EVERY day for a nice LONG walk or two.  He's got energy to burn, so it's very hard for him to settle down and mind.  Exercise and basic obedience are the keys.|`|H3J6bN0Yaa	He must have two good walks a day (at least half an hour each) as well as play sessions. They are a working dog so have high energy levels. <br>  What food do you feed him? Some brands are high in colours and preservatives or protein and this can make them hyper. Dry complete foods are better than meat and it should be a good quality puppy food like James Wellbeloved, Burns, Hills etc. Make sure you aren't feeding a working dog food as you don't work him. Stay clear of supermarket food. You are what you eat - same for dogs. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uDOVf2vvaa	They are high energy and they need to burn it off. You need to walk as much as you can and take him to a dog park so he can play. Also they love the water and to jump in and case balls, when we did this with ours it wore him out enough so we could get some peace.They will eventually learn no just keep at it. I know right now it seems over whelming, but it's worth it in the end. They calm down some around 11/2 or 2 years. If you work with him training and exercising you'll get a dog you'll love forever.|`|4KTmiQ0paa	I'm not sure why it's just chocolates that are loopy, but, as seen in Marley and Me, it can happen to other types of labs too. Just be sure to watch him and give him lots of exercise. If he continues to do something after you say no, put him a crate for a few minutes and ignore him if he starts to whine. Don't let him out when he's whining, even if his time is up. It's heartbreaking to listen to, but better for him (and you) in the long run.|`|s9haCi64aa	Its called training. The colouring has nothing at all to do with it. He is 4 and half months old if he isnt stimulated he will find his own entertainment. Labs are very high energy and need at least 1-2 hours a day as adults.<br>  <br>  I suggest you enroll in training classes and get that boy some exercise, at least 30 mins for his age and im not talking walking around the block I mean free running on a long line|`|cNEsrLUJaa	Maybe that's his personality hyper active or maybe hes been eating something he shouldn't some people say dogs can get hyper coz of lack of exercise<br>  :P...|`|8yvQzy9Saa	Because there brains are in there stomach......|`|EJqsqnZFaa	We have had several purebred labs over the years and it does seem that the chocolates seem to be a bit different then yellows and black labs. I really dont have a reason for it, I can only imagine that there is a gene on the same allele as the chocolate color that makes them have unusual personalities, like red cats. I have met quite a few beautifully bred ch. labs that were borderline aggressive. I dont think the aggression had as much to do with the color as it did with lack of exercise though, My friend has a lovely ch. lab that came from a very notable breeder, he wonderful but he has several strange traits, like pointing. My friend takes him goose hunting and he will point like a trained pointer. He asked some of the other lab owners at the gun club and they said that certain lab bloodlines have produced "pointing labs" over the past decade, he had several offers to breed him but decided not to add to the overpopulation problem and had him altered. <br>  Good luck with your lab, get him plenty of exercise and he will be fine. Labs tend to take quite a while to "come into themselves" just like golden retrievers, if you can wait out the puppy stage (about 5 years haha) you will end up with the greatest dog you have ever owned!|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Chocolate labs do seem to be more loopy than yellow or black ones, but they are very intelligent and can be trained well! Which is why labs are great for guide dogs. You can train him to be more well behaved but he is always going to be a high energy dog. Just make sure he gets plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to tire him out.|`|X4NIyjUkaa	i have a chocolate lab,gurman shepard dog,and a gray-hound all mixed together and she can be wild but if we want her to stop we yells at her to stop and she is down right the best listener in the world.|`|rKcrAKxRaa	labradors are known for being one of the friendliest type of dog / the least likely dog to ever bite<br>  <br>  it depends on the age and whether or not the dog has been neutered or not<br>  the dog is a puppy, so he'll still be learning about the world around him<br>  this should be a joyful time, but stressful and frustrating if he is being difficult to train. look for a dog trainer or ask a more useful friend to give you a hand
ZExm4EUmaa	Hi there<br>  <br>  Would agree with a lot of whats been said, once you have ensured his teeth are ok and saddle fits well, would start again with him, and train him like he knows nothing.  From the sounds of it, he might have been a bit confused/testing his boundaries and now is getting in the habit. I know you said he has been a b.racer for a bit, but you can basically treat him like a horse off the track, and train him the same way you would a TB straight off the track.<br>  <br>  Go back to the beginning with him, give him lots of turn out time and when you work with him do heaps of ground work, walk him in a halter and teach him voice commands and lunge him in a bridle and get him going to the voice commands. This will help when you ride, can keep your leg aids very soft and use seat and voice commands to change gaits.  When mounted do a lot of walk/trot/halt transitions and bending but try to do loose, large circles and work your way down (or up depending how u want to look at it :P) to the 20m circles.<br>  <br>   I got my TB off the track and he was sooo stiff, he wasn't used to being able to bend after all that running in a straight line with his head in the air!  Remeber too, race horses are not used to lower leg aids, so legs squeezing his belly is quite strange and he may not know what its means.  This is where voice commands are really helpful, gentle ?alf squeeze and 'terr-rot' and if he has learnt what 'terr-rot' means he will learn that, gentle calf squeeze means that too.<br>  <br>  Keep your lessons short as well, 20-30 minutes, keep it simple, and take it slow, he will get there in the end. Maybe take him out for rides to keep things interesting, and do some cross rails or trot poles.<br>  <br>  Can't speak for all of them obviously, but both the young ex race TB''s I have had, have gone through a similar thing.  Have been going really well for a while but then have started to act up.  This is when I back off with their training because its ussually a sign thats its become just too much new stuff for them to deal with, they are young and trying to learn but its all too different, so they tell you in the only way they can.  Slow its down and go back to lessons that are easy for them then start the new stuff again and they tend to be fine :)<br>  <br>  oh, and put him in an eggbut snaffle maybe? even nicer on the mouth than the loose ring. And make sure its fits him ok? (i am sure you have done this but just in case :)<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|WavHql0Eaa	maybe he doesn't like being ridden english and he likes being ridden western (if thats what he was ridden before because of the barrel racing and....ya) try a western saddle idk|`|LzXZQBHbaa	Have some fun with him...he might just be bored. Take him on a ride Out of the ring.<br>  <br>  Edit...forgot to mention, get him checked for ulcers.|`|4x5JPs8qaa	We retrain a lot of exracers and most have back problems of some sort he is probably out of adjustment . |`|4fd61aa12bd580a01c2f3784f70c97d2aa	I would deffinatly have a vet check his back, and Knees. Our horse started this kind of issue and we found that she had several vertibra that where out in her back. good luck|`|7XIy9Wvxaa	Here's a question i didn't see asked or answered.<br>  Has your trainer/instructor or anyone else ridden him at all and did he act the same for them? <br>  If he did then I would suspect a physical cause for these issues and hunt around for a vet who specializes in lameness diagnosis. You may want to have x-rays taken.<br>  If he goes great for them then I suspect this all comes down to you needing to hone your abilities. A lot of the behaviors you describe can be attributed to a horse reacting to a rider who needs to work on their balance and softness.|`|LAl0eDPzaa	You need to go back to the very basics of riding - ground work, and preferably in a round pen with no tack on, no bridle, no halter.  He needs to be worked both ways without a lounge line on, just your signals....do a search online for John Lyons methods.  I've had to tackle rank, never broken TB studs, and this ground work brought them into focus without hurting either me or themselves.  If they got 'stupid' they had to work that much harder and longer.  Getting to stop, and approach me on their own was their reward - with lots of patience, no yelling, no anger at all.  No frustration - just constant, consistent work, reward, etc.  Once the ground work has been done for a couple of weeks (depending on the progress of the horse) then tack him up, but work him from the ground before riding him - just don't over do in one particular day, and sour him.  It's all in the giving and taking between you and him.  Neither of you will always be right.  If you don't communicate to him in exactly the same way, asking for the same result everytime, he WILL become frustrated because he's trying but you're not giving clear, concise, consistant signals.  |`|N5Nb3TVJaa	Do you do anything else with him other than school him and take lessons on him?  While we as humans think riding ANY riding is fun and can't get enough of it, a lot of horses get burned out schooling schooloing schooling..or as they probably see it working working working..all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.  <br>  Maybe you should measure him and get an accurately fitting saddle?<br>  Maybe you are putting too much leg on him, I had a horse who hated being squeezed, try another cue maybe?  <br>  Try just going to hang out with him..brush him..feed him treats...ya know just be his buddy..maybe just take him for a ride with a halter and lead bareback..just let him tool around..with no cues..no needing to this perfect or that perfect let him graze and generally just be a horse??  |`|xrU3MPoMaa	i agree with the answer above me, check his teeth. when i got my horse, she said the vet checked his teeth in june and said they were fine (this was in september).. then my friend (who knows a lil more than us) came out to see him, and said he felt a little sharp. then when we brought him home, he tossed his head and was like he was in pain.. turned out it was his teeth and he's great now.. so have the checked, a year is a long time|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I would try him on a Dr. Cook bitless bridle.  I've seen and heard of amazing changes in horses like this one when switched to the Dr. Cook.  It is definitely worth trying.  My horses go very well on it, and many problem horses are miraculously cured when the bit is no longer there to deal with.|`|db9ce3362907a136acac0610fae4357eaa	My first instinct on reading your question was that he was having problems with his teeth.  You said they were done last year, I would have them checked just in case, they may need to be floated again.  If his teeth are definitely not the issue and he is not having any soundness or soreness issues, or saddle fitting issues, then you may be asking him for too much too soon.  Maybe take things a little slower and go back to a point that he was comfortable at.  Work at that level for a few days and start reintroducing new things at a slower pace.  Some horses take longer to pick up new stuff and will get frustrated if you are pushing them too hard too fast.  If he was mine, I would begin by doing ground work with him for about 30 minutes each day before I rode him and then just long trot and long lope him the first couple of days, not really asking for anything.  If he is comfortable at this stage, then ask for simple maneuvers at the walk and trot, building on that until you get him back to a point that he is comfortable and ready to learn something new (or relearn things you have already worked on).  Good luck and remember patience is always the key to working with horses.|`|4zsvYuB1aa	First, he needs his teeth done again. If your using rolkur, stop IMMEDIATELY. If you haven't used rolkur and your dentist says  nothing is wrong, you should send him to a trainer. Right now, it sounds like he needs his teeth done. A horse needs to get their teeth done every 6 months to 1 year.|`|1uR2zPnEaa	you know tb's sometimes get attitude problems when they've been doing something they are comfortable with and you change their routuine to something else they throw fits like kids<br>  <br>  my horse is a bucker and head nodder (dont think i could handle a rearer lol be careful!!!)<br>  <br>  but yeah get a vet check and make sure everything is fine and then consider it an attitude problem.. maybe he's not sound for jumping? and it causes him pain? maybe he jsut doesnt LIKE it!<br>  <br>  you two are not getting along.. does he push you around?<br>  are the you dominant of the two?? or is he?<br>  maybe he doesnt see you as his dominant human and wants to have his way tb's get VERy horsey and like to test... (i kinda like it about them) my tb got like this the 2nd month i had him.. they dont like to work and maybe jumping is too much work for him.. you have to be VERY patient and take things slowely dont start jumping training too fast and take a break and maybe jsut hack out my horse lOOOVES his trail ride his ears perk and he even has a little hop in his step ( a happy hop not a spooked hop lol)  so take a break and see if you see a change in his demeanor?  <br>  <br>  just letting you know that might be an option if he is in good health and is fit and sound for jumping thats how my horse is and he's an ottb as well  |`|6DSgr6fraa	ummm what I would do Its get a professional saddle fitter out to have a look. He will can re-flock your saddle to make it fit your horse better or he might tell you it just completely doesn't fit him! Lol I would get his teeth done again too.<br>  Do you get riding lessons? Maybe there is something about your riding he doesn't like? I've never seen you ride so Im not critising your riding at all! But I don't know maybe you kick too much or pull back on the reins too hard?<br>  I would also try lunging a lot and lots of natural horsemanship ground games to help you out!<br>  If all this fails then definitely go to the vet, he could be very sore!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!!!|`|RloOJ43haa	Even though you say you have changed you saddle twice, I think saddle fit may still be an issue here. Have you actually worked with saddler? TB's are notoriously hard to fit for saddles as they tend to have high withers. Have a saddler out to check your fit. The saddler can also re-flock your saddle for a semi-custom fit. <br>  <br>  Also, most horses need their teeth done twice per year - not every other year - so try having his teeth floated.
0m6BgESXaa	Watch - I know you didn't ask for this command, but it's an important one.  If you don't have eyes, you don't have ears.  Start by holding a cookie in front of your face and say "Puppy, watch me!" The moment your pup looks into your eyes (not the cookie, but YOUR EYES!) say "Yes!" and give them a treat!  They will start by only looking at you for a split second, so be quick!  By teaching your puppy to focus on you, they'll tune in better and be willing to listen.  In the end, you want something that looks like this:<br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/Xepherya/StraussWatch2.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/Xepherya/StraussWatch3.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/Xepherya/StraussShow.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/Xepherya/StraussShow1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/Xepherya/Ranger.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u222/...</a><br>  <br>  Sit - To teach sit, lure your puppy into it with a cookie by putting the cookie just in front of or on your puppy's nose.  Gently slide the cookie "back".  The rule of thumb is when the head goes up, the butt goes down.  Tell your puppy "sit!" right before his butt hits the floor.  Say this only ONCE!  Do not repeat.  Repeated commands breed a puppy that ignores, or obeys inconsistently (sometimes sitting the first time, other times sitting the fourth time, etc).<br>  <br>  Never EVER push down on a growing puppy.  It's bad for growing joints and bones, and they still have open growth plates (bones with gaps between them).  It's very easy to hurt your puppy this way.<br>  <br>  Stand - People fail to realize how important a "stand" command is.  Teaching the stand is ridiculously easy.  From a sit or a down, take a cookie and pull it away from the puppy.  He'll have to stand up to get it, and all you'll need to do is tell him "stand".  Why is this command useful?  It keeps your puppy from sitting in mud or a puddle when on a walk, it is VERY useful for examination at the vets office, and it can even save your dog's life!<br>  <br>  Lay Down - Again lure your puppy into it.  I actually recommend starting from a STAND and not a sit so the puppy does not become pattern trained.  Take a cookie and place it near the puppy's nose.  Gently bring the cookie down and back, so the puppy must put his front down before he puts his back end down.  This is a far more efficient drop than teaching the puppy to "Crawl" forward from a sitting position.  It also teaches the puppy that down means down, not sit then lay down.  They are always allowed to lick and sniff the cookie, even nibble on it, but don't give them the whole thing until they have complied with your command.<br>  <br>  Come - With your puppy on a leash, have somebody else HOLD the puppy for you and walk away (back turned to the dog, do not back away).  Turn around and then run backwards.  With a happy high pitched voice say "Puppy COME!" and bring them into you.  Praise heavily for when they come!  NEVER EVER scold your puppy for coming to you!  Even if your dog runs away from you and you chase it for an hour, the moment you call your puppy and he COMES to you, you praise the heck out of that dog!  You are not rewarding him for running away, you're rewarding him for returning to you!  Also never call your puppy when you are going to do something that he deems unpleasant, such as bathing, clipping nails, or brushing teeth.  Go get him!<br>  <br>  Stay - Start with your puppy sitting at your left side.  Tell your puppy "Stay!" and wave your palm firmly but not provokingly in front of their face.  Slowly rotate so you're nose to knees with your puppy.  Only stay there for a second or two, and then rotate so you're back with the puppy sitting at your left.  Immediately praise if the puppy didn't get up!  If they DID get up, do not yell "No!" or anything of the like.  Just quietly and calmly remind them "Sit!"  <br>  <br>  This takes a very long time to perfect, so don't expect a baby baby to sit and stay for ever and ever.  They'll regress a little in this exercise, but eventually you can solidify it.  Whenever your dog breaks a stay and comes to you, do not say a word.  You are upset that they broke their stay, but you should not be upset that the came to you.  Coming is always a good thing!  And don't back away from your dog.  Backing away looks like "Come chase me!" and it is then YOUR fault that your dog came to you<br>  <br>  No - I would only use no in emergencies.  Too many people say "No!" but don't tell the dog what they're doing.  No what?  If you feel you MUST use no, name the behavior.  No bite.  No jump.  No bark.  I feel however, that is always best to ask for an incompatible behavior.  Tell the dog what you want it to do instead of what it's doing wrong.  <br>  <br>  If a puppy is jumping, instead of saying "No jump!" tell it what you want it to do instead.  "Puppy sit!"  Jumping is an incompatible behavior with sitting, thus your puppy stops jumping :-)|`|lFxlYx9zaa	I breed boxers and I always use liver treats.They work wonders, and are good for them as well.<br>  Example: Take a treat and give them a small piece so they know its good. Then take the treat and hold it up over their head, but not to high. As they back up, lean forward and they will sit down. Be sure you give them plenty of praise after they sit to reinforce the behavior.<br>  Once you get them to sit the first time start saying sit as you train them. This always works for me, and it can also work for training other areas as well. Just remember to be patient, some dogs take awhile it all depends on the individual intelligence of the dog.OK good luck !!!|`|KyaAdqUpaa	Most dogs are motivated by food. When they do what you ask reward them with a treat. If you can go by your local petstore or who ever does obedience training and see if you can sit at watch without your dog. I know Petsmart does training and it is usually in the middle of the store.|`|WvUy2FwWaa	the first command u should learn is sit try using treats to start with .<br>  get a treat and lift it a bit above his head so he can see it. say sit as well.if that doesn't work try gently pushing his bum down to sit while saying "sit". if he does the first one then don't use a treat but sill put your hand up above his head whilst saying"sit".<br>  try the rest like this with treats <br>  <br>  when u say no to him tell him in a firm voice and you should be fine<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|XMnyOT8Yaa	What kind of a breed do you have? Some breeds are trained easier than others. Basically, some are more willing to please than others which can be stubborn. Just use some treats for motivation, no dog can resist those. And then follow your basic instructions on how to teach a dog to sit, stay, lay down, etc. There are many resources online for this (Google is your friend), even videos on YouTube you can watch.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.k9ring.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9ring.com</a> - Dog Breeders Online Community|`|XacL7v9Xaa	Perhaps if you've sold a pint of your blood you could afford a paperback book on "How to train that puppie".

When they are sitting, i put my hand with a treat in in on the ground in front of them and they lie down as they focus on nudging the treat out of my hand and then i reward them until they understand that too. As far as teaching them no i taught mine by saying it sounding slightly angry even if your not just enough to get them to know they are doing something wrong don't act insane with rage no matter how much they ignore you at first because this will just scare them. I also put my hand on their muzzle firmly (not hurting them) as they were doing the unwanted behavior and this caused them to calm down and focus on me when i was teaching them "no" If you have a small breed i wouldn't do this however or it might just make them nervous.|`|rqIm1Dbyaa	It depends how old your dog is. If he's just a pup then it will be easier then teaching an old dog new tricks. Start with sit. Push down his bum so he is sitting. Then say out loud and clear 'SIT'. Keep repeating this command about 4 or 5 times. then ask him to sit. he proberbly wont do it at first so push down his bum. Then give him a treat. your dog will then relise that if he does it it makes you happy and he gets a reward. Keep repeating it giving him the odd treat now and again. Then he will start to get the hang of it. For lie down it should be the same as sit, just keep repeating. For Come possition your dog away at the other end of your garden. Then suddenly pat your legs and call his name saying come as you do so. The dog will proberbly come. If it does give him a treat. If he doesnt persuade him to come with a treat. Repeat again. Then for stay say stay and stop him from following you as you walk away. If you manage to walk a little way pat him and give him a treat. Repeat getting further away each time. For saying NO when he does something wrong shout loudly NO. He should then look afraid. Keep saying this and if he doesnt respond to no then pull him, tug him. It may hurt a bit but then he knows not to this again. I wouldnt like pulling my dog until a proffesional trainer told me it was the only way. From this you can progress onto more advanced tricks<br>  <br>  I hope I helped and you have lots of fun with your dog xxx|`|yUkFvtudaa	Alot of people will say use treats.  I will ONLY use treats if I want to teach a trick of some kind.  Basic commands are always taught with positive reinforcement.  If your dog doesn't respect you and want to do good and get love from you, he will listen when you only have treats.  I use a choke chain (I hate that name, you're not actually choking them) and leash for all training.  Place them in the position you want, saying the command, if they don't do it, then I use a correction (a little pop of the leash).  When they do it correctly, then praise them up.  Petting them and telling them good dog and get excited when they do good.  They love if you're excited when they do good.  Then calmly repeat the command.  If they get it praise, praise, praise.  If not, then correct.  I have never used treats and won't I'd rather my dog want to listen rather than bribe.  Some cases maybe they are needed to get their attention, but most I've experienced just need direction.  If you're dog runs, you call them and they know you don't have treats, most likely they will not come when called.  If they know if they come back and you will love on them, they will.  Just a suggestion.
L22hVXTIaa	Carrots are good as a treat since dogs like their crunchy texture, but it sounds like you over did it.  Remember, all things in moderation!|`|AA10229248	Carrots won't fix diarrhea, but there's no reason why the dogs can't have A FEW for treats. My dogs get a couple of baby carrots every day, and a whole carrot every now and then. <br>  <br>  Dogs are carnivores so their bodies will not process much of the carrots. It's just a zero calorie treat for them. So yes, what they do eat will pass through their system without being digested.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Carrots are great snacks for dogs, but they won't stop diarrhea....in fact, they could make it worse if the dog isn't used to getting carrots.|`|om4Szik7aa	Eggs are very lite on the stomach and I would maybe give them some until their stools get back to normal. Secondly, I would also only give carrot slices as a treat, and not something to overly give. I hope your dogs get to feeling better soon.|`|1f7k4aJeaa	Vegetables for dogs can be tricky. When you give them too much they will begin to ... fart. Seeing as I own three dogs myself, I have learned.  The farts stink. Carrots are good choices for treats, but try not to overdue it.|`|4KTmiQ0paa	Don't give them too many. Carrots are good, but in moderation. Whenever my dogs have diarrhea, I don't feed them for a day (not out of cruelty, it was vet suggested) and it usually goes away.
4KTmiQ0paa	You have to graduate to only human food. The dog may have some digestive problems if you've been feeding him prepared food. It is suggested that you eventually get to feeding your dog raw meat with fresh veggies such as carrots and cabbage (though the later may give him gas).|`|a1uoxczTaa	I just got off ebay a crap load of dog and cat recipes.if u email me i will share some.|`|JsCSVzgtaa	Just feed them your leftovers!|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	I've been making my own dog food for about 1 1/2 years now and my dogs love it and are really thriving on it.  I bought the book I first started reading in my vet's office - 'Dr. Pitcairn's Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs and Cats'.  It's got a lot of recipes, all the vitamins and minerals, recipe for Health Powder, and what each vitamins and mineral does.  There's also a large section on health problems.  <br>  <br>  It's a very worthwhile investment if you want to make your own dog food.|`|W0buucLsaa	For what Akitagirl said - humans cannot break down cellulose EITHER. It's called fiber - and dogs need it, too. This is why they eat grass. It's to move everything along.<br>  <br>  To the OP - my vet gave me a recipe during the dog food scare. It's probably not suitable for long-term feeding, but it's a good bridge to the raw diet if you want to do that. I'm not sure that raw meat is any better for dogs than cooked meat (because I have never seen scientific data, from a peer-reviewed study, that proves it). Basically, it's just 1/3 lean meat, cooked, 1/3 vegetable (dark green leafy vegetables are best, but carrots are good too), and 1/3 starch (such as rice or cooked potato or sweet potato). I put a can of tuna in there for the fish oils. <br>  <br>  As for whether it's healthier to give your dog raw meat/cooked meat/people food/etc... I honestly don't know. Most commercial food has tons of byproducts, chemicals, etc. in it. Like the meat you buy at the grocery store - the animals that meat came from were exposed to pesticides, given tons of antibiotics and growth hormones, and were fed horrible diets themselves. (Like cows being fed meat when they are herbivores! That's how Mad Cow Disease started!) Likewise, the vegetables and fruit that you buy at the grocery store have chemicals all over them.<br>  <br>  The fact that the meat was treated so badly makes me wonder if raw is really better than cooked. Does cooking remove some of those nasty byproducts in the meat? I really don't know. <br>  <br>  (And the products that go into kibble are treated the same way, so I'm not disparaging the people food thing.)<br>  <br>  I have no doubt that game in general is better for all animals, including humans, than the crap in the grocery store. Venison, rabbit meat, etc. that's wild caught and not commercially raised - it's going to be better. (Fish may be an exception here, because fish in the wild are exposed to tons of water pollutants.) <br>  <br>  But I have to question the logic that just because it's "natural" (i.e. the diet dogs eat in the wild) makes it healthier or better. That's an unsupported logical leap. <br>  <br>  If our diets were "natural," most of us wouldn't eat strawberries or oranges, because they grow in very few places - and then we'd get no vitamin C, and many humans would die from scurvy.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	Here's how I make my dogs' food:<br>  1. thaw chicken quarter/pork shoulder/heart/turkey wing/beef roast<br>  2. Hand to dog <br>  3. Pick up towel/mat once dog is finished<br>  Dogs weren't made to eat cooked food. Period. They don't need grains, they don't need veggies, they don't need fruit. They are carnivores. they might eat some veggies when prey animals are few and far between but they do not chew and their short digestive tracts cannot effectively break down the cellulose wall of plant cells. This means they get little other than a full feeling from eating them.|`|XCn2dK1laa	I would suggest making a stew of some sort,make sure to include a lot of vegetables.Google what type of meat is best for them.<br>  It's the same with humans,grilling is healthier.You shouldn't give your pet too much grease or too much fat.|`|An2AopAqaa	Dog food recipe site:|`|X1f4icumaa	I love pokemon<br>  and digimon toooo<br>  btw dog food is goooooooooooood<br>  yea
B6zl0AJDaa	Lots of YOUNG horses get these things. I had a AQHA mare who got them back in 1974 when my friend, Flo Largent handed me a small jar with bacon grease and iodine mixture and told me to paint it on my mare.  I thought it was a bit bizzare, but afterall she was in her 50's and I was 21.  <br>  <br>  I went down to where I was boarding, painted it on and a week later, they dropped off.|`|2dJIJr6uaa	Hopefully they are just papilloma which are self limiting - go away themselves.<br>  My friends horse had them them after coming from sales in Ireland - stress of leaving home, sales, on a boat to Scotland into dealers then moving again to my friend's.<br>  We introduced Seaquim seaweed meal into his diet and they dropped off spontaneously. One fell off his sheath and the area looked messy but quickly cleared up, 14 years on they have not returned .<br>  <br>  If your horse is young, it is nothing to worry about and they will disappear as he grows up. (Your vet can send a tiny sample off to Liverpool Uni to have it analysed.)<br>  Many young hrose get warts on muzzles, which do often just disappear. Or you may even be able to get them frozen off.<br>  <br>  Be careful if you squeeze them, you don't want to hurt your horse, if it becomes an open wound it could get infected and also it may leave a scar which you don't want.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I'm glad you just said he is only 2 years old, In that case there is nothing to worry about. Trust me, by the time he is 3 they will all be gone. This is normal in young horses. He will become immune (like us with chicken pots)|`|MK8nvkaxaa	There is no cure for warts that I know of.  Get something in writing from your vet to offer any potential buyer assuring them that this is temporary.  If I remember correctly, once a horse has had a go round with warts, he builds an immunity to them.  Sort of like us with chicken pox.  It ain't pretty, but it isn't anything that will affect him or be contagious to other horses.  It will just take time to let them die off.  I have gone through this as well and it is frustrating.  Good luck!!|`|5kUxkun3aa	alot of youngsters get them. sometimes only one wart.some get clusters. we always leave them and they go. only normally last 1-2 months. if its a good horse why would you not buy it cos of a wart.|`|AA10711527	There is a very simple "cure" for this...  I worked in a huge show barn and we had this problem with a few of our horses.  We called our vet out, and he told us that the warts will cure themselves if you squeeze a couple of them.  We were skeptical, so we tried it on one of the less valuable horses first, and wouldn't u know, all the warts began immediately disappearing within days and no new ones formed.  I guess the warts have some sort of an immunity response that spreads through the bloodstream or something when they are squeezed.  Don't do it to a lot of them though, and also don't do it to any in obvious places because there is a slight chance of scars.  U should be wart-free in a couple of weeks! |`|EQvAbyvcaa	These are usually caused by a harmless virus.  It will resolve on its own and you should not, as your vet said, do anything to them.  They are self-limiting and not a threat in any way.  If these little warts would keep someone from purchasing your colt at a reasonable price, they are idiots and you don't want them to have the horse anyway.  This is nothing and anyone who knows anything at all about horses would know that.  If you interfere with the normal healing of these, you could cause a problem.  Do not do anything that might open the skin and allow bacterial to enter.  Just leave them alone and they will disappear.|`|LYhkoPdhaa	Warts are fairly common in young horses.  I had a two year old that developed them.  My vet told me the same thing...I went to a pharmacy and bought some over the counter wart freezer and applied it to the warts (It comes with a little wand and directions).  The warts fell off within a week and never came back.|`|YRwDQTccaa	Just leave them.  Our yearling had them recently, and the vet said just to leave them - which we did.  His were cleared up in a matter of weeks so hopefully your horses with be also.<br>  I don't think they are contagious as ours were in with another 2 and they were fine.<br>  |`|7fe1ed73bcda2f702554f7f3c4740b55aa	Crush a couple of them with forceps, that's what the vet would/should do.<br>  <br>  This activates an immune response in the horse's body that wipes out the warts. <br>  <br>  Double check with the vet that they are the kinds of warts that would respond to this.|`|Q1U8hP1Xaa	I think he'll be fine...it's not a serious problem,and will go away on its own...I would buy him if he was the right horse for me regardless of the warts. Good Luck! 
p3vjvzRPaa	I know plenty of neutered dogs that do lift their leg (and some were neutered young so hadn't started before then), but I gather neutering can stop the behaviour in some dogs.<br>  <br>  I don't think it always has much to do with dominance.  I know dominant and very submissive dogs that lift their leg<br>  <br>  I also don't think it's a learned behaviour - have never read anything that says that.  My male puppy lives in a house with bitches and has little (if any experience) of seeing other male dogs lift their legs but he lifts his leg and started doing it very young.<br>  <br>  Boxers are late maturers so perhaps he will do it in time.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	Leg hiking is a learned behavior not instinctual. If your male is around other males that lift their legs then he will most likely learn to do the same. My dog is the same age...a German Shepherd and he still pees like a little girl...which is just fine with me! I'd rather have him sqatting and completely emptying his bladder than going and peeing on the tires, the trees, the house, the grill, the garden, the camper, everything he can get his nose on...So if you ask me...peeing like a little girl is a GOOD thing lol!|`|J5hsCONRaa	My guy is just over a year and was "done" at 7 months - to this day, he still does a mixture of squatting and lifting. I guess it depends on the dog really. He is more likely to c**k his leg if there is another male around - other than that he squats a lot.<br>  <br>  We all gave a little cheer when he first lifted his leg (around 6mths) - untill we realised it was up my mums curtains by the back door!<br>  <br>  I know lots of males that have never ****** their leg at all - doesnt make them any less of a male!!|`|RKZHGqh7aa	He pees like that because he feels that he is subordinate. In wolf packs only the alpha male and female lift their legs to mark, all of the other wolves squat. Your dog is acknowledging that you are the alpha.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Some never do...<br>  <br>  My vet told me that if they do not begin to lift a leg to pee before they are neutered, they probably never will.|`|009xnsB1aa	can i see a picture of him.|`|S5Lz35myaa	Some males will never lift their leg - it's just the way they are.|`|uMyMHDPDaa	well my beagle is 2years and almost all the time he pees like a female maybe its do to laziness? thats what i think.|`|TYZMvMrqaa	My dog is 7 and a boy and pees like that
L22hVXTIaa	Take him to the vet to get checked out.|`|ZiC2hGm4aa	Er take him to a vet..|`|An2AopAqaa	If he seems ok then he should be. If he is laying down a lot/not eating/moping around (no pun intended) then he might have inturnal injuries.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Take him to the vet to look for injuries and then buy yourself a leash for your dog.  He wouldn't have gotten hit if he was on a leash.
p3vjvzRPaa	Some other posters are correct, the scar isn't as visible as a human belly button.<br>  <br>  If a dog has an umbilical hernia then where the umbilical cord was can be more visible.  One of my dogs had a small harmless umbilical hernia so she had a belly button.|`|8929fa2803b58abe640d9bd8cb8c209eaa	I don't think they are as visible as human belly buttons. We raise dachshunds and when they are born they all have umbilical cords.|`|knFrwCxcaa	they don't have belly buttons they have little scars|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	yes|`|TYZMvMrqaa	Good question|`|AA10412922	They do but the scar disappears|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Dogs, just like alll mammals have belly buttons, it just isn't as visible as ours.
ceOw99cGaa	Ok so why are you paying for her farrier if she's not your horse? Yes for the most part you are taking care of the horse. If your leasing her the owner should be paying for all bills just to let you know. But yeah you sound like you are pretty much the one that does all the work. Even if you were only grooming her your still taking care of her, because your giving her your time.|`|wCcz31rGaa	usually in a lease, the owner pays for most bills, but it depends what you have pre agreed. <br>  i do think you look after your horse, what more can you do, if you wanted to look after it more, youd have to practically live with it :D<br>  but on a serious note i think your doing fine, the more you doubt yourself, the more the owners will doubt you, juts remember that, they cant expect you to be up there every day anyway, i'm sure you're a busy person, and have other things in your life.|`|3ah2tdgNaa	ur doing good horses are hard to take care of|`|q9PVawNyaa	No. You only do the fun jobs.|`|4fbf9b9ca228754a01b38108c157fb83aa	i would say you do.<br>  
CwNMq7RTaa	Did you ask the vet if the dog could have given you something?  A vet would probably know the answer better than a doctor.  I had a cat that used to get this skin condition that would make his hair fall out and leave the patch of skin underneath looking broken and scabby.  I think what he had was contagious, but it never spread to the other cats because I always treated it.  |`|wNOR4MHtaa	sounds weird maybe ring worm since it is itchy sorry i couldn't help more|`|4aAhEK9daa	LOL - you asked a vet about this and all he said was "uh huh"?  WHAT????<br>  <br>  What you're describing sounds like Ringworm and yes - it's a fungal infection that humans can get as well so you could definitely pass it on to the other kittens.<br>  <br>  I know you like to think you're "rescuing" animals but if you're denying them vet care when they need it you are HARDLY rescuing them.  If you can't afford to get these animals the vet care they desperately need then surrender them to a local no-kill shelter.  And stop taking it animals if it means they're just going to suffer in your care.

4f6e07f358596685acf3778e0fd777dcaa	Well, with such a young horse, I would have to recommend a trainer. He is young, and inexperience, and from what it sounds like, you are inexperienced as well. It is usally a good idea for at least one half of the partnership to be experienced. <br>  <br>  Is your heart set on this horse? It seems to me that you mean very well, but dont have a lot of experience with horses. If that is the case, I would reccomend an older horse...a different one that will be easier (and probably more rewarding. I would hate to see a young mount sour you on the prospect of horse ownership) for you to work with. <br>  <br>  At about eight years old, a horse begins to calm down, and become more "bomb proof". A been there, done that kinda guy, and one I would recomend for a novice owner. These guys are far less inclined to spook and bolt, and in general, just worry less. Its not to say that you dont have to be alert around them, but they are easier than a flighty young one. And a benifit of one that age, is usually, they have most of the training already taken care of and out of the way. On top of that, if you dont have a lot of money, this will save you a bundle on a trainer. Starting a horse from the ground up when you dont really have the experience is extremely difficult, and if you hire a trainer, can get very expensive. (And then you get into wether or not you can spot a scammy trainer or not).<br>  <br>  If you are set on this horse, you are in for a long haul. If he is going to be used a lot (it sounds like he is if you plan on saddle training him), he is going to need more groceries. I know horses who live on pasture and hay, but they are not used on a daily basis. only once in a while. It is cheaper to keep them that way. If you have an experienced friend who is willing to help you train him, get a hold of them! Ask them lost of questions, and depend on them a lot!|`|AA11515691	In my opinion, I would work with it myself. Trainers are very expensive. I have worked with all of my horses myself and they come through great. I would start by riding him bareback anyways. For what you need...obviously the basics of hay, and grain. I would also reccomend having someone you trust and is honest  with experience with horses around just so you have a "mentor". It helps believe me! There is absolutely no hores in the world that is bomb-proof; unless it is blind, deaf and has a broken leg. This is the reason to ride bareback, you know how he moves and what he is going to do. (i.e. he will tense up and you will feel it through your legs)|`|bX1gg7V2aa	I agree with dark_kitten. I know it's difficult when you have your heart set on a horse, but as a first horse owner, you would benefit from getting an older horse, one who is used to all the things that a 3 year old will be unfamiliar with. As dark_kitten said too, this won't mean that an older horse will be perfect or will even be bomb-proof, but a more mature horse will be used to being ridden, and be desensitized to everyday things such as cars, trucks, plastic bags, noise, etc etc that make horses 'spook'  to a much greater extent. All horses spook (at silly things sometimes) but an older horse will not spook at every little thing that he's unsure about. A young horse tends to jump near out of his skin at anything new! If you absolutely have to get this 3 year old, then please don't do anything without a trainer. You could get hurt! Even handling a young horse (ie leading him) could result in an accident if you have no experience, which is another reason to go for an older horse. If you do get an older horse, you should even then seek help from an experienced horse person to give you some safety guidelines, even just for leading your horse. You can never be too careful with horses! As for feeding, then it very much depends on the age, build of the horse and what you are going to be doing with it regarding the horse's exercise. I think you're in the USA, (from the sounds of your post) I'm in the UK and we have different names for feed here, but I'll try  to explain myself: We have something called 'chaff' I think it's called 'chop' there (?) it's basically forage, which is a very important part of a horse's diet. It's recommended that at least half, preferably all, of a horse's diet is made up of forage, so feed chop, plenty of hay. I feed hay ad-lib, and let the horse graze. (Although don't turn your horse out onto a big field full of rich grass!! there are plenty of problems on letting a horse have to much grass and that's a whole separate issue. Look for articles on the net about 'Laminitis' 'founder'. Before you put your horse on any grazing). <br>  I also feed unmolassed sugar beet with the chop twice per day. (get in touch with your feed seller for info on how much to feed) I think you have sugar beet in the states? If you are feeding plenty of hay, the horse is grazing and you feed chop and sugar beet twice a day during the winter (different amounts again in summer, as the grass nutrition content is different) and your horse is having light exercise or no exercise, then this feeding should be adequate.

iMsh4ZhOaa	I've had my warmblood gelding for 7 years and for the first 5 I had him in an american gag (very strong) because I thought that that was the answer, wrong, the problem was that I held him back to much which frustrated him, now when he gets excited I relaxe, give and take with my rains (I used to get so anxious I'd 'fix' my hands, not good) and let him move on a little and this solves the problem, he relaxes and comes back to me, rather than me fighting him which was always a loosing battle!|`|aw6ypXTQaa	Lots of half halts and pulls on the reins before she manages to gain any speed. As long term help, Parelli have a great program that helps horses develop equal brakes to go and is great for safety aspects. I used it with my cob. The process gave instant results and gets rid of all problems with horses. It teaches a horse to shut down when asked and tune into you. Give it a try. Parelli have a website, so take a look because I think that a martingale and new bit will only mask a problem and not cure it and so as the problem festers it could show up in a different more dangerous way. xx|`|PjMtg5unaa	try using a martingale and/or a 3 Ring Dutch Gag if you put it on the bottom ring you have loads of power because the horse knows that it will hurt it if it pulls to much<br>  <br>  I used to have a hyper mare and as was a palomino and i couldn't control her but my dads friend rode her in a 3 ring dutch gag and she slowed down a bit|`|7RYajq63aa	hi im an equine behaviourist and trainer. i have a national driving champ driven in a liverpool. when he came out of driving he was very strong. i used a dually halter (monty roberts) on the ground and a 3 ring snafle to ride. pulling on the reins only make there mouths harder so uses a martingale or albertdavise. if you streach your mucles between hip and knee it will lower the horses head and give you more contact. this is very hard work though. i recomend schooling in a school. as if your training for dressage. works brilliantly. |`|1OkbhfAXaa	use a standing martingale. I had a very strong games pony whom i couldn't control and after a couple of months with this martingale i was able to take it off and he knew i was boss. this is the best martingale for this type of problem|`|LZEjwhlmaa	Walk stop back....over and over, until the lighter pull stops your horse, lighten the mouth,  Sounds basic, but even and old horse can use new tricks.|`|a0ZvQVdcaa	Well i would try a martingale, use more leg or your 'aids' and you can go back to using poles and try again and again!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and you get sorted!<br>  |`|dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	hi Jess ~ well you're got a lovely cob here ~ the problem is that she thinks she's in control, whatever you do, and whatever tackle you use.<br>  <br>  I don't know how often you get to ride, but it sounds like quite a bit, and she obviously loves it.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you go back to basics, try putting up a line of markers across the field, not too far apart, and ride her in and out of each one, sort of zigzag, until she realises that you are controlling her and not the other way round ~ you certainly don't want to break the spirit, but you have to end up in charge, which is why she's pulling away at the moment.<br>  <br>  The other point is, do you ride out with any other horses ~ sometimes when a horse like this is in company with another who is much more docile, it can rub off, and slowly get her to understand what is intended ~ its just a thought ~ but good luck and enjoy!! |`|u2dwOIKuaa	 try using a martingale? :}|`|x4SRTPEoaa	try using a flash? or Mexican grackle bridle?|`|8d25j8CYaa	Going to harsher bits and martingales is only going to make her worse. There is no such thing as a hard mouthed horse. If the horse is properly trained, the snaffle bit should be all you need. The horse needs to be taught to yield to pressure and to flex at the poll.  If you can't easily turn your horse's head, you can't control your horse.<br>  <br>  You can teach her to flex at the poll. This is the first step to gaining control. Stand facing her at her withers. Pull the lead rope back toward her hip and hold it tight. Keep tension on the rope until she puts slack in it by giving to the pressure. If she moves away go with her. As soon as she stops and creates slack, reward her by releasing the pressure. Work with her on both sides until she has this down. Teaching your colt to flex is the foundation you need to teach her other things. Once you teach her this, you will find her giving to the bit.Her neck won't be thick and her mouth won't be hard. You can do this with the bit on and using your rein. You should do this exercise each time before you ride.|`|OUhsp9iAaa	Schooling, schooling and more schooling is the long term solution.  A change of bit or noseband is a short term remedy until the horse gets used to it.  You need to re-establish control in a controlled area and until you can control your horse fully you should not be taking her to a XC event.  A horse is far more likely to get excited amonst other horses and this will just make the problem worse and could end up in a serious accident. <br>  <br>  Use lots of transitions to get your horse listening to you.  Make sure you are giving clear signals using all your aids and not relying just on the reins.  You should be able to steady your horse with your seat and legs with the reins being just a part of the whole aid.  <br>  <br>  Please do not follow Stacy G's suggestion of a standing martingale for XC.  You must NEVER jump in a standing martingale as it restricts the movement of the horses neck which is needed for balance and if they stumble when jumping.  <br>  <br>  This is probably not the answer you want but if you just change tack you could find you are just getting your cob into stronger and stronger tack over time.  |`|dcOJQYRJaa	when a horse begins to behave like this, they are saying that they are in control. what you need to do is go back to the very basics and establish respect. put her in a plain snaffle (or a twisted wire snaffle is she is still too hard to control) and get her in a small area, like a round pen. tack her up as you would normally, with the exception of the snaffle. ride her at the walk, no faster, and work on getting her to bend, give to the bit, and stop easily and lightly when asked. this will take quite a while; at least a week. when she is moving off the bit very lightly with very little control, try it at the trot. do everything you just did at the trot, and remember to praise her when she does the tiniest thing right. do not progress any farther from here until she is stopping on a dime when you tell her to and giving you no resistance to the pressure on her mouth. then you can move on to the canter. once she seems to be doing well with all three, you can move up to a larger area, and eventually to completely open areas. then you can move her back up to the bit you want, but i doubt that you'll need such a harsh bit after you retrain her. but keep in mind that you'll want to go back to the snaffle and quickly do a refresher course with her every now and again. <br>  <br>  and please don't resort to a martingale to "fix" this problem, because it wont. trust me from experience, she'll just become desensitized to it and begin ignoring it like she is doing to the bit now.|`|uzbNZDgkaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You don't say how long you have had her.<br>  She sounds like the sister of my Welsh Mountain cob hahaha<br>  Devils they can be.<br>  <br>  When I first got him I schooled him before hacking out to take some of the energy out of him.<br>  He used to take the bit in his teeth and run so I invested in a drop nose band and a running martingale this did the trick and after a while with alot of patience I changed the bit to an ordinary snaffle. <br>  Whilst riding and you feel her getting her head just give light tugs on her reins so she can feel you and that you are in charge.<br>  <br>  Have patience with her, talking all the time, praise when doing well.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|PEPWFGNGaa	"a three ring snaffle in her atm, with a bar down the middle of the snaffle bit"<br>  I'm familiar with a 3 ring snaffle but can't picture this arrangement - a photo would be somewhat enlightening here....<br>  <br>  For a start I'd suggest getting her teeth looked at - often horses will appear to be "hard mouthed" when they are actually trying to run away from  pain caused by overgrown teeth and harsh bits.<br>  As has already been said practicing lots of stops, turns and backing up would be helpful here but being as she's a cob I think it's probably more a case of hard headed than hard mouthed and you can expect to spend a lot of time in getting her to be more respectful to your requests.<br>  A bit that you might like to consider is this one <br>  <a href="http://www.uksaddlery.com/usrimage/cat58.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.uksaddlery.com/usrimage/cat58...</a><br>  It's a ported Kimblewick and lacks the aggressive nutcracker action of the snaffle as well as having a less poll pressure. It was recommended to me for my big hunter horse who also laughed at the 3 ring - I was pleasantly surprised by the result.|`|uec7RIhbaa	try a pelham bit with roundings.  the roundings reduce some of the power making the bit less harsha dn will mean you only have 1 set of reins to worry about.  if possible try not to use it  all the time as it is quite a severe bit but you don't want to be taking too many risks x country!!!  |`|GUEsVdaFaa	 I had a paint who was 'hard mouthed' whenever I used any kind of bit on him. No matter what I used he'd just act like it wasn't even there and take off on me and stopping him was impossible. So... I switched to a bosal. Believe it or not that thing did wonders! Instead of putting pressure on the mouth, bosals and hackmores put the pressure on the nose, which makes the horse think they can't breathe, this triggers a horses natural self preservation instinct and they give to the pressure. If you don't want to go completely bit-less, try a hackmore attachment that goes with a bit. You can usually find them at your local Orchlens or Tractor Supply or other tack store. |`|AA11570905	I would try using a bit that works differently.  Maybe a slotted Kimberwicke.  It utilizes poll pressure plus a curb chain under the jaw so all of the communication is not on the bars of the mouth or corners of the lips.  Reinsman makes a very nice one with sweet iron mouth:<br>  <a href="http://store.reinsman.com/products/english_cross_over/1082643714" rel="nofollow">http://store.reinsman.com/products/engli...</a>|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	I had a horse that would tank off because he was very keen and found two things worked with him.  A Market Harborough martingale which looks like a running martingale but the divided straps went through the bit and back along the reins and was attached to D rings on the reins.  <br>  <br>  The other was a pelham with 2 reins.  This way he could be ridden on the top rein (like a snaffle rein) when he was calm and reasonably steady, but I could use the bottom rein (curb rein) to back it up when he became too strong.  I do not like the pelham with one rein but D straps because it was too imprecise.  You would need to practice with both before you start on your fun ride so that you know precisely how she will react.<br>  <br>  Also, a good deal of school work for her and you.  Learn to slow your seat down and she will have to follow suit.  Start in walk or trot and establish a rhythm swinging to her walk, rising to her trot.  Then start slowing your swing and your rising and she will have to come back to you.  Do not use the reins except for contact.  This same pony I was talking about earlier could be brought back to almost a canter on the spot using this method, even in company.<br>  <br>  Good luck and patience.|`|Qr14YyFSaa	I found a great bit that does wonders for headstrong horses. I have draft cross and I am pretty tiny so I need all the help I can get. It is called the peewee bit. I am not sure if it is competition legal yet (it is pretty new), but you could check with your local association. Its great, for the first time my horse is willing to give to the bit, and when you don't need it the bit just rests quietly in their mouth (made of sweet iron so it tastes good), but when you do need it you get a lot more power (you only need soft hands unless they get crazy. It will also help soften his mouth because of the sweet iron. I would highly recommend it.
yhSX9RXVaa	I do small local show jumping competitions and i wear a navy show jacket, light cream coloured jods black boots and one of those t-shirts that look like a shirt when you have a jacket on. If you dont own a show jacket wear a dark coloured sweatshirt.Helmets are a must and the have to be of the correct standard and some shows require you to wear a body protector too.<br>  <br>  My horse just wears a black saddle, bridle and martingale and a white saddle cloth. Most small shows are not bothered about what colour saddle cloths, boots ect are. I dont wear boots but you will know yourself if your horse needs them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1O0rp8V5aa	well since your going local you dont really have to have a white saddle pad, you could just have a saddle pad that is a solid color. Your horse should also just wear his regualr tack. For you also since its local you really dont  have to wear a jacket, a white riding shirt, with a  neck collar and or a pen, with your tall boots, and tan riding pants. |`|4KY26xQqaa	Depends really. If you want to be quite formal or just normal.<br>  But I go to alot of local shows. <br>  I normally wear(and so do lots of other people)...<br>  <br>  A plain black jacket<br>  A white shirt<br>  A stock tie<br>  Jods/Breeches<br>  Long boots<br>  <br>  But yes you can wear ankle boots with half chaps but as long as your chaps aren't bright pink with cute horses on them lol!

EENiBG0Saa	well the best thing would be at a park or somewhere such as and the reason why is because u wanna introduce them at a place they can actually get to know each other, if you introduce them at ur house then they will get off at a bad start as your dog will be very very territorial and it will be very very hard for them to make friends....tkae them out together 2-3times a week to a park, let them get to know each other and like each other, once you see they like each other and play with each other then slowly one day from the walk in the park bring them home together straight from the park (after at least 10times of prior gettin to know each other), do not take the female home and bring her later no. the day u finally wanna bring her in (when u see they enjoy each others company) take them to park for a daily walk and bring them home together..this will help alot with territorial issues and they will not fight each other...labs are calm dogs i dont think she will make problems although shepards r very teritorial|`|cnOr4hpWaa	It sounds perfectly reasonable to have them meet in the training where the shepherd meets other dogs, however there definitely could be some dominance issues.  If possible, try getting the scent of both dogs (maybe pet them with a towel) and let the other dog smell it.  <br>  <br>  Whether you do this, or not, or have them at the park/training or your back yard, just make sure they're both on leashes.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|D8W0NPEfaa	That shuld work out but if it doesnt introduce the dogs through a glass window. if they look like they're getting along let them through the door to sniff each other and say hi, but keep them on a tight leed incase they're not as friendly towards eachother as u hoped. if they dont get along while they're looking through the glass door take them away from eachother and try again later.|`|9f29evNzaa	I think dog training is a good idea, but also dog parks can be a great place to go for introducing your dog to other dogs.|`|HZtcmRr9aa	Find a dog park. You will finds lots of dogs and people who know and love dogs.|`|CsLVMnpYaa	go to the park.. throw a ball and run the other way..if the dog catches up, he is yours and yours forever!|`|AA11090351	Meet at the public park.|`|wNOR4MHtaa	it is worth a try maybe he wont be that dominating if you explain he is not staying forever just for a little while|`|7ElYvq98aa	probabyl....if not try a park that caters to dogs!|`|7iEk06aDaa	When I plan on introducing my dog, a dominate female pitbull, to other dogs, I do it on a walk. The owner of the other dog and I with my dog go on a nice long walk together to give the dogs a sense of 'pack' and it usually works out pretty good. |`|DcUoZntOaa	tough one, i would just put them together at the first opportunity!<br>  peace!|`|lmSffrNuaa	One of the thorniest issues a pet owner may face is introducing another dog or puppy into the family. A dog who has had the house and family to himself may not welcome another dog in his "den," and may resent having to share his family's attention. The initial meeting is important, so you'll need to prepare to improve your chances of success.<br>  <br>  These links provide some steps on how to introduce your dog to another dog.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/bringing-home-a-second-dog-aspca.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/bringing-home-a-secon...</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/new-dog-old-dog-training-center.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/new-dog-old-dog-train...</a>|`|tB7QK6BTaa	I introduce dogs with an extended on leash walk, this promotes the sense of Pack, which is what you want, Pack is family to a dog.  Usually I'll go with my dogs to the place the new comer is coming from, and Pack walk for an hour, then come home and before going into the established dogs home, go for another hour long Pack walk . <br>  <br>  <br>  The worst place to introduce them is in the older dogs home.|`|5054519500dcad040d4a81c2230cabe0aa	if you have a nice back yard i would do it in a backyard but if not in a park|`|09c8f2aa42f6255f80371d12edbfa7f6aa	This would be a fine place to introduce them.  I suggest you meet with this other dog a number of times and let the dogs interact for periods of time before brining this other dog home.<br>  What I've done with dealing with similar situations is have my dogs meet the other dogs and interact several times, then when the time comes for the dog to come to my place I take my dogs for a walk, meet up with the new dog on the walk, then we all walk home together.  This seems to minimize conflict over another dog entering their territory.  <br>  You may also want to try doing the above and bringing the other dog home for a visit or two prior to it being dropped of.<br>  <br>  I'd also be very wary of leaving the dogs alone together.  I've done quite a bit of animal rescue as well as animal sitting for friends and neighbors and things can get unpredictable and scary really fast.  Hopefully this won't happen with your dogs, but have a plan B in place just in case you need it.  Oh, and one thing I've learned really well...is to pick up all toys, bones and anything that my dogs are possesive of prior to bringing the new dog into their territory.  Another dog going near their favorite object is a sure way to get a fight going.<br>  <br>  Best wishes and good luck.
NbcrR9xnaa	?a commence mal si tu ne supportes déjà plus de nettoyer les cacas de ton chaton... C'est un bébé comme un autre, tous les bébés demandent un peu plus d'attention, de soins, de patience, que les adultes.<br>  Un chaton de cet age doit à peine être sevré et pas encore habitué à la nouvelle nourriture, ce qui lui provoque des dérangements intestinaux.<br>  Au fait, il ne va pas dans son sable à chat ?

EhtIZxcsaa	The best thing to do is to take training classes with the pup.  It will help the pup to bond with you.  <br>  <br>  He is a baby and of course he is going to be distracted by what is going on while you are out walking. I'm guessing if he doesn't listen to you while walking he doesn't listen to you in the house either. The aggressiveness will get worse if you don't get it under control now....<br>  <br>  You need to start training him or he is going to be a little monster by the time he is 2 yrs old.|`|0QQXGtntaa	He is the prefect age for a puppy obedience class.  Ask around, find a good trainer, who will not only teach him commands but also give you a plan for success. <br>  <br>  Positive reinforcement works tons better that punishment, especially with the youngsters.|`|GsXEB26caa	When the dog barks make him lay down on his back. This is a submissive possition. He will settle down very quickly. Do this consistently when you see him barking and in a week you will have a new dog. Almost all dogs are trainable , if you are having trouble with him just understand , it is your fault as the pack leader that things are not right. You are the one that must learn how to handle him. You must be his pack leader.|`|LdQOASIzaa	keep ur puppy always full|`|ml61Uvv9aa	The leash thing will take time. Be patient. The dog is just 6 months old. He is very curious. The barking thing is a pain I am sure. I have a 3 year old pit bull that never barked. She would try, but nothing would come out. Now that I moved into a new place I noticed that she is getting out a few barks. After three years she finally has a voice. I think I figured out why she is barking now. My new place has a ton of windows and a glass front door. Now she can see everything that is going on outside of my house. When she sees people or other dogs, she tries to bark. Maybe not allowing your dog as much stimulation will cut down on his barking. I don't know. I bought shades for my windows and a new front door and the barking has stopped. Just a suggestion. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  PS:  My dog took a long time to get the potty training concept. Just be patient.|`|qv5bHnecaa	squirt him with water and tell him to hush.

m6njo2Zlaa	Try getting her an additional litter box and put it in a different part of the house.  <br>  <br>  And you shouldn't be cleaning out a litter box without latex gloves on if you are pregnant! A mask is part of what you need but you can't absorb that stuff into your skin! Be careful|`|DiIzQx6Paa	BECAUSE IT DONT LIKE THE LITTER MY CAT DID THAT 2 IF IT IS A GIRL CAT SOMTHING IS WRONG LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING CHANGES AND SHE FEELS WIERD ALMOST SCARED ABOUT THEM SHE FEELS UNCOMPFORTABLE AROUND THEM MY CATS DID THAT 2|`|OBHkUN1Zaa	You know what I think it's part from the changes going around in your house and the other part is.....Does your cat see you clean it's litterbox? Because if it does it could be that it's frightened by your gloves and mask that you wear for protection because it's probably not use to seeing you cleaning it's litterbox with a scary mask and gloves.  Also, cat's are kind of weird with smells and maybe it doesn't like the smell of Latex because you are touching the litterbox with your gloves and maybe that sends up a boundery the cat doesn't want to touch.  Or you could try buying a new litterbox and start from scratch. I hope this gives you some ideas!|`|QYEprKXZaa	It could be the type of littler. my cat did the same thing. I went through 5 differ brands before he would get in it. Maybe your cat is really clean and wont go into it unless there is nothing in it?? i have heard that before too. Or maybe your little box is to small for her?|`|b3RhJGYZaa	This might be a behavioral problem or a health issue. I would make a vet visit.|`|sEXKE3GRaa	change can be a problem.<br>  my cat didn't like it when we switched the litter.<br>  also, she can be a brat and some times likes to get back at us by pooping on the floor when she doesn't get what she wants. <br>  Occassionally I would stand in the doorway when she headed to the bathroom and she knew she would get in trouble for going on the floor. She only does it now when the litter is new.|`|w6TXFvkraa	if u let the litter get too full then the cat wont use it...even if it dosnt look that bad they like clean litter
lFbin74Daa	They don't stay piglets very long. Thier nose is a serious rototiller, rough to the touch, so strong a pig can uproot concrete if he/she finds a crack to start digging. They act like bulls and want thier way all the time. If you buy more than one piglet they will act in a pack order. They are solid and tough with wire type hairs on thier body. They will eat anything, roadkill, anything that crawls, bugs, grubs, worms, chocolates, slop, charcoal, dead or alive anything and everything to be quite frank.<br>   Very strong animals, like a mini bull with the attitude to boot.<br>   If this is your first pig, I would suggest a Pot Belly or Miniture ... if you go with a Hamshire piglet, you need to know what your doing. <br>   Never let a pig get hungry, it will maul and kill you.<br>   If not a mini or Pot Belly, they can get upwards of 500 plus pounds of solid braun.<br>   Good luck.|`|AQIF3qIbaa	The best pet pigs to get are the little pot-bellied pigs. They stay fairly small, and are pretty smart, too.  <br>  <br>  There aren't any specific places where you could board your pig, but I have heard many stories of people being able to potty-train their pot bellied pigs and keeping them in the house, like dogs.  I have never done it myself, so you will need to really do research on how it is done with pigs, but it is supposed to be pretty easy.<br>  <br>  You can buy feed for pigs at the same place that you get feed for other livestock.  They also can eat just about anything that we do.  They like veggies, breads, meat, name it, they eat it.  But it would be best to feed them a regular pig feed to make sure that they get enough nutrition, and feed them snacks on the side.|`|79rU8dlzaa	pigs are very smart animals but they can grow quite large so not a apt pet,better off on a small farm they will eat a variety of things organic but always give them a proper hog mash to get proper vitamins,as for boarding if you have the money anything can be boarded,they are like any pet they love attention and will get into trouble when bored, again they need room not recommended if you do not have the space for them
O7yILHg8aa	I think most cats do this.  They'll be sitting on the couch looking around at things then they start closing their eyes, a few minutes later they go off and find somewhere comfy to sleep.  At least both my cats do this.<br>  I think cats are just naturally lazy and catch a few seconds of zzzzz's whenever or wherever, they arent picky.|`|0d685c017cf7a74366a71e0aefe1307eaa	My cat Jasper falls asleep in some of the funniest positions.

AA11548502	i use cream cheese. or something similar- you want something that is smooshy so it is easy to cover the pill, and there will be not taste of the pill; your dog will eat it without even knowing.|`|XKNQkwuGaa	hi i have tried to add u to my contacts but i'm having trouble with the system. just put the pill on her tongue right at the back of her throat, then hold her jaws until she swallows it. sometimes as i hold the snout i blow in their nose until the meds are swallowed. my husky has to take pills for allergies so this is the way i get him to take them. you can wrap the pill in a piece of meat or cheese but my big guy eats the treat then i find the pill on the floor. not all big dogs will have problems with their joints just becarefull since she has shown some signs with her neck. i also give my dogs salmon oil capsules for their coats, it helps with their skin too. by the way my vet has told me about the asa and the fish oil pills just in case you are questioned about it. ask you own vet to see if he agrees. best of luck.|`|AN0SpF6maa	You're giving your dog aspirin? Presumably it's something which has been prescribed by your vet otherwise you definitely shouldn't be giving it to her and your vet should have showed you how to give her the medication. As she's a big dog, the best way is probably to buy a pill plunger which you should be able to buy from your vets.
3uIOlUo7aa	She doesn't know or she wouldn't do it in other places.  Dogs don't do stuff for spite or to get attention like that -- that is a human trait and not a canine one.  You haven't properly trained her and/or she might be too young to be capable of being considered fully house trained.  Keep working with her by reinforcing when she is urinating in the right place and discouraging other places -- it is best to try to anticipate her and make sure she is in the right place when she is due to urinate so that you can positively reinforce her proper behavior.  Dogs learn through repetition and just because they do it a few times doesn't mean they are well trained.<br>  <br>  <br>  add:  Puppies don't 'claim territory' with voiding -- they pee because they need to go.   Mature dogs don't even 'claim territory' by simple voiding - they do it by marking which is a totally different behavior than simply voiding.|`|rz2KRd20aa	I think you are all being silly.... I just think the poor baby's gotta go. Take her out out every 2 hours or so. She's prob a little nervous in her new environment, i know my puppy was when we brought her home. All puppies know how to do is sleep eat and pee/poo. Just help her out a little, give her some guidance and love. And for peats sake, get off the computer... stop reading this message... and go play with her!|`|3283b95426f17cf4624ae9783067b919aa	She is claiming her territory. Take it back let her know its yours. When she pisses in the wrong area tell her know in a very loud voice and carry her to the correct pissing juncture.|`|8e1fac743a035fe00bdb106ec6272e4aaa	i think you need to give her more attention and watch her a few more times when she goes wee wee. lol|`|AA11937729	How old is your puppy?<br>  <br>  It could be you're not paying her hardly any attention - your puppy needs guidance and needs to be taken out every two hours..................<br>  <br>  ................of course your puppy will pee everywhere if the previous pee had not be cleaned up properly.<br>  <br>  So, your question is actually incorrect - your puppy DOES NOT know where to urinate - you need to go back to the basics and start all over again.

Un autre adorait les olives avec lesquelles il jouait avant de les manger. Ce qu'ils n'aimaient pas c'était qu'on les prennent dans les bras plus de 10 secondes et les portes fermées. Celui-ci (7 mois), adore aussi les caresses aux pattes et sur le ventre. Il mange un bout de tartine à la compote, à la confiture, au fromage, à la charcuterie (ce qui est plus logique). Il est aussi jaloux  des hommes qui rentre à la maison (copain, famille). Il est affectueux, propre et pas rancunier.

Elle a aussi une passion pour les petits pois, qu'il faut lui écraser car elle a du mal à les attraper, et adore finir les yaourts nature, que j'aromatise pourtant avec un peu de confiture.

DtsGq5Zdaa	1  Introduzione <br>  <br>  Anteprima della sezione<br>  Balenottera azzurra Nome comune del mammifero marino classificato Balaenoptera musculus nell’ordine dei cetacei misticeti, considerato la più grande creatura esistente sulla Terra. La femmina, infatti, mediamente poco più grande del maschio, può raggiungere una lunghezza di 30 m e un peso di 150 tonnellate. Un tempo diffusa in tutti gli oceani del mondo, oggi è piuttosto rara ed è considerata specie a rischio d’estinzione. La balenottera azzurra compie lunghe migrazioni, spostandosi dalle regioni tropicali o limitrofe, dove passa l’inverno, fino ai margini delle banchise polari di entrambi gli emisferi, dove trascorre l’estate. <br>  <br>  2  Caratteristiche fisiche e riproduzione <br>  <br>  Anteprima della sezione<br>  La balenottera azzurra presenta un colore grigio chiaro screziato di bianco; il suo nome si deve all’effetto per cui, nelle giornate di sole, appare azzurra a chi la osservi mentre nuota subito sotto la superficie. La screziatura è caratteristica di ogni animale e viene utilizzata dai ricercatori per identificare i singoli individui e raccogliere informazioni sui loro movimenti. La pinna dorsale è relativamente piccola, localizzata in posizione arretrata. La balenottera azzurra, dopo una gestazione di 11 mesi, in primavera dà alla luce solitamente un solo piccolo per volta; occasionalmente, si verificano nascite gemellari. Il balenotto appena nato misura circa 7 m; si nutre del latte materno per 7-8 mesi e cresce al ritmo di 90 kg al giorno. <br>  <br>  3  Comportamento <br>  <br>  Anteprima della sezione<br>  La balenottera si nutre di invertebrati marini (ad esempio piccoli crostacei) e pesci, filtrando l’acqua di mare attraverso i fanoni: quando l’acqua colma di cibo fluisce nella cavità boccale, una sessantina di pieghe della gola si espandono a fisarmonica, in modo che la sacca golare formi un’enorme borsa; quindi la balena chiude la bocca, lasciando un’apertura di circa 50 cm e spingendo fuori l’acqua attraverso 270-390 paia di fanoni neri, piatti e lucenti, che pendono dal palato. Il cibo, trattenuto sulla superficie interna dei fanoni, viene inghiottito solo quando l’acqua è stata espulsa. <br>  <br>  Le balenottere azzurre spesso cacciano in coppia, servendosi l’una dell’altra per impedire la fuga alle prede. Come molti altri cetacei, emettono intensi suoni a bassa frequenza, udibili nelle profondità oceaniche anche a distanze superiori ai 160 km. è probabile che questi richiami abbiano un ruolo importante per la comunicazione intraspecifica (tra membri della stessa specie). <br>  <br>  4  Una specie protetta <br>  <br>  Anteprima della sezione<br>  Nel periodo compreso fra gli anni Trenta e Sessanta del XX secolo la balenottera azzurra fu sottoposta a una caccia spietata, arrivando fin quasi all’estinzione. Oggi, considerata specie protetta, è in lenta ripresa e sta tornando a popolare diverse zone del suo areale originario. Dal 1985, ad esempio, al termine dell’estate è possibile avvistare gruppi di balenottere azzurre a caccia di cibo nella baia californiana di Monterey.<br>  <br>  Classificazione scientifica: La balenottera azzurra viene classificata Balaenoptera musculus nella famiglia dei balenotteridi, sottordine dei misticeti, ordine cetacei, classe mammiferi, phylum cordati.<br>  <br>  foto:<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/BlueWhaleSkeleton.jpg/300px-BlueWhaleSkeleton.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.it/imgres?imgurl=http://www.deiva.net/csr_bpmusodx1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.deiva.net/balenottera.htm&h=200&w=300&sz=30&hl=it&start=12&tbnid=-w6v7ktAXEhC6M:&tbnh=77&tbnw=116&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dbalenottera%2Bazzurra%26gbv%3D2%26hl%3Dit%26sa%3DX" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.it/imgres?imgurl=ht...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Cetacea.jpg/250px-Cetacea.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.asetra.it/uploads/balenottera6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.asetra.it/uploads/balenottera...</a><br>  <br>  sono immagini e siti dove puoi trovare altre informazioni..<br>  <br>  ciao ciao ( miglior risposta??)|`|6ZmxHualaa	penso sia lo squalo balena o comunque qualche altra specie di balena, gli animali terrestri sono più piccoli.<br>  :-)|`|DvY2IW1Haa	IL MIO.|`|RYZzKbQGaa	La balenottera azzurra, se non ricordo male...|`|Y0yYXna6aa	i dinosauri ma siccome si sono estinti penso qualche balena,lo squalo bianco.....|`|qQ0UJQbqaa	la balenottera azzurra e a seguire l'elefante africano|`|sJEp4bMmaa	la balena, una volta avevo letto da qlk parte che l'animale piu grande è un tipo di balena  ma nn mi ricordo il nome e x fare capire la grandezza hanno detto che un elefante  aconfronto è un moscerino .. aiuto......|`|10aad539b8a8618c145a30db7b10b19caa	boooh... credo la balena.
be4713a62cd09ef02dd3b4b06dd1c9f1aa	Place your hands together on the pomel of the saddle while posting. Don't lift them off the saddle, or let them move forward or backwards. This will make your elbows unlock, and teach your hands be quiet. Keep doing this untli you get use to allowing your hands to remain in the same place.|`|Oiabe82gaa	I would try 2 things. Firstly I would try posting without stirrups. Secondly I would try posting without reins, then try without both.<br>  Also, while you're are on the Lunge line, you could try posting with stirrups and a glass of water in each hand. Not real glasses, but plastic glasses. Make sure they have a stem like plastic Champagne glasses, this way you can keep your hands in the correct position with thumbs on top. This used to be great for me to learn, but is WAY harder than it sounds!!Good Luck!!!|`|N0BHmJWvaa	You are using your lower leg to post and it is throwing off your whole body.  Take the stirrups off your saddle and reteach yourself to post while keeping proper form.  This is good practice for any rider at any level because it can help you "reset" a lot of bad habits and strengthens your leg muscles.  Two-point without stirrups for three laps...feel the burn!|`|RAzzOqaDaa	its like the race horses a little bit with the arms. they have to move with the neck while you move with the body. once you post a horse for awhile you settle into their rythm. i suggest you try just posting for no reason and make your hands keep a little contact with his/her neck. its a bit low but might help you get the coordination right. mainly just ride as much as you can. time always works. good luck!|`|dz9K4K2Raa	Try posting with only a lunge line.  you can keep your hands on your legs, but try hard to relax them.  Or you can simply keep your arms down to your sides when you post.  If you know anyone who can teach you yoga on horseback try that.  It can help correct a number of riding problems.|`|1f00a5e7509f1d66ad672d6d80f59af3aa	You need lots of time on the lunge line with no reins nor stirrups to better develop your seat and the independence of your aids, i.e., hands, seat, legs and back.<br>  <br>  PS- they are ALL related.
1gj1M3xHaa	When you ride him bring him into a canter and very lightly pull back on the reins, as he slows down, make sure you keep him from slowing into a trot, but his canter should become slower and slower. when he gets to the speed you want release the pressure, if he starts to speed back up, pull back again, but don't pull back to hard or he'll think you wan't him to stop. <br>  <br>   We did this with one horse and after about an hour of riding in the round pen each day for a week he had a canter that felt like you were in a rocking chair. <br>  If he starts to speed up in the arena just pull back lightly on the reins and he will go into his slow canter that you have taught him.<br>  <br>  He may just get excited in the arena, a bit nervous, or maybe its the polo training. Best of luck in your show.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Can you arrive early and use the show arena for practice in advance?  My experience is that no matter how impeccable my horse would perform at home, the excitement of being at a show could throw it all out the window.<br>  So, is his canter perfect at home?  If it isn't, then he isn't ready to show.  Do you mimic the length of time he spends cantering at a show when you work him at home?  It doesn't sound like you need help with technique so much as figuring out why he does this at shows?|`|oHL8qA42aa	your horse relaxes when you relax. i have the same problem. at home my horse couldnt be steadier and i have to ask him foward. at shows he is uncontrollable. try to relax and he will respond. what type of riding is it anyway because  in jumpers speed is good. good luck. remember count your rythm.|`|yqKTPVwqaa	Horses will naturally be stronger and more forward at horse shows than they are at home.  My best advice is to make sure you aren't nervous and clenching on your horse.  Next, you may just want to spend time bringing your horse to show grounds (but not actually competing) and just walk him around and help him remember that he isn't a polo horse anymore.  In the ring, don't let him slice and lean on the corners.  Pushing him around your leg and making him balance and focus should also help him to slow down.  You can work the bit and use half halts to help him put his head down.  Martingales generally aren't allowed in flat classes, but some schooling shows will let you use them.  Definitely use one for jumping classes and when you're acclimating him to horse shows.  Good luck.|`|AnX8QHgHaa	It sounds like he needs more prep.  What do you do with him in the morning before you show? I would try hacking him in the am.  Nothing fancy, just a short warm-up and then canter for 10-20 mins depending on how up he is.<br>  <br>  On the first day of a show my horse always needed to lunge, hack and then lunge again (15 mins on the lunge to get the bucks out, hack for 20 mins mostly cantering, and then another 10-15 on the lunge to make sure he got all the silliness out)|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Here is what I do with my OTTB lesson horse:<br>  Sit deep in the saddle<br>  Give Half-Halts<br>  Say easy in a calm voice.<br>  That always keeps her in frame and slower.|`|AA12005037	Sit deeper in the saddle(heavier) and grip with your thighs, not your calves.<br>  The other thing you need to think about is if you are nervous. If you're nervous, your horse will be nervous. Take a couple deep breathes and relax. It could be his nerves too, either way, walking around the show arena(if possible) or around the showgrounds at least, will help you calm down. Try not to pull back in the show arena- it makes the judge say icky. Walk around(on your horse) a LOT before the class. Smiling helps to relax too, remember that the calmer you are the calmer your horse will be(which is why my horses always go too slowly... another problem :D)|`|yF974SFUaa	Work on bringing his hindquarters under him and balancing him. Lots of indirect outside rein and steadying inside leg at the girth with outside leg just behind the girth. Sit deep and push him along. Make sure he's coming into the bridle.<br>  When you get to the corners, picture him as a ball, bending around your inside leg. Keep tension on your inside rein, shifting to more of an indirect rein. This will help keep him from dropping that inside shoulder.<br>  Also, longe him before your classes.<br>  Good luck!|`|c21d0003bc4cc7e4b99196c5d509dbd7aa	Since your horse is fine at home, but different at the show, I'm guessing that the problem is that you are tensing up at the show.  Don't worry - almost everyone has this problem in the beginning.  At home, you are completely relaxed because you are under no pressure.  It's just you and the horse.  At a show, there's no doubt about it you can feel all those eyes on you and you're bound to get nervous.  You can even be nervous without realizing it.  Your heart rate goes up and you clench with your legs subconciously.  Consequently, if you are nervous, your horse will be nervous.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can try to do at your next show is relax. Get there early so you don't have to stress about being in the ring on time.  You could even longe your horse before you saddle up to get his attention focused on you.  Before you get on, do a few stretches to relax your muscles. Once you're in the saddle, think about RELAXING at all times.  Loosen your all your muscles and continue to breathe deeply. You should notice a difference in the ring if you are relaxing correctly.  Remember to sit deep in your saddle when you ask him to canter, look where you're going (not down), and keep your hands low.  This will help your horse relax and fall into that nice canter you're used to back at home.  If he speeds up, do not clench with your legs.  Just breathe and sit deeper in the saddle, and give him a few half halts.  <br>  <br>  All of these techniques should help, no matter what the exact problem may be.  Just remember to keep your horse's attention and relax the best you can.  And just have fun! <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aVOIfX2eaa	I have a problem similar to yours. I have an 8 year old off the track thoroughbred, who wants to run run run. He's fine at the w/t/c, but when we start jumping he gets excited and races around, sticking his nose out and pulling me. Instead of falling forward and losing my reins, (and confidence), I sit back and deep in the saddle, especially around the turns, and try to collect him first by pulling back but keeping my leg on him so he stays at the gait. If he doesn't respond, I play with the bit, doing small half halts until he relaxes a little more. For the first week of doing this, he stuck his nose up higher, but after awhile he got what  I was saying and slowly lowered his head. When or if he does it at the trot, post slower and take your leg off of him. Just like the canter, relax your body and do small half halts until he finally drops his head and responds. Hope this helped!|`|xHQSmEiqaa	Seems like his polo brain is kicking in at the show arena! At twenty eight he is like any man, fixed in his ways. Your instructor should be good enough to teach you how to work around the problem or you need a new instructor!<br>  Try a lightly adjusted martingale to keep his head down and a dropped noseband to keep his nose into his neck but I stress not too tight or he will try to fight these items! Good luck and I hope you win.|`|ez4kd2lSaa	try sitting deeper into the saddle and collecting him. i use to have the same proplem with my big tb! this also could be becuse polo horses are trained to go slow and home and fast when ther out try maybe lunging at the comp!!!<br>  <br>  :):)gabs|`|xPTudZ2Laa	tell him whoa or pull very slightly on the reins just enough to make him slow down. also maybe a half halt may help!!!|`|fed3f96fb7a6a227ffe54a397f5b8710aa	tell him "whoa canter" I ride saddleseat so that's what I do. Or pull slightly back and say "easy".
Cfk1kr8Daa	Good question - and good for you for asking.<br>  <br>   Annie can come out and visit for a little while, provided she is being an attentive mother and goes back - but avoid giving her any treats or special attention - no company until the puppies are weaned, unless she is either secluded or is willing to be present when people visit her puppies.<br>  <br>    The puppies should have NO visitors but you in the room until they are at least tow weeks old, three is better (just a peek is OK, and no shoes go into the puppy nursery.<br>  <br>    You should be able to gauge by Annie's behaviour as to whether she can go socialize - but for the next couple of weeks, only a quick hello on the way by to the yard, and then back in the ivory tower goes she - for meals and everything.<br>  <br>    MAKE SURE ANNIE IS FENCED IN OR LEASHED WHEN SHE GOES OUT!  I lmost learned this tohe hard way one day - I figured no momma dog would do anything but go out pee, and come back - until I heard the screech of car tires!  She had darted across the road to see a passing dog and his owners, and almost ended up being a hood ornament.<br>  <br>    She should have a full  bowl of puppy food now, since she's feeding the family, and a full bowl of fresh water, on the opposite side of the room.<br>  <br>    Watch her nipples that they don't get hot, red, or swollen - if any looks at all questionable, put your biggest, fattest puppy on it to drain it, until it loks better - and if there is any that looks really bad, place a warm compress on it twice a day. Watch her like a hawk - check twice a day - so you don't end up having to feed them yourself.<br>  <br>    Pick up every puppy at least once a day, and handle each of their paws gentle between your fingers, one at a time.  They need that mental stimulation, even though their eyes are still closed.  They will get your scent, and learn about humans that way, too.<br>  <br>    Clip their little nails every day so they don;t gouge Annie up - you can get a little flip and fold nail clipper at the drugstore in the infant secction - just take off the little white tip, but you find they grow very quickly - everything does on a puppy!<br>  <br>    You should be planning worming schedules and first shots, and eye exams now - you will need wormer for everyone, so buy a big bottle.<br>  <br>    And where are our pictures - HUH?!<br>    I'll bet their cute - but we want proof!<br>  <br>    Pats to Annie - but not too many!|`|Bw18seFqaa	I would say thats up to Annie..  let her determine when she's comfortable having her pups around the other dogs.  Maybe in a week or two, put a baby gate up and let the other dogs see and smell from there, and watch Annie's reaction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe Im mistunderstanding too..  are you wanting the pups to socialize with other dogs in the household?  Or are you talking about taking Annie out other places?<br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldnt take Annie places while she has pups..  too much risk of her picking up a disease and taking it home to her pups..  even if she is immune to things like parvo.. if she is exposed to it, she can bring the virus home on her coat or feet.|`|vCVvXsZVaa	Annie will know! As long as she returns to care for them there should be no reason for you to worry.<br>  <br>  The pups are beautiful. You & Annie did a great job!|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Wow!  7 pups!  <br>  <br>  Annie will not want to leave her pups this soon.  she can be taken out to do her duty but that should be about it.  Please remember she needs to be with her pups to keep them warm and feed the often so her main deal right now is to take care of her pups and not to socialize with your other dogs. <br>  Also this kind of thing I didnt allow until the pups Were almost of the age to be going to their new homes. Even thought your other dogs can be completey nice and clean you just never know what they can give to Annie and then she to her pups!<br>  <br>  As far as letting the other dogs have a look at the new arrivals This is something I didnt allow at all.  To risky and Annie will not appreciate intruders around her pups!  Plus there is the health risk too.<br>  <br>  ADD:  Aww they are beautiful hon!|`|trVQ3Ld1aa	She can start socializing with the dogs in your home as soon as she wants to. Wait until she is ready. Each ****** is different. She may not want to leave her puppies for more than potty breaks for two weeks, or she may be ready for short breaks after the first several days. <br>  Since you can't be sure what level of immunity the puppies have... Don't take Annie on walks off your property. As a matter of fact... I wouldn't be willing to risk taking any of the dogs anywhere where they may be exposed to something to bring home to the puppies.|`|ZuxmbhQ6aa	She will decide when she feels it is safe enough to leave them, but always make sure that she can get back to them easily and quickly, do NOT force her come out. I am sure you are aware that she may get aggressive with the other dogs if she feels they are in any way a threat to her or the uppies. You must keep an eye on their behaviour as well as Annie and the puppies.<br>  <br>  Really cute puppies. Is the puppy on the light blue towel the same as the one on the pink background? The pink looks blue merle, but the one on blue looks as if it could be slate merle, that is why i was wondering if they were different uppies or if it was just thhe lighting making the puppy look lighter.|`|2z69twcpaa	i agree with nekkid, it depends on when Annie feels comfortable leaving her pups for a short time and how she reacts to the other dogs, it really has to be on her terms, she will see herself as alpha dog while she has puppies so if Annie is a sweetie with other dogs put a baby gate up and see how she reacts, if she is OK then slowly let your calmest dog have contact with her and her puppies, but it will all depend on how relaxed Annie feels, after about a week and a half she may feel ready for a 10 min max walk but if she is a really good mum she may not feel comfortable going for a walk until her babies are 3-4 weeks old, at the moment the pups are too young, but as they get older she may enjoy a small break, just set a heat lamp up to keep the puppies warm while she is gone, best of luck with the puppies honey.|`|nuXTweA4aa	Put the bitc-h OUTSIDE to eliminate & immediately return!!!!! To it's WHELPING PEN...NOT an entire room!!!!<br>  Use a BUCKET for water,fastened high enough to avoid DROWNING the whelps.<br>  <br>  Do ***NOT**** drag it around to freaking "socialize"!!!!<br>  <br>  Bitches need to be w/the litter 23 hrs.a day for WEEKS!!!! 3 is MINIMUM!<br>  At around 7-8 wks.it may be kept away during the day.<br>  <br>  NO "visitors" of ANY species!!!! Ever heard of viruses? Bacteria? Parasites?|`|eLbJennXaa	as long as all are vacinated and none of your other dogs are curently sick she can if she wants to, you'll just have to test her, she migth have different behaviour and prioritises now that she have small puppys<br>  <br>  it migth be she is fine with it, or it migth be it will stress her, if so then you shouldnt forse her upon the other dogs both for her own sake and theirs<br>  <br>  generaly she will know best herself when she comfortably is ready to be back with the pack|`|LZ8QdXXFaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I think annie can go as soon as she is ready as long as she isnt abandoning the pups and can come back to them when she wants. hopes this helps.x|`|CzW1KSnpaa	I think about 3 months|`|QVP8zSuWaa	LOL at some of the answers. Annie could leave her puppies for a few minutes to stretch her legs and go pee after the first day. She will know when they are happy and content enough to give her a break. Congratulations I wanna see pictures.<br>  <br>  They are sooo cute. A couple of them look like Aussies. Annie is such a beautiful girl, She looks like my very first dog that I got at the age of 6. Can we get daily updates??|`|qybtMl3Jaa	She will move about in her own time, animals know what to do and how to do it instinctively. <br>  By the way you are a very nice person!<br>  Good Luck!

JL6GXFJOaa	 The right horse will come along and you'll know it. Get a horse that is going to take you far. Dont' get a western horse if you wanna do eventing. Get a horse who is multi-diciplined and is going to take you far. You will probably grow a little more, so get a horse that is going to be for your height. Most importantly when you go to look at the horse, feed him a treat, pick up his hooves, mess around with his face, grab his tail, tack him up, lead him, do everythign you will do. Sometimes people just don't do this adn get a horse who is head shy or something. I promise that you'll know and everythign will work out. I recently lost my gorgous mare adn wasn't going to look for horses so soon (she passed away this week). I decided to look online just to see what is out there. I found a mare right by my house who has an amazing show record. I feel like my mare who I lost just wanted me to look at this horse. I promise that you'll know hwne it is the right one. |`|RB0Zlpycaa	if you want good grades and a good horse, it really is hard to find time for social school activities. you just have to choose what is most important to you. |`|mcrlWjZNaa	wow. high expectations. good for u though. u finnally convinced them. i would set asided a 1/2 hor or hour to revue what u did that day and get help on what u didn't understand. but the rest of the time i would spent at the barn. hope i helped =)|`|4fbf9b9ca228754a01b38108c157fb83aa	like what do you mean?|`|ceOw99cGaa	Ok there are a few things you do have to consider before buying a horse. PEOPLE LIE! not every one but some talk their horses up so much and they turn out to be nothing like you expected. They told me my horse was trained he was all tacked up when i came out. Well come to find out he just got gelded, he behaved because he was by his mares. Well needless to say i bought him and I trained him and still have him till this day.Now one thing alot of people don't realize that is your still rather young. By this I mean you gotta take into consideration of what your capable of doing. You sound very well rounded alot of people don't expect it to be some much work. Owning and leasing are two intierly different things. Some advice about the horse buying make your appointment and do all that and ride at there barn. See if you really are in love with the horse. I would recommend taking them out of there house say a trail ride. Because you never know how a horse is going to act different than at home. Surprise them 1 time you want to see him being tacked worked, I would also recommend you do the tacking and working. Now on to your mom try and have a sit down talk with her. If you do feel a b- is acceptable tell her that you think A's and B's are good grades. Just try and talk to her and tell her whats all going on. Most parents will let up I mean it doesn't hurt to try. Do the best you can on your school work and tell your mom that two. You need to let her know your doing all you can to maintain good grades. As for your friend mabey you need to let her go. It's never healthy for some to be verbally abusive and be your friend.Its bad for both people. If truly can't let her go tell her that its not right to be mean to you. She has no reason you guys are supposed to be friends. I mean your young remind her that and your mom. I'm sure she didn't forget what its like to be a kid its tough.|`|wCcz31rGaa	you sound so much like me, that's is what i was like.<br>  <br>  you need to focus mainly on school, it's horrible to hear but it's true, there was a time in my school year, where i choose horses over sitting an exam, which was one of the biggest mistakes ever, it's like choosing boys and bunking off school. Your mum does right to push you but if it gets to much, go out for fresh air, or even confine in somebody, a friend or an e-pal via email, even me. I cant give much mom help, as their all different, but i can plainly see from what you've said, that she's the pushy kind just like my own, but can you blame her for wanting you to do well, she just wants whats best for you don't all parents?<br>  <br>  Make sure most importantly, you do your research and accept that sometimes, your going to have to say no. If your exams are just round the corner, maybe go looking now, and find a good horse, but don't get it just yet. Use it to motivate you to get straight a's in your exams, and use it as a reward, for when you achieve it. <br>  <br>  x
B6zl0AJDaa	Without the experience of training other horses in the past, raising and training a baby is a BIG undertaking.  On occassion, even us old timers screw up.  By the time we get the knowledge, our bodies don't have the strength you youngersters have.<br>  <br>  IF this is your first baby and first green horse, your best bet is to get into training under a trainer and WATCH and LEARN from the trainer as he/she handles your baby.|`|jUjkvis8aa	Well, if you're doing the job properly you should wait until the horse is at least 3 years old before even thinking about breaking him in. You should start off by getting them to accept the bridle and saddle, and then start off by having someone hold him whilst someone else slowly leans on his back to prepare him to be ridden. You should be constantly building up his trust and when you think the time is right, you should get on him for the first time. Be encouraging and very careful. <br>   So basically, it takes around 6 months to properly train your horse to be ready for riding, but it could be longer or shorter.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you have enough experience or help on-hand to break in your horse, then you could take him to one of the many people who will bring him on for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck (:|`|8bTder08aa	It is both hard and dangerous to train a green horse.  For on-the-ground training, you have to know the basics of safety around horses thoroughly; you need to be able to tell the difference between a horse that is frightened, confused, or overwhelmed by environment and a horse that is testing your authority, and know how to deal appropriately with each case.  <br>  <br>  For under-saddle work, you shouldn't even dream of trying to train a horse unless you have absolutely correct position on a horse, have completely independent, light hands, a seat that's secure enough to allow you to stay on a horse that decides to buck, bolt, or hop up-and-down on the front end preparatory for rearing.  You have to be able to maintain control of a horse that may be frightened and doing its darndest to bolt, or to buck you off, or to rear.  You need to be advanced enough in your equitation to be able to ride through any resistance or disobedience the horse may test you with.  You need to know when a horse that is resisting you is confused, frightened, angry, stubborn, and what to do in each separate case.<br>  <br>  You have to have enough experience and judgement to know when a horse is ready to progress to the next step in training and when you need to back off, be patient, and return to basics before proceeding.  You need to be able to judge whether something is within a horse's physical capabilities, and when it is not.<br>  <br>  You have to have the maturity to be able to admit when you are out of your depth and need to ask for help.  You need patience, calmness, good organization, and a willingness to let the horse tell you when it is ready to move on to the next step in training.  You need to be able to accept responsibility for your screw-ups-- and you will have screw-ups-- without making excuses and blaming others.<br>  <br>  Any fool with an ego can mess up a horse, and a lot of them do.  It takes real character and wisdom to know when you're not able to train a horse. |`|uec7RIhbaa	depends what you mean by "not professional".  if you are experienced and know what you're doing or have ehlp then it needn't be hard at all - depending on the horse of course!!!!  there is always a raging debate about when horses are ready to be ridden.  at my yard we break horses from the beginning of their 3rd year, never earlier although if there is some need (extra bolshy/very shy for example) some basic ground work can be done during their 2nd year.  before the horse is 3 however it's muscles and skeleton are not developed enough to withstand the pressures of work.  we often break when they reach their 3rd year then turn them away for a few months.  Other people would argue that even a 3 year old is not mature enough and you should wait till 4.  Again it all depends on the physical and the mental maturity of the horse.  good luck with your colt|`|MtmpOqZ7aa	Depends on your horse knowledge and experience.  I have raised/trained by colt from birth and he is now five months old.  I have never trained before.  Both my vet and my farrier are in love with him.  They say that he behaves better than most adult horses.  He cross tied before he was weaned and is excellent with his feet.  He is a really amazing baby, but I put a TON of work into him to make him that way.  <br>  <br>  Since you are asking how long until you can ride them, I suggest that you do not get a colt is you dont have that knowledge.  (Three years old is when I plan on getting on my guy, but even then it takes a while until you can really ride them.)<br>  <br>  Also, like another poster said, colts grow into stallions and need to be gelded.  That can get costly.  My vet quoted me about $300 as long as both testicles are dropped, but it can run up to $1500 is they are not dropped.  That does not include any medication that he may need.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	If you are willing to put in the hard work, ask when necessary for advice and take it when given it is quite possible.  Best time to start is from day 1!  It will make the job a whole lot easier!<br>  <br>  Aim to be backing at around 3 and lightly riding for a few months and then turning him away to allow him to grow.  However when you back him will be dependent a) on how he handles what he has learned already, and b) his physical make up.  Some take a while to grow and then suddenly shoot up and out!|`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	Well, it depends I guess.  Just because you aren't a 'professional' doesn't mean you don't know alot.  You don't say how old the colt is, or how experienced you are so this makes the question a little difficult to answer.<br>  Colts can be difficult to train largely due to raging hormones, however if there aren't any fillies/mares nearby you shouldn't have too much of a problem.  Also there's loads of books on the subject of training horses.  Colts are not unique in their training requirements, they should be brought on in the same way you'd bring on any young horse.<br>  Starting with lunging, I'm a big fan of lunging as it teaches the horse to balance itself correctly without having to deal with a rider on its back.<br>  Introduce new things slowly, I have this saying that I hold to in all situations: "If you rush a horse, it will make you wait."  So take the time now while the horse is young, rather than rush through things, and then have to restart everything a year down the line when things fall apart.<br>  There's no set in stone way of starting and training, in my opinion at anyrate, each horse must be treated as an individual, some learn alot quicker than others, some require different methods than others.<br>  The most important thing is patience, a horse will always try your patience, so don't lose your rag with them.<br>  As I said before, introduce things slowly, be absolutely 110% positive that the horse understands what you're teaching it before moving on to the next thing.  Having said this, you also have to keep things interesting, so keep your training sessions short. Set a small task that you wish to accomplish each session and work on that.<br>  ALWAYS finish the session on a positive note.<br>  When in doubt, speak to someone who maybe has more experience, but don't be afraid to develop your own sense of how the horse should be brought on...this is going to be your horse, and should be brought on according to your needs.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!:)|`|K445xADnaa	Training Young horses is a daunting prospect. If you don't know what your doing this can make things even more daunting.<br>  If you don't know the basic stuff (like how long it takes for them to be ridable) then I would say leave it alone.<br>  If it's a "colt" (entire male) then the process and workload can be doubled. Not only do you have the breaking issues to deal with but also the testosterone! <br>  If you know the basics then breaking your own (with help ) can be very rewarding & a bond is formed like no other.<br>  Think very hard about trying this. Please.<br>  It is very easy to mess up a youngster and very hard to undo mistakes.|`|wTLb3v3Xaa	Well Im about 1 year ahead of you! lol I got two 1 year old fillies last year.<br>  I had never trained a horse before but was experienced in riding. <br>  so lets see First off you cant start riding the horse until its 2 years old regardless of how much it knows. Also NO ONE can say it will take you this long to get a horse ready for riding as that is impossible to know it all depends on your skill in training the age of the horse and the method's you choose to use.<br>  how hard they are to train depends on the horse also and What do you want to train the horse in ? I'm training mine in jumping and the other in reining. each one takes a different amount of time. anyways good luck  the road ahead of you will be rocky but fun! Enjoy yourself and stay safe!|`|Y6xLu77aaa	I have a five month old gelded colt and I am  a first time horse owner. I've had him since he was just a few weeks old. I got a trainer to give me tips and alittle help, but alot of the training I did my self. He is now halter broke and able to lead. He has a great disposition though so is fairly easy. Definitely get a trainer to give you some help and listen to instructions, it helps alot.|`|5kUxkun3aa	i have a mare at home that i bred.and i work at a racing stud.my mare at home was handled from the start.did everything with the "older horse"led everywhere picked her feet out everyday etc.the foals at the yard get handled when needed.and start their bridle work at 1yrs.they get the all what she had at a steady pace for a year done to them in a couple of weeks.within a couple of months they are under the saddle.<br>  when i bred mine i had never done it before.although i had owned older horses.i found much of it common sense.<br>  you would slowly progress your youngsters learning until they are around 4yrs some are done sooner and turned away for 6months to mature.be consistent with what you teach him.he will then respect you and know what you are wanting from him.<br>  read loads of books and ask for help if you need it.<br>  <br>  have fun.it well worth the time you have to put in.<br>   you cannot believe the feeling you get when you first ride your baby!!!    |`|CsC2xqM9aa	It will be hard to train a colt unless you are experienced.. consider gatting a trainer to help or give you advice- a colt needs to be at least 2 yo before training. Remeber, a colt will grow into a stallion and that could become a hand full consider making him a gelding..|`|di5gDRDDaa	Lots of sensible advice already here,are you planning on keeping him entire ?..in which case,  unless you have your own land remember that a lot of livery yards will not accept stallions and you will need to make sure that you have very secure fencing !!<br>  
IMPvzBk1aa	Unless you are well trained on bandage wrapping, don't attempt to wrap this, or you may further the damage.  This requires a vet to diagnose...it does sound like a tendon bow.  there are varying degrees of bowed tendon injuries, and you need the vet to evaluate this.  You can't know the proper treatment without an accurate diagnosis.  At least get on the phone and describe the symptoms to your vet, and get an opinion as to whether he needs to see the horse, and follow his advice on treatment.<br>  <br>  EDIT...I don't know if you will even see this.  I would not give bute without first speaking to the vet, for a multitude of reasons including that you shoudn't mask symptoms that the vet may need to see if he decides to come, which is not unlikely.  The fact that the swelling goes up the leg as it does makes abscess a less likely cause, unless infection has spread diffusely into the skin tissue, as in cellulitis, which is serious.|`|pfbIm4lEaa	Cold hose 3 (or more) times a day for 15-20 minutes<br>  <br>  Wrap with poultice overnight, wash off in AM (do this daily until the swelling/heat is gone)<br>  <br>  1 tab of bute twice a day for 3 days. If he is *really* uncomfortable, a dose of banamine in place of a dose of bute may be necessary<br>  <br>  Stall rest until he is completely comfortable moving around on it.<br>  <br>  It does sound like a tendon injury, and all the vet will tell you is stall rest. (They could also do an ultrasound or MRI to see exactly what is wrong, but those are costly)|`|6k9sFtBdaa	What you described here could be a bowed tendon. Puffy swelling with mininal heat is what normally occurs, unless the really tear the tendon. One of my horses had that same problem. If I were you I would call the vet, that way you can get an ultrasound of the leg to see what the extent of the damage is. Then follow their reccomended instructions as to how to treat it.<br>  <br>  However I would get him off of that hilly pasture and put him somewhere flat for the time being.|`|ZB8x6HOzaa	If it were a small injury, I doubt he would be lying down more frequently. That really concerns me, because when a horse stays down too long the weight of their bodies can actually crush their internal organs. Also, the amount of swelling and the fact that he doesn't want to put any weight on it suggests that this could be a major injury. Call the vet out before it worsens.|`|CuGzQIgvaa	could be a bowed tendon or "cording" but if you don't excercise the horse or wrap the leg a lot then i doubt its cording.|`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	You shuold be bandaging the joint, a good firm bandage that will offer plenty of support.  You should also keep your horse box bound until such time as all signs of lameness or pain have gone.  <br>  Tendon injuries are all major in my opinion.<br>  It would also be a good idea to have your vet come out and check on it.<br>  <br>  Oh, hmmm...this could also be an abcess.  I've seen it where, if an abcess is particularly bad a horses joints will swell.  Check the hoof for heat, and see if you can feel a pulse on the back of the pastern, the fact that he's not showing any signs of pain on flexion, but is unwilling to put weight can be indicative.<br>  <br>  Either way it sounds like your horse could also do with 3/4 days of bute.<br>  <br>  Hope it all works out,<br>  <br>  Kismet.
bQrTAlTpaa	I think that reputable breeders have been working very hard to improve the temperament and trainability of the breed.  Try and see the documentary "Breed all about it" on the Chow Chow.

They tend to be a one-person dog, and a lot of them are not raised/trained properly.  I used to work for a vet and we did not have one nice Chow ever.

0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	I hate to say it but you're not going to be able to avoid surgery forever.  You're really hammering your knees, especially with the amount of aggressive-type riding you're doing. 10 hours of lessons a week? my goodness, that's just insane, why?!?!?!<br>  Anyway, you should REALLY go to a doctor, seriously, think about it this way, if you keep going the way you are, in short order you'll never be riding ever again, and I'm not kidding.<br>  Your doctor will probably suggest surgery, but if you're really adament about not having it then he may put you on a course of intensive anti-inflammatories.<br>  In the mean time, I suggest you also get yourself a really good product called Corta-flex.  I give it to my racehorses who have joint problems - here's the website:  <a href="http://www.cortaflex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cortaflex.com/</a> It's a seriously good product and it doesn't taste too bad...I know, because I take it.<br>  <br>  Really though, I can't stress enough how important it is for you to go see a doctor.  If you place any value in your riding you'll take the time NOW to get the problem fixed.  I guess you just gotta weigh it up yourself, keep riding and ignore the problem now, or 2/3 years down the line find that you'll probably never ride a horse again...<br>  <br>  Eitherway,  good luck to you!:)|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Are you wearing long boots or short boots, short boots with chaps are better. My knees get a little stiff sometimes when I'm riding, yet I went to Spain and rode there for a week, 4 hours in the saddle, no pain! I put it down to riding long and straight and little or no rising trot, just walk, canter and gallop, on a horse that moved so beautifully, its canter was like a rocking horse, and I didn't need to put my leg on at all.<br>  <br>  Make sure your not trying to grip with your knees also as canter shouldn't hurt. Make sure you're riding a responsive horse and not one that needs to be constantly booted along. A horse that moves on with just a squeeze yet doesn't run off with you is what you need, something easy on the legs!! Definitely make sure you're riding with longer stirrups, as long as you feel comfortable with without losing your stirrups all the time.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Are you a candidate for joint replacement?  Is it osteoarthritis in your knees, or another arthritic condition?  You say your mom wants you to have surgery, but you don't say why, or what surgery.  Those knees have to last a lifetime....they should be your first priority, even if that means taking a break from riding now in order to be able to ride or be able to function well for the rest of your life.  You say you don't like braces because they interfere with your boots....have you tried to modify the boots to accommodate the knee supports you obviously need?  I'm a former orthopedic nurse who has seen the full blown debility that knee problems can mean in your life.  Put your priorities where they should be on this.  I can't imagine that 5 lessons a week for two hours each in any way conforms to medical recommendations in your case.  Get your advice from your orthopedic specialist, and follow it to the letter, or risk spending your life on the sidelines watching other people do what you love doing.|`|AA10776535	I feel your pain...I was struck by a one ton truck on my left side and needed surgery on my left knee...MISTAKE...doctor screwed me up even more...Get on the horse is one thing, getting off is a screaming fit for me most of the time, OMG the pain.

PAIN<br>  What i do if I'm planning on riding long is wear knee braces the soft kind looks like an ace bandage...Now there is this brace you can wear to ride that you can make hot or cold, I'll save this post and get back to you as soon as i remember the name, it works really well.  You can buy them at most drug stores.  <br>  You need to talk to your doctor about anti inflammatories, there are some that will help ease you pain.  You probably have to be on something regularly.<br>  There is also a rub stuff, begins with a "T" I'll have to get that name and where to get it from our trainer here and get back to you with that name to, works wonders for her, i should try it to come to think of it.<br>  But start with your doctor, maybe cut back your training so you have time to get your body adjusted...Heck pain i live with everyday and i do have some pretty bad days, today being one of them...Don't kill your body, you need to enjoy the ride, not dread putting on your boots.<br>  |`|PEPWFGNGaa	I have one very bad knee - have had surgery on it but it still isn't right and will give out/swell up at the slightest provocation.<br>  I take Glucosamine and Ibuprofen ( NSAID - think of it like Bute - lol)<br>  Also I will wear a wrap around support when it is bad - this is the type where it fastens with velcro and is practically invisible under jodhs.<br>  <br>  If the surgery that is being recommended to you is anything like what I had it's a keyhole procedure but you'll still lose 6 weeks riding after it and like I said mine helped but did not solve the whole issue.

I wrap my knees before riding and it helps a lot. Just don't put the liniminte under it or else it blisters... made that mistake. It's thin enough that you can put tall boots on over it and it doesn't cause it to roll up or anything as long as you have breeches on.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	A friend of mine who I got started into trail riding has had three surgeries and pins in one knee.  She takes the following steps.  1.  She gets on from the trailer or tailgate so she does not have to bounce.  2.  Uses a stirrup straightener so that the stirrup leathers are not torquing her knee.  and 3.  Rides in a slightly over sized saddle so that her legs are more relaxed out in front of her.<br>  <br>  She started this summer and has already been on 14 mile rides without a problem.  When she first started a 7 mile ride was about the most she could handle and it took several of those to get where she wasn't hurting by the end.  The stirrup straighteners helped tremendously. <br>  <br>  Edit  Now that you say that you are a jumper/eventer that changes what you can do.  Try taking glucoseamine-chondriton tablets.  They can be purchased at Walmart.  They are the same glucoseamine and chondriton for horses but in human sized doses and produced by USDA standards (pet supplements can legally be the sweepings off the floor).  These supplements (they come in one pill) help you body repair and rebuild joints.  They are said to help arthritis considerably and I took them when my shoulder was broken.  They did work great for that.  I currently have no arthritis but have broken enough bones I will probably have to start taking some within a few years.|`|meyvIZVzaa	Gahh, I'm still young so I'm okay but my mum is always complaining about her knees hurting while we're out riding.

I had surgery on my back a couple years ago and when I started riding again after the surgery I was in a lot of pain from arthritis that has now set in.    <br>  <br>    A friend of mine who I was working with at the time suggested I try drinking cherry juice.  SHe said that it somehow has anti-inflamatory qualities and that it will help with arthritis.  She said that she knew  a lady who had such bad arthritis in her hands that she couldn't do the crocheting or fine needlework anymore and after a couple weeks of drinking the juice, was able to knit, crochet, and even do the fine needlework and lace doilies.<br>  <br>   I only drink about 16 ounces a day, but my arthritis isn't really that bad, and it's made a difference.  It took a couple weeks for me to notice any difference at all, but now I wouldn't be without it.  I also found a glucosomine supplement that I take, but I don't think it helps as much as the cherry juice does.  You could try the Glucosomine (just make sure it doesn't have the chondroitin in it, the chondroitin counteracts the glucosomine in people).  But I would seriously recommend the CHERRY JUICE.|`|5TCewPYRaa	Hey, I have bad knees too--and I'm only 16!! Can't wait till I'm older! Haha! Anyways when I'm riding, if my knees start to bug me, I take a little bit of a break, take my feet out of the stirrups, stretch them out while my horse gets a breather, if they are hurting I'll take an Advil or Tylenol....I also have pain killers/ anti-inflammatories for them if they really hurt...maybe go to your Doctor and see if you could get a prescription for your knee pain....I wear a brace on my left knee basically all the time,except when I'm riding (I'm supposed too...) because it give me saddle sores as it constantly rubs! Ouch!! I lowered my regular stirrup length 1 hole, but I have to shorten it for barrel racing and gaming...so it doesnt really help when I have to ride all day at a show! <br>  <br>  Good Luck, <br>  BR<3|`|eCjgCSIkaa	I have a really bad knee...I no how much it hurts when riding! I do a lot of jumping and trekking but i just lenghten my stirrups...but just enough to be able to post!. Other than that i have done a lot of bare back riding on my horse and that seems to make my legs and knees stornger...now i can ride in my saddle without any probs just from riding bareback to help my legs get stronger...<br>  my mate damaged her knee a few months back and has just got into bareback riding and already she is feeling much more pain releif. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck! 
nIskOkn2aa	I would only have a horse shot if it was in agony and no vet was within reasonable reach to euthanize it, as in a broken leg on the trail.  I much prefer euthanasia.<br>  <br>  If you shoot them, it can be ugly, but the carcase is not dangerous and can be used for meat.<br>  <br>  If you euthanize them, they must be disposed of properly.  Nothing can be allowed to eat the remains as the euthanasia solution remains lethal and will kill whatever tries.  You can't just leave them unburied or donate them to a zoo for meat.<br>  <br>  To dispose of the carcase, usually you have to have the carcase hauled away and disposed of (usually it gets dumped in a landfill) - this will cost about $250 + mileage.<br>  <br>  You can have the horse euthanized where it will be buried - vet fees vary, but burial costs $300 for the back hoe, + the cost of the site (huge!) if not on your own property.  This is illegal in most places because of the likelihood of water table contamination and so on.  If you go ahead anyway, make sure you have plenty of land to protect your neighbors and your well.<br>  <br>  You can have the horse cremated.  In this area, that runs about $1200.00 plus transport fees ($250 + mileage).<br>  <br>  When it's necessary and unavoidable, I always try to have the horse euthanized on my property and then buried.  They're calmer and it just seems kinder.  Twice I've had a horse die at the equine hospital; I've had the knackers bring it back for burial.  If it's not a long trip back, I prefer to bring them home to die, but that's not always kind or possible.   <br>  <br>  Whether you have the horse shot, euthanized, or it dies of natural causes, you still have to dispose of it.<br>  <br>  I hope your question was hypothetical, and you're not faced with the situation now.  It's always best to know what to do in advance, because trying to find an excavator willing to come NOW and do something he may not want to do is difficult, especially if you can't stop crying.<br>  <br>  |`|Gc94X8Cjaa	You talk to the vet about options.  The vet will know the different ways availble in your area for disposal of the body.  Shooting is perfectly fine if you know what you are doing.  If not, get the vet out to either euthanize or use a humane killer on the horse.  I suspect which the method is used depends on the area you are in.  <br>  <br>  People who have land often bury the horse on their property.  If you don't have enough land, or it's not allowed, there's cremation or rendering, or as one person suggested, the body goes to feed captive animals. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|GdTESFOLaa	I grew up on a large farm with cattle and horses, we put down(shot) several cattle,and then just drug the carcass with a tractor to a remote corner of the farm for carrion to feed on(only if the vet couldn't fix them up well enough to make it to the next auction, that's money on the hoof).........but horses are different,they have intelligence, character ,and personality.....when we had to get rid of one we took it to a horse sale, there are buyers there that only purchase sickly stock to sell to pet food companies or glue factory's or thermal plants....it's a common practice...........this solution works really well when children are involved, they only think the horse is being sold.....they don't see a carcass, or burial site, or even know it's dead.<br>      I've luckily, never dealt with a traumatically injured horse........I suppose it  would have to be shot.|`|AA11779006	I'm old enough to remember a time when horses were shot because there was never a vet near enough to be able to do anything else . They also at times if possible took a horse to a sight they could bury it and do the whole deed then and there . But with the changes over the years euthanizing is much more humane . If one knows for sure without doubt that the horse cannot recover , its best for the horse to be put down then allow it to suffer . <br>  If your on your own farm or land , i suggest you bury it there . Some cities and things have ordinances one must follow it depends on what the laws are where you live .|`|3SWe11Knaa	One time while flipping through the phone book I found a place that cremated horses.

He will figure out some way to end his misery...|`|809dAyOiaa	I drop them in a giant vat of McDonald's Brand French Fry Oil.

The horse is usually moved after death - otherwise you're looking at transporting a very unwell or seriously injured horse, which isn't fair.  The journey would be too stressful for the animal.  I have in the past arranged for the knacker man to come at the same time as the vet, so he's there as soon as it's done and can go about the practicalities of the death immediately.  (I have known a knacker man to be late, and it's not pleasant at all.)|`|pHNKGXYXaa	Most people would take them to the vet to be humanly euthanized. Only in the old west did they shoot them because they did not have vets or medicine to "put them to sleep". Sometimes now adays people will sell the horses dead body to a nearby glue factory to turn the horses hooves into glue. Or if you really cared about the horse and loved it you could hire someone you know who owns a towing company (or a forklift) to move the horse to where you wish to bury it. Another way to move the carcass to be buried is to use a sling, put the sling under the horse's body and have the fire department come with a truck and pick it up and move the body. I personally believe the best way to bury it is to try to move the horse to the burial site before you euthanize it then have the vet come and "put it to sleep" there then place it into the pre-dug hole. Hope I helped!   |`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	Shooting is still a common way of putting a horse down.  However, the horse is usually tranquilised first.  <br>  I wouldn't have my horse euthenaised because I've seen too many horses react badly, and end up going through more trauma.  When I've had to have horses put down they've been shot.  We usually send to carcasses to the local crocodile farm, or the lion park (but only if it's been an 'emergency' like a broken leg)...erm, you can bury them, but you have to check with the local authorities on that.|`|8mn2l3rCaa	I had an Arab/quarter horse mix that at age 28 her knees were sore all the time and she was unable to swallow her food due to a problem in her throat.  I had quit riding her about 10 years ago due to her knees.  She was what alot of people call a pasture ornament.  I took her to the vet who verified that she was suffering and there was not any good options for recovery.  He gave an injection in our trailer and we took her back to her pasture, where a neighbor with construction equipment buried her for me.  I had her since she was 2 years old.  She deserved her retirement just as she deserved not to suffer. |`|ckLWeYqoaa	at the farm i go to you euthanize the horse. i don't know of anyone who shoots them. i think that shooting them would be horrible. just euthanize it. and we have a backhoe and we dig a big whole and move the horse there and bury it in one of the not used as much paddocks. ive never watched it so i don't actually know how they move it but im guessing with the backhoe|`|5UGJZ4ABaa	I have a horse, and no one shoots them when they're sick.

Before one buries a horse on their property, they should assure that the laws allow it.  And beyond that, if there is a shallow water table, consider the possibility of contamination of ground water (and your own well water) if you bury the carcass.  When a renderer is called, they remove the body from the site.|`|WPLKVdBKaa	back in my hay day,we used to shoot them(lived on outback farms)<br>  and yes they would be dragged off to be buried,as for cattle they were fed to other animals or us..<br>  today,i would have a vet put it to sleep and we have a animal cemetry not from here and i would have a burial or cremation(its costly),but we do that now for all our pets.<br>  ive owned 7 horses myself.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	They used to have the big trucks that came and collected them for lard when I was a kid.

D1beU6MPaa	Eating manure -- "coprophagia" is what the vet may call it -- is normal, even desirable, in foals during the first four or five months of life. It jump-starts the bacteria they need to digest solid food and may also serve to boost their immune system. <br>  <br>  In older horses, however, it often indicates a nutritional deficiency of some kind. The first thing I'd look at is the availability of a mineral block -- especially if the horse is also eating dirt or wood. Next, I'd ask about the energy content of the feed -- sometimes a horse will pick through manure because it usually contains a lot of undigested grain. Finally, I'd want to know if the horse has adequate pasture or hay available at all times and if the horse can move around enough. A horse is a grazing animal, and if normal roughage isn't available it will often start eating anything it finds. Boredom can also prompt a horse to "graze" manure just because it's better than standing around with nothing to do. In the latter case a horse ball is sometimes enough of a diversion to stop the behavior. Try to identify -- and stop -- whatever is causing the behavior, because it can be a hard habit to break once it gets established. <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	It is a common problem and it usually means that horses are lacking in certain minerals and vitamins in their diet.  <br>  <br>  As she is young and a thoroughbred it would be worth getting her blood checked to determine exactly which ones she needs more of and then she will need these in her feed in the form of supplements.|`|QMl4ELhGaa	The only horse I ever encountered that did this did so because they were on stall rest about 24/7.

There are a few reasons: boredom; insecurity; lack of protein / bulk feed and / or trace elements; and genuine hunger.<br>  <br>  If it's the latter two, she needs more to eat.  Horses should be eating for at least 18hrs a day - she needs a constant supply of forage (grass, or hay if you don't have enough grass) to keep her gut healthy.<br>  <br>  If it's the first two, she needs more to do - possibly some different toys if she's bored of the ones you've given her, and some friends!|`|aNtlzmAHaa	If your horse is eating its own manure, this most likely means one of two things: 1. Your horse is bored. You need to give her more time in the pasture, streching her legs, etc. Are there any horses in the stalls around her? If not, maybe she is lonely. If you cannot afford a companion horse, get a mini, or even a cat! 2. She isn't getting enough vitamins. Give her supplements. Number 2 is the most likely.|`|zGQXZRpCaa	when a foal is born you should always leave it in a yard with its mum so it eats her poo it puts all the minerals and vitamins it2 it your horse is eating manure coz she isn't getting the minerals she needs its the same when they lick wire n metal the not getting zinc you can buy mineral supplements from your produce just ask them about it .  |`|5kUxkun3aa	as long as it is her's don't think it should do her alot of harm. although i do think she should be stopped. some would say its a hunger thing. but if there is hay/grass and feed for the horse why should it do it. as she has done it for a while she has now got into he habit.<br>  try not to leave her pooh around as much as you can.|`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	I have a couple fillies in the yard who started doing this.

Did you breed and raise her? Sometimes starved horses do this out of desperation to eat. If she never went through this, then look at her diet. Can she graze in a pasture somewhere? Give her more hay or feed her more frequently. Have a salt block in her stall? High quality vit/min supplements in her food? Worm her once a month and rotate these for a while, because she will reinfect herself constantly. If your hay is too course, she's not getting enough nutritional value to her hay. She could have learned this behavior from her dam, because she was starved. Give her soaked beet pulp to supplement her diet. Feed high fiber grain with her high quality grain.|`|d9aAMRkFaa	she hasn't had enough vitamins and nutrients.

B6zl0AJDaa	Some horses can't handle different types of hay and Wheat Hay is something that's not normally fed because the grains in natural form can work their way up into the lips and gums of horses and abcess.  Try timothy or oat hay or a mix of the two, but do it gradually.<br>  <br>  You can also paste worm him just in case he has any worms and that should clean him out of parasites.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Please refer to my answer on your other question...I think the red cell is a problem.|`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	Aside from wheat hay what else does your horse get fed?  I'm not familiar with the kind of roughage you're feeding at the moment as we don't get it here in South Africa.  Diarrhea can be caused by lots of things, large amounts of protien rich food can be one cause, so I'd definately check that out.  A probiotic should also help with a sloppy gut.  Deworm again, make sure your deworming is done on a regular, 3-4 month basis.  I haven't heard of it being caused by change of water-intake, but it sounds plausable.<br>  Try putting him onto a different kind of hay, and try changing his diet to something a little less rich, just a thought.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you manage to sort out your horse's problem, good luck,<br>  <br>  Kismet.|`|Iii06VUoaa	my horse has diherra too : ( .... she gets it at the beginning of summer and at the end of summer and I asked my horse trainer why and he said it's because she's changing her water in take.|`|9VhGHRcGaa	When I used to have horses mine would only get it when they had to much Alfalfa.

8bTder08aa	It sounds to me as if you're dealing with a situation where someone got kicked in a schooling ring, and someone is now suing.<br>  <br>  This is the website for USEF:  <a href="http://www.usef.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usef.org/</a><br>  <br>  I did a quick search, and I didn't find anything that deals with schooling areas.  Maybe you'll have better luck, but I doubt it.  The USEF rules are mainly in regard to competitions, and I doubt if they'd touch on what goes on in a schooling area.<br>  <br>  You might check with the facility where the incident occurred, and see if they have any rules or guidelines, but I suspect you'll find that they just have some vague "motherhood" statement about people not behaving in unsafe ways.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about litigation, you probably should see a lawyer.  FWIW, if this situation goes to litigation, most of the people involved in passing judgement on it are not going to be expert horsemen.  <br>  <br>  A lot might depend on whether the horse that did the kicking had a history of kicking under similar circumstances, and whether the rider of the horse knew the horse had a history of kicking.  If the rider knew that the horse had a history of kicking in a crowded ring where people are moving in both directions and in close quarters, I think a reasonable person would determine that the rider should not have taken the horse into those conditions without warning the other riders that the horse was predisposed to kicking.<br>  <br>  If the horse was not known for kicking, or if the rider had no knowledge that the horse was known to kick under those circumstances, then I think it all depends on whether the rider exercised the reasonable precautions that all riders exercise in order to minimize the chance of someone getting kicked.<br>  <br>  FWIW, while I'm not a lawyer, I've known a few people who were involved in lawsuits on either plaintiff or defendant side, and I have to tell you that if you really want to piss someone off quick, try telling someone who has gotten hurt that it's their own darn fault and if they'd been more careful it wouldn't have happened.  Particularly if you are the person who they believe is responsible for their being hurt.  Even if you've got the law on your side, you're going to make them mad.<br>  <br>  Some advice from a non-lawyer, free advice, worth what you pay for it:  if your horse kicked someone else and you knew your horse was inclined to kick, ask a lawyer what he or she would charge to defend the case if the other party files suit against you.  If what the other party is asking is less than a lawyer would cost to defend you, PAY THEM and get them to sign an agreement that the settlement is in lieu of legal action.  <br>  <br>  ...And for sure, if there's the possibility of litigation, don't run around bleating to all and sundry that it's the other guy's fault.  Do your best immitation of a clam and don't say anything.  If people ask about the situation, just tell them that you can't talk about it.  Repeat as necessary.|`|zk5VBdLEaa	i think that unless you have a red ribbon in you horses tail, you should pay for whatever damage happens to the horse that was kicked. that is common curtesy because you know your horse is a kicker, then you must notify people and even if it is a mistake, then you should own up to your horses mistake and pay for it! or at least some!|`|bXfqoZefaa	I'm not to sure about Usef rules but where i show you have to put a red ribbon in their tail to let riders and others know your horse is a kicker.

5750c8ed6e36c08baa63c0651369908eaa	Some things to try:<br>  <br>  1.  Cut back on the grain.  Unless your vet has a precise reason for him getting a lot of grain, cut back to just a little bit as a treat.  Feed more hay, less grain.<br>  <br>  2.  Longe before you ride, for fifteen or twenty minutes if your horse is very hyper or fresh.  Takes the edge off and any bucking should be done and over with by the time you get on.<br>  <br>  3.  Be prepared and ready, and when he bucks, continue riding through it.  For instance, don't allow him to stop cantering if he bucks...make him keep working so he doesn't feel rewarded for acting naughty.<br>  <br>  4.  Hang on and good luck.<br>  <br>  *Edit to GentleH:  What I meant by riding through it was the same thing as you said:  keep his feet moving and keep making him work.  I didn't mean just let him keep bucking.<br>  <br>  And my fourth point was off?  So you would advise her to just let go and fall?|`|qI6oPzA0aa	i hav a gelding that had this same problem, this is what i did:<br>  1. when ever you're ridding just as you're warming up do lots and lots of figure eights/ circles both ways and the entire time trot.-you need to get him to respect you- <br>  2. even though he's trained to ride- lounge him with a saddle on- make him trot, and then lope- canter in a circle around you. once he starts to canter let him go around at least three times then stop him and pet him. <br>  3. then when you ride him get him to a lope and if he starts to buck pull him to a walk. if he bucks you off don't give up get back on him!!! even if you have to walk in a circle. <br>  i hope this helps- good luck!!<br>  |`|RThxTnHZaa	My horse never got on the rail and bucked whenever we cantered but these were all times when she had no respect for me. You could do someground work for a while but you probably need to show him who is boss. Show him he can't get you off and he needs to listen to you and what not. Now my horse goes to the rail willingly (except the corners) and she only puts her ears back when cantering she doesnt buck anymore though. Good luck!|`|ccfe2b68a7c14fa4dde7c45db5e53ae2aa	The first two things that Dai said are VERY good points, but the last two are way off.  Anytime a horse starts bucking, if you allow it to continue the habit will only get worse.  When he starts to buck, pull his head around to your toe if possible.  But keep his feet moving, and keep trying to canter.  It's extremely hard for a horse to turn a very tight circle and buck, in fact it's impossible if the circle is tight enough that their back feet have to cross to perform the circle.  Also try long trotting a lot before you ask for the canter.  That way the canter will be a welcome relief for his muscles.  If you feel him tense up to buck, pull his head around.<br>  <br>  If he's only bucking at the canter, he's doing it playing around, not because he's not trained, but you have to put a stop to it very quickly.  Make it easier for him to canter on the rail than to buck and it should bring a stop to it fairly quickly.  Good luck|`|I6NwduJPaa	my horse used to do this all the time, luckely he didnt buck very high. You should do what the previous people have said,<br>  <br>  but first, how are you asking?

Also, check your tack.|`|htWtHCIfaa	you need to show your horse who's boss. maybe all you need is patience and all he needs is some more training. how old is he, that could be a factor. also, before you ride him, lunge him to get rid of his extra energy that could turn into bucking and other behaviors like it.<br>  I hope I helped. |`|204cc5453593d71b4d4819e7abe47305aa	You have a lot of good suggestions regarding training, I just have one other - you should rule out any physical problems that may be causing your horse to buck.

You're asking for hurt, pain and teaching the horse to spook to get rid of you.  Unless you're in peril of getting hurt by staying on the horse, you should try to stick with him until you can control his feet.<br>  <br>  I've ridden for all my 41 years.  I've started my first horse hoping to do so by myself without luck.  She has a penchant for spooking due to lack of confidence in herself and in me which has been fed by my poor choices in trainers then trying to start her myself.  I've been pitched, fallen off and now I've lost much of my confidence and am working on getting it back.  The horse, when he spooks just needs to get out of there and move his feet - let him, then control him when he gets away from what's scaring him.<br>  <br>  While you're down, you can learn A LOT about how to avoid the situation you're in.  Because I guarantee ya, you're going to encounter it again.  If he spooked once, he'll do it again and you need to be prepared.  If he's spooked, he needs to go back to some basics to become trustworthy again before going out and I'd suggest leaving the bareback pad aside for a while until he's solid.<br>  <br>  You can learn so much for free - go search "natural horsemanship" and soak up all the free knowledge you can by reading all the content the web offers.  Search "Vaqueo Horsemanship' and read all that content too.  Have someone get you 'western horseman' magazine and read all that.  See about buying or borrowing books.  Ones like Buck Brannaman's "Believe" and "The Faraway Horses" would feed your need by giving you knowledge.   If there's a place to rent horse videos go rent some and watch all you can.  If you get RFD TV watch all that you can.<br>  <br>  Apply everything you can pickup and make a plan for how you'll get back to square one and start right.  Heck, there's a couple boosk/videos you can buy pretty cheap that I think are very informative and I'd watch 'em again and again - one if by Clinton Anderson "WHY does my horse do that?" - I just found it in Valley Vet Supply for $25.  The other I've liked lately is "Horse, Follow Closely" by GaWaNi Ponyboy.  I got the softcover book (it's beautiful) and DVD from Horse.com for $20.<br>  <br>  That should keep ya quite busy for 3 months.  Wish I had such an opportunity (without the pain and medical bills).<br>  <br>  Come back here and share what ya learn with the rest of us and tell us how you're doing.  Most of all, focus on getting better - rushing too fast will hurt ya more in the end and take more time away from the horses you love.<br>  <br>  |`|MK8nvkaxaa	July 29th this year, I did the same!  Only I didn't have surgery.  I am still having problems with my knee.  A few years ago, a horse reared and fell over on me, and I did have knee surgery (the other knee) and had to stay off for awhile.  Thank god my babies are gentle and I could still hobble around enough to bury my face in their neck and inhale that horsey smell that keeps me sane.  They are my therapy and I have to be able to talk to them even if it means I have to feed them treats over the fence.  Good luck ya!  Been there done that.|`|vJzhTQPeaa	Hi, cheer up you'll be able to take short visits soon and that will help!<br>  <br>  I don't know of a support group, but I bet we could start one!<br>  <br>  I was trailering a Mare I own to the vets for a pregnancy check and the girl who was helping me tide her into the trailer (straight load) to tight.   To make a long story short she started fraling around and went up into the manger...I though she would tear apart my poor trailer, so I ran in to release her from the tie down, when she came down she was so quick she bent my right arm backwards over a iron bar that seperates the trailer..just above my wrist, it didn't break though.  6 weeks to the day of the accident (which left a very ugly bruise from the tips of my fingers to my elbow), I was rushed into the hospial short of breath and really in some bad pain in my chest.  I was admitted to the hospital for a nice mini vacation of 7 days with 5 blood clots in the lungs and one in my aorta!  I went home for a day and a half only to find myself back at the hospital and re admitted this time in full Cardiomyopathy with Dialated Congestive Heart Failure!  <br>  <br>  The Doctor that took care of me told me, to mend my ways and sell my horses..I told him, if he wanted to kill me to tell me that again!  I also told him about the foal my mare had and told him within a year I would bring him back a Grand Champion and I did!  My colt was GC in Halter for yearlings and Grandchamp of the class for NSH and he was reserve for Pinto classes!  He did that for the next four years, I could show him myself, but I had a good friend who's son acted as a catch handler for me, I was to weak to walk and couldn't have done it, but I knew I had a winner!  My Colt (now a gelding) is the Son of PF to the MAX, a Pinto Saddlebread out of my Bay Arabian Mare A great grand daughter of Morafic and a 4 way cross to Nazeer!  You should seehim!<br>  <br>  you may write me anytime at vrgnstnm@q.com or jennys58@yhoo.com!<br>  <br>  I have also broken both legs at the same time along with my left arm and collarbone! that's a whle different story!  I had 5 and now only 4
4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Nope - kudos to you for adopting this gal.  Anyone who says you made a bad choice, ignore them!<br>  <br>  You went about things the way I wish many who visit her would = taking riding lessons, then adopting a somewhat mature horse rather than taking on a youngster as a foal.<br>  <br>  I have 41 years with horses - in the past 10 years I have had accelerated learning about all the things I didn't know (by getting my first foal whom I thought I was ready for after riding for 25 years - trust me, there's a lot to know).<br>  <br>  I would suggest one thing first - you don't have to move at anyone's pace other than your own.  If it takes you twice as long as anyone thinks it should to do anything, it doesn't matter - you are doing what you are doing for the horse and you, no one else.<br>  <br>  another thing, you are taking on a horse that isn't just green, she's more than green - she's not had the best upbringing in her first 4 years of life and at 4 she's still pliable mentally - she's by no means mature at all.  she's still got 4 years of physical growth and 4 years of time to mentally mature.  At 8 years old, she is just getting to be an adult.<br>  <br>  Now that I've said that, I'd suggest the best place to start is at the beginning.  Sure, you've been riding for 15 years, but what do you know about horse interaction besides control from atop and proper riding cues?  I don't know, so I'll work from thinking you know little - start off learning the nature of horses - waht drives them to do everything they do?  How do they act in a herd.  The horse, as a prey animal and a herd animal, cannot be given human attributes - this is where people fall into a trap it takes a lot of time to get out of.  You must understand that the horse is part of a herd anytime it's around another being - you, other horses, etc.  Between you and she, there's a herd of two - and you must fully understand herd dynamics to become her trusted and respected leader - in a horse's eyes, not a human's.  when you learn what drives them (food, safety and social structure) you can make some inferences as to how she perceives every interaction you have with her and you'll realize why some things work well and others don't.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a few starting points - low on the investment scale would be a DVD by Clinton Anderson "WHY does my horse do that?".  I found it the other night for $25 in Valley Vet Supply catalog I get each month or so.  If you can't find it on the internet and you don't get the catalog, I'll be glad to give you a phone number or something to get it.<br>  <br>  Higher on the investment scale is a program such as Chris Cox offers, Pat Parelli offers or Dennis Reis offers.  Each one has a similar begining teaching you to properly interact with the horse and giving you some exercises to practice.  I'll be happy to give you some pointers along the way if you'd like to start an email dialogue.  There's more to it than achieveing the exercise- the learning is in the why and how of it.  there's a good book and DVD - but I'm not sure the place I got mine from still has it.  Check somewhere for a book and DVD pair by GaWaNi Ponyboy - called 'Horse, Follow Closely"  - Pony talks to you about the Native American and his relationship with the horse - he has some exercises as well at the back of the book and it's a very nice book.<br>  <br>  Any and all of these will start you down the right track.  I would suggest to you that you keep a goal in mind of being able to do everyting from the ground with this filly that you'd do on her back first.  Spend the first year going thru all the exercises you can find and take her everywhere afoot and encounter everything afoot that you might in your first rides.  this gives you the ability to build expectations on her, learn what types of things will be difficult and which will be easy for her.<br>  <br>  Above all, patience is key.  We humans are results oriented, we understand through many different mediums how to communicate - words, gestures, body language - even somethings we understand subconsciously.  the horse doesn't have a language other than body language and body space.  The horse must try to take the sounds we make, the movements of our body, our heart rate, breathing rate, etc to try to build a language and try to react in the way we expect.  it's an amazing thing when you think about it, their desire to understand and comply with our wishes if we will think of them as a horse not a human and start out with the right expectations.  As you progress with this horse, you're going to find certain difficulties.  These will like as not be due to limitations in yourself, not faults of the horse.  She won't understand completely what you request or she might not trust you enough to comply with your wishes.  At that time, I found some help in Buck Brannaman's books "Believe" and "The Faraway Horse" both are easy reads and found on Amazon and in stores like TSC for a low price.  these will help you also.  <br>  <br>  Finally - variety in learning methods a|`|wmVmNEBOaa	That's too bad about her swayback and being broke as a yearling. Don't expect her to stay sound for too long. She'll probably have a damn short riding career. I rode a lesson horse that had sway back and you have to put alot of extra padding under the saddle to fill the back (towels and such). You want to make her as comfortable as possible. Do lots of groundwork with her to get her trust before you even think about getting on her back. Good luck.|`|1Xy8KgFgaa	Best of luck to you with this one, well done for taking her on.  The best advice I can give is to spend loads of time with her, grooming, walking in hand, groundwork and the trust will come with time.  You can also ask for advice from your riding instructor and horsey people as everyone knows a wee bit about something!<br>  I hope it all works out for you.|`|tn4blcn9aa	I am glad you adopted the poor horse!  I have a horse with a swayback and he does great with a saddle.  it took me awhile to find a good pad but, I found that is works best for him to have a rubber pad on the bottom and a wool pad on top.  Hope this helps!  And good luck!|`|gOzlr6hEaa	Im sorry I don't have any tips for you but I think what you did was awesome. I hope you can give her a long and happy life. It sounds like you two will make an great pair. I hope every thing works out.|`|AA10711527	Its absolutely wonderful that you decided to take this horse in, as not many other people would want a 4 year old sway back.  That being said, I'm really not trying to discourage you, but have you REALLY looked around for anything else?  My point is that there are hundreds and hundreds of perfectly sound, sweet, trusting, and dead broke horses going to auction all the time because people just can't afford to feed them anymore.  A 4 year old that was ridden so young by such a big man may have serious problems with her back and joints in the not so distant future.  I just don't want to see your dreams of owning and riding away into the sunset on your first horse be more trouble and vet bill expenses than its worth, when there are soooooo many sweet and loving horses that might be better suited for you.  <br>  <br>  I bought a horse that was swaybacked years ago.  He was ridden by an obese man for many years, and my heart went out to him so I bought him.  He was the sweetest horse, I'll never find another personality like his, however, the trouble I went through to keep this horse comfortable was very time consuming and expensive, not to mention I couldn't ride him due to arthritis.  While they do make your hearts melt, just remember what you are getting into! :)  Ya never know, maybe your little girl will be completely comfortable all her life and be the greatest horse you'll ever own.  <br>  <br>  Start her with lots of ground work to gain her trust, show her that she has nothing to be afraid of around you.  Just spending spare time with her, brushing her, touching her, talking to her, can do wonders too :)  Good luck and I hope she turns out to be everything you imagined your first horse to be, but if not, remember that there are thousands more that need loving homes too! :)|`|nLmk1J7Xaa	It wonderful that you are taking on a rescue horse! But I doubt she will have a long riding career. You will need lots of padding to ride her. Use the Parelli 7 games to get her to trust you. I am doing that with my horse and my rescue pony! They are both coming along very nicely. To establish a bond with her, just spend time brushing and talking and singing to her. My horse and pony love to be sang to. Since she is only four years old, it will be hard to keep her on task. So, maybe get her Jolly Ball to play with her or something. She will get side-tracted very easily. But with love and care, she will turn out to be a great horse for you. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>     |`|RloOJ43haa	I wasn't aware that anything could help a swayback, but you say it's not bad ans she is sound enough to be ridden. <br>  <br>  Since you do have a special situation, I suggest that you get in touch with a local saddler for help in saddle fit. No point in making her back worse. <br>  <br>  Good for you for taking this one in.|`|GUEsVdaFaa	 Don't worry too much about her sway back... I had a mare who had a horrible sway back and she rode just fine for about 8 years after I got her (she was 14 when I got her). Maybe no high stress activities like jumping or racing but you shouldn't have too many problems. If you'd like to do your training yourself I'd recommend getting some materials from John Lyons or maybe Clinton Anderson. I've used Lyon's materials for years and they're great for starters... very thorough and easy to follow. I hope everything works out for you!!|`|1uR2zPnEaa	this  is just so sweet! my first horse was a rescue too!<br>  <br>  i just worked on ground work<br>  and building our bond and i cant ride him but hes still my best friend!|`|AA10776535	Ok this just put a knot in my stomach, i cant believe people sometimes, big man riding a yearling.  UGH<br>  Well i am happy you took this horse on, give her time to adjust to you and know your not the enemy.  I find sometimes just sitting down there in there corral works for me.  I have a new Azteca filly 1 1/2 years old that was just brought in to our rescue...freak of nature, beautiful but you would swear she came out of the wild.  This one is going to be a challenge for me, i spend everyday going to her and doing something in her corral or sitting there, basically ignoring her so she comes to me not the other way around.  I got a halter on her and can walk up to her, but the tension in her body language you can tell she hasn't been worked with or someone scared the crude out of her.  I have the farrier coming today to do her feet for the very first time, looks like she has never been trimmed.  Its an adventure but with patients they come around.  Walk around with her haltered and with a lead, let her check everything out and learn to feel safe with you.<br>   |`|jQvT6k7raa	Congrats!!<br>  <br>  Well, gel saddle pads work well for sway-backs. I would suggest just getting to know her inside and out, and when problems arise, deal with them then. I know this sounds obvious, but, don't just go it to it expecting issues. Stay calm and confident. Also, as soon as you think there something wrong, even the tiniest little limp, or any changes in behavior, ask someone about it. If you think you are just over acting to a sore leg, you aren't. With the swayback, lameness could be an issue. Another thing, rescues, and horses in general, but rescues most, need slow steady handling, leadership, and gentle methods. Avoid punishing her. Just reward and gently correct.<br>  I wish you the best of luck!

IMPvzBk1aa	First you have to define what NH is.  To me, it isn't about a particular trainer's methods, but about the phlosophy of training.  If a trainer works with the nature of the horse, and the mind of the horse, in order to get cooperation from the horse, he/she is practicing NH.  Every time a horse is forced into submission despite resistance, the philosophy of NH is being tested or violated.  NH is about how we work with horses to gain their trust and cooperation, versus methods that gain cooperation without the trust. Over time, the NH trained horse will remain mentally stable, where those trained with harsh devices and force will surely deteriorate or break down mentally.<br>  Every professed NH trainer out there has methods that are excellent, and can become a part of your training program.  I incorporate a variety that works for me, and for my horses.  The more methods you study, the bigger your bag of tricks.  We never stop learning, if we are smart.  For every way of training anything, there may be a better way...NH is based in having discovered most of those better ways, and all we need to do is be open minded and patient enough to try them.|`|RThxTnHZaa	I have read a lot baout natural horsemanship because it's very interesting and I want a special bond with my horse. i have dont natural horsemanship and it is suppose to wkro for every horse but for my horse it didn't YESI DID DO IT RIGHT!!!

There are parts of all the programs that work, but I always added my own twist to an idea I got from them.  I think Clinton Anderson is probably the most beleivable and so is GaWaNi  Pony boy, but as for the others, I take little pieces from every program and use them.  I like John Lyons round penning techniques and I like Parelli's ground work ideas, but I know that most of what they're selling is just good horsemanship with a "new twist".  I'ts been around forever, but most people overlook it because they don't have the time to invest in a horse.|`|aw6ypXTQaa	I think your view of not disregarding it is great as it's such a great thing. Parelli have a web site and so does monty Roberts. These are some leading NHS people and can offer great info on home study and courses and NHS in general. Hope this helps. x|`|Nuh3T1cDaa	Natural horsemanship has been around for centuries going back to the first book on horsemanship that we have written by Xonephone (this is probably misspelled)  Natural horsemanship always works because it teaches horses in the way horses can understand.  BUT......that does NOT mean that every "style" will work on every horse.  The natural horsemanship you see on RFD-TV or read in books isn't, IMHO, natural horsemanship but they are ways of teaching PEOPLE!  Every person learns a bit differently and for some people John Lyons works very well in teaching THEM.  Some people like other clinicians.  But, again in my opionion, you can't really learn to train by watching some tv program or going to a clinic.  Developing feel for your horse and getting your timing down takes lots and lots of practice.  You're not going to learn it in a few weeks or months or even years.  <br>  For example: Can you tell how much pressure you can put on your horse?  My Dakota can take a lot of pressure.  He has to be pushed hard before he really notices you. Then there's Ellie who can't stand being stared at.  That's too much pressure for her to handle.  Push her too hard and she'll fight.  For her you just have to think about maybe asking her and it's enough.  With Dakota, if you keep the pressure up once you've got him working for you he'd get dull and would never lighten up for you.  You can't learn this things except by doing them with someone who already can read a horse.<br>  I suggest that you may find some help with any of Mark Rashid's books or with Leslie Desmonds tapes or her book with Bill Dorrance, "True Horsemanship Through Feel".  Ray Hunt's "Think Harmony" is another good book.  But you really need some help from someone who already knows what they're doing.
aw6ypXTQaa	Saddle, stirrups, stirrup leathers, saddle pad (2), Girth, bridle (which will often come with reins but simple rubber reins work best), bit, neck strap, boots, travel boots, tail guard, summer rug, stable rug, light weight, heavy weight, fly rug, fly mask, fly spray, exercise sheet, first aid box, head collar, lead rope, body brush, dandy brush, hoof pick, comb, mane and tail de-tangler, sponges, sweat scrapper, body protector, helmet, reflective gear, crop, jodhpurs, gloves.  I can't think of much else you'll need. I hope this helps. Good luck. x|`|yhSX9RXVaa	Well if the horse is living out during the day and in at night you will only need a middle weight rug as it never gets that cold in britain. You may also need an indoor rug for the winter but that depends on the type of horse you get. With reins its just a matter of what you feel comfortable with. You will need brushes (Dandy, body, curry comb, comb etc.) A second hand saddle will do if you are not competing. Bridles are generally quite inexpensive so you could get a new one. You will have to get stirrup leathers in your length. I would advise that you get safety stirrup irons as getting your foot stuck when you fall of isn't very nice. The bit you get will depend on the horse but snaffle bits are always the best. You will also need a saddle cloth/numnah and a girth of appropriate size. That's about it. Oh and you will need a head collar and lead rope. Hope this helps. Good luck with your horse.|`|mVwxGg1caa	if you go through a few pages of questions in this section then i am 120% sure you will come across a identical question, will save you waiting for answers :)<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  xx|`|8mn2l3rCaa	saddle, saddle pad, bridle, halter, lead rope, brush...that's it|`|1d0931184fb6742d0b8431b7037a2a3baa	halter  &  good, heavy lead rope with a clip you can operate fast & easily, bridle (reins, headstall, bit), saddle & saddle pad, set of brushes ( rubber curry comb, hard brush, soft brush, mane & tail comb or brush), hoof pick, rags to wipe & clean. First aid kit. Bucket (rubber or heavy plastic). Saddle soap or conditioner.<br>  You use the term "rug" so I am thinking you are from the U.K. ? Reins depend upon the style of riding you will be doing... western or english. I actually like to use a set of roping type reins. They are 1 piece with clips at the bit end. If you are a beginner , you won't drop these like split reins, and they are easier to keep the same length. You can also ride with one hand or two. <br>  You might have a friend go with you to the tack shop & look around at equipment. Not everything has to be new. Hit up the tack swaps. |`|a9a67d339b01d91d50de293f9c0a0e8caa	Your question has been answered by others but i need to add (please dont be offended by this, i'm not being a *****, and i dont know your circumstances) but due to the fact your asking this question i dont think your ready to be a horse owner??  |`|B6zl0AJDaa	You mean tack, basically.<br>  <br>  And because you referred to a horse blanket as a "rug", I'm going to guess you're in the UK.<br>  <br>  First of all, you need a headcollar (Halter for us in the US).<br>  2.

A pair of brushing boots (We call 'em Splint boots).<br>  <br>  And of course a bucket for grain...<br>  |`|VmZKZjP1aa	Depends on what kind of riding. English, Western, in a round pen or up in the mountains/trail riding? If you go to a local horse shop, they can tell you all you need. Even if you don't buy from there (kind of expensive) you can get a good idea of what stuff is. I would order it online if you want to find good deals, or go to garage sales. <br>  <br>  Bare minimum: Bridle, bit, reins, saddle, saddle blanket/pad (or 2), cinch, halter, lead rope, curry comb, brush, hoof pick, <br>  <br>  You really want to make sure the saddle is one that fits you, but also fits your horse and doesn't pinch his back. If you do a search there are websites that can help you find the right saddle.<br>  <br>  And you want to make sure you wear good pants (jeans) and good shoes/boots<br>  <br>  If your doing any kind of mountain riding (steep hills) you might want a chest strap, rear cinch, etc.

qLkMSEBwaa	awwwwwwwww  Good luck with him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have owned several rats and all were female except this last one.  He's a biter.  But I think he was meant for snake food when he got lucky that I rescued him.  Make sure he has a cage big enough to enjoy and run around in.  As a baby...you need a small cage and within a month or 2 he will need a bigger one.  It will cost 30 for a med size...I actually had a $50.00 cage for my 2 girls...it had a top and a bottom half.  Just get him out a play as often as you can and hopefully he will tame easy.  The boy I have has me scared of him because he's so *%#@ mean!!!!!!!!  LOL  He's long as half my arm from tail to head and all he does is eat because we can't walk by his cage and he doesn't want treats....LOL  They will eat anything, but you don't want him to eat chocolate!!!!!!!!!!!!  When I change his cage, my son cracks up because I have to get my nerve up to grab his tail Which I would NEVER do if I wasn't so afraid of his mean bite....But it's the only way I can catch him without being bit...but I tell my son........this is the one time I wish I owned a snake!!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL  my son cracks up because he knows, I would NEVER kill him...but I would NEVER get another male either!!!!!!!!!  Just go online and do some yahoo search....the pet stores sells rat pellets and Wal-Mart sells corn cob bedding  it's great for the smell, I also buy the soft bedding and add on top of the corn cob so his feet doesn't hurt.  The corn cob helps to absorb the smell...............they also like these igloo looking shaped houses to hide in....I have a medium size one in Oscar's cage.  Rats loves sweets, fruits....so anytime you are eating fruit or a cookie, give him a piece....mine sits there waiting on us to give him something...LOL  I hate it that with all my rats, I could get them out and play with them....my first one would ride in the car with me on my shoulder and hide in my shirt when I went to the store...lol.  This one does not come out for 1 on 1 time because he even as a baby was too mean...I tried, but got tired of being bit.  So, I keep him fed, house clean and happy.  But kudos to you for letting your daughter have a pet rat...they make great pets!!!  It's just this one was too wild when I got him and could not be trained.  He's still loved or he would be GONE lol.  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|lwotfm70aa	i love ratz!  i personally think they make great pets.  but, they need a lot of love and attention.<br>  <br>  the one most important tip i can think of after having about 12 rats in 1's and 2's over the years - they love to chew things up.  like - sheets, material, clothes, cords, etc. etc.  they have to!  their teeth are always growing and they don't know any different.  you need to give him chew toys in his cage to grind his teeth.  <br>  <br>  if you let him out & misplace him...he may do this and you have to stop yourself from wanting to yell at and hurt him!  it is really your own fault if you leave things in his way.  i turned all of this into a positive - i save all of their 'autographs' as someday i want to write kids stories and these will all be part of my book/s idea/s.  i gave all of my rats too much freedom and i think it might have shortened their lifespan a little as they chewed up all kinds of my stuff.<br>  <br>  another point - positive reinforcement.  train him to come to you when you call him and give him a treat when he comes.  some people think that rice krispies make good treats for them.  this way, if he is out...he will come when you call his name.  because, if you yell at him & use his name at the same time, he will get afraid & not want to come when his name is called.  if mad, don't use his name in the same sentence...just tell him no real stern!<br>  <br>  i have always had girls, boys are sweeter from what i hear, but they get a little bigger and smell a little more.  so, a clean cage is a plus.  also, use the litter for cages that is just newsprint / paper.  it absorbs well...but rats have a tendency to have respiratory problems and the cedar, pine, wood litters are too strong of a smell for their respiratory system.  <br>  <br>  they love those little tissue boxes with that plastic thing removed as little houses in their cage & i would just turn it 1/4 each time i cleaned the cage so the tissue house stayed kind of clean too.  they will chew these up too.<br>  <br>  don't touch him after eating food or a happy meal or something, cause he might smell the food on your fingers and bite you thinking you are food...so, be careful...he would not mean to hurt you, but it does hurt a bit when they break skin (just squeeze it out & clean it immediately and you will be ok).  <br>  <br>  when giving him treats...try to give him low fat foods...not diet foods...but they do have a tendency to get fatty tumors...so, like humans, the healthier the food the better for his health and lifespan.<br>  <br>  all i can say is read up on tips on various sites to help you / your daughter to learn how to take care of rats.  have patience when training him.  give him lots of love.  the joy he will bring you in his lifetime will far outweigh their kind of short lifespan for such a cool creature!  <br>  <br>  well...i could go on forever.  i love rats and have my next two rats named after the orthopedic group who treated me after my accident - 'scoi' and my tibial plateau fracture - 'tibbie'.  these 2 rats are going to teach kids crosswalk awareness in my books someday.  i was hit by a car while walking in the crosswalk 1 1/2 years ago and have to have another surgery.  they were named during an mri when i was told to stay still and think about what makes me happy - animals!<br>  <br>  peace & enjoy your j.j!|`|I2zjRPS0aa	Play with the rat a lot, set up mazes and fun things to do together .They have a lot of energy that they like to spend walking around and having fun with owners.<br>  <br>  |`|boMKclPzaa	Here is a good site that might help you out. Best thing you can do is read read read!|`|REugdDwdaa	You can feed rats practically ANYTHING! Be careful when she takes him out of the cage she hold on to him, they are excellent jumpers (little acrobats) and once they get on the floor they can run like the wind. They can also stretch themselves, squeeze, and squish so they fit under doors and in small cracks. You really, really, really should get one more rat, because they are very sociable and just LOVE company. I have three rats and they cuddle with each other and keep each other warm, it's so cute. :)
Jp56X1RZaa	Hmm.....<br>  <br>  I only did jumping...|`|rGhPsn7Maa	they are all fun by my name you should tell what i luv to do. but if i were to pick out of those choices, well.......................wow that is hard! i see yer point, is there any way you can do all of them? if so you should otherwise i'd go with reining or cutting.|`|5TCewPYRaa	Well training for reining is pretty pricey...so unless  you know someone who trains reiners, or you have a lot of money, you might want to shy away from it...cutting is really fun! I did it for a summer and I had so much fun riding this big 16.1hh Old Fashioned QH named Oakie...amazing cutting horse :) anyways that what i would go with...ive never done working cow horse...it might be fun too...Im going with cutting tho! |`|4zsvYuB1aa	I'm an english rider myself. I haven't tried any of these sports, but I think Reining and Cutting would be the most fun. Next time you ride theses disciplines, try and rate how much you love it, how good you are, and how the rides tend to go. I would go with the sport that you are the best at and enjoy the most. I know it's a tough decision - good luck!|`|4Wgf6WZraa	I thought I would suggest another sport you could try with your Horse.<br>   Cowboy Mounted Shooting. It is a timed event in which you ride a course around Barrels and poles while shooting Balloons . It's a real rush . You get to dress up like a 1880s cowboy/girl. ride fast and shoot guns. What could be better than that?<br>   check out the video!|`|ejj2N3uaaa	If it were me, I'd choose reining simply because I've tried it and enjoyed it, even though I don't participate anymore (I competed in it through IHSA but none of my horses are reining horses).<br>  <br>  However, it is ultimately up to you. If you have to choose just one, think about which one you would enjoy most. If you like competition, which of the three allows for the most showing? Some areas offer more reining competitions; others are more cow-horse based. If you plan to work with a trainer, which of the three is most available? Do you already have a horse? What are his/her strengths? <br>  <br>  I am very competitive but I'm not very rich (ha). Like most of us, I can't afford to go buy a new horse every time I decide I want to try a new discipline. Fortunately, I've loved pretty much every discipline I've tried, so I usually end up riding/showing most frequently in the discipline that suits my horses the best. For one horse, that's jumpers. For my other horse, that's AQHA all-around...particularly Hunter Under Saddle. If you already have a horse and want to be competitive, that might be a good place to start--evaluate his strengths.<br>  <br>  If you like to show for fun but don't really care about how well you do, then forget your horse's (or your) natural talents and think about what you most enjoy. Which one excites you the most?<br>  <br>  Fortunately for you, these three sports are actually very similar and require similar training. There are plenty of horses (and riders) that excel in all three. You could take a lesson in each (or several lessons, depending on your time/budget) and see how it goes. Eventually, you might decide that you'd rather specialize in one. Or you might decide you want to strive for all three and there's nothing wrong with that. <br>  <br>  And remember, there is nothing wrong with showing in one sport for a year or two and then changing. As long as you are happy and your horse's well-being is taken care of, you should be able to do whatever sport you enjoy most.|`|zd0UaQ5Iaa	Do all of them! That's what I do, western pleasure, hunter/jumper, english pleasure, low level eventing, horsemanship, showmanship, and equitation! Plus the disciplines you choose above are relatively similar meaning you could get a horse and train for all three, but if I were to choose just one I would do reining since you can do so much with it and you can always improve on it. There's freestyle reining and just regular reining and etc. etc. Hope this helps!|`|11I5uSxCaa	 cutting: you have to be ready along with the horse in one second you will be on the horse, then the next you will be on the ground.  so unless your experienced, I wouldn't try it first, get some lessons with it.  reining has the same effect,  the sliding stop and the  one- foot pivot.   I say barrel racing, its nice and fun, but my advice get some gallop and barrel lessons before you try anything!!!, this will strengthen your legs.  |`|OqoTLaUmaa	Personally my favorite of those options is reining, but I haven't competed western in a while. Maybe you could throw some english style riding into the mix, maybe you'll find another type of riding you will want to stick with. I used to rein and barrel race but then I switched to hunter-jumper and had a blast, but whatever riding style you think is best for you.|`|UtjCxWgQaa	I think reining is great. Its fun, fun to watch, and your horse will get a kick out of it! Its also good because then he will get lots of work with leads, circles, spins, etc. After doing reining my horse was really light with her mouth and had just about perfected flying lead changes and spur stops. Its great(:|`|KR9jyXJ6aa	I like reining, since horses are required to have the proper dressage training before starting. Really, in an ideal world, every horse would have basic dressage training before starting the discipline they are going to do for the rest of their lives.|`|gaUvKebFaa	Barrel racing ;]]|`|ucQIOet7aa	reining or working cow horse
PZkaRXgJaa	yes i used to wake up terrified and i would sleep with my mom. my mom gave him away when i was young|`|xfnv0VFOaa	Through an awful lot of yelling at my poor little hamster I have somehow trained her to not run on the wheel when I first turn out the lights. She only runs on the wheel when I play music, watch t.v, when I'm not in the room, or if the lights have been out for a while. She used to make so much noise I couldn't sleep but she's a good little baby now... She used to chew on the bars and run on her wheel as fast as possible.|`|is0ON3lgaa	After five years and after having fifty hamsters and five gerbils I understand what you are saying!  Don't get me wrong though.  I love my small pets but they do get noisy.  It's their natural time to be active so you can't always prevent the noise.  <br>  You could try getting a silent wheel such as Wodent Wheel from Petsmart.  You can also take some vegetable or olive oil and put it on the wheel to help reduce the noise.|`|chI2ZquXaa	Yes, but you get used to it after a while. It helps to put olive or vegetable oil on the wheel (real oil could kill the hamster) and eliminate loud objects. If you have a hamster I suggest keeping him in a different romm than where you sleep.|`|lsrOvSYKaa	Well, I used to have 18 hamsters and 1 gerbil, all at one time. (2 of them had 16 babies and i rescued a gerbil.) It does get annoying, but you get used to it in no time. Just like you get used to the sound of railroad tracks or airplanes over head when you live near them. But in reality, it's not that bad with only 1 hamster. |`|BhtMMparaa	Yes, but here's a few tips to offset it.... a little.<br>  <br>  1.) oil his wheel (dismantle it and oil)<br>  2.) take his wheel out at night, but put it back in in the daytime<br>  3.) make sure his wheel does not touch the sides of the cage when it moves|`|1hRd6UVyaa	I used to have two dwarf hamsters, and they would get into little scuffles that involved lots of squeaking.<br>  <br>  Eventually, I just oiled the wheel and moved them to a different room.|`|S1y3TsHAaa	Well, Mine makes a little noise but not to loud............. You could try moving your hamster to another room or you could take her/his Wheel out.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!|`|yAOCSANOaa	Yes, at first when I had my hamster it made so much noise but then like after a few weeks it HELPED ME GO TO SLEEP!!!! I know crazy but its the truth.|`|dAbY7Droaa	no but mine is to fat to do any thing try yelling SHUT UP!! it always works |`|D4DD2LpWaa	Mines doesn't make no noise.|`|S4vI2KgRaa	ahahah yes its annoying|`|euaEVkH7aa	yes he is a *****.|`|8YvAUAuNaa	the wheel sound is loud.. u could move it to another room. or oil the wheel where it is attached, dont take the wheel out |`|5ccrvaLHaa	Mine made a lot of noise with his wheel... that was pretty much it though.
BMd0Dvj1aa	I used science diet on my dog I had that ''new and improved'' formula my dog got the same things! go to pet smart there you will find other types of organic food that won't make your puppy have gas and bad breath because that ones won't have too much fish oil.But science diet is a very low dog diet try to get anothar one get Canidae dog food is the best  option!<br>  <br>  hope I helped. =D|`|sWWR2R0Baa	If your not to picky about the price, try Evo puppy food. You can order online or sometimes petco and/or pet supplies plus will carry it.<br>  <br>  It's first 4 ingredients or so are actual meat...which is outstanding. Remember the less "fillers" like corn and wheat the better it is for your dog!|`|tlJTR01Paa	Finally!  I thought I was losing my mind.  My dog has worse gas than my husband and the odor from her kennel (just the smell from her body) when I come home just about knocks me over.<br>  <br>  I'll be switching maybe even before this bag is empty.|`|SZsN1IMjaa	I think Eagle pack has some holistic foods- I remember seeing some eagle pack holistic at the local pet store. Not necessarily organic, but it's definitely a bit better than Science Diet.|`|QXRrJPHqaa	Science diet is crap dog food, so I am not surprised by what youre saying.  You should get your dog on a different brand, usually stuff you buy at a feed store/pet store and not places like walmart is best.|`|Zywq5Qwraa	Its a bit on the pricey side but paul newman has a newmans own brand of pet food thats 100% organic.|`|AA10112346	This is the worst food you can feed. you'd be better off feeding out of the garbage cans.  Feed wellness, it is avaible at Petco now. Its more expensive than science diet but its healthier, no bad breath, and no smelly stool. or gas.<br>  A 6 pound bag is only like 17 dollars.  This lasts my beagle 2 weeks.. They have large breed, every stage, puppy, ect..|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Science Diet is a high priced low quality food. There are foods out there that are so much better...Canidae, Wellness, Solid Gold, Merrick, Innova, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, California Natural just to name a few.
o93EwErKaa	Malteses and Yorkies are both great little dogs.  In my experience, Malteses are more prone to becoming one person dogs and are not as good with children.  Grooming of a Maltese is a little harder, but both require daily brushing.  I prefer the Yorkies because they dry much faster after a bath and you don't have to constantly combat the tear stains and the dirty paws because of a Maltese's white coat.|`|NwYwLdsNaa	I have own both maltese and yorkies.  They are both good dogs.  The grooming was harder for me with the maltese.  I own a yorkie now.  :)|`|J1kJb98Maa	how old are you<br>  do you have a job or go to school<br>  an apartment or house<br>  fenced in yard<br>  etc<br>  you need to answer alot of questions before you can even think of getting a dog<br>  NEVER GET A PUPPY GET ADULT DOGS <br>  see already you sound to selfish to deserve a pet|`|RWTIPOfIaa	they are both awesome dogs. personally i like a maltese better. but what i am getting in July is a maltipoo. there is also a yorkiepoo|`|nFiTpDAeaa	In my opinion, yorkies stay just as cute as they age.<br>  <br>  Maltese, their eyes run and get tear stains and it gets worse with age. And white dogs coats tend to discolour as well.|`|uMyMHDPDaa	You should get a Yorkshire terrier (yorkie) because it is very cute and doesn't get tear stains like the maltese.
o93EwErKaa	A vaccinated dog can still get parvo, but if your other dogs are healthy with no diarrhea, poor appetite, etc. than most likely your puppy contracted the virus elsewhere.  Parvo is something that can live on surfaces for a long time and you can even bring it home on your shoes or clothing after visiting an infected spot like Petsmart or a dog park or just walking down the block where the virus was shed in another dog's poo.|`|PNLNewgQaa	what do you think parvo prevention shot or the 7in1 shot is?  they are to prevent parvo to getting to them. But sad but true,  yes a dog that had the shot can still catch it later on from another dog if it's severe enough but unlikely to catch it at all.  and most dogs if they have the shot then they catch parvo then the shot was no good or something was wrong with it, like one of these cheapies you get from somewhere like other then the vets or somekind of clinical place for animals. if your puppy hasn't had the vaccine yet then it's either too young or you can't afford it, so therefore call your local vet office and ask them what to do? Instead of going in to make a visit unless they say it's absolutely necessary.   Do you absolutely know what parvo is? because puppies can have the same symptoms what you think are symptoms but really are them just learning how to be a dog like there natural instinct. In conclusion Can you puppy catch parvo, Yes it can, If it is younger then 6 weeks then take it to a vet. If it is oder but under a year then go get it vaccinated. theyre really not supposed to have a vaccine after 6 month old.     CALL YOU LOCAL VET TO ASK THEM ALL THESE QUESTIONS!   THESE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU!|`|30eSQJE0aa	It doesn't matter if the other dogs are vaccinated, what matters is your own puppy's immunity.  Parvo is a very tiny, very contagious virus that can survive on inanimate surfaces for a year or more.  This means that you could have parvo on your shoes or carpet right now, or a dog that has immunity could still carry the virus on its coat, paws, bedding, etc.  The only way to fully protect from parvo is to get the puppy all of his vaccinations on time, as scheduled by a vet, when he is still young.  Then stay on track with boosters.  <br>  <br>  There is some question about whether a young puppy can be fully protected, due to the possible gap between when the mother's immunity given to the puppy at birth wears off and the time when a vaccination is given.  However, once your dog is about 8 months to a year old and has all his shots, you should be confident that he will not get parvo.|`|WvI1u8EBaa	No,but it can be caught if you have had a dog in the yard with parvo,it will stay in the ground or where ever another animal has had it.
kRO55DHyaa	There are rescues everywhere that can help you.  I wouldn't expect you to post your location online, but if you'd like to e-mail me with the dogs' breeds (or guesses on breeds if they are mixed), I will be happy to compile a list of resources for you to try.  Click my profile and click on the e-mail link to send it if you wish.  I understand your situation-I am constantly having to turn away more animals from friends, family, and coworkers. I just can't take on more than I currently have long-term.  I do short-term fostering, but that's all I can handle right now.|`|AA11244754	Try finding a no-kill shelter or humane society in your area, you can usually call them to relinquish a dog.|`|oaJcgz3uaa	Try to find a no-kill animal shelter if there are any in your area.  You might also try posting ads at your local dog park.|`|f8ro0Mdaaa	did you try craigslist.org becuase trust me when we had to get rid of our dog he got a new home in one day.
NkEHCHsOaa	I've seen some stay gray, but I think some turn more into a tan out of gray. It would be nice to hear from someone who's seen a puppy go through that stage of coloration to adulthood. <br>  <br>  I like the gray myself, but then I'm not a nazi showing is all dogs were meant for type freak.|`|o93EwErKaa	Most likely she will turn a light golden blonde.
AA10341615	yup, all the answers r rite on (repetition)...It takes alot of patience and constanly repeating the same word over and over again, but not for like more than 10 mintues at a time.  Babies r acutally really good for teaching to talk, once they learn a word, they will remember it and say it for life.  Just try to let him/her learn one word a time.  Dont confuse him with trying to learn many words at once.  It's not gotta be right away for him to talk, a few minutes a few tiems a day and eventually, he'll surprise you.  And one more thing....when you r teaching your cockatoo a new word, try to get really close to him, (on your finger or shoulder for example) and mkae sure he/she can see your lips as your saying the word.  Birds are very intelligent creatues, so with some time and patience, those words will be coming out in pharses and as clear as day!|`|P9SVhFdsaa	Spend lots of time with him.  Talk to him constantly, explain what you are doing.  When offering treats use the word(s) you want him to say "Want nut?" "Bedtime".  They will eventually say only the words they like.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately there is no way to guarantee talking, birds do what birds want to do.|`|d10tsOELaa	get a voice recorder and play the word like 100 times so it is the same tone of voice_______________worked for me|`|K2TqDCEsaa	say someon word alot of times the he will repeat u|`|A9j7ahwsaa	repetition and reward, just say a word and reward him with food treats or affection

Screw the SOB|`|qEOJzbJraa	You are asking for bricks to be thrown at you, aren't you ?    I think he was overrated before all of this happened. I just never liked him or cared for him and when he was found guilty of fighting dogs, I hated his *** even more.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	No, he is a cruel person, and it just shows, maybe YOU like him, because maybe YOU fight dogs to!    Yes, I am glad they put him in jail, but I wish it was for forever.|`|szsSPSmPaa	They can keep that idiot in a dog pen for 50 years as far as I'm concerned.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	Are you posting this question to piss people off because you are going to get some nasty answers and I hope you do. They should have tortured him and made him fight against his will. Screw Michael Vick|`|vOlMa6wqaa	JUST DOGS?????? DID YOU SEE WHAT HE PUT THOSE DOGS THROUGH!!!!!!! HE SHOULD BE IN JAIL FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED!!!!! SCREW THAT SOB!!!!!|`|s84kP2Fiaa	Any decent person wishes he would stay in much longer. Being cruel to any animal is sociopathic, if not psychopathic. He is asking to be allowed back in to play football and I pray he IS NOT allowed, that would send a horrible message to young people that what he did is 'O.K'.         IT ISN'T! This man has no heart, he is narcissistic and is just plain mean and evil. He doesn't know what 'human decency' means. If you think like him, I'd suggest getting therapy for yourself.
5dDNqwlzaa	Well you're dog is still a puppy and he's slowly growing out of it.  Sometimes it takes dogs a little longer to mature.  I would suggest:    Every time he gets a little mouthy, get up and say "NO" in a strong, but not yelling voice.  Then get one of his toys and give it to him or throw it so he gets that if he wants to play, he plays with the toy, not your hands.  If he doesn't want to play with the toy, and again goes for your hands, say "No" again, and get up and ignore him, he'll eventually get the picture.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I corrected every instance of play biting.    If a firm "No" & redirecting the pup to something it could have failed to correct the behaviour, then it the next step would be a stronger correction & ignore the pup.     Once the pup settled & interacted without mouthing it would be praised.|`|UgvLTFmSaa	Well if he's doing that to other dogs he's just playing but is also probably a more dominate puppy. Because he's not afraid. |But that's not a bad thing but it could be later on. Did you get him fixed?  That tends to help on that.|`|JsBb732Maa	It's ok with the other dogs because they are playing, but with people he needs to be trained out if it. If he mouths at people take his lip and pinch it against his teeth and tell him no bite. That will stop him putting his teeth on people, even if he's playing it's not a good behavior.|`|AA12130640	when you mean mouth do you mean nibbling or chewing. because my dog always nibbles on my other dog and he doesnt seem to mind it.
FNYEkyqLaa	Why don't you start with training your dog in all the basic commands first?  Oh you don't know how to do that?  How about enrolling yourself and the dog in a good basic obedience class?  It will give you the skills to teach further commands such as, the "quiet" command.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	When he barks, squirt him with a water bottle filled with water and say "shhh" firmly with your finger to your mouth in the quiet sign. Pause for a second. If he doesn't bark, say,"YES!" and reward him with a treat and a pat. Over time, you can lengthen the time you ask him to be quiet. Don't go too far too quickly, though! Add a second or two every other day or so.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I have 9 dogs and one is a 14 year old long hair Chi I rescued when he was 8 years old.  He barks everytime someone comes in the door.  Doesn't matter who it is.  It can be me, my husband etc.  He just barks.  And he barks at everything else.  It has gotten worse as he has aged.<br>  <br>  So, here is what I am suggesting.  Stop it now.  It will not go away and it will not become easier.  If you need to get the help of a professional trainer, do it.  Barkbusters.com is a good one to consider.<br>  <br>  I love him despite he drives me crazy.  (The spray bottle doesn't work.  Neither does shaking a can with coins etc. I don't push it.  He is getting old.)
gTXUcd1maa	I absolutely love pugs!!!! I've researched them a lot, and here's some questions I think would be suitable.<br>  <br>   1. Are the parents pure bred? ( even if it doesn't matter to you, it's good to know)<br>  <br>  2. Do the parents have any health issues ( other than normal pug related issues,  due  to just the way pugs are built.) that could be passed on to your puppy?<br>  <br>  3. What are their personality traits?<br>  <br>  4. Is he/she AKC registered?<br>  <br>    Hope this helps!|`|Y5FyAekkaa	When it comes to pugs your first concern is going to be their breathing. Ask if the parents have ever had any breathing concerns. Some require surgery to expand their trachea.  If this is the case then it can be a hereditary issue and I wouldn't buy. Also ask about vaccines. If the puppies are at least six weeks have they had their first shots and deworming? What about mom and dad are they current? She should be willing to provide the name of her vet as a reference.<br>  <br>  Also another item that is overlooked is the general temperament of the puppy. Does it let you roll him on his back? Touch his feet? His tail? If yes, then he likely won't have any aggression issues. <br>  <br>  If you are paying for a dog, ask about AKC papers. Are the parents registered? How soon can she give you the papers to register yours?<br>  <br>  Even if you aren't planning on registering, this is a staple of responsible breeding. You are paying for quality.|`|1C9wyrvxaa	First, it would be best if the parents are there where you can observe them. Are they timid? Aggressive? Sickly? Or are they friendly, approachable and healthy looking? <br>  <br>  Here is a website that lists the 10 questions you should ask before purchasing your new puppy. <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=302" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  I just want to add that I have a one year old black Pug and she is the light of our life! She is stubborn and will-full and has been a challenge to train properly. Housebreaking was a real issue with her, as was the chewing. BUT she is a crazy little clown who is always full of antics and is constantly making us laugh. She has more energy than I could ever have imagined!  She is also THE most loving dog I have ever owned, always ready with kisses and warm snuggles.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new baby.. there isn't many things cuter than a baby pug!|`|3EaFjsA8aa	Please check out this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_information/how_to_find_a_good_dog_breeder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...</a><br>  <br>  It will help you identify if the breeder you going to go see is an actual breeder doing it for the love of the breed or someone looking to make money.<br>  <br>  Also, did you know that if you went to www.petfinder.com or www.1-800-save-a-pet.com you could probably find a pure breed pug and even puppies who have all their vet care done for under $300.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	One question you should definately ask is if red mainge has been a problem with his dogs. red mainge is hereditary in pugs especially and they are very prone to having it.|`|AA11776611	-- What are the congenital defects in this breed? The breeder who says "none" or "I don't know" is to be avoided. That's a person who's not screening for what she doesn't know about, and you don't want to pay the price for her ignorance. <br>  <br>  <br>  A good breeder tells you every remotely possible problem in the breed, from droopy eyelids to deafness to epilepsy. <br>  <br>  <br>  -- What steps have you taken to decrease defects in your dogs? You want to hear words like "screened" and "tested" and "certified." <br>  <br>  <br>  In breeds with the potential for hip dysplasia - that's almost every large breed (not your Pug) -- look for PennHIP or Orthopedic Foundation for Animals certification. These are expert, unbiased evaluators who know exactly what to look for. Insist on documentation on both parents. And their parents, too. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -- Do you have the parents on site? May I see them? This is a bit of a trick question. You should always be able to see the mother -- unless she died giving birth -- but reputable breeders often don't have the father on hand. That's because the best match for any particular dog may be owned by another breeder, and the female was sent away for breeding. <br>  <br>  <br>  As for the mother, she may be a little anxious with strangers around her puppies, but on her own you want to see a well-socialized, calm and well-mannered dog. So, too, should be the rest of the breeder's dogs. If you don't like the temperaments of a breeder's grown dogs, what makes you think you'll get a good temperament in one of the puppies? <br>  <br>  <br>  -- What are the good and bad points of the parents, and what titles do they have? You may be looking for a pet-quality purebred, but you still want to buy from someone who knows what top-quality examples of the breed are -- and uses such animals in a breeding program. You want to see show and working titles all over that pedigree. <br>  <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you go home and throw that fine pedigree in a drawer. Recent titles on both sides of a pedigree are the sign of a breeder who's making a good-faith effort to produce healthy dogs who conform to the breed standard. <br>  <br>  <br>  -- Where were these puppies raised? How have you socialized them? "In the house" is the best answer to the first question. You want a puppy who knows what the dishwasher sounds like, whom you don't have to peel off the ceiling when a pan drops, who has set a paw on linoleum, carpet and tile. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Environmental socialization is important, but so, too, is the intentional kind. The best breeders make sure puppies have been handled by adults of both genders and by children. <br>  <br>  <br>  -- What guarantees do you provide? You want to see a contract explaining the breeder's responsibilities should the puppy develop a congenital ailment. In most cases, such contracts state either replacement with a new puppy or refunding of your purchase price.
oBlGiHlpaa	What do you want to train him to do? I have two ferrets and we used the clicker you get from a pet store (mainly for dogs) and treats (my ferrets like the chicken kind).|`|bepZupAfaa	that depends on what you to train him to do.    i have 4 ferrets that come to a squeaky toy when it is squeaked. my 5th ferret is deaf so i have to get her attention another way. i trained my others to come to the squeaky toy when it was time to get back in their cage.when they come to the cage i give them treats to let them know that they did the right thing. also tell them what good boys and girls they are.  the little deaf ferret (Bubbles) i usually get her attention and if she comes i still praise her even though she doesn't hear me.    can you be a little more specific on what you want to train him to do?  then maybe i can help you out more    good luck

He's filthy!|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Not to me so much.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	I don't think so.<br>  <br>  I think he needs a bath and to be groomed. For goodness sakes can that poor pup see?? Do you clip his nails or give him baths? He looks so dirty.<br>  <br>  Just an ugly dog with that hygiene.|`|4XXa7wBxaa	Aww! He's so cute!
NkEHCHsOaa	I think so. They can't ever get even, but I don't think he will ever do it again.|`|PdaiyUkDaa	noooo castrate him|`|CJMhtM7maa	No,he should get more time.He should not play for the NFL for a couple of years at least.Don't forget he is still facing state charges, and hopefully does time on those charges.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Thanks for the lecture - here's my answer.<br>  <br>   Never.<br>  <br>   He can go get another position on a team, and I and others will always make sure the NFL knows this is not a good business move.<br>  It isn't a matter of someone having 'done their time' - he has not been apologetic, and no amount of work in animal rescue could ever make up for what he put those dogs through. A terrible thing?  Try a LOT of them.<br>  <br>    The NFL is a money machine that puts athletes up as role models for kids, and that needs to be stewarded a lot better than it is.  Michael Vick should have been publicly ostracized and banned from the game, but instead people are just waiting to see if he can still play.<br>  <br>    I don't understand what has happened to part of the human race when this amount of money can be paid to someone who has done such horrific acts.  It's inexcusable, and not to be left unchallenged.<br>  <br>    Dangerous territory is exactly where he should be headed, and anyone else cheering for him, or collecting money because someone still is.<br>  <br>    I am not married to my dogs, but I have friends who are cruelty investigators.  Human decency dictates that anyone should be outraged, including you.  And God help whomever he plays for.|`|XavY3fiWaa	I watched animal witness the michael vick case and i thought he didn't get enough time in jail, but he did pay million of dollars in fines and for the care of his dogs when they were in shelters But i still think he should have a lot longer in jail.  And no i don't think he deserves to come back so hopefully they will be smart enough not to let him play football again.  Oh and do you even care cuz it kind of sounds like you don't.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	No! No! No! and H*&L No!  He should not be looked up to as a celebrity and a childs icon.  Had this be you or I or your next door neighbor if we did this crime got out of prison 20 years later not 2 years later.  Our jobs would not be there waiting for us.  No one in town would feel we've did our time.  Why should he?  He is a disgrace to the NFL.  He wanted his 2 min of fame and he got it.  Now the little cry baby is not happy with the type of fame.  I say suck it up.  You do this type of crime you best be prepared for the consequences.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I completely agree with hey Huh??  on this one.  He should be banned from the NFL and any smart manager knows this.  There is no way he should be put in a position where kids (or anybody for that matter) should be looking up to him as a role model.  It makes me sick to think that that is what will happen.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Personally I hope that Mr Vick contracts Syphilis in the penn :)<br>  But that's just my 2 cents on that :)|`|Zq6Z3IUnaa	Here is my opinion:  You do the crime you pay the time.  That should be for everyone""|`|EJqsqnZFaa	Honestly, I think that they have done all they can do to that monster and he is too stupid to learn his lesson. They are not going to make him see what a horrible thing he has done, but hopefully they have scared some of the other low-lives that fight dogs. I personally will not support any team that he plays for and would hope that other educated people with a heart would follow suite. <br>  People like him will never learn until the rest of us openly oppose their actions and the average person is too weak to speak up for the innocent. That is the same reason child abuse is able to continue. Every women, child and animal that is abused deserves for someone speak up for them and SOMEBODY sees the abuse happening but says nothing, that is the trend that needs to end.
JtPu0KBXaa	Cook it before you eat it!|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Keep in the fridge unless you are going to start a colony and breed your own. Even then you will need to get as many of the dead ones out as possible. Transfer what you have left to a container big enough to put in some ground oats. If you want them to breed, do this and toss in a couple of potatoes cut up for some moisture and just let them go. Before long you will have lots of little babies. If you end up with lots more than you want check with small pet stores as they may buy them off of you or take them from you in trade.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	yeah they are def dead and rotting. next time try sifting out some of that bedding they come with and put oatmeal in there instead. they will eat off this and last longer, especially if you have them in a warmer fridge.|`|zTeLhroWaa	I keep mine in a breeding container...as I have my own colony, but the same ideas apply.  Go through it once and a while and remove the dead rotting bugs.  They're making the other mealies less nutritious for your pets.|`|a3FAGYgVaa	Wait... you're not keeping them in the fridge? Keeping them in the fridge allows them to slow down their development process. Also, make sure they have something to eat.. a piece of potato will do the trick.|`|o66jqnraaa	that is normal if you have them for a while you should only get 500 at a time then they won't stink as much.|`|RkK673VHaa	they smell if there is too much moisture in the tub there in
GxV4jGKMaa	I have a pit mix also.  He's teething.  Give him toys that he's allowed to chew on.  Don't ever tolerate any kind of nips.  A playful bite from any other dog might be fine, but with this kind of dog, it's never O.K.  You don't need to hit him, just make a loud noise, and separate yourself from him.  Let him know that the playing stops when he bites.  He'll figure it out.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	My dog is a pit mix, they get in those moods when they have pent up energy. You should get him to take up fetch. I run my dog till he's out of breath then he's so relaxed. Also give him mini dingo's my dog loves to chew on those|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Buy him some really hard rawhide chews.  He will play for hours & bury them around the home, when he wants to nibble he will go & dig them up.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	you MUST make the time to direct him to what he can and cant have. You need to be the leader of the pack! If he trys to bite or nip at you tell him firmy "no" or the sound "chh" as the dog whisperer does. You must give him a firm touch on the neck sholdier area (dont hurt him though) showing that you are the boss. When he is summisive and calm and isnt showing attention to the object he was chewing then you put that away and set a chew toy he can have in front of him. Then tell him "ok" giving him permission to chew it.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	He's bored. <br>  <br>  When he goes into chewing mode he's had it with being cooped up and needs to do something and what's closest are all those things you mention. What's better is take him outside for playtime or a run off leash.<br>  <br>  Stop the nips ASAP!  This is unacceptable behavior.<br>  <br>  Put a lead on him when he's with you. If he even looks like he's going to nip.  Tell him ' No Bite!' Snap the lead & instantly release. This is not a pull. It's an instant snap and realease. AFTER the command.<br>  We give dogs a split second to obey. LOL!<br>  <br>  Remember command first, instant snap, instant release.  <br>  When he stops tell him good.......no bite,  good.....name, good no bite!<br>  We repeat the command with a 'good' so he'll know why he was admonished and why he was good.<br>  <br>  He'll shape right up with more exercise.  <br>  <br>  Do a little research. <br>  <br>  Write down all the hours that he's inside. Then the minutes that he's outside.   You'll be surprised at how long he's stuck looking at four walls.<br>  Increase the outside minutes to 1/2 hr or more twice a day.
16XpYCBmaa	They will act the same except they may become more attached to you, and they will get larger nipples filled with milk, they will gain some weight but maybe not much since they are small.

They will have tempter tested the dog before you get him so you know how he or she will behave and you will be helping that rescue go find another one forgotten in a shelter.  You will have to pay for the dog but it shouldn't be as much.<br>  Also maybe you should go to a rescue that houses dogs that have been tested (I'm a big belierer in this) and see who they think is good for you.  You get to spend a little time with the dog and see if you match up.<br>  You might even be able to bring the new guy home for a long weekend to make sure you match up and if you don't sending him back won't hurt has much since you know he's still safe.<br>  Have fun looking at dogs :0)<br>  Kath|`|Hwybmzg5aa	the only other dogs you can get would be chinese crested,Miniature poodle or toy poodle.

w1lh1INHaa	Depends on what you mean by "disease."<br>  <br>  Rabies, no.  Ear mites yes.  Lice, no. If the mouse has ingested poison, yes, that will affect the cat and likely kill it if not caught or treated in time.  If the mouse has parasites, the cat can get those too (ringworm is the most common, tapeworms also).  Fleas, yes.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	i would agree|`|tlbTwn9faa	Yes, i actually heard about this certain thing a mouse can have that causes it to go after cats so it will be eaten because it resides in the mouse brain.  I forgot what it was called but i know its true.|`|nFTyOWMCaa	It really depends on what kind of disease the mouse has.|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	If you mean worms like ringworm or tapeworm then yes.

enC9TvxUaa	-GREAT name, and cute dog!  Will probably be around 90-100# or so.  What type of pit bull do you have- this is not an actual breed, but a broad range of breeds under the pit bull umbrella. Hope your training him on who's boss NOW.|`|PdaiyUkDaa	wont get alot  bigger maybe 15 lbs more   pitbulls are a good dog very loving goofy loyal and believe or not they love people i have  one and taz is a great pet|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	The answer I've always been told on this is if you know what the puppy weighted at 3 months.  X's that by 3 and that's the weight. I swear it's been within a couple of pounds for each of my dogs I had that young.<br>  Just to comment pit bulls are not dangerous dogs, the owners of these dogs can make them dangerous.<br>  Pitbulls are made from different breeds and not clearly defined so to say they are dangerous is saying a lot of dogs are.  I've had many and they are sweet as buttons with a horrible rap.  Dob's used to have this rap, than rottweilers, now pittbulls.<br>  I hope you enjoy your wonderful dog and keep her happy and safe.<br>  Kath|`|ZPYZQxjkaa	Do you realize that these dogs are considered dangerous by definition (the law). I hope he stays small and nice but I can't figure out why anyone would wnt a dog that would turn on you in a flash.. More people are killed by pit bulls than other dog.|`|AA11112412	my pit was about that size at the same age. she now weighs about 65 lbs. that's not to say yours won't get bigger though. by the way i like his name i have a 3 yr old bull terrier named tank|`|uQfk8p7Laa	it depends on his father most male pitbulls can be around 90lbs to 100 and some can even weight more it just depends really! i am going to guess around 95lbs he might even reach 100lbs you never know!  he looks good though!|`|Ji8nA6ynaa	I will say about 90 pounds. He is very nice. What bloodline?
o93EwErKaa	It could also be pancreatitis.  Did the vet do any bloodwork?  Here is a link to pancreatitis - tender abdomen, hunched up posture, depressed, poor appetite, vomiting.  Did you feed tablescraps?  Something high in fat like roastbeef can sometimes trigger an attack.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1580&aid=335" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a>|`|u8u0exDtaa	Yes. This could all be back related but if she is in that much pain you need to take her to an emergency care center for animals. This is a very serious problems and anything back related with chihauhuas and other small dogs is serious. This could also be a problem with her hips or ribs. You just need to take her to an emergency vet center as soon as possible.|`|df6U3mxqaa	my mom spent $800 getting her dog looked at by the vet for the same symptoms and it was a back injury. and stop pressing on your babies legs and tummy if it makes her cry. ( that was a scolding) just make her as comfy as possible. and watch her. go around the house did she get into anything? glue, chicken bones, tinsel from the christmas tree, those can get lodged in her poop chute and cause terrible pain. is she going poopy like normal?  I dont really know just I hope your baby gets all better. ( I also have a chihuahua mix) Best of luck|`|my6AKy6Eaa	The vet should have been able to help you more than we can.<br>  I would say take her to another vet for a second opinion. <br>  It just doesn't sound like "back pain" <br>  She could be pregnant or could have stomach problems.<br>  Please take her to another vet.
3EaFjsA8aa	The cone is to prevent the dog from licking at the incision.  If she isn't doing that there is no need for the cone.  Most of the dogs I get fixed (around 100 plus a year) never need a cone.<br>  <br>  If you take the cone off and you notice she is licking her stitches a lot or biting at them then you will need to put it back on.  Since it has been a week I am sure there is nothing to worry about.|`|u8u0exDtaa	I would say yes but you would be able to keep close eyes on her all the time until you see that the stitch has fallen out if she re-opens the wound she can cause herself an infection.|`|PdaiyUkDaa	yes you can   just keep an eye on her|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Yes, at my clinic we only send home cones with dogs that are chronic lickers.  You can atleast take it off when you're home and able to supervise her.  I would put it on if you're going to work or are going gone for long periods of time.  But, if you're around and can closely supervise her she doesn't need to have it on.  Best wishes!|`|AA11244754	One of the reasons the cone collar is on it to make sure that she's not going to chew at the stitches or lick at the surgery site more than anything else.  You should direct this question to the vet since he's the one that put it on her.|`|J5hsCONRaa	Yep - if you feel she has no interest in the wound/stitches, it can come off. Just keep an eye on her.|`|ypBAdcHVaa	Best bet is to keep it on for another week, she is healed on the outside but not internally. It usually takes about 2 full weeks for her to have healed. A spay is a major abdominal surgery and it is best to just keep her safe. She can handle the cone for another week it will be by before you know it.
p3vjvzRPaa	Having just read the question about Fru Fru the maltipoo with papers, at first I thought you were kidding.  <br>  <br>  But, then I looked at your other questions/answers and no, you're for real.<br>  <br>  Sigh.<br>  <br>  Please please please take her to the vet and have her spayed.  Otherwise you're going to have a lot of headaches over the next few weeks (and even years if people who get pups from you have any problems with them).|`|o93EwErKaa	The chances are she is indeed pregnant with one tie.  I have never heard of a tie lasting more than 30 minutes so there might be something wrong.  It is important that you keep the male and female calm so neither is injured by being dragged around.|`|PM23RDycaa	When the knot shrinks back down and they come apart. Separate your animals and keep them that way. She's not on her PERIOD she is in heat. If you are going to own n adult you the proper terms. Call your vet and make an appointment to have her spayed, ASAP as you caught her mating.<br>  <br>  Mating does not 100% gaurantee pups.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Just leave them- you couldn't pull them apart now if you wanted to.  She may or may not be pregnant.  Dogs don't have periods, they go into heat, which is the opposite of a period.  It's the only time they CAN get pregnant.|`|bJh1MesQaa	That really sounds gross. That is why you spay and neuter. Don't buy, sell, or breed while homeless pets are still in need.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	They should be seperating soon.  Just leave them be.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	Yes she is more than likely pregnant. why in the world if you know nothing about breeding dogs are you letting your dogs do this? why not have them spayed or neutered? you obviously dont know what you are doing and i feel very sorry for the litter you are about to have. You cant just keep your dogs unspayed and expect nothing to happen. And then seek help for carrying for the dogs.
nPuZVGFRaa	I put all my dogs toys in the washer and dryer.<br>  It doesn't seem to matter.<br>  But sometimes the stuffing all gets pushed to one side and you have to even it out my messing with the toy a little.|`|ox5GMwEEaa	i put my dogs in the washer and it seems to be fine..even in the dryer|`|edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	You can just toss them in the washing machine.  You can use the gentle cycle if you wish but I don't think you have to because they are pretty sturdy.  I imagine all the water will be squeezed out of the squeakers after the dog chews on them a few times.  I would toss them in the dryer too.|`|umYvT7Mqaa	you can wash them like normal (in a machine) I would put them on the "gentle" cycle. Then put them in the dryer on low heat|`|wdaoaa1gaa	the same way you'd wash any other plush toys/stuffed animals... cold water in the washer.. hang dry it.  Also, you might want to use fragrance free detergent or something gentle since your dog will be chewing it..|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	I toss my dogs' toys in the wash (I use hot water for this wash as their toys are always grimy). I then air-dry them.
476e4d0658d635ac13fff50369c427c5aa	get him fixed if you plan to. he maybe sexual frustration if he wasnt done anything|`|t1zhVVfBaa	Its Rabbid Put it Down|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Has he been neutered?  It could be a dominance thing.  I assume you have separated the two dogs so you don't end up with unwanted puppies.
EwYYA6c2aa	Oh yes, they're great family dogs! All puppies go through a teething stage, so they do chew some things. Rawhide bones help. Also you can buy a spray called Bitter Apple and spray it on things you do not want chewed, it's at local pet stores. Generally, they do not bark unless they feel threatened. And most dogs do like to swim! :) They are GREAT with kids! I recommend this breed!|`|yLwKWzIUaa	they can be great family dogs. but, like any dog, they need training and socialization.<br>  they also need a lot of exercise, so make sure you have at least 1 hour a day to devote to walking.<br>  do they chew: any dog will if you let them, or if they're bored (this brings us back to the exercise factor: a tired dog=happy dog=happy owner)<br>  bark: again, if you let them<br>  like to swim: they're retrievers so yep :) ... usually. there are always some who don't like it (my dog is a lab x but hates water lol)<br>  good with kids: sure :)   with proper exercise & training, but that's the case with every dog.<br>  when you're choosing a puppy though, don't choose the hyperactive one, or the one who's always pining the other puppies to the ground, or the puppy who's nervous or really shy.<br>  the balanced puppy should grow up to be a nice family dog :)<br>  good luck :)<br>  <br>  <br>  ps: go to a responsible breeder
kWwgWSSgaa	First has your dog been referred to a canine oncologist for a specialist assessment? If not it would be worth considering or obtaining a second opinion.<br>  <br>  As amputation is still *may* & not *definite* others factors would need to be considered. How healthy is the dog generally? While seven years old is a senior, it doesn't rule out surgery & a good recovery.<br>  <br>  That said surgery isn't always the best option for a dog. It depends if the cancer is aggressive, how far it has spread, if it can be removed with clear margins & chemotherapy {if necessary}.<br>  <br>  My male Dobermann had a huge aggressive tumour on his shoulder & one on his flank. Amputation was mentioned as a possible option, but when the major surgery was carried out, it wasn't found to be necessary. After four sessions of carboplatin {chemotherapy} which he sailed through, he went on to make a full recovery & lived life to the full.<br>  <br>  Whatever choice you make for your dog, best wishes & good luck.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	I am sorry to hear this.  I know this is a hard time, but there are no easy answers.  There are things you need to know to make an informed decision.  It is time for you to do some research and ask your vet questions.  You need to know exactly what your dog has.  Is the cancer benign or malignant?  Fast or slow growing?  Is there any sign of metastasis?  If yes, where?  Exactly how extensive is the surgery going to be?  Will this remove all the known cancer?  Will there be chemotherapy or radiotherapy needed later?  Will removing the leg buy 1 month's time or 1 year or 10 years?  Should you be taking him to a cancer specialist?  All the things you need to ask before you would start treatment you need to ask before you start his.  You have my best wishes....|`|gwUMipsUaa	What breed is he?  Some dogs do just fine without a leg, but here they are removing a pelvis as well.  <br>  <br>  What would his quality of life be like after the surgery?  7 years old is a senior dog, so they won't recover like a 1 year old dog would.<br>  <br>  You may be willing to pay anything, but only do this if the vet thinks his prognosis will be good for a good quality of life.  If it's not good, then please consider putting him down.|`|AA11244754	You need to have talked to your vet about this when they told you about the tumor and needing to remove his pelvis before you left the office.  You should have asked them several questions such as what the quality of the dog's life would be and if it would make it really difficult for your dog to get around if putting the dog down would be the best course of action.  Your first thought should be the dogs comfort and quality of life not what you would do to keep the dog around.|`|24CFl7sjaa	I would be guided by your vet but be aware that as this is cancer it could re-occur and you could potentially still lose your pet after putting it through the misery of a complicated and painful procedure.|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	i suggest to go with whatever it takes to keep him alive. he deserves that even if hes only 7 yrs old|`|PnZlFQeOaa	Your vet would be the person to ask - how will the animal be able to move around after the surgery?  Will he have the ability to use his remaining back leg?  Will this effect his quality of life?  Are you willing and able to make the adjustments to make his life pleasant?   Most importantly - is the tumor cancer related?  And if it is, what will be the follow up treatment and will it spread - only to have the animal back in surgery at a later date... ponder this.<br>  <br>  Dogs are highly adaptable so if the surgery leaves him unable to walk and you are able to get him/her a cart to move around on - then by all means keep your best friend alive and well.   And if he/she can continue to use the remaining limbs to move around and is happy - all the more reason to keep him/her around!|`|GrYhFNMdaa	I believe you should do it. They do great on three legs and since you said 7 is not old for his breed,im guessing he is a smaller dog. I would do it for sure :) and i hope everything goes great.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	I would give him a chance.  Hopefully the tumour will be removed without cutting bits off & he will live a long & happy life.  Whatever you decide I'm sure it will be the Right thing for him & there will be no suffering.  Good luck.|`|gSpbO1FMaa	If you think he can last longer than you can take him to the vet.<br>  But it's your decision.
4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	It will be a nice dog just introduce cat and dog slowly with a leash so it can't chase the cat. Make sure your cat doesn't hurt the dog either. Good luck its nice your going to save this pup.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	There's not a whole lot anyone on here can tell you about this dog. First off, it's a mutt so there's no breed standard to look at to predict behavior. Temperament will have a lot to do with her training since she's a year old. And about the cat, if the dog was socialized to cats at a young age, it might not have a problem with it.<br>  <br>  But since you are now going to be the owner of this pup, PLEASE dont give it that dumb mutt name. It's a shih tzu mix or a Lhasa apso cross... mixing names for the "designer mutts" is just retarded in my opinion.|`|A21SswSfaa	Since it's a mutt there's no telling what the dog will loom or act like. If the daughter is mean to the dog be prepared to deal with some behavior problems. Socialize her with older, considerate children. I'm sure the dog will get along with cats as long as you introduce them properly.|`|YsMbKwTwaa	No one can really tell, because  mutts have all sorts of different temperments|`|GrYhFNMdaa	Mutts and pure breeds can both be great or both be bad. Depends on how they were raised. Even a pure breed can be completely different from what you read about them. You may need to work with her if she was abused by a child. She could be abit aggressive or just very scared it depends on how she reacts to it (unfortunately). If she has never been around cats then she could be scared of them or go after them, again you would need to work with her. In my experience of knowing the same cross, they are energetic and a little nippy. But that could have been the personality from one of the parents (not becuz of their breed) Its all in how they are raised but you can always teach them :) good luck|`|OFaImbSiaa	Its a mutt, a shih tzu/lhasa apso can be like a shih tzu or a lhasa apso, but anyway they are very similar|`|JM4Uiunqaa	If you want to know the temperament of the dog, go meet it. That is the only way to know how it will/does behave in a given situation. Since it has been mistreated in some way, it may have behavioral issues or training problems that need to be worked through; don't think you are getting a perfect dog for free. Please just call it what it is: a mutt/mix/mongel/heinz 57. It is not a breed, not a hybrid, and not any different than a dog you would find at the pound. That being said, thank you for giving the dog a better home and good luck to you with it!|`|L22hVXTIaa	Even when people say how friendly Labs are, or how great Collies are with kids, etc., they are speaking in generalities.  That is to say, for the most part this breed or that breed is known for demonstrating certain traits.  But, since this dog is not a purebred, you can not attach a breed specific temperament to it.  More importantly, every dog is an individual and you will have to see where this dog's tendencies lie (or is it lay - I can never remember).  Anyway, good luck with the new dog - sounds like she's getting a good home.
3giaPYe8aa	If she tied on Jan, 11th, and that is when conception took place, she would be due March 15, give or take a couple of days. (9 weeks)<br>  <br>  Add:  Ferret and Turtle, go count on your calander...you are both off!|`|gwUMipsUaa	She should be in the house anyway.  What happens if she miscarries?<br>  <br>  Take her to the vet for a checkup.<br>  <br>  I'm very much against having dogs outside when you can't be out there to supervise.  There's a chance another dog got to her when you weren't looking, and she may be having mutts.  Dogs will stick their penises through a fence, and can do it quite easily.<br>  <br>  Small dogs are notorious for needing C Sections, so have a couple thousand $$ on hand in case she needs one.<br>  <br>  Please, don't breed anymore.  There are so many Chihuahuas needing homes, and some of your puppies will wind up with this fate, and ultimately be executed when they are a year or two old.  Happens ALL the time.|`|A21SswSfaa	Dogs are pregnant for about 63 days. You've taken her in to see the vet, right? But dogs can have puppies early or late. If she's not in the house she should be. Pregnant dogs need to be watched carefully, checked every day, and kept safe and healthy. I hope you're aware that Chihuahuas frequently need c-sections. You're prepared in case of an event like that, right?|`|l0qZNFQkaa	look around march 5-6th<br>   she shouldn't be outside  thou you  might want to bring her in now. stress can make they have early puppies and early puppies don't live.<br>   you might want to have an x-ray done to see how many are there so you  know when she is done.<br>   get the vet to go over what  she needs and what the puppies will need. so you can go ahead and get these stuff ready.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Usually 63 days after conception.  I would bring her inside in a couple of weeks.|`|Oih4meo9aa	Dogs are pregnant for 9 weeks ( 63 days ) so i would say last week of February or first week of March|`|gSpbO1FMaa	Take her to the vet to get some answer needed.<br>  If you are worried about her going in to labor at night then put her in some ones room where they would wake-up if she starts to whine,or some thing of that source. <br>  You could also put her in the hall where you could hear her.<br>  Good Luck
cNStB5ZQaa	mating ritual.  he's trying to inseminate her.  once it "takes" & she's pregnant, you'll eventually be able to see the babies eyes through her abdomen!  BUT, once she starts to deliver (the babies are born live & swimming) every fish in the tank will feast on them. even grosser, the mother will eat them as fast as she births them!  you can get a live bearer breeding cage that hangs on the side of the tank,  put the expectant mom in it, and when they're birthed, the  babies should drop to an enclosed partition & be safe from their cannabalistic kin.  if you intend to raise them they'll need special powdered live bearer baby food.  they can breed like rabbits and soon overcrowd your tank, so it might be better to just let nature take it's course.  i know of what i speak:  my 2 convict cichlids are now 200 & i can't bring myself to kill them.  good luck|`|SOxdyWQOaa	maybe a bully watch if you see stress add some stress coat and pull that fish out and put it in a different tank<br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish|`|29Um8OCvaa	It sounds like your mollies are mating. The male will butt the female's abdomen to encourage mating, and shortly after, he WILL mate. Make sure you get a couple more females, because a male will easily stress out one female. You will get babies in about a month, and you will keep getting babies for about six months, even without a male, because females can store sperm. Put the babies in a separate tank or breeder net, and they can be fed crushed up flakes. <br>  <br>  Here's the difference of a male and female molly:<br>  Female:<br>  <a href="http://www.fishdeals.com/livebearers/mollies/home.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishdeals.com/livebearers/mol...</a><br>  Male:<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Black_Molly_3_Male.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  Male/Female comparison:<br>  <a href="http://thesmileyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tropicalfish010.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://thesmileyfish.com/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>  If you DO have two females or two males, and they are being aggressive, wait for a while, and if it doesn't get better, put one molly in a separate tank, or get a tank divider.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  Happy fish keeping!<br>  <br>  Here's a site that will help with the breeding process of mollies:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/raising_baby_fish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/...</a><br>  <br>  P.S. Mollies give birth to live babies!|`|asXq2cFDaa	I would not say bully, in my experience with mollies, the male will do that before mating with the female.<br>  Looks like you might have some babies on the way! You probably will not see the mating as it only takes a few seconds to happen.<br>  <br>  This is also a good reason there should be more females than males because to much of males chasing them around trying to mate can really cause stress, always have at least 2 females for every male. Here is how you tell the difference.<br>  Male- <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Black_Molly_3_Male.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  Now look in the same place at a female molly- <a href="http://www.thetechherald.com/media/images/200817/eamolly123_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetechherald.com/media/image...</a><br>  See how the anal fin is in a fan shape and the males is in a pointy shape, this is so he can mate easier. I hope this helps!|`|b7zwuj4Vaa	Your mollies are obviously mating.<br>  When the the female is about to give birth she will have a black spot on the rear end of her stomach and she will look like she is about to pop.<br>  <br>  <br>  Put her in a hatcher with a grill so when she gives birth the fry will fall into the bottom.<br>  When she has finished giving birth take her out and the grill.<br>  She will have 50-80 fry depending on haw  old she is.<br>  She will be pregnant for 28-35 days.<br>  Feed the fry fry food(which you can buy from the fish store)4-8 times a day.<br>  Hope this helps good luck!|`|ClZWgDoxaa	Yeah it's definitely bullying the other fish.

MH4BYgxjaa	My cat has had a UTI, it's a very serious and expensive problem. I was prescribed a cat food that can only be brought at the vets office that will help keep the problem in check. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a cat littler that will help you determine if there's blood in the urine, I'd suggest a Cedar litter. It's lighter and will make it easier to determine if there is blood present, if there it is a significant amount.<br>  <br>  I'd also suggest keeping the water dish full of fresh water and offering the cat wet food as it's often the hard variety that helps attribute to the problem. Keep an eye on poor kitty, if he's not very active and not' eating the problem has gotten very bad. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope Kitty gets better.|`|4ZAiFYJoaa	Unless it is really a severe infection, you will most likely not see blood in the urine anyway.  It is seen under a microscope and on a test strip that shows the presence of blood.  As another person said, the best thing to do is have your cat rechecked in two weeks or when you finish the antibiotics.  Also watch for the signs in the future, such as frequent urination, and not using the litter box.  Good luck!|`|WpsPLKS7aa	Usually there is not enough blood to see.  Just give her the meds and have her rechecked in 2 weeks.|`|LMMSXldBaa	My oldest cat has had three UTI's in three years. She didnt have enough blood in her urine to be able to see, but we just gave her her meds in wet food and it went away. My suggestion for litter that you maybe able to see is that white crystal pearls litter (super expensive). Since its white, you can see the yellow urine color, so you may be able to see the blood. I hope your kitty gets better!|`|GjeEbxkzaa	i dont know any specific brands. can't you look around in a store? good luck with your cat. :)

They are very sweet, loyal dogs.  They are very smart and train well, but they get spoiled very quickly so watch out for that.  I've had Poms that range from barking non-stop to the dog I have now who hardly ever barks.  Do your research.  They tend to have health problems such as luxating patellas and collapsing trachea's.  They have a double coat so plan on spending a lot of time and a bit of money on grooming.  I don't know any breeders in the UK, but if there are any Pomeranian rescue groups, I'd recommend that.  I always get my Poms recycled:)|`|QuUoDkBLaa	Please don't go to a breeder, go to a rescue shelter such as the Dogs Trust and see if they have one there.<br>  Breeders often treat their dogs with no care or respect and are only in it for the money.<br>  If you do HAVE to go to a breeder though, make sure that you see the puppy with it's mother.|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	yes i have 3 wonderful poms, they are a wonderful; little dog. You asked for tips, really they need the same as any other breed, love, attention and discipline, lots of grooming. Socialising with people and other dogs. Poms are very loyal, loving dogs they come from the toy group of dogs, Origin Germany. Height around 28 - 29 cm ,Weight 2 - 3 kg , Life 12 - 14 years , they are very extrovert, lively and intelligent, dont like being left at home alone. Because they have a double coat there fur can easier matt so they need daily brushing to prevent this from helping. Like most toy breeds they can suffer with Patella luxation affects many breeds of dogs. A poms energetic lifestyle will always put strain upon what is basically a rather complex and fragile joint. Breeders and judges who weed out dogs with patella luxation from breeding programmes and awards are doing everyone a great service whether they be two legged or four legged. I buy joint aid to mix in there foodto help with this. They are very clever and were used to enterain in cirus so you can train them, i have put a link of one of mine praying, he is so sweet, also a link to see my 3 growing up. You must look at the pup's home and see the mum, mum should always be there, if she is not avaiable i would be abit concerned. When a pom is around 6 months or more they have an ugly stage where the hair goes and they look strange, this is very common and no need to worry, they havent got mange etc. Poms can suffer with colitis so you need to find a good food. This you will see on my pictures. If you have any other questions that i have not asnwered you are more than welcome to send me an email via my 360, i will asnswer you 100% confidential asap. Poms are great little dogs, you will have fun.

They look cute but they act so mean. All they do is bark, bite and misbehave. They make horrible pets unless you are willing to do some super serious training for a long, long time. I thin you should go to the animal shelter and adopt a pit bull mix, lab mix, or any other kind of mutt. There are poor dogs out there who are going to be euthanized if they do not find homes and you want to buy a bratty little pom! That is horrible! <br>  <br>  I think you should ADOPT a dog/puppy from here:  <a href="http://www.dogsindanger.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogsindanger.com/</a>|`|nFANuZUmaa	I have a Pom and they are one of my favorite breeds.  They have the gift of giving you laughter when you are down and are a very social breed.  One of the things that make me laugh are the males are all "macho" and the females are "proper" in behaivor more than may breeds I've delt with.  They are smart and can be head strong so I recommend training asap.  <br>  <br>  I recommend contacting the UKC Pomeranian Club for more info on the breed.  You shouln't get a ldog just because its cute.  Do your homework to see if a Pom is right for you.<br>  <br>  Then contact the UK Chapter of Association of Pet Dog Trainers and find a trainer once you get your dog.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Some breeders will also ship puppies.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Look for a breeder that sells English bloodline labradors.

8ATXyOrkaa	Nope, that is the beak starting to pip a hole in the shell. Soon the egg will start rocking, and you will hear peeping, and then the pip will do what is called zipping, and the chick will open the egg all the way around and then emerge. The pip process can last up to 2 days. What kind of bird are you hatching?|`|9YDlJMlEaa	No they aren't kicking, but they will probably hatch withing a couple hours!! Cancrats to u and your new pets!

boOi7xJJaa	Your female maybe to old to breed, and produce viable offspring    .  You need to do a lot more to become a breeder then just allow two hamsters to mate.  You will need to do lots of research, and find the best animals to start out your breeding program.  But please do as much research as possible first.  Write me if you need more info.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	First off, get the sand out of the tank.  It acts as an insulator and doesn't allow the heat from the UTH to penetrate to the top of the substrate.  Putting him on a solid, thinner substrate will allow it to heat up a lot easier.  Also, I highly doubt that it's not getting about 60.  My guess is that you're using a stick-on thermometer that's measuring air temps and that it is far hotter on the floor of the tank.    You need to go get a digital thermometer and measure the temps on the floor of the tank.  My guess is that your lamp is making it a LOT hotter than it should be.  That said, the lack of eating is probably from stress due to you leaving locusts in the tank (please take them out as soon as possible) and because it's getting too hot in the tank.  And at night, your air temps are dropping too low in light of the UTH being on.  With a few adjustments, your leo should start eating again.|`|FvAl3UgQaa	What substrate is he on?    Do you have a heat mat under his tank to prevent the night-time temps from dropping too low?    Has he shed recently?    *****************************  Edit:    I've kept adult leo's on sand, with no problems, but obviously impaction is something you need to consider as a possibility with sudden loss of appetite.     Are you using play-sand?     Have you noticed fewer or a total lack of faeces in the viv recently?    That's 15C isn't it? That is a bit cold, for sure, but I doubt this weather will last for long and I wouldn't leave the heat lamp on overnight as it could stress him. A short spell of cold nights shouldn't have any long term ill effects.    I asked about the shedding thing as I know that ours won't eat for a while after a shed because they're so stuffed full of the ingested skin, but sounds like that doesn't apply...    My advice would be to try him on waxworms. If he refuses them, you probably do have a real problem!|`|h4xcrlUuaa	read that other persons question(the one having issues with eating) i just answered there. and do something about the heat. they need heat to help digest.|`|vV425TqZaa	I had the same problem with my first one, but the best cause of this is the cold that has run over your home. But my first one had died and he never ate but the cold wasn't the case, there is a possibility the it is blind.
tNhFC1fmaa	Use bottled distilled water.  Make sure the water isn't cold and keep it between 72-80 degrees for hatching.  It you keep a light directed on the tank, they will hatch faster.    If you do all of this correctly, they will hatch within 18-48 hours.  Hope this helps!|`|x4etCpauaa	Use bottled water.  Add eggs.  Wait a few days.    ("'\(o.o)/"')

Never get a dog food with Corn, Soy, and By-Products. But I would also suggest a wheat free dog food. When you change your dogs food to a better quality, you will notice these things :    Firmer Stool, Glossier Coat, and better overall health.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Some dogs do fine on Iams, others don't.  It used to be a good food, but they changed the formula a few years ago and it has a lot more "by-products" (euphemism for chicken feet and beaks, etc.) than it used to.      If your dog is doing okay on it, then fine.  I fed Iams for years and probably still would be if one of my dogs hadn't developed grain allergies.  But it is *not* one of the top foods.      I love apple pie, too, but it is probably not a good idea for me to eat it exclusively! :-)|`|s3gwur9zaa	yea..its one of the like top 5 brands of dog food|`|1FPpglMpaa	sorry but it is mediocre food.  It contains mostly filler poor quality protein.  If you shop for you dog at a big box store such as Petco or Petsmart you can slowly switch your dog to a better food such as Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, or Wellness.   just be sure to switch slowly over a two week or so time period.    edit:  to blunt object.. of course food equal love.  we feed our selves and our children good quality food because we love them. why wouldn't we also feed good quality food to our pets..|`|AA11331047	Google "Iams dog food review" you will find lots of information that way. I personally would not buy any food that you can get at a grocery store.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Being in dog training (basic and in sports), animal rescue, and showing, there is a big difference in food. However, you need to feed your dog what works for them.    Yes, it is better to buy a food NOT sold in supermarkets and pet stores. They do contain fillers. However, unless the food is contaminated or pure crap (I will not mention any brands, its not fair to point fingers), your dog will be fine.    How I see it is this. I love McDonalds. Love it love it love it. I would also LOVE to eat it every single day. Is it good for me? Not at all. Do I still like it? Yes.    Same concepts with many lower quality dog foods. Is it good for your dog? Most likely not, but neither is McDonalds good for us. Do they still like it? Of course, most dogs will eat their own poop. Of course they love it.    At least you feed your dog.     The shelter I pull last chance animals from recommends Science Diet. There is nothing "Scientific" about it. It's not a good quality food, but your dogs/cats will still be fine on it.  =)|`|rql2ZEJcaa	ripp a   i dont think u kno wot ur talkin about.  on yahoo answers i read that complete foods r rubbish......... fresh meat is the way forwad. followin this advice i took my pup off science hill n weaned him on2 fresh foods............ result--- horrendous diahorrea!!!  how is that good for him ripp a?? answer me that if u kno what U ARE talking about!!!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	It's not bad. Probably a rung above Pedigree Chum/Bakers/supermarket own stuff, quality wise - although I've found it to be as useless for weight loss as any of these brands.     People will warn you that Iams do terrible animal testing - that was a whole big thing a couple of years ago, they've since opened their doors for people to come and see their standards for themselves, suggest you read all about it before judging on that.    Chalice|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No it isn't.  It is made of mostly fillers & crap instead of good food your dog needs.  Look at these sites for your self.  This site teaches you to rate foods for yourself & what your dog needs & what to avoid.    http://www.acreaturecomfort.com/ratingpe...    This one shows how your food rates - not even 3 stars out of 10.    http://dogfoodchat.com/dog-food-ratings/    I feed Natural Balance which costs the same as Iams or Blue Buffalo which is a lil higher but you feed less of the better quality foods than yours.|`|qMhUhAALaa	Hello! Iams is a very good dog food. The "better" feed has many advantages verses a no name food. The higher quality feed is more nutritious, more vitamins, balanced with protein, calories and having less fillers. And the biggest advantage to us humans with using a food like IAM'S is the dog doesn't have to go to the potty as much, as the food is much more digestible and the dog holds on to more of it and therefore "poops" less, the poop is firmer, less of it, just easier al the way around, not to mention BETTER for your dog!! I personally use Royal Canin, love it, but, PHEWW expensive! LOL|`|QVP8zSuWaa	it one the worse ones out there IMHO  http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/|`|vPde97E2aa	It's FINE!    I've been using Iams for DECADES & will CONTINUE,no matter what the "food-nazis" blather!    Food does NOT equal "love"!!!

qGy9fR7xaa	Definitely go for the hamster!! :)  I was very surprised to see how easy it was to look after my first hamster - i was thirteen and responsible for everything to do with the hamster! The cages are small, and compared to my rat's cage, so much easier to clean. The hamsters them selves are so cute, and easy to look after. They are quite cheap, too. Apart from the cage, all you need to buy them in things like food and toys. Vet bills wasn't a problem, either. My hamster lived over two years, and she was only sick and had to go to the vets once in her life!    Mice are fun, but they're so small and quick it's pretty hard to hold them or keep them sitting still for more than five seconds!!  Apparently they smell a lot, too.     I'd definitely go for the hamster! They're cheap, clean animals, very cute and rewarding once you get to know them!    ~Good luck!!~|`|5BV5vLRFaa	If you're looking into rodents, I'd go for a guinea pig and skip the hamsters, gerbils, mice. You can train them and they are pretty content sitting with you.  I'd say that they are the most fun and aren't too expensive.  There are also different varieties and colors--long haired, short hair, solid color and mixed colors.  You just need to feed them about twice a day and give them lots of carrots for vitamin C.  They don't smell that bad.....just replace the wood shavings about once to twice a week.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	My gerbils cost me around $76, including some extra stuff I thought I wasn't going to buy. Hamsters sleep all day. They hate being woken up. They bite. They stink. They kick bedding out of their cage. Their cages are hard to clean.    Mice are cute, but poop a lot! They don't cost much though.    Gerbils don't cost much, they live in tanks (so easy to clean it's ridiculous), they don't bite (as much, mine have only bit me when I held them for 8 min.), they don't poop as much as mice, and they don't stink. It is their bedding.       I say get gerbils (yes, gerbil --->s    Get a gerbils please, and save your time and money. :)      Hope I helped! :D|`|J7o7FtZdaa	Get a hamster there are lots of them they are friendly and they make great pets i have to robo hamsters and they are so cute.|`|Bm3vyuNpaa	NO!!!!!! Get the cute and adorable mouse!!!!! They love to play, and don't bite, (UNlike hamsters.)|`|s3gwur9zaa	i would get the hamster|`|sPVJ8XZjaa	Hmmm....hard to answer....I can tell you what I prefer...I have 2 dwarf hammies and as cute as they are, they just don't capture my heart as my Black Bear "Sophi". Nibbler and Honey are very fast critters and prefer to run away from you...Sophi is a Black Bear Hammie and is pretty laid back girl. She loves to ride in my pocket, and is very social. I would chose a Syrian Hamster if you want a hammie that you can interact with.|`|Nyl9Jorsaa	They are all easy pets to take care of. The one thing about hamsters is they sleep all day. Gerbils sleep during the day too but when you pull them out to play they are very active and playful. And a mouse wouldn't be your best one to choose. So if you want an active pet go for the gerbil, but hamsters are fun too. Just not as active.    All of these are very affordable. The most expensive thing will be their cage.|`|EXn6yaNIaa	go for hammies!|`|KA9DP41Taa	forget everything get a dog they are way better then any pet if you are still leaning towards a rodent get a gerbil there are still the best pet|`|GS9Bz0pAaa	Oooo defo hamster! Theyre wicked lol .. Especially the Syrians as theyre easily tamed and loving and also.. theres just more of a hamster .. mice and gerbils are too small for me .. and the tails freak me out hehe x|`|RNqHUNgEaa	Mice -cheapest  Hamster -least fun/average expense  Gerbil -most fun/most expensive    I like Hamsters the best, but Gerbils are the most fun. Gerbils are more active, they are social and NEED company, they are athletic and love to run around the cage and play, they are much sweeter than hamsters and much less likely to bite. Mice are hard to hold, hard to keep in their cage, skittish, and not as fun. Gerbils need the biggest cage because they run around so much, they also need to be kept in pairs, and it's best for them to have lots of toys. Hamsters are slower, they are solitary and fight if kept in pairs, they are not fast, don't play as much and are much more likely to bite. Dwarf Hamsters are much more likely to bite than Syrian Hamsters, but they are cuter and faster.|`|ta3wiCvtaa	I would say a mouse over the other two. Mice are great pets and very smart and social. Out of all the mice that I've had, I've never had one that bit. All of the hamster I've had bit. They are very friendly and cute as well.     If your mom doesn't want you to get a pet then you can't get one. It's her house and her rules. You can't force her to agree with you. That's why you save your money while you're young and get your own place to live when you get old enough. Then you can have all the critters you can handle.|`|YCvgjLdnaa	hamster!! |`|680ceb9ae3a1a539087fa7d9352af23daa	GERBILS SHOULD RULE THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|I3W8Yt5gaa	http://my.att.net/s/s.dll?spage=search%2...  look how cute these rats are!I have 2 currently and love them so much!

15e4b23d09e63ca5a1ecc092fae0dadcaa	-Your dog is getting too much air in when he drinks and eats.....his food and water need to be elevated. Raise them up off the floor so that they are more to his height, that way he doesn't have to stand way above his food to eat.

I would also ask about getting both micro chips. My dogs have both. Both meaning there is a new version coming out that most are able to scan and also the old microchip that almost all have.

It's a good way to prove it's your dog in case of a problem.  And if she gets out and is found the microchip will get her back to you.  It's not painful or harmful to the dog.    Look for microchip clinics in your area.  You may see fliers at pet stores or vet clinics.  Sometimes a dog club will have a clinic as a fundraiser and these usually have good prices.  I believe it would be around $30 or so.  One of the best $30 you'll ever spend.

AA10328947	Guppies is a big no no , did you tell the shopkeeper you had guppies in there? if so he or she needs to be shot. Kaz , try and keep them in the same tank but quarantine them from the rest in anyway you can, don't use any soap at all if you are going to put them in containers as the answerer down there has said. Here's some tips:Take them back to the shop, put them in a breeding trap or put them in a bag with water and leave to float in the tank until you can sort out whats to be done.<br>  Compatible fish of other species: Hobbyists put Betta splendens in tanks with other species after careful research and preparation. Common tankmates include platies (moons), Corydoras catfish, and loaches. Females can share a tank with danios, tetras, barbs, and gouramis, but males should not be kept with these species as they tend to nip at their long fins. Shrimp are popular tank-mates because, provided with sufficient natural plant cover, they keep the tank clean without causing stress to the bettas.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The success of a betta in a community aquarium, however, is largely dependent on the particular betta's level of aggression. Whereas some bettas make wonderful community fish, particularly belligerent or skittish bettas are best housed alone. Bettas are very aggressive towards long-finned fish, the guppy for example.<br>  <br>  Incompatible fish of other species:<br>  <br>  Very small fish (smaller than one inch) may be eaten. <br>  Fish with long, flowing fins may trigger aggression. This includes fancy guppies, white cloud mountain minnows, and some long-finned tetra species. <br>  Slow-swimming fish, e.g. fancy guppies, will be unable to escape bullying. <br>  Mollies tend to bite the fin or (if large enough) eat bettas. <br>  Fish belonging to the same biological family as the betta, such as Paradise Fish and gouramis, may attack or be attacked due to their relatively similar appearance and cross species aggression. <br>  Goldfish are unsuitable tank-mates because of their great appetites, preference for cold water, and high excretion-rate. Like many tropical fish, Betta splendens might harass and kill small, slow fancy goldfish; in return, goldfish have been known to bite a Betta's tail. Goldfish also are best suited to a colder water tank than the tropical Betta Splendens.|`|NHs3LxlLaa	Get two plastic cups, fill them with tank water and peg them onto the side of your aquarium.

No need to panic. Just do not fill the jar/container to the top as they will come up for air and can jump out. If you have lids then make sure there are breathing holes in them.

m0e3a3gWaa	When cleaning decorations please do NOT use soap or bleach.  Wiping them with a cloth and some warm water will be fine.  And no, it will not hurt the fish.    Oh and, its your fish tank and this hobby is supposed to be fun so Don't listen to these people, if you want a shipwreck get a shipwreck!|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Before you do all that, consider getting at least a 30 gallon tank. This tank is overstocked. Goldfish get quite large when in the proper environment.     As far as changing the decor, you should have no problems doing this. Just do not change the filter media at the same time. It should not hurt the fish at all to remove the plants and clean them. All you have to do is be sure you wash your hands in some warm water. Do not use any soap, any trace of soap can kill your fish. Rinse them and place them back into the tank.=|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Don't worry about hurting them while redecorating, they will swim away even if you do come close to hurting them.

Don't get a shipwreck, it's too big and will take away a lot of the goldfish's swimming space.  try to make sure your fish realize that you are putting something into the water before you just toss it in so they know to move out of the way.  get some fellow snails for the tankto keep the algae under control|`|x4etCpauaa	Whatever the type of goldfish you have it can grow from half a foot to a foot long. A 10 gallon tank is to small for just one goldfish.     Adding decorations such a shipwreck is a bad idea. With 2 goldfish you are limiting even more swimming space.

RNqHUNgEaa	I have had several different hamsters and my preferences are breed specific.    For Dwarf Hamsters I like aquariums the best. Dwarfs are very susceptible to drafts that can make them sick. They also don't produce as much poop and pee so the ammonia levels don't build up in the cage. I also like aquariums better because a lot of dwarfs can easily fit through the bars in a cage, and dwarfs aren't very athletic and are too small to fit through those multi-layer cage tubes.    For syrian hamsters (black bears included) I prefer cages. They are big enough to fit through the tubes and climb in them. They produce more poop and pee so ammonia levels would build up faster if it were in an aquarium, they are not as susceptible to drafts, and they cannot fit through the bars.|`|ta3wiCvtaa	Definitely a wire cage to give proper air flow and circulation.

Wire cages (coated wire, not bare as it Will rust) provide the best airflow and ventilation for their often feeble little lungs. But if they're small they might be able to squeeze through the bars. And having wee rodents running about is good for no one.  Just use your best judgment. If you do use a wire cage, I highly suggest the Super Pets brand.  And.....Use CareFresh bedding! It's really the only thing that is really healthy for them. Wood shavings are dusty and have wood oils that can cause respiratory infections.|`|YZYhgvA7aa	i have 3 hamsters and 3 cages. I would personally get a cage|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Neither one is better or worse than the other.  But bin cages provide more space than you could get with either one!  Check out the info below the rest of my answer :)    If you don't go with a bin, here's my answer to aquarium vs "standard" cage.     Make sure you use at least a 20 gallon aquarium (30 gallon long would be better) with a fitted, locking mesh lid (normally found in the reptile section of the pet store).  There's PLENTY of ventilation in an aquarium - they won't suffocate, hyperventilate or die from fumes - most breeders use bins or aquariums because they provide the most space for hamsters.  You can still set up tubes inside the cage for them to play in and there's more space for them to move around even with their wheel, house and lots of toys :)    If you go with a cage, your Syrian (Black Bears are Syrian hamsters) you'll want a quite large one.  They need extra room to move around, although they still love the tubes and climbing the wires.  Be sure not to get one with a mesh bottom, their feet can get trapped, broken, or worse they could get bumble foot.  The multi-story cages work great for this.    No matter what type you end up with - be sure to never use pine or cedar bedding (which I'm sure you already know from your dwarf babies, but others reading this may not) and just use common sense :)    Here's the info on bin cages with pics, links, instructions, and sooo much more :)    Bin cages are the best way to house hamsters, whether they're Syrian (Teddy Bear, Honey Bear, Golden, Panda) or Dwarf (Russian, Winter White, Roborovski or chinese).    I personally think they allow the most creativity while still giving your hamster room to move around.  Almost every breeder I know, and most rescue groups will tell you they're the best way to go as well :)    They're virtually escape proof because the sides are so tall, and there's SO much more room for your hamster (or hamsters if you have dwarfs) to move around in.  You can load them with toys and still put in fun tube arrangements for them to play in. There's more space to change things around - hamsters get bored easily so moving and changing out their toys is important in keeping them active and entertained!       You should use a large, bin that's transparent - no dyes (ie colors) because the chemicals could hurt your pet if they chew on it.    Here's an idea of what the best type of bin should look like, and the size you'll want to look for, it doesn't need to be this particular brand, but this is they type you'll want:    http://www.rubbermaid.com/rubbermaid/pro...

I've had hamsters for years and couldn't give you any better advice that she has.|`|uDQmkdouaa	NO AQUARIUM! since hamsters are so tiny they can easily get respiratory infections. with an aquarium there is not enough ventilation and all of the fumes can harm them. so go with a nice normal wire cage with levels, a wheel, food dish etc.... make sure that u are not using pine or cedar! (also very bad for their respiratory system.) get carfresh bedding for them!     =)    good luck!
IuYekkPVaa	Many cats don't like using the same box for peeing and pooing, so try providing a second box in a different location to see if that helps.  It wouldn't hurt to change to clumping style litter as it makes it easier for the cat to avoid standing in soiled litter.    Unfortunately, bleach isn't the best thing to use for cleaning.  It contains ammonia and to a cat smells just like urine, so it reinforces in their mind that this is a good spot for toileting.  You can use ordinary biological (enzymatic) washing detergent mixed with warm water for cleaning up.  Afterwards spray the area with surgical spirit (cheap at the chemist) to remove any lingering trace of his scent.|`|vl6OtBfWaa	Sometimes an enclosed and private box can help also once we had a cat that would not go in box but he loved pooping in our potted citrus tree's so we got him a gig terra cotta pot full of dirt and put little fences around the tree's.  He loved it.    Its hard to know whats going on cause they cannot talk but rial and error is the best way to go.|`|aEAEinjPaa	i suggest you bring him to a vet, he must be getting old and hes probably sick.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	To answer your first point - get him an extra litter tray as many cats will not pee and poo in the same tray (this habit can start at any time).    Secondly - yes, change to clumping litter as (as you say) it keeps everything in one place.  The problem could be that the litter is staying quite wet because it does not clump.  This means that your cat is getting back into wet litter to poo and it will get stuck on his fur/paws which he then has to lick off - yuck!  Don't use scented litter, as again, he will have to lick it off.  Make sure the litter is as close to sand as possible as this is soft on their paws.  As your cat gets older and probably heavier, some litter can hurt their paws.  This is especially true when it comes to pooing as they tend to scrape around more to cover it.      Lastly, if you think your cat has an upset stomach then you should consult your vet.  Perhaps he cannot always get to the litter tray in time and this is why he is going on the floor.  You should definitely be giving your cat a more mixed diet.  A completely dry diet is not good for cats as they are carnivores and need MEAT - not the grains/fillers and other rubbish contained in dry food.  If your cat is not drinking enough water the dry food can cause constipation.  Strangely enough, constipation can then turn into diarrhoea and this is what might be causing the "mushy" problem.  A small amount of dry is fine but you really need to start introducing a good quality high protein/lo carb wet meat (you can research this over the internet but I use Bozita).  Your cat might also be having a reaction to mixed proteins in his food (check the packet).  Some cats are very sensitive to this and should have a single protein diet (solely chicken, solely beef, etc)Please don't believe what you read about dry food being good for teeth as there is absolutely no truth in this at all.  Dry food is one of the major contributing factors to diabetes and kidney/urinary disease in older cats.  I have one cat with diabetes and one with struvite crystals and I have to say that a simple yearly dental check would have been easier to deal with than these 2 life threatening diseases.    Good luck.|`|0sJsTN83aa	Does he get around fine everywhere else?  Still climbing the couch and all that?  If so, he's fine, but he's angry and is acting out.  Is there another cat in the house, or any other animals?  They may have messed with his box so now he's not interested.    A simple fix would be Cat Attract, it helps bring the cat into the litter box.  You may also try getting a new box, because something about that one has upset him.  If there are multiple cats in the house, each one often needs their own box or else this sort of behavior is typical.      Also upgrade his food, it sounds like he's having issues with whatever he's eating.  Try soft food and/or a Senior Cat food that's higher quality (yes, Wal-Mart and Kroger brands are cheaper, but they're primarily made of corn and rice), cats need meat so look for a product that lists a meat source as it's first ingredient on the back.  Good luck!

I would NOT post questions on the computer.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The substance that is toxic is hypericin, and there are over 50 species that can be found in pastures that contain it.  Some horses find the plants highly palatable and will readily eat the plants.  It is not toxic to the organs of the body, but collects in skin and causes sensitivity to UV rays.  The liver damage referred to that is seen in ragwort toxicity is caused by a different toxin and is not present in hypericin toxicity.  The horse can be miserable, with inflammation and itching, if exposed to sunlight.  If the horse is allowed to continue feeding on the St. Johnswort, it can lead to blindness.  The vet should be called and examine the horse anytime there is any poisoning.  Hair loss is not a typical finding in hypericin toxicity.  If by bald,  you mean your horse is light skinned in these areas, and therefore the photosensitivity is damaging the skin in those areas, then it makes sense.  The vet should make the diagnosis.  The poison has to be absorbed out of her skin gradually while she is kept in during the day, and only allowed out at night in an area free of the toxic plants.  The vet may prescribe soothing medications if she is miserable, but don't use anything not prescribed by your vet.  The best treatment is to get rid of the source.|`|iy3NISVGaa	Unless you are sure it's poisoning  I tend to think more in the line of ringworm - get the vet and in the meantime disinfect everything!!  do not touch her unless you have rubber gloves on and wash every item of clothing you wear near her immediately after taking them off.

He can test it.   Unless you are absolutely sure of what it is, be careful treating it, you could make it worse. It may or may not be some kind of toxicity.  Don't leave it untreated.  Even if it is plant poisoning, simply putting him in a barn is not a cure. And just because you may have the plant, horses are not likely to eat poisonous plants unless they are needing more to eat or it comes in the hay.|`|RloOJ43haa	I'm sorry, but reading articles does not make you a vet.

I never flush cat poop down the toilet because their poop gets very hard (almost like little rocks) and it can damage the toilet plumbing....|`|lFqUMMAGaa	I have an indoor cat ~ I use a wood base litter and the poo I flush down the loo and the wee I bag up in babys nappy bags and put in the rubbish ~  I hope this helps with your strange question ~|`|MqYfsYd0aa	i know there is a litter out there that is 'flushable'... but i'm willing to guess it's just the waste itself with some of the litter that can be flushed... can't say i know exactly, i throw mine away in the trash :)|`|YdJgrgvdaa	we put ours in the the bin|`|DRSjrp04aa	U can use the bin, in parks you can use the dog litter bins, the gouverment arnt gonna sue (spelling?) you, because people dont take their cats for walks normally, or you can buy an outside bin especcialy for the ****.|`|LbfwxW3yaa	in a platic bag, tie it, then put it straight in the dustbin|`|K5uoaetaaa	I bag it and bin it, poo and litter.|`|wcDy86xuaa	I place it with the general garbage and have it picked up by the city on trash day.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	Actual litter is bagged up and disposed in the garbage.  The cat poo itself can go right down the toilet.|`|JjbragXNaa	I scoop poop every day.  I put all the waste into a trash bag, seal the bag, and put it in the trash can outside.  You can try to flush it, but I don't recommend it.|`|HZuLVEEsaa	I put the whole lot in with the other general rubbish (non recyclable stuff). Im sure you could flush the poo down the loo if you wanted to though.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	I recycle a plastic grocery bag by putting the cat poo in it and tieing it with a knot so it doesn't smell. I put it in the garbage. I wouldn't recommend the toilet since the litter may clog it. You could always bury the poo in your flower garden as a fertilizer.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	If you put it down the loo, you have to have a good flush as little bits of litter end up at the bottom of the bend.    Daily, scoop out the poop and clumped wee and dispose of in a plastic bag or crumpled newspaper.  Double wrap the whole lot from the tray in supermarket carrier bags once a week.|`|mR5RkClpaa	well that is what i do , i am very particular about my two cats litter tray, i use a wood pellet sort of litter it is made from recovered sawdust,and as soon as my cats use it , for poo, i lift it out with paper and flush it down toilet then i top it up a wee bit, i then daily empty whole tray and put it in a black bag and it goes in bin, there is never any poo in it as i said i flush that,and the litter does not smell too bad as it gets renewed daily, i dont let much litter go down toilet, it has a good flush ,|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I scoop the litter boxes daily, placing the waste in small trash bags and tying them.  I put the small bags into a lined trash can outside.  Once a week I remove the bag from the can outside to be picked up by trash collectors.  When I empty the litter boxes I just empty them into a trash bag to be picked up by the trash collectors.  I don't recommend flushing the poo.  If there's any cat litter on it, your plumbing lines will eventually become clogged by the litter.|`|f7f1dbd297b05e58dcc42220734cebb4aa	The litter box is cleaned out as soon as i see the cat has used it and the contents of the litter box is put in a supermarket bag and put in to the brown wheelie bin, Incidentally I always use a large black plastic wheelie bin bag in the wheelie bin first.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Ha ha, not a silly question at all actually - I put it all in the general bin (outside). I'd like to flush poo away but it's always got litter stuck to it and that doesn't flush first time and would probably block up the toilet in the end.    At work we have to dispose of it in a special bag, but there are not laws for where the general public put animal waste so long as it is some sort of disposal.    Chalice|`|723qR6p8aa	Heyya x  I put the poo in a babies nappy bag before putting it in the black bin. This means it doesn't get the bin all stinky or anything and its easier to dispose. Not a silly question at all. Yes it could be flushed down the toilet i suppose LOL but i'd use the bin. The one i use is the black dont know if you can use the others.  Hope this helps a bit.  Mwah/.x|`|it3ecbVEaa	i have scented bin liners i put it into them then put it into the normal bin outside, don't put it down the loo it sticks in the pipes and the cat litter doesn't flush away properly, reason i know this i used to do it and it clogged up the pipe work from the toilet to the sewer..|`|KGHbAERDaa	yes the brown bin i think|`|n4zSSH9jaa	l have 3 cats, they have wood based litter, and their poo and bits of litter go down the toilet, then the rest of the litter goes in the bin.|`|d91baab57ede7e82483e9972070f9779aa	Depends on the type of litter. The clumping fullers earth type has to go in the dustbin, preferably in dogie poo bags first.If it is the paper type or wood type then it can be disposed off in compost bins or buried in the garden. I would never flush it down the loo in case it  caused a blockage.|`|01f954e00f6c128ad0a0d25eee94e023aa	I throw mine out in the dumpster
AA11331047	Maybe she has a thyroid disorder.|`|80S8U7Edaa	Once every 2 months... wow... well, maybe you should try a different shampoo and conditioner. Here are some great ones for dry skin:    http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p89/comfy-d...    http://www.gingerpuplane.com/p87/fur-but...|`|riCfCxjEaa	How frustrating!  Is it one spot or does it seem to be all over?  Your weimer could have an allergy to something, but seeing that she doesn't mess with it, I'm not positive. I would get a second opinion from another vet.  My doberman has a similar coat and what we found with his dry skin was that we were supplying TOO much fat in his diet which was causing an oil build up and thus, flaky skin.  Try a leaner food and cut back on the omegas a bit and see if it doesn't clear up.  Omegas are great for dogs but make sure it's a high quality omega and not just a lot of unneeded fat.  I hope this helps!
hoOygDw1aa	I'm so sorry to hear about your rabbit!<br>  <br>  When feeding the babies, make sure you feed them on their backs. This is how they would nurse naturally.<br>  <br>  As the babies feed, their stomachs will blow up like balloons. Kits (baby bunnies) litterally look like a ball with a head and four limbs right after they're fed!<br>  <br>  After you're done feeding, gently massage the stomachs of the babies and hold them over a towel. The mother rabbit does this to stimulate urination in the babies.<br>  <br>  It is HARD raising kits by hand and even the most experienced rabbit raisers usually do not have 100% succes. So don't blame yourself if you lose any or all of the kits. It's a tough thing to do, but it sounds like you're doing everything you can to keep them healthy.<br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail me if you need any more help along the way. I'm happy to give advice. I raised one baby this way years ago and she is still with me, I believe she'll be six years old this summer!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Im sure your vet has given feeding instructions. There isn't much else you can do, besides feed them and keep them warm. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Q87djE0laa	awww thats so sad i hope everything works out x

ycPetVy7aa	dear eddy<br>   sorry if i spelt your name wrong<br>  Do a check list first 1  check that she is not in any drafts if she is on the floor give her plenty of bedding hay or straw 2 make sure there is fresh water every day & maybe some vitamins to help her get over any signs of a cold  do you pick her up sometimes, it maybe that she doesn't like the way you pick her up make sure she is brushed often could she be pregnant?  If nothing changes go to the vets, he will tell you what you need to know.. hope it helps PS check mouth & teeth|`|XJEGTZJqaa	well there is a very high chance. you should definetly take her to a vet and get it checked out if she has a wet nose,paw,or ear, Also if she is sneezing she could have a cold! GOOD LUCK :D|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Sounds like it, is her paw wet? She probably does have a cold. <br>  <br>  Is she near a draft (heating vent)?
m0e3a3gWaa	I had the same problem.<br>  My stand cracked so I had to get one ASAP.<br>  My trim was oak but the only stand they had in stock was black.<br>  I used 2 coats of Rust paint.<br>  This was two years ago and still no chipping.<br>  <br>  I also used Gloss BLack not Flat Black.|`|82AxruXBaa	I would use wood grain sticky contact paper...you can buy at walmart or the dollar stores...its easy to apply and looks like real wood...just cut strips the size of your tanks trim....be sure to use a ruler to get a strait edge and smooth out all bubbles under the sticky tape.....But if you must use paint, ONLY use the kind that is non toxic...the kind that is safe for childrens rooms.
KeevlZnTaa	Rats can eat meat occasionally as a treat. I would stick to lean meats, no red meat. Feeding them meat as a treat is not going to harm them, as certainly is not going to make them aggressive(that is an old wives tale). <br>  <br>  Make sure you take into account the size when feeding them. They only need a small piece, not a huge chunk.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Perfectly fine- you can feed your rat pretty much everything except for avocados and chocolate. Make sure you have a varied diet that is mostly grain based. I am assuming you are adding meat for a treat.|`|50KYf5KMaa	I give mine a little pea sized amount of cooked chicken maybe once a week, and he's a VERY picky eater, so whatever he wants, he can have.  His favorites are popcorn, all-natural cheese puffs, natural potato chips, green beans, and rice.  Unfortunately, I haven't found any fruits that he likes, but still looking.  But meat seems to be his ULTIMATE favorite- he'll wrestle with me for a buffalo wing.<br>  And alot of these people are saying to avoid chocolate.  Chocolate has been proven to be good for rats.  The ingredient in chocolate that is harmful to cats and dogs is not harmful to rats.  A lot of breeders also recommend a single chocolate chip to a rat who isn't feeling very well.  It's fine in moderation, because of the caffeine and sugar.  My rat doesn't like candies though.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	The answer above is partially right. Avoid chocolate but there is nothing wrong with except caffeine , which in too high dosage will cause heart problems. <br>  However with your main question of course! Rats are omnivores and my rats favorite treat is turkey!<br>  It is also safe to give them chicken bones as it helps them gnaw their teeth down.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|FAf1y4Q5aa	funny you should ask that ask, as im not sure and have an 8week old but lol I has mentioned to a friend and my mom that I fed him a small amount of lunch meet ham and they acted grossed out, lol and my friend  now keeps teasing me hat I gave him a taste for blood lol but its funny cause now im kinda rethinking it....|`|RPaHObubaa	Yes, but in small amounts. Iron is bad for male rats especially so make sure all the blood is cooked out.  But, it should be fine! As a matter of fact, i just gave my rat some roast like 5 Min's ago. Hope this helped!!|`|EEmvWLCKaa	I WOULD DARE FEED MY RATS MEAT I BREED MY RATS FOR PETS. BREED FANCY  RATS.<br>  NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DO THAT GO TO PET LINK.COM.AU AN ASK SAME QUES YOU WILL GET SAME THING .<br>  DON'T FEED YOU RAT MEAT THERE GET TASTE OF BLOOD<br>  AN YOU DONT WANT THEM START TO BIT YOU. THAT LAST THINK YOU DONT WANT.
