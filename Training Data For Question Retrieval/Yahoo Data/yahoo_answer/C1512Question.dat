My wife and I went out to eat supper last night at a local restaurant we are familiar with. It is not a fast food establishment. I ordered fried cat fish and when asked how I'd like my potatoes I replied fried potatoes.     The new waitress looked puzzled and repeated 'fried potatoes??'. "You must mean like french fries" she continued. She had never heard them called fried potatoes she said. I just said sure give me french fries.    My wife was looking at her in disbelief and then fought very hard to keep from laughing in her presence.    Have you ever encountered this problem. We decided she must have been raised on McDonalds.

20090307174216AAjAb3C	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Neighbours driving me crazy. need help?	okay so I have water leaking in to my (rented) flat from the flat above me.  This first started a few weeks ago so I went up to speak to them but nobody was in.  So i wrote them a note politely asking them to get it fixed and to let me know what was going on. I also phoned my landlord to let them know.  As this point there wasn't that much damage (well any noticeable damage) to my flat.  So a few days later I hadn't heard anything from my neighbors So i went up to their flat again, this time a guy claiming to be a joiner answers the door.  He says he's there fixing the leak (FYI I watched this guy leave to check he wasn't a burglar or anything - he wasn't)       Anyway after that there was no more leaking until last weekend.  This time it is much worse damaging the wallpaper in my bedroom and I'm worried its getting into the electrics in the bathroom.  I phoned my landlords straight away but all they can do is report it to the council (which they have done) who can force entry into the other flat to fix it...but there is a waiting list and my flat is not deemed and emergency.      The thing is, they only run the water at like 1am, and they run it for ages.  what are they doing?!  I went up to speak to them last night and asked them not to run the water until they had it fixed which they agreed to do (though they do not speak great english - maybe something was lost in translation!) but 20 mins later I could hear the water running again.       anyway I guess i would just like some advice or opinions as I'm getting pretty sick of this!

One is Heaven with God and for the righteous ones and obedient angels. the other heaven is Hell (perfect because God created it) with Satan and for the disobedient angels (fallen) and for the damned souls.

If you cannot then can you see that it is your beliefs which keep you close minded that there are indeed  other possibilities.  The sad part about it is that it is just not religious subjects which you have close minds about,   but just about anything which you can throw your beliefs about god or the bible into the mix.  Blind faith can and does  distorts reality.  If this is all BS then tell me why would you think your faith would be lessened if you admit to the reality of those posibities
20090307174547AAxh8mn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	When a girl likes you, why is it that the minute you also show interest...?	She loses interest in you. Like you have become boring. Please don't say people like a challenge. Please tell me why girls are so ******* stupid. Why most girls are ******* *****. Why they say they like nice guys when they only like *** holes.            Above is the main question, but here is the side info if anyone cares. I met a girl (who liked me) at a small party. We had chemistry, I got her number and for a week, we talked more and got to know other better. We had common interests, I had no gimmick, I was funny, I didn't say anything stupid. In the second week, I get the feeling she is bored, after she answers a question of mine, she doesn't ask "What about you?" because she doesn't care right. Then one day, she texts me while she's at work saying whats up. After a 15 min conversation, I ask if she wants to get something to eat after work. Exact words "I'm not hungry today but thanks for the offer." This is obviously a lame excuse that a girl would tell a guy who she doesn't like. I got the hint, I'm leaving her alone now. It's not me. Only every other girl I meet is like this. It's very annoying. Stupid *** females.

Shenandoah University, a traditionally Methodist school, has begun a series of "religious road trips" for students so they can see what other faiths have to offer.  The Rev. Don VanDyke Colby, director of church relations at the university, located in Winchester, Virginia, started the religious road trips last fall with his wife Rhonda, a Methodist pastor and the dean of spiritual life, to help students deepen their faith by expanding it. "A rigorous faith is going to serve them well. A rigid one is going to break when the first strong wind comes along."       http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...     http://www.su.edu/spirituallife/events.c...       As a Unitarian Universalist, I think this is a marvelous thing.  Not only will this disperse stubborn stereotypes some students might have by the benefit of first-hand knowledge and help them better understand their neighbors, but it might introduce students to concepts and practices that will be of benefit to them and of which they otherwise would have remained ignorant.

20090307181528AAp1hj6	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	When people argue about Ancient Egyptians, are they thinking of the whole history or just the very first ones?	You don't have to read the rest of this.  Answer the question above.             I put this together some months ago about Ancient Egypt period, not just the first ones or the ones that migrated to Egypt. Also this could be broken down proving each of Africans in Egypt, Arabs in Egypt and European in Egypt.  So I decided to post this putting eveything I know together.         This question very often, quickly becomes muddled in confusion. Both Ancient and Modern Egyptians were/are Arab Semitic White (65% of Egypt's population) as shall be demonstrated shortly. The "Hamitic theory" has been proven wrong and outdated by DNA(haploid testing) as well as anthropological testing. The Hamites have been described from the whole spectrum of Black to White(both Semitic and Indo European Aryan) to any admixture. About 30% is Black(mostly Nubian, some Nilotic), Black/Arab admixture-the Berbers and Moors are essentially Arabs with 8-15% Black heritage, and 5% all other ethnicities. The confusion comes about because Afro centrists want to claim the Black Nubians/people of Kemet were Ancient Egyptians. Ancient Nubia encompassed the lower Southwestern corner of present day Egypt(annexed in 1520 B.C.), the remainder being present day Sudan. Additionally, there were Black Nubian Pharoahs for an extremely short time frame from 800-700 B.C.. Many of the Pharoahs do exhibit admixture-Black/Arab mix as would be expected when two or more ethnicities are in close contact. Interestingly, National Geographic sponsored three professional team - American, Egyptian, and French to produce busts from x-rays of King Tut's mummy. The Egyptians and French were told whom they were working on, the Americans were not. Remarkably, the three teams came up with very similar looking busts, all three claiming King Tut was Caucasian. I will part with the experts here. My opinion is, King Tut appears of mixed Black/Arab heritage for the following reasons-he demonstrates a pronounced external occipital protuberance, almond shaped eyes, pronounced high cheek bones, scoop shoveled, teeth, and slightly fuller lips than most Caucasian - all Black features. He demonstrates a high forehead, pronounced, narrow nose, lips thinner than the average Black, oval head structure, and a recessed jaw ( most Blacks exhibit non medical prognathism-jaw slightly pronounced) - White features. He was probably of the exact same heritage as Anwar Sadat-Egyptian Arab Semitic White father-Sudanese/ Nubian/ Kemet mother-he denied this until shortly before his death. He always claimed Arab Semitic White.      Afro centrists make the claim Egypt is in Africa, so Egypt is Black. Because one lives in/originates in, Africa does NOT mean that person is Black, but African. A full 1/3 of Africa(North) is Arab Semitic White.      MODERN ETHNIC SAMPLINGS OF ARAB(SEMITIC WHITES) COMPARED TO BLACKS      Arab(Semitic Whites) Americans: Lebanese heritage: Ralph Nader, Jamie Farr(Clinger on Mash), and the late Danny Thomas.      Arab( Semitic White) Americans: Egyptian heritage: Dina Powell, Rami Malek      compared to:      MIXED: half Arab(Semitic White)-Egyptian/half Black(Sudanese): Anwar Sadat      Black Americans: Bill Cosby, Denzel Washington, and Will Smith      Clearly, you can tell the sets of men and one woman, do NOT fit in the same ethnic classification.The late Anwar Sadat, was half Arab (Semitic White)-Egyptian and half Black(Sudanese), many of the same features attributed to King Tut, whom most likely, was also bi-racial.      When Blacks and Egyptians(Semitic Whites) intermarry, Black traits do dominate(i.e.-Anwar Sadat-(Egyptian Semitic White Father-Black Sudanese mother)).      Homo sapiens idaltu, (similar to modern Blacks/N*egroid features) whom had Black features and Cro Magnon(similar to modern Whites/Caucasoid features) whom had White features, lived in Africa about the same time-both forms of Homo sapiens, now extinct-modern humans are a subspecies of Homo sapiens-Homo sapiens sapiens to be exact-so you can not say the first humans were Black or White. Also, the indigenous(originating there) peoples of Maghreb(the term is generally applied to all of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but in older Arabic usage pertained only to the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea), are classified as Aboriginal Caucasoid(resembling/ appearing White/Caucasian). The Ancient Egyptians can no more be called Black than America can be called American Indian for the very same reason-they, quite simply, are NOT.      WHAT GENETIC EVIDENCE IS THERE?      A sampling of ethnicities in Egypt:       http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...       The following link also shows the DNA pattern of Ancient and Modern Egyptians whom were Arab Semitic White, NOT Black or even Hamitic(long outdated and proven wrong):       http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...

20090307180941AAdqHlS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If the 'chosen people' relates to a multitude of religious beliefs...?	If the concept of the 'chosen people' exists within a multitude of religions, why is it only acceptable to ridicule Jews for their concept of 'chosenness' and not others?      Here are some examples:      "Adventists are "chosen" by God to proclaim the three angels' messages of Revelation 14 to the world."      "In Mormonism, all Latter Day Saints are viewed as covenant, or chosen, people; they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ."      "Supersessionism is the traditional Christian belief that Christian believers have replaced physical Israelites as God's chosen people."      "Islamic supersessionism presents Muslims as the only people chosen to carry the true word of God. According to these individuals, the leaders of both Judaism and Christianity deliberately altered the true word of God, and thus led all of their believers down a false path." (Sura 3:71, 4:46)      "There also exist a few Religious Movements that consider themselves to be the Chosen people, e.g., the Indian born Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University."      "Reverend Moon teaches that Korea is the chosen nation, selected to serve a divine mission. Korea, Moon says, was "chosen by God to be the birthplace of the leading figure of the age" (Unification Church)      "In Judaism, chosenness refers to a specific set of responsibilities (613 commandments) beyond the 7 Laws of Noah given to all mankind."

20090307175842AAh9lGk	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I am sick of this injustice..is there any solution?	I am in university, in a 4 year course. I am now in my final year, and without a single friend. But that's not all..i'm not neutral with everyone like i had hoped. I am ostracized and treated in the worst possible manner.  And my classes are not mixed with people from the other courses. Just mine. No matter how nice I be to people, they continue to be bitter to me. I've tried by best and there's no way out in my view. If I am nice to someone  (e.g. giving them a lift), they will act nice to be at that time, and then just backstab me, spread rumors about me (because people in my batch are lame enough to find it fun to talk/listen to stuff about me). If it is groupwork, I won't be informed of private meetings (e.g. at 1 o'clock, we will all go to the computer lab and do the 2nd part of our task), and then they will come and ask me why i didn't ask them when the task is. When I ask them, they will say  that there is nothing planned yet. When I tell them to inform me if there is, they will say that there probably won't be anything but just come along to the comp lab and u may find us. As you see, they don't even have basic respect for me. Suppose they see me talking to people in other courses, and if they end up meeting them as well, they will say things like "why are you talking to him, nobody likes him, stay away from him".   If I sit next to anyone from my class, that person will get up and go to the opposite end of the room, and everyone will start smiling. When I am alone, the lecturer may ask me "why are you alone, why don't you cooperate with the others". I am fed up with all this.   As for my social life...you can imagine. Absolutely none. They don't invite me anywhere.   I asked a few 'almost neutral' people in my class what the problem is. They just said that nobody likes me. I asked them why, then they just told me to ask someone else because they are not supposed to say anything. I asked for names on who are the ones who are trying to destroy my name constantly, then they say that they can't say anyone's name.   What should I do???? And please...counselling is not a solution. It won't solve this problem. The problem here is ostracizm, and I want to know if anyone has any suggestions to beat it.

20090307181905AA8bYCd	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Human Animal questionnaire?	Ok, so there is this relatively big issue circulating around the world: Should animals have the same rights as humans? By animals, I'm pretty sure that they are relating to dogs, cats, dolphins, apes, and other animals that are trained and sometimes brutally beaten for the purpose of entertainment or for pleasure (to eat). I'm not too sure as to whether this fight for animal right applies to minute animals such as insects, so to shorten it i'd like the opinions solely based on the animals I referred to above. Also, the rights that people are referring to are the rights to live a free life and not be abused. I'm obviously not talking about the right to bear arms or freedom of speech! But, I think animals deserve their rights too. I mean we're animals too. Why is it ok for us to eat other animals, but wrong to eat other human beings? I mean its not only morally wrong, but apparently it's morally degrading. People are seen from a different perspective, judged, and even socially excluded, yet exploited by the media. I won't continue with a long story. So to make a long story short, whats your opinion? Do you believe these rights should be given to animals? Why or why not.       This is for a research project. So please help me out. Please and Thank you for your responses.

Our friendship fell apart for many reasons, and some of those reasons are unknown. I feel partly responsible because of how I felt. And I felt I couldn't handle the feelings I had for her, so I ended our friendship letting her believe it was because of how she had treated me in the past. I took it back, and we were friends again, but months later.. it ended again. My gut tells me she felt it too, but we both wouldn't ever think about showing it.       It's been two years since our last fight. I fought to keep her friendship for a year.. but it's not what she wanted, so I let go. A year past and I was fine, but I saw her over a month ago, and it's like the feelings just re-surfaced and I feel like telling her why I wanted our friendship to end, because of how I felt for her. I feel it to be closure, that I never got, because wouldn't ever let me in on how she was feeling about why she wanted our friendship to end. I don't know what to do... What would you do?

She and I basically paired up for the whole night, grinding as one entity (front to front and front to back), stroking each other, holding hands, and giving each other flirty glances the whole time.      Is there something going on, or what it just dancing? The times we didn't work out was basically b/c I was a newbie and she wasn't up for being a teacher. Having now had a serious girlfriend and learning all of the ropes, that wouldn't be an issue.      Is she trying to start something with me, or just being a flirt for the fun of it?

20090227094057AAzQ7Wy	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Prophet Muhammad's Last Sermon?	This Sermon was delivered on the Ninth Day of Dhul Hijjah 10 A.H in the Uranah Valley of mount Arafat         "O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I don't know whether, after this year, I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore listen to what I am saying to you carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today.   O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and that He will indeed reckon your deeds. Allah has forbidden you to take usury (Interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived...   Beware of Satan, for your safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.   O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have right over you. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and comitted helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to commit adultery.   O People, listen to me in earnest, whorship Allah, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadhan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to. You know that every Muslim is the brother of another Muslim. You are all equal. Nobody has superiority over other except by piety and good action.   Remember, one day you will appear before Allah and answer for your deeds. So beware, do not astray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.   O People, no prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand my words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Qur'an and my example, the Sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray.   All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me direcly. Be my witness oh Allah that I have conveyed your message to your people."      assalamo 3alaykom wa rahmato LLAH wa barakatoh .

20090227092547AAUQc7D	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Gem by Imam Ali(AS):?	A person was about to die, and before dying he wrote his Will which went as follows:      "I have 17 Camels, and I have three sons. Divide my Camels in such a way that my eldest son gets half of them, the second one gets 1/3rd of the total and my youngest son gets 1/9th of the total number of Camels."      After his death when the relatives read his will they got extremely perplexed and said to each other that how can we divide 17 camels like this.      So after a long hard thought they decided that there was only one man in Arabia who could help them: "Imam Ali (AS)."      So they all came to the door of Imam Ali (AS) and put forward their problem.      Imam Ali (AS) said, "Ok, I will divide the camels as per the man's will."      Imam Ali (AS) said, "I will lend one of my camels to the total which makes it 18 (17+1=18), now lets divide as per his will."      The eldest son gets 1/2 of 18 = 9   The second one gets 1/3 of 18 = 6   The youngest gets 1/9 of 18 = 2   Now the total number of camels = 17 (9+6+2=17)         Then Imam Ali (AS) said, "Now I will take my Camel back."

He always wait for my call.       One day I tried to see what will happen if I don't call him. When I saw him the next day, he said "oh, did you call because my phone probably was acting up?" and I'll say something like "oh no, I fell asleep when I got home". Then he'll be like "oh".      Also, he always just happen to show up where I am. He pops up suddenly when I'm in the hallway. He pops up in my daily lunch-break spot. He pops up everyday where I leave school to go home.      It's just that I HATE that I always have to be the one to call him and he never calls me.      I once told him to call me and he still didn't call.      He seems so interested in me when we hang out though. What do you think is going on?

Christians, how do you respond to this list of biblical inaccuracies? (part 2)?   12) God makes the animals (Genesis 2:18) and parades them before Adam to see if any would strike his fancy. But none seem to have what it takes to please him. After making the animals, God has Adam name them all. The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a while, why Adam would still have to be living for we haven’t even discovered nor named all the species. Also consider the idea of every living creature being brought to the Middle East, that would have killed many animals due to climatic changes.      13) God curses the serpent, making him crawl on his belly and eat dust (Genesis 3:14). One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps? But snakes don’t eat dust, do they?      14) “There were giants in the earth in those days.” Genesis 6:4 But there is no archaeological evidence for the existence of these giants. Also there is a reference to the “Nephilim” being on the earth. Which is a term used for half angel, half human. Why is there no archaeological evidence for the existence of the Nephilim either?      15) Noah is told to make an ark that is 450 feet long (Genesis 6:14-15). The largest wooden ships ever built were just over 300 feet, and they required diagonal iron strapping for support. Even so, they leaked so badly that they had to be pumped constantly. Are we to believe that Noah, with no shipbuilding knowledge and no shipbuilding tradition to rely upon, was able to construct a wooden ship that was longer than any that has been built since?      16) Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes male and female representatives from each species of “every thing that creepeth upon the earth” (Genesis 7:8). Now this must have taken some time, along with expert knowledge of taxonomy, genetics, biogeography, and anatomy. How did Noah manage to collect the endemic species from the New World, Australia, Polynesia, and other remote regions entirely unknown to him? How, once he found them, did he transport them back to his Near Eastern home? How could he tell the male and female beetles (there are more than 500,000 species) apart? How did he know how to care for these new and unfamiliar animals? How did he find the space on the ark? How did he manage to find and care for the hundreds of thousands of parasitic species or the hundreds of thousands of plant species? (Plants are ignored in the Genesis account, but the animals wouldn’t last long if the plants died in the flood.) No, wait, don’t tell me, a miracle happened, millions of them.      17) All of the animals boarded the ark “in the selfsame day” (Genesis 7:13-14). Since there were several million species involved, they must have boarded at a rate of at least 100 per second. How did poor Noah and his family make sure that the correct number of each species entered through the door and then get them all settled into their proper living quarters so efficiently? I wish the airline companies could do as well!      18) The flood covered the highest mountain tops (Mount Everest?) with fifteen cubits to spare (Genesis 7:20). Where did all the water come from? Where did it all go? Why is there no evidence of such a massive flood in the geological record?      19) When the animals left the ark (Genesis 8:19), what would they have eaten? There would have been no plants after the ground had been submerged for nearly a year. What would the carnivores have eaten? Whatever prey they ate would have gone extinct. And how did the New World primates or the Australian marsupials find there way back after the flood subsided?      20) Noah kills the “clean beasts” and burns their dead bodies for God (Genesis 8:20). According to Genesis 7:8 this would have caused the extinction of all “clean” animals since only two of each were taken onto the ark. So why is it that we still have “clean” animals?      21) God is filled with remorse for having drowned his creatures in the flood. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever the animals see it they will remember God’s promise not to do it again (Genesis 9:13). But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the refractive index of water, and the shape of raindrops. There were rainbows billions of years before humans existed.         This is the second part of a 3 part question, and I woke up this morning to find my questions had been removed.

As he prepares to bury the daughter he still calls his “baby” on Friday, Tolentino expressed no hatred toward Theodore Charles Schmidt, the former classmate at Klein High School who is accused of killing her. He wondered aloud what was missing in Schmidt’s life that allegedly led him to commit such a horrible act.      “All I feel for him is sorrow,” he said. “He has destroyed our family and the people around our family and his own family. I’m not dancing on the roof because they caught him. I feel sorry for him. Maybe he did not have enough love in his life to feel like a whole person. My heart goes out to his family, who is having to live with this as well.”       http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/fron... 
20090227094456AAzTuJz	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do I get my neighbors' dog to shut the #%^ up?	First off, we live in a townhouse complex; thus, there is only a brick wall that divides each unit up. It's thick enough so we don't hear things like music or television, but thin enough to where we can hear that little burden bark all day.      Here's the thing: My gal and I love our neighbors. We're all very good friends. However, one of them tends to be very emotional and can easily hold gudges over stupid crap, e.g., someone parking in her space etc. I've never really seen anyone get angry so fast to be honest. This makes me cautious when talking about their dog. They love that thing; it's like their child. However, I want to beat the crap outta that thing so bad I can't stand it.      They have a lil' chiwawatever. Every time I go over to visit, the dog will start getting all snarly/barky, as if I'm some type of threat or something. And let me tell you this, this little dog can make the horn of a mac truck sound like a mouse fart. I know I could end that thing with one good punt, but I'm not that kind of person.      How can I get this thing to shut up without hurting the neighbors feelings? They have asked in the past if we can hear her, but I replied with a stupid "no", because I'm too light-hearted or something.      Is there any type of sound or trick I can play so the dog will shut up? Maybe something like a shut-the-f%$ up dog whistle? Do you have any ideas how I can gently bring this up without sounding like a puts?      thanks.

I wish I lived in an age when the world was greener, and lives were without needless technology. In an age where people would walk, where there wasnt the kind of rush there is today. An age when people were still relatively nice to each other, with no terrorism. I wish I lived in a time where music was good, not the stuff they call music today.

20090307182501AA2hOPz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it me? Or many are missing the point....?	Regarding the 9 year old Brazilian girl who was molested and got an abortion      1.She got the abortion because her health is in danger (aside from the rape)   2.The ones involved in the abortion decision have been ex-communicated (except the girl)      Though I don't support at all the RCC for the decision, it's absurd the points some people are making regarding the father not being ex-communicated. He wasn't involved in the abortion (which was the REASON for the RCC stand). He committed a crime. That's a criminal penalty, religiously speaking he will get his, but those are not grounds for ex-communication (and don't bring the illogical point that the crime led to the abortion. It's the act itself for the Church. He didn't physically give the ok for the abortion, thus he's exempt from the ex-communication (may he rot in jail)      But what many have not considered is that the MOTHER should be held responsible as well. Forget the ex-communication. That's the least punishment she received. She is just as guilty as her husband for letting this happen.   The girl was allegedly molested for THREE years. Her 14 year old handicapped sister was as well. And the ONLY thing you can think of is that the mother was ex-communicated?   Seriously, THREE years of molestation WITHIN the house and it goes unnoticed?   How can ANY of you support that? How can you miss the REAL crime? How can you NOT see that she doesn't deserve to have her children with her, that she needs to be brought to justice? Three years? Come on! This wasn't the only incident.    Yet you can only speak about this ex-communication.   I feel sorry for the doctors (they don't deserve that, if that's their faith), but her mother? NO compassion from me. NONE whatsoever      Sorry for the tirade. I just cannot fathom some religious people's reaction and the lack of seeing the entire picture from an objective point of view.      Pagan - Mother of 3.

As a German, I'm used to the fact, that the parent's choice for their children's name must be legaly confirmed. That prevents them from choosing a name, that doesn't exist, may be used as an insult, points to the wrong gender or might be a burden for the kid in another way. On the other side, one could say, that the decission should only be made by the parents because the child is theirs. As I heard, in the US, parents are free to name their child how ever they want.   What do you think is more important? Child protection or parent's liberty?

20090227092437AAaCDnG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A good prosperity spell?	The other day my neighbors had their little puppy (this isn't the first time by the way) outside -no food, water, shelter or anything for at least an hour.  Where I live you can only have your dog outside for 15 minutes because if it is more than that then you have to have a dog house and those are not allowed here.       So after listening to the puppy cry AGAIN I decided I'd had enough. I called down to the office and asked to speak with the owner of the puppy (we asked her husband to please take it in and he said no.) and she went off on me cursing and then hung up on me.... So I decided since they weren't going to take care of it at all that I was going to call PAWS. within 30 minutes the lady from paws was at their door, but the husband would not let her take the puppy. So she came back in about another 30 minutes with a 175 dollar fine and then took the puppy.      I thought I was doing the right thing by giving the family the chance to take it in.       The reason I am asking for this is because the lady who works at the office has raised the cost of living here for my parents by 50 dollars a month, the spell is not for me- it is to bring wealth to them to make it easier on them because I know they need it.       I'm wondering though -can I even do that? They do not believe in this stuff so I am not sure if it would work or not. I know they need it a lot, and I feel it is my responsibility since I just cost them another 2600 dollars a year.      If I can't do it directly for them, then I need one for myself. and I would then give any money I get to them.      Please help (;

Dont get me wrong, I disapprove of people who stare at an attractive woman as opposed to look, but its not like I think thats a major crime either. No need to pluck out the eyeballs or summon-up Ali for an Islamic head-chopping.      Ive had this debate with many Muslims. It always goes like this:      "Would you want someone staring at your sister!!!!!"      "I dont care. So long as they dont do anything to her, I really dont care. Nor do I own my sister or think of her in any possessory manner."      "You mean you dont care that some man is staring at your sister!!!"      "I prefer they dont stare but again, so long as its nothing more...I dont care. Shes not a possession. If she cares, then I care, otherwise I dont. The issue is her, not me. What shes ok with."

Any man who claims divine Kingship, if he has not been anointed by God, through the power of the Holy Spirit of God, and He does not prophecy, He is not legitimate and not a true king unto Almighty God..

I had a total knee replacement about a month ago and have been doing GREAT until tonight. I keep having stabbing pains at different areas of my knee and leg.

20090307185707AAXwFrI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My mother has decided that I don't seem like I'm bi...?	Any of the two or so times my sexuality has come up in conversation, she has told me she does not think I'm bisexual. Now, I'm pretty much positive that I am bi, I've had one girlfriend, and I like one of my best friends right now, which kind of sucks, but my first and longest relationship was with a guy, and he was absolutely horrible to me. I haven't really liked a guy since, and my mom thinks I "say" I'm bi because I'm bitter. I know I'm physically and emotionally attracted to girls, but I do suspect that my exbf kind of traumatized me in a way.       What do you think? I guess this really isn't a question, precisely, but if anyone can relate to this, I'd appreciate your comments.

20090307190755AAEM2W8	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Ex-California bookkeeper accused of embezzling $10M.  Your thoughts?	VISTA, Calif. – A former bookkeeper embezzled $9.9 million, forcing her company to make layoffs as she bought 400 pairs of shoes that she kept in a room-sized closet decorated with a crystal chandelier and a plasma television, authorities claim.      Annette Yeomans, 51, surrendered at the Vista jail on Friday and was booked for investigation of grand theft and embezzlement. She was being held Saturday at the San Diego County jail in lieu of $10 million bail.      It was not immediately clear whether she had an attorney.      Authorities allege that Yeomans embezzled the money from 2001 to 2007 while she was chief financial officer for Quality Woodworks, Inc., a cabinetry business in San Marcos.      She spent at least $240,000 on 400 pairs of shoes, $300,000 on designer clothing and 160 purses valued at $2,000 each, investigators allege. She also remodeled a bedroom into a closet with the chandelier and a 32-inch TV, they said.      "On a weekly basis Yeomans would spend $25,000 on her credit card and then pay off the balance the following Monday with company funds," said Sgt. Mark Varnau of the sheriff's Financial Crimes Unit. http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090307/ap_o...       Edit:      It's like every other week someone has committed another fraud or embezzlement.  It's not like this happened "yesterday."  Most of these people have been doing this for years.  For years!  No wonder the economy is all jacked up.  Bernie Madoff, Aurthur Nadel, Marcus Schrenker, Citibank, AIG, Goldman Sachs, Wellsfargo, just to name a few.  This is one of the many reasons why our economy is so jacked up.

I don't know how the rest went except that at some point Adam said "lie beneath me" and the woman said "no." From then on it was either banned because a woman was never known to say no to a man. Well anyway, I don't know what to make of these banned books and how authentic they are, but what do you all know?

20090307192314AA6L0Qu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think the "mathematical miracles" of the Quran Is Cool?	Reminder: This is just a question. Do you think the "mathematical miracles" of the Quran Is Cool?      WORD REPETITIONS IN THE QUR'AN      Apart from the miraculous characteristics of the Qur'an which we have looked into so far, it also contains what we can term "mathematical miracles." There are many examples of this fascinating Qur'anic aspect. One example of this is the number of repetitions of certain words in the Qur'an. Some related words are surprisingly repeated the same number of times. Below is a list of such words and the number of repetitions in the Qur'an.       The statement of "seven heavens" is repeated seven times. "The creation of the heavens (khalq as-samawat)" is also repeated seven times.      "Day (yawm)" is repeated 365 times in singular form, while its plural and dual forms "days (ayyam and yawmayn)" together are repeated 30 times. The number of repetitions of the word "month" (shahar) is 12.       The number of repetitions of the words "plant" and "tree" is the same: 26      The word "payment or reward" is repeated 117 times, while the expression "forgiveness" (mughfirah), which is one of the basic morals of the Qur'an, is repeated exactly twice that amount, 234 times.       When we count the word "Say," we find it appears 332 times. We arrive at the same figure when we count the phrase "they said."      The number of times the words, "world" (dunya) and "hereafter" (akhira) are repeated is also the same: 115      The word "satan" (shaitan) is used in the Qur'an 88 times, as is the word "angels" (malaika).       The word faith (iman) (without genitive) is repeated 25 times throughout the Qur'an as is also the word infidelity (kufr).      The words "paradise" and "hell" are each repeated 77 times.      The word "zakah" is repeated in the Qur'an 32 times and the number of repetitions of the word "blessing" (barakah) is also 32.      The expression "the righteous" (al-abraar) is used 6 times but "the wicked" (al-fujjaar) is used half as much, i.e., 3 times.      The number of times the words "Summer-hot" and "winter-cold" are repeated is the same: 5.      The words "wine" (khamr) and "intoxication" (saqara) are repeated in the Qur'an the same number of times: 6      The number of appearances of the words "mind" and "light" is the same: 49.      The words "tongue" and "sermon" are both repeated 25 times.      The words "benefit" and "corrupt" both appear 50 times.      "Reward" (ajr) and "action" (fail) are both repeated 107 times.      "Love" (al-mahabbah) and "obedience" (al-ta'ah) also appear the same number of times: 83      The words "refuge" (maseer) and "for ever" (abadan) appear the same number of times in the Qur'an: 28.      The words "disaster" (al-musibah) and "thanks" (al-shukr) appear the same number of times in the Qur'an: 75.      "Sun" (shams) and "light" (nur) both appear 33 times in the Qur'an.   In counting the word "light" only the simple forms of the word were included.       The number of appearances of "right guidance" (al-huda) and "mercy" (al-rahma) is the same: 79      The words "trouble" and "peace" are both repeated 13 times in the Qur'an.      The words "man" and "woman" are also employed equally: 23 times.Will they not ponder the Qur’an? If it had been from other than Allah, they would have found many inconsistencies in it.    (Qur’an, 4:82)         The number of times the words "man" and "woman" are repeated in the Qur'an, 23, is at the same time that of the chromosomes from the egg and sperm in the formation of the human embryo. The total number of human chromosomes is 46; 23 each from the mother and father.      "Treachery" (khiyanah) is repeated 16 times, while the number of repetitions of the word "foul" (khabith) is 16.      "Human being" is used 65 times: the sum of the number of references to the stages of man's creation is the same: i.e.      Human being 65      Soil (turab) 17      Drop of Sperm (nutfah) 12       Embryo ('alaq) 6      A half formed lump of flesh (mudghah) 3      Bone ('idham) 15      Flesh (lahm) 12      TOTAL 65      The word "salawat" appear five times in the Qur'an, and Allah has commanded man to perform the prayer (salat) five times a day.      The word "land" appears 13 times in the Qur'an and the word "sea" 32 times, giving a total of 45 references. If we divide that number by that of the number of references to the land we arrive at the figure 28.888888888889%. The number of total references to land and sea, 45, divided by the number of references to the sea in the Qur'an, 32, is 71.111111111111%. Extraordinarily, these figures represent the exact proportions of land and sea on the Earth today.238

20090307192105AAPK2jC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I need some help with my diversity and culture essay?	Being different is the essence of humanity. Therefore it should never be the source of hatred or conflict. The answer to being different is to respect it. There in lies a fundamental principal to peace: respect for diversity. We are all different yet want the  same things for each other: to be respected by others. We should respect everyone that is different from ourselves and respect their beliefs, traditions, values and opinions. In some ways, all these things put together makes us unique in who we are. Therefore we need to embrace our differences and uniqueness.        This is my own experience with diversity. I grew up in a small community in Southern Texas where everyone interacted with one another regardless of our ethnic background.  The community where I lived was of individuals that came from Spanish backgrounds. I came from a mixed background. I have a mexican mother and my father is black. Half of our family and heritage is Mexican and my life has been spent in the sole care of my mexican mother.      There were many times when I would have conversations with individuals who could speak Spanish, and they would hear me speak the language and they would comment on how I could speak Spanish really well. As we knew how to speak the same language, we already knew that there was something in common. I always assumed that anyone who spoke Spanish were of Mexican heritage. This is where I admit that I was wrong. I began to learn about the diversity of the Spanish heritage and learned that it is not only people of Mexican background who know the language, but so many other nationalities as well. As I became more and more curious of the backgrounds of people who spoke the language I know, I began asking people where they were from. I would always go eat at this Spanish restaurant called “Cinco De Mayo”, with my family. One day, there was this family sitting right next to us and I overheard the woman speaking Spanish so I automatically assumed she was from Mexico. But because I am so inquisitive about learning where people are from, I turned around and asked her where she was from. As it turned out she was from Honduras.    This experience helped broaden my perspective about  the diversity among individuals of Latino heritage. I later learned that there are many individuals that speak Spanish but where they come from is different. Places such as Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Cuba, Panama, and Dominican Republican are where the Spanish language is most commonly used. Each place is familiar with the same language but our values, traditions, music and food are different. We all just want to live in peace with each other and be respected for our differences and be accepted by others. I believe that we all can get along with each other as long as we are willing to have an open mind in learning new things about people different from ourselves. However the world would be a more accepting place for everyone if we all came together and accept our differences. We all have something in us that wants to be seen by others and we should be open to the idea of sharing our lives with others. Our individuality and the person we are inside is what makes each and everyone of us interesting and diverse in our unique ways.

People are dieing all over, Dieing for you, dieing from diseases, dieing from starvation, and you complain that life isn't good enough for you and you? What if you never had life? Never had a chance of living before you died? What would to happen if you learned you where going to die in a few months? Wouldn't you appreciate life more? The thing all living things are scared of is Death, and Death is coming. You may think your not afraid, but you are. You throw trash on the only Earth we have? You throw food out when it is perfectly good? You say life isn't good enough for you when some haven't even had a chance of living it? The only real way your going to find happiness is through The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. We where put on Earth to serve the Lord. The Bible is God's word. You've never read it maybe, you may just believe what something tells you. Go to a church, and after wards you may feel a little different. God is real. He created you, me, Earth, carrots, pie, money, everything. You can't get away from Him. I've tried to help you, and you refused. Fine with me. Your in my prayers.      -YourGaurdianAngel

Where do some Americans get these crazy ideas about traveling to different countries? First, let me start off by saying I hate when people make broad generalizations about a certain group of people, so I will just say some. But, when I told my friends that I wanted to study abroad for a semester, I got comments like, 'don't you know when that when you go to these foreign countries you risk getting turned into a prostitute, raped, etc. And, I am like WTH? Where are they getting these ideas from? I have also had a lot of people who have encourage me to travel because their is a world outside the USA. It is just kind of sad that some people are letting their fear or lack of knowledge keep them from experiencing the world. I really want to travel and see all that the world has to offer. Their twisted views and opinions won't change that but I was just wondering why some people felt like that.

20090307194822AAQG1rc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Please help me LDS people?	Does the Spirit ever test you? Like it tells you something false to see if you'll listen, knowing that everything will turn out as it should in the end. The reason I ask is because I was thinking about one of my friends a few weeks ago (we are both LDS) and I very clearly heard the Spirit say "No." And then I felt this peace wash over me and gave me the impression of "Don't be offended. He(Heavenly Father) has someone else in mind for you." I'm trying really hard to listen to the Spirit, but I was wondering if maybe He is testing me. I don't see why my friend wouldn't be the one for me, but I definitely don't see myself as all-knowing or anything. So basically I was just wondering if the Spirit tests you (like, I'll end up with my friend in the end, but for now he's checking to make sure I'm listening).      Thank you

Especially in india, it's fine to beat ur child(or it was when I was young), and  that was a symbol of love, because ppl who could care less about u, won't take the time to discipline you. Then u go and try to make others obey u, out in the world this way. Ur parents discipline u for that too. And of course, when u get married,  the men think they have the right to discipline their wives because now, she's his responsibility, and thereby, they have a parent-child relationship, only, he expects sex too, so technically it's a kind of morbid pedophilia.. But anyway, y are parent genuinely surprised when their kids repeat the same behavior they were used to as children? Sure, the folks can say their kids know better, but when I used that logic  as a kid, to my folks, I just got scolded or hit again.

So if that is really the case why was hell supposedly created?

Just look at celebrity examples at the moment. Obama is married to a black woman, Halle Berry is with a white man, Karyn Parsons is with a white man, and Jennifer Beals is with a white man.      Lenny Kravitz was married to Lisa Bonet, and they're both biracial, but that seems to be it. Vanessa Williams has two biracial parents, and was with Rick Fox, but that's all I can think.      It seems to be rare. From my life experience (despite these celebrity examples), the vast majority of biracial men date/marry white women, and biracial women date/marry black men.       We generally don't seem to date/marry our own.

Assume that the learner is up to this point monolingual in English and that his parents and family are, too. On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 meaning same level of difficulty, 2 meaning that learning Polish is twice as hard as learning German....up to 10, meaning learning Polish   would be 10 times as hard than learning German.   I love languages. I love the different sounds. When I first heard Polish ten years ago, I was fascinated. it has sounds unlike any I've heard in English.

20090307205529AAe4kvc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Things we believe without evidence?	1. The physical universe exists.   we only have our five senses to tell us this is true, but we don't know if they are giving us completely false information (ie The Matrix)       2. Other humans have minds.   we can only assume this by their actions and MRI brain scans but neither one is actually evidence that other people have abstract thoughts.      3. Our memories are mostly accurate.   as soon as we try to confirm this, the confirmation is a memory so we must rely on our memory to prove our memory is generally good.      When I say "God exists and our spiritual sense is mostly accurate" atheists say there's no proof.  Why does this need proof when the others don't?

20090307201138AA8nxNP	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Defining race by individual appearance rather than genetics... Does one group do this more than others?	I hate race labels period (esp. one-race labels for people from two races - it's a practice in segregation), but since they're there, why not use them correctly?       I've heard the words a person IS one race or the other because they LOOK like that race, even if the person has one parent from different races and carries the genetic markers (even those that aren't visible) of both races. If this person were found unidentified, their DNA would still reveal they are of both races. I've also heard they are one race or another based on how they're treated. But that would mean a person from a different race with physical resemblance would be treated the same way. Finally, a person labeling themselves based on what race they feel "comfortable" with, opens the door for miss-classification, medical dangers, and false claim to another race and history. Doesn't it also indicate society needs to change so that a person can feel "comfortable" being who they are (this is where I'm most concerned)?       This is all emotion-based rather than logical thinking.       Do you find people from one race use race labels according to "color", not "content", more than another (for instance, caucasians in America did so with the inaccurate "one drop" rule in the past)? Whom? And if so, why?       Also, since we have DNA evidence that disproves such illogical thinking, why does it continue?

Muhommad and his men attacked the forts that studded the vale of khaybar one by one, all the whiule crying "O you who have been given victory, kill, kill!" One by one the forts fell, until the Muslims arrived at the fort of khamus, which also eventually succumbed. The chief of the Jews, kinana b. al-rabi, and his cousin were led out and accused by Muhommad of concealing the treasure of the Banu'l-nadir. The Jews protested that they noi longer had anything left. Then, Muhommad gave kinana over to al-zubayr, one of Muhommads own men, saying "toprture him until you extract it from him". Al-zubayr built a fire on his chest until he expired. Then Muhommad gave his body over to Muhommad b. Maslama who beheaded it as partial revenge for his brother Mahmu b. Maslama.       I quote from the much revered biography of Muhommad by Ibn Misham.      My question is: Why didn't Allah just tell Muhommad where the "treasure" was? Seriously?

What if you got a letter, but not any ordinary letter; a letter from God himself? Would you keep it to yourself; or would you share it with a friend or even the world? Would that letter change your life or would you still live a secular life? What would you do with the letter, would you read it right away or leave it on a shelf for years to come? Well let me present to you to…..      A letter from God   By: Adam M. Snow      Dear My Child,       My Child why have you gone and forsaken me for this secular life you now live? Don’t you know that I had my one and only son shed his blood upon that tree for you and all my children? My Child I will never forsake you; I am always there for you. You run to me I will run to you; you ask me for forgiveness, I will forgive My Child. It is not mine or yours fault that you live in this world gone cold; it’s not mine or yours fault that you’re living the way you are. Just remember My Child that I will always love you that my son’s blood has washed away your sins.    My Child I’ve seen so much hatred in your eyes towards your enemies. Have you not know that you’re to love thy enemy and not let thy hatred consume you? I know it’s hard to live in this world, but remember My Child that my son will soon return to bring all my children who truly believe in me home.    My Child I have wept for you and for all my children; knowing their fate in this hate filled world. Just remember, I am with you now and always, comforting you through these hard times My Child. Just remember that you always have a friend in me. I love you so much My Child. When you are down, I will lift you up. Just don’t give in to Satan’s lies. Follow me and I will lead you to the path of righteousness.     My Child if I was to knock on your door, would you let me come into your home or would you leave me estray? Just know that you are always welcome in my home. My Child my son Jesus Christ will return though I am saddened for all those who would be left behind. Are you one of those who would be left behind or would I be expecting you in my house? I can not choose for you My Child though you can choose the right path; the bible can help you My Child. I love you so much My Child.         Your Friend,   God      Ps. I forgive you.         You see in John 15: 5 it says, “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” It’s stating that we need God in our lives because if you or I was down without God we would stay down but with God’s help we would be lifted up and sat back on solid ground. It also states that if we stand for God he will also stand for all of us.         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 says "For the LORD himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the TRUMP of God: and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we be forever with the LORD."       Revelations 1:7-8 says "Behold, he comes with the clouds; and EVERY EYE SHALL SEE HIM, and they also which pierced him: and all kindred’s of the earth shall wail because of Him. Even so, Amen. I am the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending, said the LORD, which is and which was, and which is to come, The Almighty."

20090307201036AAoGwN4	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How do you avoid emo haters?	Well, exactly what the title says.   It actually hurts my feelings a bit when people say that emos have to cut and that they're stupid etc...   I was wondering what i should do to calm myself down and how to ignore it. One of my friends (when he's depressed), cuts himself and claims he's emo and that i'm afraid to cut myself so he claims that i'm a poser, not he. He doesn't cut himself anymore (i made him stop..xD) but he still thinks emos cut themselves and he doesn't give a crap about what "emo" used to be and rants about what emo's do today...   Many people dislike, and misjudge emo, how should i ignore what they think of me?   I also understand that you shouldn't say you're emo otherwise it makes you a poser, but even though this second question might make me seem like a poser, but how do you "show" poeple your emo not in looks though...   PLEASE no emo haters answer this...

I mean, I've been telling family and friends that I want to go into law because it pays well. And I really do think that it would be a good choice, seeing as I do want to make money. I strongly feel that I may need to do this. But friends and family say I should be a writer or a journalist. I do like writing, I'm even on my school's newspaper, and I enjoy it. But I don't see how I can make money from it. It doesn't seem like I can live comfortably doing that. And then, there's my dream job- an A&R Representative for a record label. Music is my life, really. I would love to be able to do this, but I know nothing about music except that I adore it. I'm 17, going to college next year, and I think it's too late for me to learn how to play for me to make a career out of it, and I feel that I wouldn't make very much either- the price of pursuing your dreams. So, what do you think?

This girl is hitting the other girls, being rude, obnoxious, talking when she's supposed to be listening.

20090307195455AAdxFrb	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Am I being too uptight about my Chinese immigrant cousin? Am I picking on her?	Hi everyone!    Let me tell you a bit about my cousin who just came from China a year ago. She's been living in my house, has been constantly changing things around and would prefer things her way. For example, I would place all the pots and pans inside the little kitchen shelfs but she would bring them out and spread them out on the counter. I brought them in and she brought them out and this has been constantly going on for 5 months! She would place the little wet dish rags--literally on the counter, to let it dry but what she doesn't know is that they will cause mildew. And let me tell you one more scenario---she would place the vase of flowers, kinda blocking the tv and that would bother me, so I would put them next to the TV so it would not be block but she BROUGHT it out on the open again. Can you tell me what is she trying to do? I am so sick of it. Oh yeah, she would order my siblings and I around too. is this a traditional Chinese thing? And if I tell my mom and brother about this, they would tell me I'm just picking on her when I'm the one who's being picked on.          Note: She's 30 and I'm 26. She came from the countryside of China and I was born and raised in the US. I went to college in US and she graduated from high school in rural area of China.

I needed help with maths homework, and i texted my brother who was at his Girlfriend's house, and i said "Hey i need some  help with maths, can you tell me when you'll be home so i can plan my day?"   He replied "I'll be home at 3ish"   He didn't get home til 4 30, and defended himself by saying how the "ish" in 3ish could be anytime near 3.   SO i was wondering, what do you think is the latest you could get home when you've said 3ish, before it is just concidered late.    Hope that made sense!

Either you are completely yourself, or you put up an act when you're with them. Well I put up an act. My political views, choices, style, tastes, everything is different from them. Anyway, I made what I'm beginning to think is a mistake of adding my siblings and in-laws to my Facebook friends. So now they're kind of seeing the real me and taking it too far. For example, today I became a "fan" of the political film "Religulous". And one of my in-laws freaked and sent me private messages. Just last week another in-law did something similar. A few brothers/sisters join in sometimes as well.    Anybody else have this problem, and what would you do about it? If I just delete them that will be too obvious.

Some christians say that a symbolic interpretation is in order while others say that it is said in a literal sense as a test of faith. I know there are many different ways to see this story. I'm just curious how you see it. I've also heard one group say to another group that they aren't true christians if they don't take all what's in the bilbe as read. Some will say that when Jesus said turn the other cheek that meant to literally turn the other cheek rather than as another interpretation suggests that it just means make peace not war.

20090307181141AAVU7Mm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The devil was the first to quote scripture. Does that make it the word of God, or the word of the devil?	In the gospel story, the devil was the first to quote scripture (he was trying to tempt Christ)      Does this example show that the scripture itself is not the word of God, but the one who is quoting those words can make it the word of God or the word of the devil, depending on their intentions?      And keep in mind, Christ was sowing the word of God long before the new testament came along. I suspect it was a way to increase the light, and not just a book to read... more context on my biography.      So is it the book itself that is the word of God... or the light behind the one who is speaking those words?

20090307173814AAIUQaG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why doesn't the dictionary agree with the bible about what and who uses magic?	Here is the definition of the word magic (mag·ic [májjik]   noun    1.  conjuring tricks: conjuring tricks and illusions that make apparently impossible things seem to happen, usually performed as entertainment     2.  inexplicable things: a special, mysterious, or inexplicable quality, talent, or skill    watched the dancer's feet work their magic       3.  supposed supernatural power: a supposed supernatural power that makes impossible things happen or gives somebody control over the forces of nature.    Magic is used in many cultures for healing, keeping away evil, seeking the truth, and for vengeful purposes.    4.  practice of magic: the use of supposed supernatural power to make impossible things happen)  .Now why is it that you believe that miracles are by divine power and magic is not even though it states it right infront of your noses?  Also  why would you think that saying miracles are not done by magic even though the definition shows they are?

I know I am going to have a lot of people not like this message because they think EVERYTHING they are told is true which makes me laugh (LOL)      It does not take a rocket ancientest to figure out that our beliefs are never going to be all right.

20090307171612AAYGhra	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why when one suggest blacks are the best athletes, that's OK, but if they say whites are smartest it's racist.?	Stereotypes complementary to blacks are completely acceptable, but trying to do the same with whites is racist.        I can make a good argument for the whites, as traditionally they have been the leaders in the world.  Africa and South America haven't done a whole lot to contribute to the good of the world.  At least not comparatively.      I can make a good argument for blacks being the best athletes too.  I played football in college and was a guard (a fat lineman), but every "skill position" was dominated by blacks as they could run faster, jump higher, etc.  Watching them try to learn assignments was not their strong point, but they were freak athletes.  I and other white guys had to rely on intelligence, and fundamentals to compete at that level.

I know it's a silly question, but I'm just curious because I rarely see Asian guys and Black girls date, and I only know one Black girl and Hispanic guy couple.

I'm interested in taking my youth group, but I'm wondering what the sessions are listed on the schedule. I've heard they are workshops, but how would they split up thousands of people? Is it just speakers? I didn't see any mention of dramas, even though they were on the video on their homepage. If someone could let me know what it's like, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks
