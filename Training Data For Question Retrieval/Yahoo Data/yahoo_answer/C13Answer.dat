Z33EyRXwaa	Well that is the long and short of the whole story.  For all we know they may have let her keep them.  Because, if they took them back that definitely would prove that they are in dire straits for money.  Or may be someone's wife or another female in the R.N.C. is wearing the clothes worn b Sarah Palin.  That is my speculation on this situation.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	Sarah Palin did not buy the clothes...a McCain staff member did.  And some were returned and others were donated to charity.  I don't know what charities, but I really don't care.  She got a bum rap with that whole clothes thing.  So I don't really care where the clothes are now.|`|1b835847634639833ab263016ee078fcaa	She returned them to the RNC.|`|wnzK56fiaa	What has happened to all the clothes you ever bought???    She did not keep them.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	it amazes me that palin is still in the news|`|cuIX13BKaa	ARBOB was or is correct to my knowledge. The woman, Ms palin was far too busy campaigning to worry about the clothing....so it made sense that for a VERY possible outcome of her being the next VP....her 'posse' (cracks me up) HAD to be ready for whatever event might come up....yes I too heard that much had been returned.....fac3e it when in the public eye it is important to project a certain Image and hers was just forming at the time at warp speed...i realize that the clothing cost quite a bit...and for what could not be returned, I heard ti was donated to charity...but I really do NOT think that we have en totalle the entire story yet ~ This woman made history...and the wardrobing is never announced when it is a Man's $3000.00 tailor made suit is it? The are NOT inexpensive and must be ready in Politics at all times....I do NOT see that Ms Palin did anything wrong.....She was NOT my favourite by any means...but the point being that this is all groundbreaking so before we bum rap the charities, or who should benefit from this....lets realize that we really did witness history....this question here is a thoughtful one....and I guess...i will keep thinking. Her style(s) seem to be somewhat set. I approve of how it was handled to be quite honest. Clothes cost a lot...especially when they are expenxsive in the first place and then have to be tailored. Great Question....keeping me eyes and ears open for further news.
u3NZ7GnBaa	Being a current BCT 1SG and former Drill Sergeant, when there is mail call all letters that feel like there are photos in them, all packages, any anything that we think may have contraband in it is opened directly in front of the Drill Sergeant, if its a stack of photos we look through them quickly to ensure there is no pornographic photos before allowing the Soldier to have them.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	No one will open his mail.  No one will see them unless he decides to show them to other people.|`|zmmP52P3aa	I'm pretty sure his seargent censors (reads) all mail (at least they used to).|`|e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	It depends...the Drill SGTs do check letters for contraband and when I went through Basic we had to open our letters in a group setting...worse case scenario the DS might ask to look at the pictures and then ask your boyfriend why would a pretty girl want his ugly butt and he might pass the pictures around...so keep them clean...my girl friend(s) sent me pictures in Basic and the DS asked me that question...I told him it was because of a certain part of my anatomy...after he quit laughing he make me do many, many push ups...ahh...good times...|`|vzNgMUdBaa	The people he shows them to will see them. If he's like the typical grunt moron he'll show them to everyone in his barracks.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	If he shows others, then yes.|`|htaxf1jJaa	He'll be the only one that see's them unless he shows them to his brothers in the barracks. Just don't send him anything inappropriate cause if a TI see's it they tend to grab it and what not, so make sure it's for all eyes. My boyfriend also told me to send him a couple pictures, so I sent him 2 of just my face. Only packages are opened and checked, so if you plan on sending him any packages, don't send him candy, sweets, etc.|`|GfUjjF1vaa	I think all in coming mail is vetted...so they will proberly get seen by someone, and then depends what he does with them!!x|`|AA10593735	Usually their pictures and personal items get checked by their CO's (Commanding Officers) so when you send him pictures, just be sure they are pictures that you wouldn't have a problem if anyone else saw.  Keep them tasteful and you'll be fine.|`|F1VXXMrOaa	Don't send anything embarassing to them in basic training. They have no privacy, they will have "locker checks". You don't want to send anything that will draw a lot of attention to them. If a drill sgt sees, he is going to be their personal target the rest of the time. It is fine to send a picture that you would also send to someone like a grandmother. Keep on supporting that man Army Girlfriend!|`|hX7wGgjjaa	when i was in boot camp,the only way we forget about the **** hole that we're all in was to share some mementos back home.showing pics was among those example.before we graduate and meet them finally in person,i can tell them all their marks in their body (including marks in censored area)if there's any that their hiding.and i'm talking about everyone in boot class.no matter how hard he hide the ones that's he does not want to share,it's useless because in boot camp you don't have anything.the drill instructor will empty every bodies footlocker and bags  (whatever you have then they will toss them all in one pile them all of us have only a minute or less to get all our stuff out every bodies pile(all mix up of course). the only way to do it was to know every bodies belonging so all will be in the same page of helping each other so they can finished whatever games their drill instructor were playing.we do it repeatedly(fail of course)but in the long run,whenever our DI's play that game,i grab whatever i get my hands that time and give it to appropriate owner to speed up the clean up.i was with the marines so i can't speak for the army.but that's their way of making us a family.(no secrets).
d8jH5lU1aa	They will only check if you did something really bad like a murder or something close to that but using a fake green card is not in the list almost all illegals do it for their families so they can be able 2 work LOl so don't worry about it and lets hope there is an amnesty=]|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	The Dems have stated "in good standing" do you consider using a fake green card to be "in good standing"?  I know all your illegal buds will, but us Americans do not.  Your really need to go home, and stop whining and complaining about a mess you jumped into with both eyes wide open.  NO AMNESTY|`|WBwlKbLeaa	There will not be another amnesty. U.S. citizens have tired of illegals and that number grows daily thank goodness.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Nobody has promised "amnesty." Ain't gonna be one. Certainly not "when", and not even "if."|`|yTdQUqVRaa	I would certainly hope that 'in good standing' means they would have to go through the same background checks as the people who got in line and came here legally. If I had to provide police records and go through FBI checks, why shouldn't you?    As for the previous answerer - no, they don't just check if you've committed murder. Any crime of moral turpitude could make you ineligible.|`|GmfE8RzHaa	Thats a great Idea!|`|413999ce3344ac9070b2bf70d21ebe12aa	From what i've read if they do an amnesty, illegals will be required to pay fines, go back to their country and wait in line like everyone else til the processes are finished.  If caught will illegal documents, that is fraudulent and could cause more fines and maybe denial of the amnesty for yourself.  How would you like it if someone had stolen your identity.    You think they should overlook the fact that you are a criminal.  There will definitely be background checks.|`|ApFh12Sqaa	yea But it doesnt clear your other crimes. Beside Amnesty will never happen.|`|AA10045620	Sorry, amnesty will not be happening any time soon.    However, if anyone were to check into your background, they would see you used fake documents and ban you on that count alone.|`|wnzK56fiaa	Amnesty won't happen. I don't think they check backgrounds. It depends on what they mean by having a good record.
VDbTD2njaa	Jack it|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Do their job then after try to get laid and drink a lot.|`|JDxpjT34aa	That depends on what their MOS is and where they are overseas. They'll do their job (MOS). What they do when they're not at work depends on what country they're in.|`|VSkcPRDiaa	It depends on their job. Asking what Marines do all day is like asking what do people who work in DC do all day. They all have different jobs and tasks.
JDxpjT34aa	You can go while your on your period. They will briefly check you down there but nothing internally so you don't need to worry about it unless it makes you uncomfortable you don't have to reschedule.|`|F1VXXMrOaa	ouch. I would call and ask.|`|eGQw2zGMaa	You can, but if you're not comfortable about it then don't.  Let your recruiter know.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	They don't do a Pap smear anymore but they will take a peek down there.  Also you will be in your bra and undies to do some exercises so I would reschedule.
A2T9D3Rraa	she is so far to the left that he will have to really scrape the bottom of the barrel to get someone as low morally as her...but that's no problem...the left is full of bottom feeders that can give her a run for her money....its a sad but true fact that liberals abound..and lots of them have Law Degrees and will be happy to screw up the Supreme Court for the rest of their lives...|`|cVEHvqxEaa	I have no idea who will be chosen to replace Justice Ginsburg.  However, I wasn't expecting her to stay long on the Court after the election.  She's been in poor health for sometime.    That's one of the reasons this election was so important.  Obama will likely name at least 2 people to the Court.|`|goHKCuyraa	I'm not worried about this pick as it is impossible to get more extreme left-wing then Ginsburg.  I do pray for her good health even though she was a train wreck as a justice.|`|JthubNIsaa	I expect it will be someone with tax problems or ethical issues too.
hAkGVr63aa	It depends on your age. If you are between 17 and 20, your max weight is 194.  If you are between 21 and 27, your max weight is 197.  If you are between 28 and 39, your max weight is 201.  If you are over 40, your max weight is 204.  I hope that this helps you.  Good luck with your endeavors in the military.|`|htaxf1jJaa	You sound fine. When my brother left for boot for the Marines, he was 5'7.5" and 160 pounds. When he graduated, he weight 130. So if you are a little over weight, it doesn't matter, you'll definitely lose pounds. And if you're under weight, you're going to gain pounds.|`|480393beb0bd8d738e3d33a34301d4faaa	Depends on your branch.. I am Army, 6' 2" 194, and its close for me. So you may probably be over. But, you should still be able to get in, they will tell you to try and lose it.|`|eGQw2zGMaa	Max for Air Force would be 197 for that height
AA10206116	Probably not. More likely, you won't have to pay as much in taxes, therefore giving you more money each payday.|`|cdb58ec09082c219d5a820928a9f856aaa	It is still up in the air whether or not there will be a stimulus check.  It didn't work very well last time, so there are now many critics.|`|ttNa7fVhaa	If you get a check, put it in the bank so your kids can pay off this debt the politicians are running up.|`|OsFluoTZaa	dont plan on it hun
d8BgBgE2aa	well its nt in manchester but its a internet site that sell military equipment to the uk cadet, regular, and reserve forces.    look at www.cadetdirect.com    they sell all sorts from uniforms to back packs. have a look.   they deliver to your door so you wont have to go out for it.
1VaH8D3Raa	Dude   .  When I went into the Coast Guard in 66 I was almost 10 lbs under weight  .  Because i was on the Loveland hIgh school track team   .  And being a runner did kind of take it off me  .  I retired from the Coast Guard  in 86 after I got my self hurt real bad in the line of duty  .  There have been stories told of a recruiter in Cincinnati Ohio that had this man wanting to become a Navy Seal who was 15 lbs to heavy   .  Because he was a  body builder and they say he looked like a muscle with a head on top  .  The recruiter got with the district and faxed a photo of the man and   He got a phone call of  .  Get that man signed up yesterday  .  So weight ain't that much of a problem if it because of your life style   .  Not over eating now because you have a   .  High Metabolism  .  You may be just such a man and 3 lbs is only half a gallon of water  .  I loose 6 lbs when I play 2 hours of racket ball  .|`|91de20c91e1b0ea1a6448022652ff606aa	holy cow, you must have some kind of metabolism!! It foods high in fat and or saturated fat. Most likey you will be able to ship|`|JrrDtwVZaa	The last resort would be to drink a lot of beer and after you drink eat a lot of food, like pizza, burgers etc.
nr96BgWfaa	He'll be putting sedatives in our drinking water before he does that.|`|svqtl73Aaa	100 years, but by then America will be the king of the world due to his actions!|`|IFVrLCNOaa	why would obama want a recount? if he can't stand it and wants an out, he can just show his birth certificate.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	any day now as he realizes he is in way over his pay grade|`|AA11424005	Thank you for getting me to laugh out loud.|`|95gEZ22Caa	In 8 years he can just walk from whatever he does like BUSH did   could recount then and say oh   i lost oh well|`|600367b3135824b97a54e03105e6a6feaa	hopefully very soon!|`|4qnXCxlHaa	Never.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	I thought that he was trying to give US the glory for impeaching him|`|HgKlFEpBaa	6 months and his liberal whiners will throw him under the bus...|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	Neo-Marxists recount nothing.|`|8fc8f123f06a174dff895e68b99d24e3aa	By now he may be wishing there were a few hanging chads he could point to
92jr44kFaa	Without knowing where you will be stationed, it's probably a bad idea to buy a new phone right now.  At the very least, you're going to be paying for a service that you can't use while you are in training, and at the worst, your service provider might not cover the place you're gonna get stationed at.    Much better to wait until you get to your duty station, and buy a phone then.  Otherwise, you might just be buying a very expensive paper-weight!|`|9sfeFdI8aa	I'd hold off untill you know where you are going. Most other countrys cell phone networks (like their home electrical outlets and current) are not compatible with the cell phones we have here. Sometimes you can find someone that can re-program your phone and get you a new sim card, but don't count on it.|`|91de20c91e1b0ea1a6448022652ff606aa	Here is my advice to you  Don't by a new phone yet, use the one you have unless you absolutely need a new one, because its not like you will get to use it at all during basic, and after basic in Tech School you will eventually get it back. Anyways i would wait until you get a chance to talk to people during basic and while and tech school to find out if they have been overseas and what their opinions are. No sense in buying one now with no advice
9tcv3TiWaa	First you need to have your orders changed from unaccompanied to accompanied.  She must undergo an EFMP screening (Medical & dental) to make sure she does not have any issues that require treatment.  If she does not then she needs to contact the Germany Embassy closest to them and what the requirements are for her to come in under her country's passport but your orders.  Some might require a visa, others will not.  You can set up for the Household Goods (HHG) to be moved and a vehicle as well if you wish.  The military will hire movers to come in and do the HHG for you.  The vehicle you will have to take to the closest port of issue.  When she goes to the port she will need several copies of your orders, insurance, registration and if the car has a loan a letter from teh bank authorizing it to leave the country.  She would also require a POA from you.   The military will also pay for her flight, you put in the dates available for her to leave and it goes from there.  You have to get all the paperwork done at your end including housing before she can come in.
AA10283296	Sweet!    They just want to encourage us down their path.    Comfort in numbers and misery and all that.    Our politicians are not bright enough to see that their approval means we should run like hell.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Thats scary as F U C K. Thanks everyone who voted for Obama! *sarcasm*|`|JthubNIsaa	Zimbabwe. The highest inflation in the world. Which is where we will be when hyper inflation hits us in 2 years.  Paper money will have no value.|`|ulzWumWPaa	Wanna see how much I can buy with $100 billion ZimbabweBucks?  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/mul... what it's worth is right there in the pic.     And to get a faint grasp of the amount a trillion dollars is:  http://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PA...
raImBqwraa	The Air Force and the Marine Corps are almost polar opposites, for as opposite as branches of the military can be. If you're even halfway torn, you should probably join the Air Force, because if you're not 100% committed to giving yourself to the Marine Corps, than you're going to be miserable, and both you and the Corps would be better off without. If you decide that you do think you have what it takes to be a Marine, be prepared to be married to it and never look back.|`|B3uch2eNaa	The best thing to do is go to both of the recruiters and ask the same questions. My personal opinion is to go to the air force. The Marines are cool but they give you nothing in return for all of your hard work. Its nice to say "Dont ask what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country", but you need to get something in return for your sacrifice|`|AA10962298	I was in the Marines for 4 years and found it to be a good experience. However, if I were to do it over again I would consider the air force. Comparatively there are more/better opportunities for training in technology related jobs, and you are less likely, at this point, to wind up in harms way. Try to think about what you expect to gain from the experience and what you see in your future.|`|htaxf1jJaa	Well I think I am torn between the two too. I'm thinking of joining either the Air Force or Marines when I'm 18, and my brother is a Marine and my 'boyfriend' is at basic for the Air Force. Honestly, I would talk to a recruiter. The recruiter has the best answers to your questions and can help you decide. If you like to spend time with your family and friends and what not, for the Marine reserves after you graduate, you wait another year and go to MOS school and combat training [my brother graduated in Aug 2008 and is going to MOS and MCT this summer.] If you're active then I think you have a 10 day leave or something and then go to MOS and MCT. for the Air Force though you leave for tech school right after graduation.|`|91de20c91e1b0ea1a6448022652ff606aa	Its all a matter of personal preference and job choice, they is a huge difference in the jobs you will be able to choose from in the Marines and in the Air Force.     I can tell you that in the Air Force, you will know when you will be deployed which is nice if you ask me, nothing worse than finding out all of a sudden your going to be stationed overseas, also I am sure you know, Basic is harder in the Marines, the physical training is tougher because the standards are higher. Also it is longer than Air Force basic training. In the Marines you will be one of the few, and the proud. That can have a sort of pride factor in itself, knowing you will be respected wherever you go.     I am definately biased being in the Air Force, but if you are qualified to be in the Air Force and can get a job you would be happy with, its a no-brainer, Air Force all the way, if simply because quality of living, and family life is the best in the Air Force    Good luck, and hope you get a wide variety of opinions and make an informed decision|`|Ty7VkRDlaa	Being married to a career Marine I am a bit biased on the side of the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps has the longest and hardest military boot camp and is the only boot camp that when switching to another service if you so decide, you will never have to repeat boot camp after.     As for the Air Force it has definite perks (we have lived on an Air Force base before) their housing is nice and medical is good too. I guess it goes down to personal preference as well as what kind of ASVAB scores you have and what jobs you are looking for or are qualified for.     From a vanity standpoint there is nothing more gorgeous than a Marine in dress blues but this is of course is my personal opinion.|`|I4949O8Xaa	If you're a better athlete, sprinter, and want to get into the fray with either assault rifles or sniper rifles, and make head-on assaults, and do a lot of obstacle courses and PT training, and you're good at shooting a weapon, do the Marines.    If you're not that athletic, or if you're better at flying planes than you are at shooting a gun, join the air force.
F2h9clSnaa	OTS, IS basic training for officers. They get paid as an E-5 until they graduate OTS and get their comission.   90 day wonders!!!|`|AA11960937	basic training is the physical part of the service and officer training is the mental training along with other training they have to have both|`|ESlMNY3daa	There is BOT (basic officer training) and COT (commissioned officer training). You get the latter if you are in the healthcare, legal or religious fields. The COT is shorter in length, lasting only 4 weeks vs BOT's 13 1/2 week.
AA11494150	It was not your money. Your only option is to pay him back.|`|w5KFkyGRaa	just tell them that you are getting the money together and will pay them when you are able to but that right now you can't pay them.
TOq7shCIaa	OK, I conferred with my prosecutor on this one.    He believes because the age of consent in both Michigan and PA is 16 this case would not be illegal. It would be ok.    These 2 circumstances BOTH have to be met:    1.) you have to be in compliance with your home states age of consent law    AND    2.) you have to be in compliance with the other states age of consent laws    Also, you cannot travel across state lines for the purpose of sex to benefit from another state's age of consent law, meaning if the scenario is illegal in your state then it is illegal in every state no matter what that states age of consent law is.     Example:  Say you are from florida and the age of consent there is 18. Now there is a 16 yr old girl in Ohio where the age of consent is 16. It is illegal for you to go to Ohio to have sex with her because you violate your home states age of consent laws.    Same goes in reverse. You cant have someone come to you because your states law is a lower age than the other persons state's laws. It doesn't make it legal. You must be compliant with both states laws.    Age of Consent for the U.S: http://www.livestrong.com/article/12483-...    I know it is confusing but that is the law, I hope it helped|`|zmmP52P3aa	To meet, no; to bang her, yes.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Yes. I would hope the girl's dad shoots the man.|`|AA10622097	Yes, very.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Yeah. It is funny when they catch those pigs on "To Catch a Predator", good stuff.|`|j7KytoDiaa	is this a serious question?|`|vzDgu1xkaa	Hmmm not enough info but judging from your statement i would say if you knew the man and have met him before. i would say "yes" because it would be a little okay if you guys loved each other but for sexual reasons i would say yes. it is also very illegal to have sex with a minor which the 16 year old is and if you live far apart, they may have met online, so i would say yes because the girl could get hurt and abused.       final answer: yes, because sex with a minor is illegal|`|6dMXExqvaa	I would imagine.|`|cdBRWbTUaa	Ew.|`|m2E4rLxgaa	yes--you should both be locked up|`|AA10425248	If the age of consent in both states is 16, then no.    Otherwise, yes.  And if the minor comes to the other person, it's even worse, and may land the adult in federal custody.    EDIT:  The age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16 years of age. Teenagers aged 13, 14 and 15 may legally engage in sexual activity with partners who are less than 4 years older.    The age of consent in Michigan is 16.    Federal laws are a bit confusing, but it seems that if it is legal in the jurisdiction where it occurs and where the parties are from, you're OK.  Good luck!|`|2uINYiMfaa	yes.. age of consent is 18, 17 in some places but never 16.     You would go to jail for along time and when you get out you will be a sexual praetor
AA11494150	You do not have enough information. What did they claim you did? Why do you claim you are not guilty? I don't just mean the charge, but what are they claiming is the basis for that charge?|`|yj3GT7jOaa	You can represent yourself in court on a misdemeanor charge.  The Judge is not required to listen to or admit your evidence, if any since you are not a professional part of the legal system.    You are also barred from self incrimination and that make you a bias witness.  You can only answer questions yes or no.  You are not allowed to ask questions to any witness because you are bias.   In the event you are sure you are innocent,  the best you may hope for is the public defender. In that case you will have a prosecutor, judge and you will be represented.  That is a fair trial.   Even if the public defender ask for an extension until you can get an attorney of choice, does not mean the judge will accept the extension.|`|d5348844fa0d0a525f373ae1f2bf3a78aa	well firstly, quit capitalizing ever word, it makes you seem stupid.   and in answer to your question, if you can't afford a lawyer and want one, the court has to provide it.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Take the free attorney no matter how bad and inexperienced they are better and have more experience than you do.  You can tell your side of the story. It is never a good idea to represent yourself at trial.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	You already DID get in trouble, and it sounds like you got convicted.  Why would you go back to court?  Judges don't make offers of punishment without a conviction.  Do your community service, pay your fine, and be done with it.  If you did not enter a guilty plea or get convicted, you are entitled by law to a public attorney if you cannot afford one.  Judges frown on people who try to represent themselves, so you should not do so under any circumstances.
g5FbtzNTaa	Being a deliberate tax cheat and not knowing about it or not being able to pay are quite different.|`|KX1R4OQfaa	He works for an internet blog...      He does not work for our government...    You don't see the distinction?  If not, I feel sorry for you.|`|JthubNIsaa	I don't listen to him. Beside, he is not in charge of the IRS, or writing tax codes and the like whereas Obama crooks are.|`|rkRIYxi2aa	I hadn't heard this.  What is happening with JTP and what is your source?  I thought his 15 minutes was over.|`|Vqe6cvRGaa	Didn't hear about this, please fill me in...|`|4qnXCxlHaa	"Joe the Plumber to advise us? He is a tax cheat just like the crooks Geitner and Dashel.    Why are we standing for this? We're better than this."    You ARE?  ROFL!    I thought Joe the Plumber represented the common man.  Are you saying the Republican party does not represent the common man?|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	You're an idiot and not a very good troll|`|OFA2LAM5aa	The difference is Joe the Plumber is a dumb tax cheat.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	Joe's not up to head the IRS|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Not quite. Joe found out about his tax mistake at about the same time as his famous question. He didn't even know a thing before that. He paid up on it right away. Geitner, messed up on his taxes more then once for the same thing. He didn't pay up until he absolutely had too. That is the huge difference. BTW, Dashel will still be able to get a job even though he is an admitted crook, so why shouldn't Joe also be able to do whatever job he wants?|`|wQ5LKysaaa	Someone who didn't have the $$ to pay taxes on time is way different than a rich politician evading payment of taxes.    Republicans were not nominating Joe the Plumber for political office; he simply asked his own (apparently WRONG) question to the wrong dude, at the wrong time.      Then the Obama campaign used state employees to leak the tax info on him, and he was crucified for $1200 by the media.  This was not some 100K deal.      People like him because he's a regular dude, someone who could be eating dinner with his family next door to us.      Obama-nots, don't pick on folks for Joe the Plumber - in your lingo, they're just trying to "keep it real"
5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Hamas is a terrorist organization, that did much to give aid to Gaza, that's how they got elected to represent the area.  Terrorists aren't very effective at anything besides short term terror.  The don't have the arms or the strategy to fight whatever a normal war has become.  Gaza has arms come to them through tunnels, why not have food come that way?  Why allow themselves to be used they way they are.  Israel may be on two sides of Gaza, but one side is EGYPT.  Why isn't what they need coming in that way?  Hamas hasn't been around for sixty years.  In the sixty years since Israel became a nation, and not a protectorate of Great Britain, they won their first war, and then the '67 war, historically the side that wins the war, keeps the land.  Most people living now in Gaza have never lived in Israel.       You can't say what would happen if Hamas stopped the rockets, simply because if Hamas stopped, it wouldn't be Hamas anymore.  There would be no reason for them to exist if not to attack Israel.  The two state solution is a problem because the losers want to write the terms and say that its non negotiable that Jerusalem is to be in Arab hands.  Thats not going to happen.  When Jerusalem was in Arab hands before, Jews were not permitted to pray at their holiest place, the Temple Wall.  Whatever else you say the Jews have permitted all religions to oversee their holy sites and no one of any religion has been barred.|`|I9FOycm6aa	With any luck, they'll win...|`|gvukdlOjaa	You're only seeing half the issue.    Hamas was created as a result of the Israeli government's 60+ years of oppressing the native Palestinian people and forcing them into the most densely populated piece of land in the world, and then cutting them off from the rest of the world.    The Palestinians had elected a moderate, Mahmoud Abbas, who called for a two-state solution and recognition of Israel, but the Israeli government, as usual, was not willing to be flexible.  In short, the Palestinian people lost faith and felt they have nothing to loose, put Hamas in power.    It boggles my mind how little Americans know about the real situation concerning Israel and the Occupied Territories, but continue to support Israel, when it's extremely clear to anyone who knows about the situation that Israel is the one at fault.    ADDED:  It's EXTREMELY obvious you know hardly anything about the situation, or you wouldn't have posted such a mindless question.  It's also EXTREMELY obvious you've already made you mind up about the issue and are just making a statement in question form.    The Israeli government has made it EXTREMELY clear that they are not willing to do anything to help the Palestinian situation, so many Palestinians feel they have nothing left to loose than to fight back the only way they can, which is currently firing rockets into Israel.    Granny:  One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.      Israel uses state-sponsored terrorism to keep the Palestinians and any other enemies of Israel quiet.  In fact, the worst terrorist act in the region was done by the Irgun Gang, a group of Jewish terrorists, who bombed the King David Hotel in '46 and killed 91 people, Arab, Jew, and Gentile alike.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_...    The funny thing is that the person who carried out the bombing was later the sixth Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin.  Who says terrorism doesn't work?    BTW, your question/statement concerning Egypt and why they don't help:  because Israel told them not to open up their border with Gaza, with fear of military retaliation.  So Gaza isn't getting any food, water, medical or relief supplies from anywhere, unless Israel allows it.    Again, I'm amazed how many people have opinions concerning Israel, but know very little about it.|`|NsbGM74iaa	Because Hamas is filled with uneducated hate mongers.  They're so dumb that they just invaded a UN supply depot which can cause aid to Gaza to be drastically reduced.      I mean there's dumb and then there's Hamas dumb. Rockets aren't dangerous, stupid crazy people with rockets are.|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Peace is achieved after the threat is eliminated.|`|1nt5jpZraa	I thought the answer was already given. They won't stop until Israel is wiped off the map. Tough to negotiate with that!|`|bYv4EtbUaa	First of all, Hamas first and foremost is terrorist organization which has declared loud and clear many times that its single objective is to eradicate Israel AND the Jews who live there (yes, that is correct, they specifically mentioned the Jews in Israel, making them not only anti-israel but also anti-semitic). Israel has every right to defend herself, as she has been doing for almost 61 years. Israel wants nothing but peace, and if Hamas were to accept non-violence, Israel would be able to help the Palestinians and there would finally be peace.

Anyone know what the definition of intelect is?  One who views a system for exactly what it is. How it actually works. Dems are psuedo intelectuals.  Whats even worse,  they know better.  You see,  its simple.  More government programs=more democrat votes.  All the while the government doesnt produce one red cent. It comes from tax payers!!!!

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	For a ground soldier there was NO rotation home until wounded beyond local treatment.  Pulling a unit off the line was ideal after 30 days of combat... but that rarely happened.    I wish I could pull up a 'hard document'... I'll keep researching.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	When the war ended. Or they were wounded.|`|AA12281247	That varied a great deal until after we were starting to win, when they started "rotation" programs. We had a very small force to start out with, especially in the Pacific.  Veterans were essential to teaching new soldiers, but very few units got relief early in the war. Wounded individuals were often used as teachers until fully recovered.|`|BImIMnbzaa	Get serious !   GI Joe wasn't rotated back on a regular basis, if anything he may have gotten R&R duty for a week or ten days.  most of these guys were in for the duration, which means:  they get to go home when the war is over.|`|532deab779a2372a57081cb9271a0d97aa	That depended on your duty a bomber crew had to go 25 combat missions before rotating back home. soldiers on the other hand were rotated off the line as seen fit by the commanding officer but every few weeks was tried for. naval crews stayed for the duration but could get leave if the commanding officer said okay. this is especially true when the ship came in for repairs or overhaul. So it really depended on your situation.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Most Soldiers were duration. That meant that they were there for the whole war, or until they got shot. Now how long a fighting unit stayed at the front is something that is entirely different, depending on the unit in question, the theater that they were assigned to and the availability of reinforcements.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	You be funny. While they did rotate Divisions from the line to the rear there was no set pattern. My Dad was transferred from Attu in the Aleutians to the 80th Infantry Division 3rd US Army arriving 6 Sep 1944. I do know that they were put in the rear in mid to late Nov 44 as they had been on the line long enough they were in need of replacements and then would train them with the Vets as long as possible. They came back to the line just in time to be transferred to III Corps. That was the 4th Armored, 26th ID and 80th ID. This was the 150 mile trek featured in the movie Patton. I think they hit the road on the 19th and entered the line in Luxembourg on the 21st. From that time till the end of the war (May 45) they were on the move. During that time the advanced south to K town, up to Mainz, up to Kassel, down to Wiemar (relieved Buchenwald on 12 April 45) and were in Austria by the last day of the war. I have a S3 map of the attack line they followed.
5KaDHt5jaa	Well, I'm not a Republican, but even I can see that Obama couldn't have been chosen based on his political stance.  There were several candidates for the Democratic spot with near identical positions....and Obama received more than an order of magnitude greater support from black people than ANY of those other candidates.  I'm not saying that it HAS to be because of his skin color, but nobody else will give me a reasonable alternative.      People choose candidates for all sorts of dumb reasons that have little or nothing to do with the office involved.  Reasons like:  race, gender, age, appearance, where they're from, military service or not, religion, etc.  That is reality.|`|SaxjkMbSaa	Psssst --- NONE of those people were MAJOR Party Candidates    The Fact is that    1)  In NO other Election in US History did ANY ONE race vote as a common block for ANY ONE Candidate ( who just HAPPENED to be the SAME RACE )  as Blacks did for Obama    2) In NO other Election in US History did MORE BLACKS turn out to vote than they did for Obama    3) If 98 % of ALL Whites had Voted for McCain ( like 98 % of ALL Blacks DID vote for Obama ) they would have been considered  to be racists.....So WHY aren't the 98 % of ALL Blacks who voted for Obama & against McCain considered to be racists ? ( crickets )|`|PwR7SWbCaa	Did they all promise you and tell you what you wanted to hear? Was the media in the tank for these canadiates as well?...did they promise you checks in the mail?

Though I would have voted for Dizzy Gillespie.|`|I4949O8Xaa	THEY DID    But none of the white people did, that's the difference.  Also, back then most blacks were still afraid of getting to the polls.... and the politicians never were a "fad".  Obama, being a superstar, reached EVERY BLACK PERSON EVERYWHERE even those who don't have TVs.  So more blacks actually got out and voted this time, because the Obama-mania reached all of them.    PS I learned something today:  Bush being called "chimpy mchitler" can now be transferred to Obama, for 2 reasons:    1) Hitler was actually a member of the "national socialist german workers party".  Therefore, he is closer politically to Obama. aka lib.    2) Obama looks much more like a "chimp" than Bush does.  In fact, he looks downright ape-like, if I may say so myself!    3) It's only fair that Obama be called this, since Bush was called it for 8 years.  Obama fits the criteria better, and likes america less.  let the hating begin!|`|BfFI7TUsaa	THANK YOU BECAUSE THE MORE THEY LIE THE MORE WORSE THEY LOOK !!!!!!|`|PyG4Vhp5aa	Because number 1 these people idn't get to the final 2 canditates also did these people lie to the people of American saying Change is On the Way and you will get money and world peace and did they mention Obama is relasing terriost and I hate Obama|`|ymCX4zuOaa	YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.|`|PQGg6FElaa	Just to cite a few reasons, Jesse Jacksons scares both blacks and whites because he wants to cut balls off people, Larry Holmes was punch drunk, Al Sharpton does not care if you are black or white he is just a racist towards all, and the number 1 reason why none of the above were elected, they didn't and still don't have the medias interest at hand so the media didn't treat them like rockstars and lift them up so high on a pedestal that they were worshipped like Jim Jones on a sunday morning sermon.
a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	Arabs armed with 'sticks & stones' ?? Again, someone who doesn't know their history... Egypt, Syria, and Jordan were armed with the best Soviet equipment of the day for the 1948, 1967, & 1972 wars.    Now on to you question...  Until the Royal Navy gets their new carrier, I'd put the money on the Israelis by a hair.  A blockade would put the RN under the range of the IAF.    In the OPEN water, I'd give it to the RN because the Israeli Navy is a coastal force.    EDIT:  The Israeli's have no submarines ??? Gee, that would be a surprise to the crews of the 5 Dolphin Class boats.    And the Sa'ar 5 class may be "corvettes" rather than destroyers, but they're top of the line.    And to the whiner...

Conclusion....Royal Navy would knock down the Israeli Navy so bad, they will wake up and realize how much of an insecure, weak bully they really are.|`|44AkhdRnaa	The Swiss navy would carry the day!|`|AA11097492	Please... are you kidding?    Israeli Navy. Patrol boats, primarily. No submarines, no destroyers, no frigates, no aircraft carriers or assualt ships.    The Royal Navy, albeit greatly reduced thanks to numerous spineless governments over the last forty years, could blockade Israel with relative ease. Although at present it would probably need to withdraw units from other tasking to achieve it.    Mariner.... Israel would also be within the range of any aircraft the RAF might choose to place at RAF Akrotiri. I'd suggest the IAF might have their hands full with that one. I'd also like to point out that at no point did anyone ask anything about the IAF. I believe the question amounted to 'Navy v's Navy.'    Edit -  by whiner, mariner, I assume you mean me. Clearly your definition of whining is a tad lower than mine.     I concede your point about submarines; however they'd find themselves pretty well stuffed by Type 23 frigates using ASW Merlin helicopters and towed array sonar. This sonar is good enough to find Los Angeles class submarines in the middle of the Atlantic; it would have absolutely no problem with diesel electric submarines in the eastern Med.

But he is putting in that stipulation for future bailouts.    ... Personally, I think he should ask the Hollywood elite to "be more patriotic" and give up their mega salaries for the sake of the Obama socialism express. While we're at it every one of his tax-dodging appointees should be asked to return 10-fold what they "accidentally" forgot to claim.

I4949O8Xaa	I'd just advise not to fly the confederate flag while you go in for the interview, brotha.  That's like being gay- you have a RIGHT to do it... but considering no one in america supports it, you'd be better off liking the confederacy in SECRET.      However, unlike gay rights, I actually DO believe that the confederacy was right on just about everything EXCEPT slavery.  The people who bash the confederacy are unintelligent and ignorant, as they don't realize all the good ideas and all the good culture the confederacy had.  Just because we freed the slaves doesn't mean we need super-high taxes and big brother government!    ==================    IN LIGHT OF THAT, I still would advise you (for your own damn good) to simply not wear the shirt.

They will also ask whether you are part of any organization involved in trying to overthrow the US, which hopefully you are not.|`|VpfSbqhVaa	Fly the flag on what? they won't break your balls about a licenses plate or something. It's not like they go to your house or anything, so if it's in your yard, no worries. They won't allow racist tattoos, but it's not a lit cross or anything, it's kinda in that gray area. Maybe if you have a tattoo just put "heritage not hate" under it or something. However if you are a racist, you'll be shoulder to shoulder with blacks, and may even have a black drill instructor screaming in your face, so maybe the Army isn't the place for you.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	Johny Reb eh?|`|i1qZER3Uaa	yeah they will take you, as long as you dont have any connections to extremist organizations.

Stop the drinking, honey.|`|wlbuy2xWaa	if it was as bad as you say it was I would clean house with their ***|`|AA12177973	Police are trained to use something called a "FORCE BAROMETER" when dealing with suspects.  Officers must use only that amount of force which is necessary to overcome a suspect resistance and affect the arrest.  The force barometer goes all the way from verbal commands to lethal force.    If a suspect does not resist physically, then no violent physical force should be used against him.    In short, if a suspect doesn't fight the police, he gets to go to JAIL, if he does fight, he gets to go to the HOSPITAL before he goes to JAIL!|`|P1oLYKzGaa	Well, you see just because criminals break the law, that does not mean that the police do.  The police have rules and guidelines to go by.  Nobody is above the law, even the police.  The police can only attack, either in defense or if their life or the lives of others are in jeopardy.  If I cop hits or shoots a criminal for no reason what so ever, then he/she might as well sitting the jail cell next to the criminals.  The main difference between the good guys and the bad guys, is that the good guys don't stoop to the level of the bad guys.  I am sure there are plenty of times when a police officer does want to just hit somebody, but they can't.  Cops have rules, Bounty Hunters, do not!  Bounty Hunters can use whatever force the deem necessary, the police can't.  There is also the rule that everyone is innocent until proven guilty.  How do you think a police officer would feel, if he did walk up and hit somebody who he thought was breaking in to store, only to find out later, that it somebody else did it?  Cops don't make the law, they enforce it.  On a second note, stop drinking.  Or the day will come when you are busted and you will regret it, for the rest of your life!|`|4BBjhHAnaa	It is funny how sometimes police use no force, and then other times they use excessive force and are even abusive!    It depends on the cops, the precinct, the crime, and the criminal.    Personally, I think it is best to use as little force as possible when arresting someone, but for punishment, once convicted, to be *brutal.*|`|AA10628838	Not all police are gentle, and the prisons are full of people who were so stupid as to think they were.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Cops today have to be care full how they talk to people  .

Uhm...actually police are trained in dealing w/ ALL situations, so they most always know what they are doing. Of course, there may be instances where some rookies can be overzealous or underzealous or other cops not following protocol. Generally though, the majority know what they are doing. You don't & you weren't involved, so why are you so pis$ed? Maybe the police didn't find "yobs" whatever the h3ll that is to be a threat to the fish & chips guy. *shrugs*|`|vzDgu1xkaa	If you are a new cop, you try to be nice to everyone. after you are on the job for about 15 years you are tired of these punks and get angry. not all police are going to come in shooting to a local dispute. And not all police are nice. maybe you just saw some very patient cops. some take a guy off a bycycle and beat him down with nightsticks because he was in a no-cycling zone.they aso make lies and are sometimes dirty. they dont respond to calls and say fkkk them. so my answer would be not everybody is the same in the way of handleing stuff. if you want to ask me just email me or im i dont care.|`|I4949O8Xaa	That's true, as long as the people have a right to be free and undisturbed if they obey the law.... the police should have THEIR rights to protect the peace, even if it means fighting back if necessary.  Depriving the police of this law only encourages more crime.    It's like gun control.
6OLiuM9Gaa	It happens to almost everybody.    Whenever one makes a major life decision, one begins to have regrets. Most of the time it comes when you make a major purchase... like a house or a car. For that reason it's called "buyer's remorse."    Like when you purchase a computer. You know that six months from now a newer, faster, better machine's going to be on the market. the one you want's going to be obsolete. You might find a better buy at another store... or maybe there's going to be a sale in a few days....    It's going to happen when you start college. It's going to happen when you get engaged... and when you get married... and when you find out you're going to become a parent. It's going to happen when you buy a car... probably every time. It's going to happen when you buy a house... probably every time. It's going to happen a lot in your life. You can't let it get to you... or you're never going to accomplish anything of any importance... to anybody.    Even General George S. Patton experienced it... even on the battlefield. Here's what he had to say about it. The time to take counsel of your fears is before you make an important battle decision. That's the time to listen to every fear you can imagine! When you have collected all the facts and fears and made your decision, turn off all your fears and go ahead!     If you want to wimp out... if you want to go back on your word to your country... if you want to be a quitter.... then do whatever you think you need to do to get out.     Or you can be a responsible adult... or at least act like one.|`|axeuS4zJaa	I don't think you'll pass the intelligence exam required.|`|F0sQ18MKaa	I dont envy your position right now.

Just how does he think that will keep the Govt from "screwing us over?    As for Che,Che was just a Murdering Psycho with a "cause".Thanks to Che the people of Cuba have lived in virtual bondage for decades now.Che is one of those people the world is better off without.    Malcolm X started out as a hate-filled separatist essentially,most of his rhetoric had very little to do with seeking equality,and a lot to do with his personal hatred of Whites.He did sort of tone it down shortly before his death,which was probably why the Nation Of Islam Assassinated him.    As for the Govt,they are what we make it.Over the last few decades we have given it more and more power over our lives.Mostly due to the wishes of a bunch of whiners who want the Govt to take care of them,and all their needs.The only problem with that is,that a Govt that gives you everything can take everything you have.Our current Govt is so utterly corrupt,that nothing short of starting over from scratch can fix it.The good thing about that is that we outnumber them by hundreds to one,it's just a matter of when we decide we want control back.

My ex-wife has custody of my daughter yet her CPA neglected to properly document her income with alimony in addition to child support.    I was audited by by the IRS and able to show the error. Unfortunately, she had to pay the penalties.    None the less...they do watch those types of issues closely.    Notify the IRS of the problem. Provided you care for your children for over a six month period...YOU get to claim the deduction...not the ex!    As for Matt's response...some people don't understand...it's about TWO people having a child therefore TWO people must share the responsibilities. When you care for the child, it costs more than what you get in child support! It's sad to see how some people are!|`|8GgZBPyEaa	I agree with the other answer. call the IRS and say he has being cheating on his taxes|`|20LnuCejaa	Besides the other answers, telling you to call the IRS, you should also claim your children on your taxes.

They will then go after him for back taxes plus interest.

Today 8 out 10 Native Americans are of mixed blood.  They are in the verge of extinction and we need to take more action.  Today there is little or no freedom of religion and therefore freedom of speech in public schools because it is illegal there for God can't be talked.

LJTvGfU0aa	It depends on what you join the RAF as there are commissioned and non commissioned personnel serving in all branches and trades within the RAF.  The RAF careers office is the place to start and if you have the appropriate qualifications you may be suitable to undertake selection tests to become an officer, these tests take place at the OASC RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire.  Competition for promotion in the RAF is very tough and is largely based on merit and ability to do your job along with additional duties often for the benefit of those in the RAF or for the wider community.  You may turn out to be exceptional and therefore reach the highest ranks i.e. Group Captain/Wing Commander or you may remain as a Flt Lt and move no further.  Your future is in your hands.|`|HOdisPCWaa	What makes you an officer is not the job but selection and passing out at Cranberry officers training.

BImIMnbzaa	Depends on the country in question.  I haven't exact numbers for the US losses, but it could be as high as 460,800.  Yet, the American Civil war had even greater casualty numbers.    The over all loss of lives, both civilian and military, during WW II,  was estimated at between 50 million and 70 million people.  These are estimates, the real number will never be known.

Thank you for writing in opposition to the nomination of Timothy F. Geithner as Secretary of the Treasury. I appreciate hearing from you.     Shortly after President Obama nominated Mr. Geithner to fill the position of Treasury Secretary, we learned that he had made tax errors in past filing years. Members of the Senate Finance Committee questioned him about these errors at his confirmation hearing.     During the hearing, Mr. Geithner apologized for his tax errors. He has submitted the payments he owed.  I believe that his mistakes were unintentional errors and one of many factors to be considered in judging the totality of Mr. Geithner's nomination.    On January 26, 2009, the Senate voted to confirm Mr. Geithner as Treasury Secretary. I supported Mr. Geithner's nomination because he has the skills and experience vital to addressing our nation's hemorrhaging economy.     I believe Mr. Geithner will provide the strong leadership the Treasury Department needs to tackle the current financial crisis and put our economy back on the road to recovery. Thank you again for contacting me. Please feel free to keep in touch.     Sincerely,   Richard J. Durbin  United States Senator  RJD/ms    I'll probably get a response about the "Porkulus" bill, a month after it's passed.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	I have written then and told them this is not a time for petty politics it is time to support our President and get the job done.

They voted in someone who had achieved nothing except getting people to vote for him, and who had never held any serious leadership position in his life, as if they believed that voting him into office was magically going to turn him into an achiever.

Now, we'll see what Obama does about the whole situation, if anything.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	we had the industry in WW1 and WW11  oh   shucks we gave it to China...... so who do think will benefit in WW111|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	WWII money was made selling American Made goods to the other countries involved in the war.    In these wars now.  We are on our own.  We are not selling anything.    Money goes out, but no money comes in.    We had rationing in WWII.  People sacrificed and gave to their country.  We had a common good then.  Now we have nothing in common except the ever elusive dollar.  Everyone wants more money and could give a crap about his fellow citizens.|`|11dGXLchaa	War will only stimulate economic growth if:  (1) the war puts pressure on domestic industries to increase their capacity;  (2) there is foreign demand for our products after the war to help in re-building and such re-building is not entirely U.S. re-financed.    Otherwise, war is just an enormous economic drain.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	The two wars you refer to are not all-out wars.  They have not stimulated manufacturing because they are being fought with material that had already been built.  Also, since we are not fighting an enemy nearly equal to us in military might, not as much of what we have is being destroyed and needs replaced.    An analogy would be this is like a girl on a date.  WWII is like taking her to a fancy, expensive restaurant, and our current wars are like taking her to McDonald's.  Which one do you think will stimulate her and get her in a romantic mood more?|`|AXNkmdbKaa	The two you speak of are police actions.  World War II was a genuine war in which we tried to destroy an entire country, not just the "guilty".|`|DiDCG9UBaa	You make a very good point (better then you may realize). The real question should be where has all that money gone?|`|FX4WhQtKaa	because government cut the defense budget...if you remember history....factories went into overdrive making defense machines,  the current democratic congress voted to cut defense spending.....2 years ago...till then we were thriving....remember?.....|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Simple. Unemployment was above 25% during the depression... and the war created whole new industries revolving around building things for the war effort... it put virtually everyone to work.    These wars have already been provided for. These new industries never went away... we have been building our weapons and equipment all along... so, it did not do much to produce many jobs.|`|DgmlkNsIaa	Quite a difference in manpower and material needs, read the history of WW2 and see what an immense mobilization this country succeeded in doing|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	OK, OK, it wasn't just the fact that their was a war, but rather that the US government had to literally take over all major industries and force them to contribute to the war effort.  The war created a large demand for military goods, which created a large demand for labor, this put people back to work and generated incredible profits for those companies.    The two wars we have currently aren't creating the same scale of demand for military goods, therefore they aren't creating the same scale of demand for labor, so people are still unemployed, and companies aren't making incredible profits.  Halliburton is making good profits, but they left for Dubai and that money doesn't make its way back into the economy as well.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	the two wars were basically over in a short time,we didn't need to mobilize our entire country to supply our troops,if you don't understand the sheer magnitude of what happened for WWII they you will never figure it out.FDR did nothing but prolong our economic mess. btw,both problems were caused by the federal reserve and were 100% done on purpose|`|tOZoDjt8aa	WWII brought us out of the depression because it created jobs and there was a huge demand for weapons, military vehicles, and other military supplies in countries such as Britain and France.    There is no big demand right now since we are not in a world war. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are not helping our economy, and if anything they have a negative effect.|`|bZzXKsJlaa	But World War Two didn't bring us out of the depression as many people think it did.    Economic indicators can be misleading.  World War Two did reduce unemployment, by drafting 22% of the young unemployed workers of the United States and shipping them overseas.  When there is conscripted labor for high risk and low pay, such as in any country where there is slavery, there is never an unemployment problem.    The factories were buzzing, true.  They were not making consumer goods, they were making war goods, consumed only by the government.  People were still not able to afford many of the nicer things in life as happens in a booming economy.  There was rationing of all goods, one of the two ways to determine who gets scarce goods.  Since there were price controls the only way to equitably distribute goods was rationing.    The Great Depression didn't actually end until after the war, when government spending greatly declined.  By that time FDR had passed away and those who had investable funds felt safer to invest in productive enterprises.    War is always a drain on the economy.  While some people do indeed profit from it, they do so at the direct expense of many more people.

They did stuff they probably weren't supposed to, but it was all in the name of discipline. So if you mean to ask What could you do that would embarrass your boyfriend in basic? Heres some guidelines from someone who's been there. 1)Keep it simple. Plain white envelope and grown up stamp. i.e. no cartoons. A Mickey Mouse stamp cost me 100 push ups. 2) Follow his address exactly. Use rank, last name first and first name last. Write it EXACTLY as he gave it to you. 3) If you send pictures, they will be looked at by the Drill Sgts/Instructors. Make sure they aren't cutesy or silly. Especially if he's in them. 4) Don't feel bad if he gets dropped(does push ups) for your letters. Drill Sgts are supposed to be mean. Its what they do. Every letter we got cost us. Its a tool they use to get us into shape. So if you follow these hints you'll be fine and your BF won't pay too badly.

A nivel politica sucede lo mismo que en una empresa o en un peque?o emprendimiento.  El pueblo, el empleado, etc.  solo tiene una visin parcial de la situacin y a veces ningun conocimiento de como resolverla de la manera adecuada, lo que hace que cualquier medida que se tome, por buena que resulte para el pais, empresa, etc. sea muchas veces incomprendida y hasta que tomemos algunas medidas en contra para evitarlas.    Un ejemplo sencillo:  -Mi hijo de 6 a?os quiere una bicicleta de las mas "cool" que haya.  -La bicicleta es cara  y yo tengo que pensar en el bienestar de toda mi flia. y en todos los sentidos. (salud, comida, vestimenta, educacin, etc.)   -Encuentro que no tengo manera de gastar tanto dinero en la bicicleta y le compro una de menor valor.  - Mi hijo queda desconforme, probablemente pensando que no lo quiero demasiado o lo suficiente.  -Sera que realmente tenia una manera de que l comprendiera la situacin? Con 6 a?os y sin la capacitacin suficiente como para entender? Sera que otro chico de 6 a?os reaccionaria igual? seguramente, no.  Y yo todavia tengo la oportunidad de sentarme frente a frente con mi hijo y dialogar, de poner la explicacin de acuerdo a l "fulanito de tal".  Intenta explicar la desicin a 40000000 de chicos de 6 a?os al mismo tiempo.    Por todo esto es que resulta muy importante nuestro voto.  Y solo como aclaracin, tambien resulta muy importante nuestro control.  Que hay malos...por supuesto.....que hay buenos....pues tambien.  Lo dejo para que reflexionen.

Luckily they are wrong about most things and they lack credibility (just like in 2007 when they said there was no hope for Iraq and that the Surge would fail on all counts, but it's worked and Iraq is slowly pulling itself together) with the American people.    I think Obama has screwed up by not putting a cap on spending when he told the Democrats to get to work. They went insane with the pet projects, and only 5% of the Stimulus has to do with roads, reconstruction, bridges and other infrastructure, but that's what Obama  has been selling.    Basically the Democrats screwed things up and he looks like an ***. But I'm not going to say he's using scare tactics, because most Americans and most members of Congress (Rep. and Dem.) say that some stimulus is needed. They're divided on the size of the bill and what mix of spending and tax cuts.

hLWy1evQaa	Some would say it's up for interpretation. Hitler was a very charismatic public speaker and leader, and the Germans loved him.     However, I would say, without a doubt. The conditions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles essentially put all the blame for WWI on Germany since she was the only country which could really bear the brunt of the financial burden. All the other countries were too poor and poverty stricken to do much.     The conditions stripped Germany economically, militarily, and politically. By the 1930s, when the US was in her economic slump, many Germans were just as poor, just as hungry and downtrodden the rest of the world. However, they could do little about it because of the Treaty of Versailles.     By the late 20's early 30's, Hitler seized upon an opportunity to lift his country up. He reinstated a sense of national pride and in actuality, helped the country recover economically through various policies. The German people loved him and that's how he was able to get away with persecuting the Jews. Through the love and respect of the German people, he slowly rose in power without them noticing and was able to build up the army and Nazi party.     Any who opposed him were crushed and by that point, the nation was brainwashed in to viewing him as the Savior of the Motherland. You should check out Valkyrie, that new Tom Cruise movie because it explores the German resistance. There's also a History Channel segment on the movie that gives historical background as to why Hitler was able to get away with what he did. It took years for the German people to acknowledge what a monster he actually was and to recognize the German resistance as heroes.     On a more current note, serves as a warning for any future leaders who are viewed as "saviors" and who are going to bring about change. We need to be wary of too much admiration and too much power.|`|lVKwnFvjaa	Yes, because the reparations Germany was required to pay all but bankrupted the Country.  Inflation in the 1920's reached 10,000 percent per day and money was worthless, other than for the recyclable value of the paper.    So if a person wanted to buy, say, some bread and milk, he/she would take as many banknotes as possible along to the grocery store, the money would be weighed and the value of the paper calculated.  If the weight was sufficient, the person would get his/her groceries. If not, no bread and/or milk.    To guard against a repeat of this sort of cycle, and the possibility of a third world war occurring for the same reason, the allies decided after the second not to require harsh reparations, and also to contribute to the rebuilding of both Germany and Japan    Try google for sites with more information.|`|AA11433998	You could say it did help, but without it he still had plenty of other things to rant about on his rise to power.|`|FLDgvm3kaa	Absolutely. If there hadn't been such harsh conditions forced on Germany, there is a possibility WWII wouldn't have happened. Hitler had things to scream and rant about, Germany was mad because they were bankrupt, and then nobody tried to enforce it when Hitler started going past the boundaries.|`|94hXoyWCaa	Yes The conditioned placed on Germany after WW1 by the U K and the French with out question led to WW2 America signed it's own peace treaty with Germany  What most Brits don't know or don't care to know is after WW2 the U K asked for reparation from Thailand [yes Thailand declared war on the U K] The Brits wanted six million tons of rice and to place military bases in Thailand The U S of A put a stop to it  In WW 1 they could not of won without the U S  The U K did next to nothing to defeat the Japanese and yet they asked for war reparations for both But of course we all know they won the war in Europe  The U K also asked for war reparations from Japan for it loses in Malaysia but none for the Chinese loses    For the post below just what other country besides the U S helped rebuild Germany and Japan?|`|Zdt2qM8Uaa	Yes, the Treaty of Verailles was made by France and England and put all blame of the war focused on Germany. Which made Germany accept all blame for the war, split up their nation, limit their military size, and put Germany into a poor economy. So then, Hitler used the Treaty of Versailles to reunite all the Germans and try to get what the treaty took from them.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	Yes. The treaty fueled the need for a strong leader who would improve Germany's status back to Pre-WW1 days. It just so happens Hitler make the right decisions at the right time to get in position to become leader.    *No one had any idea he was going to do the Holocaust|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	Yes... It p*ssed the Germans off, so they looked towards the extremist Parties for somethng to be done (Communism or the Nazi Party).|`|cEFiOrX5aa	Well, yes and no. No because they did not necessarily foster the same opinions that Hitler had all across Germany at once, and yes because it gave Hitler reasons to desire power, and once he gained power he used his hatred of this treaty and those who signed it to sway popular opinion over time.|`|BgClmJb8aa	Yes the treaty of versailles was one of the many blows germany received allowing extreme parties, e.g. the nazis and communists, to get into power.  Actually changed, my mind slightly, Hitler would bot have got into power without the wall street crash because as Germany were on the mend from hyper inflation (caused by the reparation pays in the treaty of Versailles) that happened and the USA demanded loans putting Germany into poverty again, allowing extreme parties to rise into power, it all connects together really, although I'd say the treaty of Versailles was the starting point
yAsLhdp2aa	reversing Roe V Wade will not make abortion illegal..it simply defederalizes abortion (takes it out of the taxpayers pocket) and leaves the legislation up to the states...opposed to the federal government. the only constitutional authority our government has is to coin money..make freeways and provide military defense..everything else is suppost to be left up to the individual states to decide. Claiming that abotions will be banned is pure media spin..aimed to make the citizens debate over something that doesnt actually exist.. it takes the real attention off of the bankers and corporations that have taken control over our county..it is fear mongering and distraction at its best.    Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) even supports the reversal of her own court case.  The taxpayer should not be funding abortions...period.  If you want an abortion..that is fine, discuss it with your doctor and pay for it yourself.|`|AA11313983	By your logic, rape should be legal, as people do it even when it's illegal.  So should armed robbery, drunk driving, spousal abuse, child neglect, first degree murder, etc.      I don't know what world you live in, but I don't even want to visit.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	One more way for men to exert power over women.    People don't really understand Roe v. Wade.  Yes, it legalized abortion, but at the core of this case was a question about privacy:  a person's right to privacy rather than his/her right to reproductive freedom.  If they overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court would, in effect, be saying that people do not have a right to privacy.  That's not going to happen.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	I completely agree with everything you said. It's a woman's body, it belongs only to her. She should be able to do as she pleases. A lot of people will say that she has no right to murder the baby. But some people don't see it as murder. As for me, i'm on the fence about whether it is murder or not. I am so for women being able to have this right, but then i wonder if the baby really is alive enough to feel it's death...or is just alive like a plant or something. I should research this more =)|`|EJVKqFiHaa	How can you say it will be "worse for the babies?"    How can it get WORSE than death?!    As for my opinion, people shouldn't be having sex in the first place till marriage. Really, if you go out and sleep with multiply people in the name of love, that makes you a you know what.     Its just irresponsible and then wanting to kill your own flesh and blood for your mistakes. Wow.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	I don't know of ANYONE connecting abortion laws and sexual activity.    We KNOW adults have sex . . . and women sometimes get pregnant.    We're just trying to keep the baby for "paying the price" for the mother's irresponsibility.       Dan in Miami|`|AGmZNf7zaa	I honestly think this is a stupid argument and everyone should just do what they want and not argue about it... this topic will never be agreed on and it should come down to the individuals values, I don't really agree with abortions , but in some cases I do,  I would have to get pregnant first at my age and see how I feel to have a side for this argument.|`|uKaj1kHfaa	People should keep their legs crossed IMO if they don't want kids, or can't afford them at the time. That's what I do. I have discipline.|`|13fDE4nGaa	Maybe people who don't have the resources to Properly raise & nourish a child should be made sterile at birth.    I really believe this will become a fact of life someday very soon|`|tvWm1e4naa	if abortion will be legalized, it will make abortion legally acceptable to all. The "legal" word  makes things look correct even if it's not. The next generations would really think it's not wrong since it is legal. Therefore they will do it uncautiously, openly and without fear. Whether they say it's still blood or whatever excuses they use to kill an unborn child (in an earlier/earliest stage), still there is LIFE in it. And for me, it is a blessing from heaven and no one has the right to take it's life away, not even his own mother.  If some people do it even if it's illegal, that is their choice but at least the law has kept its morality and sanity to keep it illegal to remind us not to do it. This is a democratic country and the right to live should be given even to the unborn. Let us all be responsible with our actions.|`|NjSWQFBYaa	It's not about forcing abstinence. It's about protecting the life of the unborn, so that they get their shot at life.|`|a3jmdJMMaa	Because if you don't have the option of just aborting your baby, you'd be more careful so you dont have to go through having a baby. Either way I think getting rid of abortion completely is retarded because doing it will upset a lot of people and there are most definately better ways to deal with it. Soemtimes people really really want them/need them and it is a freedom IMO.|`|24a0caf47c1c1686342d550d49ab66b6aa	Because people that are overly religious can't think clearly, they only blindly follow their leaders without question.  It doesn't make sense to those of us with rational minds.|`|apx4rrW3aa	What is "abstainent"?|`|kprKXEOSaa	Abortion will never be made completely illegal in this country.  I think most people understand that abortion is sometimes a medically necessary procedure.  But in comparison with how many abortions are performed, that number is very small.  Most people who object to abortions, object to using abortion as birth control, multiple abortions time after time, and late term abortion.  If there are no consequences for actions, people ARE less responsible about what they do.  If I could have an affair without my husband ever finding out, and if even God would never find out, well, I might consider having one.  That's human nature.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Presumably because prior to R Vs W, a woman who refused to marry the father of he child could be committed for life.

2ArMty0Uaa	This is an exact quote of what was said     "GIBSON: What insight into Russian actions, particularly in the last couple of weeks, does the proximity of the state give you?    PALIN: They're our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska.    GIBSON: What insight does that give you into what they're doing in Georgia?    PALIN: Well, I'm giving you that perspective of how small our world is and how important it is that we work with our allies to keep good relation with all of these countries, especially Russia. We will not repeat a Cold War. We must have good relationship with our allies, pressuring, also, helping us to remind Russia that it's in their benefit, also, a mutually beneficial relationship for us all to be getting along. "|`|zCjqOm11aa	Because Sarah Palin is an idiot.|`|DBIKou8faa	Because they watch SNL and take it as gospel.  Laughable,- them, not SNL, it hasn't been funny for years.|`|SaxjkMbSaa	Because it was actually  said by the comedian Tina Fey and it is obvious that Democrats make a big deal  clowns and comedians like Fey,  Frankin, Biden & Obama.|`|r6JskEtxaa	I know but it's funny and Tina Fey said it.    TINA FEY= GENIUS|`|AA10264185	Because it was a stupid thing to say. That statement was so silly she provided endless fodder for comedians across the country. She was trying to impress people with her abilty and experience handling world affairs. Would you vote for somebody just because you can see another coutry from the state they come from?|`|yS0hSFdOaa	Because it was funny.|`|HI0oQriqaa	the liberal media tried very hard to get things to fault Sarah and failing that they tried to make fun of her . the uneducated liberals ate it up . while ob's associatons with racists criminals and terrorists were not mentioned in most cases.|`|1b91ce32a95b13a1e9f83fdedfcea4f9aa	Palin did say this you uninformed puds.  Like Governor Granholm in Michigan stating they can see Canada or McCain in AZ stating he can see Mexico. Doesn't equate to foreign relations experience.  Equates to a fool.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	She didn't say that.  It was Tina Fay spoofing Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live.  The Liberal media reported is as the REAL Sarah Palin saying it.      Liberals don't know the difference between real and make believe.|`|V44ARW4maa	it fit into her general competency--or lack of same. Her claim to having foreign policy experience "because she could see russia from her house" just struck a head-scratching chord with the american voters as being rather goofy.|`|AA10565336	Because when you have a room temperature I.Q. it is difficult to distinguish between the real world and Saturday Night Live.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	Sarah Palin never seriously said that.     Tina Fey did when she played the part of Palin on SNL.    It's understandable that you might be confused about that, because people who hated Palin tried to get everyone to think she'd said it. The truth was secondary to their need to discredit Palin so that people wouldn't notice that she was better qualified to be President than Obama was.|`|mp6F8a6Oaa	I can see cars from my back window|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	Because the media kept on telling everyone that she was stupid and should not be VP or God forbid if McCain died in office the President...it seems to me that a lot of folks just swallowed most of what the media was saying....and it wasn't all the media but I would say 90% of them were saying it.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	Because people who live in the Continental United States do not know the difference between real news and Saturday Night Live.    Truly sad.  America has become a country of total morons and idiots.  No wonder all the other countries hate us.|`|1hHCRFBuaa	Because Tina Fey said it NOT Sarah Palin|`|M0ezqvrnaa	She didn't, it was a made up joke.|`|15oHAvflaa	The way she said it made it seem like that meant she knew everything there is to know about foreign policy.
AA11097492	There's no law against having a baby seat in the front seat of any vehicle. Except probably a motorbike. The only stipulation is that under a certain size of child, the seat must be rear facing.|`|0fFaXhIIaa	Put the baby in the back. Don't risk it.|`|AA11494150	That depends on your state law, age of the child, and if your car is equipped with airbags.    Car seat manufacturers recommend placing the child in the back because it is safer, but that is not make it legally binding.    Some states allow a car seat up front only if it is facing to the rear.    Statistics show the middle position in the rear seat is by far the safest place for a car seat. You should put your child there regardless of the law.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	no aslong as there are no air bags|`|pjJlPXWJaa	think so, but to make sure, email Ed Doulan of BBC, he knows bout all this legal stuff|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Only if air bags can't be deployed!|`|pYRpiSggaa	as long as ur van hasn't got passenger air bag of as long as its got a deactivation switch.
FCNAf6NTaa	It depends on the nature of your offense.  But admissions have gotten quite liberal since the war became so unpopular.  Education requirements have been loosened, and even people with minor felonies sometimes make it.  Unless you're guilty of a major felony it's likely they'll welcome you with open arms.  They don't really have a choice, do they?|`|1QLp7iC5aa	your probation isn't for a felony is it? Because the military wont take you at all, work with your recruiter, they can tell you everything you need to know, not to mention, since you already WANT to join your making their job easier, they will bend over backwards to make it happen for you. Good luck!|`|UoAZLRG8aa	The United States Military Services make every attempt to assess the moral quality of potential recruits, and several categories of moral offenses may preclude enlistment. This is primarily accomplished based on criminal record.     I should note here that there is no such thing as a "sealed record," or an "expunged record" as far as the military is concerned. The recruiting services have access to law enforcement and FBI investigative records, which -- quite often will list arrests in these categories.     Even if an offense is not found during the recruiter criminal background check, it is likely to come up during a possible (probable) security clearance criminal records check. If an applicant fails to disclose criminal history and it is later discovered, the individual may be charged under federal law, or the Uniform Code of Military Justice for False Statement, and/or Fraudulent Enlistment. (See the article, I Cannot Tell a Lie).     Military applicants are required by law, as part of the enlistment process to disclose any and all incidents that resulted in arrest or in charges being filed. When determining whether or not an offense "counts" for enlistment purposes, the services are primarily interested in whether or not the applicant actually committed the offense, not whether or not a "legal" conviction resulted.     Any offense that resulted in either conviction, or any kind of "adverse adjudication" counts.|`|flGXcxwGaa	I am not to sure. I know the best and fastest way to find out would be to google the closest recruiter to you and go in and ask them. They will also be able to answer anything else that may come up.

zDT4AgGcaa	I'm a cadet at west point, so i went through the same thing when I was applying.     Do four things: Run. Do situps. Do pushups. Do pullups.     go on a 3-4 mile run 2-3 times a week. After your run, get on the ground and rotate between 5 sets of 20-50 pushups, whatever your fitness level is. Do the same for situps. Do 5 sets of pullups, play with the number of reps untill you're challenging yourself but still have strength for the last set.    I would recommend weight training but you're so young haha! You'll put on weight in the army so don't worry about it man, if you can knock out 60 pushups, 70 situps and do a 14  2 mile run you'll be ahead of your peers at basic. The pullups will help you put some mass on your back and biceps. EAT A SHITLOAD OF FOOD! Sleep alot too!    Good luck brother. Haha who knows if you go field artillery maybe I'll see you out there and not even know it. I'll look for a skinny kid with lots of motivation. If you're thinking about it now you're going to do just fine.|`|AA11724847	hello    All you need to be is a good runner. The army don't want a load of musclebound freaks, they need endurance and hardiness. The test run they do is 1.5miles long, so make sure you can run this in between 8-10 minutes. Also, work on your press ups, as you'll be doing tons of these. One you can do around 50 in one go, you're doin alright!|`|AA10657435	it won't matter once you have all the 'inoculations'  and sucked in the depleted uranium...    PLEASE go to the links below!!!

You need ot work on your upper body strength particularly for doing push ups as this will  without doubt be called for many times over.   join a  gym and  ask for a training   guide I am sure most gym's have somebody available to give good advise.   won't  hurt to pop along to an army recruitment centre and have a chat  there too.|`|I1josn3saa	http://hooah4health.com/ will give you some information.

HIkXnqfzaa	You know what you need to google what happened in the Falkland islands wa and see how many British Royal Marines held off the entire argentine army.    see how the marines yomped over boggy wet ground in the freezing cold with 50kg packs on their backs and then fought the argies .    Our Royal Marines are the best Troops along with the SAS /Paras etc etc etc     so the usa marines by the time they had the map the right way up would be whooped.    i have worked with usa troops and they were really bad, lazy and unprofessional. No polish on boots, shirts not clean and ironed, woman's hair was in a scruffy pony tail not up above the collar, etc etc    I have also worked with the British Royal Marines, Paras etc  and they are the best by far there is no one else who can touch us as far as out Troops are concerned they are without a doubt the best in the world.    Gurkha's and Marines would never fight as they are allies|`|HOdisPCWaa	As a former section commander theres a lot of differance between the RM and the US marines anyone can join the US marines but the RM hyave to under go very stiff selection and a lot never make it. I have work side by side with 42 and with US mariens US marines are no better then our infantry soliers. Its a case of they have all the gear but no idea. When working with US troops you always make sure they are not behind you because as sure as god made little green apples you have a hell of a chance of being whacked by so called friendly fire, when it happens it does not seem friendly scared the whats sit out of me bad enough getting it from the bad guys, we can well do without our friends blasting us.  Heres an old one for you ' when the Germans bombed the British ducked, when the British bombed the Germans ducked when the yanks bombed everyone ducks' the US lads make good coffee. Next step for RM is not SAS they have the SBS, SAS selection is open to all soldiers in the British armed forces. US Seals are as close as they get to SAS and they are nowhere close, Seals are OK but they talk a better job then they actualy do. Do not get me wrong in the bar they are great set of lads on the battle field watch your ***?|`|KKH9y0ECaa	Grow Up - these our forces are better than your forces threads are getting tedious.|`|qSr6XKX0aa	umm... there's a few things with this, it's not a video game, they don't have HP or anything, it would depend on individuals and all sorts, all i do know is that our S.A.S destroy all. commandos, seals, spetznaz the lot.|`|zrbPNBXPaa	i would of thought royal marines. the us marines are a glorified unit if that makes sense.

Right  The U.S. Marines have a special force called The Seals. The Royal Marines have a special force called the S.B.S. Both are a powerful force and well trained. In a conflict of war you are glad of any force that is there to help.The Gurkha`s are the best fighting force in the world as they are Born into the service and take great pride and are feared by all. So in answer to your question, When in a war zone I would be glad of any help at all. But would make sure the U.S. Marines were told which way to shoot at the enemy and not at our Royal Marines.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	The Royal Marines....easy|`|HMgRFOhqaa	The U.S. marines would be true to form and take out some of their own men first and then surrender...|`|2a8f342e5a607281058fdd923f98379faa	It all depends all i know our jarheads are the best.

SEALs have the body of a linebacker and think like a brain surgeon. They would kill Royal Marines. As for US Marines vs Royal Marines I couldn't tell you|`|ndevqFtiaa	Royal Marines most likely, the Gurkhas are VERY tough race of people indeed. So tough they want them to join the UK police.    The Royal marines are trained in Skill    The reason the US is good because they train with technology.    If both sides had same technology the Brits would win because of better skill and much more diverse training programs.    E.g in Afghanistan the US had to call British Highlanders unit to fight the Taliban in the mountains and caves of Afghanistan. So their you go.|`|441GSyaMaa	Someone told me that a seargent in the para's that he knows is scared of royal marines... and considering paras are higher in brutality to the british army, that's quite worrying... next step to royal marine would be SAS.... so i'll say Royal Marines... even though they do look big (they normally wear tight shirts... lol)|`|DIEih5asaa	The Gurkhas would win because Marines are girly and wear frilly knickers.|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Im not sure but my God the Royal Marines are a bunch of hard B*stards!!!    xxx|`|Ioyt2RnYaa	No offense to you Brits, but if it were a firefight then the US would win. They have better weapons, technology, and integrity. Although the talent and skill levels are about the same, the US would win.  (Just like we did in the American Revolution and War of 1812).  Also, the US SEALs, Green Berets, Delta Force, etc. would kick the crap out of the SAS.  Also, US soldiers are really big because we play football and crap like that.  US marines would kick the crap out of any gurkha or terrorist.|`|TItRpckpaa	dont know much about the royal marines, they seem to have an equally good track record as our US. It depends are we talking marine force recon guys against royal marine equivalent. Just a regular private in the regular marines verse the same type of royal marine? Who knows it depends on the scenario, where it was faught, how much technology can be used etc.     Size of muscles isnt a good thing necessarily, core strength and agility benefit more since there really is no "fix bayonettes" style hand to hand combat anymore.|`|AA11097492	Give them the same equipment and let them loose.    Royal Marines are trained Commandos; Marine Corp are not.    With an element of luck the Marine Corp would take out a couple of the Green Death before they got finished off.    Gurkha's are renowned fighters and have been for well over a hundred years. Argentinian units in the Falklands War retreated when it was only rumoured that the Royal Gurkha Rifles were about to be deployed against them. I don't know how they'd do against Marine Corp on open ground; but put them all in a jungle. Dead Marines.
AA11494150	Yes, that is called a "process server". Check your yellow pages.     All states I'm familiar with require papers be served by law enforcement or a certified process server. Don't have a friend do it.|`|TtZhVhldaa	Yes. Or you can have a friend or relative do it for you. I've done it many times for people.|`|AA10425248	Actually, anyone over the age of 18 who is not a party to the action can do it.  However, it is better to have a process server do it, because they are familiar with the legal requirements.  Also, the local sheriff's department should do it for free, but it takes longer.|`|DFwvcUnhaa	Look up "Process Server" on any search engine.

The EU or Europe isn't a country, but as a powerblock of course it's the most powerful "superpower".     Its GDP & spending power is much higher than that of the US and still continues to grow, whilst the US economy is receeding.     The US spends more than the EU on military defence but the EU could undoubtably up its game should it ever need to. Plus the extensive experience of many European militaries gives it a huge advantage.     The US is the no.1 superpower as a single nation (at least for now) but as a powerblock the EU is far superior.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	EU GDP is catching up to the US but still has not overtaken the US. The US is the only single country superpower in all aspects at the moment. Russia is a military superpower and one of two renergy superpowers along with Saudi Arabia. The French and Germans are pushing for an EU military but I think this will prove difficult look at all the countries within the EU who have a grievance with another such as Poland with Germany. China and India are catching up but at the same rate it will take tens of years for them to enjoy the standard of living that most developed countries enjoy. For them to get there ironically it will take the purchasing power of the EU and US buying their goods to grow their economies. Again ironically this world economic downturn will slow this process of Chinese and Indian growth.

In Ireland, what of Michael Collins? Much depends upon which side one is on.    Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) - the military wing of the ANC (African National Congress) did attempt a few terrorist attacks against the white South African population, such as the bomb attack for which Mandela was convicted. What is more distressing is that when the SA whites responded with a robust counter-terrorist campaign that worked, the ANC and their satraps turned, in petty revenge, against 'uncle Toms' - black people who were suspected of assisting the South African Police in their counter-terrorist role, These victims were dealt withg in a horrific manner- often with the 'necklace' - a rubber car-tyre placed around trhe neck of the victim, filled with petrol, and then ignited. Mrs Mandela said "Together with our neclaces and our boxes of matches - we will liberate this country".    Nelson Mandela himself is the one unifying factor in South Africa. Like Collins, he was belatedly recognised as a freedom fighter by his opponents and has been a great catalyst in the reconstruction of South Africa on a basis that is free of colour advantage. When he dies, however, the rivalries between black tribes. many of which are as much 'immigrants' as the white population (look up mfecane if you do not believe me, and the incidence of rinderpest north of the Zambesi), will surface and South Africa will become Zimbabwe writ large.|`|AA11369432	A great wise man...who has seen and experienced a lot in his life.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	i think he's a great man for standing up to the devils who raped and tortured his mother land|`|kJM65nXJaa	One of the most admired and honorable men in the world today.

TOq7shCIaa	First I would compare the types of cars. Are they all the same make and model, or are they just all convertibles? All the same make and model might point towards a ring of people stealing the car and then reselling them with a 'new' vin number which is part of an insurance scam. Contact the insurance companies and banks of the vehicle owners and see if there were any problems with the policies and loans for the vehicle as far as payments not being made, or being late. That could show the car is not affordable and they might be scamming to get rid of the car and collect.    If they were all just convertibles it could just be that they are easier to gain entry because the roof can be cut easily. That is why they found the debris, because the tops were cut.    The best thing to do it put a few unmarked cars in the areas and observe. Stop any convertible cars that are seen and check the credentials of the driver and vehicle. Check for other cars driving slowly through neighborhoods and 'checking out' houses. During the daytime it is likely that these burglars are being dropped off by vehicle. This way they will not be seen walking along for any long distance and they can avoid witnesses. There is no dark of night to hide in for them    Ultimately, You might not catch any thieves but the pressure you are putting on the area might drive the thieves out.|`|BJERgbM5aa	My gut instinct tells me that these thefts are occurring with the cooperation of the vehicle owners for the purpose of collecting insurance monies.  I would focus on that.  Check out auto storage facilities, etc.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	I would break out my oversized magnifying glass and look for footprints...|`|AA12177973	My first move would be to attempt to curtail the thefts by getting the media to advise owners of these types of vehicles to garage them when they are at home, and to consider having a GPS tracking systems installed.  I would then start using a "bait car" in the theft areas.  I would also look at any car repair facilities or valet services that the victims might have in common, where the theives might have made copies of the vehicle's keys.  When expensive vehicles are taken and are not being recovered, it's often because they are being stolen to order, re-VINed, and then shipped out of the country.
V44ARW4maa	no homework help from me, sorry.... i think your teacher is interested in what YOU think, not what folks in here think.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	the most money and almost all of the bias main street media is a hard combo to beat|`|PHpKo5hZaa	I agree, but rather from the supply side. Certainly spending on engagements and advertising makes some difference, but...    The candidate raising the most money evidences with the money raised that he enjoys the most support.    Naturally, the money once raised will need to be spent within which missions it was raised.    Bias in the sample? Well, surely it was regionally biased, unless the radio station broadcasts nationwide and offers an 800 number. As regionally biased, then you would need to know whether it was a blue state or a red state. Also, you would have to consider what promotional value this particular station presents. If it plays rap music all day, or rather country music, or rather classical music - this would evidence racial bias as well as maybe bias on education levels. On the other hand, if the station broadcasts news all day long, this would tend to quell bias - unless of course the news is daily presented by partisan agencies (or includes commentary from partisan speakers like Limbaugh).|`|2UnjeOQUaa	Liberal or conservative I believe you will find this to be a truth. In part, it is not so much as to spending but supported. Back when a Bush could win he was well financed only because he was heavily supported. With the last 8 years of nothing but disaster Obama was heavily financed only because he was heavily supported. Obama winning by landslides represents the delegate, popular, financial and spending majorities.

ZvKw1XDmaa	Hey there sunshine!    Don't expect to hear from him all the time during rookies, or have regular contact with him either. Sometimes they just aren't allowed to use their phones, or they don't have time to write. My now hubby still has every letter I sent him when he was at rookies.     He should receive notification of what he can and can not take before he goes. If he can, get him to leave a copy for you. You can always ask him what he want's or needs when he gets there.     Mostly, just write to him as often as you can. Let him know that even though you aren't there with him, he is still the first thing you think of in the morning, the last thing you think about at night, and that he is still the guy you love and adore. Write to him about stupid things, like if you stubbed your toe. Talk about local news, life in general. It's fine to send pictures and stuff, but make sure that there are no pictures that you wouldn't mind everyone seeing.     If you are an Aussie, feel free to click on my name and I can give you the link to a great defence partners support site. It's full of handy info, and it's a great place to get used to the life!|`|w87icQkoaa	Make sure to give him a lot of "booty" before he leaves.  It may be a while before either of you get it again.|`|htaxf1jJaa	My 'boyfriend' is at basic for the Air Force right now too and you're only allowed to mail him letters and packages but the packages do get checked and opened just in case there's anything "inappropriate" so don't send him any cookies or sweets or candy or anything like that! And you can send pictures with your letter too, just make sure it's for all eyes cause he may wanna show them to his brothers in his barrack and if the TI sees it, the TI will definitely look at it.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Have him read the first link. The second link is what and how to send care packages.|`|flGXcxwGaa	well I would do these?  I would get him to go and get the list from his recruiter on what he can and cant bring. I would also start getting him use to not snacking durning the day and maybe even get the book surviving basic trianing which has lots of info on preparing yourself and tips like if you two live together one of you sleep in another room to get him slowly use to being away from you and so on.  And most deff let him know that you are not going to cheat on him and make sure he is prepared to not try to sneak around on you while there?|`|wo4xNVhRaa	I've been there so here's a few things to help him and you. Unless he's an athlete, he needs to work out. The better shape he's in, the easier it will be. He should focus on running long distance, sit ups, and push ups. If he doesn't completely suck at these three things, he'll be alright. Also he should ask his recruiter for some classes on military manners. That way he won't be the one making the silly mistakes. (Don't ever call a Drill Sgt Sir. EVER) Once he's there, make sure he sends his address and send him letters. And make sure you address them just as he tells you to. No fancy envelopes or perfume or silly cartoon stamps. All of those things can draw attention to him in a bad way. And if you send pictures, they can and will be inspected by the Drill Sgts. Keep them clean(not sexy) and be sure they don't embarrass him. These few things will help him alot.   -From a 10 year Army vet, SSG)|`|7Wdwo9W4aa	After about 5 weeks you will see that you dont have much in common anymore,He will have a weekend off,Go out with his new mates and play up bigtime,trust me been there done that!!! good luck|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I don't know the answers to your questions, as I met and married my husband after basic.  However, the two things I would suggest to help him out:    1.  Support him.  2.  Don't cheat on him.
df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	no you won't.  the cop has to pull you over the give you a speeding ticket.  right now the only tickets that come in the mail are for running red lights.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	You may or may not but keep in mind, it's perfectly legal for him to send it to you in the mail. But I'd guess he won't, but it happens.|`|XHmdPuLPaa	yep. radar. + cop +speeding = ticket. the only question is how much will it be.|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Smita has the only right answer here.  Speeding tickets are not issued through the mail in California (whatever may be permissible elsewhere), only red light camera tickets are mailed.|`|AA11494150	It is possible, but unlikely.    Most courts require proof of service, so the ticket would have to be mailed certified or delivered in person. This can be expensive and time consuming, especially if done on a regular basis.     In addition (with the exception of fixed speed cameras), the ticket goes to the driver, not the owner. He would have to do some additional investigation to see who was driving.     If he wanted to stop you, he would have done it at the time of the violation.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Yep
emNCaAq7aa	Trooper and Smita are right. There is probable cause for the case. If the prosecutor is trying to get someone to agree to something false they should not. During a plea the prosecutor and the defendant with counsel stands in front of the judge and the prosecutor relates the facts of the case. The Judge asks the defendant if the facts are correct. The judge warns the defendant a number of times about taking a plea. The judge invites the defendant to accept or reject the prosecutors information. No force is involved, despite what you see on TV. They don;t show this stuff because it takes time and is boring.  Going to trial especially a jury trial, takes up a lot of the prosecutors resources. It costs police departments lots of money, do you think I spent days a week in court consulting with prosecutors, baby sitting witnesses and testifying and not have gotten paid? If I was working days I wasn't working on a new case. if I was working nights I got OT and no sleep. The plea helps the defendant because he now knows how much time he will get, much less than if he would be found guilty at trail, usually.  One of the biggest reasons I would sign off on a plea (we were often consulted) was that it spared the victims or the family of the victims a lot of pain and it guaranteed that a bad guy would be off the streets for a while.   Pre trial worst case? The judge denies bond or sets a bond so high you can't get out until you are found not guilty at trail, months later.  Pre trail has little to do with pleas. You get your pre trail hearing first, if you are pleading that day it is really a separate thing from the pre trial hearing. Pre trail determines if there was enough probable cause for the arrest, enough to hold and the amount of bond, that is all. The same judge can take a plea. The type of case I brought to court the judge would not take a plea at pre trial because they tended to be very serious and defense attorneys needed time to get their case together|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	plea agreements are entered into because if every case was prosecuted at trial then it becomes draining on the resources it takes to prosecute those cases, i.e., tax payers paying more.  most prosecutors take cases to trial that are more heinous.  it's makes sense to prosecutors to plead out cases that clear cut and not worth the tax payers money.  it may not sound right or be a good choice for a victim but that's the way the system is.|`|AA11494150	There must be some evidence, or you would not be charged in the first place. If probable cause is not established at the pre trial, the case will be dismissed.     Plea bargains are common regardless of how much evidence there is. They often benefit both sides. The prosecution saves time and money, and the defendant often gets a better deal than he would at a jury trial.
uh2bkRrFaa	You sound like a real winner. You're going to jail for this and there is no question in anyone's mind reading your illiterate drivel, you've got a life of prisontime ahead of you.

That's truly where the credit is due.|`|6EB2JDFmaa	Its going to take much more than that to be called a success.  It sounds to me like your really saying, "drink some of this kool aid".
AA11827582	Because he is in dealings with their country's "president"  America is the  1 resource, consumer, and donator to most the other countries.. when our economy when in debt, their's did too because most of their consumers are American.     Its sad that we were in debt a year before Bush even noticed... almost all of the other countries are in debt also.. except for Iraq (because we give them billions a month)|`|2jNQhT7laa	Maybe it's because ... non-Americans like to be treated like human beings, as well? Because they actually are human beings?|`|EWIVAPx8aa	1.  Obama shows the rest of the world what a real Head of State looks like.    2.

mT6b7INZaa	http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/05/markets/...    Today was another HUUUUUUUUUUGE OBAMA VICTORY !!!!|`|AA11828439	You must not be paying attention. Look up the "Stimulus Package". It's in the news constantly!|`|VSmQWuhEaa	Exploiting it to pass pet projects without debate.|`|ZP0Ez7RWaa	By spending more expecting the return to be more than he spent. Let's see if it works.|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	There is a bill in the Senate right now that is being prepared to deal with the economy . . Obama has been in office for two weeks and has already accomplished more good than Bush did in eight years.  Obama is trying to work out a bi-partisan package plan to deal with the economy . . he wants to move quickly since the country is losing 500,000 jobs a month .. actually that figure just went up again . .     Actually, it isn't Obama holding up with helping the economy  . . he is trying to get Republican input into the bill . . but everyone has a different opinion and just want to play politics as usual at the publics expense. Obama will do the best he can . . but it is Republicans who do not care what happens to you.|`|6EB2JDFmaa	He's freeing his brethren in Gitmo and Guantanamo, he's getting bills approved for more spending, getting healthcare for illegal aliens and he supports this trillion dollar bill that is for Buy American so our exports will get taxed even higher by our foreign customers and that will kill jobs at home because our sales will go down as prices go up.

They don't believe Nancy Pelosi had anything to do with our economy, yet she said you could expect changes if we gave her control of the house. Since they don't like the changes it's best blame the Republicans. That's what they do best.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Yes, she said something foolish. Almost as foolish as: "Too many OBGYNs are unable to practice their love with women..."|`|q3i487UYaa	yes but what about the jobs for all the illegal aliens!|`|a954809e4f18646ae09e77b29aee6dbfaa	I hate hate hate Nazi Pelosi.

The primaries absolutely proved that a huge percentage of democrats don't like Obama, and did not want him to be president. Now, that doesn't mean they went so far as to prefer a Republican (which they obviously didn't). I do believe that there are many (especially the democratic politicians themselves!) who do not like him, but good luck getting any of them to admit it!  Those Dems stick together like glue when it suits their agenda, and right now their agenda requires that Obama be the knight in shining armor.|`|umrXBkeMaa	Of course not.  Every single person who voted for him still thinks he is the ultimate genius and savior, the "one" that "we" have been waiting for.    Instead, they think the problem is that everyone isn't just falling into lockstep submission to every word he says.  "He" has a "vision" and we are all supposed to "trust and obey".    If Obama fails, they will point to those who questioned his "wisdom" and "perfection" and say it is only because they did not submit.    There is no single Democrat who will admit that the man they thought was a genius actually DOES have a lower IQ than George Bush and actually has ZERO experience in running ANYTHING as an executive.    The story about him and Michelle FLEEING the White House this week because they "just had to get away from there" is proof enough that he is WAY over his head and didn't realize it actually IS the toughest job on earth, and you actually DO need even a LITTLE experience as an executive manager before you take on such a job.    He thought it was like a monarchy or dictatorship, where you declare the rules and the kingdom obeys.    And frankly, a lot of Democrats think that's how it works too.
s25Dh5RVaa	Can you give an example of when a stimulus bill HAS worked? I can't think of any, because they've NEVER worked. This one is no different.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	they don't.this has never worked before.so chances are it wont work now.i wish they would wait a year so we can have targeted financing where it is truly needed.but i don't think republicans will have the stones to hold out.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I have no doubt that it will.    We are screwed if this gets passed.|`|deb6cc217f6d8548e316ea609387df06aa	We do know this plan will do more harm than anything...|`|85kWzSzuaa	Because the Congressional Budget Office said that Obama's plan will do more harm to the economy than if we did nothing at all.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	we know it will do more harm,history tells us you can make permanent debt for temporary jobs and have a positive effect|`|44e4b7f98f10c547282e34b36740cb76aa	We know because of histroy. Does FDR ring a bell?|`|MEReSvZeaa	Well, you have to admit that if all the idiots are doing is spreading money around, they're actually doing nothing for the economy good or bad, and that's encouraging.    If democrats actually tried to meddle with the economy, they really could screw the pooch for all of us.
bmCInR5qaa	I expect, as with most things, they're calling it a liberal conspiracy.|`|X81oLqMtaa	Yes, they officially started calling it a recession on January 20, 2009, which coincidentally, corresponded with inauguration day.    Funny how that works.|`|1amF7oNwaa	A LONG TIME AGO|`|5ac2dCxJaa	I don't know but the Chief Economist at Merrill Lynch called it a Depression yesterday.|`|p9rbEdpdaa	You really don't have time to talk about things  like recessions when you are busy re-writing history to make the Bush debacle look like a stunning triumph!|`|BpcgaJd4aa	They've been calling it that for awhile now...|`|xkcLOfTKaa	It was only official on January 30th when the 2008 Q4 numbers came out and showed a second consecutive quarter of decline in the GDP... which is the technical definition of a recession.    So, yes... now everyone acknowledges that we have been a recession for appox. 6 months now... (2008 Q2 actually showed an increase of about 4% in GDP)|`|bYKVKmEKaa	Fox news is the only channel that tells the truth and you hate it.

A:~)|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Looks a lot of Fox zombies responded yet failed to acknowledge that the people who are officially responsible for a calling a Recession finally admitted that almost for the entire year of 2008 we were in an economic recession. They'll probably be the last ones to admit to the current Bush Depression.|`|WiCjhT95aa	I guess liberals would call this a pre-depression, then.
vCQeeR8Saa	I didn't care when Bush did it and I don't care that Obama continues.  As long as the groups are provided help to those who need it and are not discriminating against those who don't believe the same things as them, then I don't care if they get government funding.  But the money should be really going to the people who need the help, not the churches.|`|HTitV7Plaa	It doesn't sound like GW to me...    Obama said the new office, which he created by executive order, would reach out to organizations that provide help "no matter their religious or political beliefs."  "both secular and faith-based"  "We're also going to make sure we have a keener eye toward the separation of church and state."|`|xo4iux9gaa	we never had seperation of church and state in America and it doesn't ever appear on any National documents ...that term was invented by the liberal media to show everyone that they really didn't understand the 1st amendment.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	No.  This isn't a breach of the principle of separation of church and state.  Why can't folks on the Right understand this?    Under Bush, they were allowing these groups to discriminate against certain people.|`|zftm6qkKaa	As the worlds population continues to go unchecked, it will become predominately Muslim. Christianity and Judaism will someday be dwarfed. So tell us all, is the separation of church and state a good thing?    If the great experiment in Jeffersonian democracy is to survive, there must be a long standing history of zero tolerance for religion in our government.|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	Poor, poor ACLU....|`|8tf5rOXdaa	It won't even phase them to change their position.

Remember the Pentagon's $600 toilet seats?  The problem is that, in order to make the economy look artificially strong, the government includes these figures in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  This is false information, because the government doesn't work for its money; it gets it from us.    The government also claimed to have made a boatload of money off of those same securities.  That claim would have been true, if the securities were free to begin with.  If you look at it objectively, we've lost money on them.
AA12191521	payoff from Obama for buying an election.|`|p9rbEdpdaa	OK, Pied, pay attention. They aren't getting any. You have fallen for more right wing propaganda. You know, untrue statements that will prove to be untrue but will be embedded in to the public conscience to the point people will think they are true. Despite the Republicans' latest talking point, this is not true, so I guess your question is moot.|`|zfVrGTzxaa	Well they have to prepare for the next election cycle, votes cost money.    But that is just my opinion.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	They don't and they are not getting any.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	They don't.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	You're misrepresenting the facts.  ACORN isn't getting any bailout money.  The word ACORN appears nowhere in the bill.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	they don't    I can't help but notice thumb downs for "they don't" from people who are supportive of Obama, yet on this question they are against a bailout for ACORN.    Do you guys "thumb down" in lock-step too now?|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	Yes they are getting money.  It is hidden in the bill behind something else.  If it doesn't create jobs and stimulate the economy it should not be in the bill, period!|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Who said they were getting it?  If you can not prove something why insinuate it as a fact?|`|neuprBeGaa	At present, they don't.  If they come up with a workable plan to help stabilize neighborhoods hard-hit by foreclosures, then they may become eligible to compete for some.    ACORN does much more than merely registering impoverished citizens to vote, identifying and separating possible fraudulent registrations when they turn them in to simplify the job of the election officials, and testifying against their own employees when a few of those employees are found to be submitting those fakes.  They also do a lot of non-election-related community work.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	They don't but are slatted like other community organizing groups to get $600 Million ( you need to read the bill Texas A&M)! It'sayback time thats what this is!|`|AA11481615	Who is ACORN|`|r1fLDlhCaa	does anybody deserve bailout money? i think not....|`|AA12176505	Because they committed election fraud and succeeded in getting Obama elected.

And ACORN is a big supporter of Obama.     Bank of America is a recipient of bail out funds.     Here is a link to a document from Bank of America breaking it all down where OUR tax money is going.    http://www.bankofamerica.com/foundation/...|`|iuoB7pf0aa	They don't.

They deserve no sympathy for their actions.|`|LzPhdri5aa	My first response to this would violate community standards because it would insult you.

If these companies want to cry about how they need a bailout, they government specifies the terms and they can take it or leave it. Go take out a business loan from any bank and you'll find out just how closely they go over your business plan with a fine tooth comb.

CEO's aren't being forced to sign the agreement at gunpoint or anything.|`|pM81f5tnaa	In this case, yes.   The bailout money is justified only because it is in the public interest to rescue these companies.. It was never intended to pad the pockets of failed CEO's.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Bonuses are part of the pay structure for financial firms.  My sister is a secretary, and half of her salary is in a bonus.  So when Obama says bailout money is going to pay for (non ceo) bonuses, this is a good thing, because that industry is cutting jobs.|`|iqGY5jvfaa	does that include taxes...?|`|OFA2LAM5aa	If the government bails out your company, it should have the right to determine your salaries.    CEO's at taxpayer bailed out companies need to leave the BMW and Lexus at home and take the subway to work. Also taking a sack lunch everyday, instead of eating an expensive lunch, won't kill you. A little humility might be in order.|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	Employers can start paying a decent, livable wage, or eventually be thrown out the hard way by the hungry mob. It's their choice.|`|lAsbD5B7aa	Their work performance should decide how much they make.    But they set their own pay, they can give themselves more, but should we pay them for that?|`|GtO2FMnTaa	Since the government is bailing them out, they are government employees.    We do not need government employees pulling down 40 million a year, particularly since the reason the government is bailing them out in the first place is because they suck at their jobs.|`|3eGKlXVbaa	If the gov bails out the company then they are in all technicality share holders and have every right to voice an opinion.|`|U50orfPhaa	Hey the bill don't affect the bonus, just the income- they will most likely get the other Millions for their bonuses.   McCain said that the Share Holders should have voted and decided these things- not the gov't!   Share Holders - that is the law we should have that they have more control into the companies incomes for employees.|`|Na7NqZnMaa	We should decide how much Obama should make. Is $1 too much?|`|Jkjb0pBCaa	Absolutely not. Nicholas Sarkozy, the president of France, once said that he believed it was the goal of the socialist left for "everyone to make minimum wage." I think he's right.     You have to understand that as soon as you give someone the ability to attack the rich, it is only a matter of time before suddenly YOU are considered the rich. You can't let petty jealously to allow you to throw away your rights.     there is only one person who should decide how much you make--and that's the people who are paying you. Those corporations are private entities, with shareholders. If the shareholders had a real problem with those bonuses, they could swing votes by threatened to sell stock. Since they haven't done it, they obviously don't care, and who is the government to poke its face in and tell them that they should care? The state needs to mind it's own damn business, and that means Military, Currency, and fixing the roads. Period.|`|ZEOoMIXSaa	LISTEN IF MY TAX MONEY IS USED TO BAIL OUT A COMPANY,AND THAT EXECUTIVE WORKS FOR THAT COMPANY,YOU BET YOUR A*S HE HAS A RIGHT TO SAY HOW MUCH THAT PERSON MAKES.MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT BEFORE POSTING A QUESTION|`|p9rbEdpdaa	The share holder aren't paying them. The tax payers are! This limitation is only CEOs of companies that have gotten TARP money. There are also some provisions for delayed compensation in the form of stock options after their company has paid back the government, so I don't think this is at all unreasonable. Same thing happens with any other government employee, BTW, except they don't have the stock options provision.|`|qt9rrk6xaa	The socialism is in giving Wall Street taxpayer money.

I'd rather it be capped it at 20,000 dollars.  Again...you don't get rewarded for failure.      Many people think this is the foot-in-the-door...I beg to differ.  I think it's a protection offered to taxpayer to assure we get paid back first before the company exec's enjoy a life of luxury.    Just so there's no misunderstanding - I'm for the free-market...limited regulation coupled w/ maximum oversight.    We're long passed deciding whether or not we can get in or out.  The funds are out there -- we need to regulate these pigs b/c it's apparent they're ungrateful for the help as they go to LV, go to Dana Point for a 444,000 dollar junket, buy jets, etc. etc.  *******.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	He isn't, so you have nothing to fear.

AA11494150	If you plea not guilty, it will go to trial.     If you plea no contest, the judge will give you an opportunity to explain. This would be the time to show him the sticker is now current. There is a good chance he will take that into consideration.    However, he is under no legal obligation to do so. Traffic laws are "strict liability". This means knowledge of the offense does not need to be established, and you are responsible to make sure your vehicle is legal. Simply having an expired sticker is a violation, even if you did not know.    Most states include court costs in the price of the ticket, you can contact to court clerk to be sure. If that is the case,  it will not cost you more to appear. It is worth a shot.|`|J5KpCgeEaa	If you go get it inspected and are honest then you can show the judge that you took immediate steps to correct your laziness on getting your car inspected.

But your plan also won't work for the fact that you will be showing proof of an inspection that took place after the ticket so don't plea not guilty.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	In my State if you get your car inspected before going to court, and bring proof of the inspection with you to court, the judge will usually dismiss the ticket.  They want compliance.  Pennsylvania is probably the same way.    The judge does not have to dismiss the ticket.  But they usually do.

EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    Tradition is that the man buy the woman an engagement ring then wedding ring; sometimes they come as a set.    The purpose is that the man is proposing to the woman.  He offers her an engagement ring as a token of his commitment to her and her acceptance is that she accepts said commitment.   Rings do not have to necessarily be fancy.

AA11311741	Conservatives claim they give more to charities because a small number of them tithe to the church.|`|41557171b2bed12aaa3d03e792712ab6aa	Look up the stories that John Stossel has done recently.|`|AA11452268	I could see that conservatives do give somewhat more than liberals do if only because they tend to be regular churchgoers more so than liberals are, and that with the minister and all the other people standing right next to you, there's a bit of pressure to drop something in the collection plate, isn't there? The question is, how much of that money goes towards helping impoverished people, and how much of it goes towards building a new youth wing?    The problem with John Stossel's report is this: he chose a wealthy community and a poor community. The poor community just happened to be more conservative, and the wealthy community just happened to be more liberal. The truth is that political orientation makes no difference: poor people are more likely to contribute to charity than wealthy people are. You hear about stories like this all the time. I live in Texas, a red state, where almost everybody goes to church somewhere, and there was a story a few years back about how all the "Secret Santa" type trees where you select a child to sponsor for Christmas and purchase him/her gifts had been cleared out at the poor malls, but the richest mall in town (which was located in a very conservative and religious area of Dallas, mind you) still had tons of unsponsored children left just a couple of days before Christmas. Of course, once the story made the news, the rest of the cards were cleared out, but it took widespread humiliation before the rich guys decided to do their fair share.     This is not to say that all wealthy people are selfish, though. It's just that when you live in a wealthy area and you don't see poverty on a daily basis, you tend to forget it's real. You have to get out of your box a little to understand what it's like not to have all those advantages.    Incidentally, I'm a liberal, and although I earn only $15,000 a year teaching at a local university (I'm not tenure track because I only have a Master's), I contribute to the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders regularly. I never claim these as deductions, however, because I don't have enough other deductions for it to matter. I also give money to people on street corners, and I always tip 20% or more to waiters. Oh yeah, and I also drop off the clothes that my children grow out of at the local Mission from time to time, but that hardly seems worth claiming.    I have friends and acquaintances on both sides of the political spectrum, and to be fair, I think all of them contribute to charity. The only ones that don't tend to lead fairly closed-off existences and are the types who generally feel that anyone who is poor has no one but themselves to blame.|`|5fda23d70935370dfad685c3e9e6f49caa	http://www.realclearpolitics.com/article...    read the whole thing.|`|bf2a3ddd524c28f1d81e5ea4630a113eaa	The proof is in the pudding.|`|5283916bd97800fa4a5205bab505fdfeaa	It is extremely important to look at which charities the conservatives are giving to. This is also very true in general. This question is poorly worded and is way too broad to really answer in depth.     Shortly; the conservatives might possibly give more to charity, I really don't know the answer to that though, but you also have to look at so many other factors that it is impossible to determine a real concluding answer.     So I guess there is no proof....  For either side of that argument.

umrXBkeMaa	I don't think they knowingly voted that way.  Older Americans, who lived through (and many came from) Communist regimes knew exactly what Obama represented, and they overwhelmingly voted against him.    The people who voted for Obama were:    1. The well-off elite baby boomers, who have a good life and lots of money and a "hey, we got ours, that's all that matters" mentality, and they see this as a casual experiment that really won't really affect them much.  If the country gets ruined as a result, well, in about 20-30 years they'll be dead anyway, so what do they care?    and    2. Younger people in my generation.  Most of them have had coddled lives, with everything paid for and given to them by their baby boomer parents.  Most are woefully ignorant about Communism, unless you've heard lots of stories from grandparents who lived through it.  We weren't even born during the Carter era, so unless you read about it and heard stories about it, we don't even know what "inflation" means.  And we really don't know what hard work is.  Many of my peers would gladly surrender freedom if it meant they could just stay home and play video games and eat Raman noodles for the rest of their lives.    The sad thing is, by the time we realize what has happened, and just how bad socialism is (it's been tried and failed miserably time and time again, and the regular people always suffer the most while the government people get richer and richer), it will be too late.  And worse, our generation is completely unmotivated to do anything about it.  It's not like we'd rise up and risk death for a revolution or anything.  We'll just moan and complain and wait for "someone" (else) to do something about it.    The only hope we have is for those baby boomers who don't fit the mold, who WOULD take action, and who are probably just waiting for a sense that the rest of them are ready.  If they ever get together and realize how large their numbers are, I think we'll see a HUGE and sudden revolution take place.  For history, look at Hungary.  We're pretty much heading into a scenario similar to Hungary right before their revolution against the Communists, and that happened all of sudden one night when people stormed a major news media building (radio station).    When 1000's (or even just 100's) of motivated people storm CNN or NBC or the New York Times and take hostages, that will be the event that turns it all around.  Millions of Americans throughout the country will support them and begin fighting back.    We haven't reached that point yet, but after this stimulus thing passes and the economy gets significantly worse, we'll be a whole lot closer.|`|Souvww0maa	A lot of people voted for Obama without questioning what it is he stood for.  The Media buried his past or said it was just the republican hate machine in action.  A good number of Obama's voters voted for change, and they are going to get it.  I just don't think this is the change they had in mind.  They got bamboozled.|`|IUw5Z395aa	No, you voted for Bush under the pretense of unbridled capitalism, and that is exactly what you got, and now the BHO is trying to correct that error|`|0kjWE73qaa	Probably...though not all Americans voted for socialism...coughcough|`|pVdV4gwgaa	I didn't vote for Socialims I voted for Obama so where is this going?|`|ohgrMZDkaa	Woah there, that is the Democrats with all the conspiracies...The Moon Landing, 9/11, Bush caused Hurricane Katrina, name one Republican conspiracy theory?

The more  intelligent voted that way because they hate others having liberty and freedom and have enough power to protect themselves from the ravages of socialism. And then the last of the purveyors of serfdom at best, slavery for most, voted for it because they will be the rulers.  Those that did not vote are the real losers, for through their ignorance and indifference have chosen the head stone for freedom's grave. The patriot will die a hard death for they will continue to fight even after the reality has been set in stone.  The idea of a free election every four years will soon be a thing of the past, if it isn't already, because with a two party system we can not necessarily chose the leader of our choice. And the last item on the agenda is the illegal Federal Reserve system which controls the government and the media and basically tells the public who to vote for.|`|4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	Look on the bright side, every four years we have a chance to correct mistakes by voting again.|`|GkShK7JZaa	People who didn't vote + People who voted for McCain = most people did not want socialism.|`|sf7lOcIiaa	Pyeblow, the European Union passive-aggressively forced those countries into accepting socialist economic plans.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	The Republican party is the only political party in the world who's main agenda is based on a "conspiracy theory".

It would hurt a lot more if America did not help, but Russia still has crap for logistics and their navy is a bunch of rust buckets.|`|MbssN5dcaa	Yes, and we would not be able to come to Europe's aid either.  Russia knows it too.  I'm somewhat amazed they haven't done more considering their financial problems.  Georgia may just be the beginning.|`|ndevqFtiaa	No way. What would Russia use, its technology is ancient, Russia has the same technology Saddam had just more of it. They allegedly have old 1970's tanks, old Mig planes, a small unmotivated army.    The NATO airforce with its latest Euro-fighter will just pulverise the advancing Russians, and on the ground NATO technology will easily overcome whatever the Russians have.    Also have you ever heard of a European mail escort? no its always a Russian mail escort? So that should tell you how dire their economy is that Russian men and women are selling themselves.|`|3woyz5ucaa	Yes Russia would succeed. Russia has new T-90 tanks with new reactive armor, and by 2009 the army is planning to use a new MBT known as the T-95 (little is known about it) and possibly the Black Eagle Tank. The Russians by 2009 will also test flight a stealth plane known as the Sukhoi T-50 PAK FA project, made especially to compete with the X-35 JSF and F-22 Raptor. Russia has the most nuclear and chemical stockpiles and their SS-27 Topol-M systems can penetrate any shield, including the new one that America wants to build in Poland.    Russia has also made what some people call Warsaw Pact II. This is known as the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization) which includes Russia as leader, China as secondary leader, some previous soviet states, and Iran as an observer. Russia is also allies with India which will also receive the stealth plane technology but will have a variant known as FGFA. Russia is also producing new BTR-90's with better armor.    On top of all, I highly prefer the MI-24, MI-28, KA-50 over the AH-64 Apache. Though European troops are trained better for combat and have more expensive gear such as body armor while Russian soldiers just have a standard AK-74 and a bandana instead of helmet though after WWII, they have not lost a war in statistics (Soviet Afghan war: 15,000 soviet KIA and 1.1 million Afghanis dead including civilians). Russia is also producing new SAM to replace the S-300. The new S-400 is more then 2.5x better then the American Patriot.    If there is a war between the 2, and if nuclear weapons aren't used, Conventional bombs will be used and the Russian FOAB is the largest non nuclear bomb ever exploded (more then twice the explosion of the American MOAB). The Russian Federations army is going though modernization now, which recently changed to a contract army and currently the army is full of drafted criminals where people literally get their balls cut off (I'm serious, there have been these situations), in about 2 years the military will be a lot stronger and more organized then it is now.|`|LEBV1FPuaa	Yes and here is why!    I will not bother you with the technical details but only hit on reality.    Name a EU country with over 75,000 troops other then France and the UK? Which still only have 15000 stationed in Europe due to obligations. The fact is there are only about 65,000 troops in Europe now that the Balkans have been stripped. Russia has 2.5 million active duty troops and 3 million reserves thanks to Putin.    The missile sheild will make the air war or ICBM attack only 40% successful. The real issue about Europe is that in 2 weeks 30,000 Russian tanks and 15,000 helicopter gunships will have run over the European armies like road kill. The Europeans are unarmed and once they enter a city there is no stopping them!|`|89YkHxMUaa	To some degree yes. They supply some main resources to Europe and could cut them off.|`|nPCvqXv7aa	I think Russia would succeed if America helped, but not without their help.  Sorry to let you know this, we can actually cope with out help from America, thank you. In fact we would do better without America, less friendly fire and all that.    toodle pip

By the accurate definition, most people in this country, including dems, are not liberals.|`|52efeea3c9eae1de26f16355e12a7d09aa	In the USA it is often used as a derogitory term, but not in Europe.

Liberals may respond by arguing that any value that must be state supported us baseless, and that true values are the property of humanity as a whole and not just conservatives.|`|QoGVbSZ4aa	You could do a thesis on that but essentially they are perceived by conservatives as everything that is wrong with America today.

Which ironically they also use, with much less malice in their voice.      IMPEACH - Look at how Ann Coulter treats kids on college campuses!  She has no respect for anyone, she just acts obnoxious to get attention (same as Rush).      I'm on a computer that has youtube blocked out.  Otherwise I would post the video of Ann giving a speech on a college campus (can't remember where).  She dropped multiple ethnic slurs, and finally went off on a rant about "towelheads."  A young man stood up in the audience during Q&A time, and said VERY POLITELY that everyone there was a fan of hers, and had come to listen to what she had to say, but could she please refrain from the slurs that he felt were detracting from her message.  She berated the young man and continued her rant about "towelheads" (I think she said something about "towelhead go home.")      So your point is moot.  That man was very polite, and she was a brash, unsophisticated bigot.  As usual.      IMPEACH:  Being open-minded doesn't mean we have to embrace hate.  You regularly bash liberals for being too soft, for rolling over and not standing up for things.  Bigotry is something most Liberals feel very strongly about, so why shouldn't we stand up for ourselves?    Bigotry may not be illegal, but when you have a platform at an academic institution, dropping slurs and swears does nothing but make you sound ignorant.  The young man confronting her wasn't even Liberal, he was conservative and he was nicely trying to point out to her that the slurs were detracting from her point.  My father (who happens to be very conservative) taught me growing up that if you have something intelligent to say, you can say it without slurs or swears.      If it had been Keith Olbermann up there dropping the N-bomb, you would be all over it.  The double-standard in politics just points out how utterly pointless and hilarious it all is.|`|axHyoVqGaa	The reason liberal is used as a derogatory term in America, is because the majority of liberals are not really liberals, they are socialists who support the Democratic Party.  If you want to find true liberals, you have to look to those who support the Libertarian Party.  They are more closely aligned with what is known as classic liberalism.  If the people supporting the Democratic party are true liberals who support individual rights and freedoms, why is it always the liberal Democrats who are trying to ban firearms and smoking?  Why do they favor socialized health care, when it limits our individual right to choose?  If the people that support the Democratic party are true liberals who support moderate reform, why has the man elected by them to be president just tried to put three tax evading crooks in office?  If the people supporting the Democratic party are true liberals who respect and accept behavior or opinions different from ones own, why is it that they are the first ones to shout down anyone that has a different opinion on Global Warming?  Make no mistake, the word liberal has become synonymous with the word socialist, in America anyway.
ac875abbab7bca937765f6f464cd0482aa	Of course you would three things have to happen...Amnesty, Immigration Reform and Border Control...All three will have to be implemented simultaneously or we will be back in the same situation..... in 20 years or even less|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Of course enforcing the border is possible - at least to an extent far, far better than we enforce it now.   This first step is absolutely necessary before any decisions about our current problems can be addressed properly.    My opinion is that amnesty would be a can of worms - infinitely more complicated than anything our homeland security and immigration departments could handle - and, further, I believe amnesty is pretty much just another word for open borders.    A few examples of the complications:   How can we possibly know how long an illegal immigrant has been in this country when they leave no paper trial - or have used several different names or identities - and, even if this were possible, how long would it take to investigate each individual - times approx. 10 million?  When amnesty is announced, I suspect there would be a literal flood of immigrants crossing the borders in numbers like we've never before experienced. The encentive would be instant and legal US Citizenship.  Do we give amnesty to those with stolen or false identities or SS numbers?  Do we then prosecute those (like we do our own citizens) who have falsely collected social services?  Do we attempt to collect back taxes owed (like we do to our own citizens)?     Amnesty is not the easy answer it seems when closely examined. Illegal immigrants have created a very difficult concern for this country.     And, as you ask in your question, what do we do in another 20 years? Unless we adequately secure our borders, amnesty certainly wouldn't stop the future influx of illegals.    As a foot note, and in all fairness to the immigrants who see illegally entering this country as an opportunity to provide a better life for their families - I believe the United States has helped create this problem with its passive enforcement and blind eye policies in the past - as well as the employers who continue to hire these people without any real consequences.    Yep, it's a can of worms, all right.|`|AA10349376	I agree on an amnesty on A LOT of conditions. They have to be here long enough, like 10 years minimum. They gotta have a job. They can't be criminals of any kind. (THAT VERY MUCH NARROWS IT DOWN)|`|90a8774ea08ea42c254b9e204658b644aa	Well theoretically, yes on both questions.

Unless they enforce concrete laws then of course you'll be at it again in another 20 years.  It is enforceable if they would just do it and hire enough people to do the job.
OAEuYZkZaa	I'm 52 years old for the record.      In my not at all humble opinion, if a young man is old enough to risk his life for his country, he ought to be able to buy a drink or buy a gun, legally~    Doc|`|082vOBNKaa	While I am now well above age, I entered the military at 17 and lived in the barracks at my 1st duty station. There were plenty of out of control barracks parties that went on and anybody who wanted to drink would. On the flip side when I was on the way back from my 1st deployment I was only 18 and we stopped in Ireland. Our BDE CDR bought everyone who was of legal age a beer, that smarted a bit. I was 20 when I got to my 2nd duty station, which was overseas, so I could drink anyways.    I can see an argument both ways but for me it comes down to two of the most serious issues in the military: sexual assault and suicide.    Fact is the majority of sexual assault cases in the military occur between the ages of 17-21 (barracks age), and alcohol is involved in 2/3 of every sexual assault case.    Suicide rates are climbing in the service. Yeah, deployments and stress contribute to these incidents but no need to involve alcohol A DEPRESSANT legally to these Service Members who are feeling suicidal.

Some leaders feel differently, but to be honest, I couldn't care less if one of my underage Soldiers tips back a beer, so long as he is responsible about it and keeps him/herself under control.  IF that control waivers, then we have a problem, and I will deal with it personally.    EDIT:  I disagree with lavadog.  While the Army does suffer from such crimes, I think it's unreasonable to claim that underage Soldiers who also drink alcohol are the sole cause of them.  Most of the 19 year old Soldiers I know are  no less reasonable, competent, and confident than the 21 and 22 year old ones.|`|C7wjR42Daa	No need to lower the drinking age.    If you knew how much trouble 1 underage drinker causes daily in the military you would not be asking this question.    Underage drinkers get busted everyday in the military. From UA/AWOL,  to rape, to theft, to assault, to drunk and disorderly, to disrespect, the crimes committed by underage drinkers is through the roof.     This creates a backlog of paperwork, lowers the unit morale, and is just one huge headache. To many resources being wasted on underage drinkers. A 17,18,19, and 20 year old tends to be less responsible then some who is of age.    And what does drinking alcohol have to do with the military?|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Don't see why not...

When I entered the service in 1980 the age was 18 or 17 with a military ID in Florida. Our barracks had beer for sale in the soda machines.  The problems could be broken down by age.  We had more car accidents, AWOLs, assaults and vandalism attributed to the 18-20 groups than any others.  The Marine Corp had more control with their personnel limiting hard alcohol to 21+ Marines.

Es una gran resposabilidad no solo para USA, sino para todo el mundo ser presidente de USA. En mi opinion la administracion de Bush no ha sido la mejor tanto en politica exterior como domestica. La economia norteamericana ahora mismo esta en rececion y la Guerra de Irak ha sido, a mi juicio, tan innecesaria como cruenta. La politica inmigrante de USA bajo su administracion, a mi juicio tambien no ha sido la correcta ni ha hecho cambios sustanciales. No creo, tambien a mi juicio, que Bush se merezca mucho de los improperios que aqui le han dicho, las decissiones aprobadas por USA no son desiciones autoritarias de Bush, como muchos quieren dar a entender, aqui las decisiones de esta nacion las tiene que aprobar un congreso, en los errores de la politica de USA el congreso tambien tiene la culpa y no solo la personalidad de Bush.

La palabra proviene del latn vlere y significa apoyatura, valimiento, lo que ayuda. De all la expresin valido, ministro.                 El valor sera una entidad considerada por algunos pensadores como substante, una entidad con vida propia.                 Para la mayora de los socilogos, los valores son cualidades de las acciones de los hombres o que emanan de los objetos que los complementan transfirindoles algo que les falte a ellos y que, de hecho, su naturaleza humana apetece, estima o busca afanosamente. Vale decir, tanto la libertad como la educacin, no son substancias en s mismas pero de ambas emanan posibilidades de alcanzar ciertas cualidades valiosas.                 Hay valores que estn muy ce?idos a la realidad cotidiana de lo fisiolgico o somtico, como podran ser los valores econmicos en tanto satisfagan las necesidades de comer, vestir o procurar techo.                 Pero hay otros valores que emanan de nuestra naturaleza psico-biolgica y espiritual en tanto somos criaturas humanas. Estos son los valores a los que prioritariamente hoy nos referimos.                 Conviene recordar que el valor es siempre un fenmeno cultural, de modo que hay sociedades que consideran valiosas ciertas cosas que en otras comunidades no son estimadas. Cuando llega Espa?a a estas tierras, se encuentra por ejemplo que el oro de Anahuac no tena valor mercantil sino significado ritual-religioso.                 Este fenmeno merece ser tenido en cuenta en nuestros tiempos por cuanto en la aldea global todo se convierte en dependiente de todo gracias al progreso de las comunicaciones fsicas, tecnolgicas, cientficas y artsticas. Vale decir, la humanidad est expuesta a un complejo y recproco proceso de trasculturizacin, con inusitado impacto sobre las entidades que hoy nos congregan.                 El problema de los valores logra su mximo desarrollo en la llamada Escuela de Viena, el crear la filosofa de los valores sistemticamente expuestos, luego de la influencia del positivismo cientfico del siglo XIX, fundado en la creencia de que un mejoramiento permanente en materia cientfica y cultural nos llevara inexorablemente al cumplimiento de la ley del progreso indefinido.                 La guerra de 1914 a 1918 gener una gran frustracin en todo el occidente europeo, en EE.UU. y en Hispanoamrica. Los protagonistas de aquellas guerra, producto de la generacin positivista, quedaron muy da?ados, ms que por los bombardeos por el horror causado por el empleo de gases y las horribles muertes de los gaseados.  El hombre qued desmoralizado.                 Decamos que Viena registr aquello que se llam la vuelta a Kant. En esa bsqueda de nuevas formas de espiritualismo crtico apareci el tema de los valores.                 En consecuencia, tiene valor todo lo que es til, deseable o admirable para la persona y el grupo por el hecho de ser motivadores de nuestras conductas y en consecuencia observan una jerarqua u orden.  Los valores admiten grados, ms-menos y clasificaciones.                 Este es el origen del concepto tablas de valores o tablas axiolgicas, las que definen un orden de jerarquizacin de las conductas.                 Asimismo conviene recordar que el concepto de polaridad rige tambin en el campo axiolgico. Siempre a un valor se opone un disvalor o antivalor. A la justicia, la injusticia; a la libertad, la opresin; a la accin segn derecho, la accin delictiva.                 Por ltimo, incursionamos sobre la metodologa de investigacin usualmente empleada por cualquier instituto de sociologa experimental.  El interrogante es cmo comprobar los valores vigentes en una sociedad y en una determinada etapa de su existencia.  Una de las fuentes de informacin ms profusas son los medios de comunicacin y los de publicidad, o sea, los massmedias. El anlisis de los contenidos que se difunden a travs de los medios grficos, radiales y/o televisivos, permiten al analista aproximarse no slo a muchos de los valores vigentes, sino ubicarlos dentro de una tabla axiolgica en observancia con la moda.                 Mac Luhan hace ya treinta a?os afirm: Somos el hombre de la civilizacin de la imagen, en la que estamos inmersos. Esos instrumentos nos transmiten contenidos que podemos medir, mensurar extensivamente y detectar a su vez los intereses comerciales, crematsticos, polticos, ideolgicos, corporativos, etc., a los que responden.                 Reinterpretando a Mac Luhan y a Fromm, hoy podramos afirmar que esta es la civilizacin del haber, del tener y del provecho econmico.                 Esta visin fue utilizada recientemente por el Santo Padre al hablar de las formas violentas totalmente entronizadas, aceptadas y fomentadas por los fundamentalismos, citando entre ellos al econmico, tema ste que ya est en la literatura pastoral y sociopoltica, denuncindolo como uno de los ms da?osos disvalores de nuestro tiempo.                 La sociologa tambin se sirve de las encuestas de opinin y de tablas que auxilian en la mensura de sus resultados.                 La encuesta tambin permite descubrir algo muy curioso. Lo que la gente responde sobre cuales son sus valores proclamados o enunciados en una sociedad y los valores realmente vigentes en ella.  En el Prembulo de la Constitucin Argentina se habla de con el objeto de constituir la unin nacional, afianzar la justicia, consolidar la paz interior....

ac875abbab7bca937765f6f464cd0482aa	I am in agreement with many that we must control our borders. It is a national security issue and the drug lords freely pass drugs into the United States. Okay but we have problems on both sides of the "f". The "fence" will not stop the corruption of US Officials who allow these drugs to be passed. These same officials will have a key to open that "border fence" to admit the drug lords but will not permit the passage of the poor illegal immigrant that came to clean up your buildings instead of blowing them up. Why do so many drugs come into the United States? The answer supply and demand. We need these illegal immigrants to work the jobs that our so drug addicted nation will not fill. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. We do not need to repair the damaged levy by placing our finger in the hole. We need to repair the entire levy. DON'T let these politicians keep you ignorant....This whole smoke screen/border fence is just a ploy to get them reelected. These same politicians know that we need this "illegal" work force just as much as they need us.....Think.....if it were not true would it have taken them so long to do something about it. NO it wouldn't have. The 911 incident caused us all to think....but did the illegal alien mastermind that event. No, he didn't so why treat him or her as if they did do it. STOP RACISM. HUG AN ILLEGAL ALIEN TODAY   Who cares build the fence. The American public has clamored that they wish for this atrocity to be built. Then once all those billions of dollars are sunk into the building of this shameful wall......there will be no money for mass deportations...You see this is why the government is building this wall... We all know that it will not serve the purpose for which it is built....They didn't even build a levy that could protect New Orleans..... the illegals crossing are just as unpredictable.....Build the fence so they will be able to say later well we don't have the money now for deportations.......Also you will see discounts on ladders on the other side of the border. You just need a ladder to safely scale the wall without a scratch.|`|66624aec23031a8e5bf8ef4715ef5861aa	There are several problems, but I want to address the one that literally scares the fire out of me- lack of immunizations.  I am not going to sit here and point the finger at one race, but most all of the aliens that are entering our country today have never had any type of immunization for tuberculosis, mumps, measles, chicken pox, small pox, polio, etc.  For example:  I worked as an occupational health nurse for over 15 years, and in the past 3 or 4 years, give or take, there has been an alarming increase in active tb cases.  My fear is that due to the lack of preventative inocculations the illegals have had, there is a strong possibility to start epidemics again after the U.S. has spent God knows how much money to provide this medication to us free of charge.|`|AA10191605	My solution is that the government needs to allow more visas and citizenship. but stop the illegals.|`|AA10349376	It's not really a problem.

I don't get what's the big deal.|`|488823611b3dd130eb3a102a9da58b4caa	why do people keep calling it illegal when the government and large corporations obviously welcome it.|`|a75958322f60936f4095f65f5eda687baa	There are people who are trying to legally get through the immigration process, and millions of those spots are filled by immigrants here unlawfully.   Immigration laws are there for a reason.  For one, people who bypass the laws avoid medical exams and the need for a basic understanding of the culture and laws.  Illegal immigration is a burden on American taxpayers. The U.S. government depends on the taxpayers money to finance its programs like welfare, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps as well as law enforcement. An estimated 13% of this funding is used to support illegal immigrants. Dozens of hospitals along the border went bankrupt because of free emergency room for illegal aliens. They cost the United States over $24 billion year in taxpayers money. Alone half a billion dollars per year are required to incarcerate illegal immigrants and the Center of Immigration Studies in Washington says, that immigrants are 75 percent more likely to use food stamps, medical benefits and housing assistance than natives, producing at a cost of $68 billion per year. According to a report of the National Academy of Sciences, the net fiscal drain on American taxpayers is between $166 and $226 a year per native household.  The typical Mexican worker earns one-tenth his American counterpart. As it is the case in all Western countries, each individual must be able to pay a certain amount of taxes to cover his use of public services. Families with income below the poverty line pay very little taxes. In addition to these very low tax contributions, the poor are the main beneficiaries of welfare programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income, Food Stamps and subsidized housing. So if immigration further increases the size of the poor population, it is likely that there will be a negative effects on the public system.|`|822ebbeb5cb1905bb6be11f661b9184baa	EVERYTHING they come here and have 10 babys all living off welfare filling up our schools hospitals and jails refusing to speak english waving mexicans flags!!!|`|cbc084caf93242423ee35e6b5aaca4eeaa	Although not all residents of the USA feel the same way, there is a very vocal opposition to undocumented immigrants (that extends to even legal immigrants) that are working in the United States.    Many people are under the mistaken impression that these undocumented immigrants are taking jobs away from working class American citizens and taking advantage of the US Government by supposedly not "paying taxes". The focal point is usually placed on "Mexican immigrants", although that is another misconception.    My opinion is that the majority of these workers are ultimately doing jobs that many Americans are simply not willing to do (at least not without an extravagant pay). If these illegal immigrants actually charged the minimum wage, you would likely end up paying 3 times what you already pay for all produce available at your local supermarket.    It's not a clear-cut black/white issue. There are many things to consider, and its never as easy as "kick them out". These are human beings that have families and are essential components of the US economy.|`|84d39da73a493e6a03f9a47999bacf23aa	They don't have health insurance, consequently our emergency rooms, especially in California, are overflowing with illegals that don't pay.  There have been many ER's that have had to close.  They also drive without licenses and car insurance.  Our social services are required to give them welfare, food stamps, rent subsidies, free schooling and so on.  That is our citizens tax money, yours and mine.  The second largest income of Mexico, after oil, is money sent to their relatives in Mexico.  That may not sound so bad until you multiply it by the 10 or 20 million that are here and doing it.  My wife got rear ended by one and guess who paid the $500 deductible?  Basically, the wage they earn is so low that the rest of us have to take up the slack for them.  I think they should go back and fix their own country instead of invading ours!
AA11452268	I would write about recent rulings on "hostile environment" sexual harassment rulings and how they have led to an ambiguous, overly broad definition of sexual harassment that borders on endangering freedom of speech rights.     For example, there have been a number of "hostile environment" cases lately in which professors were removed from their positions because they used some sort of sexual language as a metaphor or as part of a lesson and some of their students took offense to it and filed a complaint. In a few of these case, the rulings were overturned upon appeal.    Although I agree with rulings that concern "quid pro quo" sexual harassment, I find the definition of "hostile environment" sexual harassment way too vague. I think the constitutionality of some of these rulings should be seriously questioned.|`|2fb36947afabe595b738859578b515f6aa	I'm trying to find out if my mothers husband (who is a felon) has a life insurance policy out on me and my daughter.

It is because of the cost of living in some of these locations.  Hawaii might not be a problem but still would require an overseas screening (medical/dental) to go.  Japan is not an option as accompanied orders for those below E4 because of finances, they cannot survive there with the high cost.  So he would get unaccompanied orders for up to 2 years in length.

But she's really splitting words because she thinks the American people are DUMB.    The outrageous pork barrel provisions in the huge spending bill that the Democrats are trying to pass off as a "stimulus" package aren't really "earmarks" in the strict sense of the word the way that "earmarks" are put into legislation in Congress.  She's counting on people not knowing that.    Earmarks are put in AFTER a bill is passed by both houses of Congress and been through the conference committee of members of both houses who reconcile the House and Senate versions of the bill.  When the reconciliation package comes to a final vote in each house, the members sneak in their individual "earmarks" without debate.    THESE current juicy fat pieces of pork are in the "stimulus" bill from the START - so they aren't earmarks.  The Democrats knew they could do this because they wrote the bills WITHOUT any consultation with the GOP and did NOT allow any discussion or debate.  They are trying to ram this bill down the throats of the American people.    The definition of "bi-partisan" in the Obama Administration is that Obama and the Democrats do everything THEIR way and if they can talk at least ONE republican into voting for something that the Democrats did, they it is "bi-partisan."   This is BULLSH^T.    The latest Gallup poll shows that 54% of Americans want either MAJOR changes in this so-called "stimulus" package or they want it REJECTED outright.  Isn't that MORE than the number that voted FOR Obama?????    Obama better start listening.|`|EOPD0ftfaa	no why would she say a proxy server address? Damn her!|`|2LrQHVb3aa	Yep, I can believe it.

4uike3ARaa	Guantanamo Bay is the body of water between the Caribbean and the small city of Guantanamo, Cuba.   It is also what we call our naval base located in that bay, but most sailors simply call it Gitmo.  Lately, it has taken on another meaning, as the location of one of the illegal detention centers that the Bush Administration felt it was necessary to have.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	Its a U.S. naval base located on the Cuba.

2jMFurDoaa	if its a very thorough background check they will see you were rejected from the military but if its shows why or not, i dont know. but thats bad enough, if they see the military wont accept you then the likelihood of them accepting you is significantly lowered. but you might get lucky, if they ask, tell them the truth and im sure they will give you a drug test and they'll see your clean! i mean everyone makes mistakes when they are young its how we learn.    good luck!!|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Yes it will...|`|92jr44kFaa	Good.

It is not as if you were arrested or cited for it.  All it was used for was to reject you from military service.  Maybe you have learned a lesson now I hope?|`|TItRpckpaa	No I can absolutely guarantee you it will not.  It is info not obtainable by any civilian employer. And you can still get a federal government job because you didn't fail it while in service and get discharged.   It is not illegal to fail a drug test in any state in america, your employment can just be denied/ terminated because of it.        Edit: Dude dont sweat it I know a few people this happened to. Its not even a crime or traceable.  It will never be brought up again unless you try to re-enlist.  Seriousely man dont sweat it.

BImIMnbzaa	Dude, you are at an age when friends all go separate ways.  These youthful friendships don't hang around at this time in life.  Each one needs to go his own way to accomplish what he has set out to do.  Later, when the dust clears, you will all reacquaint, but not now.    You said that education is important, hell that's the biggest motivator of all to complete your under graduate studies.  It makes no difference to anybody except you where you are in the pecking order of graduates.    When and if you do go into the service, you can do it as an officer, if you complete your studies first.  Stick with it.  An officers career can be so much more rewarding,  and not just in the military but on your resume after wards !|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Lets see 22, confused as all get out and wants to be a lawyer...go figure! Do us a favor and stay out of the military!|`|rOPPyFNkaa	Don't compare yourself with your friends. Whenever you finish school is fine. I didn't finish until I was 30. I was glad I took the extra time. I knew what I wanted to do and was mature enough to be committed to it. Do what you think is best for you.|`|4uike3ARaa	If you want to serve, but also want to continue your education, consider either the Air Force or the Navy. Both services provide a bit more stable job situation to allow for taking classes.   Depending on your degree major, you might strongly consider sticking it out and getting your degree. Degree in hand, you go down to the Officer Recruiting Station and say, "I'm planning on going to Law School. Would the (fill in the blank) be interested in working out a deal in exchange for my commitment to serve as a JAG lawyer for five or six years?"  A new law graduate rarely gets to actually practice criminal law. In a JAG gig, you'll be the defense one week, the prosecuter the next.   Think about it.  Good Luck!|`|Ioyt2RnYaa	I would stay in the military.  Just because your friends are ahead of you doesn't mean you should leave.  Have you ever heard the phrase "Don't do it just because everyone else it?" Well that applies here, the military is a way to serve yourself, and you country.  Stay in the military until your contract is over.  Then finish your school, or if you are finished look for a good job.  If you still want to, then you can go to school again and get a higher degree. Then again, if you are really important and you become a high ranking officer, you may like the pay and benefits more.  Talk to your parents and you fellow comrades back at your base.|`|d8m44rGaaa	If you are that close, finish your degree and get an officer commission. It will be a lot harder to finish while on active duty, and there is a strong possibility you will have to change to another major and lose a lot of your credit.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Hmm, that's a tough one.    I wouldn't worry about being behind your friends.  Everyone's life goals and priorities are different.  I know 50 year olds who have went back to school, it's not really an issue.    Do you qualify for the new GI bill?  If not, joining the army, even for 3 years would give you that.    Have you thought about maybe waiting and joining later as a JAG corp attorney?  I don't know if there is a special ROTC program for that or what, but maybe there is something.      Go talk to a recruiter and see what you can find out about the JAG corp and what your options are.|`|3IahPYzXaa	This is an interesting decision.   Although you may be behind your friends in formal education, you have far surpassed them in general life experience. The fact that you are looking at the army offers a pretty simple solution. The Army offers 2 year enlistments unlike all of the other branches so if your goal is to serve your country and have some fun than go for that.     Since you obviously are patriotic AND want to pursue a career as a lawyer, why not do both? You can enlist in the JAG program (see source). This seems like the best option and you may want to talk to a recruiter about the program.     Good Luck!!!
04021fc4881460602edfbe93dc6ae44eaa	1 why did the bosnian war start? and how did it start?    USA and Germany wanted to create a Bosnia run by Bosnian Muslims. Started with Croatia attacking Serbs in Bosnia and Bosnian Muslims killing Serbs at a Serb wedding.     2 what where they fighting over?    Serbs were fighting for freedom of self determination. The others were fighting to keep them tied in stupid Bosnia.     3 how did the bosnian war end?    The Dayton peace treaty was signed.      4 who won the war?    USA and Germany.     5 was the winner the good team or bad team?    Bad team won.     6 who where the teams?    Bad team: Islamic mujaheddins, USA, Germany, NATO, Bosnian Croats, Croatia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Bosnian Muslims, parts of UN.    Good team: Serbia, Bosnian Serbs, parts of UN.|`|ndevqFtiaa	It started when the Communist Goverments in Eastern Europe fell apart.   Yugoslavia was a bit like the UK it was held together with at least 6 other countrys. The Serbs had control over all the other countrys, a bit like how England runs Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland    Serbian Nationalist politicians didnt want to loose all the Serb controlled areas of Yugoslavia and decided to arm Serbs in other places of Yugoslavia like Bosnia and Croatia.    As communism fell apart the democratic leader in Bosnia were chosen along ethnic land e.g if you were a Muslim you voted for a Muslim, if you were a Serb you would vote for a Serb.    In Bosnia the Muslims won the elections. The Serbians their called the Bosnian Serbs didnt want to live in a Bosnia ruled by Bosnia and decided to make their own country in Bosnia and call it Bosnian Serb republic. The Croats done the same thing and started rebelling against the Bosnian muslim goverment and wanted to create a Bosnian Croat state.    It was a 3 sided war Bosnian Muslim V Croat V Serb     The Bosnian Muslims and Croats won after the world got sickened with what the Bosnian Serbs were doing (They were armed by the Yugoslav army, the Muslims were sanctioned) the Serbs put Muslims & Croats into Concentration camps and raped many many women and expelled many many people.    NATO launched airstrikes on the Bosnians Serbs and forced them to the negotiating table after ignoring the mass murders of the Serbs for almost 5 years.    Eventually they decided to form a coalition goverment with Bosnian Muslims and Croats working together and the Bosnian Serbs having their own seperate Republic.    The evil ones were the Serbians, the good ones the Muslim and Croats.    btw. what Ethnic group are you?
gvukdlOjaa	Before you make Captain, there's a pretty good chance you'll be involved in combat if you're in a combat arms MOS.  IF you're deployed into a combat zone, of course.    As you increase in rank, the chances of you being involved in combat goes down, unless you're one of those Battalion Commanders going through a mid-life crisis who purposely puts themselves in danger to make General.    I know from experience.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	In Vietnam, infantry butterbars had a life expectancy of next to nothing.|`|AA10624373	If there is combat to be seen, it is very likely that a 2nd Lieutenant would be seeing some.  Maybe not as much as the teams, and squads in the platoon, but they fill the role of Platoon Leader in Combat MOS. Eherever their platoon is, they won't be too far away. If an Infantry Company's combat mission is engagement, the platoon Leader's responsibility is to lead his platoon through the mission.  Often, close contact with enemy is unavoidable.

2fn7tbrxaa	No.  It was mishandled, but its goals were good (except for the annexation of Canada).  Both England and France were seizing our commerce shipping, but the British were also taking sailors off of our ships, even our ships of war.  Negotiations were going nowhere, and we were led to believe that we would gain from this decision.  However, England was able to fight both the US and France, especially since Napoleon was more concerned with land engagements than naval engagements.  Our own course of action should have been to build a newer and larger fleet, and then effectively attack British shipping. This would have kept their navy busy, and would have hindered their efforts of invasion.  This would have given us more time to build a coastal defense that would have been able to repel an invasion by English forces.    Unfortunately, none of the goals were realized, and only the borders of Maine and Washington state were agreed upon.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Why would anyone oppose something that happened almost 200 years ago?

yX4xVukPaa	It varies depending on what jurisdiction you're in.  In the UK there can be two differences:    1. Difference in Intent - Murder requires a specific intent to kill or cause really serious bodily harm to the victim. Manslaughter can be committed both by gross negligence or by recklessly committing a dangerous and unlawful act (those to being called "involuntary manslaughter).    2. There are three partial defences which reduce Murder to Voluntary Mansalughter, even though the defendant fulfills all the elements required for murder: Killing in pursuance of a Suicide Pact, Diminished Responsibility and Provocation.     Similar sorts of category in other jurisdictions some times appear as lesser "degrees" of murder, as do lesser levels of intent|`|usltkMnwaa	Based on intention.     Accidentally kill someone out of negligence = manslaughter (i.e., car accident)    Intentionally hill someone = murder. (i.e., premeditated murder)|`|RrmO1xkuaa	Murder is usually defined as the "unlawful killing of another with malice aforethought (or "an abandoned and malignant heart"). Malice aforethought refers to the perpetrator's intention of doing harm.  Manslaughter is also a form of criminal homicide. The difference between murder and manslaughter is in the element of intent. In order to commit voluntary manslaughter, a person must have committed a homicide, but have acted in the "heat of passion."|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	the difference is the element of intent.  if you shoot someone intentionally, that's murder.  if you are shooting a gun and you accidentally hit someone and they die, that's manslaughter.  murder can be defined as the intentional killing of another
Vu7kCPesaa	A company should be able to hire anyone they determine to be the best for the job.|`|AA11622716	1.  Your opinion is just that.  There is nothing wrong with hiring only people that have the physical ability to do the job.  If the company assumes that some folks do not have ability to do the job, then that applicant could have a claim.  The fact that no older folk have been hired for the job does not tend to prove that the company discriminates based on age.  It is equally likely that they discriminate based on ability.  2.  Yes you can be fired for voicing your opinion.  If you have a contract that governs the conditions under which you can be fired, you can enforce that contract.  If not, then you can quit or be fired at any time for any reason.  3.  Even with a contract, I can't imagine a contract that would protect you from encouraging a lawsuit against the company, even if you were honest about it.  An employer can impose a duty of loyalty.  There are some protections for whistle blowers, but that does not apply to those who encourage private litigation.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	Yikes!    You are lucky to still have a job IMHO.    Your job is not to issue legal opinions on behalf or even about the company. You should refer such questions to those whose job it is to answer them.    Based on the facts you provide, your opinion is not well founded anyway.    The guy was probably passed over for the job because it is a strenuous job and for whatever reason, that you are not privy too, he was either deemed not capable of doing the work, or there was some other reason.    Every company I have ever worked in with more than one person, ne employees were trained at orientation to not answer personnel questions, but to refer them to the appropriate person.    I'd say you have exposed your company to a very serious charge and it is quite possible this guy was fishing for even the slightest corroborating evidence in order to file a lawsuit, or at least threaten one.    As a manager, there is not really much I would fire someone for on the spot, but this would make me take a deep breath an think hard about it for a weekend. Even them, I would probably rely on the advice of company attorneys as to how to proceed. At the very least, a stern warning and retraining for you and probably everyone would be in order, and that is disruptive even if no lawsuit ever materializes.    The EEOC will not be interested, because by your own explanation, the company has a very good record of hiring all age ranges when appropriate.    Like I said, you are very very lucky to still be employed.|`|f9J0UvYIaa	Yes certain jobs are excempt to these laws, cus if he injured himself and then said i am older and more fragile, they are in trouble, sadly the older you are the less you can do, its all above board, if still unsure phone CAB|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	There are probably strength and endurance requirements that few men over the age of 50 could meet for the job in question.  As long as those requirements are job related. and by your description of the job they are, it is perfectly legal to enforce those requirements.    Yes, you company can reprimand you for giving you opinion on this matter, especially if you are a member of management.  Your opinion is based on only the knowledge you have ... not the entire base of knowledge available.    I was in a similar position once.  I worked in a factory where they were having frequent lay offs.  A memo came out cautioning everyone in middle management and high level support positions (I was high level support) not to talk to the press about the situation in the plant, as we do not have all of the information necessary to make a press release.  Just my luck, I walked right into an interview with the local news leaving the plant the very day I read the memo.  If I had answered the questions of the press, I would probably have been included in the next batch of lay offs, and rightly so.  As it was I played "good company man" and referred their questions to the corporate media information officer.    Stating your belief when you do not have all the information on a situation at your workplace can, and sometimes does, get you into trouble!

And her daughter is a legal United States citizen.|`|AA12191521	possibly because she is not racist and has nothing against Hispanic people. She just has a problem with illegal immigration. Why is it so hard for liberals to understand being concerned about the law being violated. Nobody has a problem with people who enter this country legally. It is the ones breaking the law that put an undo burden on our economy. It doesn't matter if its an illegal immigrant from, Canada, Guatamala, Nigeria or Japan. They are all breaking the law. This is not a racial issue. It is a legal issue. And an economic issue.

I will be much happier when those crooks have their Royal butts 6 feet under along with their stupid ideas.

What about the people who are being thrown out on the street and/or losing their jobs!  Hypocrites's what they are!  thanks for bringing this up...and WHY DOES OBAMA HAVE TO GO ALONG? He has a job to do for goodness sake, not be scout leader!  Oh, I get it now....  Obama did say that in America we have the Prominents and the Ordinary people. I guess only D.C. prominents deserve to take Spa Vacations on tax payer money!..

They'd tale a bottle of whiskey and go to the spring and dilute the whiskey, throw in some spices and a bit of mineral oil, and sell it as a cure all for 50 cents a bottle. The whiskey cost $2.85 a fifth then, and the spices maybe 10 cents. They'd make 75 bottles a fifth.   They always had old trucks with a box built on to hold their supplies and would have some form of entertainment. I remember one that had a belly dancer.  O baa ma don't even have a belly dancer to entertain us with. Ain't that a scam?|`|BRyRtQSvaa	This package is nothing but pork and payback and doesn't give anything to making jobs...none.....pur pork, go read it I did!

He wants to be America's Lenin AND Stalin, so push, push, push....|`|FVDhYH6Baa	No|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	You mean, besides for its appalling porkulosity, and the all too obvious nature of the paybacks that comprise it?  Besides for how very much money it comes to, and how very nothing of it will do a single thing for a single citizen, including the damned welfare jokers?  Besides for the fact that it is now aiming at enfranchising the illegal aliens, thus casting most of the Big 0's supporters--at least the legitimately registered voters--under that magic bus of his.  Besides that, one might kindly assign it to impatience to get on with his agenda.  But with one look, the wise among us can clearly perceive what a little study would reveal to the sheeple--Obama is NOT working for the people of this country, in any way, shape or form.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	Lol, thats exactly what he reminds me of. I keep saying I would hire him I ran a shady used car business.|`|ad3de03ebb84f041fee9ea982e0b33c5aa	Because he can!  His arrogance is too much!  He really is annoying isn't he?

I guess Obama just doesn't want to look so stupid.|`|2UnjeOQUaa	At least Obama has read his stimulus plan. It would have been nice if Bush did the same.

Please, get lost like you did for the last administration.|`|W1UHwwsoaa	He is shady and we will all soon see how bad this is going to get. How many empty promises has he made now? Congress told us there will not be free government health care, no big tax cuts till 2011, and now he wants to tell CEO's how much they can make. Wow... He is just like a used cars salesmen! When will the lies stop? I would have more respect for him if he would just tell it like it is and stop with the "please vote for me" act. You already won.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Yes, isn't Obama who quoted "we need change", different people in the white house etc.......didn't he go and choose everyone who was under Bill Clinton?  People who voted for Obama will see the clear picture before long.  Our country is in trouble.|`|cDaxALCFaa	I do believe Bush was actually a car salesman before he became Governor of Texas...seriously.

Example:  for years, PNC has been buying up and/or aquiring small banks.  Last year they got the one in my tiny town that had been operating since early 1900's.  Yesterday, they announced they would be laying of almost 6,000 employees.      Can anyone explain or show me th logic?  Can you fix that one?|`|uPNP1xzpaa	hahahaha...that is a happy idea, very cute.

Lets do it now...|`|oKU7tFWyaa	Do they get two 10 minute breaks, and 30 minute lunch?|`|6FpUuLknaa	If employers would pay their workers a decent wage with some benefits then real Americans wouldn't mind doing them, especially with so many jobs being lost.  Also, there wouldn't be any point in hiring illegals, and the employers wouldn't have to worry about their work force being rounded up and shipped back.  Manual laborers, dishwashers, fruit pickers, etc.

It is, perhaps, in the works all ready.  I don't know how else to explain the illogical and insane ideals that they come up with.     To many disregard alleged rumors of socialism among other things, and discredit based on the word of one - there only words, right?  So why can't people actually learn about things and people they elect before casting that ballot.  Those who defend and say it isn't so - have they really took the time to analyze this and actually consider it by researching it and learning?  I don't think so.    Why do they think the dollar has lost value over the years?  Regardless of the reasoning, the increase of dollars lower its value.

It will not do any more than put things deeper in the hole, and feed more into the pockets of the already rich thieves that caused this whole mess to begin with. When any company, bank, auto maker, parts manufacture, or whatever their purpose and product fails because of bad management and utter lack of ethics, morals, or foresight then let them fail and their staff go under along with it. Thereby, and only thereby, can a workable business be created, rather than handing huge amounts of tax payer dollars to the very same morons that created this mess.

85kWzSzuaa	No i didn't, but I am loving every minute of it.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	no   not this  early|`|lRmhwiYpaa	I don't think much about this as I think President Obama is just facing the reality of being the President of the United States    This is a Republic and he has to face a congress that is mostly his own party~  in the end he will get most of what he wants but not everything is going  to work out like he planned    I did not vote for President Obama but I think he should be given a chance to try his programs|`|AA10079277	Yes because he claimed he could do a lot and so many people bought it.  I've been saying here for months.whether you like his policies or not, the president has nowhere near the power people seem to think he has.  He is a basically a cheerleader with veto power.  He cannot write laws.  People just cannot get that concept.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	I knew it'd be pretty bad but this exceeded my expectations. Way to go B. Hussein Obama!|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Yes I did.    The smear machine was geared up well before the election.  Repeatedly accusing the guy of being anti-christ, communist, socialist AND fascist (somehow), a terrorist, a muslim, a liar and this entity to be feared. Such was the centerpiece of the Mccain campaign.    So no im not suprised - the resentment, fear, panic and hatred was in full swing well before he was even elected. It has only gained more momentum now.    He is so far operating out in the open and therefore subject to attack by his detractors. Bush avoided that problem by pursuing policy in secret. Which also had it's reprecussions but of a different nature.|`|AA12212403	Actually, I thought it would happen but was quite surprised that it was this soon.  I am resisting cheers and "I told you so" remarks in public, but can't resist it here.  I told you so, he is not prepared for this job.  He is inexperienced, he's all talk and just can't produce the action.  He's not leading, his answer to not getting support of this bill is to make speaches.  He doesn't have a clue how to really lead.  A sad day for America.  God forbid Bin Laden comes at us right now, we are sitting ducks.  His obvious poor judgement in selecting cabinet members and nievity in picking people who are actually criminals is freightening.  Can't believe so many far left liberals have come crashing down around him.  Who else may fall?  By the way, I think voting for this bill will be the kiss of death for any politician right now.  They know it's sour and if they vote for it, the public will not reelect them.  Yet, Mr. O is pressuring them like crazy.  Wouldn't want to be in their shoes.  I hope all the republicans hang in there and in unison do not give that bill one single vote.  I have never been so proud of them as I have been over this.  Also, does anyone know where Leiberman stands on this bill?  I've not heard a think.  I'd be very interested to know.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You evidently haven't seen him he is doing fine. He is purposely investigating people & as results come in they will be exposed. The republicans are going to have more than tax problems. All the little boys are going to come out of their closet. Obama is going to have a place with people who have integrity. I hope when the sex scandles come out that Obama threatens them to vote as he says or else they will be with Ted Haggard on the talk show circuit....Obama is always going to come out the winner. So I laugh when republicans think they got him on something cause he always somes out on top. Remember when the churchs prayed against him & his convention was great but McCain had storm Gustav. You all will learn that Jesus said Love thy neighbor as thyself cause when we want the worst for someone it comes back to us. So if you see Obama struggling you are going to be the one struggling but he will be find cause he is not struggling except in your mind.|`|ZkMfdTgBaa	No.  He clearly underestimated the hatred from the right and how they would be so quick to put party ahead of country.|`|e7jqokqfaa	Except for the bit where he's not...|`|AA11086243	rope-a-dope baby...    you won't know what hit you until you wake up the hospital...|`|6EB2JDFmaa	I thought he would at least last 22 days...his inexperience is starting to show.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	He's already nominated three people for cabinet positions who've cheated on their taxes and one of 'em is running the IRS! And those are just the ones we know about. So, you be the judge...|`|m1HVh5YUaa	I would have to say that when he took off in his plane with "Change we can believe in" painted on the side and traveled to other countries with all his platitudes and embarrassing American election/American Idol mediocre wishy-washy political speeches in places like Israel, where people have the thousand-yard stare, was when it really hit me that this young skinny kid from Chicago was in way over his head.|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Yes I did. He is unqualified and too inexperienced to be President.|`|f9crUDTwaa	That's an interesting observation... He's not on the ropes , he's just begun . Do you expect the game to be over after 3 weeks ?|`|73kknl3Qaa	says you...most people with a level head don't agree|`|SWxcuGlOaa	Yeah by now Bush was off on holiday playing golf, or was that just after 9/11, can't recall|`|dtiJmx94aa	In over your head at this level!!!! Oh YEAH!!!|`|AA11313983	Yes.  I figured out during the campaign that he intended to continue Bush's policies.  You know, the policies he said were terrible under Bush.  You can't perpetuate bad policies and expect them to work the second (or third) time around.

I want what is good for everyone ...Pork is bad and they know it and don't care.|`|pM81f5tnaa	No, it's not his habit to play either card.  And he doesn't have to.  He has a majority in congress, and the support of the American people,  who realize that time is of the essence.

Not saying it isn't a good idea, nor that it must not be if they're jumping on the bandwagon, but it would give me pause.  Then again, maybe it's just the old reverse psychology.

O baa ma wants to keep it in place so he can maybe be the first Dictator of America.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	From the Great Depression, to the stagflation of the seventies, to the burst of the dotcom bubble last year, every economic downturn suffered by the country over the last 80 years can be traced to Federal Reserve policy. The Fed has followed a consistent policy of flooding the economy with easy money, leading to a misallocation of resources and an artificial "boom" followed by a recession or depression when the Fed-created bubble bursts.    With a stable currency, American exporters will no longer be held hostage to an erratic monetary policy. Stabilizing the currency will also give Americans new incentives to save as they will no longer have to fear inflation eroding their savings. Those members concerned about increasing America's exports or the low rate of savings should be enthusiastic supporters of this legislation.    Though the Federal Reserve policy harms the average American, it benefits those in a position to take advantage of the cycles in monetary policy. The main beneficiaries are those who receive access to artificially inflated money and/or credit before the inflationary effects of the policy impact the entire economy. Federal Reserve policies also benefit big spending politicians who use the inflated currency created by the Fed to hide the true costs of the welfare-warfare state. It is time for Congress to put the interests of the American people ahead of the special interests and their own appetite for big government.|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	http://endthefed.us/projects/repeal_the_...    don't listen to thomas he knows not what he says    ps-never listen to anyone whos souce is wikipedia|`|AA11163314	Because people who support one bad idea also tend to support other bad ideas.|`|EOYLHWATaa	They're just jumping on the band-wagon|`|rDMDRRihaa	If this is true, Obama may be the best president we've ever had.|`|11dGXLchaa	It just goes to show that both parties have nutjobs.

I think that the opponents of the spending stimulus have given him something to fear. It's pretty juvenile to say the same thing over and over in the highest office of the world: I won, get over it. You expect that from teenagers, not from the president. A good leader will take the other side into consideration. Mind you it's not a small minority! His approval rates are falling, so he's gonna make some noise to either distract, or pass something else under the table.   One thing is always a rule of thumb, especially nowadays: consider the source. Why was it crazy when Ron Paul said it and it's roses and perfume when Obamby talks it?  Perhaps it's an attempt to collect credit for someone else's idea.

wVik8Fo7aa	Graham is only interested in himself and his plutocratic friends-and John McCain.  Pure hypocrisy on his part regarding the stimulus bill when last fall he was the head cheerleader for the massive give-a-way to the financial institutions with absolutely no strings attached.

PAh92xBvaa	GPA should be at least a 3.5. You need to be academically strong.    SAT Im pretty sure you need around a 600-650 in each section.    ACT you should get, in total, around a 30-35.    Yup, all honors, and some AP.     At least 1 varsity sport and a club or 2.    Leadership? Join the National Honor Society.    You should do a pretty good amount of community service, totaling around 40-50 hours a year.    The kids that get into Annapolis are the top 5% of their classes academically and are captains of varsity teams. In other words, they dont leave school until like 630 at night.|`|XQDDttvEaa	A good GPA is the start. 3.5 or higher is the best. Have decent SAT or ACT scores, they don't have to be Ivy League worthy. Have around a 600 on math and verbal and have a 27 on the ACT. Challenge yourself by taking the hardest courses, because they will take that into account that you are striving to be a good student. Be involved in many extracurriculars and sports, and try to do well in sports. Do as much community service as you can.  Annapolis usually accepts around 1200, andn 10-12 thousand apply. However, these numbers are deceiving. I'm sure you know you need a nomination from one of your congressman. Out of the 12,000 or so applicants, about 3,000 have nominations, which  means if you get a nomination you have about a 1 and 3 chance. Good Luck.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	Candidates receiving appointments to  Annapolis are all around great kids. You can find the answers to  these questions on the USNA website in the frequently asked questions section under "Admissions."   http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/faq.htm  The several  tiered nature of Service Academy Admissions is  also important to understand. In particular the implications of  what is stated at Step  10.  http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/steps10.h...  If a student has the academic qualifications to compete successfully  for admissions at an Ivy League or other highly selective university he will be offered an LOA. (Scholastically qualified also includes  in  context of  athletic recruit or affirmative action status just as in the Ivy League.)  What is not stated is that candidates with a nomination from a MOC(Rep or Senator) and with an LOA offer are not charged off to the MOC.      Each MOC can have 5 appointed cadets/mids at USNA, 5 at USMA and 5 at USAFA at any point in time. When a vacancy occurs due to graduation or other separation of an appointed cadet/mid,  a MOC  can nominate 10 candidates to fill the vacancy. Those who do not receive LOA Offers are in  competition within the nominating source aka local competition for MOC nominations for the appointment or appointments.    A MOC can:    A) Name a Principal Nomination and rank the Alternates.  B) Name a Principal Nomination and not rank the Alternates.  C) Offer a slate of alternate nominations.  [About 25% of MOC  name Principal Nominations.]    If a Principal Nomination is named and he is found to be scholastically, medically and physically qualified, and he passes his Blue/Gold interview, he receives the appointment even if there are alternates with higher whole person scores. If he is not found to be fully  qualified,  the next highest ranked alternate who is fully qualified receives the appointment. If a Principal Nomination is not named, the candidate with the highest whole person score receives the Appointment.  As the Academy receives information regarding Appointments that have been declined,  fully qualified alternates are in national competition  for Appointments until the class is filled.     Also not stated at  10 is  that the Academies Congressional Liaison Office will already have informed the MOC's of a candidate receiving an LOA Offer in an effort to secure a nomination. Even if a nomination is not forthcoming from a candidates MOC's, the Academy will secure a nomination from some source including the Secretary of the Navy as long as the Candidate applied to all nominating sources available to him.     Due to the nature of  LOA offers,  and  the varying levels of competition within nominating sources for appointments,  and Principal Nominations, overall average statistics are not really that useful except to indicate where the range of scholastic qualifications to be eligible for an LOA Offer based solely on academics in a normal context not affected by athletic recruit or affirmative action status might be.  http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/se...  [Middle 50% means that 50% of Mids in the Freshman class were in this range. 25% were below this range. 25% were above this range.]
sI3kqp7xaa	Gibbs is flabby tool, but at least he admits he's a pawn of the Democratic Party.

HLHHM4Mtaa	I don't doubt that parts of the plan are actually needed, but if one has to make an emergency trip across country because granny is dying it just doesn't seem practical that they would stop off at every tourist destination along the way and spend a week or two and essentially that's what this plan does by granting billions to this and billions to that.  None of which have anything to do with seeing granny one more time before she goes.  ...and if Nazi Pelosi and Harry Greed (love your creativity!) ran their personal lives like they try to run the Congress, they would both be homeless.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	the best economic stimulus would be to put the money in the tax payers hands and let them spend the money.

Subject: Economic Stimulus Payment    This year, taxpayers will receive an Economic Stimulus Payment.  This is a  very exciting new program that I will explain using the Q and A format:    Q.  What is an Economic Stimulus Payment?  A.  It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.    Q.  Where will the government get this money?  A.  From taxpayers.    Q.  So the government is giving me back my own money?  A.  Only a smidgen.    Q.  What is the purpose of this payment?  A.  The plan is that you will use the money to purchase a high-definition TV  set, thus stimulating the economy.    Q.  But isn't that stimulating the economy of China?  A.  Shut up.    Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the US economy by spending  your stimulus check wisely:   If you spend that money at Wal-Mart, all the money will go to China.     If you spend it on gasoline it will go to the Arabs.     If you purchase a computer it will go to India.     If you purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala.     If you buy a car it will go to Japan.     If you purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan.    And none of it will help the American economy.  We need to keep that money  here in America!  You can keep the money in America by sp ending it at yard  sales, going to a baseball game, or spend it on prostitutes, beer or  tattoos, since those are the only businesses still in the US :) :)  !!!|`|wnzK56fiaa	altogether - the last one didn't do anything|`|9K3F4JFSaa	Totally against it.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	Against stimulating the dwindling illusion altogether. Thanks for asking.|`|B1XT60WEaa	The following is a complete list of all government programs that work.     1|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	I am against the stimulus plan as it is.  Congress Majority has a real problem with the word PRIORITY, as does Obama evidently.   These items that are going to be set for 2010 and such can be looked at LATER, they are NOT, repeat, NOT a help right NOW.  They should not be in an EMERGENCY STIMULUS PACKAGE - they should simply be looked at later as any other legislative bill.  Complete with debates, research and discussion as to the need - benefit vs risk.    There may be some good things in there - but they do not reflect the need right now and that is what this bill is suppose to be about.    To be honest, I think the first stimulus should have never went through either.  Look what has happen - at least half of it - they over paid and LOST the money - it did NO GOOD.  Do we want a repeat of this?  Throw money at something and say oops?!    Maybe they should just leave it alone and let the economy recover on its own with no huge stimulus.  The Government screws us every chance they get - it is rather sickening and the whole lot of them need to go that push this ridiculous plan!|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	The stimulus plan is a horrible idea and in order for the americans to get back to where they need to be the government needs to print its own currency. Why would you want to create inflation on top of more inflation. Also the stimulus money would go toward stupid stuff like hollywood certain smoking programs, it's stupid. It needs to be abolished period and let the americans pay this dumb fed off and tell the government to pull out of wars so that they don't have to get a loan that they cant pay for. The interest paid on the loans comes out of the american people's pockets making the americans slaves to the private banking industries. Hollywood is not important neither is smoking but the gov. and fed that controls its citizens think it is. It's the major stuff that has bee merketed that needs to be saved what about the people? Forget hollywood I can go days without watching movies. I can't stand merchants sometimes.|`|pZmdGcf7aa	We need a plan to get this country moving  but this one isn't the right one.    We may need to have some bran cereal for breakfast but we sure don't need an enema!|`|koSLFtSbaa	No is any plan works, we need it and our economy needs it with the so called work force we have and such.  So any plan that will work we need it.  The Congress is going to have to get busy and do something that they rarely do.  Work.  And if we get the proper one it will help everyone.|`|AA11426616	They should give it to the schools and for the roads that need to be fixed.|`|twPZBsH2aa	This is like defining the meaning of the word "is" as Clinton did.     To call this fiasco a "stimulus plan" is to have taken a sip from the cool-aid bottle.    Obama could give everyone a folding chair so they won't have to stand in soup lines, they can take their chair and move it along as they get closer to the soup kitchens that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.|`|z8kAKvGKaa	I personally think it is highway robbery and they are fulfilling their personal agenda's all in the name of stimulating the economy- pig barrel spending spree.  The neo-marxist are going to do anything they can to destroy our country so they can implement socialism.  Many democrats are starting to figure out that this is not what they were anticipating with voting in this scammer- yet the true marxist in our society know darn well what they were voting for.  Impeachment is in order for all these fools!|`|wMFfGkIRaa	It is a plan to spend spend spend and you know who pays for it???WE DO..GOD knows the DEM-O Crats do not like to pay there taxes!|`|ad3ORARNaa	Every time the government tries to help the economy they fail because the economy in itself is the only thing that can fix the economy.  Basically what I am saying is the only way to fix the economy is to leave it alone and through supply and demand it will straighten out.|`|AA10083573	Stimulus? Stimulus? The only thing this will stimulate are all the pet projects that the politicians want for their special interest groups that voted their lazy, good-for-nothing carcasses into a life-long position of entitlement. The only thing that our government can safely pass is gas, and I even wonder how much THAT would cost. We'd better be careful, or they'll find a way to tax flatulence! So, to answer your question (even though I think I already did), I am very much against any action that our government takes that involves spending our taxes to "fix" this financial fiasco. It's like putting a wad of bubble gum into a crack in the Hoover Dam (did you see that commercial?). The "fix" would be to repeal NAFTA. Yes, I am going to keep repeating this until the dumb thing is done. This is the best way to "fix" this problem, keeping our jobs at home where they originated from. I think we should put all these clowns on a deserted island and let them go crazy taxing themselves silly. Could be the next best reality show! |`|gUTGUQJDaa	I am completely against any stimulus package other than reducing debt and cutting taxes.
BpcgaJd4aa	Those are mostly Conservative values|`|LzPhdri5aa	Sounds like you're a pragmatic principled libertarian.    Just the kind of philosophy I like.|`|bmCInR5qaa	You're certainly not a liberal if you need to be told what to think.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	well I guess you need to determine what issues on that list are most important. Seing that you put this -  -very small government  -low taxes   -free-enterprise. I think the government is there to protect the system, not guide it  In the beginning... it would indicate those are priorities and so you would be conservative... social issues are not as important as financial ones.|`|shtP63traa	Fiscally, you seem conservative, but more liberal on social issues.

With this kind of system, issues such as tax breaks for corporations, health care, affirmative action and so on, wouldn't even appear the same as they do now.     Conservationism can be handled by the private sector, and is.     The private sector is dealing with the education system evident in the growing number of home schooled and alternative school children, providing competition to the mediocre state schools. You can see how the NEA has reacted since government agencies do not think they have to compete or provide high standards. They are AGAINST homeschooling.    Of course, without the government induced rat-race and the large chunk of pay taken from the IRS, people would find more time and money to ensure a better education for their kids anyway.     Casting aside Obama and McCain, since there is no choice there regarding your first 3 principles, the question is, would you compromise any of those first 3 principles so that gays could marry? To protect a stretch of land? To close gitmo? To introduce or protect the death penalty?    It's not liberal and conservative since both can mean the same thing at one time depending on who is defining them. For instance, the liberal founders of the US defined it as you did, liberalism is a free society in which there is a free market, low taxes, small government, etc. Many conservatives today say this is what they believe in, that a conservative government will ensure a liberal society. But then other liberals think the government is supposed to have liberal freedom to implement law and regulation as they please, which of course creates a conservative, restrained society. So besides these relative terms, are you for individual freedom or are you for the alternative?|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Well informed. Closer to a Libertarian,.|`|EJVKqFiHaa	You shouldn't let anyone define or tell you who you are.|`|EOYLHWATaa	Your neither, your a Libertarian     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...

We want to keep those global big shots in America right, not India or china? So they need incentives to stay...    5 - sorry I should further explain this one too.  Humans before animals... but demand respect and responsibility for the future of the environment.    6, 7, 8 check    9, and 10 -> are personal, but I agree    religion and politics shouldn't matter anyway    *To your "extra" comments:    A lot of moderate republican's went out and voted for local representations only this last election.  They were not fans of Palin.  We generally are for the death penalty.      But Gitmo... well that's really a question of an idealist vs. realist.  The idealist side of me is very happy, but realistically I see it as a neccessary evil.

(This does NOT include all the people that pay taxes throughout the year and then get it all back come refund time)     So really, only the people that make quite a bit of money (100K+) actually PAY federal taxes.      I would guess that if only they were voting, Obama probobly would have lost.|`|ymCX4zuOaa	THEY DID VOTE, THAT IS HOW WE GOT OBAMA!!! NOT BAD.|`|VOxXVI2paa	You imply that people who are Democrats do not pay taxes.
HzVE4kz1aa	uh.. illegal immigration is not a significant problem in the US right now, sorry to break it to you.  the problem is the term "illegal".  we have a huge number of "undocumented" workers, without which this country would cease to function.  we encouraged these people (many of them mexicans) to come accross the border for seasonal working picking our produce and working in our meat packing industry or service jobs in our hotels restaurants etc.  So when politicians talk about "comprehensive immigration reform" it actually means giving these people rights.  Most of them are paying payroll taxes, just denied other rights.  Only the hate-spewing right wing radio promotes this "deport em all" type nonsense.  Don't listen to anyone that doesn't give you both sides of the story.  They're full of it.  Listen to both sides, then form your own informed opinions.|`|2932956ec7662d7544675f368775f540aa	Because the liberal bleeding hearts will not allow common sense solutions to dealing with these criminals.

I'm going to bed on that note...|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Because the US gives them free health care and benefits. Obama has proposed to give illegals stimulus checks. I took my son to the doctor one afternoon. There was a family of Mexicans with a Medicaid card. Their doctor visit for 5 kids was free. I had to pay $125 for 1 child. Later, I took my son to Toys"R" Us. This same Mexican family had 3 buggies piled full of electronics and toys. They paid cash for these items. I watched to see what the total amount of their purchase was. It was over $900. I was furious that the government paid for their chilren's doctor visit while they had enough cash to pay for more than $900.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Because our government have no back bone pure and simple. All they need to do is enforce our laws, secure the border and stop giving freebies to all illegals.|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	Can you spell LIBERALS?|`|ljmE8eLLaa	Obama just signed a health care bill that pays for medical expenses for the children of illegal immigrants. There's a reason.|`|2d17c2ff5cd28b3fd169e4ba5aa17f4caa	Because we allow it.|`|FpioJ7F5aa	I agree.  I have been pushing that way for a very long time.    Mr. Certoff told the world that most gangs are Hispanic, and most gang members are illegal aliens.  Congress sits on their hands and we don't have what the the lobby groups want, and we sure don't have what the American People want.  And things are dangerous: one immigration bill out there will excuse the illegal aliens for document fraud.. completely, and the American Taxpayer will pay that tab in a big way.      Good luck.|`|I5SypMlsaa	idiots|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	it's because everyone wants to come here and our "leaders" are so spineless that they are afraid if they get tough they'll lose the mexican vote
8Mi15cTtaa	tax the product you are trying to get people to stop using - brilliant! You are getting rid of a source of revenue as people either quit or die.|`|kprKXEOSaa	The thing I don't get about it is that smokers are vilified, and we all know smoking is evil and if you smoke you should quit.  If everyone quit, where would the money come from, then?    My state is also debating adding another big tax onto cigarettes, it seems like it was more than $1 a pack.  I think it was to fund highway construction projects.  I guess smokers are an easy target, it's a vice tax, right?  They've got to have their cigarettes, we've got to have our roads and kids have got to have free health care, right?|`|AA11702773	You and I know it will end up funded by the general fund just like when New Mexico tried it.  Smokers found ways to get cigarrettes with lower taxes.|`|e19ukSO0aa	Seeing as how cigarette smoke directly contributes to worsening health, it's prudent.|`|shtP63traa	It's a great thing to give people reasons to quit smoking.  Smoking-related illnesses are a MASSIVE drain on our health care system.  When we get people to quit self-inducing cancer, then insurance companies will be spending less on treatments - and that means everyone's premiums increase at a slower rate.|`|2jNQhT7laa	... No. According to conservative "logic," people need to treated according to their "choices." Smokers made a conscious choice to begin smoking. They should have known the consequences. Just like people who have sex should know the consequences, and people who commit crimes should know the consequences. Second-hand smoke is a serious health problem for children and other adults. Therefore, I see nothing wrong with taxing cigarettes, which have nothing to do with health care, nothing to do with staying healthy, and which are not necessary for one to live a decent life.  ________    P.S. If you haven't learned that basically everything "hurts" poor people more than it "hurts" rich people, you must be orbiting Mars.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	No it is a great plan.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	People who smoke.  That is most likely to be hurt by this.    There is a fundamental flaw in lowering taxes and telling people to shop while we're at war too...but we do that don't we?|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	It's just the start of helping the middle class and poor out for Obama..he can call it what he wants it's just a tax.  He claims he's for the middle class and poor but you just wait there is more to come..especially if that stimulus package gets passed.|`|9FI7zaKraa	it is an unfair tax due to the fact it will first hit the weakest segment of our society, second. if people stop smoking they will have to seek taxes from elsewhere, thus the no smokers who imposed this tax will end up paying for it.|`|Y3ZAtgkXaa	Nope. Cigarette junkies are a huge burden on the health care system. If they won't stop using their drug of choice, might as well let them pay for kids' healthcare while they're at it.|`|k1W70RHFaa	Yes.    Cigarette smokers are actually decreasing.    If he uses that as revenue to finance children's health care, where will he get the money when there are too little smokers left?      It's not a stable plan.|`|AA12176505	Absolutely.  The real question is:    When everyone quits smoking, how will this program be financed?  If you think that children won't get sick anymore when everyone stops smoking, you're nuts.|`|3TjiJls7aa	I don't think anyone will quit smoking because of a price increase.  We need to pay for children's healthcare somehow and why not with money from smokers?  Statistics show that lower income people do smoke more, and they are more likely to need government funded healthcare, so in a way they will be paying for there own children's healthcare...why not!?  One of the few taxes you can choose to not pay!!!|`|2MfFXmNMaa	My dumass is still smoking after years, and prices have more than tripled.|`|QoGVbSZ4aa	Yes it is.  Increasing tobacco tax will likely drive down the smoking rate, increase bootlegging and other criminal activity thus not accomplishing the intended desire.|`|a954809e4f18646ae09e77b29aee6dbfaa	Its a flaw to raise taxes anywhere. The constitutionally fundamental right thing to do is not pour money into a shady down payment on nationalized health care.  What don't you dopes get .  Government is already to BIG!!  The  highest corporate taxes in the world.  IN THE WORLD!! And you wonder why company's leave. I got news for you, if a company is being strangled by high taxes and unions and they cant compete on a global market.. Then they will leave.  Less govmnt= BIG LIBERTY|`|Kt9O1ntUaa	the tax will hurt poor people and as smoking declines they will increase taxes as they are now trying tp raise the fed. tax on gasoline as usage declines.|`|axHyoVqGaa	For this program to be financed, we are going to need 22 million new smokers.  With the way our federal and state governments are cracking down on it, that will never happen, so eventually we will all have our taxes raised to help pay for it.  However, until that time, the majority of the cost for this bill will be shouldered by smokers.  That might be ok, but you have to consider that the majority of smokers happen to be low income Americans.  Isn't that just wonderful.|`|5d1b02ab1bdd8a707c44ed1acdcec31daa	I think there is a huge flaw in this. I am not a smoker, but there already is a put down of smokers as it is.   Why don't they address the real issue of the Obesity in this country and charge people an extra $.62 for a big mac if you are overweight.   I myself am overweight and loosing weight every week but, weight is more of a health issue than any smoker and it would generate more $$$ for their health care program. Make the people who are costing the most pay taxes on their bad habits.     People who smoke poor or rich aren't usually going to stop smoking no matter the price so this does hurt the children of the poor who's parents buy cigs instead of food.

Your rep lied.|`|JthubNIsaa	Who can believe anything Obama says?|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	You'll find out.  There is an amazing amount of garbage put out, and frankly I don't know what they are going to settle on to try and keep us from going under until the economy picks back up, but the bills are due in 2010 from the Bush's war, which was cleverly put off until he was out of office, so the next guy could get stuck with the tab.  He played, we pay, and Obama will get the bill.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Obama is an idiot, anything to kill the economy faster, thats what he will do!|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	A state rep? He has no special knowledge.

This Osama got a real ego problem. You dont hang with Chi-Town scum your entire political carreer and not have it squirt on you.  Hes a phony just like the rest of the dems!  He claims hes for the middle class.  Well how do you pay for Rationized health care??  The top 5 % . I dont think so.  Canada pays 54% income tax alone! Not to mention the high sales tax and every other economic destroying tax.  We pay 18-22% here.  Thats a difference of like 200 bucks a week.  I pay 220 a month for my entire family.  Not only that Im not responsible for some gay guy who got aids or some nasty junk on his junk!  Let him pay for his awful behavior and bad choices in life!!|`|QeV1ZkrPaa	See they don't raise the taxes on the big stuff right away like income etc, but they will tax the hell out of ya on the other stuff like cars, clothes cigarettes, gas.  So the taxes are raised it just doesn't come out of your check.  You have to pay it on the stuff you want to buy..  It's a lot easier for it to be done on the little stuff because it's not as noticeable... example cigarettes in VA $3.00 a pack in MA almost 7.00 and most of that is taxes.  And pretty soon they are going to try tax  for the mileage you put on your car as another way to get more $.  Like you don't pay enough tax on a vehicle every year as it is...|`|uBW5xrK1aa	thats why he's using the federal reserve for now.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	How would a state rep. know about a President's plans; my guess is that he or she meant to say "that I know of", but they're a politician, and realize that implies that they actually do, when they clearly either believed, or wanted you to believe that he didn't.    P.S. despite everything I wrote above I think Obama would be a great president and deserving of our full confidence, even if he wasn't our first African-American president.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	State Reps don't know what the President plans on doing until the President actually says something.  I've worked with these people.  They're not as "in the know" as you apparently think they are.
n5wvy5FYaa	YES and you're not even touching on the specifics which would piss off alot of tax payers. Sad to see so many Americans believe this crap will put money in "tax payers" hands. Not hardly. Have you seen the revision cutting billions of dollars from states running out of money? Some states didn't even see money for roads like they were told. This is another knee jerk band aid on a problem that will not work in the long run. And there's no guarantee it will work in the short-term. But hurry up and support it because O'bummer is playing on your fears big time...and he wants to look like he's doing something for you.|`|knO3cmiKaa	Yes to say the least|`|fgSZEyAyaa	LAISSEZ FAIRE!!!    I could scrape a good 815 billion off this plan and get the same results|`|RRTDRSw1aa	Might as well have a bonfire with truckloads of currency. Insanity!

You can't pull money out of your asss.    It will do nothing to stimulate the economy what so ever.|`|aJoF9PYHaa	This is not the time to be speding so much money.  It will probably be printed, causing even more inflation.    Thomas R - "Dying to death"?   Aren't you being a little bit overdramatic?  The economy isn't in good shape, but it isn't because of capitalism, and it isn't as bad as the mainstream media makes it out to be.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Given that you're including things like Medicade and Cobra.....No.    It isn't.    It does the economy little good to save it if people are freezing to death, starving to death or dying to death.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	I'm sure that 'green' projects are just too difficult to imagine -- for some folks -- how much CO2 emissions they save, less dependence on coal and petroleum, or the jobs that the green industries will create. Yah. That's such a tough concept, HUH?    and 1.7 for the National park system? that's about a penny an acre, money that Bush wouldn't spend, as are many of the other items on your list    honeybees: they "only" pollinate 25% or more of our food crops: no bees = no almonds, oranges, grapefruit, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. I guess you haven't kept up with the mysterious disease that has been killing bees faster than apiarists (look it up!) can keep up with.  hence the "honeybee insurance."    It seems obvious, at least to me, that most people who oppose these things are not really doing their own research, they're relying on that obese drug-addled thrice-divorced rabid fascist windbag radio guy or the ever-smarmy Sham Hannyjob or Bill-O The Clown.    On the other hand, those smug union-busting Southern Senators and their lickspittle sycophants at the non-union Chamber(pot) of Commerce are requiring that the "Buy American" provision NOT be in the StimPack...that smacks of treason to me, certainly shortsightedness at the very least. Maybe Toyota and BMW and Honda are holding Mitch McConnell and his cohorts hostage? They are being peckersniffian, according to all objective reports. Or maybe they don't care that our bridges, overpasses, etc., will now have "Made In China' (or India) stickers on them. Obama is trying to EMPLOY AMERICANS in AMERICAN JOBS. That's the easy part to understand... I hope.    Let's see what happens to those jerks in 2010 when re-election time comes around and they have to explain themselves to their broke, hungry, needy, unemployed, foreclosed-on constituents.    and that pesky Women Infant Children program for food, etc. Yah. Maybe if Bush had spent a few bux on sex ed, condoms, etc, there would be fewer little boogers needing help... but no-o-o-o-o-o. Now the Fed Gov feeds them; after all, no matter how they got here, I'm sure that you don't babies dying of starvation, dehydration, etc... don't you? Surprise me and say no, please.  .|`|mT6b7INZaa	Women like Obama's impressive package.       Women have given him the nickname PRESIDENT JOHNSON !

The National Parks, Arts, Smithsonian, Hybrids, Historic preservation, I would support all those things.    NOT, however, on a bill disguised as a means to stimulate our economy.     The only things I could see as economically useful would be the parts which pertain to agriculture, livestock, and unemployment...    The main thing is that they finally have the votes to push through all this crap they have been sitting on for years.  But unnecessary or untimely Government spending is the LAST thing that is going to stimulate our economy!!!!|`|0eFSeap5aa	Stimulus packages never work.  People assume that it's free money, that when people get this money they will go out and spend it and thus perk up the economy.  What they fail to comprehend is all that money had to come from someone, and those people will now not have the money so they won't spend it.  Net effect, no new spending.    The spending we need is investment in businesses that will create the wealth we consume, and by extension require labor, which leads to more jobs.  Most of this is list is just consumption, it is wealth spent once and gone.    If I ever get in charge of the government, the very first program I would totally eliminate is the National Endowment for the Arts.  Anyone who thinks this program is a stellar idea should sit down with single mothers struggling to make ends meet and explain that part of the wealth that would have made their lives better went to some performance art.  Besides you can never have great art without suffering and I figure cutting off these folks tax money is a good place to start that suffering.|`|JQwL50JMaa	Yes.  It is.|`|ljmE8eLLaa	His wife said it's not nearly big enough.|`|gGTk0hkVaa	I smell bbq PORK!!!!!!!!!|`|w4kdTalPaa	Oh you meant this package.

T0pkW783aa	Obama doesn't have a clue!!  You are correct in your observations; he is leaning on Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to guide him into the halls of Liberal change and is dragging all the rest of us down with him.  He wants to cut the military spending; raise taxes and funding for those who don't even work and provide them with some pocket money; all compliments of the tax payers who have no vote in the matter.  As far as terrorist attacks, well, didn't you hear; Obama thinks we need to talk it over with the terrorist leaders and learn to get along.  He thinks that by closing Gitmo and being "fair" to the terrorist prisoners, that we will be doing the right thing.  Move all those who want more than anything else to kill all the Americans they can, to a low level prison in the US.  Does that make a bit of sense to you?  It sure doesn't to me and I am not at all pleased with any of the decisions he has made so far.  He is an empty suit and has nothing to offer this Nation.  What a poor choice to lead!!  God help us all.|`|g5FbtzNTaa	A withheld vote is a mute voice in a sea of opposing views.

The Republicans continue to act like sore losers and trying to exert influence when they know they don't have any.

The Democrats can do whatever they want, and are showing they could care less about the Republicans or the amount spent.    900 Billion to save 3 million jobs. Do the math. It's not about jobs, but about programs that are so dear to Liberals. You know, the ones who employ vasts amount of people and bureaucracy, satisfy the patronage and votes, and changes nothing in poor, violent neighborhoods. That's because it's a feeding frenzy on the funds as they make their way to the street. Everyone knows this, but somehow these people don't  care.

Absolutely not.|`|CG5NnL8Yaa	Why didn't they "trim" their Wall Street bail out bill?  That would have made me proud.  All their pork was in that  bill!|`|N3S9S1joaa	Why do people keep calling it a stimulus bill?  If any of you bother to look, you'll see it is actually a spending bill driven by the DemocRATS.|`|D6X8xuPFaa	I hate to be the one to inform you of this, but the bill seems to be getting larger since it went to the Senate.    And two bills have recently been passed with bipartisan support:  The S-Chip program was expanded.  The home purchasing tax write off has been increased to $15,000 and it now applies to any home purchase. Not just new home purchases.    Meanwhile the politicians are still pretending to argue about the stimulus plan. And the bill continues to grow.    A keen eye would recognize that Obama is getting what he wants and waiting for the day when he will call the republican bluff and dare them to fillibuster.    Until then, he'll just keep taking what they give him. Because they're giving him what he wants.|`|ewOQX1D1aa	No...but I`m glad they did...Now what are they going to do ???|`|1nt5jpZraa	No. I don't think it needs trimmed. I think the whole bill should get flushed down the toilet. Why does government have to keep getting involved with the free market system? Let companies fail if they make bad choices. I do believe in tax cuts, but they haven't put much of a dent in the bill. When someone tells me to: " hurry up and sign it before its too late", that makes me want to slow down even more and thoroughly investigate.|`|lqVhxD3xaa	Yes - send them a message telling them you don't want this bogus bill.|`|69047ee1b838c1eb9dbce45f9fec72a3aa	No, I don't believe they are standing up for America. I believe they are dragging their feet in an attempt to derail the Democrats plan to bring this nation back to the prosperity we once knew in the 90's.|`|9FI7zaKraa	yes, i wish they would have been trimming the past 8 yrs, Obama wouldnt be president now.|`|TvD9BIGRaa	Their jobs are at stake!|`|xo4iux9gaa	yes, because its not a stumlus bill ...its a SPENDING bill..|`|lHDff8Braa	No. Repubs are only holding out for more of their own failed policies to be included, then they'll vote for it in droves.  Republicans don't care about deficit spending or raising the debt, no matter what they tell you.  Just look at the record of Republican control of Congress from 2000 - 2006, and the Bush Presidency.|`|AA11847612	Filibuster it and kill it. They just need to pretend that they're Democrats and the bill is a fetus. It'll be dead but quick.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Nope.  I think they're hypocrites who, if Obama had been in charge at 9/11 would be yelling for Tax Cuts instead of demanding that we go to Afghanistan.    Remember that it was the Republicans that wanted us to stay out of WWII until Pearl Harbor.|`|Souvww0maa	If only they took this same stance when they were in power ... We would have neither a democrat controlled congress, nor a democrat president.
Oq5a5hRhaa	My cousin did. He went to college right out of high school, flunked out, joined the Navy, served his term and then went back to college for a couple of years. Then, he joined up the National Guard, served his term, and then went to college for a couple more years. Then, he joined the Army, served his term, and went back to college again.    He's thirty-three years old and still hasn't gotten a job better than convience store manager.    Of course, this has more to do with his inability to stay in school than anything else.|`|AA10389562	I did the Navy right out of High School and then went to college after my 6 year enlistment was up.

He is now 34 and an airplane mechanic. He's doing great and makes more money than me (I have a Bachelors degree).    He had no desire (or funds) to go to college.

He says it was a great decision.|`|keEfXfg8aa	my uncle went into the Air Force and he goes to college classes for free.  my other uncle is in the Marines and he is in the Infantry and doesn't care to go to college classes right now but they are always there if he wants to.  my other uncle went into the National Guard and he is currently taking college classes AND has a job.  my other uncle retired from the Marines and he has money for school if he went  (i have to many damn uncles Lol)  and i have a cousin in the Army and one in the Navy and they are taking college classes.  i'm just going to stop there because if i write all of them i'll be writing a novel. my point is it seems to me that anyone that goes into the military will have a fair chance at an education. i think if you have the opportunity to join and actually want too you should.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	Join the Military, my brother did and now they pay for his college, he lucked out and so did my parents now they only have to help me out with my 12 years of college.|`|480393beb0bd8d738e3d33a34301d4faaa	I am going to college while in the military.. Army Reserves or Guard both let you go to college while you are enlisted.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	since I'm from the Vietnam era, it was quite common in my high school class.    And, I'm proud to say, every guy who went came back as a fine person I'd be happy to live next to or work with any time, even the ones I had nothing to do with while in school.|`|fe1FiF0Paa	Tried college at 18 or 19, not my thing.  I spent 23 years in the Navy and let them pay for college and got my degree in 2007 when I finally decided that it was important to me.  It worked out fine, I have a Bachelors in Business Administration and a pretty decent job working in Procurement.|`|wrAhC0IDaa	I did 2 years old college before joining the Army.

oBL3AtRfaa	Pilgrim, you are naughty.   I think we're in for a lot more pain no matter what happens. It's gonna hurt everybody in the budget.|`|Mui28BI5aa	The Obama give away spending plan has a 36 % approval rating of the  American People. This being the case, the mandate this jerk says  he has, is falling apart faster than a cheap suit. People want a results  oriented package, Not some give away wish list, dreamed up by Piglosi  and company. Obama wouldn't know stimulus if it bit him in the ***.    Spending plan is all this is. Piglosi must go. and Reid must follow.  With these two in Place Obama does not have a chance to accomplish  anything, And contrary to YA opinion I really want Obama to succeed  in turning this mess around right now.|`|p9rbEdpdaa	I think electing more Republicans would hurt the most, but it doesn't look like that is about to happen any time soon!|`|JthubNIsaa	What comes next is that this spending plan will not work. More jobs will be lost. More homes lost.|`|AA10264185	Next comes recovery. It can't come fast enough. America wants a stimulus package. The sooner it is passed the sooner we can recover.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	WOw? the Senate stimulates Obama's package???   I think Obama will have an orgasm!

goHKCuyraa	They can't.  in the elite liberal mind no dissent is allowed.    The true liberal thinks they know how to run our lives better than we do and they will not allow any dissenting voices.  Its all about control with liberals.|`|qksvRJIyaa	The real question is why would high ranking politicians even bother to address Rush? And you know the everyday dem listens.

It's like a boil on the seat of our Republic.  The river of hate that comes out of the guy's mouth for the past 20+ years has landed us in the Iraq War.  That's puts him far beyond ignoring.  He is an enemy of the people, and if he wasn't a  suckup buddy of the Bush family he'd be in Federal Prison for his drug crimes.    We might have something for Rush when we reform the FCC later.|`|Gbwiwkauaa	Scared? No..    But it is sad that there are so many people that listen to his garbage instead of thinking and researching for themselves.|`|BHeBSGemaa	Im not scared of him. I don't listen to his show.

AND THAT CAN BECOME A MATTER OF " A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION " !!!!!!!|`|1KHVwyvoaa	Rush is a joke. More people are laughing at him, then with him. Trust me, no one is scare of that man.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	You're obviously not paying attention.  It was the Republicans who are scared of him.  Remember the senator who called Rush Lamelight to apologize to him for a bad Republican comment?  Rush Lameduck is the Republicans equivalent to the DNC; of course you didn't know that either.  Rush Lamebough if the Republicans go-to guy for their problems with the Democrats.  You didn't know that either.|`|IO7fP8o5aa	There's no denying he has an extremely large following of listeners. As such, anything he says will have a large impact in politics one way or another.    I prefer to face reality instead of covering my ears and screaming "lalalalala, Palin was a smart intellectual person who could name a supreme court ruling other then roe v wade, laalalalalalala".|`|shtP63traa	No one's scared of Rush.  He's just a self-important blowhard with a penchant for illegal prescription drugs.    The real worry is the cult-like Dittoheads who actually take him seriously.  *That* is scary.|`|1b835847634639833ab263016ee078fcaa	But, they DO listen.  They must!  I'd bet at least half of his audience is Democrat.    edit:   "Loving...", don't you worry.  I have a mind of my own.  I'm not in any danger of being "brainwashed".  Give me a break.  And I've never listened to Rush.  Why are libs so convinced that our society is just a bunch of mindless drones glued to our radios and televisions?  Oh, wait....|`|YonedWiEaa	because they fear rush will spank them and they might like......Rush makes them wet their pants in public that's why they don't like him.....|`|AA10283080	I'm not scared of him....he's all talk and no action.|`|ohzPenCWaa	Democrat, and I have absolutely no fear of Rush. I fear that his listeners are being brainwashed, but thats not a fear of him, as much as them. Its a shame that Republicans keep talking about Rush could he possibly be the leader of the Republican party right now?|`|gfvh5dwTaa	Liberals/Dems are much like the Nazi parry...they hate anything that will counter their crazy nutcase logic.    Just as Adolph did....they wish to get rid of the opposition|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	He is  1 in talk radio for ratings. Most of the top ten are conservative outlets. Since Rush is at the reigns of the pack, they know the influence he has on voters.    The fairness doctrine is another example of Liberal censorship at its best..|`|f7KKrMJvaa	Because they would never win in an arguement with him.    That's why they mention the prescription drug thing.     They don't know or have anything else.    Conservatism wins everytime.|`|0RvtrkYOaa	People fear the unknown and what they cannot control.  For liberals Rush is an unknown and someone they cannot control, so they attack him in a futile attempt to bash his credibility not knowing that they actually lend credibility to him by their actions.  Rush expects to be attacked by the liberal left, so ina way, they are playing right into his hands.|`|AA11540917	I do not know One single person who is "scared" of limbaugh the drug addict.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	Scared of him!?!?  That's one of the funniest things I heard today.   Dems are not the party of fear.    For the person who mentioned the Fairness Doctrine-no one is pushing for it, and even if they did, it would apply to all who had a broadcasting license.  Since you complain about the liberal media, wouldn't that make it beneficial to conservatives?   Rush makes YOU think it only applies to radio.  Try not to be so gullible.|`|V44ARW4maa	Very few are "scared" of that big mouthed traitor. Most find him disgusting, what with his poking fun at michael j fox's medical condition, and rush's drug addiction, and his latest i-hope-he-fails comment. Yup, as an independent voter, i find if ruskie limplaw is the best (along with joe the plumber and sarah palin) the republicans can offer as leaders, the right is in much deeper trouble than the dems.

2LrQHVb3aa	Absolutely.    Good guy & wyldfyr, you're correct that ACORN is not receiving any money directly from the stimulus package. However, 4.19 billion is being allotted for "neighborhood stabilization activities" such as Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program and Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP). Interestingly enough, ACORN just happens to lobby for both of these groups.    In the past, state & local governments receiving this money on behalf of these organizations would decide how it's used, but the House Dems cleverly added a stipulation that allows non-profit entities to receive money directly from these programs without any middle-man.    So, if you believe that ACORN will not get any of this money, you're either woefully misinformed, refuse to accept the truth, or just plain lying.|`|bYKVKmEKaa	Certainly, Obama has a lot of kick back money to get out, or he is doomed by his own electors.|`|AuQKleIbaa	Absolutely! You hit the nail on the head.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	ACORN faces numerous lawsuits in Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states may need the money to pay for all the lawyers.|`|fLH4ILzbaa	Absolutely, and they are being set up for the next round.|`|VUNfI7yBaa	YES|`|4zijn0cgaa	Yea time to grease all the wheels on that Democratic massive machine and after that might as well get new tires and new paint job and new motor.|`|AA11369432	No, that is not the intent.|`|cbef2b80ad80c5adc11d61992ee6897daa	Absolutely.|`|fh12fkNWaa	No. Do you honestly think the Republicans would allow money to go to ACORN if they personally believed there was fraud beyond a few isolated workers?|`|1amF7oNwaa	YES|`|AA10264185	I wish that you would show me where it is in the proposed stimulus package that gives one cent to ACORN. Search the bill and show me where it is.|`|pM81f5tnaa	Nope.

I wonder how much money is included for MoveOn.org for helping him bypass campaign financing laws, or how much is going to foreign European governments to thank their citizens for donating below the reportable limit so their illegal contributions could never be traced.    I get the feeling the New York Times, MSNBC, and every other corrupt media outlet that openly campaigned for Barack Obama instead of doing their job as professional impartial journalists are also getting a piece of the pie.|`|n5wvy5FYaa	Based on what we've seen and heard so far, it's sad to say it wouldn't be a surprise.|`|V44ARW4maa	wrong    there is no money for acorn, regardless of what fox noise says.|`|gGTk0hkVaa	YEAH...in the immortal words of Elvis ....Thank ya Thank ya Thank ya very much!|`|GkqTIGVqaa	Yes

ICE people will lose their jobs.  6. more tourist income  7. not enough construction being done in time.  8. anti-color race activities increase ( a war between white, black, brown and yellow ), like what happened in Australia.  9. no more restaurants, they are probably all closed  10. find some Americans live in Mexico or Wives live in foreign countries.  11. no more housemaids  12. same ratio of frauds and crime rates    Joel, ...you must be kidding me.

All and all I see the them leaving as a great thing for the economy, and if they want to come back they can apply for citizenship and do it the right way.

gasquENMaa	This is state specific, but here in Ohio, where I live and work, minors from the age of 13 on up can, will and are charged as adults for capital crimes and do go to prison.    I work in a max prison and we have one block that houses 18 and under with 115 currently incarcerated. Charges are usually murder, rape, kidnapping, drive by shootings, attempted murder, etc.     They will stay in this one block until reaching their 18th birthday. At that point, they are considered adults and transferred to general population to continue their sentence.     I hope this helps and you can find it useful

Why are we wasting money to be friends with such a douchey country?|`|LLnNjH94aa	No I do not.  Obama picked a Jewish man to be his Cheif of Staff.  Obama supports Israel, and has labeled Hamas a "terrorist organization."|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Mossad, assassination- I could see that one coming if he didn't uphold the current support in spite of all of the international violations and our seeming need to be represented in the region, essentially by them. Zionists may seem very reasonable and full of impassioned pleas until they don't get what they want.|`|60YMS1xkaa	Obama has already made his stance on Israel clear. He supports her, period.

And there is further reason to worry with his statement to the effect Israelis "have a hard choice to make" with no mention of the Palestinians having to  make a similar choice.  But indeed I think he is already feeling the heat from those statements. Mr Obama has a fine line to walk between the interests of the american people and those of his muslim brothers.

Obama is just one man, and the US political system is very complex that even if Obama wanted to cut aid to Israel (which I have no indication he does), he would not be able to.

Israel and US are like father and children.

Why should blind people be deprived of some good, informative articles?|`|neuprBeGaa	A.  Can't answer this one - perhaps you could specify which Child Pornography law you're talking about.  In any event, it is already illegal to use underage models in pornography - so why do we need an extra law about it?    B.  As someone else noted, Playboy has legitimate non-sexual articles on politics, music, style, and food.  Are you afraid the blind people are just looking at the pictures?    C.  Apparently the "Children's" Internet Protection Act would have prevented ANYONE from accessing any website deemed "obscene" using library computers.  A clear violation of free speech - such filters often restrict legitimate websites dealing with such issues as breast cancer, public policy of homosexuality, and so forth.

(And since they can't actually see the pictures I guess they really are reading it "just for the articles" :P)    c) This restricted access involves using filters. Filters which are notoriously unreliable - stopping people from accesssing valid information websites while at the same time letting through a lot of pure porn sites. I did research about this for an essay and it is censorship, pure and simple. I fully support his position on this issue.    As for abortion without parental consent - our bodies belong to us, not our parents. A teenager shouldn't have to go through a potentially dangerous pregnancy simply because of her parents opinions.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	I get the impression that some people's lives would be a bit empty without something to get righteously outraged about.    Reading prurient material, as the examples you cite, must be important to them, what would they have to stir their emotions without it?    I have an idea that a psychological profiler might be interested, it's a bigger indicator of something unsavoury, than being exposed to pornography at an early, which, unfortunately is almost inevitable on the web.
g7fPDmmxaa	Information about the Delta force is not released at all. The Army will neither confirm, nor deny the existence of the Delta force.

How twisted and arrogant do you have to be to think your message is worthy of airtime in the first place?  They market the idea in the cloak of "Fairness" in the same manner that the progressive tax is "fair".      1.  NPR and PBS would be gone w/o government funding.    2.  Air America failed miserably.    I have an idea -- if the liberal word is in fact demanded, create a show where you can supply that word to enough consumers to require it stay on the air.

Do you have ANY IDEA AT ALL what they mean when they talk about PUBLIC INTEREST OBLIGATIONS of broadcasters?    They're NOT talking about putting on slanted political nonsense.    They ARE talking about ISSUES relating to the local community audience.    LOCAL, not national.    Public interest obligations can include things like having the local mayor on to talk about issues, or a local community service organization, or other LOCAL issue-oriented guests.    I'm sorry, but this OBVIOUSLY comes from some PATHETIC Rush Limbaugh listener who believes he (or she) has found the "aha!" of the "fairness doctrine" NON-ISSUE, has taken something out of context, and decided to run with it.    Radio stations (presumably TV as well) have to maintain a public file in which they keep records of the public interest shows and such they have done in a period of time, whether it's a month or a year.  They have to do that in order to stay current with FCC licensing.    I WORK at a radio station, and the only national politics we deal with on a regular basis is a local guy doing a 1 minute conservative commentary each day.    The asker of this question CLEARLY has ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA about how local media ACTUALLY WORKS.    Regarding the "Diversity in Media ownership"--several media conglomerates are buying up all the small radio stations, so the LOCAL communities are no longer being served.  LOCAL community radio stations are being swallowed up by things like Clear Channel.    Get a clue before asking a RIDICULOUS question like this.      "Rocket34 READ  http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/technol...    I READ it, friend.  You have absolutely NO IDEA what you're talking about, AT ALL.  NOTHING you say is supported by that page.    For everyone answering this question, it's BLATANTLY obvious the only experience they have in media is listening to Rush Limbaugh and flipping TV stations with the clicker.    For the uneducated, here's what those "public interest obligations" may entail...    --having the local police chief on to talk to the public about new speeding restrictions, or clarification on alcohol regulations,     --having the city mayor come on and talk about tax issues  --having the local elementary principal talk about the newest educational program in the school and how the kids are taking to it  --having the local school district Superintendent talk about changes in the school district  --having an organizer of a safety program for elderly people talk about scams that are run against elderly in local neighborhoods.    THAT'S public interest.    Everyone on this board apparently listens only to major market radio and so you're not familiar with these LOCAL issues, and that's EXACTLY the problem that the Whitehouse is seeking to address--they want the public to be aware of LOCAL issues like those I just mentioned.    If you mentioned the "fairness doctrine" to a White House official in connection with this, he'd laugh at you.|`|d9L9C4dHaa	Yes it this Fairness Doctrine is crazy talk that would really mean that leg Chill-in Matthews would have to put a conservative on with him.    But it is really to silence conservative talk radio because the likes of Al Franken and Air America could not even survive with public money because no one was listening to them or very few were listening to them.  Conservative  talk radio survives on it`s own no handouts like Air America got .|`|FIXKYCIGaa	What exactly is wrong with a radio or TV station providing different points of view?  The licenses are granted by the FCC, in other words by the public.  Shouldn't the stations in return have to show that they are working in the public's interest?  They used to have to do that in order to have their license renewed.  The right has been panicked about this for months when there really is no reason for it.  All the station has to do is allot some time for people to respond to comments made on Limbaugh or Hannity or Miller or Schultz or any other political talk show.  They can record responses from people calling into a dedicated number and play the recordings on the air.  If there are numerous people taking issue with the same point brought up by a talk show host the station doesn't have to play all the recordings, just one or two representative calls.  This si the sort of system I grew up watching and it made sense.  I'm sorry that the stations aren't willing to provide alternate points of view on their own, especially when it comes to elections.    This isn't an issue about censorship.  Rush isn't going to be taken off if the air over it.  It's all about money.  The time for responses I described above would marginally reduce the amount of ad time the station has to sell and that's why they have been preemptively fighting it.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Yes, the "revival" of the fairness doctrine is crazy talk.

Discourse is in the public interests, shrill polemics are not.  balance and perspective are in the public interests - one sided agendas are not.    Although I think there is a significant imbalance of rhetoric on a lot of media outlets, I doubt it rises to the level of harming society.  I mean really, did Limbaugh, Coulter, Hannity or O'riley ever actually sway anyone to their side who weren't already there?|`|y7mcYLYPaa	There is nothing fair about the fairness doctrine.    Merriam-Webster defines doctrine:  1archaic : teaching , instruction  2 a: something that is taught b: a principle or position or the body of principles in a branch of knowledge or system of belief : dogma c: a principle of law established through past decisions d: a statement of fundamental government policy especially in international relations e: a military principle or set of strategies    The words "fairness" and "doctrine" is therefore an oxymoron.    The fairness doctrine says that media must provide equal time to opposing arguments.  Sounds fair right?  Look at it this way.  If a group opposes a particular argument, they can just boycott the show.  If they can't broadcast any opposing argument, then they can't legally give their view.  Setting limits and laws on giving ones view is (by definition) limiting free speech.  It doesn't sound so fair now does it?

ZGD72DoKaa	A Department of Homeland Security internal memo discloses seven Border Patrol agents and two supervisors were at the scene of the shooting for which officers Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean are imprisoned.     The previously unpublished report's indication that supervisors were on the scene could explain why Ramos and Compean did not file a report of the Feb. 17, 2005, shooting incident on the Texas border with Mexico, about 40 miles east of El Paso. Moreover, the DHS document says all who were on location, including the supervisors, were "as guilty as those who committed the offense" because of their failure to report misconduct.     The second full paragraph of the DHS memo filed by DHS Special Agent Christopher Sanchez April 12, 2005, states:       Investigation disclosed that the following BP agents were at the location of the shooting incident, assisted in destroying evidence of the shooting, and/or knew/heard about the shooting: Oscar Juarez; Arturo Vasquez; Jose Mendoza; David Jacquez; Lance Medrano; Lorenzo Yrigoyen; Rene Mendez; Robert Arnold; and Jonathan Richards.  Of the nine listed agents, two were supervisors, Arnold and Richards. Arnold was a supervisory Border Patrol agent and Richards was a field operations supervisor, the senior BP officer on the field that day. Three of the agents, Vasquez, Jacquez and Juarez, were given immunity by Sutton's office. All three were called as witnesses by the prosecution to testify against Ramos and Compean at trial.     In a Jan. 19 exclusive interview with WND, Sutton maintained throwing away the shell casings and not filing reports were central to the reason he decided to prosecute Ramos and Compean.     While he repeated the accusation many times in the interview, here is how Sutton phrased why he thought the two officers were guilty:       What these two agents did is that they shot 15 times at an unarmed, fleeing man. And instead of doing what every other agent does, namely to explain why they decided to use deadly force, these two agents instead decided to lie about it, cover it up, destroy the evidence, pick up all the shell casings and throw them away where we couldn't find them, destroy the crime scene and then file a false report.   Yet, the DHS memo further specifies that all the mentioned agents were considered equally culpable in not reporting the shooting or in picking up the expended shells.       Investigation disclosed that none of the above agents, to include Compean and Ramos, reported the shooting or the subsequent cover up when Compean and Vasquez picked up expended brass cartridges (i.e., evidence of the shooting) and threw them away.   The DHS memo also references an Aug. 3, 2004, memo from Border Patrol Chief Luis Barker sent to all agents in the El Paso sector. The memo advises that the penalty for failing to report allegations of misconduct is disciplinary action, not criminal charges and prosecution.     DHS Special Agent Christopher Sanchez wrote:       The memorandum advised that BP employees must immediately report an allegation of misconduct and that they are subject to disciplinary action for failing to report allegations of misconduct.   The highlighted parts of this memo were printed in bold type in the original. Sanchez also documented that Compean and Ramos were among those who signed that they had read and understood the memo regarding reporting allegations of misconduct.     Andy Ramirez, who has closely followed the case as chairman of the group Friends of the Border Patrol, asks why only Ramos and Compean were prosecuted.     "All the listed agents were in the field, and the memo says they knew about the shooting, including the two supervisors," Ramirez told WND. "The Border Patrol manual specifies that only a verbal report needs to be made of shooting incidents like this. All the agents in the field that day were discussing the shooting incident, including the supervisors. What more of a verbal report needed to be made? Ramos and Compean weren't trying to hide anything, not with the field supervisors right there."     Ramirez charged that Sutton gave immunity in exchange for favorable testimony.     "Arturo Vasquez, David Jacquez and Oscar Juarez were given immunity because they were willing to tell the story to the jury that Sutton needed told," Ramirez insisted. "They all lied. Juarez even contradicted himself on the stand, changing his lies as he went along."     Why were none of the other agents charged with crimes," Ramirez continued," when the DHS memo clearly states that   in destroying evidence of the shooting?"     Ramirez said Sutton "decided to go after Ramos and Compean because they were the only two who fired their weapons."     "Then Sutton twisted the story to make it sound like Ramos and Compean were the only ones who picked up the casings," he said. "Sutton also tells the story as if Ramos and Compean were the only two on the scene; he always omits to mention that the DHS investigation clearly found all these agents and supervisors were there and knew about the shooting."     Why did Ramos and Compean pick up their expended shells?     "Sutton maintained that Ramos fired only once and hit the fleeing drug smuggler, but he doesn't accuse Ramos of picking up his shell," Ramirez clarified. "Sutton says Compean fired 14 times and that he picked up all the shells. Compean picked up the shells in disgust. He was frustrated the drug smuggler got away. What Sutton doesn't tell you is that Compean just threw the shells right back on the ground. He never put them in his pocket or carried them off the field."     Did Compean really fire 14 times without hitting the drug dealer, Aldrete-Davila?     "Truthfully, nobody knows how many times Compean fired," Ramirez told WND.

He had blood coming out of his ears.  He was kicked with steal toed boots.

Ignacio Ramos is  convicted for pursuing an illegal immigrant and drug smuggler on the United StatesMexico border and attempting to cover up the evidence. He and his partner fired fifteen shots at an unarmed man in broad daylight and failed to report it to anyone instead giving a false report and leaving their victim for dead after removing their shell casings from the scene of their crime. President George W. Bush agreed to review the case, and Representative Duncan Hunter introduced a bill, entitled the Ramos and Compean Act, that would pardon the two agents.     Who gives Ramos the right to shoot a man in the back 15 times, hide the evidence and not be punished/? Now I am not saying what they did to him in prison is acceptable, of course not, they too need to be punished for beating this man.

Operation Downfall      Operation Downfall was the overall Allied plan for the invasion of Japan near the end of World War II. The operation was cancelled when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan.    Operation Downfall consisted of two parts  Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island of Kysh, with the recently captured island of Okinawa to be used as a staging area.    Later, in the spring of 1946, Operation Coronet was the planned invasion of the Kant plain near Tokyo on the Japanese island of Honsh. Airbases on Kysh captured in Operation Olympic would allow land-based air support for Operation Coronet.    Japan's geography made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese as well; they were able to accurately predict the Allied invasion plans and adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsug, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kysh, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations.    Casualty predictions varied widely but were extremely high for both sides: depending on the degree to which Japanese civilians resisted the invasion, estimates ran into the millions for Allied casualties,and tens of millions for Japanese casualties.    In a study done by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April, the figures of 7.45 casualties/1,000 man-days and 1.78 fatalities/1,000 man-days were developed. This implied that a 90-day Olympic campaign would cost 456,000 casualties, including 109,000 dead or missing. If Coronet took another 90 days, the combined cost would be 1,200,000 casualties, with 267,000 fatalities.  A study done by Adm. Nimitz's staff in May estimated 49,000 casualties in the first 30 days, including 5,000 at sea. A study done by General MacArthur's staff in June estimated 23,000 in the first 30 days and 125,000 after 120 days. When these figures were questioned by General Marshall, MacArthur submitted a revised estimate of 105,000, in part by deducting wounded men able to return to duty.  In a conference with President Truman on June 18, Marshall, taking the Battle of Luzon as the best model for Olympic, thought the Americans would suffer 31,000 casualties in the first 30 days (and ultimately 20% of Japanese casualties, which implied a total of 70,000 casualties). Adm. Leahy, more impressed by the Battle of Okinawa, thought the American forces would suffer a 35% casualty rate (implying an ultimate toll of 268,000). Admiral King thought that casualties in the first 30 days would fall between Luzon and Okinawa, i.e., between 31,000 and 41,000.  Of these estimates, only Nimitz's included losses of the forces at sea, though kamikazes had inflicted 1.78 fatalities per kamikaze pilot in the Battle of Okinawa, and troop transports off Kysh would have been much more exposed.    A study done for Secretary of War Henry Stimson's staff by William Shockley estimated that conquering Japan would cost 1.7 to 4 million American casualties, including 400,000 to 800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities. The key assumption was large-scale participation by civilians in the defense of Japan.    Outside the government, well-informed civilians were also making guesses. Kyle Palmer, war correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, said half a million to a million Americans would die by the end of the war. Herbert Hoover, in memorandums submitted to Truman and Stimson, also estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 fatalities, and were believed to be conservative estimates; but it is not known if Hoover discussed these specific figures in his meetings with Truman. The chief of the Army Operations division thought them "entirely too high" under "our present plan of campaign."    For context, the Battle of Normandy had cost 63,000 casualties in the first 48 days; and the Battle of Okinawa ran up 72,000 casualties over about 82 days, of whom 18,900 were killed or missing. Several thousand soldiers who died indirectly whether from wounds or other causes at a later date are not included. The entire war cost the United States a total of just over a million casualties, with 400,000 fatalities.    Nearly 500,000 Purple Heart medals were manufactured in anticipation of the casualties resulting from the invasion of Japan. To the present date, all the American military casualties of the sixty years following the end of World War II  including the Korean and Vietnam Wars  have not exceeded that number. In 2003, there were still 120,000 of these Purple Heart medals in stock. There are so many in surplus that combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan are able to keep Purple Hearts on-hand for immediate award to wounded soldiers on the field.

They decided they were more like phones, so they were protected too... we learned this in my Constitution class last night..|`|Souvww0maa	Any time congress makes a law that prevents freedom of speech, they are violating our constitutional rights.    Congress has no problem with TV and Print media, since they are dominated by the left.  If it were not for NPR (A tax payer funded radio network), the Left would have no presence in radio.    What roils the left about talk radio is that they their ideas cannot compete with conservative ideas.  There is no audience.  Sponsors will not spend money to advertise on a liberal talk show.  There is very little money in it.  Hell, the only reason Air America lasted as long as it did is because leftist investors bought entire blocks of air time for the broadcasts.  They lost money every day they broadcast.    Government as a whole dislikes talk radio because an informed public is a difficult populace to rule.  Talk radio lets people know what is going on in government.  If it were not for talk radio, the ridiculous McCain/Kennedy Immigration Amnesty bill would have passed.  The government doesn't like for us to know what they are up to.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Radio is covered by the 1st amendment, so is TV and all "public airwaves"    IF we have free speech, why can't they cuss or show boobs on broadcast TV?  Why can't they cuss on the Radio?    What about that free speech?|`|zeaoUpaQaa	"radio is not necessarily covered by the 1st Amendment (according to the left)"    Who told you that?|`|D6kwriPxaa	I love the answer "The left only wants what's best for them."    Like the right doesn't what's best for them?    The reality is simple.  The Dems won and they can make the rules now.  If you don't like them, then you can change things in the next election.      But this holier than thou krap just makes you look like a loser.
VSmQWuhEaa	Um communism failed because the government became far more oppressive and intolerant of basic freedoms, earning the ire of a ruled people. And due to the inefficiency of bureaucracy the government control of the means of production led to a standard of living for the average person that was virtually non existent.     So why didn't it survive and move into American society.  A. Americans like to be free.  B. Americans like to eat, stay warm, and have clothes.|`|qt9rrk6xaa	This is a good question.    The ideas did spread here in the 1930's and lead to the birth of labor movement. That movement flourished until the late 1960's. After that, there's been a steady decline coincident with the rise of globalization.     So capital, like water, seeks its lowest level. Thus, outsourcing etc. We are now in the nadir of that movement. Sooner or later the pendulum will swing internationally as those who produce the wealth of a nation demand more of its share. The standard of living here is higher for a factory worker than it is in India or China. Sooner or later that will even out. I don't know if it will take 20, or 50 years, but it's going to happen. Then there will be a global unionization movement. You simply cannot have a global economy without global costs of labor. We're in the process of switching over.|`|GkShK7JZaa	True and pure socialism has never worked anywhere it has been tried.  Why would it be popular at all?
AA11847612	Or when the media is in the tank for the current administration.    The answer is the internet. Do your research. Find sources that you trust (proven correct over a long period). Read foreign media sources. Even if it is wrong or slanted, it is always helpful to see how other cultures view yours and reflect on why that it.    In other words read, read, read (television is the tool of the MAN and not to be trusted). The more you know of current events and (just as important) world history, the better off you are.|`|s9WG4NaPaa	well is not against any laws to use your own brain  nobody will put in prison by doing that...

Or, do what I do, if the source is either a government or mega-corporation study or mouthpiece, believe the opposite, or multiply by 1000.    Take unemployment, the government knows that 20-30% of our citizens were self employed, they don't count in unemployment even if they cannot feed themselves.    Take the current disaster and multiply by at least 100, probably 1000 and you will start to become aware of the magnitude of the hurt we are in.    Buy food and survival supplies.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	If all you want to do is find and agree with someone who agrees with you, then there is plenty on the web for anyone from far left to far right.  If the government is screening this, then they are doing a terrible job and you shouldn't find it a problem.  If its just that you think that the media is either in the bag for one side or another, at the governments behest, then they are doing a lousy job at that too.  My guess is that you just don't like or agree with whats out there.

No one is completely free of this tendancy.|`|9yuLiTE6aa	The liberals are currently in charge.  Yes, we get brainwashed.  That's what political correctness is all about.

So is every other poor sop out there. What is the REAL truth? We are all just guessing hence the broad spectrum of opinions on every issue under the sun.|`|bYKVKmEKaa	More than half of America has been brainwashed under the espouses of "CHANGE".  This has happened during WWII under Hitler.  People were looking for change and a new, and better way of life, and became blinded by the truth.  They fall for grandiose ideas, and by a government that will take care of everything.  It eventually becomes a dictatorship.  In the end reality takes place, and by then it is usually to late for "CHANGE".  The damage is done!  People must think for themselves, and not rely on the goverment.  Big government is always bad for freedom.  There will be a cost for socialism under Obama, and that cost is what our soldiers have died for from every war "FREEDOM".  I hope and pray America will find it's way back to "In God We Trust".  We seem to be drifting too far away from this simple motto that our country is defined by.  Is this "CHANGE"?|`|OGcUE4zeaa	This is yet another great question floating around out there.    I think most of us in some way or another is being so called brain washed.  YOu really have to stop and look at whats going on around you and decide is this RIGHT or WRONG.   Once you start to do this, you need to bring things down to the most simplest of levels, or most simplest of questions.    WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG?  I believe there should be just one basic thing.  A person has the right to LIFE LIBERTY AND THERE PROPERTY!    This means they have the right to live how they want to ... HOWEVER... whatever.... as long as it doesn't run into someone Else's LIFE.    LIBERTY....Your right to life means no one can hurt you or take your life.  Your right to liberty means no one can restrict your actions/thoughts as long as you are not transgressing against another life/liberty or property.  So as long as you are on your property or common land (government land) and are not hurting anyone, no one can restrict what you do  Property... no one has the right to take whats yours.....    NOTHING NOTHING SHOULD GO AGAINST THIS!  so in all things I ask myself this.  Does it go against someones life ... someones liberty ... or someones property....    I am struggling right now because.... The government is Robbing from the american people, taking there life's free choices away, and we are giving them the power to take any rights from when they see fit.      In terms of religion.  People have the right to believe whatever they want to.  As long as it goes with the above I have no problems.  meaning if its your religion to go kill people now that would be wrong and should be stopped but if its your religion to walk down the street in all pink with a joint in hand and a gun on your shoulder.  I am fine with it.  Just don't shoot anyone cause that would cause a problem.      People get brain washed when someone convinces them that someone else know better than they do how to take care of there own.|`|AA11847612	The indoctrination starts from day 1.

I am aware of the constant stream of propaganda issuing forth from the Government like the outflow from a sewage pipe.  Regimes that seek to impose beliefs on their populations against their will must realise that coercion only produces a situation in which everyone becomes a hypocrite.

AA10999111	We already HAVE lost our freedom of speech! Look at how the BNP are not permitted to canvas support for their party. Why not? An open debate is necessary and the mark of a free society.    I was horrified, but not the least bit surprised, about Carol Thatcher getting the sack. The poor woman was making an utterly harmless and non-vindictive observation in a private conversation and yet she was still sacked over it. The BBC should be ashamed of itself and hats off to Carol for refusing to apologise.|`|JMaBPt7Iaa	yes the bbc acted like big brother|`|PZZkjST7aa	It was not a private remark, she made it in her workplace, and the BBC was right to take action following complaints of using a racially offensive term.  It would have been a private remark if she had made it to a friend outside work.|`|doLyOac0aa	You go and have a meeting with 12 people, who you don't really know, and you say the coloured guy at your meeting looks like a G,  You would not say that, eh?    Why stand up for upper class twits like CT?  and it says it all that she would not apologies, she did not think she had done anything wrong,|`|AA12349988	If 12 relative strangers to Carol Thacther heard the comment it is hardly private.    Why not put the theory that this was OTT to the test tomorrow - ask 12 of your work colleagues to a meeting in the staff canteen tomorrow at lunch and make comments about someone looking like a Golliwog and see what your employer does.    Additionally Carol Thatcher was not an employee of the BBC she was a paid guest and following her comments and subsequent failure to issue an apology the BBC has decided not to use her again.    Edit     Eric as someone who is half Irish I do take offence at those old jokes there was an English Scot and poor thick paddy.  They are saying that I am not as clever as someone who is English or Scottish.   Or not as good at my job and therefore should be passed for promotion or not paid as much - if I allow those 'jokes' in the work place guess what eventually people start to believe them and I am passed over for promotion.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	The way I see it, I'm a big boy now and I don't cry every time somebody says something to me I don't like.  I just shrug and think about something more important.  Some people are far too sensitive, and the trouble is this tiny minority are dictating to everyone else.  Chances are everything we say is bound to offend someone somewhere IF people work themselves up into becoming too sensitive.

There is too much PC these days but people shouldn't make offensive remarks anyway. The BBC is of course totally biased because Ross deserved the sack but didn't get it and Clarkson should get the push over his remarks about Brown being 'a one eyed Scottish idiot' The reason for Clarkson to get pushed are that the remark is racist and derogatory to a disabled person.   See how easy it is to be PC ?|`|CP5RZaFnaa	Yes I am of the opinion that we do need more freedom to attack people and offend them. I mean its a good idea to get on each others bad books. So let us go and tell the Jews we love Hitler, tell the Blacks we love the good old days of slavery, tell the Muslims we love gay sex, tell the Christians there is no White god and so on. Now would that make you and others happier. I doubt it, what we need is black people to be less rude and ignorant and white people to stop blaming everything on minorities. I mean every single country in the world has a minority population.

Not only do you deploy, but you also go away for temporary mission assignments and schooling.|`|wo4xNVhRaa	Ive been in the Army for over ten years and I've served with all of the other branches in one way or another. And I can honestly say, without and apprehension whatsoever, that the Air Force has it the easiest. If you did get deployed, you would be so far from danger its ridiculous. I just came home from Afghanistan, the most dangerous place in the world right now, and every AF person I saw was on a huge base with all the amenities of the US. The only difference is that you have to carry a weapon around. So you would have heat and AC, good food, a roof over your head, most likely your own private space, and even Burger King or Pizza Hut. So don't sweat a deployment. The family separation isn't that big of a deal. The internet connections are actually pretty good. You could actually bring a lap top and plug in right in your own room and web cam with your family. Even make a naughty movie for your Hubby. (If you wanted to or are into that).

But ultimately, it is up to the sentencing court.|`|1bYITsABaa	Sometimes you can get off probation early, if you complete the community service (without a lot of hassles- like being late, giving them a hard time)   and paying the fine off.

Please clarify your question    When will the EU unite - it will be a slow process over the next 25 years.    Why will it unite?  - Because individually the nations will lose more influence on the world stage as developing countries overtake the independent nations  -  to remain a global player it will have no choice.

The world economy or Global Economy to give it a grander name was held together by glue and sticky tape, that glue was cheap easy credit, and the sticky tape was cheap easy labour.  And one without the other cannot exist, all this talk of a Global Economy where national borders don't exist is utter nonsense, it just doesn't make any sense, any country and its people that fails to act on this will suffer the consequences of higher unemployment, higher tax and a steep decline in their standard of living.    Even now there are countries around the world that are considering protectionist's policies to safeguard their economies to help reduce unemployment and poverty.  Any government democratic or not that fails to do this risks civil unrest.  amongst its population    Free and fair trade is one thing, but the movement of people by multinational companies is another and will be resisted by people in a time of recession/depression.    No two, three, four or more countries are alike they will each have differing strenght's and weakness's, but to treat each as one is both foolish and doomed to failure for one or more or for all concerned.    Human nature and its emotions, where the need to survive and protects ones own, can be far more powerful than people give it credit and when emotions take control, logic and clear thinking can often get left and forgotten at the back of the bus.    To deny this is, to deny human nature.|`|rWyPIPQLaa	1]no  2]only if russia comes onboard as with nato  3]never  4]war with iran/china  5]some pratt   6]nuclear desolation  result cheap beer and cigs all the rest crap
DTSUJe2oaa	The age of majority is the age when young people are considered adults. Colorado, as many other states, has determined the age of majority to be 18 years of age or older. Individuals are treated as adults in every aspect, with some exceptions, such as drinking alcoholic beverages (12-47-901), renting cars, and purchasing a hotel room. When an individual reaches the age of majority his or her parents are no longer liable for their child's actions. Some acts young people who have reached the age of majority may be involved in are:   entering into any legal binding contract (13-22-101(a))   managing estate (13-22-101(b))   to sue or be sued to the full extent (13-22-101(c))   making decisions regarding his or her own body (13-22-101(d))   voting in elections (Const. US., amendment XXVI)   arbitrating a claim (13-22-202)   consenting to medical treatment (13-22-102)   joining the military without guardian permission   Even though the age of majority allows young people greater rights, many young people at age 18 still live at home and are thus subject to parents rules while at home.  Although these are the colorado laws you would be hard pressed to find a law enforcement agency that would pursue a person 1 month from legal age of majority.~|`|usltkMnwaa	I don't know the statutes of Colorado, but from personal advice, I would think your parents would let it go. I mean, pulling you back into the home for a single month would just be single for them, and if they did so, you could make life so hell for them that they would just ask you to leave.     If you have your parents approval, yes you can. Many people go to college while they are still 17. Actually, i think you can drop out of high school at 16 in colorado as well as date someone 9 yrs older than you in colorado. I would assume you can move out at 17 as well, even against your parents'
Ot6MQxtjaa	A 2007 study by the Canadian government found cannabis smoke contained more toxic substances than tobacco smoke. The study determined that marijuana smoke contained 20 times more ammonia, and five times more hydrogen cyanide and nitrogen oxides than tobacco smoke. In spite of this, recent studies have been unable to demonstrate a direct link between lung cancer and frequent direct inhalation of marijuana smoke. While many researchers have failed to find a correlation, some researchers still conclude that marijuana smoke poses a higher risk of lung cancer than tobacco. Some studies have even shown that the non-psychoactive ingredient CBD found in marijuana may be useful in treating breast cancer.    Cannabis use has been assessed by several studies to be correlated with the development of anxiety, psychosis and depression, however, no causal mechanism has been proven, and the meaning of the correlation and its direction is a subject of debate that has not been resolved in the scientific community. Some studies assess that the causality is more likely to involve a path from cannabis use to psychotic symptoms rather than a path from psychotic symptoms to cannabis use, while others assess the opposite direction of the causality, or hold cannabis to only form parts of a "causal constellation", while not inflicting mental health problems that would not have occurred in the absence of the cannabis use.    Studies have also shown links between heavy long-term use (over five joints daily over several years) and incidence of heart attacks, strokes, as well as abnormalities in the amygdala and hippocampus regions of the brain.|`|AA12302228	the great late,bob marley|`|HeoS75kGaa	Everything is bad for you.

For countries that use a system like the USA (called presidential democracy), then the executive branch is headed by a president.

AA12302228	he would at least be jailed for perjury and his *** sued out of sight|`|AA11622716	depends.  In general, if he never went to trial he was never in jeopardy for the murder charge.  Separate from that, however, he can enforce the plea bargain.  That is why the plea bargain probably required him to testify "truthfully" in order to get the deal.  If the person breached the bargain by testifying falsely, then he cannot enforce the deal and the prosecutor can bring all possible charges.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	Since he never had a trial that began then jeopardy has not attached to the plea bargainer. The jury must be seated I think is precisely when that happens, not before.    Recanting testimony will not be enough for a successful appeal. Appeals must be based on errors as the law was applied in the trial, not new or changed evidence.    Finally, any leniency as a result of a plea bargain depends on him upholding his part of the bargain. If he doesn't do that (as happens occasionally) then the deal is canceled, and he is back where he started|`|VOccyg7daa	He wasn't charged with murder so he could now be charged with it.|`|usltkMnwaa	They would bring charges of Murder against him, and with his confession, he would go to prison quick and probably get the maximum  penalty because the judge would be pissed off.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Usually, that type of plea agreement contains a provision that the testimony given in exchange for the deal must be accurate and truthful.  If it turns out that he perjured himself, the deal is off and the original charges can be reinstated.|`|JQwL50JMaa	You can't charge a person twice for the same crime.  It would be considered double jeopardy then.  You can, however,  charge someone with something like conspiracy or another crime connected to the original murder case, if you have evidence to support it, and it would NOT be considered double jeopardy.    Thumbs down, SERIOUSLY?  If you are let go on murder charges, they cannot charge you with murder again.  It would be considered double jeopardy.  But I have seen many cases in which people are charged with conspiracy, assault, or something else in order to get a conviction.
IJTcGIG7aa	Listen.....don't try to apply common sense to Republican logic now, or things will get messy.    Lets ignore the fact that we've had our biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression during a time of the Bush tax cuts.   Lets ignore the fact that Bush doubled the size of the national debt, with record deficits during his term, during GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES.    Obama's President, and Republicans actually hold him to a higher standard....competence....one they would have never thought to apply to Bush.     They want Obama to pass a balanced budget in a massive recession.......what got us into the Depression.    Republicans are playing Herbert Hoover all over again.|`|bTguVXMjaa	You won't get any proof, because tax cuts do not automatically help the overall economy. As with most tax measures, some people benefit while others suffer -  under Reagan and both Bushes. for example, the poor, the elderly, and the infirm did terrible, while the rich did quite well. Moreover, the American economy is too large and complex to respond predictably to any single influence. That's why Obama wants to "shotgun" it with his stimulus package, which is scattered over a number of different approaches.|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	I think that's about the time the Dems took over congress.

DTSUJe2oaa	Attorney's fees are handled differently in SSD and SSI claims. If you are deemed eligible for SSD, the Social Security Administration will withhold 25% of your past due benefits to pay your attorney's fees and will send the check directly to us. If you receive SSI, however, you must send us a personal check or money order for 25% of the past due benefits that you are awarded. If you receive both SSD and SSI benefits, your attorney's fee will be 25% of the combined past due SSD and SSI benefits.  You must send a personal check or money order for the costs paid by the firm in both SSD and SSI cases.~|`|Gezfmghuaa	Most SSI lawyers I know of don't work on contingency, they want the money up front.

So America somehow intercepted the note (some beleive the british made the note up and gave it to us to be pissed at germany and declare war it is unknown.) and got pretty pissed off, and prior to the note the germans were using unrestricted submarine warfare to take down civilian ships or supply ships to the allies so america finally declared war to end all of the confusion of the war and since america wasn't tired like the rest of the countries fighting we helped quickly end the war.|`|YuT5v5aoaa	The U.S. decided to enter WW1 when British spies intercepted a telegram (Zimmerman telegram) from the German Government to the German ambassador in Mexico .

Prior to the telegram, Germany's U-Boats torpedoed unarmed vessels (most famous was the torpedoing of the Lusitania, a British passenger ship) despite the warnings given by President Wilson. Once information was uncovered about the Zimmerman Telegram, President Wilson went to congress for a declaration of war.

He took the watch as part of an agreement to be repaired, him bringing it to a pawn shop and then returning later is basically breaking the agreement (contract).

I'm sorry that the "pocket" phrase came across as insensitive. I didn't mean that anyone was trying to benefit from his death. I simply meant that the death benefit has a purpose: to pay for his funeral.

Your insurance is going to go way up if you don't get it reduced, so do this ASAP.|`|71cee0a988c5dc1c7d401b674d0e14dbaa	where did you get gas money?|`|8T6PwLpxaa	Go to court and explain this to the judge.|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	It might be different in your state (I live in California), but YES, you can get an extension.  I got a speeding ticket one time, and when I went to the court clerk's office to pay it, they said I could get an extension.  In fact, I think I was able to extend it twice.  So I ended up having like 3 or 4 months to pay it.    Don't contest it.  You probably don't even need to go to court.  Just go to the city or county clerk's office and ask for an extension.  You might even be able to work out some kind of payment plan, or they should at least give you a one time extension.

HOdisPCWaa	Go for it lad, junior entrants always do well when they get into the regiment or Corp waiting until you are 18 is folly because there's a lot to learn and a lot can be learnt prior to going into recruit training.  Im ex Rifles section commander and I trained junior soldiers and they stand out a mile from those who join at 18. Many do far better on the promotion ladder far better then those who join at 18 you have good head start.  Your mates may say you are nuts but that's because they have no idea and no bottle.

(Granted it's been 7 years since I went to basic)   Most of the stuff you'll need will be issued to you, they will also give you a small pay advance to get anything you may need in addition to that (toothpaste, soap, running shoes, etc). You may wish to bring pictures of family, a bible (religious books are the only books authorized), 1 or 2 sets of civilian cloths should be ok (they will probably be locked up until you finish).

As a Rifleman you are joining a regiment that all others followed they were all in their red coats whilst we were in Rifle Green with Rifles and not musket's we were using fire and movement whilst they were forming line or square. But they are catching up.  Good luck and watch out for a crazy Major he is my brother in law.
BImIMnbzaa	This number depends on your job duties and the type unit you're attached to.  A Recon Marine would run five miles every morning before chow call.   I, having been in motor transport, did most of my running at the mouth.    Not all Marine duties pertain to extreme physical fitness, but the specials ops, and combat ready are required to keep a regular regimen.

The Marine Corps PFT (Physical Fitness Test) is a 3 mile run, so all Marines run that, once a year, at a minnimum.    In the infantry, while we were in garrison, we had 2 hours of PT every morning and the shortest we ever ran was 5 miles, the longest being close to 17 when we would go to the ocean and back from our camp. Keep in mind, that even on the shorter runs, we would sometimes do them wearing gas masks, or with our assault packs, etc, just to make them a bit harder.    If your senior Marines (Team Leaders and Squad Leaders) hate you though - you'll run a lot more :D.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	I am not a Marine, but I have studied Military workouts to get ideas for fitness routines. Here is an idea of the kind of stuff they do.      "the daily dozen".   Starting with several stretches followed by  (side-startle hops, bends & thrusts, rowing exercise, side benders, leg lifts, toe touches, mountain climbing, trunk twisters, push-ups, bend and reach, body twists, and squat benders), up to 15 reps each, and up to three sets of each    3 to 5 miles runs, but mostly 5 miles    obstacle courses, circuit courses, or 3-, 5- or 10-mile conditioning marches.     martial-arts training, close combat training, bayonet training    Of course a lot of time spent drilling with your rifle in your hands.    This is just an idea. They do other things as well, but yeah, it's very physical|`|Z1xylSJNaa	when i was in the usmc, it was 5 a day (except on saturday :))    god bless america
AA11494150	Miranda is only required when both of the following exist:  1. You are in police custody and not free to leave, and  2. You are being questioned about the crime you are in custody for.    A traffic stop is considered a "temporary detention", and not an arrest, so Miranda is not required until you are actually placed under arrest.    Most importantly, Miranda is a rule of evidence only. This means if there is a Miranda violation, it does not mean charges automatically get dropped. It just means any questions you answered can not be used against you in court.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Of course you can still be charged with it.  Miranda is not required until you are under custodial interrogation.|`|orfmhb2waa	the cops can do whatever they want to you , you are screwed, and stop smoking weed and try to make something out of yourself.|`|TOq7shCIaa	I couldnt have answered it any better than trooper3316 did. Perfect answer.|`|AA11458923	If they asked you any questions before reading you your rights the answers to those questions could get thrown out. However if they asked you those questions at the scene of the crime before you were a suspect they can and will be used against you in a court of law.|`|20548066dc47ae7119f326e7867c0c83aa	He should have read you your rights at the time of arrest and anything you said could not be used against you in court. When he did read you your rights at the station, from that point on any admissions are admissible in court. That being said the evidence at the scene of the arrest is admissible and you and your friends can be charged. The Miranda warning is just informing you of your rights against self incrimination and that you do have the right to have an attorney there to represent you.The Mirada and Escabedo cases that spawned these warnings were all about informing a suspect in a crime of his constitutional rights.

Anyway, personally my feeling is that celebrities have a right to say what they think as anyone else would, but is it smart for them to do it? I don't think so.     Already I've been pissed off at some musicians I used to like based on their recent Bush trashing and Obama support, so whatever, that's fine, but they've lost a fan in me, I'm no longer going to buy their music and that's that.    Okay, whatever, it's not about being "open minded" it's a question of whether you are giving support to a person who is a socialist. and if you're really a republican as you claim to be, you would be giving him no support at all because to give him support would mean you are supporting a person who does NOT agree with your vision of the way the country should be, got it? Giving him support is like poison if you don't agree with him. It's like you're being an enabler of sorts, and that's not a good thing.

vwYbFtkqaa	Having lived with socialized medicine for 17 years I can state that Pilgrim "knows not of what he speaks".  He fails to mention the thousands of insured Americans who go to Canada to buy prescription medications that are unaffordable for them in the US.    Our poor standing in health and mortality statistics should be enough to get our government out of the grip of the US medical industry and into single payer or Universal Health Care in this country.|`|KJKQih1Paa	Canadians have to wait for healthcare because they have a shortage of physicians, not because they have universal healthcare. What we have now is not fair and does serve the american people. While universal single payer healthcare is not perfect, our system is even less so.  The health insurance industry is a multibillion dollar industry that employs a lot of people in this country, so we would have to deal with that issue somehow if we ever did reform our healthcare. There is an ethical issue here: Is health, or the lack thereof, something we should be making profits from?  I don't think so. I don't think the profits from illness system we have now is good, and I think single payer might be a little bit better.|`|6eELSo1raa	There are too many third world people coming to the U.K. that the Nationel Health Service in the U.K. is crumbling.

What a radical concept.|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	Let's just correct one of your sentences to reflect REALITY in the countries you cite and to correct what Michael Moore didn't want you to know when he fabricated his fictional presentation:    Your sentence:  "In other countries, if you need a certain medicine/procedure, you get it done and you don't have to pay for it. But why cant we do that here?"    Reality:  "after waiting a very long time to see a primary care physician, you may be referred to a specialist depending on your age and whether the government authorizes treatment of your disease for people of your age.  You are given an appointment many months in the future which is upsetting since they think that you might have [cancer or other disease but you are in pain.]  That doctor may or may not schedule you for surgery or other treatment in a government-run facility.  He will make an appointment for you and you will be given that appointment at a future date.   Of course when you are finally treated, if you aren't dead by then, the government pays for it."  This system is very cost efficient.  Guess why?    Did you hear about the case in Oregon, under their State health plan? A man was denied medicine for his cancer treatment that might have prolonged his life because the State decided he was terminal.  (Isn't everybody?)  Rather than send him medicine, they sent him $50 worth of drugs to help him end his life under the State's assisted suicide law.    People in other countries might also live longer because they eat better, take better care of themselves, have better family structure, and other factors.  They do not have horrendous rates of self-induced obesity and diabetes.  The death rates for low birth weight babes born to extremely young unwed mothers, murder victims, substance abusers, etc are factored into the "life expectancy" rates in the US.  This is NOT about medical care.  It is about lifestyles that have nothing to do with the medical care people do or do not receive.    No one is "denied" healthcare.  It is illegal for a medical facilty to turn anyone away.  People may not be "covered" by an insurance policy but they are covered by Medicaid if they are poor, so that 50 million number is BOGUS.  Many included in that number also refuse coverage that it available to them because they are irresponsible.    Foreigners who can afford it flock to the US for the best medical care in the world.  I have lived overseas and, believe me, when you're sick, the first thing you do is figure out how to get back to the US.|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	Yes it would.    FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.      FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.    That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.|`|2d66454da71ea52f9302b902d6991747aa	It doesn't work anywhere else, why would it work here?    You think it works in the UK?  What have you been smoking?  In the UK, they don't allow dialysis for people over 55.  Just go home and die please . . . NEXT.    Why do Canadians cross the border for health care?  Because the waiting period can be YEARS!      I was an insurance adjuster, and I know all about the abuses and litigation that's causing our medical costs to be sky high, but would you rather have incompetent doctors who know they can't get sued?    Our system isn't perfect, but it's heaven compared to the hell in countries with state sponsored health care.    The solution is mandatory medical savings accounts.  It levels the playing field, puts control of health costs into the hands of the patient, keeps government out of the equation and can be set up so that everybody has access to medical treatment.  It worked extremely well in Venezuela until nut-ball took over the country.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	No it wouldn't.|`|V44ARW4maa	i agree with you, which means i disagree with pilgrim. Yes, it works in other countries and there is no legitimate reason it cannot work here.|`|ejluOCdTaa	No..|`|2LrQHVb3aa	Most likely not.    Doesn't effectively work anywhere else, why should it work here?    You're WOEFULLY misinformed if you think you're "not paying for it". Who do you think pays for it? The government does, right...and where do you think the government gets the money to pay for it? They get it by increasing taxes to the point that citizens of some countries with socialized healthcare pay 50+% of their income in taxes.    You make the perfect argument against socialized healthcare in your question. "Medicare system can easily take advantage of our money and prevent us from having necessary medical treatment." Who do you think runs Medicare & Medicaid? The government! If Medicare & Medicaid are so poorly ran by the government, why would it be any different if they took control of all healthcare?    Healthcare reform needs to start with overhauling insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the lawsuit-happy "malpractice" people. Leaving healthcare to the government is lunacy.    Do yourself a favor, quit watching Michael Moore and start thinking for yourself.    EDIT: homegirl, Americans go to Canada for prescription drugs because it's cheaper. Canada doesn't have the same FDA guidelines as the U.S. Again, this is why pharmaceutical companies need to be overhauled.    I have watched the movie.|`|Vvgnw0iuaa	The taxes are out the @ss in those countries too  and anything that comes out of Micael Moore's mouth is a load of sh!t anyways
AA11494150	If you carry a weapon in the normal course of your duties, you are covered under HR214, The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004. It allows any peace officer to carry off duty anywhere in the United States.     Most corrections officers, with the exception of the tower guards, do not carry a weapon in the normal course of their duties, so they have no extra privilege.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	With a permit like the rest of us.

So unless they have a concealed carry permit they are in the same boat as the rest of us.   Except in a few states where they are allowed to carry off duty.

AA12330575	If, indeed, there is any liability it would be on the part of New Hampshire, not Massachusetts.  Unortunately, you must obtain permission from the 'king' before you can sue the 'king'.   New Hampshire is unlikely to give you permission to sue the state.  It was not a wrongful arrest on the part of Massachusetts.  Retired peace officer.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	It wasn't wrongful arrest since the police computer showed you as committing a violation.   It was a clerical error by the NH authority.    This does not mean you don't have a case,  you just need to direct it the right way.   Call a lawyer and speak with them about it,   chances are that this wouldn't even end up going to trial,  they would likely settle up with you out of court.    Good luck.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	If your license came back suspended when the Officer ran it then the arrest was valid because it was based on probable cause.  Dollars to donuts that is what happened.  Like any bureaucracy mistakes happen and things fall through the cracks.  Some clerk somewhere forgot to file something and your license got revoked.  It sucks for you but the Officer acted appropriately.|`|TItRpckpaa	the arrest wasn't really wrongfull because in their system it said you were suspended so the cop just did his job, everyone says "no I paid that".  The judge agreed there was a mistake so as far as your losses I would keep recieps and ask if there may be some way to write it off on your taxes.

GE6EDrWAaa	Yes being a Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent is a good career.  If you are interested in being a federal agent while spending a a significant part of your career living and working overseas, then DSS might be the place for you.  You will be required to move about every 2-3 years and can expect to do your first 2-3 years domestically in a field office with a handful of temporary duty protection assignments overseas.      DSS is NOT an easy agency to get into.  One reason is that there are not that many agents compared to other agencies such as the FBI, ATF, ICE, etc.  DSS has openings usually only once a year and sometimes less frequently than that.  The best way to see when they are hiring is by checking the U.S. Department of State website.  On the website you will also see that there are opportunities to become a Foreign Service Officer (FSO).  Also very competitive but very rewarding.  FSOs have many opportunities to learn foreign languages and spend most of their careers working at U.S. embassies and consulates overseas.  These are the folks that are diplomats.      As for what you should study in college, just study what you are interested in.  A bachelors degree is required and good grades are importatnt.  There are agents that have degrees in criminal justice, history, international relations, psychology, foreign languages, and law.  If you are particulary interested in law enforcement, criminal justice is always good and being fluent in Spanish is definitely a plus.    When you get ready to graduate from college, I would recommend that you apply to numerous agencies and go from there.  Kind of a shotgun effect, you apply for a lot of jobs and take the best offer.  It's not unusual to start out with one department and then move on to another as opportunities become available.  A lot of federal agents have also started their careers as local or state police officers.  Which is definitely not a bad way to start out and get some good street law enforcement experience.         For federal jobs go to www.usajobs.opm.gov   Remember to keep your options open and stay focused in college.    Good luck!|`|l2MjVVpRaa	As security guard jobs go, it's not bad.    As law enforcement jobs so, it's not so hot.     It's not law enforcement,,, at all. They don't investigate anything, they don't leave the assigned are or individual.    Personally, I wouldn't wan the job
HVeeieB2aa	He was probably "punished" because he entered the US illegally (without a work permit). He is required BY LAW to go back to his originating country for AT LEAST 3 years. I looked up information on my fiance who entered illegally from Mexico and found out that he would be forced to turn himself in at the border within a date the judge gives him, be "punished" for at least 3 years, and then he can begin the process of legally returning to the US. The thing is that depending on the specifics (i.e. he has a family in the US that depend on him) he may be able to be granted entry much sooner.

But understand that we played a part in making them the monsters they are in order to stop from creating more monsters in the future, yes.    The pattern of the United States backing one favored up-and-coming political figure in order to get rid of the old favorite, while turning a blind eye to the new guy's abuses of power and oppressive tendencies is short-sighted and dangerous. Look how many of the dictators who eventually become our sworn enemies started out as our ally. It's time we realize that when you sacrifice the rule of law in order to take a free ride along with a political upstart, you end up creating a situation that is as bad or worse as the one you were trying to escape from to begin with.

AA11303747	If you are someone's next of kin, or spouse, than you can have them committed to a facility, if you can prove to the state judiciary that said person has an inherent inability to care for themselves. This can only be done if you are the next of kin, spouse, or sometimes a sibling can do this as well. This is also true of mental conditions as well. But the main factor is being able to prove that if no action is taken, then that person is liable to do harm to themselves or others.

Do you really think if HR did call your manager in, they would tell you ?    So how exactly do you know they did nothing ? Did you expect them to fire your manager over the issue ?    As a supervisor over 58 employees in a large manufacturer, over 3,000 employees, I have had dealings with employees complaining to HR about me personally and about my associate supervisors.    In NO instance would the complaining employee be informed about HR and senior managements decision regarding the complaint unless is was an immediate firing offense.    I would more than likely say, that your manager was called in and informed that a complaint had been made( respectable companies do not tell the manager who made the complaint) and told that such comments arn't to be tolerated.    Companies do keep records of all complaints against supervisors and manegement on file, if a supervisor or manager gets to many of the same type complaints, they do get fired.    Just a note you you as an employee, constant complaints about petty matters about a supervisor or manager, can get you classified as a trouble maker( which is not a bad thing in itself), which can lead to any REAL and Serious complaints you may have, being ignored or not taken as seriously.    In the complaint you spoke about here, i'd say you should have approached the manager personaly about the comment, it really wasn't the type of comment to take to HR.    But just remember, the same way disciplinary measures concerning your employment are handled in private( atleast I hope they are), the disciplinary measures concerning your manager, will be handled in private.|`|0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Report the irregularity to the most senior official so that appropriate action will be made against your manager.|`|3a3e83cdd82c6f01cb6edf265e614ddbaa	I don't see why that would be wrong.

Go up another level and report it.|`|21d1f12aab8b2f3771bee2912c3e2dfdaa	Yes. Your manager has the right to freely express her opinions.

And as for 'socialism', well - we have had corporate socialism for many years.  Our taxes have gone into the pockets of the rich.  Did they create jobs with the money?  Hell no, they moved their jobs to third world countries and kept their big profits hidden from the IRS.  If the new spending bill/stimulus plan is socialism which benefits the American people, then I'm all for it.
gUhvARDdaa	Most economists have no interest in the issue. What's more, the most influential economist of the last century, John Maynard Keynes, hated the gold standard with astonishing intensity, and he considered it his great accomplishment in life to have assisted in its destruction. Even to this day, his influence is immense, with most economists accepting the broad framework that he laid out in his work, and sharing his conviction that the worst thing that could befall any society is for the government to lose its power to manage economic life.    Why do the government and its partisans dislike the gold standard? It removes the discretionary power of the Fed by placing severe limits on the ability of the central bank to inflate the money supply. Without that discretionary power, the government has far fewer tools of central planning at its disposal. Government can regulate, which is a function of the police power. It can tax, which involves taking people's property. And it can spend, which means redistributing other people's property. But its activities in the financial area are radically curbed.     Think of your local and state governments. They tax and spend. They manipulate and intervene. As with all governments from the beginning of the time, they generally retard social progress and muck things up as much as possible. What they do not do, however, is run huge deficits, accumulate trillions in debt, reduce the value of money, bail out foreign governments, provide endless credits to failing enterprises, administer hugely expensive and destructive social insurance schemes, or bring about immense swings in business activity.    State and local governments are awful and they must be relentlessly checked, but they are not anything like the threat of the federal government. Neither are they as arrogant and convinced of their own infallibility and indispensability. They lack the aura of invincibility that the central government enjoys.    It is the central bank, and only the central bank, that works as the government's money machine, and this makes all the difference.    Once you begin to understand the role of the monetary regime in the building of the modern statist enterprise  in providing the means of funding for the entire welfare-warfare state, in generating financial instability, in destroying savings and undermining living standards  you realize that there is far too little interest in the subject in the mainstream press. You begin to realize that the 19th century focus on the money issue was entirely appropriate.     Once having read Mises or Rothbard or any number of great monetary theorists, you begin to realize that understanding the monetary regime is the key that unlocks the mysteries of political control in our time. The Fed was created not to scientifically manage the economy  as the journals claimed at the time  but because it met the institutional needs of both the government and the banking industry. The government sought a means of finance that didn't depend on taxation, and the banking industry sought what Rothbard called a cartelization device. That is to say, the banking industry was seeking some way to prevent competitive pressures between banks from limiting their ability to expand credit.     Well, the central bank fit the bill. A central bank managing a currency that is not tied to anything real fits the bill even better. If a little power to inflate is good for the government and its connected banking and financial interests, a lot of power to inflate is even better. For this reason, it was very likely that the gold standard could not have survived the creation of a central bank, and, for the same reason, the creation of a new gold standard will have to do away with the central bank that would always threaten to bring it down.     The power to create money is the most ominous power ever bestowed on any human being. This power is rightly criminalized when it is exercised by private individuals, and even today, everyone knows why counterfeiting is wrong and knavish. Far fewer are aware of the role of the federal government, the Fed, and the fiat dollar in making possible the largest counterfeiting operation in human history, which is called the world dollar standard. Fewer still understand the connection between this officially sanctioned criminality and the business cycle, the rise and collapse of the stock market, and the continued erosion of the value of the dollar.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	I'm with the radical 25%.

RermzbWgaa	I am a Republican and have to say the only complaint I have about the salary cap is that it is far too high!  The idiots that accepted bailout money need to understand that they no longer have the freedom to waste a single dollar.  They owe the United States and until we get paid back I say.....make it VERY VERY painful for them.    Besides, obviously, these executives are UTTER failures....none of them should be getting compensated at all let alone 500K.  Those individuals have added zero value.....actually have cost their companies billions of dollars through their bad decisions.   The stock holders should be sending them a bill.....not paying them a GD dollar.    Those companies are on the dole now.  Until they get off that I do not care if the government decides to set them ablaze daily so that the neighborhood can warm their toes, or whores them out on the street corner.|`|9PAavWnyaa	So far I haven't heard anyone voice anger at the salary cap. Perhaps you can post a reference site.|`|kVTryKlBaa	I have no problem with it at all, but lets start at the top, by revoking the pay raise everyone in Congress just got.  did they do a good job?  Did they earn a raise with their actions?    If not, then they have no business running their mouths about anyone else.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Where was your outrage when congress voted themselves a pay raise?

Conservatives are not happy about FAILING BUSINESSES getting tax payers money to stay alive.  They are failing for a reason.  Its not Govt. job to say who lives and who dies in the market.    2.

That's Socialism, Communism, etc etc.  Notice Venezuela, Former USSR, Cuba, etc etc.  Its the Employees and Stock owners job to tell the business how to run.|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	Lets put it this way.  You are a CEO of a major corporation.  You have a contract signed by you and the board of directors of that company.  You have agreed to work for a specified amount of money per year.  What gives the President the right to say that your contract is null and void?  Our bail-out money should have very thick strings attached.  It should cover such things as bonuses and redecorating.  I also feel that it shouldn't be free money.  It should be in the form of short-term loans with a high rate of interest but to declare legal contracts null and void gives the government way too much power over these companies.  How long before the government comes in and says how much they can pay you and me.|`|tu2VbI0zaa	Well i am personally not angry about salary caps...I really don't like the idea of the whole bailout...

Obama and Bush are BOTH wrong in giving these "bailouts" to wall street in the first place & the president (Obama) telling private businesses what their pay caps should be and what severance packages they can have is UNCONSTITUTIONAL. The president should not have a say over which contracts private corporations enter in to nor should the president be able to put restrictions on such contracts. The more the federal government "gives" the more it can take away. It may just be big, faceless corporations now, but it could be citizens next. This is the real cost of the bailouts, we are giving up more than just money.   This is precisely WHY taxpayer money should never be used for this purpose.  In the bigger picture this is why Republicans (well, real Republicans) & Libertarians value small federal government.   Ideally we want to limit government intervention in our private lives and we want to uphold the standards put forth by the founding fathers.|`|zrthZOCdaa	Where is your outrage about Barney Frank,Dodd, Waters causing our meltdown with F&F?  These people should be in jail for what they did.|`|YcTOXKdaaa	Several points to my answer.    A) The companies shouldn't be bailed out at all. Keeping failing companies around and giving them money is capital destruction, meaning future companies will have less money available to do productive activities in the future. Furthermore, free markets have been dead in America for decades.    B) The $18 billion "windfall" that bankers received was on an individual basis, e.g., it was compensation for work done, not a bonus as has been reported by the media.    C) Imposing salary limits is counter-intuitive to the idea that we can spend our way out of the recession. Imagine how many people are going to be out of work now that the bankers can't spend their huge salaries on cars, houses, etc.    D) Imposing salary caps will devastate tax coffers. Instead of having multimillion dollar salaries to tax, it's going to only be $500,000. Say good bye to government services.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	While I have no problem with the addition of conditions to a taxpayer-funded bailout...I believe that the tactic Obama is using is fraught with danger.    First, I think that this is a move clearly aimed at capitalizing on the anger and emotion of the people, and not one that is particularly well thought out.  This kind of tactic is OK during a election campaign, but once in power, you would think that a President would be more....I dunno...."Presidential"    Next, wouldn't it have been better if he had not targeted "executive" salaries?  What about pensions?  What about union workers making $80,000 while they do less work than a non-union worker making $50,000?  All those things add up quicker than the bloated salary of one or two execs.    Those things would have been political suicide for any Democrat ... and it should be clear to all by now that Obama is a politician first and a "changer" second.    If he wanted real change, he should have added a requirement that each company receiving bailout funds had to submit a written "Recovery Plan" which would then be reviewed by Congress in open hearings and not the White House.  It seems more American to allow the companies to come up with their own Plan rather than have it enforced upon them by the White House.|`|be5d02d1dc7db03c5839affa5d0d722faa	They keep defending the rich for some unknown reason    Now...that is just not right    Those caps are only for any bank in the future and only for any who use gov. funds    Not the ones who already got the funds...they mad damn sure of that and can kiss the first half of the tarp money good-bye the bonus anyway    They seem to be angry because some in their party are afraid of gov. interference of all  business    Going on and on about their rights and do not read what has taken place    Hear from them more because anything President Obama does is and will be wrong    In 15 days, 15 months, 4 Years or 8    Sit back and watch them rant it quite funny actually|`|ulzWumWPaa	Its govt interference into the 'free market' which would take care of corrupt banks and all involved ceo's.

Do I take the job?....No.     What this does is prevent the Boards of Directors from hiring the best people for their companies.

The buck stops here.|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	I think that it is amazing how people can be scared into allowing something they never would have considered before.  It is truly stunning, and I now have a glimpse into how Hitler was able to get Germans to go along with what he was doing.      The last 8 years really have shown the difference between "my team" and "your team" when it comes to trusting the judgment of the executive leadership.  I can only imagine how the conservatives of this nation would have reacted if Clinton wanted to monitor credit card transactions and domestic communications to monitor for the next Tim McVeigh.    The US tried and convicted and imprisoned Japanese officers for water boarding.  Their efforts were to determine threats to their military and nation.  Yet somehow when we do it, its okay.  The Soviets sent East Germans to Siberia for torture and indefinite detention using a kangaroo court.  But closing Guantanamo would be the fall of this nation according to Cheney.      I can't claim to know if any useful information came from torture because I don't have that level of security clearance.  I do know that numerous seasoned interrogators have agreed that torture rarely yields anything useful.    Instead, I want you to consider something else for a moment.  To understand this you'll need to be in the mindset that - the fine for "accidental discharge" of waste is almost always cheaper that paying for proper disposal. - If you want to ensure that Islamic fundamentalist terrorism becomes the next Cold War money maker, then you have to stimulate the process.  The best way to do this is to torture and hold someone's cousin indefinitely.  The best way to do this is to insult their culture and their religion so they feel an inflamed sense of pride and will want to fight back.  The best way to do this is place your troops on their soil, prop up their illegal dictators, and take their natural resources without proper compensation.    There used to be a time when the Marines provided security for our embassies and diplomats.  Now we hire private contractors.  Soldiers used to prepare food and build the infrastructure they needed.  Now we hire private contractors.    Consider that Cheney's old company, Halliburton, has a stock price of $23.37 during May 2001.  Prior to the announcement of a no-bid contract for Halliburton to provide support services in Iraq, the stock was trading at $11.85 during May 2003.  Since that time, the stock increased peaked at $52 in June 2008, even though the broader market turned sharply down.  The stock is now around $18.  As an odd coincidence, the Iraq Commander Casey submitted plans for sharp troop withdrawls from Iraq in June 2008.    There are very big players that see this "War On Terror" as an on-going way to milk the federal government/tax payers and make massive profits.  To keep the gravy train coming, you have to poke the bull in the *ss, then send in the poor kids with few other options in life "for America", and sit in your gated community while your portfolio grows.  You're asking about the poking of the bull in the *ss.

I have never ever been late paying tax or tried to pay less or whatever people do to cheat.  I know now that taxes are important. I live accross the street from a school so I see my taxes to work each day.  I use the library & love that it is there for me & others. So I really appreciate having money to pay taxes.  My son makes a lot of money & he never complains about paying taxes so I am not sure what your reason for the question but Yes, liberals do pay taxes & yet they do work & yet they don't always like it but they don't complain as much as republicans cause we are more likely to see that they are insurance to having a great country. Yes, we know some times the money is not used properly. The answer is to do what we can to make sure our money is not misused but to stop helping others is not what I see as a way to improve my life. The better my countrymen & women the better for me.

I happen to know one of the "BNP wives".I have spoken to suzy cass on various ocasions and they have portrayed her in a very bad light.      alas, the BNP have been expecting the inevitable smear campaign from the media.I'm happy though, it shows they see us as a threat.    Edit:  We are competing in the euro's for the same reason as UKIP-we want out, and we want to send a message to the EU that britain wants out.Also, each MEP earns 60,000, the BNP has a policy whereby 15% of your earnings if you are elected goes straight back into the BNP, so 3 MEP's would equal 27k a year extra for the BNP-or enough for another truth truck.    Anyway, i dont think the BNP wives were that bad, the programme made them look worse than they were.    I would volunteer to go on one of those shows-it could be called "BNP Gold Members" and it would show the public the real BNP-Proud British patriots doing there best for there country.|`|k6fGdpZRaa	Ha ha, thick b1tches, feel really sorry for their kids though x

Its been twisted to no end this subject, thats all the founding fathers were talking about,-  The Church of England|`|e4fdad2a4b8172efe8cf20fd51951036aa	President Bush began the program for federally-funded faith-based initiatives largely to help side-step separation issues and make it possible for more religious organizations to get their social assistance programs funded by the federal government.    A valid use for such a department, however, would be to use it to ensure that when religious groups run genuinely beneficial and important charitable or social assistance programs, they are helped to do so in a way that avoids separation of church and state-type conflicts.  For example, if your local church decides to open a soup kitchen or a food pantry, the federal government should support that effort *as long as* the program is genuinely open to everyone in the community (not just members of the religious group or congregation) and is not used as a vehicle to recruit.|`|7PTZJ74vaa	First of all the phrase, separation of church and state is not in the Constitution. I wish people in this country would actually read the Constitution instead of being spoon feed by the liberal media as to what is in it. The phrase did originate with Thomas Jefferson but not in the Constitution. In a letter Jefferson wrote to a church is where the phrase is found not any founding documents. It was a minority church that was afraid that they would not be allowed to worship in their own way, (they probably wanted to do something politically incorrect like pray in Jesuss name or teach what the Bible says about homosexuality being a sin). Anyway Jefferson told them not to worry because there was, a separation of church and state, that prevented the state from telling the church how they could worship. The liberals have taken this letter out of context not out of the Constitution and tried to make it say that you must keep religion out of public life. That is not what it says at all! In fact the letter says the exact opposite government can not tell you when and where or how you can worship. By the way praying in Jesuss name is one way we all can worship him where ever we want.|`|Joz0jTwGaa	yes. it is in direct contradiction of the same|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	What he is doing is going against the separation of church and state.

The existence of the office isn't a violation of church and state.  That principle is about not letting a church set our nation's public policy.  There's no reason for faith based organizations who do charitable works to be excluded from the sort of partnerships other charitable organizations foster.    I'm not religious but I don't object to this religious groups working in partnership with government agencies so long as they are not using public funds to proselytize.|`|um87XJvmaa	I thought Bush started the 'faith based initiative department"|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	There is no such thing as a "Separation of Church and State".    That is a concept that the liberals use in order to suppress religious freedom as well as restrict the rights of the states to govern themselves.    Did you know that right after the Constitution was ratified those same people at the Convention went home and wrote state Constitutions? Out of the 13, 11 had specific language banning religions or only allowing Christianity... that tells me that their intent was pretty plain: The FEDERAL government cannot make a law creating a religion or interfering with the free exercise of it, however the people in any state CAN.

Were I the executive in question, I'd change nothing now and tell the government they can't change my employment agreement currently in force.    If/when a private employer arbitrarily attempts to do so, it amounts to an immediate termination and the previously agreed severance applies at that moment.  [I've experience with this.]    ***  The time to get executive pay restraint is before you put your money in, not after.      Unless, of course, the money makes you the controlling shareholder -- in which case, we've effectively nationalized the banks, haven't we?    and then severance would still apply and under the old agreement.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	It is not a problem.  The executives with talent and a history of being productive will move to smaller private equity firms who did not take TARP money.

Not true, but is the reason being floated.
Qou0CLwiaa	I don't know if you are a fool or not but you don't understand economics.    1st of all, you can't patent an idea. you can patent a non-novel invention that is not already covered by other patents.    if there is any prior art, your patent can be ruled invalid, even after having been granted, which means if you ever mentioned it in only a little more detail then here, and evidence of that turns up, then that will be that.    or if anyone else ever wrote down the same or substantially similar idea, then that will be that.    filing for and prosecuting a patent is not cheap.     you might not care about a "profit", but that will cost money.    so will keeping people from infringing on your patent, for profit or not.    if you want to give stuff away, that is your business, but you still need to pay for all of the above, and production, marketing, and sales of your idea.     None of that is free, and if you do a half-assed job, then what does your conscience tell you if others could have done it better and lives are lost because you were not able to optimize the availability of your product because you didn;'t understand the implications?    Here is an example - google search is free, right? Yet how did they go from 5 employees to 50,000 in only 5 years when their product is free?    Answer - because they hired people who really understood finance and the value added to the product by money, marketing, and sales, and people who knew how to set up the best distribution network for their invention so the most people could benefit from it.    You would do well to study and heed that and similar examples instead of blustering that you "understand  economics"|`|AA12229787	If you have a good idea..Why would you not want to profit from it?  Dont be a fool...|`|z88IMXNFaa	You cannot patent an idea.

Typically, law firms use skip tracers to locate people.|`|AA10599026	Yes, you can file again, but you'll need to locate the other party pretty fast -- this time, try to find a correct address for them before you file, so you won't run out of time.     Try their DMV listing, or you might have to do a background check. If you have the money, instead of getting the deputies to attempt service, hire an attorney's service, because they will be able to run background checks and skip-searches to locate the person you're trying to sue.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	Probably - unless it was dismissed "with prejudice".

(thanks to repayments to everybody, rebuilding the country etc etc) and things did just get bad to worse for them. in the 1923's they originally just printed more money,(hyperinflation)  which as i presume you know, just didn't work, causing their money worthless. anyway, the long story short, they produced a new currency.  anyway, in real answer to your question, this is what they did. they spent money on re-building the country such as transport links, factories, hospitals, new buildings etc, thus creating 1000's of new jobs. this then aided with the shocking unemployment figures. subsequently more money was in the economy, people had more money to spend.   so in answer to your question, yes if they are wise and spend it in the most needed and most beneficial for our country.|`|zA4X6yEUaa	It all depends on how the receivers of the money respond. If they in turn pump it into the economy then things will pick up. It's a short term fix though. People need to live within their means & then producers will respond to that demand rather than over-extending themselves in investments that will meet a short term demand because everybody is spending money they don't have.

PS:  WW2 is terrible, but it brought about a benefit to the economy.    To Eric R: Keynes is the reason why we are enjoying the fruit of capitalism today. What did Friedman's stinky ideology did? Absolutely nothing! Tax cuts benefits business and people WHEN ECONOMY IS GOOD, not when its bad. In time of recession, you need to spur flow of money through credits and loans. When you instigate tax cuts, will companies and people go on spending spree? I dont think so. They will put it somewhere where the money will freeze...Badly needed money to stimulate the economy.

It is a period of reduced economic activity.  If money is pumped into the economy, jobs are created, people spend money and increased economic activity occurs.    This would jumpstart the economy, as opposed to just tax cuts which would take a long time, if ever to get the economy moving.    Is it good for the long term?  No.  But it is better than the economic policies of the last 8 years that helped put us in this situation.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	No it's nearly impossible i know the thinking of we spend money giving it to people and they will in return spend it then feel it's ok to spend money more. When honestly if they want to spend money then the need to spend money in to creating more jobs so people can make more money to spend more money. That's the only way we made it out of the last recession we need more jobs, need more money, need less exportation of jobs, more USA made items that's the only way or we will stay in a slight recession.|`|My65doewaa	Well.. anything is possible I guess, but it's never worked in the past...|`|IFVrLCNOaa	no. at most, it's like giving someone a quick shot of epinephrine. in other words, they will get a bit of juice going in the economy as far as the infrastructure jobs. those workers will buy gas and food etc.  and, hopefully, the businesses will sustain and be viable on their own.  once the project is done, some of the econoy will pull back too. it's not perfect. it comes and goes.|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	NO.

AA11047076	Learn the facts before trying to spread misinformation:    The way the Beis Din works in Britain, the USA and in fact everywhere in the world is as follows:  * The people have to AGREE to use the Beis Din as the ruling authority.    * The Beis Din acts as an arbitrator whose decision (if necessary) is then taken to a civil court for enforcement as an arbitration agent, not a court.   * The Beis din arbitration has three judges- one appointed by the plaintiff, one by the defendant and one by the other two judges.  * Any civil enforcement is through the regular civil courts- the Beis Din can use cherem (a form of excommunication) as a threat to enforce a rulng- but their ruling has no civil authority.    In other words, the Beis Din merely acts as an arbitration agent as would any other civil arbitrator in a hearing.    In fact, your article states this directly:  " The service provided by the Beth Din is best described as binding civil arbitration, and they do not seek to replace the state's civil courts.

What bugs is, the Calendar and discussions, that only lead into  longer periods of planning to take care of that part of every bodies home office.  My best guess 2010 being transposed into 2011. Netherlands long line of  big winded busy bodies losing track of their duties towards the Tax Payers, indeed posed a too big a problem, to risk any further exposure for the Systems workers in State Office's inclination to act out criminal offenses against their proper bosses, who are Tax Payers.  Besides this subject is a matter of Work Groups designated to do a task, who then ignore, their personal best interest, and ignore the Nationality I keep and which position I am elevated to. To assist in transitions and adjustments, dealing with Globalization and Development..    That, which I am bound to hand over out of Politicians , mine, and other Institutes control to keep sterile and in a Mint Condition for verification purpose, is a suggested data bank, with bloopers, proper judgments that qualify Merci over Judgment,  With a Blooper, the court file case qualifies from sheer blunders to racist judgment calls, gross injustices, and misconducts, leading to mistrials,   The Size I had hoped to remain a solid 100.000 Files on Archive in this way.    The purpose is simply to Unify the judicial system, and simplify costs, and Procedures.  A Data bank, which is a fully operational Sharebase, accecibla for all education networks. Not only does our Economy depend on a very strong leadership Gliobally,that can tackle corruption, which gnaws at our seats. It needs Resource that is above any board decicion anywhere.    The Countries that would be chosen for such an undertaking should develope seperately from eachothers work proposals, but for comparison, they should also lead the Information Route to be taken towards the Unified System and Goal of This Worldwide Program.  Ny idea is when there's no way we can go back we should revive instead of sleep to the drum of the automated World Core.    Fatalism is amongst other things, the biggest dangers for system guards (Courthouse, Lawfirm, Registrations and aministration + Workers). For the sake of challenging the Courthouse, I published my private defense against Housing Corperation as an exam English for The Kanton Arnhem. It would be a waste,not to come to a startup sphere, instead of the Lame Duck Site, The collective Court Sites are doomed to sleep on forever, and miss the second dead line too, while all 2010, meant, it was designated dead line. What planning did forget, is my active role inside the QWEB, and the vast amount of energies, supporting this as evidence..    It is after all our structural Rol\e and Arcchituectural Obligation to the World, that it is being put to good use, such as answering this question, to lead on in The Answer to Technology, that we can proceed with a nect infusion, which otherwise would also be lost to us in our immediate data sphere.    I see indeed why a 100.000 files is a low estimate, when it comes to collecting the data, that also have to preserve cultural heritage in case of criminal justice. A Business System, would take less steps to overcome National differences more often then not.  The Data bases, serves as a builder formula for Automated Servers in Capacity programmed by it's workers, that feed  the files into systems, to extrapolate a common ground ruling. This way we can avoid cutlural differences, that would lead to populus feeling disregarded by backbenchers handing out false information by hijacking identity.

In the U.S., arbitration is allowed -- even encouraged -- and arbitration rulings are generally fully enforceable in the civil courts.  I think the rules are similar in the UK.  Should a court being asked to enforce an arbitration say: "Yes, I will issue a writ enforcing this arbitration rulin. . . . -- HEY, wait a minute!!  Were there rabbis on this arbitration panel?  Were the arbitration rules agreed to by the parties the same as the rules that would apply under Jewish law???  If so, then NO, I won't enforce this!"

Now it is becoming a government entity.     There is no separation of church and state.  That was a notion created by an Ex KKK member who was appointed to the supreme court by FDR.  He created the separation because he was afraid that someday the government would force white churches to accept black members.    All the constitution states is this:  1.  The government cannot force you into one religion or another.  2.  The government cannot stop you from practicing your religion.    They have never broke the first rule, but they break the 2nd one on a daily basis.

EDIT:  people negative rate this comment?  These are facts he actually did these things during his time in office so far.  You guys are so anti-Obama you can't accept the good things he's done.

AA12330575	Entrapment by any police agency anywhere in the U.S. is illegal and is not a common practice.  The dumbest defense lawyer in the country could easily get their client found Not Guilty if the police were to use any kind of entrapment to make an arrest.  Most people do not understand what constitutes 'entrapment'.  Entrapment occurs when the police actively recruit innocent citizens to commit a crime that the citizen had never considered.  Using undercover officers in various kinds of stings to arrest criminals is not entrapment.  Undercoverpolice have absolutely no requirement to tell criminals that they are police; even if asked.  That's a ludicrous idea.  Retired peace officer.|`|AA11206283	Child porn is illegal. IF you are visiting those links, you are breaking the law. No one has to tell you this.|`|WrDGhduxaa	The police and FBI entrap people all of the time.  The only defense is if you can prove they enticed you to do something you would not have done on your own.  Most defenses against entrapment fail.  Child porn is always a crime and should be punished.  Other crimes, especially ones without actual victims are less defensible when it comes to entrapment.   Yes many governments especially cities make laws to increase their revenue and for no other justifiable reason.|`|d5348844fa0d0a525f373ae1f2bf3a78aa	child porn is illegal in every form. so even looking at it makes it a crime. entrapment is simply when an individual asks someone if they are a cop. by law, if someone is a cop they have to say yes. if they say no and something you say to them gets you in trouble, then that is entrapment and is illegal. so unless a pedophile asks a cop if they are in fact a law enforcement officer, then it's fine.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Child Porn goes with out saying...  It is illegal...    Actually what I wish to address is the  way Law Enforcement has changed   over the last 30-40 years...    It has become the norm for Police at  any level to "Entrap" people using stings  and paid informants...  Some times spending years and thousands  of dollars to talk someone into doing something  illegal  such as spending 2 years to get someone  to shorten the barrel on a shotgun...    There isn't enough Crime that they have to  go about staging and making up more by  their illegal action...    There is No Law that says they can do this...NONE !!!    Then using Military assault tactics to kill  an innocent Baby during the arrest by  shooting through a door that they could  not see behind...where a mother holding  her baby was..    Time to get the Police out of the Black Military   assault clothes and back into Police Uniforms...  We are not supposed to have a "Gestapo"...  Where have all the Real Police Officer's gone ???    Geez...they even have a New TV Show that   you will become accustomed to seeing them...  It is called "Brainwashing"...  No wonder no one trusts Cops anymore,  they have become US & Them.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Its not entrapment.    Entrapment would be charging you after encouraging and convincing you to go to the links. (that you would not visit normally).    Just "making the links available" and waiting for someone to click isn't entrapment however,  since you are not being forced to go to them.

From what I hear women are in great danger from their fellow soldiers from rape, murder,etc.  What is the matter with you guys? I think moms should be home with their children for the sake of the children not the moms. Nothing can take the place of a mother during early years of childhood.

We say horsepower because that was how our ancestors translated what they knew, animal power, into something new and unknown, machine power.  Today horsepower is an anachronism as most people have no concept of what a horse is capable of.    Thus it is with the word frontline.  In a day when men fought in ranks and moved on foot, the concept of a frontline made sense.  But today with the mobility of modern transportation along with modern communications and weapons, there is no frontline.  It's an anachronistic idea.  That there are distinct times and places for combat and neat divisions between combat and civilian are gone.  Women can and will engage in combat.

8tf5rOXdaa	This is a graphic example of the murder of abortion. People who yawn at it turn my stomach.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	We all wish we lived in a perfect world.  Unfortunately, we do not.  Medical errors happen whether performing abortions or heart surgery or removing tonsils.  Sometimes the patient dies.    In our imperfect world women and girls are raped, are victims of incest, abuse, coercion and poor judgment.  Sometimes pregnancies are imperfect and the woman risks her life by carrying to term.  All of this is real.    You may choose to ignore reality if you wish; I do not.  Giving birth to a child is not your choice. It is the choice of each individual woman.  It is up to her to decide on the circumstances of her life and if she is ready to bear/mother a child.  You, and your political friends, have nothing to say about it and, hopefully, never will.

That doesn't change my opinion on being pro-choice.|`|AA11847612	I am pro-choice as well, and Marcia you are WAY off. (Assuming the facts are true) This is a case of murder, not malpractice. If you can't see that, then you are blind and really need to check your head.    Live birth does not equate botched abortion. Botched abortion is when the doctor messes up and causes harm to the woman. Live birth is LIVE BIRTH. That means a living human being, not a fetus. Not an embryo. A living human being.    This "doctor" and any employee of the clinic who participated in this, is guilty of murder (the woman has no culpability in this). You don't mess up an abortion, turn it into a live birth, and then chuck the baby in the trash. That's absurd, immoral and unspeakable. I hope they all get what they deserve (again, assuming the facts in the story are true).|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	I've stated numerous times that as long as it is in the first trimester (which is the first 3 months/12 weeks) then I have no problem with someone having the choice.  The life is not viable at that stage.    What you're talking about is murder and you're purposely confusing the issue to try and prove a political point.    In effect, you're politicizing a tragedy.

tyvFUPOxaa	Treason and 5000+ murders are crimes that should end in a death penalty; but we're talking about dear old Dick and George. I doubt that they will get more than a slap on their wrists with an ostrich feather. With the way Bush II and Cheney the I left our nation in financial ruins, they may become of less concern for people who are losing their jobs, homes, and investments. But this is a big nation and a lot of people know the sources of their plights.|`|IM30PoPNaa	Cheney is Evil.  I'd say that Abu Ghraib and Gitmo were the best recruiting tools the terrorists ever had.  Launching a war on a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 or Al Qaeda was a stupid waste of blood and resources that allowed the terrorists to regroup in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Furthermore, Iraq and Iran held each other nicely in check.  Now with Iraq destroyed, Iran is free to export its version of extremist Islam.    Funny thing though: if Cheney says that any attack from here on out is Obama's fault, then isn't he implying that 9/11 was his and Bush's fault?  Is this finally his backhand way of taking responsibility at least for that?  .|`|xkcLOfTKaa	First of all... For 8 years (which by the way saw more than 1/2 a dozen attacks on the U.S. both home and abroad, and more than 1000 U.S. citizens KILLED), Clinton did nothing to stop what everyone KNEW was coming.    What he DID do, along with Pelosi, is change federal law enforcement rules that would not allow FBI and CIA agents present evidence they needed for warrants against AT LEAST 2 of the 9/11 hijackers..    It was being planned as far back as 1998... And CLINTON KNEW ABOUT IT!    1993 - WTC bombed  1996 - U.S. housing in Saudi Arabia bombed  1998 - 2 U.S. Embassies in Africa bombed  2000 - U.S.S. Cole in Yemen bombed    How many terrorist attacks have been successful since 2001?    Come one now. If you are going to spew hate, AT LEASE have the courage to give all sides... give ALL facts!

Dick Cheney and President Obama's right hand man, Vice President Joe Biden are exactly right.  Obama will be challenged by a terrorist attack precisely because he has weakened our position in the world and pandered to those who would see the USA destroyed.  What's most true about 9-11 is that it occured during Bush's presidency but the planning and the execution for the plan begain during the Clinton years.    In terms of debt, the Democrats have had the Congress for two plus years...and what have they done?  Nada, nothing...and in fact, now want to increase our national debt by more than a trillion dollars with a single stroke of the pen.      There are no apologies to be given for Iraq.  Hussein was a despot and the recent Iraqi free elections and continued assumption of their own national security is a testament to the Bush doctrine and the sacrifices made by our men in women in uniform.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	You're right about one thing.

BLMh0dG6aa	Never existed, conservative rhetoric    Capitalism is defined as a good idea rising to the top, bringing the one who thought it to the top with it.    Even if one ignores the fact that history- including American History- shows that when a good idea makes it to the top its usually because someone with more money and/or better connections stole it; passing this off as a lie designed to make the system work by causing people to be trusting enough to have their ideas more easily stolen for the betterment of the system:    It still wouldn't explain away the fact that those who create and/or profit from and/or perpetuate Ghettos and the third world break down the very structures which would allow these thoughts and ideas from rising to the top.    And furthermore that the people doing this realize this, and feel the money is instead coming from such oppressions; which by-in-large it is.    So usually the term is used it merely is used to justify what people high up in business would do anyway, and to discourage opposition of this, even if it seems to not be beneficial to the whole.    So why do so many people still think our money comes from Capitalism, or even that we are capitalistic; especially since We've never had a society not dependent upon slavery, weather Native Americans enslaved by Conquistadors, African American slaves, illegal immigrants (the decedents of the aforementioned Native American slaves, illegally [by modern international law] kicked out of this country) etc.|`|AA10546011	The US is now officially a socialist country.

Most municiple judges are practicing attorneys and are not always privy to codes of conduct.|`|SLfmBjkOaa	It's his court and he can act the way he wants as long as he doesn't break the law.

Don't forget that most Judges were lousy lawyers that decided to take on the mundane job of sitting on the bench.

On the other hand, the judge can demand strict adherence to a vague set of rules for everyone ELSE'S behaviour in the court.    Unless the judge broke any written laws, there is little anyone can do to him.  In HIS opinion, the clapping upon his return could be considered disrespectful to his court, and he, is the "judge" of that.    One may point out that this doesn't seem "fair," but, a courtroom is NOT a democracy.  There can only be one person in charge and, outside of what is specified by law, that one person makes the rules that everyone else has to follow.    By the end of that day's court session, SOMEONE is going to have to be heard last, and it is NOT the courtroom that decides the order of cases heard, nor the speed at which procedings move.    It is the judge.|`|QI74CxD0aa	I think it is terrible that a judge would act in such a manner.  The people who were appearing at traffic court appeared when they were told to do so.  They were a lot more respectful to the judge than he was to them.  Some judges forget that they are there to serve the public.  The position shouldn't be used for fits of temper or to show how easily he can punish people who are already at his mercy.

En sntesis, cada estado delega su soberana en un pacto multilateral con representantes plenipotenciarios.  Aqu es preciso recordar que Colombia es miembro fundador del acuerdo que se estableci en New York.  Como recordars el primer experimento fracas con la Liga de las Naciones al convertirse en un rgano inoperante que no pudo contener la I Guerra Mundial ni los sucesos que desencadenaron la II Guerra Mundial.  La estructura interna de la ONU es un sistema de rganos independientes que actan alrededor del mundo entre los estados miembros como UNICEF, ACNUR, FAO, etc algunos de ellos funcionan a la perfeccin y se hacen presentes en situaciones calamitosas como la FAO en las hambrunas de Africa Subsahariana, la ACNUR con los refugiados de nuestro pas y en Kosovo.  Por el contrario, el mayor problema de la ONU radica en el Consejo de Seguridad donde tienen asientos las grandes potencias como Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, Francia, Rusia y China que tienen la facultad de vetar decisiones trascendentales en materia de seguridad mundial, otros miembros elegidos por regiones tienen voz pero sin voto.  Otro problema es el poder interno de acuerdo a las cuotas de sostenimiento interno de toda la estructura de la ONU, algunos pases no tienen como pagar sus cuotas y por tanto no tienen poder de decisin o capacidad para nombrar funcionarios en la entidad.  Tambin es necesario considerar que el equilibrio de la representatividad mundial, el panorama de potencia militares con capacidad nuclear se ha ampliado con India, Pakistan, Israel, Corea del Norte, al igual que el tama?o de las economas, del territorio y la poblacin es vital en la toma de decisiones, no es lo mismo considerar la presin que puede ejercer Brasil frente a una decisin de Belice, o lo que China o Rusia puedan opinar en relacin con el Medio Oriente que lo que aporte Malawi o Lesotho.  Si bien es cierto que no es lo mas democrtico que pueda existir, al menos es el foro mundial donde se discuten problemas de nuestro tiempo y algunas veces encuentran solucin, de todas formas hay que replantear y reestructurar internamente a la ONU para que cumpla con sus objetivos.

The $30 billion airport expansion for O'Hare Field  has succeeded in forcing small entrepreneurs out of business.  It has also torn down homes and entire neighborhoods.  It has done nothing to show that it was or is a worthwhile venture for the state of Illinois.  His next list of unneeded expenses is the goddamned olympics in 2016.  But, Daley is only concerned about Daley, and to hell with the people of Illinois.    Daley cannot be trusted to hold the purse strings for Chicago.  He doesn't understand the needs of the common man.  He believes he has a destiny, and the more money you give him the more ways he will find to piss it away !    In my opinion, the most serious, unresolved issue about Obama is his place of birth.  The truth will come out someday, and it will be revealed that he was born in Kenya.  Justice Clarence Thomas was the only member of the supreme Court to favor an investigation on this matter.  The Chief Justice and the other lemmings fell into line, in favor of not taking the case.

The problem you see is that different states have different ranges/sentencing requirements.  And you can't tell each state how to sentence convicts.  Each state has to decide that on its own.

Since the only source of info is the Bible for most believers, real christians should at least read it.    Knowing that the bible itself prevents men to kill each other, if Bush was a real christian, he wouldn't have killed nearly a million innocent iraqis for their oil, nor 5000 of his own innocent american soldiers!!!

d6b221edff2d247c468406cc5d25944eaa	En Venezuela si no apoyas a Hugo Chavez (l ha dicho "el que no es conmigo contra mi es"), no tienes acceso a ninguno de los beneficios que ofrece el estado. Si alguna vez votaste en contra de algunas de sus proposiciones o en su contra en cualquiera de las tantas elecciones que ha hecho, entonces te tiene anotado en una base de datos (que por increible que parezca la venden los buhoneros en la calle en su formato para CD roam). Alli aparecen todos los datos sobre tu vida privada, incluyendo tu nombre, direccion, numero de cedula de identidad, y por quien o que votaste en cada una de las eleccioens que se han llevado a cabo en los ultimos 8 a?os. ?Que como pueden saber eso?. Esta claro que las maquinas electorales son manipuladas y le permiten saber al ente electoral y por lo tanto algobierno por quien votas. Nos persiguen, nos acosan, nos amenazan, es algo verdaderamente terrible. Hay otra parte de la poblacion que se siente atendida y beneficiada por el gobierno, ya que este le "regala"  una peque?a cantidad de dinero al final de cada mes (100$ aproximadamente). En los hospitales no hay alcohol ni algodones ni jeringas. En Venezuela son asesinadas a balazos un promedio 80 personas cada fin de semana. Nadie tiene derecho a quejarse a menos que que desee ser agredido por el presidente en sus acostumbradas cadenas precidenciales (Se nos tacha de carro?a, apatridas, escualidos, traidores a la patria y literalmente nos ha dicho que nos metamos nuestras quejas por el c u l o). Todo esto es cierto y si no etubiera grabado en multiples videos nadie nos lo creeria. Que puede hacer la comunidad internacional? Pues no seguirse haciendo la "loca" y mirar hacia otro lado solo por los jugoso contratos multimillonarios que tienen sus paise con el gobierno de Chavez. Pero es ingenuo pensar que la OEA o cualquier otro organismo hemisferico hara algo por nosotros. Los estudiantes estamos en la calle luchando por la autonomia de nuestras universidades y por la libertad de expresion, si es necesario, somos muchos los que estamos dispuestos a luchar hasta el final por ello. Gracias|`|49lPNOIhaa	Creo firmemente que el mejor apoyo que nos podran dar es del tipo informativo. Nosotros tenemos canales de televisin que mienten mucho, realmente muchos no sabemos en quin creer... a la oposicin ahora "slo les queda Globovisin" y a los chavistas, parece que "casi todo". Sin embargo, las personas que tenemos una visin ms objetiva de las cosas y que estamos al margen de cualquier fanatismo, no tenemos en quien creer. Por citar un ejemplo, estn los simblicos 11 y 13 de abril. Los medios de comunicacin lograron enga?ar a miles de personas y muchas piensan que el gobierno es culpable de alrededor de las 10 muertes que hubo el 11, sin embargo, gracias a un documental llamado "Claves de Una Masacre", en el que adems colaboraron periodistas extranjeros, YO en lo personal, me siento mucho ms informada, y S que la TV transmiti CENTENARES de mentiras... mentiras que en mi opinin le cost la concesin a la basura poco educativa de RCTV.    Por otro lado, por poner ejemplos ms recientes, hasta Globovisin estuvo mintiendo en cuanto a las protestas de toda esta semana, en la que los estudiantes salieron a exigir respeto a la autonoma de las universidades y a la libertad de expresin, ?no por RCTV!, y en GV transmitan "Periodistas y Estudiantes por RCTV"... que bolas...    Entonces, ?en quin nos queda creer? =/    Por eso, yo pienso que la mejor ayuda es la de carcter informativo, que no sea la cadena CNN en la que tampoco confo mucho por mucho renombre que tenga. No creo que importe en renombre, sino el contenido... los invito a ver el documental que cit ms arriba, en youtube. La resolucin no es la mejor, pero s se ve "la cosa", jejeje.

UvzKiis0aa	Yes, that and tax cuts for billionaires in a time of war.  This is the only time in US history when there was a tax cut during a war.  The Bush junta said that this war wouldn't last 6 months(Rumsfeld) and would pay for itself (Wolfowitz).  It was just another lie in the long list of lies from Bush.      As far as jobs for Americans, that war has been going on for many years and we are losing.  China became the power house in manufacturing because of their insistence that any product sold in China has at least 60% content Chinese made.  So companies had to move manufacturing to China, and set up Chinese suppliers.  These suppliers and companies started under cutting and dumping on the American market which has driven jobs out of the USA.      We need to start taxing and using tariffs against foreign made products.  We need to provide incentives for companies to keep jobs in the US market.  Stop all the companies bringing in H1B visa holders who are taking away middle class jobs and driving down salaries.  Stop all the businesses who hire illegals.  This has been an economic war and the traitors are the Republicans who are so deep in the pockets of multinationals, they don't care if Americans are out of jobs and living in the streets.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Republicans are the number one reason we have such a huge deficit.

EenbVs8Oaa	Talk Radio is much more interactive, with listeners calling in on a regular basis.  It therefor encourages thinking and doing, rather than just sitting back and feeling elite.

Arbuckle, yes, failed.  Do you think profitable companies declare bankruptcy?|`|ZTbgOgqgaa	The better question is, Why does Conservative Talk radio succeed?    And the answer is this:    Conservatives love to hear the SAME THINGS over and over and OVER AGAIN.    They'll listen to Rush Limbaugh repeat himself for 3 hours. Then they'll listen to Medved. Then the Weiner Nation. Then the next guy.     And they'll ALL repeat the exact same things.    So it's a smaller number of people, but they're listening all day. So the ratings look good. And that brings in the advertising dollars.    (This is also why FOX News has such good ratings. Conservatives will turn it on and NEVER TURN IT OFF.)
AA10317675	1 - Obama is NOT a Muslim.    2 - IF (just to humor you) Obama was a Muslim, he would be a moderate Muslim as demonstrated by the fact that he allows his women to walk around without head scarfs. and moderate Muslims do not usually participate in this barbaric act!    3 - The president has a lot of power, but not enough to unilaterally, without the support of the House & Senate, mandate anything like that.    4 - If he somehow managed to get around those constraints, I think very few doctors would be willing to do such a thing. And people would not just protest, but would take up arms agaisnt the government to prevent this from happening.    So - long story short - if you are really worried about this, you need to get mental help immediately!    -    And this action is NOT a 'circumcision!' A circumcission removes a very small part of the penis, just the foreskin. This barbaric act performed in Africa & the middle east it the complete removal of the clitoris!

We still have to go along with whatever idiot is in office right now. Some states allow you to recall your politicians if they screw up, but most states don't and the federal government does not.    For example, right now my governor just announced a plan to close schools and use the money to build prisons. He wants the state Congress to approve a committee to do this, but if the Congress disagrees, he'll just use the gubernatorial power to tell the State Dept. of Education to shut them down.    My state doesn't allow recalls. So, we're stuck with this, despite most people preferring local schools to local prisons.

Abor- tion has already toped that number and is riseing by 115,000 a day.  So if you think abortion is ok. Think again!|`|AhoIQkXAaa	I am against it. I think it is morally wrong and causes physical stress to the mother (and obviously her baby) and emotional stress. She will have it on her heart for the rest of her life that SHE KILLED AN INNOCENT HUMAN BEING.     BUT... I think it should be legal. If for no other reason than IF it is done, it should be done in a safe, hospital setting. Not in some place where it is done underground.I don't think that legality plays any roll in making women want abortions. Any sensible, unselfish woman would want her baby to live, and that's that.
lf5NEDuYaa	I would contact the post office.. The fact that your out going mail is still still sitting in your mailbox is BS.

I would take the note to the local post master and ask.    Has it occured to you that it could of been someone other than a mailman who posted the note?

It usually IS required that a name be on each mailbox but is is NOT required that it be on the OUTSIDE of the mailbox.  As long as the letter carrier can see the name while the mailbox is opened you are covered.|`|HeoS75kGaa	Everyone else has said the same thing, and I'm just repeating what they've said.  There is no law of any kind requiring your name on your mailbox.  Additionally, there is no USPS regulation that requires your name to be on your mailbox.  The letter is addressed to an apartment number and it must be delivered to the mailbox for that apartment number.  To return that mail to sender is willful misdirection of the mail and the carrier can be punished for it.    If there is no apt  on the letter's address, the carrier might have an excuse but that's a rare situation.  For the carrier to refuse to pick up properly stamped and addressed outgoing mail from your mailbox, again he's violating Postal regulations and he again can be punished for failure to perform his job.    In either case, or both, punishment can lead to dismissal from his job at the authority of the postmaster for your district.  File a complaint.

That's one of the reason's so many states are almost bankrupt. States differ so much in what social programs they need and rarely pay attention to social issues anyway. Who cares about the people? No one seems to but the new administration. I think states should be limited to decide small things only and the government rule the country, like most governments do everywhere.

Quebracho, cuyo nombre oficial es Movimiento Patritico Revolucionario Quebracho (MPR Quebracho), es partido poltico que se reivindica como un movimiento revolucionario argentino. Segn sus propios materiales de difusin se definen de la siguiente manera: "una organizacin poltica que lucha por la liberacin nacional y social de nuestra Patria. Por un pas socialmente justo, econmicamente independiente y polticamente soberano. Por la Revolucin Nacional Antiimperialista". Si bien Quebracho propone un ideario de izquierda, promoviendo la abolicin de la propiedad privada, la igualdad, la disminucin de la pobreza y la gestin popular de la justicia y la poltica, sus tcticas de accin, que incluyen la provocacin, el enfrentamiento con la polica y el ataque a instituciones pblicas y privadas, no le han hecho fcil mantener buenas relaciones con otras organizaciones de izquierda, y no est englobado en ninguna de las formaciones polticas de ese lado del espectro. Sin embargo, y precisamente por esas tcticas, es una de las organizaciones radicales ms conocidas de Argentina. Como parte de su estrategia de confrontacin hacia Estados Unidos, ha manifestado su apoyo al gobierno de Mahmud Ahmadineyad y de Fidel Castro, y emplea frecuentemente la imagen del Che Guevara como identificacin en carteles con los colores celeste y blanco con estrellas rojas.|`|697291356809d1e74fe9bff0e5c42a15aa	la mitad son servicios|`|7238c6a46c001775f5cc1526603b771daa	La faccion extrema de la izquierda argentina, por supuesto, bancada por nuestro presidente.|`|65033bb625dbc28a9b45f425d2a5d5abaa	Son estupidos,que se sienten importantes con una capucha y un palo.si de mi dependiera los mataria.como atodos los delincuentes que andan sueltos,y aumentan por la falta de leyes y prevencion.son como una enfermedad si no se las trata o cura avanzan y crecen.obviamente.|`|hGi0P12saa	una manga de vagos, desocupados, guarecidos en los inmuebles de los DDHH, bancados por los cuervos de los DDHH, delincuentes con la cara tapada, ratas cobardes tapados, que el dia que se corran los enrejados van a salir corriendo y hasta el kalafate no paran.|`|kgoTiKeoaa	simples delincuentes prontuariados bancados por el sistema K para romper una Capital que a l no le importa.|`|e1575d8bd18dfbcb0eb60e61247c9dd6aa	Conjunto de delincuentes pagos por la SIDE para sembrar el caos, el miedo y destrozar todo lo que encuentran a su paso.

Garr viaj recientemente a Chile y demostr su absoluto desconocimiento de aquel pas al criticar duramente al fallecido dictador Pinochet y a los referentes de la poltica trasandina, por haberle brindado funerales de estado.    Las declaraciones de la ministra argentina de Defensa, Nilda Garr, sobre el comportamiento que tuvo el Ejrcito chileno durante el velatorio y exequias de su ex comandante en jefe y ex Presidente de la Repblica, general Augusto Pinochet fueron criticadas hoy en Chile.    El presidente de la Comisin de Defensa de Cmara de Diputados, Patricio Hales, dijo al diario La Segunda": No me gusta que desde Argentina se enjuicie la condicin poltica chilena, aunque evidentemente el juicio de la figura de Pinochet ha sido parte de la opinin pblica mundial, pero no acepto estos consejeros como de la ministra argentina".    "No nos pueden juzgar, menos quienes en materia de derechos humanos tienen una tremenda viga en el ojo para mirarnos la paja en el nuestro".  Dijo Hales que si la ministra Garr quiere dar consejos para que se aplique esa ley de punto final en Chile mejor que se guarde el consejo".  Para Alfonso Vargas, diputado opositor y miembro de la misma comisin, las declaraciones de Garr son absolutamente inadecuadas" y a?adi que no corresponde que una ministra de otro pas opine sobre materias internas de Chile.  Vargas agreg que es necesario reclamar al Gobierno argentino por las declaraciones de la ministra Garr y que nos den una explicacin".    A Jorge Tarud, diputado, no le sorprenden las declaraciones de la ministra argentina, pues ya lo hizo en cuanto al tema martimo entre Chile y Bolivia."Hay que hacerle ver al Gobierno argentino que ya est bueno que (Garr) se deje de ser opinloga. Si ella sigue hablando, se podran da?ar las buenas relaciones que deben existir entre ambas naciones", afirm Tarud.    Para el senador Juan Antonio Coloma, las palabras de Garr son "una provocacin a Chile, porque entre los pases es bsico el principio de no intervencin".  "La forma grosera en que la ministra de defensa se inmiscuye en los asuntos chilenos refleja que hay un afn imperialista por parte de algunos argentinos que sienten que tienen todo el derecho a entrometerse en lo que no les corresponde", dijo Coloma.    Nilda Garr no slo fue cuestionada por la oposicin poltica argentina en el momento de su nombramiento al frente de Defensa -dado que su pasado poltico tiene estrecha relacin con la subversin en los a?os 70- amante de Abal Medina,    sino que, puertas adentro, SU ALCOHOLISMO ES VOX POPULI.     Se han criticado con dureza las decisiones de la Ministra que contribuyeron a la casi desaparicin de los servicios de inteligencia de las fuerzas armadas en la Argentina, con la sola intencin de satisfacer los deseos de grupos de autodenominados "derechos humanos".

S51x5vK3aa	On 8th May, 1949 was declared the independence of Germany. The first German government was elected 14th August, 1949 and started 15th September, 1949. But that was only in West Germany. The Saarland region was occupied by France since November 1946 and was reunificated by referendum on 1st January, 1957 with the Federal Republic of Germany.    Eastern Germany (DDR, German Democratic Republic) declared independence in March 1948, but was until his reunification with the rest of Germany 1991 practically under Soviet control and not a sovereign state.|`|AA10268618	We occupied southern Germany for like 2 years I think|`|dcb90df181b3fcfb78e9c229cd2eeb15aa	Who cares? **** germany & germans ok|`|H6t8YxGYaa	Trully not till after the berlin wall came down did all of Germany come into some kind of self governance.

The only good thing about this bill is if it gets passed, it will likely cost Pelosi and perhaps Reid their jobs.

Either way it cuts down on the operating money the government has.    Congressmen need to do what is right for all the people.  Not just the richest bastards in their districts.    The poor voted you in, not the rich.  Where I live,  5% rich. $150k a year plus  16% middle class  3% unable to vote. (Felon, Illegal, etc.)  76% poor earn $25k a year or less.    Fix congressman and Senators.  They are the Purveyors of Pork.  Not the President.
4b28c8d6c4701c9b0210498b25f2c3faaa	There are studies that probably are more accurate than opinions to determine if a person serving prison time will commit another crime, but I feel they are very likely to commit another crime because prisons are violent, hate filled and racist societies where you either get with the program or become a victim of that society.    A person can be rehabilitated in prison but they will never be the same and are likely to hold racist attitudes when they are sent back into society.    U.S. prisons can be more effective by never housing non-violent offenders in the same institutions as violent offenders.    My prison would be an institution that focuses on punishment first, then education, so that when they got out of prison they would be better prepared to function in society and definitely would not want to make a return visit.
l02Huqdlaa	Wow, way to much baggage in this. One thing she can't do is take the kids out of the country without her husbands consent. She claims he was abusive which is what women claim all the time to justify their leaving and it makes me wonder cause she hasn't tried to divorce him before this cause of the bank account. How is it she still has or had access if their relationship was that bad? Why didn't she just drain it or why didn't he? I sure would have as wrong as that would be but if he was 'abusive' and I had kids I wouldn't think twice about it. I think you two should slow down a bit and get her life straightened out with a divorce and BE SURE YOU CAN LEGALLY TAKE THE KIDS OUT OF THE COUNTRY before you do anything. Then, then proceed. If the husband is unwilling you may have to take some of that money for legal advice.
AA11592327	If we truly had free market capitalism, government would not be bailing out banks, insurance companies and the auto makers. Free market capitalism in America is dead.
UZBULUuraa	Hatred is indeed rampant both in the white and black communities because hatred is taught in the homes and will always be present . Jeremiah Wright who was Obama's pastor preached black racism from the pulpit which is something Dr. King did not do. Many black leaders of today are so far from Dr. King's teachings that they don't want harmony with other races. Dr. King might be pleased with Obama, but he would not be pleased to see racism in the black community as well as the white community because he did preach unity.|`|lXgCj1RJaa	There will always be "racism" because it is hardwired into our genes; we fear that which is different because, for our caveman ancestors, the different was the enemy. But we aren't cavemen. We are, hopefully, civilised (or at least proto-civilised). An inclusive society embraces all of its members. The problem with that is that somewhere the society has a boundary, and beyond that boundary is something else, something different, something that our caveman brain regards as the enemy. Even if you push the boundary to global limits, that caveman will still be there, waiting for the first alien to land on Earth so that we can all heap our hate on him. If everyone is the same, all -isms disappear (racism, sexism, ageism, etc) but what a dull and boring world that would be. Only by learning to regard the different as our friend can we ever eliminate the negative aspect of racism. The trouble is, I'm not sure that as a race we can do that. (PS Yes, things have changed since MLK, and mostly for the better, but it's a work in progress and, if I'm right, always will be.)|`|Souvww0maa	I will bet $20 that you were calling to stop the hate during the Bush Administration.

People's dislike for Obama is mainly ideological - not race based.|`|RZfoszJFaa	I think the last thing people are unhappy with is his race.|`|kHx1upOpaa	Some people believe in white supremacy whether they say it or not. Why do you think people are clinging to his white bloodlines when mixed people have always been considered black. Why do some people think they can tell what others what to refer to themselves as?|`|0YVDXvBOaa	Yes it is. More failed social programs these days. More inner city crime, more single mothers, more blacks in prison, more illegitimate children, lowest percentage of high school graduates / highest percentage of drop outs. So yes, things have changed, certainly not for the better. MLK would certainly be proud of Obama, but not the black community.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I don't think many people hate Obama due to race, although according to the Secret Service there have been more threats on him then previous candidates, but I think that is the result of extremists like the KKK that unfortunately we'll always have.  The biggest difference between now and 1968 is that Obama was not only nominated, but elected, what are the chances that the GOP or Democratic Party of 1968 even considers a presidential candidate who isn't a white male?|`|asGVrqhEaa	Ya, people are still racist that's only cause people aren't African Americans and they don't know or understand what Freedom is. You still should not be ashamed to be an american. You should be ashamed of the people who say the "n". I am Cuban and I did not want Obama to win. But hey God does stuff for a reason right? It's gonna be ok. People HAVE to change some day.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	Yes, I do believe it is.  I don't think we could have elected a biracial President if things haven't changed.  There is still racism, for sure, but not like it was back then.  People on this site are blow hards and they feel safe ranting here anonymously.|`|wNcTEADJaa	hatred will always be around no matter the color of your skin or your faith.  take a history class and you'll see things HAVE changed and maybe you'll learn a bit more about the USA and find a way to be proud.|`|ALyHiGGgaa	everthing is very differnt! and you got some real problems !!!|`|zlmnfFpYaa	You want to see real racism?  Take your lily white self-loathing posterior down to Compton and stroll through the 'hood.  They'll show you what racism is all about.    The only thing keeping the black man down today are other black men.  They have the same opportunities, more perhaps, than any other demographic group in the country.  All they have to do is use the avenues at their disposal.

Yes, there is frustration anger guilt and many other things in there as well.    Although I know there  are some out there, I have never met anyone who regretted having children.  I have met many who regretted NOT having children.    On a house and mortgage and stuff.  Its part of life.  Who said its all easy?  Who would really want everything to be easy?  IF every thing was easy it would take a great deal of joy out of life.  The joy of beating the problems set before you.  The joy of rising above everything to achieve your goals...    The AMERICAN DREAM.  The American dream is whatever you want it to be.  That is what it means to be free.  I am quite sure your dream swill not be the same as mine.  Yes we could have similar dreams, but as unique individuals our dreams will vary as well.  Create your own dream and then seek to live it.    Some advice.  Slow down don't go so fast with planning your life.  Set some basic goals and live your live toward those goals.  Take what comes at you and make the best of it.    If you don't figure out how to just live and enjoy your life, things will NOT be better when you hit your 40's.      Good luck.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	This is the only advice I can give you:   Don't buy a home. --It is a total scam run by the banks and government--If you mortgage a home, the bank owns it, if you don't pay your taxes, the real owners come and confiscate what you thought was your "property".  Equity in a home is banking hogwash,  if you foreclose, you lose every penny you ever put into it.  If you DO buy a home, make sure you buy ULTRA low, preferably when the housing markets are in the crapper, better if in an economic crisis: Like right now for instance.    This is a GREAT time to buy a huge home (if you have the cash), preferably one that has been repossessed by the bank and not one that's trying desperatly to be resold by the original buyer,   just make sure it's valuable property and you get a very low rate for it, (making sure your credit is good by that time--but again, the government taps into valuable property  --the government recognizes the property that matters and charges you twice to three time or even five times the price everyone else pays who are on worthless land (but they also have to pay overinflated property taxes as well, as it is).  It comes down to buy low and sell high.  If you know how to gamble and play the game, it's the only time home buying is profitable at all.    Make sure you are certain about the person you eventually marry.  Make sure he is a stable person emotionally and has something going for him for a financially stable future.   I don't blame you about worrying about having children.  Worry about that when the time comes, don't get too ahead of yourself.    It's good that you are questioning the american myth (dream).    This is the most appropriate time to do it as we are losing our economy, our sovereignty, and becoming a financially, morally and spiritually bankrupted country more and more every year.    There may be a very bleak future indeed for young people--never mind our children or their children.    One thing we know for certain:  This social experiment of consumerism is recent and not self sustaining and it thrives off of limited resources.    Watch this and become informed.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLBE5QAYX...|`|meisgiZBaa	suck it up, buttercup. at least you have the chance to have an education, choose who or if you want to marry and whether or not you want to have kids, aren't dying of illness, are in a developed part of the world, and can read and write.     the purpose of life is to keep on truckin, and to make the most out of it. so stop having a mid life crisis at 24 years old and count your blessings.

No respect, no appreciation to parents & when we need them  ( we come to this situation of need because of them) they just show their backs.     Be practical, live your life & as I feel exactly like you (I am a bit older-MALE- & experienced having two daughters) and contact me , don't think of having those devils (children).

"When will I be happy?"  You'll be happy just as soon as you decide to be happy.  If you want to be happy, be grateful for what you have today--right now.  Surely you have something to be happy about?  Health, family, friends, country, anything?    My dad is one of those people who always have a smile on their faces.  Of course he's had tough times but he's always so grateful for everything.  Especially the little things.  Being able to hear.  Being able to smell.  Being independent.  Having something to eat.  A kind word from someone.  Sure, he could sit around and feel sorry for himself and all of the things he doesn't have.  He could choose to concentrate on the negatives like the fact that he's been blind since he was 7 years old, his only son passed away 10 years ago, his only daughter lives 600 miles away, etc.  But he doesn't.  He doesn't see the point in it.  He makes it a point to enjoy every day and every minute that he can.    That does seem to be the key.  Happiness isn't a destination but the journey.  What do you think about concentrating more on enjoying the daily journey than what will supposedly happen when you get there?|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	This doesn't really belong in politics.

People run background checks on others for different reasons, and some don't check local law enforcement arrest records.  If they do though, they will find your boyfriends record of arrest, and the charges on which he was arrested.|`|VyLXMBtcaa	No but it will get you in the end. Read the fine print in the contract.
C7FtRe69aa	An honorable Sarah Palin might be a good president. Have you seen one?    Actually, considering her fanatical views (supporting the dissolution of the United States, witch burning, and speaking in tongues), her lack of integrity both with her behavior in office and her lies on the campaign trail, adding in her lack of experience and her political views with are out-of-touch of everyone not in the Republican party, and most of those in the Republican party, I don't think she would be my first choice.    Evidently, most Americans agree with me since it appears that she probably cost McCain the election. Not that McCain was such a hot choice, but he might have had a chance.|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	disagree.|`|AA10546011	I think she has great potential and should be ready by 2012.

She campaigned for vice president against these sorts of things, but has a history of supporting this waste and corruption so no I don't want the GOP to be more like Palin.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	She has two brains.|`|aXSjRwEVaa	Disagree.  Abuse of power or not, she is still unqualified and has political views that would erode the progress this country has made over the past decades.

She makes women pay for their own rape kits because they come with a morning after pill. She thinks preserving a zygote that may or may not exist is more important than finding a rapist.    She's an ignorant, selfish idiot. She used tax payer dollars to fly her family around to church events. She shows off her kids to the media and gets angry when their names pop up anywhere. She supports pro-abstinence sex education, and her daughter got knocked up at 17, proving her methods wrong. The mother of her future son-in-law is a meth dealer. In fact, Wascilla is the meth capitol of Alaska.      Disagree. Very, very much.     I'm a Democrat, and female.    EDIT: Tina Fey said that "I can see Alaska from my house!" line, because in an interview with Katie Courrick, she said she has foreign policy experience because Alaska is near Russia. And no, I would not vote for Tina Fey as a politician because her only experience is in comedy, and she has never been politically involved.|`|AA10071149	Disagree, American Independent.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	The first report was authorized nearly a month before she was named McCain's running mate and by a legislative panel that was mostly republican.

AA11494150	Releasing the contents of a medical record without permission is a violation of HIPPA laws. However, just confirming she was in the hospital is not a violation.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	The doctor or nurse can certainly say you were present at the hospital at such and such time and date without violating anyone's confidence.     My guess is unless it was a very small and not busy emergency room (is there such a thing?) they are going to have better things to do and even if they agree, it is not going to happen in a timely enough manner to help.    Bigger issue to me, is why was your relationship with the teacher so bad before this incident that she doesn't believe you? Maybe you can ask her how you can rebuild the trust you used to have with her, because I think there is a lot more to this story then you are letting on.|`|42910e399cf1ff7bf1eb16843000fb5eaa	It's not illegal as long as your grandma consents to them giving you the information|`|lf5NEDuYaa	Just let your teacher call to verify? it is not illegal and your teacher is not anyone.. Are you telling the truth? if not then it is no big deal to let her call.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	Was your grandmother released from the emergency room? Usually they would give her a piece of paper with care instructions on it if she was. You could probably just copy that and give it to your teacher.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Depends on how much they give out.    A doctors note saying they saw patient X on given day at given time is not a violation.        A note saying they saw her and treated her for xyz,  however,  is.
AA11163314	When you entered your information into e-qip you were specifically asked if you had ever been fired from a job.      If you failed to answer this question honestly then you can expect the fact that you were fired for falsification of documents to be given more weight in the eyes of an adjudicator.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	First, you need to amend your form. But they will dig and they find anything that you weren't honest about.  Once they are done, you will be called in to explain any issues that need clarifying.  Tell the whole truth.  It's much worse to lie.  Then they will make their recommendation.    Being fired and "job ended" are not the same thing.  Just say you got fired.  And lying by omission is still lying.  Come clean and take your chances.|`|WseLyvSpaa	The most interesting thing to the investigators will probably be your private life and financial status:  Folks with lots of debt are prone to bribery and extortion. They may not care much about your past jobs.  BUT, if they question your old boss, it may leave a bad impression. Do not lie on the application for security clearance.  They do not like it when you hide stuff.  That's kind of the whole point.  You must be honest. They want to see if you can be trusted.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	If you  lied on your job application then that can be grounds for immediate termination.    If you lied on your Security Clearance Application, that's a violation of US Code and could get you into serious trouble if they wanted to press it or as a minimum deny your clearance. I hope you said you were terminated and why. The missing address information is minor in comparison.

AA12332649	Thbe PBJ program is like that of many other states; it is a deferred judgment.  This means that you serve your probation and then after your probation, the judge will dismiss the case.    You should be aware that your criminal record also contains any information relating to a criminal court of law.  Even if you are found not guilty, a record of the offense will still come up on background checks    What you need to do is serve out the remainder of your probation, then petition the court to expunge your record.  Ask your probation officer for a letter stating successful completion of PBJ.  You can hire an attorney for your expungement petition, but it would cost you a couple hundred extra, and your offense would not necessarily prompt the district attorney to contest your petition.    Go down to court and ask for the court room that hears petitions to expunge.  Ask what the petition must contain and prepare it well ahead of time.  In most states, the petition must contain quite a bit of technical information such as your case number, photo number, fbi number etc.  You can ask the court to provide this info to you.    As far as your employment is concerned, you may consider speaking to representatives of your state who handle employment discrimination.  It is illegal to base an employment decision on an arrest because of the presumption of innocence.  The PBJ, or ARD, or Deferred judgment programs of various states are treated differently under employment law, but your state human relations and equal opportunity offices would know how they are treated or they could find out.  You have to make the decision as to whether it is worth it, either in a lawsuit and/or a petition for unemployment charged against your former employer.

She is doing a good job of governing Alaska but has a long way to go before she could be prepared to be VP or President, in my opinion.      It does amaze me how "evil" she has been portrayed by her views on her environmental issues.  And, her pro-life position has garnered hate by the pro-choice crowd.

If she would have been left alone and continued on the pace she had set I think she would have been much more viable.

aBJDqwq6aa	You can contact the agency that has jurisdiction and insist they exercise the warrant.  Usually bench warrants result in arrest when the person named in the warrant is arrested during traffic stops or when in court for other offenses.  Private investigators have no legal authority to arrest anyone.  Local police departments do not usually seek out individuals on a regular basis. Usually, a Federal or State grant supplies money to local agencies that pays for the manpower to conduct 'warrant sweeps'.

However, under California law, hearsay is admissible if the person testifying to the hearsay is a police officer with a certain amount of experience or training.  Because of that, civilian witnesses are often excused from the hearing by the prosecutor, and the officer to took that person's statement testifies instead.  As to discrediting witnesses you should leave that up to your attorney (and if you are charged with a felony, you should have an attorney).|`|AA10599026	A citizen arrested you? Then yes, she would have to show up. Or was she just a witness who called the police on you? That changes things.    Her criminal record might help you question her impartiality, but she would have to have a really bad record and it would have to be a crime that directly affects her credibility and shows that she has a history of lying. You would have to file requests with the court to even bring it up, so I would get a lawyer.|`|D6kwriPxaa	If they are the witness, yes they would have to show up.  Are you guilty?|`|CowgOqXTaa	All that the State has to do at the prelim is satisfy the court that there is a case to answer. The case is not tried at the prelim, and testimony is not usually offered.    To get the case dismissed at prelim you have to be able to show that even IF everything she says is true, there would still be no case against you. Her credibility is, therefore, not an issue.    Now, at trial, her credibility becomes an issue. You don't 'file motions' to discredit her - your lawyer, when cross-examining her, will ask her about her criminal history and try to persuade the jury that that history makes her less credible.

GNX9bQUWaa	In Oklahoma the statute of limitation on enforcement of a written contract is five (5) years and for a non-written contract is three (3) years, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, Section 95 (2008).    Whether you can apply Ohio law is first going to depend on whether the contract specifies the law that governs and second on whether Ohio has the authority to apply its own law to the contract.  I do not know the contents of the contract and do not have a familiarity of Ohio law.  However, Oklahoma law does have provisions to apply Oklahoma law to contracts executed out of state.  See: Okla.

We keep asking the government to "protect" us, then we get angry when we figure out that the government is taking everything from us.  Well duh.    Those items have NOTHING to do with your daughter's job.  Her job is to go to school and be educated.  It does not require electronic toys.    Try this.  Either stop asking the government to "protect" us, or learn how to obey the rules the government creates.  You can't have it both ways.    My kids are taught to obey the law and rules, no matter how much they disagree with them.  If you want it to change, then go about legal methods to illicit change.

As long as you are angry, you cannot resolve this, and may make things much worse.  You were "wronged", but only a little.  The school may have to pay you $30.  That's it.  Insist they pay.  When they do not, file a claim in small claims court.  Small claims is designed to be easy, with no lawyers involved.  You will almost certainly get your money back, unless there are other things going on in the story that you may not know or you didn't tell us.  Since the policy is to return the confiscated items, the dean acted contrary to policy, and you win. Now, IMO, the reason the policy is to return the items is because to do otherwise constitutes theft.  A seriously crazy person might pursue petty theft charges against the dean, but you would need more evidence than you have.    Keep us all updated on how this goes.    added: The handbook is basically a contract between the school and the rest of the world.  If they acted contrary to the handbook, they lose. But they only lose $30.  Don't get to worked up about it, but do insist.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	No,they cannot throw anybodies   Private Property in the Trash...

It is up to You the Parent to be a Parent...  Both you and your Daughter knew that they  were not allowed...  But you wanting to be a Friend with your  Daughter instead of a Parent said OK.    There in lies the problem with so called  Parents today...they have failed as a Mother   and Parent in having the inability to say NO.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	It wasn't an idiotic rule. That stuff is a distraction and pointless to have in school for many reasons.    That said, I don't think they have a legal right to dispose of the headphones.

e1c7a6271ad6e2c76bcc9db56e32540baa	1.  Your 60 day notice is the beginning of the eviction proceeding.  When you're still there after 60 days they will file an unlawful detainer complaint.  At least in CA you can counter an eviction with an affirmative defense of "retaliatory eviction."  It would likely apply here.  that is - if you want to fight some where you really probably do not want to stay.    You do not have to pay expenses you did not agree to.  generally, when you are in a lease and the lease expires and it goes month to month, you can argue the terms of the original lease still apply.  Meaning, if you did not have to pay those fees then, don't have to now.  Also, it would be considered a change in your rental price - which requires at least thirty days' notice ( all by CA statute)|`|LzPhdri5aa	The biggest rule in court is he who has the best written documentation or justification wins.    You have no signed lease.  You're probably hosed.  But you might talk to a lawyer, because if they're cutting corners they might be vulnerable in some ways.

Allow me to respectfully suggest that perhaps the rehabilitative facility might just be what you need.

dJnRFpWWaa	If your friend's father owned the home by himself at the time of his death, then its subsequent ownership would be determined by reference to the father's Last Will and Testament. If the father died intestate, meaning he died without a Last Will and Testament, then ownership would be determined by reference to the laws of the state in which the father died.     In most cases that means the decedent's surviving spouse, if any, and his children, and/or the children of any deceased child, inherit everything in unequal shares. The surviving spouse usually takes a one-third interest and the children/grandchildren split the remaining two-thirds equally.    Your friend's uncle would have no legal right to convey the home to a church if he was not the owner of the property. If he had an ownership interest, then a title examination would disclose that fact. I assume your friend's attorney has done that, or will do that before the court  hearing. Since your friend is not an expert in this regard, he needs a title examination to prove to the court that the brother had no right to convey the property and that the church does not have good title to the same.    If you suspect that your friend's uncle conspired with someone at the church who has agreed to sell the home and kick back some of the sale proceeds to the uncle, then your friend should contact the state's Attorney-General and ask them to investigate the circumstances by which the church acquired title to the home and the proposed auction.    I hope your friend has retained an attorney with experience in real estate and the administration of estates. i suspect that he or she will ask the Court to enjoin the church's proposed auction of the home until its legal ownership can be determined by the court. But it is very important to demonstrate to the Court that you have a compelling case and that you will be irreparably harmed if the home is sold.    Please ensure that your friend is represented by a competent attorney who has had prior success in obtaining temporary restraining orders and other temporary/permanent injunctive relief.

If the state issuing the warrant has a cross state warrant, she can be picked up anywhere.    She will most likely have to go into court to justify establishing child support and when she does they will be able to pick her up.     She should call the court that has the warrant out on her and try to work it out with them.  If it is something minor she is in trouble for, they will probably be very flexible.

When we were a nation of 85% smokers, smokers had all the rights, they could smoke everywhere, etc.  Now that we're down to 7 or 8% smokers, non-smokers are just fine with smokers paying higher taxes.  You could say it was unfair, and maybe you'd be right, but you could also see it as the shoe being on the other foot.    Also, 400,000 people a year die from smoking, or used to.  If you are overweight, it can contribute to your early death in a number of ways, most of them indirect.  For instance, if you die of cancer or heart disease, well skinny people die of those things too, so it's not clear that it was your overweight condition that did you in.  But when people die from emphysema or lung cancer, it's pretty clear it was smoking that did it.  So it's easier to count the number of people who are killed by smoking, not as easy to count those killed by overweight (though we know many are).    Also, you can avoid tobacco altogether.  But even think people have to eat, so we can't just put a tax on food for -everyone-.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Its the old notion of a "sin" tax.  Most people don't smoke and smoking is out of favor so levying a tax on smokers will be a popular with most people.    I say people should be charged for insurance according to their relative risk.  That's what happens with people who are obese, elderly, or at risk for particular health problems.  Smokers fall into a high risk category.|`|X81oLqMtaa	The only reason why obesity is now costing more than smoking is that so many millions of smokers have died already.    As for the cost, smokers who rely on medicare cost US taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually for their care.    I agree obesity is an issue as well.  Maybe a $0.65 tax on each item is a good idea.    There is nothing wrong with sin taxes, when everyone else has to pay the costs to cover the few.|`|ljmE8eLLaa	When they can't get enough money from smokers, they will go after sneaker wearers and bubblegum chewers. The liberal's lust for OPM is never satisfied.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Very simple: there is an amount and type of food which can be consumed safely and healthily.  Yes, even junk food,  It is only when food is consumed in excess that health issues come about.    With tobacco, on the other hand, there is NO lower limit below which smoking is healthy.  Any use shortens life expectancy and causes cost to the health system.    By the way, I'd like to see the statistical data you used to determine that weight is the biggest cost to the health system.  I do not believe you are correct on that.

f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	There is a difference between a crime and a tort.   Criminals are charged with crime.  Civil wrongs are called torts.  It you called someone a liar and it was a lie, you would have slandered the person which is  a civil wrong.   He could sue you for monetary damages, but he can't put you in jail.  If it was the truth, he has no case.   The truth is an affirmative defense to slander.    Hope this helps|`|AA10206116	It is a civil matter. Someone cannot go to jail because they were spreading rumors.|`|AA10599026	Civil court is people suing other people, and it's usually for money or to make someone stop doing something (like PETA suing Ringling Brothers to make them stop treating animals a certain way). Criminal court is when you break a criminal law and the state (i.e. police and prosecutors) arrest, detain, and prosecute you. Some criminal laws are also civil laws, so sometimes they overlap.    There are examples of crimes that are also civil wrongs. For example, the state prosecuted OJ Simpson for murder, and later the families of the people he allegedly killed sued him for wrongful death.     The example you gave is of slander, which is a civil wrong but not a crime, so in that example, you could not be charged with anything.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Many crimes are also the basis for civil suits.  If you beat me up, I'll press charges and have you arrested.  You will face criminal charges.  But, I'll also sue you for my medical costs and my pain and suffering in civil court.  If you kill my mother, you'll be prosecuted for murder and I'll sue you for wrongful death.    However, many civil cases have no criminal component.  If I fail to pay my credit card debt, the credit card company can sue me for the money but they can't have me arrested for failure to pay.

SHKhqBPtaa	Speaking as a little girl that was molested by my step father and raped by my brother-in-law by the time I was 10 years old.  It is hard to deal with such.  My step father got 13 months in prison for it.  My brother-in-law didn't spend a minute in jail.  I am now 30 years old.  I have 4 kids of my own.  God forbid anyone do anything to my kids, I am a law officer, and I probably would take the "law" into my own hands.  I believe the people that do it really do have a mental disorder.  I think there is no cure, extermination would be the only cure.  I know, all criminals have rights.  I understand that, but what about the rights of the victim?  I have lived with the fact that 2 men molested and raped me starting at 5 years old, through 13.  My ex-husband raped me as well, after I was grown.  This is not something that goes away.  If I have to deal with it, why don't the sorry SOB that did it have to be punished forever?  There is not a day that goes by that it does not come up.  I am doing better now, but am a manic depressant because of it.  I am treated for that.  Does it help?  Not really, knowing that 2 of them are still alive and able to do what they want to others.  My step father died a few years ago.  It was not from natural causes.  He was murdered.  Why?  Molesting the wrong little girls.  Does it bother me?  Not really.  Why would it?

The standards that must be met are up to State law.  Typically any living parent or legal guardian must concur with the emancipation request though the courts in some states have the power to overrule a parental objection.  On the other hand, not all states permit the emancipation of minors within their jurisdiction.    As long as you are under 18, your parents have the right to control and limit your actions without your consent to the extent that their limitations are not directly harmful to you.  That would include barring the father of your child from their home or prohibiting him from having any contact with you or the child.  Until you are of legal age and able to make parental decisions yourself, your parents authority and control would generally extend to your child as well.    At age 17, you have less than a year to go until you are legally an adult.  It could conceivably take that long to secure an emancipation decree from a court of law.  Just tough it out until you turn 18 and then you can call the shots yourself.    The only issue I would suggest that you fight right now is mother's desire for you to drop out of school.  That is NEVER a good idea! Stay focused on completing your education first; there will be plenty of time to "play house" with your boyfriend once you turn 18 and can move out on your own without the consent of your parent(s).|`|z88IMXNFaa	Not all states permit emancipation and the states that do all have different rules.

HeoS75kGaa	First, both charges are criminal offenses, so it's not about who wins which one.  It's up to the prosecutor to decide which, or both, to follow through on.  In court, you'll probably be chewed out by the judge for engaging in nuisance behavior.    If it's behavior that has been pre-existing, everyone will get chewed out for it.  But it also establishes a certain 'acceptance' of such behavior.    With or without the pre-existing behavior, there is no excuse for assault and battery to the extent that it caused severe injury.  As for their counter-charge, there is insufficient evidence to show intent on your part to cause injury to the other kid.  The intent was to be a nuisance.    If your parents follow through, what's likely to happen is that the other kid will be found guilty, put on probation, probably assigned to some community service, and maybe ordered to attend anger management counseling.  The judge may order restitution of your medical expenses, but I doubt it.  Still, your parents would be wise to have all receipts and documentation to prove their losses.  You will be lectured or warned not to do the stunt with the tack again.    With that result, your parents can then sue the other parents for recovery of medical expenses, which will be an entirely different court procedure.  And then their homeowners insurance will pay it, minus the deductible.  So if your medical bills are less than $500, it would probably be cheaper for them to just pay it in the beginning.|`|PtzcEh5Caa	when your parents go to court, you would probably see a lot of talking back and explaining.     i thiink you might have a better end. i mean, the guy beat you up... because of a silly tack.|`|z88IMXNFaa	You are both going to get whacked by the judge.

Qou0CLwiaa	don;t know about the UK, but in the US (I expect UK is similar):    It is not illegal to view porn under 18, but it is illegal to distribute it to people under 18. See the difference? if you can get it, it is not your problem.     Even this may not be true anymore soon as there was a precedent setting ruling last week (but I think it may have been stayed pending additional appeals)    Making porn is not illegal before the age of 18. Actors can't be such     an age that the porn would fall afoul of  child porn laws of course, but if  you are under 18 but can find a way to produce porn with older folks, then go for it.    Of course the older folks might have concerns about their participation, not because it is porn but because of various corruption of minors charges and that sort of thing.    But if you are writing a story about adults that is explicit and no one else is involved, then the law doesn't really care.|`|61YfPllfaa	because like every law the laurel and hardy labour party brings out. nothing is thought through.|`|UNCVt1yLaa	its illegal to watch porn under 18?  well that's a bit silly, last time i looked it was a free country if someone wants to willingly watch porn when they are a teen let then, the law on making it at 16 is ridiculous, 16 year olds would be In trouble for watching a play back of themselves|`|zWqKuIQuaa	A 16 year old would not get into trouble for watching porn, but I would get into trouble if I sold it to a 16 year old.

Adults are prohibited by law from providing porn to minors (under 18) so an adult that permits a minor to watch it is considered to be providing it.  No one can legally make porn under 18.  While porn usually is about sex and usually involves sex, the two are not synonymous.  Porn is about the display of sex.  Although consensual sex may be legal in many states at 16, the display of sex by those participants is still illegal.    Now, for inconsistent logic, why is it in the U.S. that a kid has no right to privacy for taking aspirin or over-the-counter cold medicine, but does have a right to privacy concerning taking birth control pills, which must be prescribed?|`|AA11540917	in the UK you can be a porn actor at 16 ?    sorry, but that's very hard to believe.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	True, but different countries different rules|`|FZzIZ5GWaa	You're not technically allowed to make porn until you're 18. That's why you never see any under-18 porn movies because its illegal to film anyone under that age.    Sex is allowed at 16 because in the eyes of the law you're old enough to make your own decisions and know everything that needs to be known.    Porn films are 18+ because anyone under that age is classed as a youth.|`|8XqfYG2Baa	I'm pretty sure the legal age for porn is 18 in england aswel.  But i'm not sure about the watching porn part.  Maybe its because some porn can be quite...extreme...and/or disturbing.  Also its got to cover the bases for most countries.  That is to say the legal age of many countries for sex and viewing of porn is 18 so they apply the rule for all countries.    And to the point below about it being a free country, its all well saying that but go out and stab someone claiming its a free country.
