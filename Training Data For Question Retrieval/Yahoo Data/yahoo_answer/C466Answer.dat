I have 1 grandson that likes race cars. We put a racing boarder around his room and did the curtains in racing with matching bedding. My 2nd grandson likes sports and is 10 so we need his room to last through young teen. We decorated his with sports memorabilia Football curtains with matching bedding.    Hhhmmmm 4 yrs old.

PAWbTYLoaa	Reason One: The Home or Structure is Historic  If the House or structure to be moved was once owned, lived in, or used by a famous or historically significant person, or community of persons then it is considered historic.       Reason Two: The Home or Structure is Sentimental  If the house holds sentimental value to someone, i.e., Grandfather was born there, it's the old home place. or, conversely, because of negative sentiment or bad memories - Just get it out of here.      for other information you can check my source site|`|YyAUdSPeaa	Some buildings have historic values.  Some people have the love for art and some wood crafting just can't be made anymore.  Some houses are cheaper to move them then to build a new one.  It could cost $50 to $150,000 to build a new house where moving it may cost only $20,000, depending on the distance and the work involved to move it.    But people will do what needs to be done to be happy.
PAWbTYLoaa	Two-story houses and structures are moved all the time, in different ways, according to their structure.  One way is to remove the roof, transport it separately, then put it back on once it reaches its final destination.  Another way is by using suspension.  Suspension is a technique by which the upper portion of the two story upright structure is cut horizontally between the first story ceiling and the second story floor, then suspended in mid-air with a crane or team of pole tucks. The bottom portion of the structure is then driven out from the top portion.    I recommend you a company name wolfe who are very reputable in this regard.|`|3W18HDxxaa	if its structurally sound yes it can be moved    they move 5 story   buildings    ever watch Mega movers ?|`|YyAUdSPeaa	Yes, anything can be done for the right amount of money.  There are many house moving companies out there.  You will have to call one of them and see what they require.    I saw on TV that movers moved a light house that was in danger of being washed away because of land erosion.  They moved back off the beach something like 300 feet to a new safer location.  You can look at the photos in this web page http://www.history.com/content/megamover... and see some of the stuff that can be moved .  It will blow you away watching this TV program.  The house in the photos must be 3 stories tall.    I think a house that would be able to be moved would be a home that is not on a concrete slab.  But I still bet it can be moved safely.  Like I said that if you have money anything can be done.    Have fun and maybe they will make a show about moving your house.
9tQSBMAQaa	Chances are your drain is clogged with hair and soap scum.  I had this problem and tried all the chemical products with little help.  I finally used a forceps to reach down into the drain and remove the hair.  A forceps is a thin pliers like tool.  You can get one at the Walmart fishing section.  Fishermen use them to remove hooks from fish, but it worked great on the drain, too.|`|7vzM3Y1Yaa	a clothes hanger... or draino|`|zAHeKvE1aa	Try one of the grocery store products such as "liquid Plumber" or "Drano" and be sure and follow the directions.

AA11366224	Generally, the temperature inside is about 5 degrees C higher than outside.  You can improve that by surrounding your plants with bricks (the older the better) and by covering them with horticultural fleece if there's going to be a frost.  See trays should be kept above 5 degrees so a severe frost may damage your seedlings.
zTVF7ClEaa	The most popular type of undercabinet lighting on the market are the 1-4 bulb xenon line voltage surface mount options.  Yes, they are surface mounted, however they are only 3/4-1" in height, and when they are placed in the middle of the cabinet (not up at the front) they are not very noticeable at all.  Plus you can find them in either white, brushed nickel, or a bronze finish.     I would use these over the hockey puck lights because you do not have to worry about cutting into your cabinets, and you don't have to worry about low voltage transformers, which will have to be replaced at some point.  Check out these undercabinets from Kichler lighting  http://backbaylighting.com/search_indivi...|`|ihbqJAGUaa	Yes, recessing lights are your best option aesthecally. Low voltage " hockey puck" style lights are your best option for depth 3/4". Install new removable bottom shelves in the cabinets. Use plywood and route out wiring. Center cuts for false shelves on new lights. Trim exposed face of plywood with molding. To match stain contact cabinet manufacurer. This is always a problem with undercounter lighting and by re- working bottom shelves it wont be seen from the outside.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	mount them flush and put a piece of trim along the front of the cabinet. no need to recess.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	Yeah  that's the way it's done. I don't like it either. There are two other options.  A- put an over-hang around the cabinets  B- find a style of light that looks good there, ( I haven't found any yet but there must be something out there)  If you find something that is attractive let us know  Thanks|`|mumEFa9taa	There are little round lites that people put in china cabinets to light up - china.  I've seen them under cabinet's and it looks very good.  You might be able to get some that are battery operated and you wouldn't have to deal with wiring at all.     I've always thought to try the cheapest way first...and if you don't like it - then change it.  You could always sell the lights on eBay if they don't work out!!|`|8ScFozGuaa	The other option is LED tape lights. Look at www.eurofase.com to see and example.

AA11537802	concrete is made of water, aggregates (sand and/or gravel) and portland cement. not dirt.    the strength of concrete is determined by the amount of time it has cured and the conditions that it was cured under.    Concrete would not cure in a vacuum as the water would rapidly boil off.    but if the concrete were cured in a dome, in earth-like conditions there is no reason you could not expect the same compressive strength.    I do not believe that the moons lesser gravity would affect the outcome.|`|AA11618168	Go get some and let us know how it works out.|`|SAabFxB2aa	I would think that it could be made as strong but with a great deal of difficulty when you consider the lack of air, lack of water, lack of air pressure and way less gravity. I guess you could says yes to your question but, you'd really have to work at it. And, I'm not sold on the idea that the moon was part of the earth, jury is still out.|`|CVwifXjNaa	intriguing question, i would assume so but their must be some slight difference between the 2|`|GaLw1qMwaa	haha floating concrete.

I have had it for about 4 years.All I do is make sure it has water. It blooms regularly and looks great. Don't fertilize them at all. If you do, make sure is designated for African Violets. Not all fertilizer is good for them. The most important is proper watering. Good luck.
v3xEtuLLaa	What brand is the range?  F3 means different thing to different manufacturers.  Please give more info.  Thanks.    EDIT:  The F3 error code is faulty oven sensor, from what I can find.  The sensor should be hanging inside the oven, and looks like a thin wire.  Pull on it and you will find a plug.  Unplug it, being careful to not let the wire fall back through the hole.  Plug a new one in and this should take care of the situation for you.  If you have an ohmmeter, the sensor should read in the neighborhood of 1100 ohms.  You may want to check an appliance parts and service center near you.  If they don't have the sensor in stock, they can get it for you.  Hope this helps.|`|3W18HDxxaa	call the company that made it,  it should be under warenty,    the control curciut is bad,    Modern eletronics   Yuck
nEKTPaT6aa	F3 on many brands means a faulty temperature sensor which is the metal probe sticking out of the back wall of the oven. It also sounds like you have a bad clock/ control as well.
kfvgkZ1saa	I am guessing since you specifically mentioned stone mason, you do not mean a general mason.  General masons deal with squares - block, tile, brick.  A stone mason is different because they typically deal with organic shapes and need to have a good eye for overall appeal of the finished product.  While I don't believe there is a formal education to become one, having some coursework or background in art and design couldn't hurt.    The best way to start is to become an apprentice to a stone mason.  Find people in your area who are stonemasons, do the kinds of work you are interested in and talk to them.  You would be surprised how many would be willing to talk to you so long as you approach them with a positive and willing attitude.  I design swimming pools for a living, and would be happy and even flattered if a young person asked to meet with me for an hour to just ask me questions about my job.      Understand you are starting at the bottom, and be willing to work hard.  Although a lot of stonemasons do quite a bit of heavy work, I am sure you can fine a niche that appeals to you and is marketable.  Don't let being a female hinder you.    If you are passionate about it, GO FOR IT!|`|dXrHoLMCaa	your biggest stumbling block will be whether your hands are strong enuff to pick up bricks, after bricks, after bricks, all day long.... and if you can lift a concrete block into postion on a wall..... do that, and you're in !!!....|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Sure, females can be masons.  Apply for a job with a masonry company and be prepared to work your butt off.  Most start with a laborers position, hauling brick, stone and mortar.
346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	The pipe can be left in place and actually should be as long as it's in good condition.   What needs to be done is to seal the broke end so no more frayed off fibers can enter the atmosphere. That is of course if the pipe is no longer being used.    Asbestos is dangerous, but over concern creates a scare.    Since the damaged end is not in your living quarters and is up in the attic, I hope you get to feeling better about it.     Construction workers can be exposed to 0.1 fiber/cubic centimeter over an 8 hour work day and an excursion limit of 1.0 fiber/cubic centimeter as averaged over 30 minutes.    Call them back to wrap and seal it up. Check their work and forget about it.    Of course, if you want to have it removed, by all means do so. It's just that fibers are released a lot of time during removal. That's why I support leaving it there until necessary to remove it.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	In almost every case study I've read, the amount of airborne asbestos particulates has increased AFTER the asbestos removal efforts. A better choice would be to seal the pipe in question with a plastic cover.    Several years ago the New York City School System spent $1 BILLION on asbestos abatement. Tests after completion found a substantially higher amount of asbestos particulates in the air.    The entire asbestos scare was based on junk science and the media looking for the latest big story.    Check here: http://www.junkscience.com|`|3W18HDxxaa	you can remove a 3 sq ft area by your self,    if its true asbestos   in a house i doubt it , the only time its in a house is in floor tile,     and that's called non friable    the scare about astobestos is blown way out of portion,   we use it by the 100 lb bag to insulate  steam pipes and no one has  ever gotton any thing from it,    its like any kind of dust, use a dust mask   you can remove those and throw them in the trash    Info Info where is it located, what is it on ?|`|3sU90myfaa	William b has it all messed up here..stating asbestos can only be in floor tile..It can be in the tile,on the exterior siding, and even in the drywall joint compound and textures as well if old enough...Alot of houses years ago had a roofing tile that was actually the inside ceiling as well that was 6 inch thick asbestos..along what I mentioned, there are more than 100 other building materials that contained asbestos  as well...When an asbestos abatement team comes in they remove by whatever means necessary the asbestos..then will spray areas with a sealer that will contain any  dust preventing future airborne asbestos ..If the company does what they should..let the house air out for a day afterwards for any remaining airborne particles then you will be fine..Just make sure the removal contractor gives you a WRITTEN certificate/contract stating it was/or will be totally sealed or removed|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	I also agree that the asbestos thing is totally over hyped...asbestos is not dangerous unless it becomes friable, that is, that it begins to crumble and release particles in the air. Even that, I'm not convinced of the danger because I had several uncles that worked shipyards during WW2 and spent 4 years blowing asbestos insulation into the ship hulls. They all died of natural non-asbestos-related causes.    So, asbestos is really found in all sorts of building materials, and was widely used between the 1920s to 1970s. It turns up in paint, plaster, adhesives, floor and wall tiles, insulation, popcorn textures, wrapping duct work and boilers, and a few more things. If you have an older house, you can not make it 100% asbestos free until you gut the entire house and start over.     What is friable and can be easily removed should be removed. If it's sealed in the wall or the floors, leave it alone or you'll end up stirring up more asbestos.     We have a 120 year old house and went through an abatement process because we had 5 layers of kitchen linoleum that had to be removed with two of the layers testing positive for asbestos. Had we merely applied new linoleum over the old stuff, we would have been fine to leave it alone.|`|jB57W3Esaa	the best bet is to get removed by a certified abatement contractor (and hope they do the job right). the asbestos is already disturbed and its already airborne since u said that they worked on it and broke it and my guess is its 22% chrysotile. so it has to be removed since the asbestos fibers is already disturbed u cant just cover it up, and make sure they run pcm samples( well they have to, but some don't) while they are doing the abatement to insure the Quality of the removal.also make sure they set up a decon before they sstart working so the asbestos wont spread

OMOuxROoaa	well first off congrats....second with a "pig" hubbie try and get him to change a bit help a bit or just make sure you pick up in the morning or at night b4 you go to sleep. it is hard to give advice on decorating cuz i have no clue what you have or what you are working with. decor singleout what you want and what you can do with out. i would rather have empty walls then all this stuff i do not like. then rummage go to good will and find stuff you like that will match with what you have. you will not get itpic perfect over night. organize the clutter.....get rid of things you don't use...baskets can be your best friend. Make sure that EVERYTHING has a "home". sorry don't know any good websites though besides ikea for organizational tools and great cheap things you can buy.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Sounds like your 'nesting instincts' are kicking in..best way to be happy in your home would be to keep what you love and get rid of what you don't. This will cost you nothing. Start decluttering..it is a long and nasty job, but has to be done. If there is no room for an item, and you know you won't use it or haven't used it, then get rid of it, sell or donate. I would start in the kitchen as I think this is the heart of the home..go through your cupboards and get rid of any dishes or storage items not needed..then I would do the bedroom..your sanctuary..sort clothes, stack them neatly, hang things up..then move on to the next rooms..one at a time...and remember, you have to make a mess to clean a mess..you can possibly use items you find to organize other things. You can organize with boxes (decorated with paper or paint you have laying around), make a memo board with material over board and ribbon to stick in pics and papers (could us a dress you don't wear for material), unused glasses or mugs are great for pens and pencils, stack your books neatly, magazine organizers can be made from cereal boxes covered in paint or paper (cut diagonally one top corner off)..lots to do. Good Luck, but try to rest as much as you can and maybe leave some of this till after baby arrives..congrats to you and your family!|`|0JjHacT6aa	Decorating can be a hard thing to even think about sometimes.  If you're looking for organization then baskets for books, papers, magazines can be a HUGE help.  You can make cubbies too, or get your husband to make them. They're cute and efficient.     For other decoration, go to walmart for low prices. its not a bad idea, they have the Home and Garden decor. If you're afraid of guests, add a slash of color, get some pillows or a rug.    Ideas:   - One of my favorite things is going to Micheal's and getting a vase, filling it with those little beads and adding fake flowers.   - add a rug or some pillows (color and comfort)   - inexpensive end tables (organization, at ikea)   - your own photography and frame it   - candles on a mantel   Those are some little things for decor    some magazines to look at are Home and Garden or if you go to home depot they have about every decorating idea there is, and micheals too.    I hope I helped.  Have fun decorating =]

Put the garment on a flat surface, pour Lestoil generously on the stained area, and scrub in small circles over the stain. The stain will slowly lift from the material. For really stubborn ones, let it soak in a concentrated solution of Lestoil and water for a day or two before doing the above steps.

UnBu0JwFaa	My answer is to try Dreft laundry detergent. It has enzymes that eat proteins because it's for babies and they spit up a lot. I would let it soak in it for about an hour before washing. If that doesn't work, then you may either have to take it the dry cleaners and see what they can do knowing that there is always a possibility of paying to have it cleaned and having no real results. If all else fails, you may just have to toss it. Good luck! Let us know what works (if anything)!|`|cpmiJQyIaa	It would help to know what type of fabrics they are but since I don't know I will list several things you can try.    1) Try soaking it in a detergent with Enzymes in the warmest water the fabrics and colors can tolerate.    2) Try soaking it in White distilled Vinegar and water in the warmest water they can stand.    3) Try soaking in water with an oxi bleach added to it in the warmest water they can stand.    4) Soak in water with Charlies Soap laundry powder in the warmest water they can stand.    5) Soak clothes in water with Baking soda in the warmest water they can tolerate.    Whatever you try, once done, rinse well and air dry.  Once dry, do a sniff test and see if the smell is gone.  Since I listed several different things you can do, if one doesn't work you can try another.    Just a word of caution, if any of the clothes are silk or wool, do not use an enzyme detergent or oxi clean.  Those can actually eat through and damage those fabrics, and make the vinegar a weak dilution while keeping a close eye on it.|`|ZFXGI56Qaa	wow   sounds like you washed it in hot water too  you may not be able to save it but   how about trying an old tooth brush  you will need to physically remove the egg  by careful and repeated scrubbing  the flour would not make it smell  when you have removed as much as you can try a soak in a product with enzymes  my favorite is biz  it can usually remove proteins  but repetition is probably going to be necessary    ......
v3xEtuLLaa	kW = kilowatts, the amount of energy consumed by the unit.  That's how your electric company sells their juice.  Hope this helps.|`|sI8vLjjZaa	Kw is Kilowatts where 1 kW is 1,000 Watts. It is a measure of energy. In the case of refrigerated air conditioners it is how much energy (heat) the air conditioner can transfer in an hour. Refrigerated air conditioners are also known as heat pumps.    Another unit of measure that is used with air conditioners is the BTU (British Thermal Unit). 1 kW/hour = 3,412 BTU/hour.    For a standard double brick, concrete slab roof tiled house with shaded windows you generally require 120 Watts per square meter of floor space. Thus a room of 7m x 7m = 49 square meters would require a refrigerated air conditioner of at least 49 x 120 W = 5.8 kW (5,880 Watts) capacity.    For domestic applications generally the largest split system air conditioner you can get is about 8 kW (27,297 BTU). They do make split system air conditioners much bigger than this but they tend to be rather loud and thus generally better suited to industrial applications. If the area in the house to be cooled were larger than 67 square meters then you would use two split system air conditioners for that area.
1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	I haven't worked on small engines in quite a few years, but for Tecumseh's as well as Briggs, the Pulley was usually bolted on with a 9/16 bolt.  I can't remember if they were the tapered shafts or if it was the Briggs.  In any event, Take the bolt out, then put it back in, only threading it in half way.  If its still on the machine (Which it probably is if the pulley is still on the motor)  get a long screwdriver so you can apply some force on the pulley, away from the engine.  Then your going to hit the bolt with a hammer, or better, if you have an air hammer.  You'll probably need to use an extension or a big punch (the bolt is recessed into the pulley), which is going to be allot easier with 2 people. A couple of whacks should do it.  Then just remove the bolt and the pulley should fall right off.  There's a 2 to 3 inch key in the key-way, you'll need that for re-installation.  When you put it back together I would recommend putting some No-seize on it.|`|03sLrNPCaa	If you mean belt pulley versus flywheel, most often they are attached to the shaft with a set screw in the hub of the pulley.  In the interest of balance it usually is a recessed "Allen" screw.  Very hard to see.  Check and see it that is the arrangement you have.  You can remove the screw and slide the pulley off.|`|eGKmeTUCaa	to remove the pulley off the crankshaft you will need to remove belt guard, then remove belt from pulley, then turn crankshaft manually until you see a set screw in the middle of the pulley you will need an allen wrench to remove set screw. Once set screw is out the pulley should come off crankshaft with a little effort.

03sLrNPCaa	About your only solutions are to plant smaller types of plants, shrubbery for example, or plant the trees far enough away that the roots don't interfere with the walls or fences.  Trees will send roots in any direction it is easy growing and where the moisture and nutrients are.  Even the conifers with big tap roots going straight down still have roots growing to the sides.

Fluorescent lights work by and electrical current passing through mercury and an inert gas, producing photons. These photons react with the phosphor powder coating on the inside of the bulb, producing light.   LEDs are illuminated solely by the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material.  What you are looking for is and LED fluorescent replacement.   LEDs last much longer. But the LED replacements for fluorescent lamps are expensive, but will most likely be cost effective in the long run. They don't appear to be readily available in stores (yet). If you do a Google search, you can find the available online.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	I don't think that it is a product. Flourescent, and LED are two different forms of light bulbs.

TdIbrGYYaa	You may need to have them refinished but with that in mind, there are things you can try first.      Try straight baking soda.  It's an absorber and odor repellent.  Poor it on and leave it there for 24 hours and vacuum up.  Kind of grind it in with a brush or wear rubber gloves and use your fingers.      This is gonna sound crazy but get a bottle of Finesse shampoo.  That stuff does wonders on stains.  I use it to clean my fiberglass showers.  Don't use it on the hair anymore.  We learned this when a bottle of it fell in the shower one day and leaked all over while we were at work.  I was pissed at first but then I rinsed the shower floor and the stains that grind into fiberglass that you normal spend hours cleaning, were gone.  So it may work on this too.  Poor in on, rub it in and then just leave it there.  Come back with bucket of water and sponge to get it up.

Since you have heavier stains to clean right now, use about  ? cup  white distilled vinegar with 1 (or 1.5) gallon of clean warm (not hot) water.   Then mix well and clean the floor.    When you get the wood floor cleaned to your satisfaction, apply two light coatings of wax.      Treatment on the rugs can be OxyClean (or a generic that you can get at most dollar stores).  Use 2 scoops with 1 - 1.5 gallon of warm water.  Again don't use HOT water because it will cause the OxyClean to dissipate more quickly in the solution, and it will lose it's effectiveness.      ** Vinegar is a very common thing to use for cleaning wood floors, and there are several restaurants that use it for that purpose in daily cleaning.    ** OxyClean (generic) or Awesome (all purpose cleaner)  are two cheap cleaning agents that you can use for almost any cleaning around the house.  You can use the same concentration of OxyClean on the carpet as mentioned before or if you decide to try Awesome, you should use about ? c. with 2 gallons of warm water.    This works best if you have a floor cleaning machine (Bissell, Rug Doctor, Dirt Devil, etc.)    You can pour it into the machine and use normally, or apply directly to the floor (flood) and  use the machine more like a wet vac.   The advantage with the second option is that you give more time for the solution to be on the carpet, and loosen any dirt or light stains.  ** Note, if you apply directly to the carpet, go over the area more than one time so you remove as much water as possible.    When you are done cleaning in any of the cases, set up a fan to help the floor dry faster.     (do not use a fan when waxing.  it will leave ripple marks in the floor.)

Now, your two tips will become 4, and so on.  All the while the plant will not be able to grow as fast (as if left alone) as it will have re-develope these apical meristem cells which happen to be the fastest dividing cells in a plant.

v3xEtuLLaa	Well, with the info you give, I'd estimate between $40 and $5000.  How much do you have, how many inside corners, how many outside corners, etc.?  Labor rates vary widely from one place to another, so your best bet is to find a local carpenter who can do this for you.  Call several trim contractors, and compare their bids.  Hope this helps.    EDIT:  Most carpenters don't bid their work by the linear foot, they bid by the job.  You could have a 40 foot wall that would take no time to install.  Then you could have an inside corner that needs to be coped and can take the same amount of time as the 40 foot wall.  As I said earlier, call a local carpenter/contractor, and they will get you in the ball park.  Rates where I live are probably very different than rates where you live.  Good luck.

6bP9CEqMaa	If there are gas lines and a burner then it is going to burn a gas, if there is simply a pit with ceramic tiles then it was made for burning wood. Another good way to tell if it is a wood burning fireplace is to look for a flue or damper handle below the burning cavity so you can adjust the air flow to the fire. If you do not care about the look of the chimney, and you research fire codes and such, and your a little handy, you could probably do it out of metal exhaust tubing (ductwork) but it would look ugly as sin and you would have to make a hole in your house hehe. We have one in the garage, so we don't care about looks and it just vents direct to outside through sheet metal like exhaust tube, which was very cheap, then just sealed up around the hole with concrete. As to your details, well, to burn wood you really would want to have that damper/flue to be able to burn the wood easily|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Depends on the brick layer and what he gets by the hour or by the square.You will have to get bids from several different ones to see what is your best bet.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	If it is gas, there will be a burner in the fireplace, or at least a pipe connection, and also a pipe at the rear to connect gas to. If it is gas, don't burn wood in it. Chimneys will have to be installed, unless it is an electric heater, Call a pro. A free fireplace that burns your house down is not a bargain.|`|MLs34eZ0aa	If there's a pilot light on it then it's gas.  If there's lines running to and from it, than it's gas.  If there's fake logs attached, it's gas.  It does make a difference. If you build a fire in a gas fireplace, and it's hooked up to a gas line, you could have an explosion.    Putting in a chimney will depend on your house's current structure.  The best thing to do is get a quote from a few different places.  If it's an independent fireplace (stove) than you can usually just run ducts out, but if it needs to be put in a wall than you'll need a chimney installed.

v3xEtuLLaa	It sounds like you tripped a breaker.  You will need to go to the electrical panel and look for 1 breaker that is either in the middle position or is to the outside of the panel.  Flip it all the way to the outside, then back to the center and you should be good to go.  Hope this helps.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	no worries buddy. go to the power box thing you were at before. do you see all of those black switches. turn every single on of them and then turn them back on. after you get done turning them all off and on, you should have power. there is too much power being drawn on that circuit and if you plug the heater in again it will probably do the same thing. try unplugging something that is plugged in on the same wall to see if it works. good luck hope this helps you out.|`|t00QAsfJaa	you tripped a breaker.call your mom or dad and ask them what you should do|`|YY24gmRpaa	Wow a whole ten points just to tell you to reset the breaker and unplug the heater!|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Adding the space heater to the circuit may have overloaded it; you should turn off or unplug something and see if that helps.  The phone jacks don't have any connection to the power plugs.    As others mentioned, there should be one breaker in a different position; turn it completely off, then on again--AFTER turning off/unplugging something in the living room.  Don't try jamming the breaker to make it stay on; that could cause a fire.
LLeQyWGcaa	try bleach, but if it's coming through your walls i think you have a more serious problem. there is moisture in there coming from somewhere, maybe a leaky water line, or drainage pipe. you should have this looked at. i don't know if you live in an apartment or a home. call the maintenance man if you rent, or tear out a chunk of the wall to find out what is going on. if you don't get it fixed mold will start growing all over the place. once it starts growing fast, it's hard to stop.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	Kilz or a similar primer will cover over old mold stains, but if there is still mold growing in the wall, it will eventually leach through the new paint as well. The best solution would be to find out where the moisture is coming from that is feeding the mold and fix it, then paint.|`|cpmiJQyIaa	If you have mold that can be a problem.  The simplest solution and least expensive is paint the walls with Killz Primer.  Otherwise you will have to find out where the moisture is getting in at and seal it.  That means a very lengthy and expensive tear down.  The Killz primer will kill the mold on the surface and provide a barrier from it coming through again, there in by, making it a safer dwelling.  Mold can make you very sick.    Once the Killz Primer is dry, paint with whatever paint you wish and you are ready to go.

Also they have little things you can put on your key rings so when you leav the house you can turn it on , and when you come back you can turn it off . If a door gets open ( when the alarm is off ) it beeps and tells you which door is open . Also you can set the alarm to where if a door get opened ( while the alarm is on ) it beeps like ten times before it goes off . Hope I Helped! ( they also give you stickers and signs that say ADT security service that you can put on your windows and stick in your yard )|`|T5UBrKZjaa	The most inexpensive alarm is better than no alarm at all. Here are a few suggestions to make your buck go a bit farther.    First, try to have as many doors HARD WIRED as possible. Wiring doors is key. Next, this is where it can get expensive...try to do the same with windows. If you can't afford to HARD WIRE each window, use interior motion detectors, especially if you have a second floor. There are different grades of these detectors so know what you want. It may not be an option if you have pets wandering thru the house though.    Motion detectors should be less expensive than hard wire becasue they are normally less labor intensive to install than hard wiring.    Next, make sure that you go for the WIRELESS, transmitter that is usually an OPTION. This is an added expense, installed in an attic,  HOWEVER, intruders, when enterring a home with/without an alarm sign, tend to cut any/all exterior visible service wires. (the thinking being that they are cutting your phone/cable wire that will interupt the signal to the authorities. If you have the WIRELESS option, it will be transmitting without the intruder knowing it.    Next, install the siren INSIDE the home. First, it scares the the intruders, it also deafens them, giving the authorities the ability to sneak up on them while they are in your residence.    It also doesn't annoy your neighbors when your alarm accidentally goes off. It certainly will do that for the first few weeks. A happy neighbor, not constantly bothered by a constant accidental alarm, will most likely stick his head out the window to give your place a look, when he hears the muffled alarm, hopefully seeing something.    Also make sure you get a wired smoke alarm as part of the package. It will discount your homeowners insurance as long as you have monthly central station monitoring.    Finally, all alarm monitors are basically similiar...don't let them or TV ads fool you. Its someone who receives a signal from your system, when tripped. They, in turn, call the police for you. The service calls your home.. no answer OR someone answers the phone not being able to provide a code word, the police are notified, some will call you as well.    Also realize that these monitoring services are sometimes located OUTSDIE of your state, so when they call 911, they may not have access to YOUR 911. They in turn call your local police, who in turn, call 911 & respond.

547Ln6rNaa	If it's a tiny puppy it's probably not that big a problem, just wash it a little and turn the mattress over, puppy pee isn't that bad, a full scale dog wee is a big deal.

A few hours later, use a little pet-urine cleaner, and then spritz with some vinegar and water from a spray bottle after that dries.

There are enzyme cleaners on the market especially for urine.  You might find them in the grocery stores, but for sure in pet stores and home medical supply stores.  I'd start with plain water since soap can set a stain.  For now, just use water and blot immediately.  Keep blotting and you may need to keep apply fresh water and more blotting.  Hopefully that will be enough.  If not, get the enzyme material, you'll need it elsewhere with the puppy.  You apply it, let it work and then blot up.      In the future you can steam clean the mattress.  I save that for a hot dry day so the mattress will dry before bedtime.     I highly suggest a moisture resistant mattress pad for everyone.  Accidents happen.

G4TJ8nibaa	S traps are illegal. (IRC 3201.3 & UPC 1004.00) so that doesn't work.  A 24" tail piece is illegal (IRC 3201.6 & UPC 1001.4) so that doesn't work either.  Can you move the sink or the hole? If you come up from the floor add an elbow and go 3 times the diameter of the pipe (center to center) it becomes a legal P trap (you should have proper venting of course).  Basically the distance from the center of the up section of the P trap to the center of the pipe going down has to be 3 times the diameter of the P trap. Putting a P trap in the basement is illegal as it have a tail piece greater than 24".|`|0TuWYaneaa	It should be okay. I would use a regular sink trap that can be replaced if necessary.

Usually there is a verticle pipe in the wall, and you plumb your trap to that, and everything works fine.      An s-trap is illegal because it isn't properly vented.  It can siphon the trap and allow sewer gases to come back past the trap.      The same if you put a p-trap under the floor, if it isn't properly vented, it is also illegal.|`|fd731e800e3dd221fe8a61746720ede0aa	I've never heard of S-traps being illegal.  However, if they are, they ARE!.  A P-trap will function just as effectively below the floor as it would upstairs entering the wall.  The only downside I can imagine is that you will have an extra couple of feet of drain exposed to the air (and your nostrals) - and it could, conceivably, become nasty.  It seems to me that you have found a simple solution to a silly problem.  I wouldn't hesitate to implement it.|`|XAIiOFkXaa	1. Why can`t you fit a P trap in the pedestal?   2. If it won`t fit ring you local Council, ask for building control to get the gen on S traps.  3.

The water has to fall away from the outfall of trap to ensure that it syphons away. If the outfall rises from the trap it will not work.  Simples!|`|sLoK3Arsaa	why dont you use a pederstal trap very slim and you cant see them behind pederstal   you can get these from any plumbers merchants
FlsrXuJOaa	I think it is a great idea b/c trees will be around for a long time, they help the environment and can be very beautiful! Some advice:    1- like someone said before, if you don't have room on your own property for the tree, contact your local parks and recreation to see where you can plant it.     2- give some thought to what kind of tree you want. Do you want something that flowers in the spring? Do you want something that grows big or stays small? Do you want pretty fall color?     3-go to a local (preferably independent) garden center and ask one of the people in the nursery department to help you pick out a tree. They should have a variety of choices in all different sizes, so you should decide beforehand how much money you want to spend.     4- plan on following up on your tree if it is not planted in your yard! Newly planted trees need watering and a lot of time parks and rec staff can't get to every tree often enough. Check up on it every so often to make sure it is doing ok and let someone know if it isn't.     sorry for your loss. I hope you end up planting a tree for your loved one!|`|ivg0lRUraa	Of course you can, we did that for my friends father. Its a really great idea|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Sure you can go buy a tree and plant it. Depending on where you want to plant it, you might need some elses approval to do so.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	Contact your local city parks department.  Most have a memorial tree planting program.  Most require some type of payment for "perpetual care" or the tree's purchase.  It varies.  This way the tree will be placed where it will receive care for the coming decades.  Just planting a tree doesn't mean it will thrive.  Garden clubs may also have such a program or a nature center.|`|r5iuE2mSaa	You have to get approval from your city or county. sorry for your loss but they will be able to help you with your decisiion making.|`|AA10302860	Well I don't know the specifics, you see, I've had several trees planted in my honor so I can tell you from the honoree perspective I think the main thing is to not plant the tree on your friends property.

You know to be honest, I think if they had just shown me a tree that was already planted and told me they had planted it in my honor I wouldn't know the difference.

3uX6UxPQaa	Hey if money is no object go with the triple glazed and an argon gas. It'll get you the most R value in a window and will also help heat transfer in the summer so the AC doesn't have to work so hard. My personal experience is go with Vinyl. It doesn't transfer hot or cold as much as ALUMINIUM and doesn't need maintenance like wood does. I've had to replace a lot of good windows only because the home owner never painted the wood frames on the outside thinking they didn't need it
v3xEtuLLaa	I would use aluminum clad for the exterior, primed wood for the interior, and order it with the jambs sized for your house.  Low E double glazing will give you the energy efficiency you are looking for.  The key to success is in the installation.  Make sure that they set the nail fins in a bed of silicone caulk, and use spray foam insulation between the window and the rough jamb to seal it tight.  Hope this helps.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	Triple pane is more efficient. If you have aluminum siding, the windows should be also wrapped in aluminum.

Low-E filters out more than 90% of the UV rays and reflects heat back into the house.  Argon Gas adds insulating value and decreases noise from outside.  Your home will be warmer in winter and cooler in summer...saving $$.  Triple pane compared to double pane...there is just not enough difference in the U-value and the R-value to actually spend the difference in money.  The U-value refers to the actual amt of heat that the material/glass allows through, and the R-value refers to the materials ability to resist the transfer of heat.  The lower the U-value and higher the R-value is what you want.  As for wood or vinyl...vinyl "should" last forever...as wood you will eventially have to replace or refinish.    Also the more chambers in the vinyl frame the more energy efficient.

Carpet and other fabric-y things notoriously hold smells forever. You could try shampooing the carpet. Or better yet buy a big box of Borax (laundry detergent) and sprinkle it all over the carpet (seriously), then stomp all over it to get it really far into the carpet fibers (seriously), let it sit for a good long while, then vacuum it up. It'll smell like fresh clean carpet! And the borax really cleans the carpet too..|`|m9pXE9Puaa	Vinegar gets rid of horrible smells
kqDbWzKvaa	Have your mom come over or take the coat to her when she gets home.  She will know what to do ,  You have it soaking in hot water.. is your coat made of wool ??? if so the hot water will shirk the coat.  scrubbing it is a good idea.  you will really smart to put it in water to soak.. Your mom will treat it with a stain remover and wash it in the washing machine at the correct temp. setting... your coat will be ok.  Sorry about the paint . it can happen to anyone.. good luck

GaLw1qMwaa	check your ac/heat registers. when it is off do you feel a cold draft out of the vents?  might need to reseal some of your duct work.|`|IUdJalDLaa	What is the velocity of air coming out the registers in the cold area, increase fan speed or close down on the registers in the warmer area|`|cpmiJQyIaa	As a general rule, heat rises.  You could have cooler air coming up from the floor.    I would check your furnace filter and see if the air ducts are clean.  Is air coming through.  Does it feel warm? Also, what is the thermostat set at.  Does the thermostat reading the air temperature match what you have it set on.  If not, you may need a new thermostat.
oxqXDBR9aa	There are 2 of us and our bill just came in at 66 for the quarter.   Our water here in the south west is the most expensive in the country, so if you live elseware yours should be about the same as ours so long as you dont waste it.  Our rate is Water 1.57 per cubic metre (1000 litres)  Sewage is 2.79 for every cubic metre of water used.  So we pay nearly double for sewage out than water in.|`|InLhfJ6Daa	Hi, rising costs are always a problem.  My water bill on a meter is 320 a year.  Believe me this is a fraction of what my neighbours are paying. You may like to look at how your water from your guttering is taken away.  If any of it is taken  away by soak away rather than the sewerage system then you are entitled to a reduction.  I think it is about 10%.

It's not that easy to say, because we'd need to know things such as, is your house detatched, how many baths/showers do you have per week, do you have a dishwasher/washing machine and how often are they run?     I can tell you our bills for 3 bed detached, two adults, are about 50/month. But it all comes down to your consumption.|`|AA12180617	Unless you each have a separate bath every day and use much more water than normal you will be paying much less than on your rates    budget for 20 to 25 per month!|`|DzRLYAAJaa	We're a family of 4, and we normally paid around $50-$60 US dollars a month.

Have you checked to make sure that you have a pump? I once lived in a house that depended on convection to circulate the water.   If you do have a pump have you made sure that it is working and any motorised valves are working?  Have you tried bleeding it with the pump on? If you have then try it with the pump off?  There are a multitude of different types of system and I cannot advise without knowing your heating circuit. To be absolutely honest. Neither can anyone else.|`|oxqXDBR9aa	Could be an air lock in the pipework, turn off all radiators that are working, turn heating on and see if they get hot then.

UnBu0JwFaa	I rinse them as they are used and stack them in the sink. As I am cooking dinner I unload the dishwasher and re-load it with the dirty (but already rinsed) dishes. After dinner I clear the table and rinse the dishes and finish loading the dishwasher. If pots and pans don't fit, they get washed. If there are only a couple small items (a couple glasses, coffee mugs, etc.) I rinse them and put them in the sink for tomorrow's load. I run the dishwasher when we to to bed so that it doesn't disturb anything.|`|nqINitkmaa	When a dish gets used I immediately rinse it off and use a sponge I then put it in the dishwasher, I keep doing it until the dishwasher is completely full then I start the dishwasher...

I have lots of dishes and four people in my home, so I will usually run a load everyday or every other day depending on how many are home getting dishes dirty.

F513XhWFaa	The thing to try for the stains would be water and vinegar but, some pet stains cannot be removed because the acids in the animals stomach can actually bleach out or permanently change the color of the carpet.  I would not recommend Oxi-clean because it oxidizes turning to hydrogen peroxide (which is a bleach) and can discolor some carpets.  Nor do you want to use soapy spot removers which will dry sticky and re attract dirt.     For the odor you want to try an anti microbial deodorizer and try to keep the carpet wet with it for at least 24 hours.  Anti microbial deos are a natural enzyme that dissolve the odor causing bacterias food source essentially killing it    To be honest you may not be able to remove the odor.  If the puppy has gone repeatedly in the same place the urine may have soaked into the the padding and sub flooring.  If this has happened the only thing you can do is remove the carpet and padding and use a anti-microbial deodorizer on the sub flooring, keeping it wet with the deodorizer for at least 24 hours.  If the odor remains after that you need to seal the the sub flooring with primer before re-carpeting.|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	with cleaner|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Use Liquid Tide.  Instead of using carpet cleaners use Liquid Tide.  This will clean it up.|`|cpmiJQyIaa	I would first try to clean the spots with a dilution of Oxi Clean in water.  If that did not work then I would try Charlies Soap all purpose cleaner.  After getting it clean.  Sprinkle still damp spot(s) with Baking soda and that will help pull out the moisture and smell from the carpet.  Once dry, vacuum.|`|wdAFoZt6aa	I have been doing research on this too. My puppy generally goes on the linoleum if she goes in the house (thank goodness) but sometimes she doesn't make it there and my mother-in-law visited with her dog and left a pretty big stain. I am a freak about carpet stains and odor and here's what I have researched and am going to try.    1/2 c Peroxide (like oxiclean but way cheaper)  1 c Water   1/2 c Vinegar  4 drops of Lavender Essential oil  4 drops of tea tree Essential oil      The Essential oils are great for cleaning and they smell great too. They are disinfectants. Although the vinegar should interrupt the pH of any remaining bacteria, making the bacterial invironment even more uninhabitable (thank you mircobiology class!!), its just another great way to have a fresh scent. The Essential oils can be picked up at your natural health food store. The Tea Tree can be found in the vitamin section in Wal Mart and is very inexpensive (can be used to treat cuts scratches and yeast infections too!!!) Lavender and tea Tree are great for everyday uses and have a million uses each hahaha.They are not like conventional oils so will not stain most surfaces, but check a small spot just to be safe. They also come in a variety of scents and since they are all natural, unlike parfumed oils, should not have any detrimental effects on your health. Asthma sufferers make sure you can tolerate the oils before you go crazy with them. Some trigger my asthma, just be careful if you are sensitive.    And as with every other method, dry as much as you can. If the pet still insists on going in the same spot over and over use a very diluted mixture of ammonia and water. (1/4 c 1c water) keep in a marked container and use as necessary.If that doesn't work then the issue of a different method of potty training should be used. Taking a proactive approach will keep you from having to scrub in the first place. I swear by crate training. It worked with my first dog. Unless you have a whiny puppy, it can work for you too. (It can be done by ignoring the yelps, but that get annoying after a while.)    Crate training consists of geting the metal wire pet crate just big enough for the pet to lay down in. Dogs typically, wont go were they sleep or lay down in it. Then when you are ready to get the dog up in the morning or when you come home from work, you can take the animal outside to relieve it's self. Then play as usual. Your pet, theoretically, should get used to our schedule of potty training and accidents should be fewer and far between. Also limiting your pets consumption of food and beverage will help too. If your dog eats and drinks all day it going to have to poop and pee all day even when you are not there. They really only need to eat once or twice a day with "snacks" in between. these "snacks" can be served as treats when the dog completes a good task. ie, going to the bathroom out side. 1 for pooping 1 for peeing. (2 if both) make sure you reward the dog right after it does the deed so they remember why they got the treat. Also teaching you dog simple tricks like sit and lay down is another way to give it treats. Pet Co has a good dvd to watch about pet training and it says that you still need to watch how many treats you give your dog. Do not exceed 10% of the dogs diet with treats.    And yes it is okay to rub thier nose in it and give it a spanking. Not a big one, but the animal may not be making the connection that that is a bad thing to do.     Hope this helps|`|XzRKYYGsaa	Resolve High Traffic Foam , This stuff works good on many things , like My dad is a mechanic and I have white carpet and he wore his work boots in the house and had grease tracks all over and where he sit down and scrubbed his feet back and forth I just knew the carpet was ruined , but I used the Resolve High Traffic Foam , and It made the carpet the original color it was when we got it , so then I ha to clean the rest of it ..That is how good that it worked for me .      Also baking soda works good at removing stains , You mix three parts baking soda with one part water (adjusting for consistency ) you want it tobe a thick paste but be able to spread it over the stain , and then with a brush scrub it and add more if needed , It may take more than once but It does work just not as good as the other stuff above , Once you have removed the stain you need to clean and rinse , just wipe it up with a rag , and rinse and repeat , What baking soda that you did not get up once dried will come up when vacuumed.    and the baking soda will alsoget rid of the odors .
L8zmQS8Jaa	I will give you a bit of a rundown first.  Tub re-glazing is done by etching the baked on porcelain finish with acid first and then a new paint is sprayed on.  The new surface is not baked and it is not as durable as the original.  An older tub can look stunning!  But if it will get a reasonable amount of use it may wear out in about 3 years and look worse than the original.  Older tubs (80 years plus) tend to come out better because of the better quality of the foundation.      Because it is a paint, the proper masking of areas not to be covered is important.  Anything else will be painted.  There is an issue of how much of the caulking around the tub should be covered.  If this is later removed and redone (as in re-grouting) there might be old tub edges exposed.     Another alternative I have seen advertised recently is to install a plastic insert into the old tub.  The durability of this will depend upon the quality of the material and the usage.      Finally the stand in alternative is to remove and replace the tub.  This is a major job as the tub is installed under the surrounding walls and will not simply slip out.  Part of the walls must be removed.  Usually older tubs are simply broken up in place and the job starts from there.    And absolute lastly, if it is not too bad you can use a product called "gel gloss" available at the local big box store.  It makes everything look great too but it is only like a wax and nicks and scratches are only "glossed over."
Jy15drCtaa	Refinishing kits DO NOT work.      There are 2 main issues with these kits. A professional strength bonding/whetting agent is not available over the counter. They are hazardous chemicals that are best left to the professionals. The de-laminate agent has the same issue(s).

AA12289981	Why do you want to get rid of it?  Use it!  I have a theatre degree and have acted on many many stages all over the world, and I have a bit of stage fright every time I am in front of an audience.

I was in drama before in high school and my teacher and a few of the other students believed in using the traditional saying, "Think of everyone in the underclothes".  HaHaHa!  To be fo'real about it, try rehearsing in front of a crowd, selectively you friends and family.  They can be a good support group and coach for you in telling you your mistakes and maybe give you the motivation you need to overcome the fear.  But when you actually get on stage, try taking a deep breath, view the atmosphere and try not to look directly at the audience, more so, look over their heads and try to imagine that you re rehearsing in front of your friends and family.

Vl4ZLrf5aa	Cheapest method: slather up the molding with paint & stain remover, let set for 10 minutes, and then hit it with a toothbrush. Repeat until clean.    Easier method: Slather up the molding with Peel Away, cover with paper, let sit overnight, and peel everything away. Costs about $30 per gallon plus $5 for the paper.    Easiest method: unless this is some kind of valuable historic antique molding, why don't you buy some new stuff instead? You can probably find what you need at a millworks yard (NOT big box hardware store).

I always have a tub of oxy clean in my house for unexpected stains.
NJULnXiyaa	As said, its not a good idea. Even with a garden shed, moisture and humidity can be a major problem. There's not much air flow and things can get  moldy and mildewed. Also, its usually against rules to use balconies for storage. You'll be better off renting a storage space or finding a friend with dry basement.|`|AfnOU04paa	Geez, I'm not sure that storing things like books and clothing on a balcony are a good idea due to the variances in temperature and humidity.  Paper, leather, rubber will suffer drying out and cracking.    Is is possible to buy a small shed to fit on your balcony?  Or Rubbermaid and Sterlite make storage closets and cabinets made from a tough plastic.  I would put a tarp over it as well for those times when the rain is wind-driven sideways.    If you are at all handy, you could build a three-sided structure with an angled roof (to shed water) out of 5/8" plywood.  Start with a platform of the size you need, and adding casters would help if you need to move it around and keep it off the floor.  I would tarp this too, tying the tarp under the platform or holding it down with rocks or bricks.

DzRLYAAJaa	Depends on what you're putting the rubber roof on. If it's for an RV, I've heard they're about $3,000-$5,000.
a1NRQ0WYaa	Goto http://manualfox.com and ask them to find the manual (not free). Its the easiest way.
v3xEtuLLaa	Carpet tiles are great for a basement.  They are very easy to install.  You snap a line, snap another one square to it, then spread the adhesive.  Let it dry somewhat, then lay the tile.  They are expensive, compared to regular carpet, but you can save the installation cost.  Another advantage is that you can replace one or two tiles easily if they get damaged.  You can get them at a flooring distributor or home center.  Hope this helps.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Great choice for the do it yourself er...Inexpensive...Most home centers or flooring stores will carry them
bo2mJOR8aa	you can try hairspray from an aerosol can. It helps to get most inks out of carpets/ upholstery and fabrics. keep spraying it on and soaking it up with a  thick paper towel.|`|gzZn4aBKaa	i do not have a clue -as to the carpet issue but if you where to remove permanent marker from a non porous surface such as a plastic binder ! - if you use an alchol wipe/injection swab that they  swab your  arm with before  taking blood - the alchol content seems to lift permanent marker to an extent-  not sure how it could work for  carpet - and i dont think i would like to try either!! <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|ui9guh6Gaa	Oh my!!! I'm loling right now. But I know i'm not supposed to laff. sorry. Um, keep putting water on it until it get faint. DO NOT RUB IT!! Then it gets bigger. In the future, immediatly pour enough water onto it and then dab a paper napkin or something on it. Always worked for me.|`|6qrRznp7aa	I have done this with some success Pour a small amount of plain fingernail polish remover on the ink and let sit for a short while.  Take an old towel and blot for a time changing areas on the towel so you don't transfer more ink that you blot up.  I have even stood on the towel to get some weight onto the towel to blot up completely. You may need to pour more remover on it.  Or you can cut the area out of the rug!!|`|Mglfxm16aa	It really depends on what kind of carpet it is. If it is a white shag rug, try using a little dab of bleach. You could also try Oxi Clean: Duel Power. My son likes to color and sometimes he gets into our sharpies, my husband and I find that mixing duel power, spray n' wash and lemon juice works like a charm. |`|vExGtP3vaa	destroy the universe|`|6vntAB9Daa	BLEACH! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! oxy clean....tide pen.....BELACH....srait up bleach?
6xyeYjkkaa	That's why it's nice to live South. Haven't had to use it yet and don't expect to anytime soon.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	Haven't turned it on yet. And we've had our first frost already. :D|`|kZTx2Phhaa	Yes - we've only turned the heating on once when it was really cold the other night and that was for a few hours only to take the edge off the chill.  Also reduced the thermostat down a couple of degrees and dug all the fleecy jumpers out for the family, invested in some hot water bottles and have used open fires in the evening before the children go to bed if it gets really cold.  <br>  <br>  Have also turned off the hot water for the evening to cut that down by half - everyone has to have their shower first thing in the morning now unless they are particularly mucky. (Rugby & children = muddy bodies).  Am hoping that the next bill is less than the last one even with all this. <br>  <br>  ....and I'm sitting here with freezing feet - I'm off to find some socks to put on.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	We have been wearing more layers of sweaters in recent years. This year we may wear our snowsuits most of the time and just keep enough heat in here to keep the plumbing from freezing. I can heat the bathrooms separately for bathing and showering, and will be watching that it is just barely tolerable in there.<br>  <br>  I grew up in a house where we had a butane heater in the bathroom and a fireplace in the living room. The rest of the house was not heated at all ever. We spent most of our time in the living room!! Went to bed under all those old heavy quilts and soogans. You don't move at night that way so the beds never get messed up. And you take about 2 minutes to jump from the bed into clothes including shoes.<br>  <br>  No, as a Sr Cit I really don't want to do that again, but will if I must.|`|yNi1adRqaa	I have been careful for the last few years and now each year I try to beat the previous year for the first day that I turn it on, lowest temp I can keep the thermostat on, how many days in a row with house at 50 degrees, etc. So far I have been able to beat each previous year.|`|oIo3Yktoaa	I have never been one to worry about heating bills cause I would rather be warm and pay for it but since the price rises I think twice.|`|dySHIwYxaa	Only as per normal, I turned on my central heating the other day just to test it 's working fine before I really need it. Its not nearly cold enough yet.<br>  As I have part underfloor central heating im looking forward to my toasty warm floors on a cold day. I do switch tariffs to get the best prices though.|`|hGGZZOYEaa	with care?  I need to heat my house it gets below 0 here a lot. It wont change much from other years. I'll just be paying for others heat as well.
DzRLYAAJaa	If you're getting lots of credit card offers, what I do is circle my name and address and write "remove from list" on it, enclose it back into their return envelope (usually it's already postage paid) and drop it back in the mail back to them. I did that for about 1 1/2 years and now I don't get any more credit card offers.|`|aLy3ai90aa	You can get a P.O. Box. But as far as junk mail its very hard to stop it.
v3xEtuLLaa	You can't remove them.  Those are pits in the glass.  The only way to fix it is to replace the glass.  It won't hurt anything, it just ruins the appearance of the window.  Hope this helps.|`|pNVx1mEHaa	a very fine abrasive polish and an electric polishing mop
r0oc9Rngaa	1-Brick cost more<br>  2-Transportation of brick is a lot more expensive due to weight plus you have to use a lot of cement and the labor becomes much more.<br>  3-Because is cheaper.<br>  4-People tend to use the cheaper construction.<br>  5-The economy sucks and we have to go for the least expensive option!|`|6xyeYjkkaa	They still use brick. It just depends on what price range you're looking at. Brick siding costs more.|`|zM9Lj21waa	plywood and brick cost more to do than plywood and vinyl...the brick you see on houses is a covering and not what the whole house is made of...|`|px5v9tfeaa	its costlier to make and people can knock your walls down in a hit i dont understand this either (sorry this isnt an answer but im just as curious as you!!)|`|AA11067291	to cut cost
