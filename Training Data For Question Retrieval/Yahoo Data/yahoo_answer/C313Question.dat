20090307182121AAUA8lU	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Is it just me, or do I have very good luck when betting against the Jonas Brothers?	Lately, I've been having good luck when I bet against the Jonas Brothers. My first case is that I bet an earlier Yahoo! Answers user that the Jonas Brothers wouldn't top Miley Cyrus on Good Morning America and we all should know what happened ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axMIYkhbA...  If you don't believe me, I have an exert from that e-mail here: Miley's a great singer/actress/person. I like/respect her a lot. BTW, The Jo Bros are going to be on GMA in 2 days. I bet you that their performance will not top Miley's. If you win, I'm buying their CD. If I win, you and the rest of the Jonas committee will cease to mock Miley. Deal? (and yet to this day, you Jonas fans have not lived up to that bet).   The next case is I bet a friend of mine at school that the Jonas Brothers would NOT win Best New Artist. Adele won it, I went crazy, and I won 50 cents (should have bet a dollar). So am I just lucky that I'm winning these bets or is it all coincidence?

20090307183413AAPLnjh	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE CHRIS BROWN SITUATION. HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL?	Now i would like to start off by saying, it was a mistake, and everybody makes mistakes. But there is no reason for beating up a women. Notice I ain't say hit. He BEAT HER UP. Like she was another man. If you're that much of a punk to where you beat a woman senseless, you're not a man at all. Everyone says there's two sides of a story, and nobody wants to say anything till they find out more. To me...the pictures were all i needed. I hate when girls say "she must have did something". SO WHAT! It'd be different if he just slapped or hit her, but he BEAT her. No woman deserves to be beaten down by a man. No matter what she did. You don't see him getting into disputes with other men. Why is that? If you're man enough to hit a women you better be man enough to hit another man, and get hit by one too Personally i feel like whoopin his little pretty boy a**.doesn'tesnt deserve a second chance like all you die hard fans says he does. Be honest, ifwasn'tasnt famous, he was your boyfriend, and he beat the fu** out of you. Would you really take him back? Would you give him a second chance? He sent her to a hospital. No matter what she did didn'tideserveseve that. No woman does. And if you women dont have enough self respect to realize what he did was wrong. Then maybe you do deserve a guy like him. Just so you can understand what Rihanna went through.

20090307190053AA2mfbK	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What would you do if you had an abusive mother?	I seem so happy all the time, right guys? Well, guess what??? My life is a misery business. I've been abused by my mother my whole life. I'm 15 now and I deserve independence. She has been abusing me since I was a little kid. She'd beat me up just because she wanted to w/o any valid reason and she says things that really hurt my feelings. I'm very open minded so I tend to absorb everything she says in. She says that I'm a shameless b**ch who's not her daughter and she told me to walk around the streets naked. She told me that no one will ever like me because I'm deluded which I'm not. She told me that she hates me more than anything in this world. Yesterday she found out that I'm not in any honors classes and she made a huge deal out of it. I told her that it doesn't mater because they give extra credits in honors classes but they only do one or two extra questions. I have a 90+ average for all my classes but she's not happy. She has beaten me up for that. I feel like screaming!!! but I can't..I buried my head on my pillow and cried for hours. Out of anger, rage, depression and what not..She won't let me make any friends and like I said, she says that everyone will hate me(which they don't..). She thinks that I have no feelings. She doesn't get the fact that I'm a human and my feelings get hurt when she says negative comments about me, like i'm stupid, i'm ugly, i'm shameless and everything else. Once my cousin told me to run away from home because he knew what she does to me. She didn't support me at all when I cried for months and months when I was in 7 and 8th grade. I got bullied badly during that time. Sometimes I feel like killing myself. I tried once..I was gonna suicide myself but I was too scared and my mom told me that I'm gonna go to hell.    Now, I've decided to talk to my school counselor about this on Monday and my mom won't let me do my homework. I don't like going to school without my hw done . I feel ashamed and stupid. The reason why she won't let me do my hw is because I didn't take any honors classes..
20090307185041AAuZkVe	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of......?	What do you think of the first chapter of my book (not done just started today)      Chapter 1    What You Need To Know          The year is 5752. There is over 7000 different communities. 12 communities take up most of the world which now is 70% land because of a erupting volcano that destroyed most of the world then recreated it. The 12 communities are extremely different. One of my favorite communities is the Wanaka community. There rules are odd and probably the most strange there is. Its like they live in the past yet in the future. The main rules are about marriage. Rule number 1 happens to be “You MUST be married by the age of 20 and not before the age of 15.” In Wanaka if you are a girl your father sells you to your husband. The women have no say what so ever. Some girls try to run away but by doing that they leave behind there friends, family and there life. There are also many consequences if you are caught running away. You are sent to work in a factory and in the factory you work so hard and long that you rarely have time to sleep. When you do fall asleep you are awoke by the cries of terror and pain of other workers. Most of the time when you run away you run away with a man that you fell in love with. Are story begins when 12 year old Alice the daughter of one of the richest men in the community falls in love with Steven the son of a poor pig herder. Her father refuses to sell her to someone poor.

20090307185805AA0Dtab	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Joke! I thought it was pretty funny.?	A cowboy rode into town and stopped at the saloon for a drink. Unfortunately, the locals always had a habit of picking on newcomers. When he finished, he found his horse had been stolen.   He comes back into the bar, handily flips his gun into the air, catches it above his head without even looking and fires a shot into the ceiling. "Who stole my horse?" he yelled with surprising forcefulness.      No one answered.      "I'm gonna have another beer and if my horse ain't back outside by the time I'm finished, I'm gonna do what I dun back in Texas and I don't want to have to do what I dun back in Texas!"      Some of the locals shifted restlessly.      He had another beer, walked outside, and his horse was back! He saddled up and started to ride out of town.      The bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, "Say partner, what happened in Texas?"      The cowboy turned back and said, "I had to walk home!"

20090227104035AAmxiOY	Entertainment & Music;Magazines	Where & how can I recycle my old magazines?	I googled this question and everything that showed up was tips on how to recycle like dropping them off at doctor's offices, passing them on to friends or using them for crafts.      The thing is, many of them are old (early 2000's to present) so I doubt any of my friends want them, and a lot of them don't belong in doctor's offices due to nudity and vulgarity (Rolling Stone, Blender, Spin, Interview, a bunch of celebrity gossip mags, etc). Also, many of them have pages ripped out or cut up from when I used them to make collages and other crafts.      I can not throw them out, I would be filled with guilt! At the same time, I'm cleaning out my room and don't want them around anymore.      A lot of other search results said many locations do not allow you to recycle magazines with newspapers. If this country is promoting recycling and saving energy, why the hell is it so hard to find somewhere to bring these old magazines!?      Are there specific places I can bring them? Please help!      -please don't give me more "ideas" on how to "use" my old magazines! I just want an answer on where to bring them so they can be recycled.

20090307205412AAJpiQ7	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Is it weird for me to like these rap artists?	Ok, so all of my friends listen to Lil Wayne, ,T.I., Soulja Boy and other artists like that. I cannot stand Lil Wayne and I think his voice is annoying. They think it's weird that I listen to Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep, Tupac, and Dr. Dre. Most of them have never even heard of alot of those artists. I mostly listen to rap from the 90's because I think it's so much better than songs on the radio today. So I'm just wondering...is it weird because it seems like I'm the only person who isn't obsessed with Lil Wayne...

Especially towards the end when that kick drum and snare hit...so damn funky! Probably funkiest beats I ever heard.

Where they like you bugging out. No, I'm just feeling the beat. Anyway, what musical beats that you thought were as funky as hell! Old or new.

If you ain't never heard of these two female rappers. You tube it and listen to Rah Diggah's flows in her videos and Lin Que's flows in her videos. You'll be like this is a close one.

So, since I know there are plenty of songwriters out there, I need your help.. how do you get inspiration to write lyrics and then put a melody to the lyrics?  It has been troubling me for some while, I have only been able to write 6 songs so far, and most of them are pretty much just throw away's.      Any tips?

20090307205103AAFtbIl	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Help! What is this older cartoon?	Ok, I don't have a lot of information but it's worth a shot. It probably aired around 1995-2000, maybe earlier. It was of the sci fi genre. And I think it was a mini series. The few other bits i remember: The lead was a male teenager (I think he had black hair) and there may have been a girl with him. There were aliens of some kind. They may have been invading the earth. I believe some of these aliens were gray and walked around on all fours, similar to dogs, maybe with longer forelimbs. I think they were bad in the show but i remember the main character befriending one of the aliens/creature (because he saves him or something?) I just know it becomes good somehow and starts to protect the main character. I know this is a long shot and all this info is weak, but it's been on my mind for years. Any help would be great :) Thanks!

Just Your Something by Nicolette      Your eyes, sparkle in the sunlight   I begin to wonder what i'm feeling, baby i swear to God i'm dreaming.   You know everything to say to me to make me smile.   You know everything to do so you can make me laugh   My heart breaks when you leave, just want you to stay a little while longer.   I've been broken so many times, but this time i am stronger.      i'm not gonna let go, just because it's not the right time.   im not gonna give up until i make you mine.   I'll continue to write about you,   Until i get the guts to say it to your face.   Boy you drive me crazy, yeah you simply amaze me.   You're just someone I can't replace.   I'll keep wondering what it would be like to be your everything,   or even... just your something.      I look at your smile it shines so bright.   Baby don't you know you're all i think about at night.   Sometimes it seems like you love me, other times it seems like you don't.   Sometimes it seems like we could end up, sometimes it seems like we won't.   I know i'm not alot, i know i'm not perfect,   but baby if you just give me a chance you'll see i'm worth it.      i'm not gonna let go, just because it's not the right time.   im not gonna give up until i make you mine.   I'll continue to write about you,   Until i get the guts to say it to your face.   Boy you drive me crazy, yeah you simply amaze me.   You're just someone I can't replace.   I'll keep wondering what it would be like to be your everything,   or even... just your something.      All of this time i cant believe you would go and do this to me.   I'm falling apart now, this is tearing me up now.   I'm going crazy, baby please, just, save me...      i'm not gonna let go, just because it's not the right time.   im not gonna give up until i make you mine.   I'll continue to write about you,   Until i get the guts to say it to your face.   Boy you drive me crazy, yeah you simply amaze me.   You're just someone I can't replace.   I'll keep wondering what it would be like to be your everything,   or even... just your something.      please be honest.. and do not steal

20090307204626AAEBLHF	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Watchmen V. Maus : Which is the best?	I've recently read both of these graphic novels, and while both of them were extraordinary, I felt like I enjoyed Maus a bit more. Everywhere I go on the net, however, everyone calls Watchmen the greatest graphic novel of all time.       I personally think that with today's era of dark comics, novels, films, music and basically everything else, Watchmen doesn't seem that invisionary to my generation.         Anyways, for those who have read BOTH graphic novels, which one do you prefer and why? (If you simply put one or the other, I'm assuming you've only read one or the other).

20090307212037AAGD7Zm	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	"Oh ye, of faith"(or not): what religious compositions for you, epitomize the "sublime"?	Today is the Jewish Sabbath; tomorrow, the Christian - those of you who are Muslims, forgive me, but I don't know which day of the week is celebratory for you; or even if there is a weekly observance.  Nevertheless, please feel free to respond.           Let me clarify my question.  What I'm requesting, are your choices of religious compositions - those written for a specific religious occasion or ceremony - which for you, represent the most masterful creations in this particular realm of classical music.           I'm not really familiar with the music sung/performed during services at synagogues, and realize I'm not following my own guidelines; but I do love "Schelomo" by Ernest Bloch.  For those who may not be familiar with this beautiful music, here's a You Tube video of the first part:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jII0zpO9...            When it comes to Christian religious music - I'm non-affilliated by the way, am a yogi - I think the Beethoven "Missa Solemnis" is unsurpassed.           When it comes to Requiems, I think I'll go with Verdi's; and for no other reason than for its glorious "Dies Irae"- I know, I know, pretty lame reason.            And although it's really not a genuine Requiem, I love Brahms' "Eine Deutsche Requiem": so go ahead, and pooh, pooh me.                                                          Alberich

I swear, when I saw that press conference with MJ a few days ago, I thought it was an impersonator. I couldn't believe how, well, HEALTHY he looked... had a lot of hair, didn't look as frail...    However, the thing that really sold me on the idea that this might be an impersonator/hoax was his VOICE! It didn't sound high and wavery at all... it sounded much deeper than usual... totally weird.       http://video.aol.com/video-detail/michae...       Maybe he IS planning a comeback/farewell tour, but had an impersonator deliver the news in case he thought he might get assassinated, or have a shoe thrown at him, or something (u know MJ is a crazy one)?!      I just think this whole thing is really fishy and wonder if anyone else thinks that this might be a ruse created for some strange reason!

20090307220100AAENVlR	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Could I have been a musician?	People pointed out to me growing up that I have 'plumbers hands' - wide palms and short fingers - not long, dexterous fingers as needed to play string instrument. I also have some deafness in my left ear. So, I never got into music, including how to read it, though I was in a choir some in middle school. I like to listen to music occasionally, but I otherwise I don't have strong impulses to perform. I don't know if that's because I lacked encouragement, or if I'm just not driven to be a musician.       So, help me resolve this - could I have been a musician, or was it never to be due to genetics and a lack of musical drive. Please include your own background in music.

You cant erase it, you can just try to move on. Sometimes its hard to just forget about it, its like a boomerang, it just keeps coming back again.      Whether its a flame in your eyes or the song in your head just being played over and over again. whether its the thought in your mind or something following behind you that just never goes away. try to forget about the past and just live for today      the pain cuts deep inside, its like your living in a lie and the truth is never revealed. you feel so alone, and like your heart is made of stone. but if you believe it will be okay.      whether its a flame in your eyes, or the song in your head just being played over and over again. whether its the thought in your mind or something following behind you that just never goes away. try to forget about the past and just live for today.      you only get one chance so make it what you can. dont dread on what you cant change, just live for today      whether its the flame in your eyes or the song in your head just being played over and over again. whether its the thought in your mind or something following behind you that just never goes away, try to forget about the past and just live for today.

IV went too far. Plus, I think they made it too preachy and political with the "save the whales" message. If they had waited ten years, they would have been looking for dolphins, pandas, or good science fiction writers.       I personally like 1, 2, and 6 best (In order of 2, 6, 1, then 3, 5, 4)      As for TNG, 7, 8, 10, 9      Yes, I like the Final Frontier better than The Voyage Home.

20090307212919AAGk8qX	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Whats with movies and duel themed trailer?!?	I first noticed it with the movie "good luck chuck" with Dane Cook. The first trailer i saw of that movie made it seem like hte movie was centered on Dane's character "Chuck" and that Chuck was a good luck charm = everytime he slept with a woman, they found their love shortly thereafter. ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R7Qw1vG_...  THEN i saw a completely different trailer - one that made it seem as if the movie centered around Jessica Alba AND Dane Cook...that Alba's character was sooo clumsy, Chuck needed good luck to stay alive and love her...( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRfr9zTgT...       NOW i have seen this AGAIN...with the movie "I Love You Man." The first trailer i saw made the movie seem like this guy was engaged and needed a best friend to become his best man - only he doesn't have any MALE best friends. So he goes on heterosexual "man dates" to find a good best man - seemed effin hilarious ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNElMm8ot...  THEN i saw yet another, completely different trailer - that made it seem as if this guy HAS a really good best friend, and WANTS him to be the best man - BUT he doesn't get along with the bride-to-be so well....         SO, my question is - why do these movies have 2 different spins on their movie - it seems to me that ONE direction should be the way to go when presenting a movie. . . http://www.aceshowbiz.com/video/download...       when i saw good luck chuck, i could tell that the movie was primarily about Chuck's "good luck ability"...not the fact that he NEEDS good luck to be with Jessica Alba....so why the confusing/conflicting trailers???

Well, I've been searching for a little while now, and can't seem to find any good sad-sounding piano music.  No singing would be preferred.      I've been making videos using a few different programs, and I need some good music for a scene when a hero falls, with many people beating him in the middle of a rainstorm.  This also doesn't necessarily have to be PIANO music, just something slow, and sad to set the mood.  Something along the lines of the song Mad World by Gary Jules would do great... except.. there's singing.      Any help will be greatly appreciated. :)

20090307220904AAe5yTr	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	What does my monthly love horoscope mean ?	PISCES (Month of March Love Horoscope)      Nothing will be as romantic for you as good, clear, honest, direct communication on the 1st. Yeah, there's lots of room for flirtation, teasing and word play, but it's essential to your romance that the two of you can talk about everything and anything -- especially about what's going on between you two right now. If you can talk about things, it's a good sign that this relationship could be the one. The 5th and 6th are two more great days for romance. All you have to do is show up, and there could be kissing! Focus on some diet and health issues on the 11th and 12th. Have you been skipping your workouts? Why? Don't you think it's absolutely essential to take good care of yourself if you hope to be half of a healthy relationship? On the 17th, it pays to listen to the voice of experience, but if you simply must find out for yourself, then you must. There is something wonderful coming your way, romantically, on the 24th and 25th. Be sure to enjoy every moment -- and all that chocolate! If you're tuckered out on the 30th, take the night off. Cook up a big pot of soup, turn off the phone, curl up with a good book and go to bed early.               Thanks a lot !! ^_^      GOD BLESS !!

Un hombre joven estaba de compras en el supermercado, cuando noto que una viejecita lo siguió por todos lados. Si el se paraba, ella paraba, además se quedaba mirándolo.       Al fin, camino a la caja , ella se atrevió a hablarle y volteándose le dijo :       'Espero que no lo haya hecho sentirse incomodo; Es solo que usted se parece       mucho a mi hijo que recién falleció.       El joven con un nudo en la garganta, replico que estaba bien, que no había problema.       La viejita le dijo, le quiero pedir algo poco común..       El joven le contesto diciéndole, dígame en que puedo ayudarla       La viejita le dijo que quería que le dijera       'Adiós mamá'       cuando me vaya del supermercado, esto me hará muy feliz!       El joven sabiendo que seria un gesto que llenaría       el corazón y espíritu de la viejecita, accedió       Entonces, mientras la viejita pasaba por la caja registradora se volteo y       sonriendo, con la mano le dijo adiós HIJO!       El lleno de amor y ternura le respondió efusivamente       'ADIOS MAMA'       El hombre, contento y satisfecho por que seguramente había traído un poco       de alegría a la viejecita, continuo pagando sus compras.       'Son $154.387 le dijo la cajera.       'Por que tanto si solo llevo cinco cosas!          Y la cajera le dice:       ' Si, pero su MAMA dijo que usted pagaría por sus cosas también'.

20090227120108AAgIJ0u	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Im having a dilemma & i need some opinions?	I'm having a dilemma and I would like some opinions. I'm going to be having a party..and it's a theme party. (ABC) which means "Anything But Clothes". Basically everyone has to find something to cover their body with other than clothing. It's creative, different, & fun. I know my question looks long, but please help!      One I can't decide what day I should have it and here are the reasons why:       My whole life my sister has been the center of attention out of the two of us. It makes me feel like an awful person for talking like this, but for once I would like to be that person, especially since I came up with BOTH the idea to have this party, along with the theme and for once I would like to just be recognized as that person.       My sister won't be here one of the weekends I'm trying to decide to have this. Now the issues are: that if my sis is here & comes to the party she will bring more people which is great for a theme like this..BUT she will again recieve all the attention and will always be "better" than me..whether it's because of her outfit..of anything.       The other issues are that if I have this party when she is not available..there will be less people, which isn't as fun. However, I will atleast feel a little more wanted at the party and it will also give more notice to others & more time to come up with ideas for their outfits, which will make it more fun to see who comes up with what. Why this is, is because it's a week later.       The party will either be next week, or the week after.       I need help?! What should I do? I hate calling my sister out like this..I love her..but for once..I just want to be that person. No rude answers please. :(       what would you do??

20090307231630AAJ5SbM	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Anti-Guitar Hero.................!!!!!!!!!…	Guitar Hero is a fun game but I hate the fact it makes really good bands liked based on one song. All the songs by the bands that are less commonly heard of but appear on guitar hero are unappreciated because everybody only knows like one song from the band. It leads to musical unappreciation. Like the other day I was listening to RATM and this kid's like oh i love RATM. And I said what's your favorite song by them. He's like Bulls on a Parade. I'm like do you know any other songs by them besides the one's that are on Guitar Hero. He's like no. See, what I'm talking about, its killing the style of bands. Everyones so focused on that one song that they miss the whole point of the band. Like seriously who heard of Dragonforce before guitar hero (even though they suck)? Guitar Hero also makes you look like a conformist when you listen to bands that are on guitar hero (even if you listened to the band before guitar hero).

20090307223904AAnkgCd	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Perfect blue unanswered?	these first seven are not my own personal questions although they pretty well could because its as if the person had read my mind,   and that we've both come to the same foggy conclusion of perfect blue the movie was WHACK and as great as it was dont plan on watching it over, thats why i wan these questions answered:            1. Did Mima really dress up as a pizza boy and kill that man (think he was the photographer or something)? Or was it Rumi/Mr. Me-Mania/other? I've worked out (in my own mind) that either he was the only one she killed (or did she kill Me-Mania too with that blow to the head?), or she didn't kill anyone.      2. So she started believing that she was her TV show character? And she started going crazy, even before the stalking got really bad and everything? I don't understand why her hallucination turned out to be Rumi. Her insanity didn't have anything to do with Rumi's insanity, did it?      3. Was Mr. Me-Mania the murderer of the scriptwriter and the others, or was Rumi the murderer?      4. Who was on the stage with Cham when they were doing their concert (after Mima left Cham)? If it was Rumi, then why did the fans get so excited?      5. Was Me-Mania the writer of Mima's Room, or was it Rumi? (I think this actually may have been revealed in the film, but I'm not sure.)      6. Did Me-Mania send the fax and the exploding letter? Or was that Rumi in her Mima personality?      7. All those times Mima "woke up," was she being drugged by Rumi or something? Were any of those scenes before "waking up" real?      Oh, man. I just realized that I actually don't get a lot of stuff about this movie. I mean, I understand that Mima, Rumi, and Me-Mania were all pretty crazy, but only Mima got a happy ending. And Rumi was pretending to be Mima to Me-Mania online, and Mima kept hallucinating about her former pop idol self, etc. But I just don't know about some of the details...         and now some questions of my own:      1. who made the website me-mania or rumi?   because rumi was the one who explained what a link wsa and setup   the computer for mima,   did she know mima was scared and going insane, and rumi later told her not to read the diary on the website      2.  why did mima keep passing out, and why couldnt she remember things that happened to her or where she was      3. what happened with rumi trying to kill mima, rumi seemed sane the whole way until the end, it was unexpected      4. why did rumi beleive to be mima      5. and just before the part that mima called the leading actress a doctor and the actress replied " dont mix reality with fiction" or something similar,  when mima was interogated by the psychiatrist for her role the audience was dissappearing and reapering and the name so i got the impression that mima was never really in a movie that she only thought she was an actress and that after she left CHAM that her whole life came crashing down, that she really was raped in a club visting the pyschiatrist, but i guess not from the ending      thats all for now, and you dont have to answer exactly question for question but at least give detailed conclusion of what was going on in perfect blue

CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE OLD PEOPLE                          A jumbo jet is making its final approach to Coolangatta Airport.                          The pilot comes on the intercom, 'This is your Captain.                   We're on our final descent into Coolangatta. I want to thank you for flying with us today and hope you enjoy your stay on the Gold   Coast..                           He forgets to switch off the intercom. Now the whole plane can hear his conversation from the cockpit.                          The co-pilot can be heard saying to the pilot, 'So, Skip, whatcha got planned while we're on the Gold Coast?'                          'Well,' says the skipper, 'first  I'm gonna  check into the hotel,           take a big crap....then I'm gonna take that new stewardess with the huge **** out for dinner.... I'm gonna wine and dine her, take her back to my room and give her a ride on the baloney pony all night long.'                          Aghast and amused, everyone on the plane hears this and immediately begins looking up and down the aisle, trying to figure out who this new stewardess is that the pilot's talking about.                          Meanwhile, the new stewardess is seated at the very back of the plane. She is so embarrassed that she starts running toward the cockpit to turn the intercom off.   Halfway down the aisle, she trips over an old lady's bag and down she goes.        The old lady leans over and says: 'No need to hurry, dear.                  He's gotta land the plane and take a **** first.'

Everything spoken is lies   Broken inside, as I open my eyes   Darkness is all I see   Hypocrisy has gotten me   One by one, all the constellations drift away   I didn’t even know that I missed the day   So I sit and prey   And hope on blind faith   What I see is uncertain, too vague   My feeling keep eating me up   Should I get back on my feet and be tough?   I never know when it’s enough   That’s just the way I am, nobody’s choosing this   Did Jesus have an option of wanting to be on the crucifix?    How is everything corrupted in a world so beautiful?   Its said to be sublime, but seems too unusual   Even religion can despise you    Who would have ever thought that the heavenly skies   Would be selling me lies?   Not even telling me why   But still I speak from the heart   Until the day that im ripped and shred apart   But yet, knowing that im gonna die, I search for a start

If I remember correctly there is no father, just a single mother.      They are offered charity by a church...someone offers to give them Christmas presents for the kids, and the mother declines but then she later changes her mind and goes back to the church but they have already given the presents to someone else.      The teenage son accidentally has his white gym shirt mixed in with the rest of the wash and it has a pink hue now.

You're going to think this is a really immature and stupid question for a 19 year old girl to be posting, but it's true, and yes, I take the bus to work everyday.      Well, me and this guy have been taking the same bus for the past year or so, we don't really talk that much, but we share a smile, a hello on the odd occasion, and usually a 'have a nice day' or something similar. He talks to the bus driver pretty often though who says "He's [the guy] just insanely shy" and that it took him over a year to even squeeze a 'good morning' out of him. He's really cute and really sweet, and funny, to the driver at least.      Well, about 2 weeks ago he stopped taking the bus. It kind of bummed me out since I never even got his name, and waking up and taking the bus to see him (and of course get to work) was actually a nice experience. One of the drivers said he saw him on another route later in the day as a regular for the past week or so. Said he looked lost and lonely. He gave me the time and route, but would it be too weird for me to go take the bus just to talk to him, maybe find out his name or maybe his email?

20090227111834AATcIkQ	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Did anyone else notice the logic error on "American Idol" on Thursday night, Feburary 26?	Maybe it's just me and maybe I've missed controversy about it today, but producers of "AI" made an egregious error in logic on Thursday night.      The top male, the top female and the next-highest vote-getter advance to the Top 12. Last night, Allison had already been announced as a finalist when Ryan Seacrest announced that either Kris or Megan had also advanced. Ryan then asked someone on the panel to comment, while several contestants - male and female - had yet to learn their fate.      The tradition of the program has always been to keep the fate of all constestants a mystery until Ryan announces the results. However, had Megan been voted in over Kris, then she would have been the second female, which would have automatically eliminated all of the remaining females that had yet to learn their fate. (There was at least one.) So, logically, Kris HAD to advance.      Because I was thinking of this in real time, it created an awkward and unnecessary situation for Megan, like she was scammed to believe that she might actually advance.      I doubt the producers play it this way next week.

20090227114417AAA4HeA	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does anyone else think the oscars are losing all their credibility?	The Dark Knight was snubbed at least 3 of the major awards, Wall - E gets a screenplay nomination when it has little to no dialogue, The Wrestler song does not get a nomination whilst "O Saya" does, and Sally Hawkins is denied the justice she truly deserves! There is also the absence of Revloutionary Road and Gran Torino which confirms, to me that is, that the oscars are no longer what they used to be.         And dont forget Waltz with Bashir!

20090227114000AAvYkRL	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What film am i thinking of?	Its quite an old film, about 70s id guess.   its about the crew of a ship that crashes in the sea who have to work their way to the top to escape. theres a fat old woman and her husband (who i think may be the grandad from willy Wonka and the chocolate factory)   theres 2 kids a boy and a girl   and theres a man in a vest whos like the hero, who dies in the end turning a lever to save the others then lets go. the old woman dies after swimming in the water trying to rescue the heroe who gets trapped under some rubble. and theres also a bit where everyone is climbing up a ladder in a tube thats filling up with water, and i can never remember why but this guy in a yellow jacket falls off into the water.   oh yeah and also near the end, theres a woman with frizzy hair who complains about the fat old woman all the time and eventually falls off a platform near the end.   and at the end some rescue teams cuts the roof off them (the ship may be upside down actually) and they escape.   it was years ago that i saw it and its really bugging me cos it was a great film

20090307160947AAAXPAn	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Benjamin Button or Coraline?	As of now, my dad and 10-year-old sister are planning on seeing Coraline and my mom and I are going to see Benjamin Button. However, Ben Button is a lot longer than Coraline and we want to try and get the times as close as possible, and even doing this, Ben Button ends over an hour later than Coraline. So my mom and I are considering seeing Coraline with them and making it a family thing. It's not a big deal if our movie is longer than theirs though, because they can hang out at a nearby bookstore until we're done.      So basically: Benjamin Button or Coraline?   Was Benjamin Button too long? Most of my friends liked it but one said that she felt the plot just stretched on and on and on...
