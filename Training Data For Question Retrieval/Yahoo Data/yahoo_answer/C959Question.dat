20090131202207AAecmhr	Business & Finance;Small Business	Is this a scam or is it legitimate? Working at home as a typist for a company?	I saw this ad on Craigslist.com the other day and I applied. I am looking for a Typist position.       http://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/ofc/10...       I emailed them my resume, within a day the manager emailed me back with interview questions (work experience, clerical speed, etc) and questions about myself. I replied with great answers. After about 3 days, today, the manager emailed back and said they would like to offer me the job. He is going to send me a check of $1800 to buy an Accounting Software (BS/1 Professional) and to send the rest of the money to a shipping agent so they can send me a laptop for work.      The pay is $19 an hour. The manager didn't really discuss much about my position or the company. I'm a little skeptical.      Does this sound legitimate ?

Mine will be very simple, I only worked a few months over the summer, and made around $2k grand total.  If I filed tomorrow when should I expect to see my money?  Is there anything I can do to make sure I get it fast?        ALSO- I read on Yahoo somewhere that I could possibly get the Stimulus they gave out last year since I missed it?  It said somewhere that if you missed getting it, or somehow didn't meet the qualifications but do now, you could request to get it now.  I know that I didn't make the minimum $3k, but I made $2k so I should qualify for $300.  What do you know about that?  How would I go about getting this?      Thanks in advanced for any help. :)

The verbal agreement was in effect starting the month of November 2008 (no lease or contract was done). However, yesterday she was notified that the new tenant was not paying rent; specifically, for the months of December and January. A noticed was received in the mailbox stating to pay within 3 days by 2/3/09 or give possession of the premises to the landlord. If failure to pay or to give up the premises, the land will commence summary proceedings against you to recover possession of the premises. In addition, the new tenant was not paying cable and utilities bill as well. The new tenant does not pick up the phone nor return any of my calls. I will take action and have the locks changed on the apartment tomorrow. The landlord was notified about my actions and will do the change of locks. My question is: is this illegal? The reason I ask is because I am not in the lease.

Hi,   This is my first year of college and Im not really sure about all of the tax issues that go along with tuition.   I live off campus by myself, I claimed 1 (myself) on all of my W2's so my parents were not able to claim me.   I only made 2500$ at my part time job this year.   I have student loans, but my dad co signed for them. I am wondering If I am to claim them on my taxes because he co signed, but the loan is primarily in my name and my parents can not claim me as a dependent student (if they can, they are not claiming me as a dependent I am able to claim myself.) I have been enrolled full time since august 08.      Anyways, the total billed tuition is 8924$I am wondering if I am eligible to claim either the life long learning tax credit or the hope tax credit and how does that work? If I am eligible and do file will that be a part of my refund?      Thanks for any input, the pamphlet I got said that students loans ARE eligible but not scholarships or gifts.

My new LL delivered a new lease to me the other day informing me that he would be increasing my rent along with adding additional charges that were not there before (i.e. pet deposit, monthly pet fee, etc.)  The lease is very poorly written...a lot of holes and it isn't very specific.  Do I have a right to return an Amendment or Addendum clarifying the areas in the new Lease before I sign anything?      For example, my issues are...   My apartment is in an extremely old building.  They're starting repairs…but where they’re doing repairs has not been specified.  In my apartment, it's mostly hard wood floors...that need to be redone...and the carpeted areas are terrible.  Extremely old, cheap carpet that was damaged before I moved in.  I don't feel comfortable paying more for my cat if they're not going to do anything to the floors.  She doesn't scratch the floors or damage any of the apartment (she’s older…very calm and lazy) and couldn't do anymore harm then what has already been done.  I don’t feel paying a pet fee is right unless they’re going to update the floors.      Any ideas or experience in this situation?  I know he has the right to increase my rent and make new stipulations to a new lease.  I’m currently month-to-month (and plan to include a termination option with my revisions to the lease I return to him before signing).  He has also informed me if I want to stay month-to-month I will have to pay double the increase of if I sign a 12-month lease (12-month lease = $75 increase, month-to-month = $150 increase).  Before I get into another 12-month lease with this guy I want to know I’ll benefit from his increases.

The 2009 health benefits list, which I got in Feb on my third day at work,  had no such credit and in fact the premiums had gone up by 20 %.  I feel indignant, like they lured me here under false representations. HR said they have no control over the benefits list. I do not want to quit because of the recession. What can I do?

My parents wouldn't pay a cent, so i'm trying to figure out how much a car would be to buy/maintain. Aside from that, I've read a bunch of articles saying that credit history is a very important factor regarding loan rates. I have a savings and a checking account in my name, and a job.       Is it even possible for me to establish credit before my 18th birthday? I just want to prepare as early as possible. thanks.

Hey everyone, I do not know how to explain this so im going to put this in a story format and alter the names. Here's the case of Deposit drama: Tony and Matt were two bestfriends of years, after high school they decided they want to move in together, so they leased a 2 bedrm apt for 12 months, they did this in Jan 2008, soon after they moved in their another friend, Derrick who was a bad influence on them, started living with them cuz he had nowhere to go [not on the lease] well the didnt want to hurt his feelings and so they didnt complain to the apt manager. By March, he got them drinking every night and getting wasted almost every single nights, girls coming over and every thing. Tony was engaged and his fiance was pregnant with his child, she lived with him for about 15 days before Tony got fed up because he was working nights and wasnt able to get any sleep during da day because of Matt and Derrick partying all the  time and always people being over. So he turned in notic to vacate by March and returned his Key, he yet didnt get all his stuff so he has a signed letter from Matt saying to get his stuff and that and matt is gonna uphold the lease, taking full responsibilty of the rent and the apt. By aug-sep Matt made Derrick move out because he realized what a idiot he was and still kept making the rent by himself. Today is the day when Matt moves out, and he is in no contact of Tony because they are at bad terms. So tony has no clue how the inspection that happens the day you move out went. Which results in how much and when and who gets that deosit back that Tony paid in full of the amt $1400?  Matt would not pick up any calls from Tony so tony doesnt is in no contact of his roomate.       Oh and this might help, Tony made Matt sign a letter stating that- I tony is not responsible for any damage happened to the apt since i moved out by march. And matt signed and it and took full responsibilty.      Could Tony take Matt to court if Matt takes all the deposit to himself. Because even tho Tony paid it from both him and matt, he does have does have that check from the bank saying he paid it from his acct in full?      Please answer! Thankyou!

So--I got on anti-depressants--they are doing their job. I'm in a better frame of mind and they also help with the pain in my back.

I heard you have to go bankrupt before the government helps your medical bill after retirement. In the first place, if you have health insurance, wouldn't it cover your medical cost? (on average how much of the cost they would cover?) Secondly, what kind of income would you have earned that you cannot pay your part of the medical bill?      What is your advice for a younger person who wants to avoid bankruptcy and wnats to maintain good health and some money at retirement.       Thanks in advance.

If lets say you don't pay a bill lets say a Bank of America credit card and they put it on your credit but at the same time hand it over to a debt collector. If the debt collector is ignored is it legal to sell it to another debt collector and can both debt collectors add it to your credit report even though Bank of america has already reported it as a closed account. Was just curious as if that is legal and what people might know about it? Any help is appreciated but please leave a source of information. Thanks

It would read "You could receive $&%#*.00 if you were permanently disabled in 2008"  or your estate could receive $#&%@.00 if you died in 2008.      Now, I phoned them up and asked them outright, what would I really get if I became permanently disabled or died today and they won't say. They just say You could receive up to this amount.  Well I simply asked them what the secret is?  Why is it a secret whether I get it or not.  The notice doesn't say "I will get or receive this amount" It reads, you could receive this amount.  Why the secrets. Am I going to get it or not I asked them and apparently its a Secret because you can't get a straight answer from those people.       I think they know that when you die and they don't pay what they said you could receive, they know they won't be hearing from you so they are in the clear. No compliants from a dead Man.

I don't understand this why would they deduct it my tuition from my refund? isn't that like me paying my tuition 2 times? maybe i don't know what credit means. I didn't take out any loans so I payed this with my own money help!! should i just not enter my school info?

The A/C unit is stated in my lease that they will maintain it and has not worked since I moved into the place in November. I realized this in Jan and put in a written work order at the beginning of January. Also my dryer exhaust vent is clogged (safety hazard, in lease to fix as well) and I put in that first written work order in sometime in December. It is now the end of February and neither have been fixed. I have to allow a reasonable amount of time for the problems to be fixed. Have I done that? Next I will send a work order via certified mail. How long should I wait after that arrives? I have put in a total of 3 written work orders for the exhaust vent and 2 for the A/C unit. I am ready for legal action and know what to do, but am unsure of a "reasonable" amount of time. Looking to get opinions to form an idea of a reasonable amount of time. Oh and I live in Texas and have had 70+ degree weather for the past 2 weeks. Would be using the A/C if it worked. Thanks for your input!

I like the home, the neihborhood and all, but today I received a notice from the County treasury titled "Jackson County Notice of Forfeiture" And it says that the home is subject to forfeiture as of March 1st, 2009, and owner loses all redemption rights as of 3/31/09.    I like this house and would like to own it myself, however I cant get in touch with the owner due to renting through a management company. What recourse do I have as a renter? Is there anything I can do? Can I refuse to pay rent since I must now find another place to live? Will this have any legal ramifications on me or my credit? I am completely at a loss for what to do, and I havent found anything helpful online.

20090226090634AAWQdZK	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Bad apartment living situation has me hesitant to renew lease.?	So, my fiance and I just got over a crazy downstairs neighbor who used to listen for us to leave, then swing open the door and ask us a million questions all at once.  She would often stand in the way of our shared entrance and block our path outside so she could bug us and ask us a million questions.  She would knock, then come into our apartment and drive us nuts asking for beer, food, our wireless internet password.  Plus she was super paranoid and always accused us of wishing bad karma on her.  Eventually, her family actually sent her to a rehab facility - she told us they were concerned about her substance abuse and attempted an intervention.   Long story short, I am still pretty freaked about what happened, and am not so certain I am comfortable even having a shared entrance anymore.     My landlord is suddenly chomping at the bit to get us to renew our lease (which does not expire until 08/2009) and it is February 2009.        I am not sure I want to commit to living here another year and a half.  It's an extremely cute apartment and I would normally have no worries on staying....but the shared entrance with the crazy neighbor situation has me sort of uncertain.     Top it all off, landlord has not been able to get another tenant for the downstairs.  So, I have no idea if the next tenant will be normal or a repeat of the craziness we already experienced.        This is a small house with just two apartments in it.        Am I completely nuts to be concerned?  I just can't handle signing a legal document promising to stay somewhere where I've already had a hard time in.
20090226090703AAB6F1S	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	What's the difference between filing "Single" and "Head of Household"?	I'm currently divorced and I have 50/50 shared custody of my 7 year old daughter... my divorce agreement allows for me to claim my daughter on my taxes however.       In the past, (when I was married) I would file "Married" but separately; and I would file as "Head of Household"; for a better tax return and because there were other financial issues that we wanted only on her (my wife at the time) taxes.      Now that I'm divorced, should I still file as "Head of Household" or would I file as "Single"? Is there a huge difference?

20090226090804AAJjr7Y	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can I get a home loan with my salary?	I live in Wi and home prices are pretty low right now.   I was thinking about buying a house I saw that is a short sale.  It was only 125,000 and its a assessed at 180,000.  I thought this was a great deal!  Before i go looking for a realtor and a lender I thought maybe i don't make enough annually to qualify.  I make about 40,000 annually and I only have a car payment at 300.  I just got all my credit cards paid off.  I do have one bad thing on my credit.  I had a judgment in that past that is paid in full so im assuming that's really bad too!  Is this a dream I should forget about or do i have a chance?

20090226091502AAFzdZT	Business & Finance;Insurance	I want to have kids, but have no insurance?	I have only a personal policy and it doesn't cover pregnancy.  My hubby is self employed and has no employees.  I work for a company of 4 people, but 1 of them has severe health problems which would push group policy rates to extremes (over $1000/ mo).  I don't qualify for any government help because we make good money, but with all our investments, we don't have enough cash to have a kid if something went wrong and the bills racked up.  My hubby says I should get a job at a company with good insurance, but I make good money now and it is easy work and if I have kids, they will let me work from home.  I don't want to go into a high stress job just to get insurance.  Poor people can have as many kids as they want and the taxpayers pay for it, but that isn't an option for me.  What can I do?

20090226092003AAE9XJw	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Do I have any options in this Real Estate situation?	My husband and I put a slightly low offer on a pre-foreclosure house in early January.  We only had pre-approval paperwork from a previous property, but our RE agent said if it was too low that they would just counter.  We waited for some time (we were forewarned it could be lengthy).  In mid February we were informed that the property was going to highest bidder status and that we were to put in a new offer if we wanted to.  We did put in a new offer, over 10% over asking price, and the waiting began again.  Today, our RE agent informed us that the listing agent informed her that there are Sheriff's sale stickers on the property, slated for March 26th.  We don't know if our offer is still standing or if everything is down the drain at this point.  I can not seem to get any concrete answers from anyone involved, and would just like to know if it is possible for our offer to still go through or if Sheriff's sale is our only option (which we are not prepared for).  Our RE agent doesn't know.  Thanks in advance.
