MEOjwPCNaa	Gas gauges will do funny things like that. They also tend not to lower evenly (the needle may hang at one point for a while, then suddenly drop) because gas tanks are irregularly shaped, often being much wider at one cross-section than another. Visualize it and it makes sense.    Your safest bet is to try and not let it dip below a quarter-tank. A good idea is also to learn the average range of your car, either by a Google search or observation, and re-set your trip odometer every time you fill up. That way if your gas gauge sticks or otherwise fails, you can still estimate how much gas you have left based on how many miles you've traveled on that tank. I started doing this when I bought my first motorcycle (because most bikes don't have fuel gauges to begin with) and found it's a good thing to practice in my car as well.|`|nU84u2poaa	the float inside of the gas tank is going bad, it will have 2 be replaced to stop, my old pontiac done that

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	change the serpentine belt tensioner.|`|5aJ7t4hJaa	If I interpret your question correctly, you just recently bought and installed a new (serpentine?) belt for your vehicle's engine. And now when you first start your vehicle's engine up (on cold mornings) the belt squeals loudly for a few minutes?    When you installed the new belt, did you loosen and readjust the *belt tension pulley* and lock it tightly into the proper position so as to have a *firm* seating of the belt in *ALL* of the pulleys is has to operate?    I would advise that you 'hold off'' on spraying any *belt lubricant* materials onto your new belt until you *know* that you have the proper tension throughout all of the pulleys (especially the one on the front of the engine crank shaft) involved.|`|DV4xyeChaa	bad belt tensioner...replace if a shot of wd 40 or silicon spray doesn't do it|`|kati4sOaaa	its probably either a bad tensioner or bad bearing|`|VTv7zsfFaa	could be the clutch not getting enough lubrication. only other thing i can think of is the fan belt, check and see if there would be anything that would cause ware on it.|`|ksFD7EoSaa	Working at a dealership has taught me about the belt squeal problem. I've found that when the squeal takes place, the belt is slipping and actually leaving a coating of rubber on the pulley. If you look close, you will see what I am talking about. A wire brush attached to a drill will remove the coating and with proper tension on a new belt, the squeal will be gone. Spraying WD-40 on the belt only contributes to the slipping and creates this coating even worse. Been there, done that many times.|`|GC9Z34gxaa	It could be the alternator baring,or the baring of the pulley that adjust the belt.    good luck|`|gR6P6gaMaa	Probably the tensioner but for a quick fix that is harmless just start the car lift the hood and take a can of WD-40 and spray on the belt until it stops squeaking and it shouldn't squeak for a while.|`|cfCUExotaa	Which belt?  Alternator?  You re belt could be loose , or your alternator could be seazing up .   Try tightening it by adjusting the alternator pulley tension.  Not too much, you should be able to get atleast 1/2" deflection on the belt by pushing with youre thumb in the middle of the belt. If it still squeals something else is toast.          Probably the alternator is trying really hard to recharge an already weakly charged battery. The squeal is the belt slipping on the pulleys.

Any change in the outside diameter of the driving wheel tires will change the speedometer reading for that particular automobile: from a *false faster* for smaller diameter tires to a *false slower* for larger diameter tires,  And the *engine loading efficiency* will be adversely affected also!|`|IT6C417daa	Bigger tires will make your speedo read slower.|`|JFKPqQV1aa	slightly slower, but the conrol and grip will be better with bigger tyres.|`|JZP4dClVaa	ok almost all of the people that answered your question were wrong i have big tires on my truck and when my speedometer says im doing fifty mph. im actually doing almost sixty mph. so maybe some of the people that answered this question should maybe go back to physics. but lets say your doing thirty you will actually be doing about 35. the slower you go the less diffrence it will be. i used to have 16.5 on my truck to then i got 33 x 12. but by your tires being two inches bigger than mine you eill have to go just a little slower than i do.

If this was a "buy here, pay here" dealer, then they could have very well overcharged WAY more than book value on the car. They can also charge the maximum interest allowed on a loan.     To answer your main question, no, there is no return period on vehicles. No "3-day, 72-hour, 30-day, etc". Once you sign and drive off, it's yours.

8QMvsIfKaa	Alot of city cops (sherrifs) have slim jims, if not (lightly) pry the top edge of the door out and bend a thick coathanger from the out side to check the "fit" is close to the lock, leave a bend 3-6" from center, then bend a Z in it so it fits your hand and you can turn/ pull & get some leverage and keep trying. Some cars are a pain but I've yet to find one I couldn't get in. Sometimes you can pull the window trim right off and just make a small hook and grap the rod that connects the lock to the lock switch and unlock em that way.  If that doesn't work try grabbing the key with it from the other side. When you get it open, go get a magnetic key box and spare key for $5 at most and stash it under your car somewhere for next time.

MTF0Rz90aa	There are several reasons why to seemingly identical engines produce different power out put.  First the construction of the engines differ from manufacture to manufacture, the heads of the pistons, material of construction etc can vary widely.  Other things like valve timing, duration, exhaust resistance, turbo size, waist-gate construction also come in to it as well.  As far as the 0-62 mph is concerned, this is more down to the gearbox/final drive configuration than the engine. For example the S40 has a very short first gear, so you have a fast pull away but you have to change gear fairly quickly.  Ja.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Intake, exhaust, timing, cams, compression ratio, programming, turbocharger - this things and more are all variables that determine engine output.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Other factors. size of valves, lift and duration. Size of turbo. Inter-cooler. Audi is direct fuel injected, should be better for power and MPG's. All Euro cars have fuel systems and controllers made by the Bosch corporation. They should all be pretty similar. Also, models have different weights and gear ratios in transmissions. Are you comparing 2 cars that are BOTH automatics, or manuals??? Between the 2, I would take the Audi. Audi engineering is much more developed in other areas, like suspensions and quality control, than the Volvo. But the Volvo is just fine, too. Usually the Audi insurance is less due to the fact that they are safer and better in most crash tests. HP ratings sometimes are not tested the same way. I believe that the newer Audi has changeable valve lift, which should give best performance and fuel mileage. Real world driving is a lot different than the figures you read in books! Good Luck!|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Compression ratio.    Simple and easy.    Beyond that, actual computer control of the engine matters, a LOT.    Get three identical engines. Same size, pistons, everything.    Three different tunes of their computer.    Three different performance levels.    Think about it this way, if you want. Two guys. Both the same size, 5'10, and both 170lbs. Both in fair shape. One runs faster than the other. Happens all the time. Engines aren't much different. Size is only one TINY portion of the equation.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	actually different manufacturers use different technology. usually changing the piston size or stroke even different head configurations valve placement sizes etc, cam configuration , valve lift ,duration etc|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Tuning and the evolution of technology. Why do many production cars today have performance numbers that would make a race car driver from decades past blush? Engines didn't get bigger, we just got better at building them. Advances in design, higher-quality components, etc. etc. all allow you to milk more power out of a given displacement.    Keep in mind that a gasoline engine produces around 90% of its energy in the form of heat---which it doesn't use. So it's actually horribly inefficient, by definition. It's not too hard to make it a bit less horribly inefficient.    Also, both cars you're comparing are turbocharged. Simply changing the characteristics of the turbocharger (and altering the fuel delivery to match) will make a huge difference in performance. A turbocharger crams more air into a given engine, which allows you to cram in more fuel, which makes a bigger bang and a more powerful engine.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	The hp does not depend of the swept volume of the cylinders nearly as much as it does on the volumetric efficiency.  The more air and fuel combusted, the more hp.  in general.|`|JFKPqQV1aa	I hate to answer like this but er... the audi is better.   I mean to say that the Turbo fitted to it is pretty amazing. It's the same one as is produced by VW and the Diesel version is particularly potent. the quality of a turbo is VERY important. Hope this helps.|`|cfCUExotaa	Its got alot to do with valve timming and duration, I guess as thats the biggest bang for your buck.|`|Gifc1bYVaa	the volvo is diesel which usually puts out more horsepower than gas. the volvo also has a turbo to which helps put out more horsepower.|`|lQDwrNISaa	simple. buy race spec parts. race exhaust and inlet=more hp  race ignition/valves/cams=more hp  race spec turbo/intercooler=lots more hp  sod it just buy a racing car|`|ksFD7EoSaa	You said the magic word, when you said Turbo. This is a device that allows you to pump up the engine by means of boost. This is generated through the exhaust system and is controlled by means of a waste gate. If I set the boost at 8 lbs I would gain 30 plus horse power. If I set it at 25 lbs of boost I would gain in excess of 100 horse power. The difference is engine life, too much boost will shorten the life of a good engine. Look at a dual turbo Porsche, 6 cylinders and 460 Horse power yet only running 10 lbs of boost per turbo. The potential is awesome. Hope this Helps
2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Not a lot right now.  This is just my opinion, but it could go down to about $1.00 + tax (look up your own states taxes, okay?) and it would be stuck there.  It would be basically at "cost".  We have actually seen that in the last few months.      The cost of producing crude oil varies all over the place, but there's a big chunk of the world's capacity that is in the $30 a barrel range.  Oil can't go below $30 a barrel unless all that is shut down, and I don't think we're going to really do that.|`|ehJ45unqaa	Demand would go down, and supply would go up, creating a surplus. Forcing gas refineries to lower prices to sell more....to drive demand back up along will sell. It's supply and demand.

hoykolriaa	On many CD changers there is a reset button - you usually need a pen to activate it.     Still no joy - ensure the CD changer cable is pluged in properly by removing and re-inserting - reset again. There is every possibility that the cable  could have moved with being under the passenger seat.    If you've still no luck - the problem can either be with the cd changer OR the head unit. Again, check connections to head unit.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Very little you can do: Check the magazine is undamaged, use a torch to look into the changer to check for fluff, dust, paper, etc - use a vacuum to clean it.  If these both draw a blank, it's probably gonna mean a new changer unit.

RVMJ7Gmdaa	That's actually a pretty good price if the car is in solid running condition. The suggested Blue Book price for that car is between $5-6k so make sure to find out if there are any problems with the car to see why they're selling it so low. But obviously don't tell them you think it's a low price. I don't know of any cons with the car, the mid 90's Toyota's were pretty solid. I'd say it's a good, fun car for a beginning driver.|`|BqXSymxjaa	It sounds like a fair price considering the low miles, but take it to a mechanic and have it checked out before you buy it. There could be problems you can't see.|`|pS8A05NTaa	i'd offer 2,000 see what they say to that   TEST DRIVE FIRST|`|6dG8dELDaa	I think that's a good price.|`|mH4cQvOMaa	seems like a good price
Yq2CUhtYaa	Sure.    Do this:    1. Write up a contract. Make sure you include VERY specific instructions about payment dates, and what happens if those payments are missed. Get it notarized.    2. Include a clause that any damages to the vehicle, are the new owners responsibility, and DO NOT void the contract.    3. You keep the title, until final payment.    4. Cancel your insurance on the car.    5. If you want to give them the title, then yes, you can sign as a lienholder. A lienholder is anyone who owns an interest in the vehicle. That would be you.    Good luck.    People will tell you not to do this. But if you do it smartly, it's perfectly safe. Just cover yourself, before you hand over the keys.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Don't do it. There have been dozens, maybe hundreds, of horror stories on this board from people who have sold cars this way. It's usually something like the buyer wrecked the car after a couple of months and just turned in back to the seller -- or lost his job and stopped paying -- or doesn't like the car and wants his money back.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	If the buyer moves a thousand miles away and quits paying what are you going to do then ?  Don't finance it for a buyer.  He can borrow the money from a bank or finance company.  If they cannot trust him how can you trust him ?|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Are you a bank? Don't do it. You don't have the expertise to protect yourself legally and financially in this situation.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	There is a reason they want you to finance it. They probably  can't get the money from the bank. Don't do it. I would almost bet after a few payments you won't hear from them again. Then you have to legally try to get your money and that will cost you and cause you a big headache.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Run away from this deal!!! You do not want to be responsible for someone who obviously can't get a loan on his/her own. To me, this reeks of irresponsibility, and what would happen if their insurance isn't paid up, and they wreck the car and kill someone? Not a good scenario! There is a buyer out there for your car who can and will pay in full. Keep looking, and good luck.|`|d73f42e45da26234ef0896a9f715781caa	I wouldn't do it.    There's got to be someone else out there that has the money to buy your car.|`|sCLqPSUfaa	You CAN put yourself down as lienholder.    However, chances are you should NOT.    If the person was a good credit risk, they would not be asking or expecting you to do this.
1CVOHoapaa	The V5 is not proof of ownership of a vehicle but merely a record of the registered keeper. Logbook loans may be able to prove that you own the car and therefore still take the car. if you have made loan payments for the car to the person you bought it from or if the person you bought the car from provides a statement saying that you are the new owner.  If you manage to persuade logbook loans that your uncle is the registered keeper they may be able to prosecute you for fraud in that you will have signed a document stating that you are the owner.  At over 400% interest your best bet would be to borrow the money from elsewhere and clear the logbook loans. It is the less painful option than a fraud conviction!|`|WpjzrZNXaa	If you don't pay the repayments they can repossess the car at any time|`|hYuLibKXaa	never heard of log book loans what is it.

A worn out ballbearing creates often a clicking ticking cr cloncking sound when turning.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	Have you checked drive shafts. It could be coming from the engine or lack oil in the system.|`|gUaXZPYmaa	sounds like a wheel bearing. if its a cv it would be primarily when you turn or get louder when you turn. does the clicking get faster as you go? cause then it really sounds like a wheel bearing. but check out the cv boot, sometimes they rip and let all the lube out and cause the joint to go bad.|`|982bf15fed410e5a03ba2c25cd8e51feaa	Muffler?|`|H9RTbhKYaa	Don't quote me on this, but I think it has something to do with faulty ignition timing. You probably need a tune up.|`|cfCUExotaa	check your cv joints if you have em, the only jeep i am familiar with has universal joints though.    I believe the inner cv can click going straight    A bad wheel bearing can click too.    BTW if youre in park and rev it does the clicking speed up, if so its oil to the motor(valve noise)

RbsRpcIyaa	Can you turn the car over to the lender without hurting your credit? No.    If you turn the car back in, that's called a "voluntary repossession" and kills your credit the same as an involuntary one (tow truck, late night, etc) would. The car is sold at auction, and you're still liable to pay the difference between what it brings at auction and what you owe on the loan. This will be thousands on a newer car.     Since the market is so soft right now, you'll be very hard-pressed to find anyone that will pay you what you owe on the vehicle. I'm guessing that you don't have the cash to cover the difference in what you'd get for it versus what you owe, which is one reason why you're considering turning the car back over to the lender.    Honestly? Your only option is to tighten up your budget and try like heck to keep that loan current. Might not be what you want to hear, but anything else will be harmful.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Try and sell it outright to another person or try and find someone to pickup the payment and if you find someone then take that person to the lender so that they can apply for credit and change everything over.....|`|DV4xyeChaa	its a matter of math..the car is probably worth 28K maybe less....other than paying the whole thing...go to dealer and try to trade it for a 2000 dollar trade in...you probably will end up paying 6 or 7K for the 2K car but you get out sooner with credit ok....or just sell the car and pay difference...4K maybe or whatever it is.....man what a hard lesson...good luck...i always buy used or a discounted year old car and keep it past payoff.
AA12261615	a faulty temperature sensor will cause that too happen and it wont even throw a check engine light sometimes,i had one on my truck and it did this for a long time,after changing the temperature sensor it starts right up even in cold weather,they wont always throw a code for you to go by when they go bad,since you have changed all the crucial parts id try that,you don't have nothing to loose but the cost of the sensor,good luck.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	THERE COULD BE SEVERAL SIMPLE REASON. TO HEAVY TO START WITH. A 5W30 OR 5W40. THIS WILL GIVE EASIER STARTING UP IN LOW TEMPERS. THE SECOND HAS TO DO WITH THE TEMPER OF THE ENGINE. IT HAS GET UP OPERATION TEMPER AND GO IN TO CLOSE LOOP. OTHERWISE IT THE PLUGS TO WET TO BURN ALL THE FUEL IN THE SYSTEM. HAVE THE THERMOSTAT REPLACED TO A 195%. YOU CAN ALSO BLOCK SOME OF THE  IN COMING WITH A GRAIL BLANKET. YOU CAN ALSO INSTALL A OIL PAN HEATER ELECTRIC DIPSTICK TO KEEP OIL WARM.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	I would think about the air intake temp sensor is not functioning, or even the mass air meter is not working right, due to the cold weather.  Why I say Mass air, is if its cold, it may have a short in it then.|`|WXDyS90Naa	sure sounds like cam timing to me. Nothing should ignite starting fluid vapors in breather. if it is overhead cam, the timing belt probably skipped a tooth or two.|`|8QMvsIfKaa	Just go back to the basics, you may be trying too hard, try some HEAT additive in your your gas, cold weather causes moister in your tank. Doesn't make sense it runs fine in summer & not in winter, it's ghetto as can be but try blocking off your radiator with cardboard and see if that helps keep heat. I do that every winter to keep my 95 GMC van warm, just keep an eye on temp gage and if it works figure out how to get it in behind your grill so it ddoesn'tlook so bad. Could be any of the afore mentioned though, cold weather does bad things to electrical systems and everything for that matter.|`|5aJ7t4hJaa	Your question is *intriguing* and also *TOTALLY CONFUSING* (to me). You have a GMC Sonoma truck which has a 2.2 (?), *4 CYLINDER ENGINE* in it as it's source of mobility!  Right away, I start thinking *DIESEL*!  But, later on you talk about the destruction of the "plastic parts connecting between the air filter and the throttle body, caused by your injection of *starter fluid* into the intake of a carburetor and throttle control assembly. And, *then* I'm trying to visualize a gasoline engine assembly -- but -- only *4* CYLINDERS?!?    And then -- the farther I tried to 'work my way' through to some real *understanding* of what true problem you might have with *whatever it is* that you're dealing with, the more I became *convinced* that I JUST COULDN'T!  Sorry.|`|64ebfcf2c6828152d539c175ba0072fbaa	You might want to check the choke also sounds like she might be sticking in the open or closed postions. If it is an electric choke(which it probably is) check all the wiring for shorts.|`|uLLHFiT3aa	There is something wrong with the ignition timing. When your timing is off (over advanced ignition or the cam belt or chain is on wrong) the engine will kick back against the starter making it hard to start or can even brake the starter. You can also get back firing through intake manifold, especially on carbureted engines or when using starting fluid on fuel injected engines when the timing is too advanced. The hesitation you feel could be from the ignition timing not advancing as the engine accelerates. Check the computer controlled advance on a cold engine. You need a mechanic to hook up a computer to test while the truck is driven ( maybe on a chassis dynamometer ). If you or your mechanic has a computer scanner with live data recording and you can't drive with it attached. You can jack up the rear axle and test the timing and amount of advance while a helper accelerates in gear with the parking brake on just enough to put the engine under load. Because it only happens on a cold engine it's the ignition timing not the valve timing (cam belts don't slip back when the engine warms).|`|Bl9zcqxQaa	All I can do without actually looking at your truck in person is give you my best opinion.   Since you "blew apart your intake" with starting fluid, right there you are telling me at the time of the no-start, it had plenty of spark.    I ran across a  problem close to your vehicle with my bosses k1500 chevy truck.   I would say you might just have a bad fuel pump. I know you said you checked the fuel pressure, BUT, did you check the fuel volume?      My bosses truck would  not start, it bogged intermittantly also.    The pressure coming from the pump was good until I checked the volume, it was under specs.    I changed the fuel pump and the trucks been running fine ever since.     Best of luck to you

c48nm70gaa	If you want above average results wheel your car into a wand - type car wash and let the entire *hot engine bay "have it" with high pressure hot soap while you feed quarters to the machine. Forget stinking foamy degreasers which leave crap all over your driveway and does a half a*sed job.    For any doubtors out there it will not crack any parts or cause the car not to start. I've been doing this myself for 45 years with no starting, rusting or corrosion issues. It will not cause old window type distributor cap point distributors not to start either.|`|ZBVMT11maa	check this website out   http://www.ehow.com/how_2046215_detail-e...    i use Simple Green works really good just make you cover up like your air filter and distrubutor. or whatever it depends on the car what you have to cover up|`|zotCYH89aa	If you live in a coastal area near salt air, leave it alone, it'll keep it from rusting. If not, try Gunk Foamy engine brite cleaner. It's the more gentle of the two types they make. Cover your distributer and air cleaner. Avoid spraying directly on your wire harnesses, connectors, etc.That's the big thing, you don't want to screw up the wiring harness by blasting it with pressure, steam, or harsh chemicals. Heat up the engine first BTW. If you live in an area where your storm drains are watershed areas, you can't do it at home or on the street, you can get serious fines AND you will eventually be drinking that **** out of the tap.|`|RUQprny9aa	I have used a pressure wash method before,           BUT DO NOT DO THIS WITH A HOT engine!!!    I am careful about where I aim the high pressure water stream, I stay away from the sparkplug wires, the distriutor (if your car has one) otherwise, I blast the motor where ever I can see it, the plastic stuff (as long as they do not directly open to the engine innards.  If you want to do this to the radiator/AC condenser, just be careful about mashing the cooling fins on it, try a corner first with a short spray and see if it stays unbent.  It Did make a difference on the turbo intercooler.|`|76cAAPfBaa	First of all, cleaning an engine like this MIGHT cause possible leaks of fluids, as the grease and dried dirt might be sealing it up. So realize that.     If you still want to do it, warm it up. Put on a good pair of safety goggles to protect your eyes. While keeping it running, spray it completely with a foaming engine cleaner, and let it soak a little. Keep it running the whole time (don't do this inside of a closed garage, or you might be hurt by carbon monoxide). Once it's soaked in cleaner for a bit, and is still running, then use the pressure washer very carefully to spray it. Do not do it with very high pressure however. This will clean it well.    The secret is to keep it running at the time you spray it, otherwise the sprayed water can get in places it shouldn't, and cause problems.

v77NR2WGaa	You might want to get a bumper upgrade that is rated for a Winch(get a Heavy Duty front bumper(aftermarket) that has a room for mounting a Winch on it).  The original bumper is too lightweight for a winch. The winch package will come with installation instructions and relay and wiring harness and it can tell you how to mount it.    other person said get a trailer hitch adapter but the problem is the hitch thing is also an aftermarket one(class 2 or class 3), do not try to use it on the rear bumper that has a ball on it (the rear bumper is also a class one hitch which is too lightweight for winch use,you will pull out the bumper the first time you use it)|`|2VCYL0F3aa	you can use a trailer hitch winch adapter or go to ttora.com lots of off road help there

2cbe1bba8389a009e6f7e731cb983e90aa	Those old northstars had crank sensors (there are two) problems but you still have to check with a scanner(special tool) to be sure. There is a onboard diagnostic system but it is hard to understand, I think you hold the warmer button and the off button on the climate control and it will start giving you trouble codes but you need a manual to tell you what the codes mean. shutting car off will get you out of trouble codes|`|FsT54qh1aa	Could be a bunch of things. The first thing I would do is buy some throttle body cleaner and blast the hell out of the throttle body while the engine is running....or take the throttle body off and hand clean it.

D6t6SoFRaa	A lot more than the new key.  Programming new keys will prevent the lost ones from starting the vehicle.

I would call a locksmith instead of paying to have the car towed the locksmith will come to you.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	What good would it do to "change the locks"?? you still have to buy keys with the new locks! And have them programmed. Does this car still have a real key? (that you put in the ignition and turn?) so many cars now have keyless entry and start. the Toyota dealer should be able to get the key number from the company and make a key to fit. Maybe they have a record of the program code too.|`|AA10137828	$150.00 to $250.00 per lock!    Don't forget the ignition lock as well.    New key would be a lot cheaper.|`|K8tyHC5Zaa	the ignition switch with key can be purchased at your local parts store for about $15.00. a repair shop will charge you on average $50-100 to install, the steering wheel & inner horn mechanism must be removed & requires specific tools. you can do this yourself if you are determined & mechanicly adept. a haynes manual shows this in detail, pick one up at your parts store, very handy. a lock smith can rekey your door locks for about $20-30 per door.  ~i found this on another site, i hope it's helpful
l80bH2TYaa	The tires you put on this truck will have nothing to do with the way the engine runs.However, if you went with a drastically larger tire, it will take more power to turn these tires.
VC7PyH53aa	Have them check the fuel and air filters. Probably need replacing.   Dirty and/or clogged filters can reduce mpg.     Also, when you park your car put a white sheet under the rear section to see if any fuel is leaking. Check it when the car is running too.  Also check in the engine compartment for any fluid puddles on the engine in case you have a small fuel leak.     In the  winter the re-blended fuels may be contributing to mpg loss.   I'm in the mid-atlantic US and during the winter I loss about 2-3 mpg due to gas blends and colder weather.     Also on the temp. gauge I had the same thing happen in my Acura integra. The temp reading was always low unless it was 100+ outside.   I believe it was caused when I had the timing belt replaced. They replaced the water pump and thermostat and probably used a different thermostat. Other than the low reading it was not a problem.|`|1SnI86BIaa	change plugs/posibly wires  air filter  oil/filter change  fuel filter|`|TsJoADGPaa	Have them first check your thermostat. When they fail, they are designed to fail open so as not to overheat your engine. But this also has the effect of having too much coolant passing though all the time.    You should probably have your air filter, spark plugs, and fuel filters changed since all of these can affect gas mileage.     Your mechanic may find other issues as well, but if you don't trust him, bring it somewhere else after and see what they find. If both mechanics agree, you probably have an accurate diagnosis.|`|lkX7ZB8aaa	u should have done more to ur car. change spark plugs, air filter, sea foam it. ur kinda dumb for not doing that before. regular maintenance is very important|`|gUaXZPYmaa	winters make cars run lean when they first start up, that me be what your smelling. also id recommend you to check your tire pressure, that can easily make your mpg drop. also when air filters are really dirty itll cause your mpg to drop aswell. it may be a bigger problem, do u feel any loss in power? because if so it may be another cause.|`|cfCUExotaa	What kind of exhaust work? Was the cat changed? could be getting blocked.  The fuel injectors may be dirty/worn.  Also maybe an o2 sensor.
r1D9P4Vyaa	If you hooked up properly to the Class three portion of the trailer hitch, used a 4-inch snap strap, tighten the strap by pulling away from each other. (All this with the truck in 4-Wheel Drive LOW Gear) all should be good. But I can tell you now there is no need to, Unless you would enjoy doing laps around the parking lot Dragging that F150 behind you.  Because IT WILL be the one doing the dragging, NOT the one being dragged. I will put Money on this one!!  The Powerstroke out weighs and torques the little F-150!  Hook-em up! Just do not have slack in the strap b-4 you start dragging him.|`|78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	Use a short chain in case it has a weak link and breaks.  No other damage to your truck that I can foresee.  The only damage I can see coming up shortly is your friend's ego, lol.  You can drag him around the parking lot sideways, no problem.  I would do it myself, just to knock him back a few notches.  Put it in 4x4 low, and I might stop before I hit the county line.  He has no common sense.  It would be a short battle with you the winner.|`|tL8k0ls8aa	Dude, huge mistake not only will you tear up your tansmission and you hitch the likelyhood the chain may slip off break and swing or snap back at your truck is also i huge possability, not a good idea, and yes you would pull him around if your transmission dont fall out first.|`|lIxEKA1xaa	well you should be fine. if the truck comes with a tranny temp gauge. i would just keep an eye on it. cuz if your pulling him for an extended amount oif time the temp would climb. but your truck can easily handle towing large trailers for days, and would be still good. the hitch will be good if its a class 3 type. and you got a nice truck to pull him around the parking lot. so u can easily beat him. if anything i would more conserned about his truck falling apart then you own.   DIESEL ALL THE WAY|`|0TVenxJyaa	If that chain snaps, not only will you damage your truck, quite possibly yourself as well as it takes out your rear window. Yes your blood is red in color...... Do yourself and you family a huge favor by not attempting this, the 250 will definitely drag the 150 around like a toy.|`|kvGHnEHjaa	Sounds like you need a hobby. you obviously have the internet, find something that won't end up costing you a fortune in trans, tires, differentials and body work.|`|PNSbG9FIaa	well it really should not hurt anything if you hook it to the right place but if you trailer hitch is on your bumper find another place you might have trouble if his has a granny gear but then you should still drag it so but i really dont think it hurt anything. And your tranny'll be fine
8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	My wife drives one, it is a great car. We have a 2008 AWD SEL with 20,000 miles on it. It has not had to go into the shop once! It has been flawless. It averages about 21mpg in mixed driving, which isn't bad for an AWD vehicle of that size. The power is good, the Ford 3.5L really is a gem of an engine. I am 6'4" and it has a lot of leg room in the front and back seats. I can sit comfortably in the back seat with the front seat all the way back! It has more passenger room than my mom's Explorer, but less cargo room behind the seats. It handles snow nicely, we had 8 inches on the ground once and the Edge didn't stuggle one bit. If you want a 5-passenger CUV, I would feel confident recommending the Edge.|`|SS67T3dOaa	Before buying a car, it's always good to get the vin number of that car, then call an insurance company to find out how much the insurance will actually cost you. That would make your decision much more easier. You can get a vin number from the dealerships website.|`|AA12225723	I have one, I think it suits my purpose pretty good.  Its kind of small if you are going to be hauling anything.  It has a narrow wheelbase and for an unsteady driver it can veer with you and catch you off guard, otherwise its economical, cheaper than a full size truck, and I don't have no regrets buying mine.|`|8vZLXB3Saa	They are pricey for what you get, but they are a sharp looking vehicle.  Watch for mpg tho, you will be lucky to get 24 hwy.    If you like the Edge, take a look at the Mazda CX-7.  Basically the same vehicle, but I think the Mazda has a nicer interior and is a little better looking if you like the sleeker styling.|`|dCuWCbRkaa	We looked at one, and at the time, it didn't seem like the perfect vehicle for us.  The towing capabilites were attractive for a utility trailer, but for a family of five it wouldn't have been great on long road trips.  We opted for a Freestyle, but anyways that's aside from the point.    Going down the highway, when I'm not driving I usually just observe what other people drive.  Aside from trucks, the Edge is probably largest volume vehicle that I see.  They are really stylish and have nice features like Microsoft SYNC and a vista roof.  I don't hear or read about them not being reliable, so they must be built well too.    Good choice of a vehicle, and good luck finding the perfect one.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	lol every FORD is crap....EVERY FORD! haha if you want lots of problems and want your car to spend most of its time in the shop buy a ford.....lol a ford pshhhhhh

vGxr9e59aa	Most likely, it's the thick film ignition module, mounted on the back side of the distributor.  I've had a couple of them quit on me in a 1986 Ranger -- one completely dead, another became intermittent.  As I recall, I once parked it in my garage in the evening, engine running fine; the next morning when I tried to start it, it was dead.  There was a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. against Ford Motor Company about 10 years ago regarding these parts.    Unfortunately, this is a Ford OEM part, and may not be available from any other sources.  It is tied directly into the EEC-IV computer and controls the current to the ignition coil.  Also unfortunate, Ford chose to mount this electronic module on the hot distributor housing, at the back end of the engine, so it has to function in a hellishly hot environment.  GM was smarter, mounting their electronic ignition modules on the firewall or side of the engine compartment.|`|0TVenxJyaa	Geez Loiuse 2nd  'answerer' you want this person to test/replace the starter relay when the motor cranks over already??|`|LjTUpYpLaa	Try replacing the stater relay by the battery. Usually mounted on the fender well in between the battery and starter. You can test this by bypassing it. Take a pair of non insulated pliers and connect to both posts on the relay.     The symptoms for this part not working. Nothing electrical will work or just barely works. engine will not turn over and there will be a clicking sound. It will be loud enough to hear with the hood up and the sound will come from that general direction.    Good luck.
WwXrTQgaaa	I don't know wtf a 5r55 is but they're really no different than any other V8 of comparable years. Keep oil changed (easy), keep air filter clean (easy), plug change every 70k miles or so (same as any vehicle), etc. Nothing really strange about them. They do have individual coil packs and if one goes bad it can be hard to pinpoint, but the Mustang's computer is pretty good at telling you which one is going bad so I wouldn't worry too much about that either.    Decent car, good engine for what it is. No worries really.    There are also many Mustang forums you can go to and get help, such as mustangs.net.    Ignore Ford bashers, or anyone else that bashes any brand specifically.

dDSuBQURaa	I think that is a bit expensive for a car over 10 years old. You need to check on how the engine runs and any problems--minor or major.

AA12261615	working on a dodge isn't much different than any other car,they function the same,start off by checking the thermostat and then the water pump and if you can borrow a pressure tester run a pressure test on the cooling system it may be a blown head gasket causing this too happen,older model ones was real popular for blowing head gaskets because the cooling fans would stop working on them once that happened they had no other choice but to blow a hose or a head gasket,good luck with it.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Check the cooling fans too, as they are electric.|`|d7cb6fc27f98aeb1e367c88593a8147eaa	As he said above check the cooling fans and the conections to it.

Nyzb6cLraa	First of all, I used to drive a 2000 Ford Taurus and I wouldn't pay that much. I bought mine in 2005 from a dealer and paid 5000 for it with all new brakes, tires, and mechanical work (tuneup, alignment etc.)    Yes it has 44,000 miles but the car is 8 years old and you might want to check to see why it has so few miles on it. If it's been sitting a while then you would have to check to make sure the battery is still good and none of the hoses have dry rotted as well as the multitude of other problems that can come with a sitting car.     You also might want to figure out the model type, different models come with different features such as a CD player and sunroof, etc. That would affect the price as well.     I checked kbb.com and the prices they gave me were   excellent condition: 3400   good condition: 3000  fair condition: 2650    because it's a Taurus and I know the problems I had with mine as well as other people with similar years I would say  1) Buy a more reliable car  or  2) Don't pay more than 2500 because it's going to have some real problems really soon more than likely|`|FTHswQIKaa	Try and post it on ValueJockey.com.

zruhNGKbaa	GMC is the make.  I suspect that the key here is "Damp Weather".      I assume it will crank but not fire up based on reading between the lines of your question.     I suspect that this is an older truck which means that it has a HEI distributor which are famous for a) burned through rotors ( you actually can not see a hole but there is a path for the spark to sneak through ) so replace it. And they also have problems with carbon tracking of the distributor cap.      To help you get better answers to your automotive questions Be detailed and specific in your questions, always give the make, model and year, also give total mileage, stick or automatic, carbureted or fuel injected, and any other information which might apply to the situation, describe what the car is doing or not doing, again be specific, if it is a starting problem state whether the engine cranks or will not crank. If your car will not crank there is a very specific procedure to determine the cause and requires minimal tools to carry out.  And any steps you have taken to try to locate the problem.  If necessary there are several of us who are willing to provide clear and detailed instructions to perform any automotive service that a beginning mechanic with a little support can perform in their drive or garage.|`|085qYCdDaa	if if only dose it when it wet (damp or raining)check for a crack distributor cap, u did not say what year|`|DV4xyeChaa	what year?  wipe plug wires with wd 40 to start...if it has a cap/rotor look inside and replace if needed  and wipe out with wd40 if good..
sf3xfdACaa	I think some drivers are oblivious to their actions, and don't realize the effect they have on other road users. I myself drive buses for a living and we are advised to leave a gap in front "Not a large one" just in case the vehicle in front breaks down etc "Probably the same applies to wagons" etc. It's a shame ppl don't think too far ahead when driving their cars etc|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I see your point. Traffic lines get longer for that reason. But the reason people leave a gap is because if the car ahead stalls, then they'll still have enough room to go around. But I don't believe one car space is necessary, I think maybe 1/4 a car space or just enough to go around would be ok. When I see a car with a car space in front of them at a red light, there's usually going to be a car coming out of a gas station or someplace that's going to stick the noise of their car in their lane. This can also happen when a car in the next lane wants to move in your lane, if you leave a space, that leaves a opening to stick the front of their car in your lane.|`|5kVyZyGGaa	yeah the people above me are correct it makes it a lot safer. if you were a good driver you would know that.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	And are you unaware that the average light only delays people 2-3 minutes?    It's not that big of a deal. No where you are going, is so important that you can't wait a few minutes, until the light turns again.    Secondly, the buffer is out of safety. If you rear end that car, it's MUCH less likely that they'll hit the car in front of them.     So, chill out. I bet you're the type that also weaves through traffic, so you can be a space or two ahead of everyone else. Even though it doesn't decrease your travel time in the slightest.|`|maHZCMNiaa	I don't know how long you've been driving, but clearly you don't understand that a safe following distance is one-car length.

AA11823124	I have encountered this problem before and it was in the horn contacts in the steering wheel.

AA10788612	Be ready for the dealer to sit & wait for a check to clear. They probably won't do a credit card because it would likely to be refused anyway because of the amount. They also have to pay a certain percentage to use credit cards on their end also, so they probably won't.|`|AA11275863	Yes|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Absolutely. However, if you are using a credit card, many dealers will have to charge you more because the credit card company charges a % of the transaction and this eats away profits on a "skinny" deal. A personal check will be just fine. Good luck.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	You can buy a car with a check, but many dealerships will not allow you to take delivery until the check clears. If you work out the purchase price exactly, you can go to the bank and get a cashier's check, then go back and pay and everything is kosher.    Some dealerships take credit cards, some do not. My mother tried to buy her last car (which was about $20,000) on her credit card to get credit card rewards and they would only allow her to charge $5,000.

Also, if the overheating was serious, it's possible that there was a problem with the threads that engage the head bolts into the engine block.

2yrEjfmLaa	i agree with the bad bearings answer. It happens after alot of miles. They only show when warm because the cold oil is thick enough to fill the gap in worn parts.|`|uwRkw4vmaa	I hate to be the speller of doom, but sounds to me as if the bearings in the engine have got to much clearance from wear.  There is a chance that the sending unit for the oil light is defective.  In either case, when you come to a stop the engine slows down, the oil pump also slows down, and dose not make as much pressure, or produce as much volume.  Most sending units will close at about 4 psi. and as the pump slow, it can either not keep up with the need for pressure cased by the worn bearings, or because the sender is weak, it illuminates the light sooner than it was designed.  And as for the issue that dose not seem to exist when it is cold, the oil is thicker and holds better pressure.|`|ez5BjZdRaa	prolly bad oil pump, Looks like its not functioning properly at low RPMs. When you rev see if the pressure goes up, It is possible its a bad gauge, or the electrical system is being stupid.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	oil pump new oil and oil filter|`|EmgiGg17aa	Is idle speed may be too low.  If it is normal speed(or close to) and the weight of the oil is 10W30 and you can't get any oil pressure - you either have a faulty oil pressure guage (that happens) or your oil pickup is not picking up any oil(meaning your oil pump is history) meaning the engine needs an overhaul yesterday.  No oil pressure and it will seize.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Oil pressure always is lowest at idle with a warm engine.  That's just how it works.  The more revs you are pulling the higher the oil pressure.  The oil pump is probably driven off the crank on this engine so the higher the RPM the faster the pump spins and the more oil pressure you havee.  At idle the engine will be lightly loaded and does not require a lot of oil pressure.|`|uKCndxcEaa	There is a short somewhere, this happens in older cars|`|CJJGRzQkaa	May be the oil pressure sending unit. or just the oil pressure sensor is shorting out.|`|FMzRsb4faa	it is not your oil pump or else your engine would be fried and or you would here valves ticking but if you are hearing those sounds from your engine then yes it is your oil pump. In this situation if all is running fine then all it is is your oil pressure sending unit.
AXNkmdbKaa	I would loosen the starter mounting bolts and pry it around a little.  If it is stuck in the flywheel it should come loose.  It may also be in pieces as they tend to do that also.  In that case, it will probably fall apart when you pry on it.  In any case, do not try to start the engine with the starter loose.  Tighten it back on or take it off before proceeding to replacement or cranking, whichever seems appropriate.

HFrsH9MRaa	It depends on what kind of car, year, make, model, engine size, condition it's in, mileage. Most modern cars never need spark pplug wires, unless they were broken or corroded through. Most modern engines need only spark plug replacement. However, that is not all there is to a tune-up. Today, most engines have idle air control valves. These need to be cleaned.  So does the throttle body and PCV valve and hose. Some engines require a valve adjustment. Most owner;s never have this done, which is foolish. Engines wear faster and you lose power and economy. Obviously, the more cylinders the car has, the more the tune-up costs. If you purchase a Haynes manual specific to your car, you can do most things yourself. Good Luck!|`|mKVFIklaaa	This seems to be an American phenomenon: There's nothing you can 'tune up' on a modern car, they are generally serviced to the manufacturer's schedule (spark plugs, oil, oil filter & air filter changed) and everything else pretty much is adjustment & lubrication of bits & pieces around the car.   cars used to have to have running adjustments made to keep them in good working order, but these adjustments ust aren't possible on a newer car (points, carburettor, timing etc)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it depends on the car. usually plugs, plug wires, check all hoses and belts, clean the throttle body ( if it,s fuel injected) change the pcv valve, air filter, gas filter, check all fluids. there are a few things for you.|`|fdTgA1Svaa	Depends on the year of the car and what u actually want done to it.

NzIoJlNUaa	One 2ohm DVC sub can only be wired to 1ohm or 4ohms.  So if you have two subs you will need an amp that puts out the correct wattge at a 0.5ohm or 2ohms.|`|AA11318686	if you've got 2 subs that are dual 2 ohm voice coils you can wire them to 2 ohms or 0.5 ohms and since you can't wire a hifonics amp down to 0.5 ohms you're going to have to wire them to 2 ohms but that will mean the amp is only putting out 400w per sub and that's no where near enough for a pair of Fi bl's|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I seriously doubt that the difference between 1 Ohm and 1.33 Ohm would have a significant influence on an amplifier's output impedance.  Total impedance changes can be made on two or more subs depending on how they are wired - the impedance(s) of a single sub (including a duel coil) is a characteristic of the sub and is not user changeable.|`|QQbbReRAaa	Yeah, the way you wire the two speakers together affects impedance. Check out examples here http://caraudio.biggz.com/parallelseries...  With your new amp you buy, make sure you wire the speakers appropriately in relation to the output impedance of the new amp. The higher the impedance of the two speakers, the lower the volume, but the tighter the bass

dRozk0cCaa	the head unit really doesn't matter just as long as it has an rca output for the sub thats really about it. stereo to go with eclipse cause it has a 5v outputs on the radio. but if you don't like eclipse, try out pioneer, sony, alpine, kenwood. don't go with jensen, phase linear, dual, xo vision these are crappy brands|`|BeY1ujJpaa	And major brand with a build in sub control! you want one with 3 sets of RCAs front, rear and sub    rockford or pioneer are excellent!|`|jcwLY9DOaa	well i like JVC  but your going to need an amp to put on that subb
hnhb119Laa	You usually have several options at the end of the lease, which the lease company will discuss with you.  They will always provide you with a buy out price, and will sometimes also offer an option to extend the lease.  The buy out price (aka the "residual") can be specified in the lease agreement up front, or can be market-based (that is, a price you negotiate with them).|`|bAKiEh3Laa	Different dealers have different options. Ask the dealer.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Yes. Your lease contract specifies the lease-end purchase price, which can often be negotiated. And it's the lease company that you buy from, not the dealer.

Remember to negotiate just like you would if you were buying a new or used car.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	yes you can|`|AA10622097	Yes, that is the point of a lease, you can either turn it in or purchase it by paying or financing the balance.|`|8iYVHA1raa	Yes - The purchase price should be written into the lease papers you originally signed - You should have a copy of those to find the price they will charge you.     Honestly though, it would probably be a better deal to purchase a new vehicle  that has a full warranty etc than to purchase your already used one as the price of purchasing at the end of the lease isn't that great in my experience.|`|ed05090e60ffb81604e4d4052b697bd6aa	You can but you end up paying a few thousand more for the car than if you were to have just bought it in the first place.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Of course.  they would love to sell it to you.

But going by your question i dont think you should be attemting to re build an engine just yet.  Go to you local library and get some reading material on basic engines and engine maintenance.

X6BNLeh0aa	Search eBay and/or craigslist. Get the information from the tire on what size you will need.    If you want a brand new one then go to a Toyota Dealer, then go to the parts department. Plan on spending about $100 at the dealer.
Nyzb6cLraa	hondarepairables.com    It's a business run out of Battle Creek, MI    They should find you a cheap reliable car. I bought mine for 989 after fees and it is amazing. It's a 97 Honda Del Sol. It runs great. I absolutely love it. At a dealership or from a private seller, I would have bought it for 3000 at least.    It isn't just Hondas and they buy through dealer auctions. That is where dealerships take cars that aren't selling on their lots and auction them off to other dealers. That way you can get them cheaper.

kOCtAVXwaa	Hello Sir.    The 1.8t and 2.7t engines are very strong in there design.  The usual turbo upgrade would be what is found on the euro uprated version from the factory.  This turbo would be called a KO4.  Yours comes factory with a KO3, the next one smaller.  You may also up it to the whole next level which would be a custom ball bearing turbo, perhaps a gt2835rs.  This is still a quick spooling turbo, and should get you in the 350hp range, which is a decent amount of power for the 1.8t.  I would imagine this is close to the limit using stock headgasket, internals, and springs.      I was running 25psi on stock internals on a 2.7t, so I would think similar is okay for the 1.8t I know you can run 20psi no problem.  One thing to keep in mind is the ball bearing turbos will require a custom header, which the "KO" series turbos will bolt right up...    Dont forget proper tuning, intake, and exhaust.  Probably a clutch too once your making all that power.      Im an Audi tuner and enthusiast.  You already made the best choice for a brand of a car, now your on your way to make it fast!  Good luck, and have fun.  Once you see 20psi on your boost gauge you will be what I call addicted!

Call a dealer and get a price (likely to be the highest).  Call a national chain like Pep Boys or a Firestone store and get a  price.  Finally, call a local mechanic and get a price.  Ask about parts brand and warranty.  This shouldn't take over 1/2 hour of your time and you could save hundreds!  Hope this helps!

RCUrb6L0aa	How do you know that it doesn't have these features. ABS will kick in when you slam on the brakes at a high speed and traction control will kick in when you take a corner too fast. Have you ever placed the car in this situation? Your brakes would pulse when either of these safety features are activated and you would feel it through your brake pedal.     I haven't heard of a post 2000 model year car of any manufacturer not having ABS as a standard feature. It would be like Saturn not installing seat belts. If these systems don't work, it could be something simple like a blown fuse. You're covered under CPO so you can take it in if it is not working.      Edit:    I finally got the Edmund's website to work. It wasn't working earlier when I wrote my original response. It does say ABS and Traction Control is optional for your car.     I've heard a carfax report should tell you what features this car was equip with when it left the factory. These two components are factory installations and I doubt that the dealer will be able to install them especially on a used car to rectify a misprint on the sticker. More than likely, you can argue for a refund on the two missing components.     Good Luck|`|AA10874752	It has ABS, and Tration control.

AA12020975	This sounds like a problem i had once. I changed the battery & alternator. The problem turned out to be the positive+ battery cable.

0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	I have owned a Subaru Impreza, and my brother has owned a honda Civic. In my opinion the Impreza blows the Honda away in several areas.  First off, power. You have power in the Impreza that the Civic has never known. Immediate, turbo charged power.   Secondly, the Impreza is all-wheel drive. And that is HUGE. Not only does that make it safer to drive, especially in extreme weather conditions, but it makes the car a better steering car, particularly around corners and most importantly, in snow and ice!!  Thirdly, yes, the Civic gets better gas mileage, but a few cents at the pump does not make up for the lack of all wheel drive and turbo charged power.  Fourthly, like the Civic, the Impreza, is also a Consumer Reports Best Buy purchase. You lose nothing in the reliability and customer satisfaction areas to the Civic.   And fifthly, FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, that's right, the Impreza is a HOOT to drive! Find a nice curvy road, with no lights, and VROOOOM!!! It's like driving in the Indy 500!! This car rocks on the pavement and through the turns. A few simple upgrades, and your Impreza can become an all out sports car! That's something that would require a TON of money in the Civic, because you'd have to buy a turbo to match the performance of the Impreza.   And there is NOTHING more boring than driving zero-fun-factor automobile. For that much money, you should have the option of actually enjoying the ride, and trust me, with the Impreza, you'll arrive at your destination with a grin from EAR-TO-EAR every single time!    Ok then! Peace!!!!|`|PRx6j6YQaa	i own a Subaru chose it over a Honda after two years still love the Subaru|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Subaru.    1. AWD means safer in snow and rain.  2.

7H7cXTvGaa	1. You have asked the question in the wrong section.    2. Mumbai is a very expensive city to live. A dormitory type, non-air condition (foreign nations will find the humid hot climate in Mumbai extremely uncomfortable) bed, with common bathroom will cost approximately 350 INR or 7-8 USD per night/24 hours. A double room with enough space for 2 beds and some space to stand up while dressing is going to set you back by nothing less than 1200 INR per night.     3. Hospitals like TMH would have extra beds for persons accompanying patients. You may be better off contacting the hospital direct. You are not likely to be the first non-local person taking treatment there. The hospital authorities may have (probably non-official / personal contacts) with individuals providing serviced apartments / home stays / paying guest type accomodation near the hospital. Remember that road traffic in Mumbai is very congested, and it is very un-economical (in terms of time taken to travel) for even short distances like 1.5KM.
