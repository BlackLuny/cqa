20090309173443AACf7Vi	Environment;Global Warming	Why do people believe in the "Global Warming" propaganda scheme?	So obviously our planet is going through a warming right now, so global warming, if that's what you'd like to call it, does exist.   But this belief that the politicians and media are cramming down our throats, about CO2 and humans causing this warming is absolutely absurd.  Any scientist that isn't specifically funded by this craziness will tell you how absurd it is.   I think it's great that people are trying to conserve energy and be nicer to the Earth.  But are scare tactics dressed up in theatrics the way to get people to be more eco-friendly?  When will we dump this illusion and just take responsibility for doing good deeds ourselves?

20090309205857AAxrqu4	Environment;Green Living	Are light bulbs recycled into vases a health concern?	 http://www.care2.com/greenliving/recycle...       Here is some more info, this is what some ppl said on the forum      PERSON #1 Not only mercury but osmium and tungsten are used in bulb filaments. Please be very careful and remember to dispose of these dangerous heavy metals carefully. Osmium gives of a toxic vapour in certain conditions.      PERSON #2   It's only the new type of fluro's that contain mercury, not the old incandenscent bulbs.   I think they'd also look great half filled with wax and used as hanging candles.      PERSON #3    As stated... there is no mercury in any of these "old style" bulbs, and unless you are eating huge quantities of it, there is nothing wrong with touching tungsten. It is simply a metal. Osmium in it's pure state reacts with oxygen and is highly toxic. Fortunately it has not been used in incandescent bulb filaments since around 1906 after tungsten was found to be more efficient. The glass may be dangerous around children though.   Very creative.   This is a very creative way to use old bulbs.      Also, most of my lightbulbs are not clear like that, they have a white layer over them, what is the layer, anything toxic, that I shouldn't scrape off?
