When ive done something wrong or someone has raised their voice at me, is when my thoughts of wanting to die are strongest. Please, help me.

20090304154539AAJHiA6	Health;Mental Health	Can't take this life anymore. HELP ME Please?	It all started about 7 months ago i was in school and got a horrible smell that im glad only my guy Friends could smell at and all boys table. We all thought it was a girl smelling like that. (so you know what smell im talking about (FISH) ). Now wait a minute im a guy and i thought it was a girl but when i went to the bathroom to do my stuff a big blow of fish blew right out of my pants and i said "WTF that was me". So i went back in class not saying anything playing it off and think good the next day i did not smell like that but i have another smell that is staying with me and i don't know what to do about it. It's making me depressed and paranoid and stressed out and im failing classes and i keep getting fussed out by my mom because im trying to wash this damn smell of every time i get making the water bill high. I used antiperspirant deodorants and anti bacteria soaps and none of this stuff is working. I eat the same stuff i was eating when this was not happening and NOW i can't take this life any more. THE Odor has spread all over my body now and i can't stop sweating no matter how cold it is today it was around 20 and im sweating outside WHY did god have to do this to me what did i do. Im thinking about going to the air force because i don't want to go to college or have a job where people tease me or something. Im only 15 in the 10th grade and my life feels like it's ending i can't even talk to girls anymore and i have had two doctors appointments but they got canceled and now i have a new doctor. What if she hot and i have to tell her all this. I sit next to a pretty girl i used to talk to and she keeps covering her nose when i sit next to her and we don't even talk no more i walked in front of some people in the hallway and they said what is that smell? This is a everyday problem that won't go away. WHY GOD? WHAT DO I DO? IM LOST

20090304154824AAxelXf	Health;Other - Health	Am I an alcoholic? Please give me some feedback....?	Okay....so. In a nutshell...I'm a party girl, I love to be social and go out on the town. I have been partying since I was about 16 but not in excessive amounts like a lot of people my age do (I am 21). It does not get in the way of my school, work, or anything else....or RARELY anyway. I am pretty good at keeping my priorities straight and only drinking when I know I can afford to be hungover. My question is...am I an alcoholic?? Out of all the bad things that I have happened in my life in the past 5 years...I would say about 90 percent of it has been a result of alcohol. and it's a cycle...I will be so remorseful, have terrible anxiety, say I am never going to drink again....and then try to set limits for myself. I will stick to the limits 1-2 times and then I think I have a handle on it and forget all about em. Alcohol problems run in my family...my grandpa was an alcoholic and my 24 year old sister has had problems and now has been sober for over a year. I know the answer may seem obvious...QUIT drinking...but I don't consider myself an addict at all. I don't really CRAVE the alcohol that I notice. My mom says that I obviously have a problem if bad things keep happening while I am under the influence but I continue to drink. It causes a lot of stress in my life and I really do have an outgoing personallity and don't NEED to drink, its just hard because I JUST turned 21 and I live in a small town where drinking is the center of everyone's lives. On a good note, I am moving to las vegas here in about 2 months (which seems like it could be a LOT of trouble for me) but I am really thinking hard about making the conscious decision to NOT drink anymore because in vegas, I could get into some real dangerous situations if I drink. I am way too trusting of people, it's a character flaw I guess. Plus I think it will be easier there to NOT drink. people here think you are crazy if you don't drink. Any comments/ suggestions/ feedback on how I should go about doing this and/or if YOU think I have a serious problem or not...would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks!

I always know that my mom is coming to pick me up from school, and that is usually when I start feeling sad. I also start to have urges to self mutilate, and I think about everything wrong in my life (which is wayy more than the average, "This girl doesn't like me. Why does everyone hate me!!!??" kind of crap. It's cutting, health of my family, friends leaving without saying goodbye, dropping grades, loss of sleep, loss of desire to eat when required, etc.) which just starts to scare me, and I just want to break down.

20090304154908AAb4RSL	Health;Mental Health	My mom went off her  medication?	My mom has severe depression, she's had it for as long as I can remember. She didn't go to college, married and divorced, never had a surplus of money, etc. She talks to herself out loud like an old crazy woman would, cries all the time, even talks about suicide, sometimes to me.   She has been on and off with depression medication. It gives her bad side affects, she is only 76 pounds, with lots of issues and can't handle a lot of side affects.      Her problems are not as bad as she makes them seem, because I live with her and know about all of them. We have always had money, and a house, and everything else.  More then most others.      She was on bi polar medication even tho she does not have the disorder, and the medicine helped her so much, but it gave her the worst side affects. She did stop the crazy talk and crying tho. She went off it two weeks ago without me knowing, and has the same depression symptoms again. I called her doctor, and she got angry with me for doing so.       She told me she is not going to go back on medication. I can't take this. I'm 19, I should not have to listen to this, nor make sure she does not kill herself. What can I do.

It is very freeing and is the only way i feel good about myself, but it is SO hard to maintain as i sometimes get very fatigued. I don't know if i am asking for help to stop the eating disorder, or asking how i can maintain it, because I know i will not be able to live this way forever, but i just cannot stand the thought of gaining weight. I need a new mentality or something, because i really don't think this will ever go away.

20090304160559AADNM3k	Health;Women's Health	Delayed Period - Do you think I'm Pregnant or can it maybe be...stress or medicine?	I've had a delayed period (or so I think). I'm normally irregular, meaning I don't get my periods on the same day as the last month and etc, but I still get worried nevertheless. Okay so when I have sex with my boyfriend, we use a condom of course. He likes to be extra safe so when he knows he's about to ***, he pulls out EVEN THOUGH he has a condom (so he doesn't tell himself "oh its alright i'll be safe already". And then even after this, he still goes to the restroom to wash out the condom and fill it up with water to see if the condom had any breaks in it. So yes, he's very safe (:       But anyhow, a while later, I had given him a handjob. I didn't wash my hands, but after about 4-6 hours or so, I had accidently touched the clit area (or just outside area of my vagina), so would there be a chance of me getting pregnant thru any of these?       I've tested negative two times, and I know emotional stress may delay period....so for this month, I've been crying for about a week over my dog who was given away to someone else :l And besides that, I may have gotten into a little misunderstanding with my boyfriend two times so I just felt a little depressed or cried for these times. Would this be enough to count as emotional stress? I also had a Yeast infection about two weeks ago and was prescribed medicine for 10 days, which I finished last Friday.       Help please? And sorry for long post. Thanks in advance!!

Hello   Around August last year (08) I had bottom right wisdom tooth removed, well top third of it removed, the roots were left there by the oral surgeon as they were all around the nerve and deemed too risky. I was told at the time that leaving roots shouldn't be a problem. However a dentist i saw today noticed something (i forget the name) where there's like a tiny 'tube' coming out of that wisdom tooth's gum area where he says an infection oozes itself out, and i should have the roots removed.  From what I've read on the web some people say leaving roots is no good, others day it's fine.  Does anyone know one way or the other please??  Is it worth removing at the big risk of permanent nerve damage?? or will infection just go away sooner or later?

Ok, so my boyfriend wants to go to MOA for his birthday, and said we would go on rides and stuff for the whole time, I am a person who gets sick REALLY easily and I don't know what to do.  I tried to get out of it, because he said he was going with other friends, so I thought I could stay behind, but he suggested to put it to another day.

I am 20 years old, and I looked in the mirror today and noticed a Whitish line running straight up and down on my front tooth and I immediately thought, "oh god ive got a crack in my tooth". I looked on my other front tooth and IT also has and identical line running straight up and down. I did some research on the matter, and found that it wasn't a crack it was a "craze" but it also says this happens with time, and its normal wear and tear. but it also said that its not a problem unless it runs into the gum line, which I think BOTH of them do...

20090306161803AAggWDE	Health;Women's Health	Why are some adolescents nowadays SO stupid!?	I'm 14 a year old girl. Most of the people in my class are 15 (almost 16). Almost all of them have lost their virginity with girls the same age as them. First of all, I think it's pretty stupid to sleep with someone when you are certainly not ready for the consequences! But the main reason I am so raging is because a boy in my class, let's call him Jon, has been sleeping with this girl for maybe 7 months now? I overheard him talking about how she thinks she might be pregnant.    He said 'She said if she is, then she wants to keep it. But if she isn't, she said I have to get her a kitten'. I think it's ludicrous that this girl can compare a baby to a kitten! Does she really think it's going to be that easy?! Like taking care of a kitten? .. But there's more. After that conversation, another boy asked Jon 'Would you cheat on her?' and he replied 'Probably.' and then laughed a bit. I just think it's so sad that girls can be so insecure or naive or whatever it is, that they would lose their virginity to someone who would cheat on them and who doesn't care about them. I don't know.. I just really needed to rant about this. What do you guys think? Do you agree or disagree? And why? Was your generation like this? And why is it? I think it has a lot to do with the media, television. But also the pressure that guys can put on girls. Also I would blame the parents for allowing their children to go out at the weekends on not come back till 6am in the morning and not even question where they've been or what they've been up to.      Sorry if I sound like a grumpy so-and-so, I'm just really frustrated with this.   Thanks.

I was on Lortab but when I was put on the Seboxan they took me off and now my right hip just aches day in and day out.  Anyone with any suggestions. SAnd no I was never addicted to pain killers in the past.  Thank you.

20090227082512AABRCmS	Health;Women's Health	I have a lingering pain in my right breast? what should i do? do i have to go and see the doctor?	i'm not having my period right now. usually, one week before my period comes, i'll have some pain in both my breast. i know it's common. my breast will be hard and very sensitive. but after my period, it's gone. i've been having that kind of pain since the first time i had my menstruation which is on 2001. i'm 19 now.      what that makes me worried is that last year there's been a discharge of fluid which is colorless and tastes like salt water on my left breast during my menses. so i consulted my neighbour who is a doctor. she examined both my breast for lumps and found none and she told me it's common. she told me that maybe i was very stressful that time so the discharge of water is possible.    but i've been notising that lately everytime i press my left breast a slight discharge of water comes out even when i'm not having my period. And today i'm having pain in my right breast. but there's no discharge of water from my right breast. the pain is on the area of my nipple and the surrounding part of it. i'm 19 years old now. what shall i do? i'm scared! Is it breast cancer? actually i tried examining my own breast but i can't differentiate the milk ducts in my breast for a lump? i wear a C cup bra. shall i go to see the doctor? is it possible that a 19 year old gets breast cancer? my family has no history of breast cancer.   so what do i have to do. I seriously need help. Please give me useful answers. Thank you

20090227083857AA7PAnl	Health;Mental Health	Still need help with obsession?	Hey Everyone. Sorry that this is so long, but it’s been bothering me and I have to get it off my chest, and see what people’s opinions are so hopefully I can put my mind to rest. Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)   She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,   More than half a year ago, I remembered this event and it started bothering me. Did this woman feel violated by my actions? Did I sexually assault someone? I became very harsh on myself and forgot to remember that it was a stupid thing I had done- but I didn’t force her to, and I would have stopped had she asked me to. I have been obsessive about the event and I am now taking meds for my depression. Though the meds have helped and my quality of life is returning, the questions still bother me - Is this woman alright? What if she had never kissed someone before and I violated that for her? Will I ever accept myself and be able to forgive myself and move on? I would never do something to hurt or violate another person, and I feel like I’ll never be able to fully forgive myself.   At the height of my depression I did not want to live and considered myself the worst, most vile scum on the planet, but I am starting to come around to realize I made an honest mistake and didn’t mean any harm

You all pretty much know by now that for the past 2-3 days I've been seeing TINY bright red dots in my underwear.  Lol for some reason I keep calling them "the evil red dots" lol.  But anyways...there's only been like 3-4 a day.  PLEASE reasure me, kind people!  Is that really spotting?  Or is it something else?  How many dots does it have to be to be considered spotting?  Since they're so tiny do they really count?!?!  I haven't gotten my first period yet.  And one more:      This morning when I checked my underwear, there was a patch of blood.  However, yesterday, I did chop off the tip of a mole "down there." It bled for a while, I cleaned it with an alcohol wipe and Neosporin (no Band-Aid...ouch!!!) and it scabbed over and I went to bed.  There wasn't any bleeding after I first cut it off.  And, since I was sleeping, my undies changed positions a lot, so there's no way to tell if it was near the discharge or not.  Was that my period, or was it the mole bleeding again?  They were just pencil sized dots of reddish-brown blood.       So, if you can reassure me on these questions, that would be wonderful!  Sorry to keep asking these questions...I'm just the kind of girl who wants to know what's about to happen.  If it helps any, here are the signs of my period I've had so far:   *13   *Mom got hers at 13   *About 120 lbs. (is that a good weight?  I'm about 5'5")   *Crampy   *Very emotional/moody lately   *Very very tender breasts   *Armpit hair for about a year   *Discharge for about 1 1/2 years   *The strip of fat on my lower abdomen seems very jigggly today..lol   *Very greasy face lately, more pimples popping up when I usually have almost none.   *Discharge amounts seem to be increasing   *And lastly, last night my lower abdomen was just, REALLY uncomfortable.        So.  There it is, PLEASE answer. I have school tomorrow and I want to know what I should expect.  Thanks a TON! =)
20090503131140AAkw81j	Health;Men's Health	What can I do about my son's penis problem?	What can I do about my son's penis problem?   My son is 19 and though I have not seen him nude since he was a boy, I had seen him by accident about 6 months ago, when he had somehow ended up falling asleep naked in his room after a shower with his door wide open. He was on his back and erect in his sleep. I noticed his hard-on had a severe curve upward. It was bent very sharply like curling up backwards. I had never seen anything like that on any man. It is about 7″ long approximately and is bent more toward the tip in a definite shape of a letter “j”, or a hook, to attempt to describe it to you.      I was so shocked that I panicked, and woke him up right then and there. Thinking back, it was not very tactful, but I could not wait to try to get at what appeared to be a real problem. It all made sense, how he would not shower at gym class, and didn’t date, despite being a very well built and handsome boy into sports always. I had always wondered if might be gay, though he denied it always. He awoke surprised and shy that he was naked, but I moved his hands from his erect penis, and asked him what was the matter.      We sat and talked after locking his bedroom door. He told me it had started when he was like 12 and got worse, and as I examined it more closely and attempted to straighten it out, it would straighten only very slightly before it would hurt him to force it any further. It being erect, it was very hard and stiff. We allowed it to subside by him putting on his robe a while, and was considerably more normal in the soft state, yet still tending to be curved upwards slightly.      I could straighten it easily while soft, but it would bend back up like rubber. As he became erect again it curled up before my eyes into the “j” hook shape.      Now the doctors all said he is fine and it’s normal as far as being a medical issue. They said they could operate to attempt to fix it, but the cost was out of my reach. I am a single parent. So we took trying our own methods, in which I would tell him to stroke it straight whenever he thought about it, and while masturbating to attempt to work the curl out a little more each time.      I had taken a little massage therapy classes in the past, and I even work on it for an hour or so 3 days of every week in the evening. It was embarrassing for us both in the beginning and I know it still it is, and even more so that he ejaculates every time during the massage, but it turned out to make massaging it in the post-ejaculation, semi-soft state really effective because then I can massage it and straighten it. It curls back in my hands and I massage it straight over and over again, until he becomes erect again and semi hard again after ejaculation, three times in a row, usually over a span of an hour to an hour and a half.      It has given good results, as I would say he is 50 percent improved. I continue to treat him 3 days a week.      I am here to ask anyone with information on this condition for advice and/or tips technics on how we can further correct this.      Thank you all in advance.

I've been going through a very stressful last few weeks, and about 5 days ago I started getting bad headaches, one I considered a migraine where I stayed in bed all day. I assumed it was just because of stress so I didn't go to the hospital. And then I started getting bumps on my head, like in my hair. They start out big, and they get smaller, and they are very sensitive, hurts if i touch them. Since they have been going away within a day, I still didn't think anything of it. But this morning after only 1 bite of breakfast I was feeling nauseous, I ran to the bathroom and started puking blood. I'm not sure if I should go to the hospital because I didn't get nauseous till my husband left for a business trip in which he will be gone for 3 days. And I am a little stressed about him leaving right now. What do you think is happening? Is this all because of stress?

I had two periods in the last month and they were SUPER heavy, I've been really tired and... not just tired but I feel heavy like my muscles don't work almost (if that makes sense).  I have also been having headaches and eye twitches which I almost NEVER get headaches in the past.  I also have had super splitting/brittle nails which is unusual for me.  I've also had joint pain especially in my hip.        I know some of these are symptoms of low iron, and my mom has had iron problems (is it hereditary?).  I've also been having a hard time sleeping lately, so could that be the problem to that, too?  I don't know if all these things are related, I'm just mentioning everything I can think of that's been wrong.      So if it does sound like low iron what should I do?      Oh, other info: I'm a 22 year old female.  Obviously since I had periods lol.  I'm overweight but not like HUGE huge.  I think that's all you might need to know...?  Thanks for the help!

All week we've been planning to see the Watchmen tonight (Friday). I even asked him yesterday if he still planned to go; he said yes & he'd pick up the tix today.

It's just that it seems I can't depend on him for even the little things.      He works the graveyard shift and is doing a lot of overtime to pay for our vacation and so we can move in together, so I know he's tired. But can't he call if he'll be late? Or set his alarm if he's tired?      I want to be as good to him as he is to me. But how can I when I'm so frequently disappointed? Sorry so long and please don't be mean. Am I being childish?

20090306173141AAeZwxc	Health;Men's Health	Is there a man out there that this does not happen to?	You take nice pee, shake it a few times to get off any pee.  Then when your done peeing one drop sometimes two will leak out when your about to pull up your pants or in your boxers.  I am pretty sure this a man law.  Does it happen to you?  Do you just let the boxers absorb it?.  I mean its only one drop.

I know, this probably sounds like a really odd question, maybe even stupid, but I was just wondering, because yesterday I went to the eye doctors and got those bright yellow eye drops that they use to test for glaucoma, and since I have a cold, I have to blow my nose a lot. Anyways, a few hours after I got the eyes drops, I blew my nose and the snot was bright yellow. Does this mean that your tear ducts and sinus' are connected somehow?            Sorry if I'm not using the correct terms..

Anyone know what this is or how to make this stop? its driving me crazy :|       Thanks :]

20090306171311AAhCaxA	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Should I go to the doctors with this?	At the start of January I had a lot of pain in my back, it got so bad that at one point I spent the day in bed because I couldn't move. I noticed some swelling  and bruising on my back, the only thing I could think of was that I must have banged my back on the bedside table during the night.      I never went to the docs and after about a week and half I was fine. Ever since then my back has had this lump or the swelling as just never gone down. It is on the left hand side of my back just above the waist line of my jeans.       Its about 1CM across and sticks out maybe a 1/4 of cm. It feels squishy and there is def something in there that I can move around. It feels a bit like play dough but the centre is hard.      From what I have read online it sounds like a lipoma which is just a fatty lump that can form. It doesn't hurt but I don't know if I'm imagining it but i think it may have gotten bigger.

20090306171334AAS7YJw	Health;Women's Health	Teen girl weight loss program?	i'm meg and i'm using my boyfriends account.       so i'm 16 years old, and soon i'll be 17. i'm going on vacations this summer with my family and another family to florida. i'm overweight. right now i'm about 150 and we're going in mid june. i would really like to loose 20 pounds. and i think that's realistic since we're leaving in about 14 weeks. it's not like i sit around all day doing nothing, because i am strong (i'm kinda a stocky build) and i play soccer. it's just that i'm uncomfortable with the amount of body fat that i have. so what are some healthy ways to loose weight? right now it's lent so i'm trying to limit my sweets that i eat, but sometimes i just get these cravings. so would having something like a slim-fast that's chocolate or Vanilla flavor for breakfast help with these cravings?

20090306171502AAYTEPz	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I have a lower abdominal pressure will not go away.?	I got a case of severe flu around 5 weeks ago.  I've been to the E.R. twice and seen my doctor twice.  The E.R. said I had stools still impacted and that is why my stomach was so far dis sending and sticking out.  So I've even had a colostomy done to check if the problem was there.  But, everything was normal.  But, what I've always had with this and still now is a low abdominal pain or pressure just about 4 or 5 inches above my penis area.  It is always there.  I can sometimes feel the pressure or weird feeling through my penis. The only thing that half way gets rid of it is a anxiety pill called Xanax.  I've been through alot over the past few weeks and I never get an answer from the doctor.  The Doctor even checked for a bladder infection and that was negative as well.  This pressure just never seems to go away and it's effecting my life style.  Its even sometimes hard to get an erection and it use to hurt to ejaculate.  Some help on what is going on would be helpful.  I've never had any health problems since I got this flu.  I just do not know if its anxiety attacks or what?  Just very frustrating not getting an answer.

20090306182050AArZmS8	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Are these early symptoms of osteoarthritis?	A few years ago I began getting knee pain while hiking, mostly while going downhill they would become excruciatingly painful and "lock up" to the point where I just stopped hiking all together. They would be very stiff and painful for several days afterward. They seemed fine doing everyday activities up until about a month ago. I stood from sitting and felt a sudden sharp pain in my knee. Knowing I had classes the next day I immediately elevated and iced it and rested. I awoke the next morning barely able to walk. Went to my dr who gave me a steroid injection and took x-rays. The x-rays looked fine. The steroid injection took the pain away for about a week. Then it slowly began to come back. For the last 3 days I have been unable to walk, or drive, or take care of my young children without constant pain. I am only 28 years old and there was NO injury, did nothing strenuous I just suddenly hurt! My mother has osteoarthritis and she told me her symptoms began at about the same age but not as severe. Could this be osteoarthritis?

And ever since then I have had trouble with constipation.  I went to a  doctor and all he gave me was a small tube that has some kinda of creamy medication that I had to put in my anus for 6 weeks, plus I had to drink some miralax to get some fluid in my stool.

My two front teeth are curved outwards, kinda triangular like this / \ <--- actually exactly light that...o-o. My k-9's are up more...5 millimeters is my guess, higher than my two front teeth. The teeth in between those are crooked as well...GOSH my mouth is a mess!!. Im 14 turning 15 in 22 days...and its just horrible to have a mouth like this. At school ive earned the name 'snaggle tooth' from basically everyone, and my mouth is giving me the most HORRIBLE social life ever...I haven’t smiled in at least 6 years, in photos I usually just stretch me lips...Its horrible. So my question is, Should I get metal braces? Or Invisalign braces. Ive got very low pain tolerance for most things, especially when it comes to my mouth, and I don’t want to have bad breath, or get food stuck, or anything like that...because that could make everything worse, and I heard that metal braces REALLY do a number on your mouth (Cut it up and stuff). Invisalign is clear, but apparently they have buttons that also really hurt your mouth, and even if you can take them out, it really hurts after you get your second tray. Is there anyway to skip braces for me? Maybe just get the dentist to align them (My friend lost her two front adult teeth, and they put them back for her) and give me a retainer of some sort?...

I'm a 14 year old male and i'm a freshman in high school. I am trying to build muscle mass, and one of my friends just recently told me about using whey protein.

20090306192150AAtM3Dq	Health;Women's Health	Has anyone ever tried a "love swing?" Are they comfortable? Fun?	And can anyone offer advice on the pros and cons between the two following options: One that requires hardware and permanent installation (the pricier option of the two)( http://www.slumberparties.com//productde...        or a door-mounted one  http://www.slumberparties.com/productdet...       I'm leaning toward the door-mounted one since it's less expensive and less permanent, but then I wonder if that means it will be on the door?!

Those last two questions are my main curiosities. Does anyone know anything about this?      I'm interested in this because my husband & I are trying to spice things up, and I'm kinda acrobatic, so this sounds like fun...if it's everything it claims to be.

I was a greek god, not bragging just trying to explain how healthy I was. Anyway, nothing could slow me down, I was also very, very smart and good looking. As soon as I hit 22 I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression, now all my bones are sore all the time, and i don`t even work that much. Not horribly sore but just enough to be a pain in the butt. Like if it`s not my feet hurting it`s my head or my back or my neck hurting. My hands get sore from doing limited amount of work. My dad has arthritus and I`m hoping that`s what I have. Could it be MS? Could I have a tumor. Seems like since I was diagnosed with A&D I started getting all this other physical stuff wrong with me. I can never consentrate, or think straight. I feel like I`m on drugs all the time. Which Im not. I am VERY irritable. which is crazy for me because I never was. Other day I threw my cat across the house because he wouldn`t stop meowing, now i feel like the biggest idiot. So Why do I feel so old, anybody?

20090306212944AAvvbng	Health;Women's Health	Worried about my girlfriend...help?	Okay, I am seventeen. Let me just start off by describing my girlfriend's personality. She's quiet, sweet, and a preppy girl (lol). But she has a great personality, and its one of the things I love about her. Physically, she's quite small. She's about five feet tall and weighs under 95 pounds (I'm not sure of how much exactly.)       So I introduced her to my friends a couple of weeks back, but ever since we've been around them as of late, she's become really clingy and doesn't want me to leave her alone with them. Now, when I'm there, I never notice them picking on her or teasing her, but that's only when I'm there. She's shy, but I've never seen her this shy. From where I see it, it seems like something was said or something was done that she's uncomfortable with. First of all, how can I ask her in a sensitive way? Second, how can I ask my friends without seeming like a jerk? And third, (and this is for personal reasons), does asking this show I care for my girlfriend or is it just natural?

20090306213216AAfPJzB	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I Am Very Overwhelmed but Not Ready To Give Up...Yet...?	I have Tourette's. *audible punching noises* ******* son of a ***** *****   If that's starred out...well, I just said it, thought it might add *more and more punching* some reality to this question. Like I said, I have Tourette's. *punches self in chest and forehead/head* And I have a host of *spits twice* horrendous tics that *clap* I cannot suppress despite neurologists expirimentation with numerous neuroleptics.... *spits then pounds self on head, moaning in self-induced pain* which landed me in the emergency room once for the terrifying reactions.   Now we are looking into *spits* less potent medication and therapy which will also target *spits and punches self in head and chest again*   the OCD component. Last night...OMG I had this sort of rage attack and I fell on the floor (I have falling compulsions) and started thrashing around like I often do since my Tourette's got severe two and a half months ago--and knocked over several things...and now it looks like a torando went thru there. I knock stuff over, spit, hit myself, kick, pound on the walls (yet to do any damage, thankfully) bite myself, curse sporadically although I really don't want to and have almost lost hope. The old doctor I had recommended brain surgery if it kept getting worse...which it has so far, kept getting WORSE not better.   And no doctor so far can explain or prove why it got worse so suddenly. Teenage patients like myself are usually getting BETTER not worse. I can't even walk right, I have to hop instead of walk because when I walk, I have to squat quite frequently, every three or so steps.   Help?!          * 3 hours ago       * - 4 days left to answer.      Additional Details   about the brain surgery: it is risky of course...and for some people, it's like magic, but for others it does almost nothing. so it might or might not work, its dangerous, and I'd have to wait four more months before I'd even be elligible for the procedure cuz its for people who've been severe for 6 months.   the therapy place is promising, really good, highly recommended, only therapy takes time and effort...maybe months of it, but I am trying to stay sane for now! And there is the possibility they are overrated..what I'll do next, my parents say in that instance, we'd move on...but there is no cure for my disease. People don't tend to research rare, non-deadly diseases, now don't they? I can see that more would research cancer, but still!

20090306213524AAud2jU	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	What should I do about this? Someone please help me. Its an emergency. Should I say something?	Ok there was a staff here at job corps that I used to talk to. I always looked up to him as a dad I never had. But I was wrong. Because once I started to get to know him. He would kiss me in the head. I didn't think much of it. He one time kissed me in the mouth. I looked at him weird. And I left it alone. Then I would notice he would take me to places away from everyone. He would take me into one of the buildings. When we were in there he would start grabbing my butt. He would tell me you have the nicest A$$ I have ever touched. I couldn't go any where because he some how got me in the corner where I couldn't move. Then he would tell me to kiss him I would tell him no. He would not let me go until I gave him a kiss. He would tell me this is our little secret don't tell anyone. I was scared so I didn't say anything to anyone. I would always tell other staff how he was a good man. Sometimes he would take me to the third floor of a building. He would take me into some kind of lounge area. He one time got on top of me and I told him to get off I don't like it. He would tell me oh be quiet you know you like it. I was really scared I didn't know what to do I was in shock everytime he had me cornered or something. This went on for almost two years. I was really scared to say something. And I think thats what made my anxiety and depression worse. He then had to quit his job because the doctor told him he had to for some reason. But when he was at job corps he would tell me im special to him. And he would always by me what I needed or what ever I wanted. But I never asked him for anything. Before he left job corps he took me again far away from everyone. Took me into a building where it was really dark inside the building. He then took out his you know what and told me to touch it. I said no I tried to leave buy he had the door blocked where I couldn't go any where. But back to where I said he had to go because his doctor said. He took me out not to long ago and told me lets go out for a drink. And instead he took me out in the middle of no where. He then stared touching me in places he was not suppose to. I told him to stop but of course he didn't listen. He started kissing me and wouldn't let me go. He would talk to me so dirty all the time it would make me so mad. I would tell him to stop and he would tell me you like it. I finally said something to my off center counselor and she told me to press charges on him. And that he is not allowed to go back on center at all. He is not allowed to contact me or anything. But I was too afraid to press charges. I didn't even tell her who it was. I told her not to do anything about it. And she hasn't Im so scared that someone else might not believe me. Im afraid that his wife would hate me or something. I feel like this is all my fault. Now I really can't be around guys. If a guy comes up to me and hugs me I tell him in a very rude way get the hell away from me. Or I say don't touch me. I flinch when I see them go past me. Should I press charges like my counselor said? none of the staff here at job corps know about this. Only two staff know. But I told them not to say anything. They haven't said anything. I don't want to say it to any of the staff here at job corps. Because when they tell another staff they are not careful when they say it when there are students around. I don't want the students to know what was going on. Because then they would start spreading rumors.

20090306202703AAMXAdF	Health;Diet & Fitness	How can I lose 15 pounds?	Starting tomorrow, I want to lose 15 pounds by early June.  Can I do it?        I eat pretty healthy; and I don't eat all that much, really. I do crunches and stretch; and so far I've lost about 8 pounds doing that.         I'm thinking about running (jogging) this summer, too. I'm...out of shape (yes, I'll admit to it); and I'm tired of it. But I'm a littl concerned about gaining too much muscle. I've got chubby legs, and I don't want them to stay chubby with muscle. I want them thin and smaller.         Will running (jogging) make my legs BIGGER? Is there anyway I can run and not gain too much muscle mass?

Sometime during the night, I have no clue when, I woke up- kind of.       I'd had a nightmare, I could feel it, I was terrified. I couldn't move any part of my body. I was laying on my stomach and my hand was hanging over the side of my bed. I remembering feeling so terrified, like something was out to get me, and I tried to pull my hand back from hanging over the bed, scared that something would grab it, but I couldn't move it.       I remember feeling panicked and trying to make a noise, scream out or something, but nothing was happening. I couldn't move or make a noise. I don't remember much more, but this happened 2 or 3 times during the whole night.       I woke up the next morning feeling back to normal but scared shitless because I felt like I'd had a horrible nightmare, I felt so shaken up. All I remember is the panic and the need to cry when I woke up in the middle of the night those few times and couldn't move. I felt like I was being watched.       Just thinking about it now is seriously making me wanna cry. I don't wanna go to bed again, I'm really scared.   It's not easy to freak me out or shake me up, but this is.

Like when i walk sometimes i just walk on my toes, like don't even put my feet firmly on ground.   My legs and arms sometimes feel weak.      I have been suffering from this since I had panic attack 4 months ago.      I keep on saying to my doctor that maybe something neurologically is wrong with me but she keeps on saying its Anxiety.

I get put on 3 month waiting lists then called to reschedule my appointment 3 months later.  This issue is happening everywhere I call.      I was prescribed Celexa by my doctor.  I took it for a month but it made me worse. I honestly think it made me more anxious and suicidal.  I never thought about taking my life as much until I started taking that medicine.      I can't seem to find anyone to help me.  I've called several doctors offices and many of them give me an appointment 3 months down the line.  I don't feel like my situation can wait that long anymore.      My suicidal feelings have diminished however my anxiety is so bad that I have a hard time leaving the house now.

20090306202340AAetUVA	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I have osgood-schlatter disease and it will not cease, when will it end?	I began to get knee pain during track season doing long distance running. Prior to that, I did a lot of running in the fall in cross-country and ice hockey. I did not experience bad knee pain till track, and I took the season off, and I only periodically played hockey. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatters, and was told rest would help. I layed off it for two months, and in July I started hockey camp where I only played on ice for 6 weeks, where I experienced more knee pain. After that came try-outs, but my knees were still not better. I tried Oscon, but it seemed to have no effect, after taking it reguraly. At the end of august I decided to take the hockey season off because it was too debilitating and  hockey costs money. Now it is the beginning of March, I haven't done any running or anything to makes my knees hurt, in interest of it healing faster. They still hurt though, and I feel pain when walking early in the morning sometimes. It sucks, and I am worried about it.... when will it get better? This is the worst. Also, I am 15, I turn 16 next July.

I have not noticed any Swelling of my Testicles or any bumps but the Wierd viens on the bottom and back of my testicle seem larger than they were before, and whenever I try to examine them it hurts for quite a while as a dull pain. I talked to my doctor about the nipple thing and he said that was probably just my teenage hormones. I didnt mention the Testicles, I may phone him tommorow, but, does this sound familiar? I'm 14 and I dont wanna get any blood work if its just something that is normal. The only time the pain was unbearable was the first time, I had to have a really long warm bath to loosen the muscles then go right to sleep.

( my periods are usually weird when they come, but i'm sure it should come next week at the latest if it doesn't come tomorrow... it should be 30 days by march 7th.)       anyway, can someone help? I'm sure it will go away, but if it doesn't i'm gonna get paranoid. Can anyone help me?

She kept saying I was on Tri-Cyclen and I insisted that for the past 2 years my other doctors gave me just Cyclen...and I even showed her the packages they came in. She said ok..wrote me a prescription..I went to CVS and guess what they gave me? Tri-cyclen :)      I'm not in the mood to argue and my new doctor has a thick accent it's hard to hear her explainations so I just thought I'd ask here why she would prefer me on that and if there will be any changes. I know it's three different levels of hormones (I heard it's supposed to mimic your bodies natural cycle) but I'm not sure why she would think that's best I was doing just fine before. Thanks :))      P.S. She's also argued with me that I have not been diagnosed with other things by other doctors so I'm a little worried she's a loon :S

This girl emberrased me in front of the whole class and made my crus hate me. so i accidentaly cussed her out cuz I got so mad and now everyone in my class is against me and they treat me like a dirty virus.      4. whenever I cry noone helps me and many people just tell me to talk to a councler but i can NOT do that no matter what I do so DONT say anything about talking to counclers. I used to talk to them before and all they say to you is stupid cheesy stuff and make you more suicidal by calling social workers.

Everyone said to use Ban deodorant for my sensitive underarms since some kinds turn me red under there.      Alot of people said make sure it dont have Aluminum Zirconium which the kinds i tried did, but this Ban kind has aluminum chlorohydrate 18% so can i still try that one? It's unscented.    Then Ban satin breeze doesnt mention aluminum anything as an active ingredient but thats scented.       so these are my questions:    How is it that unscented has aluminum chlor but the scented satin breeze doesnt mention it? =/    Are they to close of ingredients "aluminum zirconium" and "aluminum clorohydrate" to even try the one with chlor since they both start with aluminum?      Also which kind if you have sensitive skin and underarms turn red do you use?      (I DONT NOT HAVE RED UNDERARMS RIGHT NOW so please dont say i should use some cream, i only get red if i use certain kinds of deodorant and people on here say its probably cause of aluminum zirconium)

I probably need to lose weight for them to really pop, BUT I am pretty thin already (5'4", 125) and have been trying to GAIN weight.   I vary my routine all the time, and years ago had more of a 6-pack (so I knows it's possible)      Are there any exercises that are better than the rest?  And/or what suppliments might help me with my workout with making me lose too much (if any) weight.

20090227085927AAalC9m	Health;Other - Health	Why is my tongue yellow?	About 4 days ago I was brushing my teeth and noticed that my tongue was yellow, but I figured that it was caused by something I ate so I scrubbed my tongue with my tooth brush and used some Listerine rinse but the yellow remained. Well it's been like 4 days now and it's still yellow. The only thing that I'm doing different is I started taking iron pills because I went to the doctor about 2 weeks ago and they noticed my hemoglobin was low (due to my vegetarian diet) and told me to take iron pills once a day, which I've been doing. Could that be causing it somehow? And to top it off I'm coming down with some kind of cold or flu now, my nose is congested and my throat is killing me, could that have any relation? I'm going to talk with my doctor later but I'm just curious as to what it could be.   Thanks =)

20090227093613AAjM2Wg	Health;Women's Health	Got my period - Uterus pulsating?	Yesterday, all day, I could feel my abdonminal area throbbing or pulsating.   At the end of the day, I had got my period.   So I figured that that was basically the reason.   It's so weird, though...   I can feel the blood moving in there.   It feels really strange and it's uncomfortable/annoying.   I could feel it this morning as well.   I don't really have any stomach cramps, so I know it's not the pain from those that are causing the throbbing.      It's never happend before.      I realize that I'm probably ok, but I just find it weird.   Any ideas as to WHY I'd feel the blood basically emptying from my body?

20090227120408AAixa4Z	Health;Mental Health	Stink bugs/bug phobia.?	I'm 16 and I have a horrible fear of bugs... I don't know why, but I do and it's something I can't control.  I understand that I'm bigger than them and I understand that my fear's irrational... that doesn't make it go away though.  The worst thing is stink bugs.  They scare the crap out of me because they always flutter around my head when I least expect it.  They fly directly towards the windows and smack into them.  They're just annoying.  I don't know if this is common or not, but I've found that it's the flying insects that bother me more than something that can only crawl.  I absolutely hate anything buzzing around my eyes, ears, nose, & mouth.  It's like I'm hyper sensitive to them.  Any tips or advice on phobias, bugs, etc. are greatly appreciated!
