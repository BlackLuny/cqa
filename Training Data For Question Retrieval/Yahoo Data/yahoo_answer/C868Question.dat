The college where the nursing program is that I want to get into has a 3 year waiting list.  There is an LVN program that is 18 months in town. Does anyone think it is a good idea for me to take the LVN program and work for a little bit while I am on the waiting list for the RN program?  Do you think it would just be a waste of time, because I do have prerequisite courses to complete for the nursing program.  Should I work on two degrees at the same time?  Let me know what you think!

20090220164219AAkTvYK	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Food Service	Is it me or is management being too harsh on me with the workplace tardiness policy?(possible double standard)?	I work as a waitress.  I follow the rules and customers consistently tell management that I'm one of the most pleasant waitresses they've ever seen.      Yesterday, one of the waitresses called out of work for a dubious reason(she claimed to have a "migraine" but management suspects she was too hungover and didn't want to work the very slow weekday dayshift).      Meanwhile, I was running late to work -- due to a doctors appointment that ran longer than planned -- so I called the manager to notify her that I was late, and arrived 10 mins late for my shift.  This was the first time I was ever late at all.      Today on my day off, the manager calls me to scold me for my 10min lateness, then threatens to fire me if I'm ever late ever again.      :(      Okay so yes I was 10mins late, but do you think management is being a little harsh?  Especially since there's been people calling out more than once(e.g., the girl that called out on the day I was 10mins late), and I haven't ever called out?  The bartender was almost an hour late on the very busy VALENTINES DAY shift when there were a ton of customers + a party of 65 people that ordered "open bar" -- and this wasn't the first time she was late -- but she's still employed!  So, do you think they're running a double standard on me?  Or, do you think they're trying to "scare" me?      I realize that I cannot do anything about this, but I'm curious -- what are some possible reasons to explain why management would hold me to tighter standards than others?      One last question -- do you think my coworker's "calling out of work" made the management resent 'my' minor lateness more?

After putting one year of nursing school in I find myself maybe I don't want to be a nurse but during my rotations I got to spend some time with a Public Health Coordinator and feel that this is what I really want to do.    My question is, Would it be to my benefit if i went for a masters in public health knowing my undergrad was a B.A? College admin say I have high enough grades to get into grad school for public health but I think College admin will say anything to get people to come. With my previous degree would you think i could get a job in the field of public health or does the typical people who go into public health have nursing degrees or science degrees?

Here's the deal, there was an insurance claim on the property I'm looking to buy on 12/15/2005. The cause, "other" or "unknown".  Total cost paid, $2370. Status of filed claimed, OPEN.      Now, my insurance company which is State Farm pulled this information up when I was hunting for home owners insurance and said that I cannot get insurance through them until the file status has been closed.      I spoke with my realtor who spoke to his broker on how to go about getting the information to see if the problem was fixed and if it could be updated. This property is bank owned and the bank will not provide any information because it claims that they do not know of any problems.      Is there someone I can contact to find this information out? The listing agents are not helpful, the bank is no use and my realtor is at wits end. I'd really like the property, but I want to make sure this is not an ongoing issue that I will assume once I purchase the property.      HELP PLEASE!!!!

20090220182137AApoiCt	Business & Finance;Credit	Collection agency and identity theft, what should I do?	I have a huge problem.  I had a credit card that went into collections.  a $200 limit.  The company I worked for while I had this card moved to Tennessee so I couldn't pay this in time.  It went to NCO Financial which is the worst collection agency it could have possibly gone to.  Just google it and just the feedback alone is enough to make you distgusted.  Well anyways, I got terrible harrassing phone calls and a woman that told me I was a bad mother for having a debt in collections and so forth.  Her abusive call was the last time I heard from NCO last year.  As of August, I found out I had identity theft and to make an extremely long story short, the employee of NCO Financial that told me I was a bad mother, etc. stole my identity.  She rented apartments, opened up phone lines and other credit accounts.  I'm working with the authorities where I'm located as well as where she is located, but it's been taking an extremely long time to get her prosecuted.  I have to wait to hear from the state she's in.  I received a letter in the mail today from Wyse Financial wanting to collect this bill and I don't know whether to pay it because it's my accumulated interest or if I should be entitled to not pay it because the woman from NCO stole my information and hurt my credit even more this way.  What would you do?  Wyse Finanacial is owned by NCO Financial or vise versa and I don't trust any collection agency.  I tried to talk to Wyse Financial and discuss the issues, but she lied to me and said she was management and tried to tell me I had no identity theft because her computer could see everywhere my social security number was used and she said it was never used outside of my town.  I knew she was lying because she wasn't very bright.  Should I pay this bill, I don't trust any agency now because of what happened?

Recently my husband received a bill from the credit card company with a Service charge of $10 on it.  He contacted the company to inquire on the charge and was told that they sent out a notice that they were adding the charge instead of increasing the promo rate that he was locked in with.   In addition, the minimum payment doubled.  They did say that they could withdrawl the $10 monthly service fee if he moved to a higher rate.  Is this legal?  Can they do that to a rate that you were locked into?  This change did not occur as a result of late pays, etc.

So I used turbo tax for my taxes because I didn't think they were that complex. I am a full time student at a University and I held 5 jobs last year, 3 simultaneously. Lets say I paid $800 in income tax last year, after filling out all the answers and applying the Lifetime Learning Credit my return was supposed to be $800, a 100% of my money back. I thought this was good, but then I went to work today and this guy who works at the restaurant with me said he is getting $1400 back and said that the government only took $800 from him. I asked how could he get more money back than he gave and he said that at HR Block they found a student credit that allowed him to get an additional $600. I am very curious at why I didn't get this credit or what this credit is.

We usually get a refund in April.  We currently do not own a home.        We are looking into buying a home, and I know all about the write offs that come with that.        We were told that my husband could be claiming Married 5, on his W-4 form.  We are legally married, I do not work, and we have one child.  My husband makes about $45K a year, if this info makes any difference.  We were told we can claim married 5 and claim the max exemptions ONLY if we owned a house.        We have NO interest in owing the government money every April.  However, when we do buy a house, is it worth it for my husband to change his filing status, knowing that we will have all those extra write offs that come with owning a home, in order to get extra money in each paycheck?        Basically, we want to make sure that if we do this, 1.) It's legal, and 2.) We won't be screwing ourselves come next tax season.        Thanks very much for any insight!

20090220193100AAVwrEz	Business & Finance;Small Business	What should I do about the problem I have at work? More specifically with the assistant manager.?	I've been working at this certain place for two years now, almost two and a half. While this other co-workers been there for almost a year. Lets call the co-worker beth and the assistant manager sara. Beth normally works about 6 hours during the weekdays (she has another job). Beth had a problem with the manager in training (MIT) so she called in two tuesdays in a row, meaning she didn't work the tuesdays when the MIT was working.      I got sick a few days a ago (right now my entire families sick).    I was really sick on wednesday but decided to stay since we were short staffed on tuesday (beth) and monday (another co-worker, wasn't her fault).   It was obvious that I was sick since two of the other people I was working with kept asking me if I was ok.   Sara was the closing manager that night (wednesday).   I got worse on thursday so I decided to call in sick since I was sick.   And when I did, i had to tell the manager in charge of course which just happened to be Sara. Our conversation when something like this:   Sara: hello?   Me: Hi sara, I'm calling to let you know I won't be able to come in tonight.   Sara: oh? why not?   Me: I'm sick, I haven't been feeling well. (I can never lie)   Sara: Ok, well we're gonna need a doctors note.   Me: I thought that was only for the weekends?   Sara: no   Me: I'm not going to the doctors, ( i said something along the line of not going to the doctors and taking care of myself)   Sara: Ok I'll let ------- know. (the actual manager)      My problem is that when I call in to tell them i can't come, they ask for a doctors note.      But when beth calls in no one asks her for a docs note!!!   I don't know if anyone can tell but I'm a bit furious!!   Sara and beth get along great to the point when Sara was making up excuses for beth to tell the MIT so she wouldn't be so mad about why beth was avoiding her (they had an argument, beth and MIT)       What should I do? I'm not someone to hold a grudge but I really do think I was treated unfairly!!

20090220195632AAuCJ5C	Business & Finance;Insurance	How are companies going to be reimbursed for their Cobra assistance under the new stimulus bill?	My wife works in the HR department for a home builder and as you can imagine, we aren't doing so well these days.  In fact the company isn't showing a profit at all which means we aren't paying taxes this year, nor likely next year either.  She comes home tonight explaining that they now have to offer Cobra to ex-employees under the new stimulus bill.  I asked her how they would get reimbursed for the 65% that the government is supposedly going to be paying for Cobra insurance.  She said in the form of a Tax Credit.  Not a Tax deduction, nor a reimbursement check, but a Tax Credit.  Now Tax Credits would normally be a good way to get your 65% supplement from the government since you would get the full 65% as apposed to a deduction which would mean you only get to reduce your income by that amount and thereby not get the full dollar amount in the end.  However, and this is a big however, if your not paying taxes because your not making a profit, a tax credit does us no good.  Especially companies that are being hit the hardest given the source of our current economic situation, credit/finance companies and home builders being the main three, none of us are making money, so none of us are paying taxes.  A tax credit does us no good what so ever.  So the end result is that we are now out of pocket more money with no way of getting it back.  We will collect 35% of the Cobra premium from the ex-employee with a credit that will never come from the government.  On top of that, since the only people that will take advantage of this program are the ones that are sick, we could be out some serious cash money here with no way of getting it back since we aren't paying taxes and can't collect the tax credit.      The only way I could be wrong about all of this is if the 65% credit is refundable.  If it's refundable then even if we don't pay taxes then we would get a check from the government.  Does anyone know if this Cobra repayment plan is refundable or not?
20090220195837AApR7pi	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	What are some solutions to being more financially responsible?	A few months after I met my now husband, I found out I was pregnant.During my pregnancy he did little to support me as I could work less and less.  I waited tables and by the time I was 7 months I could not handle the load I did before I was pregnant.  I got even more behind as pre-pregnancy I was barely making it.  A month before the baby was born he moved in and provided somewhat for the first few months of the babies life while I was unpaid maternity leave.  During that time my bills from before him were not getting paid because there was no money plus all the hospital bills from crappy insurance.  I had a few more hospital visits after then and began working at better job but it still didn't cover all my bills.  We decided to get married, but he refused to help me pay any of the bills except what he considered his - half the rent. and sometimes expenses to the baby  Many of my bills went to collections and we ended up getting evicted.  To make matters worse, I ended up getting pregnant again, but found an even better job.  Before I met my husband I had some student  loan debt, a car loan and some credit card debt equalling about $50,000.  Now with all the hospital bills and everything I owe over $75,000.  I am barely making it now and having to pay hundreds of dollars in bank fees each month.  My husband hoards his money and will not even sit down with me to help me figure things out.  I have no other family and am at a loss as to what to do.  I don't need to be critisized I just need sound advice on how to get out of this.  I am in a bad cycle that if I just leave money in the bank, it gets eaten up and I can't provide for my kids.  My marriage is falling apart and my husband is verbally abusive.  I have tried shelters but they have no room and there is a waitlist unless I call the cops on my husband.  I have tried legal aid, but I make too much.  The lawyers I have talked to want at least $2000 down to file for bankrupcy.  I make $55,000, and I live in the most expensive county in the US where the cheapest rent I could find takes up half of my monthly paycheck and daycare a fourth of it.  My credit can't get worse.  I just need ideas and resources on how I can get better for my kids sake and leave this relationship.

I told him I cannot stay because I had family coming in town and I had to entertain them at my house. Than he told me I have to stay, and if I don’t it will be held against me i.e. termination.

20090220211715AAscSeK	Business & Finance;Insurance	Are there options for patients with cirrhosis but no life insurance?	My cousin Danielle has recently developed cirrhosis, as the result of a pre-existing condition. Unfortunately, she is only twenty-four years old and has no health insurance and currently has no job, though she is seeking one. I would like to ask on her behalf - if there are options out there for someone in her position and with her condition. I know that the complications and problems arising for a person in her situation are staggering, to say the least and that most health insurance companies will automatically deny help to someone in her position. But I would like to know if there could be some disabilty pension or another type of health insurance that may still be an option?       Currently, because my cousin has no job - she lives off SSDI checks and unemployment benefits every month - so she lives roughly on $890 dollars a month, after taxes and paying for living expenses.       Please I would appreciate any professional or personal experiences or constructive advice. Thank you very much.

20090203092114AAJWkMr	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	What type of lawyer should i look for?	I recently got laid off from my job because I had to attend to my son who was in and out of the hospital with croup then whooping cough... followed by pink eye..he is only 1 yr old. The excuse they gave me was that my son was getting sick too much and that it was unacceptable for me to be missing work or calling late because of his illnesses! I am furious because they told me that I needed to find someone else to attend to him while i was at work. Which i found cold hearted due to the fact that I am his mother not anyone else. I've got advice from several people to sue for discrimination. Also I am 5 months pregnant and they shoved that in my face that if i left when it was time to give birth i wasn't going to have a job anyways...so basically they killed 2 birds with one stone? WHAT SHOULD I DO?

20090203092946AAbmhBn	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Do I take this new job or keep my old one? ?	SO here's the thing   I currently work at Red Robin. I have worked there for awhile now and they really try to give me a good schedule. I work three days a week, around my class schedule, and not on weekends. I don't work weekends because my fiance lives 2 hours away and I really like to visit him on the weekends.    The problem is that the shifts I am working are not helping with my bills much. I average about $200 a week (going from at the very least $400 a week) which is not enough to pay my bills. I would like to work more, but now we are overstaffed and it is almost impossible to get weekend shifts!   On the other hand, I applied and got the job as a bartender in a bar that will be opening in about a week. The schedule works very well around my school schedule, except i will be working weekends. The man who will be my boss is very worried that I won't work weekends - so I told him I would.    That being said, the money will be MUCH better - but I won't really be able to see my fiance. This bar is open until 2:00am and if my fiance comes to visit me, I will be working either from 10am- 6pm or 6pm-2am... seems kind of pointless for him to come visit, right?   Anyway - I need some real advice... I'm at a loss.   Do I stay at Red Robin or go to the new bar?

Im curently looking to rent out a new small shop for my business they are wanting me to sign up for a three year lease which seems the norm.  What is worrying me though is if my new venture should fail i will be stuck tied into this lease.    My question is that should my business fail will i still be responsible for paying the lease for the rest of the agreed term?    Would i better off setting up as a limited company to avoid this pitfall if things turn worse in this economic climate and my business fails.    Thankyou

20090203095200AAt8nVP	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Advice on balancing Loan Payments vs Savings?	Currently after taxes and 401k deductions, I'm getting around a $3800 / mo. paycheck.      Currently about $1,300 of that is going toward paying off what is about 50k in student loans.  At the rate I'm paying my loans should be paid off in about 4-4 1/2 years, paying around 6-7,000 in interest over that time.      After deducting the $1,300 and other expenses from my paycheck (rent, food, gas, etc...) I still have about $700-1100 of unspent money that I bank (into my checking).      I'm wondering if this money would be better spent either:      A) being used to further pay off my loans.  This doesn't leave much as far as saving money goes.      B) kept in my checking and saved, as an emergency fund or otherwise      C) partially invested in something (commodities, money market, stocks, etc...).  This one it a little risky considering the economy...      If C), what are some recommended investment vehicles (I already put 12% of my paycheck into 401k, I'm 24 and figure this is a good time for me to bank money in at an economic downturn).  Money Markets don't earn much, and I really don't know how comfortable I feel buying stock...

I work at Big Lots as a cashier and hated it from the start, my brother got me the job so I'm thankful to him for doing so since I needed the money for highschool expenses. I'm 18 and will soon graduate and my parents would prefer I work right after I graduate so if I quit now finding a job would be much harder. I have been looking and even applying for new jobs, I strangely want to work in the postal service as a mailman but I can't drive. I hate not likeing my job since so many people have lost jobs and I feel sorry for them but having a job is not something I want for the rest of my life. I don't even know where I'm going with this to be honest, I'm just confused. I don't even know how to properly use comma's so if you see one where it shouldn't or none where it should be that's why. I live in Rhode Island btw if that helps and I'm looking for a job that's easy [I don't mean to sound lazy], and fun. Something I would like [don't mean to sound conceited either] Is there any sites you could recomend or any jobs that are like that? Would you like to share your experiences or help me?

I live in a house with 3 other people. Only one of them signed the lease and her name is on the bills as well. Me and another roommate can no longer afford to live at the house and we want to move out. By next week we are almost guaranteed to get a new place, and my question is do we have to give the girl on the lease 30 days notice, or the landlords 30 day notice? We both payed the security deposit but neither of us signed anything. Also if the security deposit was the same cost as the rent and the landlord has to give us that back can we just use that money to pay for the 30 days amount of rent? We live in Oregon by the way. Thanks.
