iRKOJhYeaa	I was once in a very abusive relationship with a man. He didn't physically or sexually abuse me, the abuse was psychological and mental. I wont go into too much detail cos i would be here all day, but it was basically constantly undermining me, putting me down, insulting me and generally making it seem as though everything I was, and everything I had achieved amounted to nothing. Lots of mind games. It started off very subtly at first - I didn't even notice, but then gradually it got worse and more worse until finally I found the courage to leave. I really can understand why people stay in abusive relationships, how hard it is to get out. It took ages for me to get over it, because he really had succeeded in making me feel like I was worthless. BUT, it hasn't made me bitter towards all men, just bitter towards him, and now ive put it all down to experience and ive moved on. Now I am in a relationship with a wonderful man, hes quite a bit younger than me and hes everything that the other c**t was not. <br>  <br>  As for my dad and my brother, as far as I am concerned, they are two of the best people in the world! We are all going out later today, my mum included and I'm really looking forward to it, I love our family get togethers, because I really do love my wonderful family! :)<br>  <br>  Edit: Do you know what? I really don't understand why someone would give a thumbs down for an answer such as this!|`|WKtakdsOaa	No not at all. My parents have been together since I was 14 and I see them every day and they have always had a great relationship. My husband treats me fantastic and nothing is too much trouble for him to do for me and my brother is one of my best mates and we spend loads of time together.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of people on here like that though and thats why they worry about things that I cant say I have ever thought about or encountered|`|ibaLRXY2aa	I have been in a couple of emotionally abusive relationships, but thank God I was never physically abused. I try not to view every man as a potential jerk, though. I don't have any bitterness toward the male species as a whole, and I try really hard not to be bitter toward the couple who screwed me over.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	No. My father was a very nurturing stay at home dad and most of my friends happen to be male. However, I kinda see what you are saying from my own observations.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I've noticed this too.  It seems like a lot of women here have been raped, abused, sexually assaulted, etc., and a lot of men here have gone through bad divorces or been abused themselves.  Not all of us have though.  I haven't.  Well, actually I have been sexually harassed, and some people have said I've been sexually assaulted.  If you take a very strict hard-line approach to sexual assault my situation would actually qualify, although even I think it might be a bit of an overstatement.  It was heading that way though.  But I really haven't had too many bad experiences with women.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	I've never had a problem with the opposite sex. I'm anti-feminist because I could see what feminism was with a sane, conscious mind, and I immediately opposed it.<br>  <br>  I've had no bad experiences with the opposite sex that shaped my belief. It was all my own logic and thinking.<br>  <br>  I've seen a lot of GWS feminists admitting to bad relationships with men. I'd like to think it had nothing to do with their beliefs but when I read some of their statements I'm not so sure.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	I think its a natural knee-jerk reaction to generalise dislike against the type of person who has hurt you. I say its natural, but I also think its immature and weak, and something to be grown out of. Men seem to know that if they get hurt by a woman (e.g. divorce) and thereafter lose all faith in women, this is just giving in to bitterness. However the same doesn't seem to apply to the women who become feminists, and this is because in the West we have a ready-made and socially sanctioned outlet for people who have a problem with men, and its called the feminist movement. <br>  <br>  I would estimate that the majority of active feminists would become normal happy women again if they sought therapy - from a non-feminist therapist - to get to the root of their vendetta against men.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I've had a few boyfriends do some, well let's just leave it for the imagination; not to mention my first husband and one of my last ever boyfriends were mentally abusive. It doesn't matter anymore; it's over. I moved on with my life; you always have to move on, and that is that. Still, while going through it all Feminism never once interested me.
V7f6pQy6aa	I started exactly the same time as those kids in your 6th grade class. I personally think it is a natural phase, especially since that time of children's lives they start going through puberty. As fpr those grade 3 kids, maybe they just surfed the internet and either accidently went into the website, or they were curious since they havent learned alot about that topic before. but definately the th graders might be starting their puberty phase and thats when teenagers emerge and when they have yet to fully understand the adult nature of things. i hoped this answered your question.|`|BB4Qd9ymaa	My friend started at age 14 and that's been the most common age i've seen.<br>  <br>  3rd grade, though?<br>  <br>  Wow.
CRDl9nffaa	The short answer seems to be that they didn't until after the two great wars when blue became associated with boys/men because of the blue colours of mass produced military and working clothes. This in itself was because blue was the cheapest and most widely available dye.<br>  <br>  There's a very good article here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hueconsulting.blogspot.com/2007/03/why-is-blue-for-boys-and-pink-for-girls.html" rel="nofollow">http://hueconsulting.blogspot.com/2007/0...</a><br>  <br>  which explores the history of this subject.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	yeah I know!!<br>  <br>  AND when girls where blue its no big deal but when guys where pink, they are apparently gay?!   I don't get it.<br>  <br>  All though, here in australia allot of guys where pink shirts, so that whole things is wearing off here, but still!!|`|MPOHHTtAaa	I know huh since babies can't even make out those colors for a long time! I like browns and greens for babies anyway, my daughters room was mostly browns and beiges with a little pink. But sorry, I don't know why.|`|eykCjMNdaa	Its a stereotype. Blue is a cold color and pink is a hot color. Guys are supposed to  associate with the colder side while girls are supposed to associate with the hotter side. So girls wear pink. Girls can be cold and people are okay with it, but if a guy tries to wear hot colors, he is considered gay. <br>  I've personally gotten rid of these stereotypes.. I wear what I feel like.|`|6SVWXQLhaa	im not entirely sure why, but here's some food for thought - a friend of mine who is in her final year of psychology at university was telling me about how, before the war, pink was for boys and blue for girls.<br>  <br>  now that's gotta get you thinking =]|`|pTDHiydcaa	idk, i think its kinda stupid though, wen i wuz a kid i liked the color blue better, iv always hated the color pink
ePt4qPxNaa	Obviously you got feelings for him. <br>  <br>  Dam i wish i had a dream with my P.E teacher =)|`|crHWAoaWaa	Yup! You got feelings for him. It happens to all of us.|`|PvAp83TWaa	Well, dreams are your minds way of converting covert and overt subconscious thoughts into review.<br>  <br>  Almost every dream has a meaning.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the content, and the feelings involved.<br>  <br>  For example, I dreamt that I was looking in the mirror only to find that my hair changed. And in my dream I loved my new hair!<br>  <br>  Checking on the site that I'll refer as my source, my interpretation to it was that I am in the phase of observing how much I have put efforts in my life to change. And the changes that I have made in my life has made me really successful.<br>  <br>  The mirror denoted the self-check. The new hair denoted 'change in onself'... The feeling of hapinness when I checked my hair denoted that I was happy with the changes in my life ;)<br>  <br>  Each dream has a personal and subconscious meaning..<br>  <br>  Most are very subtle.. And most dreams have to be decoded..<br>  <br>  With practice, you'll be able to decode almost every dream you have..<br>  <br>  You can also use these dreams to identify what really is bothering you right now.. Or what problems you are facing.. ;)
BB4Qd9ymaa	It's probably because when you keep your opinion to yourself, it doesn't have an impact on the world (not even in the slightest), making the opinioned person feel that they must share their opinion
dAkjYoVraa	Naturally everyone should be scared. The fear of death is what makes every animal survive. I personally don't try and think about it since it's one of those things you just can't control and spending valuable resources and time is just not worth it.|`|534a2bed725442955035a2a887d3d7c9aa	When your number is up, it is up. So why get freaked about death when there is nothing you can do about it! I have been very close to dying several times, and because of it, and the fact that my mom was a nurse who explained to me whatever i needed to know, up to and including death, so i have no fear about it whatsoever. I just hope that it is not painful, and is fairly quick.|`|UCgeFbjvaa	No, i am not scared because based on my spiritual, or you might call it supernatural experiences (there have been many) I believe that although the physical body ceases to function, the life giving energy that was inside the body is released into the celestial universe without all of the barriers that  r rule these earthly bodies.  So I am looking at it like a new birth into a new experience of which I am still me",  I can see, hear, Know, et., and communicate with<br>  others that have gone on before me, and be able to experience the wonders  and excitement of places and things that I can't even begin to imagine because of our earthly confines to the body.|`|a7M4V4Egaa	I'm actually looking forward to it. I don't want it to occur unnaturally, but I'm very excited to figure out what happens next. So no, I don't fear death itself, I do fear if I have to die painfully, though.|`|JeMHtc0zaa	Not really. Life scares me more.|`|nf2vpDCUaa	terrified, and it constantly runs through my head like a speeding train about to hit me. i really don't want to die|`|VuGMOf4Caa	I say i'm excited, to see what happens after you die. <br>  But when the time comes to it, i will be terrified.|`|pUWszP1Uaa	Yes...but I shouldn't be, because I'm immortal. :)|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	No, when my time comes it comes, there is nothing i can do about it so whats to be scared of ??? =\ <br>  I think when you die you just die thats it your brain switches off and you loose everything, you don't think anymore!!! When your dying it i supose to be peacefull, my nana died before (she got resusitated and brought back to life lol) she said she felt really peacefull and at one. Im not sure about the life flashing before you thing but i hope that does happen as that would be lovely to see everything you have done the good and bad times xxx<br>  Good question x<br>   <br>  ]x =] Have a wkd sunday [= x|`|LGKCNa70aa	Although i am only 14 when I think about death for too long it scares me, it terrifies me to the point that I am shaking and crying. I can't imagine not existing, will it be painful? I expect I have a long life ahead of me but already I am freaked beyong imagination just thinking of it...|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes, very much so. Especially after seeing my uncle die of a massive heart attack in my father's car.|`|H4GM9kWyaa	The fact that I'd be dead.. no<br>  The people I'd be leaving behind is a worry though|`|stzEUKfxaa	not of death... I'm really a proud and selfish person.<br>  f.e. at situation like a bank rob, when people who I love/respect/care were involved, I could/would try to stop the robbers, realizing that I defenitly fail and die. but ronly in such extreme situations when theres no other way... but I'm afraid of pain. physically pain. some people doesn't know how bad it can be... it drives you insane X_X|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	not really.. <br>  I think when we die it is for some reason.. it can be argueable i know.. for instance should a women die for some reason at birth but if she may have lived all sorts of things could have gone wrong with her life and we dont know it but to answer your question im not scared..<br>  im only scared if it brings pain.. e.g. i dont want to die from drowning (that is probably my worst fear)|`|AA11832714	I think that Everybody is scared about death.<br>   I have known People that are about to die, and most accept the fact and are at ease with the eventuality of death.<br>   I guess everybody is different.|`|yfoNIRRvaa	i dunno, i think death will be natural, like growing old, something that just slips by you.<br>  i'll be interesting to see whats on the other side,|`|eykCjMNdaa	Everybody dies sometime... I just try  to make the best of my life while I'm still here.|`|6jWdhjvsaa	Not scared of death but scared of coming back to this world as someone i would want to be for example a fly|`|cC5foIYoaa	YES.....i am! what is waiting for u after u die????<br>  that is what i want to know?<br>  :)|`|MNPWJPWhaa	no<br>  <br>  itll feel like nuffing<br>  <br>  no

9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	clarify: you mean specifically we should have MORE female role models than men or do you just mean we should have more female role models than there are now?<br>  <br>  Okay ideas for arguments:<br>  <br>  1. Females are generally underrepresented in stuff such as our science books and history books. There are also underrepresented in sitcoms/movies and childrens books/shows. So we need more to make up for the disadvantage women have had over the years.<br>  <br>  2. Having more female role models will not make men put women down as much. Like, "you throw like a girl." Instead boys may start looking up to women.<br>  <br>  3. If there were more female role models than men maybe we would achieve equal legal rights. For example, maybe direct combat positions will become open to women because of all the capable things female role models will be show to do.<br>  <br>  None of this is an endorsement by the way, just some ideas. ;) GL.|`|vEj7xoBraa	what kind of stupid debate is that? they are both equally important.<br>  <br>  do you know what happens to boys without male role models?|`|nvH62xo5aa	we don't need any more role models, we just need GOOD role models who don't take their clothes off for attention. it's not quantity, it's QUALITY|`|asja3rk7aa	because, if men ruled the world, it would be great, lapdances, beer, FUN, and women would have so much to complain about which would be so annoying<br>  <br>  but if women ruled the world, men couldnt say anything to the women about their decisions, because the women would just annihilate us, because they hate anything fun, and then they would make us their slaves, and make it their planet<br>  <br>  ya dig?|`|qVmIokXPaa	Forget it ; if your school is permitting such ludicrous, ******** activities & subject matter, there's no wonder why students there are failing to receive a PROPER eduation.. They obviously need a new superintendant & a new school board..|`|NNHdkLDWaa	The topic is kind of stupid.|`|ojV07FVdaa	It's not a shortage of potential role models. There are many hugely capable and successful women to choose from. Unfortunately the role models for young women tend to be more of the Paris Hilton ilk. <br>  <br>  I find it even more disturbing that this "debate" of yours is occuring at all. Is this your teacher's idea? There are startlingly sexist implications to the framing of this. Why is a school pitting one gender against the other in this fashion? The fundamental truth here is that a good role model is simply that. You can't legislate them. You can't create them out of the ether. If you insist on "equalising" some perceived gap you can really only do it by subtraction. <br>  <br>  There is a sad truth behind all this. Women get the role models they ask for. Their chosen role models are on view in the magazines and books women read. They are in the television they are the primary consumers of. They are in the retail spaces all around us. It's only pretty in soft focus and extensive makeup.<br>  <br>  This is, after all, something women have to do for themselves. Maybe if they lost their willingness to excuse and celebrate even the most deplorable behaviour by other women we may see a better quality female role model begin to emerge.

mVTGl6HGaa	In the United States and many other countries, even if an artifact or process is protected by trade secrets, reverse-engineering the artifact or process is often lawful as long as it is obtained legitimately. Patents, on the other hand, need a public disclosure of an invention, and therefore, patented items do not necessarily have to be reverse-engineered to be studied. One common motivation of reverse engineers is to determine whether a competitor's product contains patent infringements or copyright infringements.<br>  <br>  Reverse engineering software or hardware systems which is done for the purposes of interoperability (for example, to support undocumented file formats or undocumented hardware peripherals) is mostly believed to be legal, though patent owners often contest this and attempt to stifle any reverse engineering of their products for any reason.<br>  <br>  "...[W]here disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law."[12]|`|GllB4mPZaa	Where r u wondering.They are already doing it.

ibaLRXY2aa	1. When I was a teenager, I went on several missions trips with a really conservative Christian group. They made us girls wear t-shirts over our swimsuits so that we wouldn't "tempt" the boys. The boys, however, did not have to wear t-shirts. I went round and round with the director of the organization about this. I didn't mind wearing the t-shirt if it helped the boys spiritually, but I thought that they should have to wear them, too.<br>  <br>  2. Am I a slow-cooker? For the most part I am. I have had a couple of flings that were purely sexual with no strings attached, and they were fun. But for a more serious relationship, I want to make sure that the emotional connection is there before I start having sex with him.<br>  <br>  3. What's wrong with a little flirting? How else is a guy going to know you're interested if you don't flirt with him? I suppose whoever wrote this drivel thinks that the girl should just sit back and pray really hard that the boy she likes will notice her.<br>  <br>  4. Wow, a rat. That's harsh! <br>  <br>  5. The "Rochelle is a slut so she must be lying" disgusts me, but it doesn't surprise me.

I send my Christian friends to the website below which debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible. That way they have no excuse not to support comprehensive sex education.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, dressing modestly if you don't want to get men worked up looking at you seems reasonable.  I mean, obviously the more flesh you show the more excited a man is likely to get, why wouldn't he?  does anyone actually need to be told this?<br>  <br>  I was definitely a microwave, I used to ignite instantly if I saw a man I fancied.<br>  <br>  I never used to flirt much, on the whole I was too shy, but I could flirt if a man gave me a bit of encouragement.  It didn't come particularly easily to me though.<br>  <br>  Do those Missouri people not think men are rats too?  And if not then why not?<br>  <br>  Giving drunken men lifts home is probably not a good idea, if you don't want to get raped.  I mean, a drunken man is likely to be less in control of himself than a sober one, isn't he?

I am definitely not like that and I know the moment I see people whether I would shag them or not.

I wanted to have sex with my husband the first time I ever saw him in the mess and he didnt even see me as I was behind him and I said to my mate I am doing him before I leave (training for air force). Who would have thought we would get married haha. I was definitely only after 1 thing at that instant. I have also never understood why some people would say you should only have sex when your in a relationship? What if you need sex what are you meant to do?<br>  <br>  Men are going to think about doing girls when they look sexy the same as I go out clubbing and look at girls dressed up and want to do them.

crHWAoaWaa	Why, my Dear, yahoo would ban me if I really answered your question.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|jcX7g2Mcaa	make something or learn oragami<br>  go outside and do something<br>  read<br>  draw<br>  write a story|`|UCgeFbjvaa	I'm glad to know that there are other things that you would like to do because at first I thought if you were bored with everything that must mean that you were interesed in nothing which sounds like a whole lot of depression.  So it sounds to me like a case of time management.  We all have  things we want to do and can't because of important<br>  obligations that require our time like; working to provide our families with food, clothes, et.   Being a parent takes almost every bit of our time making sure to keep our children safe from harm, feeding them properly to keep them healthy,<br>  teaching them values and all the things we can to make sure they have skills to survive and thrive in an adult world not to mention Dr. appts and extra curr. activitities like sports or music and the list goes on and on.  So what do we do?  Well we have to find where we can take some time<br>  to  do what we want without hurting our main obligations.  That could be a few hours on maybe a Friday evening or maybe even a whole day or two on a weekend and once a year we may even get to go on a vacation.  .so this is life, and I think the trick is finding the right time spaces to fit in with what we must do and making it balance so everything<br>  works for our good.  one example might be to get up an extra hour early and study so you can have an hour later in  the evening for just you.  Only you know how much time you need for that something you really want to do, so see if you can creatively come up to a balance such as one hour of your special time for every three hours of study time, after all,  you deserve it!

No. I think bisexual women are more out about their sexuality then bisexual men. I do believe that a lot lesbian and bisexual women's sexuality is fluid, at least more fluid then gay men's. Meaning that they may be straight for a while and then lesbian. <br>  If a woman is straight then she is straight. Women don't do anything for her physically. They don't like the same parts. I have met too many straight women, and they don't like the idea of lesbianism. Same thing with straight men, we aren't attracted to the same parts we have.<br>  I'm pretty sure straight people don't fantasize about the same gender either because I don't.<br>  No, someone who is straight will always be straight.  I don't believe people turn bi or gay.  They just come to terms with it.<br>  Some people do live in denial though.  Some will admit the attraction, but they don't like to label themselves.  It can be confusing.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	No not all women are bisexual. Some are very straight.

vhlORK4Waa	Postcolonialism (postcolonial theory, post-colonial theory) is a somewhat fuzzy intellectual discourse that holds together a set of theories found among the texts and sub-texts of philosophy, film, political science and literature. These theories are reactions to the cultural legacy of colonialism.<br>  <br>  As a literary theory (or critical approach), it deals with literature produced in countries that once were colonies of other countries, especially of the European colonial powers Britain, France, and Spain; in some contexts, it includes countries still in colonial arrangements. It also deals with literature written in colonial countries and by their citizens that has colonized people as its subject matter. Colonized people, especially of the British Empire, attended British universities; their access to education, still unavailable in the colonies, created a new criticism - mostly literary, and especially in novels. <br>  <br>  Following the breakup of the Soviet Union during the late 20th century, its former republics became the subject of this study as well. <br>  <br>  Postcolonialism deals with cultural identity in colonised societies: the dilemmas of developing a national identity after colonial rule; the ways in which writers articulate and celebrate that identity (often reclaiming it from and maintaining strong connections with the coloniser); the ways in which the knowledge of the colonised (subordinated) people has been generated and used to serve the coloniser's interests; and the ways in which the coloniser's literature has justified colonialism via images of the colonised as a perpetually inferior people, society and culture. <br>  <br>  These inward struggles of identity, history, and future possibilities often occur in the metropolis and, ironically, with the aid of postcolonial structures of power, such as universities. Not surprisingly, many contemporary postcolonial writers reside in London, Paris, New York and Madrid.<br>  <br>  The creation of binary opposition structures the way we view others. In the case of colonialism, the Oriental and the Westerner were distinguished as different from each other (i.e. the emotional, decadent Orient vs. the principled, progressive Occident). This opposition justified the "white man's burden," the coloniser's self-perceived "destiny to rule" subordinate peoples. <br>  <br>  In contrast, post-colonialism seeks out areas of hybridity and transculturalization. This aspect is particularly relevant during processes of globalization.<br>  <br>  Hope this  helps<br>  Halcon
1WS4vTdcaa	Phobia don't make conventional logical sense a lot of the time.  That's why they can be so scary because you can't explain it to yourself.  However, there is usually some logic to it if you know what events and thoughts led to the creation of the phobia.  That's not always necessary, but sometimes it helps.<br>  <br>  For instance, one of my clients had a phobia of flying which he really couldn't understand because he had been fine as a child.  Under hypnosis we found that it all stemmed from his father telling him on one flight to put his teddy bear (comforting toy he took everywhere) in the hold luggage rather than on to the plane as hand luggage.  Being without his teddy bear made him feel uncomfortable and vulnerable but he associated it with the plane so ended up with a phobia of planes.<br>  <br>  So, sometimes it is a direct experience, at other times it can be related to something else.  Horror movies are often a culprit and if you have a good imagination it can be easy to imagine yourself in that scenario.<br>  <br>  It could be that your phobia isn't about elephants, it's just about large animals that are out of control.  Possibly the memory of the ear flicking your leg made you realise how powerful an elephant can be which wouldn't be pleasant if one was coming towards you.|`|8UozWw0Paa	maybe something happened that you can't actually recall... like you watched a show on elephants and you were mortified or something. <br>  maybe you remember seeing the elephants as good, when in fact it wasn't a positive experience at all. sometimes memory can become distorted when we want it to - i believed i hated cheese and had done all my life, until i saw a photograph of myself happily scoffing cheese as a kid lol.<br>  not saying this is the case, it just can be.|`|q2zbgFDOaa	from reading this you seem to be afraid of them walking towards you<br>  im not suprised!<br>  they're pretty big animals, and can do a LOT of damage<br>  hence why you get scared of the elephants in jungle book MARCHING, and when dumbo's mum goes mental,<br>  you're kinda afraid for your safety|`|jcX7g2Mcaa	well, maybe it just happend. there is no exact answer to this question. you will probably need to go to a someone specialized in human psycology to know the exact answer<br>  dont worry. theres nothing to really help. its a fear of elephants. thats all.

fofzdoROaa	How is not the correct word for answering this question. Progress in macroeconomics occurs when there is sufficient demand for goods that companies that are involved in the supply of produced goods or the services associated with them, need to expand. After some expansion the greater amount of employment necessary is likely to raise the amount of money needed (without inflation) and demand. If the prices are not allowed to rise (unlikely, due to some real inflation) then the progress will continue.

I even spent several years volunteering as a patient advocate at a clinic.   <br>  <br>  I really think a woman's medical decisions should be between her and her doctor.   88% of abortions are done before the 12th week and 65% done at the embryonic stage- not even a fetus.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	You appear to be confused between feminists and pro-choice activists, and children and foetuses.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|nvH62xo5aa	you can't stop someone from being able to have children, unfortunately.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	Only to the degree that the KKK and other extremists should be allowed to raise children. <br>  <br>  Radical feminists are anti-family, as demonstrated many times e.g. <br>  "In order to raise children with equality, we must take them away from families and communally raise them." <br>  Dr. Mary Jo Bane, feminist and assistant professor of education at Wellesley College and associate director of the school's Center for Research on Woman (Source: Quoted by Dolores Barclay, Associate Press writer, Tulsa World, August 21, 1977.)<br>  <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Betty/Freauf106.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswithviews.com/Betty/Freau...</a><br>  <br>  Clearly I don't think these people would make good parents and will only mess up the minds of any children they raise.|`|3ggolLgQaa	Personally I hate radical feminists. JUST the radical ones.<br>  <br>  Why? Because alot of them believe that men and women should live separately and that heterosexual relationships are bad.<br>  Don't they ever question their own existence? THEY are a result of a heterosexual relationship!<br>  But its not up to me to decide whether they should have children or not. <br>  <br>  As for abortion, I am for it.<br>  <br>  My grandmother, who was raised in a country which did not allow contraception or abortion, had 16 children.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine being pregnant all of your life?<br>  Why shouldn't a woman be able to plan when she wants a baby?<br>  Why shouldn't she be able to get rid of something in HER body which is going to stop her from achieving her dreams?|`|NmQCYizTaa	Pro choice argues the RIGHT for a mother to abort her foetus, it doesn't mean a woman would do so herself, or that she would do so without good reason. Feminists can be stable and loving, and nobody is arguing anything about hating foetuses - theres not really anything to hate. Theyre arguing about loving pregnant women, or at least respecting their choices. <br>  <br>  However, arguing that other people who are in totally different situations to you can never know better or make a choice you personally condemn.. hm, Id say that has more hate.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	I don't think children are safe with feminist mothers so perhaps some restrictions are needed.<br>  <br>  I have heard that in America little babies are being dumped in bins and skips as if they were garbage.

TXyFtQ9uaa	Like all emotions they have their role to play within the lives of all individuals, however like anything else that we humans use in life they have to be controlled, For Jealousy is a natural reaction that we experience when we feel that we have been deprived of something, our progress in life has been halted or our rights have been infringed upon, for If we see someone who finds things easier to do than ourselves or we lack the means or power to obtain things for ourselves that we deeply yearn for we all may experience this emotion to what ever degree we do, in the right hands this can be a powerful tool to motivate one to acheive their goals in life provided we have the means to do so, but if left unchecked this is literally the key to pandora's box so to speak where we see all the evils that mankind is capable of when he seeks a means to an end by any means at their disposal.|`|STumBiU0aa	i think its normal to be a little jealous sometimes as long as its not too much.  I am jealous every so often thats normal|`|Df7TDBfXaa	It is a selfish feeling, you should feel happy for a person , but everybody has been jelous of something atleast once in their lives .It is natural but we should think of those less fortunate of us as well.|`|Kv3GqU9Zaa	jealously is a bad emotion as it causes to put yourself down and wanting what otherpeople have, like many i have had experience jealousy and its not pretty<br>  but jealously is a human emotion and we all have to try and put it off<br>  :)|`|2110e52656cc4fd2a02ef5e434b9aec8aa	Everyone gets jealous.

Do we like to get the feeling that others jealous us? The definition of jealousy is the anger occurred at someone being (or my feeling) that person better than myself. Simply jealousy person does not tolerate other persons success, happiness, beauty, talent etc. So is not it a defilement that we all have? Should not we get rid of that? I think we should. We should be conscious in such a way that jealousy does not overcast our mind and deeds.There are so many evil things happen in the world due to jealousy. It is a clear defective feeling which occurs due to unawareness. The definite path to get rid of this feeling is to practice the opposite of jealousy i.e. loving kindness or metta. If v cultivate wholesome feeling towards others we can enjoy others well being. So thats merit to ourselves. <br>  <br>  With metta,|`|R04LCYNPaa	Jealousy?? Of course I've ever had this feeling. According to me, jealousy is fine as long as we can still control our emotion when we have it. Sometimes, when we jealous we really want to be angry.

cXtEx98Haa	Yes, it happens to me a lot.  I think it happens to most people some, but to a few of us much more.<br>  <br>  If happens to me enough that I actually thought about establishing a web site where people could come and describe the person whose name (or place or whatever) they were trying to think of and other members would tell them.  <br>  <br>  As you know, it is frustrating as hell, even if you don't really "need" to know the person's name at that time.  You know tomorrow or later today or whatever it's going to pop right back in your mind, but you want it then.  You try to move through your memory to get to the right place, but until whatever causes this is gone, there's no getting to it.<br>  <br>  (Don't think it's significant, but I am also a Mensan, as you are or are at least qualified to be.)

itfeXDRCaa	(I hope you don't mind reading this all)Everyone has dreams. They don't always remember it when they wake up so it seems like you didn't have a dream. Dreams sometimes can relate to your mood or what's happening in your life. ( I have said this to ppl b4) Maybe you dream had something to do with what happened in real life that you might remember? If oyu want something or want to help something/someone your dream you could be related to that. yours seems kind of confusing. Yours looks like it has something to do with pollution or polluted water or something. Something could have happened that had something do to with water before that you maybe didn't like. Or liked. Some people think some dreams you had occurred in the past life if reincarnation exists. That could have happened how long ago or something like that. I don't really think reincarnation exists. If you don't know, I'm sure you do, it's when someone dies they sort of come back to life as maybe another person, animal or something with no memory of their past life or past lives. Dreams also could mean you are under stress. It all depends on what dream you have.
vV36joSUaa	say sorry i've laready organised to go with someone else|`|NWzIE6BWaa	He really isn't your friend then bro. So grow some balls and tell him that he is to much of a pussy to go.|`|ruamFLoiaa	Tell him that you are afraid that you won't get along on the trip and that it won't be pleasant for either of you.  I assume you have had this experience with him before, perhaps you can provide examples of past disagreements you have had.  Couch it this way, that you want to preserve the friendship and you have learned that traveling with others can sometimes ruin friendships.  Is that helpful?|`|cTvP6j7Haa	No sorry's, no excuses, no lies,  Just: "I don't want you along!"<br>  Peace.|`|S93OYsN9aa	Well, if you want them to come just tell them, LOOk we are NOT doing this this or this, and we're going to have fun and NOT argue...if you really don't want them to come at all, say sry but i think i'm going to take "So and so" instead...then honestly explain why.....Or you could always think of an excuse, and lie...lol|`|1y8Qrx0zaa	Straight up tell them what the problem is.<br>  If you like this person, tell them that you'll go some place with them at another time.If you don't want to go away with them, then you should probably lie nicely..|`|uolXLnKwaa	i am having some personal issues, i only want one friend to come along. ill explain to you later. im sorry.<br>  <br>  <br>  then go out and have a ball :D|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Say, "Sorry, I'd rather go alone this time."

YCDS4Am8aa	honestly no because you don't want to pass those genetics to your children and you don't know when he will crack and possibly hurt you.  it sound like this guy is autistic which means he doesnt have connection with reality at all times it will be tough and a burden.. i dont want to be rude or mean but stay as friends|`|9ydlIWUNaa	no, i wouldn't but if you knew him for a very long time, you would know him well enough whether or not to trust and date them.<br>  if you think you can trust him, go for it, but i would be very observant and check for any fishy behaviour.|`|3FfPHRGtaa	hmmm....do you think he has mental health problems just because he keeps rocking back and forth all the time, and he is very quiet?<br>  <br>  maybe that is just his personality and habit. he might be actually sane. like for me, i'm a pretty socially retarded person. i'm like a human vibrator, always shaking. but i'm fine.<br>  <br>  i would go for the date, in the case where my date is weird but sane. but he has mental issues you are not mentioning in your question, i will think twice about it. maybe be his friend, but not get too attached.|`|hktbfRPWaa	Personality is what should count. If you like him what does it matter?<br>  <br>  Mental health problems can also cover a very wide range of things and may not really have any effect on the person at all, in which case it would be stupid to say you wouldn't date someone with mental health problems|`|q4tTabfjaa	Depends on why he is rocking back and fore.<br>  Was it a brain tumor or damage?<br>  How far have you got to know him first?<br>  I would be a friend.  If you fancy him, weigh up the odds and make your own decision.|`|pkZBBvlzaa	hell no|`|f1qdLCSiaa	why not, if you like him you should give him a chance. Don't discriminate against people because of a disability they may be a really great person. You may however want to find out about his condition, what it is etc, so that you can learn more about it and know how to handle it/ acccept it or just for your own understanding.|`|0uSPPAb5aa	As long as his mental health does not hurt anyone or you why not? It is not that uncommon of a person to rock ,Its no worse than sucking your thumb . If it goes deeper you have to decide, if you can handle what they are like and go from there.|`|AgBH66nJaa	I have and he was lovely, if you like this guy then go for it!

gJYo9Uotaa	What you really need to do is sit down and rethink your logic here. You need to make up your mind about your feelings towards her, otherwise it can be disastrous to both you and her.  <br>  <br>  If she ended it, she would have to have had a reason. Think about that too. Closure is nice, but not always appropriate.<br>  <br>  And lastly, just to be original... Tell her how you feel. Who knows? She may recognize your feelings and return them.|`|8sWaWQWGaa	I think you still have feelings for her just wait until you get around her and see what happens. She probably has been thinking about you and waiting for you to come back to her!|`|STumBiU0aa	It sounds like you are not infact over her after all.  i find that when it comes to relationships time heals all wounds.|`|8133e099706de713a35f0bf1e2c11673aa	I'm sorry but you definately do not seem to be over her. <br>  <br>  Are you feeling guilty for how you treated her when you were together and would like to make up to her? <br>  <br>  Does she still like you?? Could you make a go of it again?<br>  <br>  If the feelings are not mutual then you HAVE to avoid her as much as possible and start enjoying your own life without her. You'll meet someone else and you can do all these nice things you have thought about with your new love.  This will be the perfect remedy.
qEy34ueZaa	Everyone is at various degrees. I am intrigued it is not "dying" what scares people, since there is a 100% guaranty of that happening, but rather the following:<br>  1. Not knowing the moment.<br>  2. The possible amount of pain involved, and the duration of it.<br>  3. The unknown on the other side (for some of us), and the fear that haven and hell may be a reality after all. I would be scared too, if I were not a believer.|`|zCHnMeXbaa	Nope, I plan on dying one night.|`|28d07970c3adc9d81a00eeb71a258aa1aa	Yes. I am still young.

I'm young tho.  SO i've probably got awhile.  Why fear the inevitable?  <br>  <br>  A side note, I do wonder how i'm going to die tho.|`|fsiXYWEvaa	I am alright with it|`|hgNXQbJsaa	It'll come. <br>  <br>  Why worry?|`|uaHzhUeoaa	No. I wouldn't want to live forever, because I would probably end up in a vegitative state, and then I would be stuck in constant numbness, and probably fall into oblivion. :) Death is when I finally get to be eternally happy, and if you ask me, it's just another step in existing.|`|YhKjDu1yaa	if you read the bible is says that GOD created man and breathed the breath of life into him your spirit came from GOD and it will return to GOD who gave it when you die because of adam s sins  that's rebelling against GOD  SO THEREFORE  every man after adam will die physical and spiritually  because of sin its like being born with a defect sin comes naturally to man  but the good news is that JESUS died on the cross for our sins  if you believe that he made us right with GOD and spiritually redeemed us from the pits of hell where satan  is|`|dYLwFmiwaa	not yet. <br>  <br>  i have 80% of my life to live, when i know i am close to death i will accept it, but right now in my life i refuse.|`|WIfXoZlZaa	i used to be terrified by the concept of death.

d5Z21bnVaa	I hate when people project their emotions on to me. That pisses me off. I try not to have people do that, the way I feel is I feel at the time and I will show my positive emotions. I suppress my anger and think about it when I am alone, so that I don't become a hypocrite and project my negative feelings on to others. <br>  <br>  I think its because you haven't encountered such negative people but you should not take it out on others. Let them be as they are, its kind of obvious that they aren't as happy as you are and others. Also if you change now, your life will lose side of track.
AA11731361	First thing first, you are NOT worthless. You are someone whom others would like to get to know. You are someone who deserves a friendship and also someone who will care for others someday and it will seem worth it. Don't dwell in the stinkin' thinkin' land. The Pity Party is over. Which leads me to reality #1:<br>  <br>  First, forget whatever has ever happened to you is in the past. I know that may be difficult amd seems insensitve & crass, but it is the only way to move on. When you dwell on the past hurts, you become the victim all over again. You mention a faith in God. Good!  He says to give ALL to Him including the hurting and sadness. His way to overcome is to look back, forgive the wrongdoer and then look forward and move on. You cannot do anything anymore. God will deal with them. Trust me in this.<br>  <br>  Second is to again look upon God in His word for confort. He will guide you. Again, trust me. and Trust Him! What you need is HOPE. And He is Hope b/c He has seen the future and knows the answers to all the important things you need to decide on. <br>  <br>  Third, you need to smile. Try it. it helps to think of a funny image. I like that barbarian washing himself with the windshield squeegie at the gas pumps on the Capital One commercials. Makes me laugh all the time. You will notice that your attitude will change. Don't dwell on past thoughts and look towards your promising future. <br>  <br>  Fourth, you are your own person. You are not your mom. Seek a career in what you enjoy (that also makes money). And don't talk back to mom as she doesn't want to hear it and you also need to forgive her as she's trying to save you from *her past mistake*. Which then would be mistake #2. That is not going to work. A perant can only lead by example and not by their mouth.<br>  <br>  As for your family life, when you live with your parent(s), you need to obey their rules WHICH does include doing chores so do them. And yeah, don't do drugs OR drinking. Those can ruin your life. How can dong them ever help positiviely? Why take the chance?<br>  <br>  Back to your mom. Sit her down and tell her the facts in a quiet soothing tone. Tell her that you love her and care for your opinions. Tell her that you don't want to make any desicions that *you* (not her) will regret later as she did. And then tell her that even though she always wanted to be a medical person, you do not and that it actually makes you ill thinking of it. And ask her, 'do you want me to make a decision now that I will later regret and then force my own child later in life to change their life decision which will make them force their own childres into submission? How is that reasonable? How is that healthy?" Tell her you are still young and the world is your stage and the curtain hasn't gone up yet. Tell her that you will consider everything she asks of you but demanding things will only drive a wedge between you two and that you do NOT want that nor would she. Ask her, "do you want us to move apart?" and hopefully she'll say no.<br>  <br>  I could say more but think about all of this but soak this in. and ALSO PRAY!! like all the time. God will lead you to a proper decision. I also have asked Him to as well for you.|`|QFG0yu24aa	you definitely need to see a counsellor or therapist. really, you will feel a lot better.

ruamFLoiaa	I have dated men who are like that, not wanting to talk or be touched when they are in a bad mood.

But everyone is different.|`|XrydQDRBaa	I usually try pissing off other people with my words, but not in a really harsh way. I don't like to many people talking to me at once or telling me what to do without a please, or asking multiple times. I'm not the one to get violent but I do hit things when I start to tense up to much. Sometimes I like talking but it has to be about something that won't annoy me. Touching has never really been something that that bothered me when I'm in a bad mood.|`|NWzIE6BWaa	I have seen all types of men in bad moods. Some cope with games, going out and running, or talking with other men on their problem after a period of time. Personally, It depends on the guy if he will listen and every guy will not mind being touched on a sexual level, but I don't know about someone tapping them or something along those lines while they are angry. The ones you have to worry about are the ones that do not communicate well in an argument and do not leave. They will most likely not be able to get rid of their stress and may turn their in-ability to cope with anger toward you.

Cheaper too. <br>  <br>  I tend to Act, Hide, Ignore, Re-Appear, Analyze like mad, Reflect, Adjust, Amend, and then hopefully move on. <br>  <br>  All of the above can be done in five minutes or 15 years. Same process for me, just different timing. <br>  <br>  I am a lonely person by nature. I like that.

PvAp83TWaa	Well, dreams are your minds way of converting covert and overt subconscious thoughts into review.<br>  <br>  Almost every dream has a meaning.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the content, and the feelings involved.<br>  <br>  For example, I dreamt that I was looking in the mirror only to find that my hair changed. And in my dream I loved my new hair!<br>  <br>  Checking on the site that I'll refer as my source, my interpretation to it was that I am in the phase of observing how much I have put efforts in my life to change. And the changes that I have made in my life has made me really successful.<br>  <br>  The mirror denoted the self-check. The new hair denoted 'change in onself'... The feeling of hapinness when I checked my hair denoted that I was happy with the changes in my life ;)<br>  <br>  Each dream has a personal and subconscious meaning..<br>  <br>  Most are very subtle.. And most dreams have to be decoded..<br>  <br>  With practice, you'll be able to decode almost every dream you have..<br>  <br>  You can also use these dreams to identify what really is bothering you right now.. Or what problems you are facing.. ;)|`|84fd7e4798193628f44c8efd477cee2caa	keep up with your art
AFAegaNGaa	The problem isnt with being gay, it is that when you heard him say you'll turn gay, you figured at that time gay wasn't favorable and must be bad and unacceptable to men for it seemed obvious to you that he didn't like it.<br>   You really had no idea what gay really meant and you created  search loop in your mind which will forever ask the same question with the same amount of information getting the same result.<br>   Either your gay or not, doesnt matter, what matters is that you didn't turn into some unacceptable creature that you had imagined turning gay meant.<br>   Get over it, move on, those wasted energy drains are by choice, time to turn off those loops and limitaions and take your rightful place within our species.|`|NWzIE6BWaa	Good luck with finding out who you are.|`|1y8Qrx0zaa	Advice is not what you need.<br>  What you need is a notepad and a pen.<br>  Write EVERYTHING that runs through your mind down on paper.<br>  And please, don't feed me a story about how 'I'm gay now! my life is over!'<br>  If you were meant to be gay, you were gay from the start.<br>  If you weren't, you aren't.<br>  Do whatever feels right and trust your instinct not what the millions of other people are telling you.<br>  <br>  My inbox is open if you have questions or need to talk.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	It doesn't sound to me like you have OCD. But being gay is a choice. Don't let someone else's thoughts mess you up. You can be whoever you want to be. Guys were made to be attracted to girls and vice versa. Anything other than that is something that is chosen. Many people think it is inborn, but in the end it is your choice. Choose wisely.
D4ot0qLpaa	For me, it's to really, truly, and seriously not give a damn about anyone else's expectations or rules for how your life is supposed to be run. This is much, much, much harder than it sounds.<br>  <br>  "To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting." ~ e. e. cummings|`|Fy8BWFG2aa	id say truly just help people when u know you should and dont mind what people say. we often do mean things off what angers us i guess if u learn not to care then it could help

He would receive a check for himself and all children under 16.<br>  Check out that as well as asking your local Church's for help with food until your family is able to get more money coming in, this way you can save the money for your Dads Medicine.<br>  Good Luck and I hope you Dad gets Well soon and by helping your Mom it will make a big difference, take over once in a while and tell your mom you've got things covered for a bit so she can go soak in a nice hot bath at the end of the day to relax a little :)

cWuumdy7aa	In economics, Aggregate Expenditure is a measure of national income. Basically, it is an approach to measure GDP. It is defined as the value of planned goods and services produced in an economy. Where GDP is defined as C + I + G + NX and I = Ip + Iu (planned + unplanned investment), Aggregate Expenditures is defined as C + Ip + G + NX, where:<br>  <br>  C= consumption (C) I= investment G= government spending NX= net exports (Exports-Imports)<br>  <br>  AE (Aggregate Expenditure) is used in conjunction with GDP in the Aggregate Expenditures Model to predict future GDP direction. In this model, when AE = GDP then the economy is in equilibrium. According to this model an economy will move towards its equilibrium causing changes in the GDP.<br>  <br>  AE is also used in the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply Model which advances the Aggregate Expenditures Model with the inclusion of Price changes.<br>  <br>  Some textbooks choose to define aggregate expenditures as the sum of consumption and investment in a closed, private economy, dealing exclusively with amounts firms intend to invest, and not necessarily taking into account amounts that will actually be invested.<br>  <br>  Components of Aggregate Expenditure (AE) - defined as the total amount that firms and households plan to spend on goods and services at each level of income. Also, it can be seen that the aggregate expenditure is the sum of expenditures on consumption, investment, government expenses and net exports. It is normally derived from all the components of the AD. For instance:<br>  <br>  AD=C+I+G+X-M (function of price) AE=C+I+G+X-M (function of income) (DR Kevin LTL)

I have got a great one of the Eiffel Tower with blue skies behind it, as well as the Obelisco in Buenos Aires on a similar day.  I have some really photogenic and colourful pictures of the Albuquerque hot air balloon fiesta, and a lovely photo of the China Grill in Miami as the red colours of the sunset reflected off its ocre walls.  I also have a crepuscular picture of the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas as the sunset reflected off its copper-coloured glass and shimmered on the waters in the foreground.|`|fofzdoROaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so this is a very subjective question.<br>  <br>  What is beautiful for me is the quality of the model of a physical relationship between many parts of a system in terms of the associated mathematics. So what looks like a set of equations is in fact a representation of a theory that is so perfect that it leaves one (who understands) gasping at its subtly and form. Personally I find macroeconomics equations to qualify for this picture, but many of the physical scientists would (for example) better appreciate the more famous:  E = m.c^2 .

BoSaeaCVaa	I wish I could help, but I am a fairly apathetic person. So things like this aren't' a problem for me.<br>  <br>  Other then that, I'd say put yourself in another person's shoes when you react a certain way. The person (or people) you are with tend to be targets for anger, reasons for embarrassment, etc. So think about how you would feel if your friend got angry at you for something you are getting angry at them for. Then ask yourself if it is reasonable?<br>  If you think they are talking behind your back, then think about what they could be talking about. Is there actually anything they could talk about? Would you talk behind their backs like that?<br>  <br>  If you wouldn't, they probably aren't either. And if you wouldn't like it, they probably wouldn't either. Just follow the simple rule: do unto others what you would have them do unto you.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Use some body language to show how you feel if you can't speak up and tell them.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who was always bragging on herself and trying to make me feel like I was less than dirt, and I got sick of it and didn't know how to handle it either.  But just didn't encourage the friendship any more.  Then others tried to bring us together and that didn't help anything.  She got married to a minister 10 years older than her and had 3 children quickly I think, and then he decided to leave the ministry because he couldn't bring in enough money to support his family.   God knows everything about us and he eventually smooths it out if we obey him all the time.|`|ruamFLoiaa	I am assuming you are young and will grow out of some of that.  It is a part of adolescence, to deal with those kind of things.  <br>  <br>  It is always hurtful when others don't like you or talk about you behind your back.  There will always be people who don't like you.  It's just a part of life.  As is, unfortunately, that some people enjoy gossiping about others.  It isn't that you shouldn't care about this, it is just that it is unavoidable to some degree.  <br>  <br>  You just have to be kind to yourself and others.  It does get easier as you get older.
QFG0yu24aa	it sounds like you want objective advice. the best person for this is an agent who represents bands similar to yours. an agent has got nothing to gain by telling you that your music is great if they do not like it, unless they say it in an offhand way just to get you off their back.
9IYrqe7Haa	Not if your positivity is a lie than its dishonesty and the truth is the only way to live. happiness will not come from a lie. Though if it is true positivity i believe it can help can help though only temporarily as the person you are trying to be strong for needs to get help for them self as i am a believer that a person must help them self.

6qPTQDdZaa	I don't think you're ever going to see a lot of men in elementary schools simply because a lot of men don't want to do it.  Society also says that women are better with younger kids, which just magnifies that.  There are men teachers in high school, but even that tends to be dominated by women.  It's not until you get to college that you really see it even out.  Maybe men just don't want to deal with anyone's kids but their own.<br>  <br>  I have to agree with Olisbos for once.  All teachers need more pay.  We can all argue it, but the fact is men are still expected to be the primary breadwinners in families by society, and it's nearly impossible to do that and be a teacher, which is a big reason men teachers tend to marry women teachers.|`|u0udwkZQaa	I disagree with that logic being a guy that went to a primary school with only women teachers. Primary school age is too young to let sexual gender get into it. If you had said secondary school I would agree there needs to be men, however, secondary school is where most men tend to teach because they are more into educating and less into kids. Women tend to prefer teaching because they like kids, so you tend to get more in primary school and nurseries. Mainly women in primary school&nursery is perfect, and mainly men in secondary/higher is also about right for boys to do well. If you want to do something to change boys being distracted, make secondary schools same sex. Primary is not an issue. When boys are primary school age, women teachers can be scary, just like it's usually the mother who controls the kids in a marriage discipline-wise. Once boys really enter puberty, and secondary school, that is when testosterone kicks in and boys may take women teachers less seriously as authority/disciplinary figures.|`|MvDu7hZmaa	If you want more male teachers, (which I agree<br>  with, BTW), a campaign to sell the profession <br>  would be required.  Education requires some <br>  good old fashioned public relations.  Men need<br>  to know more about the professional demands <br>  of all educators.  Presently, they may view primary<br>  education as mere babysitting, although it takes<br>  knowledge and great skill to give youngsters<br>  an academic foundation that is sound and effective.<br>  The profession requires greater respect from the<br>  public at large.  It would also help if educators<br>  were more in touch with both higher and lower<br>  grades.  The system is divided and not enough<br>  connections are made to value elementary <br>  education as the foundation for future <br>  academic success.|`|5881d0db3420625300aecd1cf7107d5daa	I think putting adverts on TV and in newspapers would work.<br>  Like those adverts about teaching where they actually make it look fun! Definitely not higher pay for males. I don't think they should choose a man over a woman is the woman is better, but head teachers or governors or whoever pick the teachers shouldn't automatically think a woman would be better, so adverts could also aim to change other people's perception of male primary school teachers. Like people often think men who want to be primary school teachers must be overly feminine and caring, gay or a pervert, but there are probably lots of men who are neither of those and would make good teachers and might want to be one but don't because of what other people think! I think that primary school children, especially boys, need some male teachers as male role models. In secondary school it's more equal but I only had one male teacher in all of primary school!|`|CHlxBbkHaa	Why does it matter?  Do you have a male/female quota you're trying to fill?  People go where they want.  My uncle likes teaching grade 5 & 6.  Some prefer older.  Some prefer younger.  If there is no place for the guy to go then he won't apply.|`|c77cjTOeaa	Salaries for all teachers, regardless of gender, should be raised to attract the best people. Poor pay is what keeps men away.  That and kids who have no respect for authority.|`|NUGErTlzaa	When I was in school, I had a pretty even mix of female and male teachers...and this continued all into high school and college. There are male teachers and they are some pretty good educators.|`|9EoV0ppmaa	Personally, I don't propose to do this, but then again I'm not Ed Balls|`|he7B6SYgaa	My friend is a male and once a school teacher and a very good and respected one. He decided to quit the profession because he said he had to watch every move he made, every comment, every action to make sure he was not accused of a crime. He said it got so bad that he would not allow a student to get closer than 4 feet from him. He would not walk down the aisle to look at work. He made sure that another teacher was around at all times during recess. he actually took a video camera to work for self protection.|`|AHJZeo8Oaa	Marx - Affirmative Action for women is illegal in the UK due to the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act, so I disagree that women have benefitted from it before.<br>  <br>  However, the new Equalities Bill will, for the first time, allow for positive discrimination where employers wish to 'balance' their employment teams - which would allow schools to hire more male teachers if they wished (the Equalities Bill only enables it, not enforces it)  :-)|`|ZYp1AEspaa	I don't. Teachers who have been bribed into entering the profession shouldn't be there; they aren't just conveying information, they're role models for our children in their formative years.|`|6bMBwaosaa	Well my question would be - do you need to? Yes it would be good for male pupils in particular to have a positive role model but do you really want to bribe people into the profession with extra money ? Teachers should teach because it is their vocation and they love it.|`|emOhSyY5aa	there is no way to increase this. males are just not taking education as a major in college as much as women are. i think this is because it is not worth the pay or the frustration that teachers have to go through.|`|xDom6mr3aa	I don't think men should teach Primary school kids, they don't have the same maternal side necessary to look after children. <br>  <br>  Sadly, its a woman's roll.

When asked why, the majority of men said a) Fear of being named a potential paedophile (by some of the fellow students, judging by the hateful rumours/gossiping) and b) the ridicule in general for daring to enter a woman's domain.<br>  <br>  SAM - I notice you have removed the block, and I shall gladly reciprocate :o)|`|Px79AEXtaa	Most men don't want to teach young kids.

Grade school was all women and high school was almost all men. There were a couple of female teachers in high school, but I never had a class with them. I did have some male gym teachers in grade school.|`|ndopqX6Taa	I think that even if men wanted the job the majority of times it would go to a woman. There is still a stigma on it and you would be surprised how many women it still concerns. And before anyone says I am crazy, as a single father it is sad because my daughter can not have sleepovers because certain mothers just won't let them. But they sleep over at the other friend's houses that are in my daughters group of friends. There are a couple mothers that trust me me taking their daughter to the hockey game, park, etc. with us but some do not even give it a chance.<br>  <br>  There is still a certain stigma with men and small children there. Whether you want to think it is there or not.|`|BkleL3F4aa	The suspicion surrounding men that work with children would have to dissipate.<br>  <br>  The numbers of male teachers started to drop off in the 70s, funnily enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  The abuse and education services should be inclusive and not run on feminist ideology.|`|61AjTvw7aa	A lot of men don't want these jobs. If more of them did there would be more male primary school teachers obviously.<br>  <br>  It's interesting that pedophiles on the other hand actively seek out jobs and other activities in which they can be close to children.

During some bad moments in life you tend to think about such things. To motivate myself when I feel down I always envisage my dream future (beautiful woman and kids, happy job and so on) and try to appreciate all the many many blessings I have in my life. Just think of all those highs you have had and remember there will be more, hopefully. Hope is actually what you need to overcome these feelings. Always believe! When I'm reading about history (such as WW2) and learn all about Auschwitz and horrible things such as that, thats when I start to ask questions like "How can humans be capable of such evilness?". I find that quite upsetting and wonder how life actually works and the point of it. Finally as I say just try to be optimistic.

Sometimes its how siblings are treated that makes you feel this way.|`|MLSAWWbRaa	Its normal too feel this way so don't worry too much about it.Your just growing up and wanting too have your own independence.|`|e5OkARuJaa	It's really normal for us teenagers to be emotional.

nyqoPvL2aa	Read up on attachment theory. Basically it says that how secure people are comes largely from certain things their parents did or didn't do with them as kids... kinda shapes their expectations of how other people will treat them.
PvAp83TWaa	It seems like trouble is starting from your family. <br>  <br>  How are you feeling right now?<br>  <br>  This may sound too much. But I strongly urge you too see your school's guidance council, or whatever it is called in your place. (some place where you can talk about your problems or your situation)<br>  <br>  You are in a mood of pessimism called depression.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do not worry, you need not be crazy to see a psychologist or a councilor. And this is not your fault why you are like this OK? By means, your parents made you feel bad, and bored about yourself. It is written in your subconscious mind.<br>  <br>  Go talk to a psychiatrist or councilor or teacher in your school.
PwqwgQykaa	The behavioural reinforcement theory has some merit in this case.  But simply put, we are not "taught" to ignore insults, but it is a means of protecting one's self and their self-concept.  Empirical research has demonstrated that it takes about 3-4 positive comments to counterbalance a negative one, because of the perceived harm.  Praise re-affirms us, while insults prey on insecurities, and people cope with it in different way:  denial, grieving (loss of one's original perception of self), or anger.  What is taught is how to constructively use criticism to better ourselves.|`|BDHWZmfDaa	praise is generally given when you are doing something right. Because of operant conditioning we know that the more praise(reinforcment) a behaviour gets the more likely it is to reoccur, and insults(punishments) we know decrese the frequency of a behaviour occuring again.<br>  We are not so much taight to accept praise as it is an innate survival type thing, for example lets say you go to the forest and you find some berries and you eat them they taste good so that behaviour is reinforced and you are more likly to go back to the berries when hungry, lets say you then try to get some honey out of a beehive the bees sting you and that behaviour is then punished so you are less likly to go back and get hurt. Praise(reinforcement) is given when you do the right thing and the "right" thing is supposed to be the safe survival option, insults are supposed to be the wrong thing as they are negative. So consequently we end up listining to praise and ignoring insults|`|jeEEVXaLaa	Both insults and praise are important in developing character, however focusing placing too much focus on the insults can have a negative effect on your self esteem.<br>  <br>  We are taught to focus on the praises so that we know what to keep doing right and feel encouraged.|`|Xmxaxi5Gaa	it's considered more valid because that's just how it's taught.<br>  we take advantage of good things and throw away the bad things.
1AP5gVygaa	Hi there, I don't know her so I can't say she is racist, however she does appear to be insensitive to your feelings. Maybe when she is angry she tries to think of a way to hurt you and I know from experience that racial abuse can be hurtful.

Pimps are to be found in all ethnicities. Are you not negatively stereotyping yourself and if you are, why?|`|6Fa5Eam8aa	I can't see why she would be a racist, she just wants to offend you because she's angry....rather, I wonder if YOU are racist if you feel that a general word like pimp should have a "colour" connotation......|`|GTBl5IrYaa	a pimp refers to a male 'whore' so it is not related in any way to race, in my opinion|`|d2ef8cb021560ac7c67c4c024319ac86aa	being a pimp is not exclusive to any race, so no don't think she is racist , very angry maybe but not racist|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	if she was a racist she wouldn't be with you at all, she may call anyone a pimp and not to a particular race

Others seem to have it so well sometimes and we seem to have it so hard.  I have been very lucky myself and have it great now.  What did I do?  I worked really hard and studied a lot.  I continue to study and work.  Have fun with life.  You have your life now, not the other that you are looking at.  If you spend your time worried about the other lives around you too much, you will loose your own.  Enjoy your life and strive to improve.  That is really all we can do.

2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	For me, it makes me feel feminine and sorta covert--like when I'm at a regional meeting and talking with the fat cats, and I'm being all brainy and schmoozey and creating policies and yada yada yada I can think "heh, I'm wearing a garter".  It's stupid and juvenile, but I can't help it.  Then there are times when I wear it strictly for sexual reasons.

I'll do it for effect - usually when there's a man who wants it, but actually I don't enjoy it.<br>  Maybe because my first husband used to insist on it and I felt rather dirty and degraded.<br>  I wear what I want to now - my husband wants to wear what he wants, within reason, and so do I.  I don't need to prove I'm sexy - I know I am.|`|c6g92RRVaa	I don't like wearing it. I mean I think I look ok in it but it isn't comfortable to me.

People definitely noticed and it makes you feel better overall.
Tkb1TKwZaa	Wanting to change is a good first step.<br>  <br>  Just, before you get sensitive, just collect yourself and put yourself in your friends/parents/etc.'s shoes.  Why did they say what they did?  What were they intending to do by saying it?  Just keep in mind that your friends/parents care about you.  They're just looking out for you.<br>  <br>  Before you confront somebody, just think about it.  Where they just kidding around?  Could it be funny?  Would you have said the same thing if you were in their shoes?  If not, tell them you didn't think it was funny, but is a different sense of humor between friends grounds for starting conflict?  If they're telling you should do something, think about why they want you to, and appreciate that they worry about how you conduct yourself.<br>  <br>  Put yourself in their shoes, and think about the motivations, emotions, and thought process behind the words.<br>  <br>  But if after thinking it all through, and if you understand that there was actual malicious intent behind the words, don't hold yourself back from arguing.  Just don't let your sensitivity get in the way of you and the people who care for you the most.|`|VgPG5WMsaa	Try to employ humor. This is an amazing tool! You can make a point of disagreement very powerfully with humor. When someone takes a side that is ridiculous don't respond with intellectual precision and sharp words. Instead, use your imagination. Use humor to ridicule an indefensible position.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	grow some back bone!! my sister is like that. just know that family and close friends play around a lot! sometimes we go too far, but in our minds, its just a huge joke. and when us the kidders, see that you got sooo sensitive over a joke, it almost gets annoying, bc we see it as, "gosh look at him he cant even take a joke!"  and most of the time, your family is the one who is going to tell you the truth about how you look, dress, act, talk, etc. but we dont mean to be hurtful, just helpful.

Sometimes I have to wait to get it, but God has met every need in my heart from the time I was a small child until now.  Maybe you didn't get what you wanted because you didn't ask God for it, or maybe he didn't think you were ready to have it just yet.  Peace be with you.|`|ewgDtqD3aa	yep, but we have to know that there is a reason why we are not getting whatever that might be, usually the universe is protecting us or warming us from some people or something, usually we are being protecting and i believe that IF IT'S NOT COMING TO YOU THEN IT'S NOT YOURS AND NOT GOOD FOR YOU FOR GOOD REASON AND THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER IF  YOU GO BY YOUR LIFE AND LET THINGS HAPPEN ON THEIR OWN<br>  i am telling you this but sometime it's hard to let things happen on their own but we must let things happen on their own and focus on other things like school or work or if you want to do more traveling just do it and let things happen.|`|AA10717478	yes. and when that happens. u do whatever u can to get that item.

AA11647127	People are divided into three categories: the winners, the losers and the lucky ones. The winners are the ones who, in spite of being lazy sometimes, in spite of procrastinating many times, in spite of being superficial at times are stubborn enough to not let too many people be better than they are. The losers are the ones who accept being the underdog all their lives because they're not ambitious enough. The lucky ones are the ones born to rich families (or lottery winners). It's up to you to decide in which category you'll be included at the end of your life. If you want to be a winner, you can start by learning how to write properly in English. My advice is sincere.|`|2JerJwCcaa	You are doing very good. This is not a big challenge. You can study and retain with intelligence. It just needs prioritization.

RKLce4ltaa	Women, as they like to remind us, don't have to worry about a di!do going soft on them.<br>  <br>  Blow-up dolls are generally unattractive, so men usually don't bother.  When robots that look like RealDolls start running around, though, men may re-evaluate.|`|3cb1b9273ff7534ec3ef0fd97957cdacaa	The male equivalent of a woman using a dildo is a man using his hand, or perhaps a fleshlight, to stimulate himself.  <br>  <br>  Likewise, the female equivalent of a man using a female blow-up doll would be a woman using a male blow-up doll.  <br>  <br>  What you're doing is comparing apples and oranges.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, the reason why men usually don't use toys and women sometimes do is because a dildo can't get to places our fingers can't.

Not to mention the fact that many sex toys for women come with vibrating attachments and all kinds of other cool things that just get the job done in a timely manner.   You don't have to wait for the guy or finish up yourself.  <br>  <br>  I personally prefer real guys, because although they can't make anything vibrate or come in crazy colors without being diseased, they're all warm and manly and I love that.|`|NmQCYizTaa	Because vibrators are better, sexually speaking, for a woman quite often than even a man is. Technically, intercourse was never meant to get a woman off. It helps, but its not necessary. For reproduction, only the man needs to come. <br>  <br>  However, vibes have been purpose built to stimulate a woman, esp the clitoris and external genitalia, rather thn jst the vagina, which has few nerve endings. Therefore, they can, sexually, replace a man.<br>  <br>  Emotionally, though, theyre a bit useless ;)|`|CRDl9nffaa	Ha!<br>  <br>  Because dolls get in the way of the monitor?<br>  <br>  Realistic answer: because you don't need to. Your hot spots are easy to get at.<br>  <br>  Thoughtful answer: because guys are really hung up about masturbation. They're terrified of admitting they do it unless they can make it into a big joke. <br>  <br>  If they weren't so embarrassed they might be able to get over themselves and use toys. Good luck to the ones who have lost their hang ups!<br>  <br>  Of course a lot of women still have hang ups too, but it's easier for us now to be straightforward about this and not feel awkward.|`|xsyAljhaaa	That's just an example of the blatant, sexist objectification of men.

PvAp83TWaa	Well, dreams are your minds way of converting covert and overt subconscious thoughts into review.<br>  <br>  Almost every dream has a meaning.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the content, and the feelings involved.<br>  <br>  For example, I dreamt that I was looking in the mirror only to find that my hair changed. And in my dream I loved my new hair!<br>  <br>  Checking on the site that I'll refer as my source, my interpretation to it was that I am in the phase of observing how much I have put efforts in my life to change. And the changes that I have made in my life has made me really successful.<br>  <br>  The mirror denoted the self-check. The new hair denoted 'change in onself'... The feeling of hapinness when I checked my hair denoted that I was happy with the changes in my life ;)<br>  <br>  Each dream has a personal and subconscious meaning..<br>  <br>  Most are very subtle.. And most dreams have to be decoded..<br>  <br>  With practice, you'll be able to decode almost every dream you have..<br>  <br>  You can also use these dreams to identify what really is bothering you right now..

Did you someone you care about die? did you loose your house to natural causes?

Think of your new relationship with your bf like you just one the lottery. Not only do you have a lot of money now, but you have the fear that you're going to loose it. The dream is just an expression of this anxiety.|`|bfNDLbVqaa	It's just your fears showing in the dream, it's rarely a vision of the future.<br>  <br>  Are you scared that he's going to leave you?
FFU1DqCWaa	everyone has some symptoms sometimes no worries!<br>  trust me i have some OCD symptoms too and i was freaking out about it too for awhile but you don't have it also your mind may just be making you feel like it. same with when someone is sick you just all of a sudden feel like your sick to its no big deal just don't stress about it!|`|LKgC9VQdaa	You either have some form of attention defect disorder and feel a need to have a mental disorder. or your just another hypochondriac|`|4zscfvvoaa	look up hypochondriac.

BAaf9NKdaa	When we are born, we as infants, have no knowledge of sickness<br>   or death or constructed sentences. We experience things and<br>   from those experiences we call out to the type of experience we<br>   are having. If it is hunger pains we cry...if it is an object that amuses<br>   we grin or giggle. If it is a messy diaper some will cry out. As we <br>   experience these things we come to know that they happen. How<br>   you are nurtured about these experiences will be the way you re-act.<br>     Children that are very young and lose a parent in death do not know<br>   death but knows that the parent is no longer there. If it is  one of<br>   the parents that was dominant on waiting and spending time with<br>   the child, the child will miss the individual being there at particular<br>   times. Like when the child is sleepy and restless, hungry and seeking<br>   attention. Depending on the age of the child other experiences in it's<br>   life will dominate the memory of the child and time as we say heals<br>   the memory. The heart of the child clings to the parent until the<br>   memory eases the parent from her thought process. The older we get<br>   the harder it is to not constantly think of ones mate or child that was <br>   lost. So the answer to your question is that we learn about death<br>   and have come to think of it as a natural occurrence that can be and <br>   will end. Children in their early years by their home enviroment, t.v.<br>   programs and video games learn about death and the cause. The <br>   biggest fear is that they by seeing violence on the t.v., youtube, <br>   video games, the evening news and newspaper they have seen so<br>   much killing, blowing up, stealing to get money, drugs and gangs<br>   that they feel this to be a natural thing to occur. They deep down <br>   have calloused their hearts in that if it does not take place near or<br>   happen to them or someone close to them they do not particularly<br>   care nor do they wish to hear about it. They live in a world of low <br>   morals and self-esteem. Dropping out of school to roam the streets<br>   and get into trouble. <br>     That is why we must teach our children at an early age to have<br>   respect for life and to be careful that we do not do something that<br>   would take the life of someone directly or indirectly as we grow up.<br>   Everyone that has a capable mind knows right and wrong once they <br>   grow up. It is almost like a sixth sense we have. <br>      As far as dying I can tell you this; the spirit of life within a person<br>   fights to remain alive within that person. The body was created to be<br>   able to live forever if the diseases and sicknesses were done away <br>   with that we face daily. The body would continue to live if people<br>   would not kill the body by shooting or blowing up or running over<br>   any individual. Only because of these things and mainly sickness<br>   and disease does the body grow weak to where it can no longer sustain life in it. What I am saying is that when Almighty God <br>   created man he did not mean for man to die. The body could continue <br>   on and on under the right conditions. Adam for example; it took<br>   Adam, once he sinned, 930 years to die. The body resist death.<br>   When one is drowning he thrashes about and gasp for air. This is <br>   built in resistance to death fighting back. When a person is being<br>   smothered or strangled the body fights back in it's convulsive ways<br>   to stop what is happening. It is like instinct that it happens. The <br>   way we were created proves that we were not created to grow old <br>   and die, as the body resist death. Only to the point to much damage was done or the body has grown weak and feeble and has not the strenght to fight off disease and infections and the God given strenght<br>   to resist. So we have learned alot about  death today. Read your<br>   Bible at Isaiah 26; 19 and you will learn more about the future of the <br>   dead. also Rev. 20;|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	Learned. Think lemmings.|`|TfLZjPm2aa	Id say its learned. Maybe not from death itself, but we might generalize. We see that everything else in this world has a beginning and an end, so what makes life any different? So even if a child has not experienced someone dying or has never been told of death, it is very plausible that the child learned of death from generalization.|`|MLSAWWbRaa	We learn about it.

cN8jCoBUaa	Everyone goes through the same feeling. What that feeling is is a sense of failure but at the same time a motivation to achieve . Maybe what you can do instead of avoiding it is try doing it a little at a time and see where you go. So start at the bottom, of the stairs, take it one step at a time. and see how high you go. <br>  <br>  This would probably be my best suggestion.<br>  <br>  Seems like everyone else who posted above me is saying the same thing, and if you have any more questions, feel free to ask again, and I will try to help .<br>  <br>  Hi Mavu, sorry about the late response. For long-term goals, it primarily follows the same approach. You take it one step at a time which will of course also requires patience, and strength and commitment and hardwork and staying positive. For me, I find the best way when aiming for long term goals is to break the bigger problem down instead smaller parts, and then tackle each at a time. Slowly, I get there. <br>  <br>  Like you said, it does indeed require a certain degree of strength to acheive such goals, and you may realize this or not, that is what makes striving for the goal more worthwhile.<br>  <br>  Oh yea, another thing you should keep in mind. <br>  Expect that you will fail during the first few hurdles. By expecting it, you will not feel too bad and feel like you want to give up when that happens. Afterwords, everything usually comes smoothly if you keep up this optimism and hardwork.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Never force yourself to do anything, you'll only resent it.

e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	In the end, it's just a feel-good commercial exercise to give an illusion of awareness and action. As far as most women in the west are concerned, it's just a day when women can have fun belittling men and making them slave for them.<br>  <br>  Most women in the world don't care about women's day. It's only the high and mighty princesses who act as if theit husbands are obliged to do all the work that day. The other women (read 'third world countries') keep working and don't care about women's day. The high and mighty princesses don't care about oppressed women on Women's day, it's just an excuse to have some fun.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, it isn't just 'celebrating the female'.

p28hM9ZGaa	Wierd what little phobias we develop, the good news is you arent alone, millions of people have odd phobias and aversions. I won't tell you mine as it sounds loopy. I would write down your problem on a little slip of paper and your symptoms and hand it to the Dr at the beginning of the appointment. That way he wont go into too much detail, it will go on your notes which is helpful if he refers you and also he can help treat your phobias as well as the other problems. Good luck.|`|BDHWZmfDaa	My advice would be to go to a psychologist preferably one who is a cognitive behaviourist, thwy have the best treatments for geting over your phobias.

FnRGYJn5aa	I had similar dreams for a while, years ago. About someone dear to me dying... That person is still alive and very much OK and happy, so I guess you have nothing to worry about:) ..some superstitious predictions also claim that if you dream someone's gonna die, then that someone will have good luck in the future. So yay!<br>  <br>  I think you dreaming of your little sister dying just comes out of unconscious fear of protecting her. Don't be afraid for her safety so much and the pressure will go away.|`|P2eCpu5gaa	YOUR SISTER WILL DIE!!!!!!<br>  just joking, dreams are nothing more than imagination- they mean absolutely nothing. Your mind is still awake but you are sleeping.<br>  I even have dreams of killing my entire family in the middle of the night with a chain-saw, I REALLY DO! but do I do it ???<br>  Don't worry, It is normal to have weird dreams - Even two nights in a row :)|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Dreams are no way to predict the future, but they **can** be (said cautiously) a great way to figure out what things are weighing on your own mind.  This sounds like you are fearing the loss of your sister, big-time.<br>  <br>  Is there some big change that is happening in your life (like, you are going away to college, or to the military, etc), or in the life of your family (your sister's going away to boarding school, or your family is moving house, or your parents are thinking about divorcing)?  Anticipating the down-side of big changes can prompt nightmares like this.<br>  <br>  Little changes can also do this, though not as commonly. (Did you and your sister have a fight recently?  Do you have continuing friction with her over something lately?) <br>  <br>  You need to consciously look at why this scenario might be playing out in your unconscious mind like this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  And in the meantime, give your sister a big hug and a funny friendship card.|`|awLr3uCaaa	I have had various dreams of people dying; my mom, sister, dad. It's all ways of your subconscious working things out in our brain. In my case, I think mine had a lot to do with abandonment. Our family was going through some tough times and things got really shaky for a while. If you're having issues like that, they may be to cause. If not, your brain's just getting a little extra excercise at night. No need to worry in either case. It's completely normal. No need to worry about superstitious bull **** like it meaning someone is about to die.|`|rcEq136naa	Like you said, whenever I have wierd dreams like that it normally means the opposite. You probably dreamed it again the next night because you were worrying about it all day. It's nothing to worry about. Good luck.|`|PvAp83TWaa	Well, dreams are your minds way of converting covert and overt subconscious thoughts into review.<br>  <br>  Almost every dream has a meaning.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the content, and the feelings involved.<br>  <br>  For example, I dreamt that I was looking in the mirror only to find that my hair changed. And in my dream I loved my new hair!<br>  <br>  Checking on the site that I'll refer as my source, my interpretation to it was that I am in the phase of observing how much I have put efforts in my life to change. And the changes that I have made in my life has made me really successful.<br>  <br>  The mirror denoted the self-check. The new hair denoted 'change in onself'... The feeling of hapinness when I checked my hair denoted that I was happy with the changes in my life ;)<br>  <br>  Each dream has a personal and subconscious meaning..<br>  <br>  Most are very subtle.. And most dreams have to be decoded..<br>  <br>  With practice, you'll be able to decode almost every dream you have..<br>  <br>  You can also use these dreams to identify what really is bothering you right now.. Or what problems you are facing.. ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway about your dream, don't worry! Dreams CANNOT tell the future. This have not been proven, and those who claim that it does, just got lucky! People love to believe that there is still some unkown or external forces in this world.<br>  <br>  So about your dream,  A dead person whom you knew (or knew of) in real life can represent that person, or your memory of that person.<br>  <br>  Seeing such a person in a dream can mean they are particularly on your mind right now, perhaps because you've been thinking about them or would like to interact with them, because a significant date (birthday, anniversary, etc.) is near, because you're curious about how they are or what they might think about something in your life right now, etc.<br>  <br>  Now this may not be the right one.. Consider your feelings and the details in the dream.. Refer to the site below ;)
RBUGeZ2Naa	addictive|`|AA11071860	It's another example of the desensitizing we all undergo because of the media. For example, we read about a tragedy in the media. We feel sorry for the victim and think we could somehow relate to the victim's pain, nevertheless we are in reality detached from the victim, since we have no personal connection outside of both of us being human beings. Facebook, UTube, YahooA is also a part of this desensitizing, yet different than the traditional media because those sites are interactive. Facebooks with a following by close friends is a different ballgame because close friends are made through personal contact, and Facebook just enhances the relationship. Nevertheless, it also desensitizing, a lot more subtlety, because having personal contact with friends, for example go to a party, we could use all of our senses to interact while on Facebook, we only uses one sense, visual, and rely mostly on emotions to react.|`|0I1PC8ZDaa	I think socializing sites are great because it gives people the chance to make new friends, find old friends and have fun.<br>  I regularly use facebook, bebo, myspace and msn.<br>  I think its great because its alot of fun and you always have something to do.|`|FIM8h9gKaa	social sites have both positive and negative points, but it mostly depends on the person who uses them. for example, if a person wants to use a social site to get closer to friends, or to make MORE friends, they will probably be fine. they will most likely have a good time on their site of choice, and maybe even become better at talking to people. the main issue arises when people sign on to social sites to make ANY friends. in these cases, many people can become isolated from the real world and become more cut off then they already were. but this isn't the fault of the sites, but of society.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped :)|`|OgEFtyb3aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Well I have both bebo and facebook, and I LOVE them.

RsjPhDoMaa	I have just copied and pasted this from wikipedia. "Social policy relates to guidelines for the changing, maintenance or creation of living conditions that are conducive to human welfare. Thus social policy is that part of public policy that has to do with social issues. Social policy aims to improve human welfare and to meet human needs for education, health, housing and social security."
PtoieF7Caa	Sadly you are right. Either you know someone who can introduce you into a decent job and vouch for you. Or you start at the very bottom and work your way up with the most grueling and soul-destroying work. The type that anyone with even half a brain could do.<br>  Unless you get lucky with your potential employer you can pretty much wave your qualifications out the window. They're really not going to help you that much, the only thing they prove is your dedication to a subject.<br>  If you want a chance with an employer then give them something to notice. <br>  Be honest. Ask them questions about their company and how it was started, seem interested in the background of your new business.<br>  Drop the occasional joke or two to make them laugh but don't over-do it, you're trying to prove that you're mature and liable enough for a position of responsibility.<br>  If you can strike a chord with your new employer and make them laugh, make them see you as more than their newest pay monkey then you have a chance. You have to stand out above the rest of the applicants if you want to get into a good job with limited experience and no previous company connections.|`|28667a2fab4e406f52bfe94a34c859cbaa	i have always hated that ..everyone needs to start someone|`|f3e5e4d7af5d1a05594696425078e04faa	via osmosis

There is usually something going on with someone else or an ex or whatever. If there is, and I find out about it, I will usually let them choose whatever they think is right for them. If someone you have feelings for likes someone better, that is there choice and it's not right if you have to convince them to be with you; you will just come off desperate. If it doesn't feel 100% right with someone, don't waste your time!|`|aDhZIhQcaa	For one thing, it is morally wrong to mess with someone else's heart, emotions, and mind.

t9rOvMVuaa	No. In fact you are tired of her way of controlling you but your education maybe prevents you from telling her to calm down, to leave you alone and that you are a free human being with also a life that belongs to you. That you don`t want her to embarrass you in front of other friends. You don`t want her spinning around all the time and u feel her like a fly constantly messing beeezzzz! beeezzzz! with your ear while you want to sleep and all along day. As  you don`t want to express it freely u dream about it.<br>  I give you an advice. Start puting her the limits now cause later it will be a serious problem.
TXyFtQ9uaa	People need to communicate with one another they need to relate to one another and in some cases confide with one another, this is a basic definition of a platonic relationship ie. to have friends or associates. Taking this to a much more intimate level where a couple wish to share their spiritual and physical all with one another this is the definition of a loving relationship. All human beings need at least one aspect of relationships in their lives otherwise they will become lonely and emotionally depressed which can eventually lead to psychological problems for the individual concerned. After all It is human nature and how we are designed by the creator.|`|XHmz4R99aa	Yeah, it's called "loneliness."<br>  Humans are social creatures, we need love, and social contact.<br>  <br>  See a counselor, not sure what you mean by incapable of love.

KfBQOgQLaa	Being a good righteous person. Doing good works for our Heavenly Father and helping others any way you can. Reading the scriptures, fending off sin, taking advantage of our ability to repent.<br>  <br>  But the whole successful thing about this, is doing ALL of those things WHILE living your life in a community where everyones lifestyles are all on their own. Where looking good and being really smart or having this much money or these kind of friends is all anyone talks about. <br>  <br>  I think successful is being able to live without pleasing man, and living to please Heavenly Father and following your own righteous desires, abiding by the ten commandments and making good decisions. <br>  <br>  We are told to "live unto this world, but not of this world." Being able to do that, live in this place but not become the norm inside of it is the real challenge. And if you can do that, you're a successful and honorable person in my book!|`|WTBvi6ySaa	Good question. Good grades (which sadly i cant get), a degree, a family. money, a nice home, nice car. All that fancy stuff but not too much of it.|`|W6wamWLLaa	Getting good, grades, getting a god career and lots of money!!!<br>  That is how i measure success anyway.|`|MeGehliuaa	Inner peace, that's what humans struggle to acheive.|`|gJYo9Uotaa	Being truly successful is determined by what goals you set and if you achieve them. If you set your own personal goals and accomplish them by your own means, you are successful. There is no universal rule to being successful. Having extensive wealth or possessions, a good job and/or marriage isn't really successful unless you persevered to make it happen.|`|AA10835554	Most people make the mistake of measuring success by fame, money, family or health, but true success is finding peace, meaning no mental pain. This is all that really matters, and ultimately what they are trying to find through those things, but never do. As soon as they get what they wanted, something else comes up that makes them unhappy. Take the incident with Chris Brown and Rhianna for example. <br>  <br>  One would think that mental pain is normal, and it is, but that doesn't mean has to be that way. Peace comes from the inner self, not thoughts, or things, but knowing that you are the awareness behind those things, and shifting your identity from form to the formless awareness that you are. Its not religion, but a knowing that takes the place of a reaction.|`|LCZ9f9bSaa	First: You should trust your fighting spirit! Always think You can do it! for short think positive.. <br>  Second: If you want to be successful, you can read some books of author such as David King.

Then after it you can know how much you will save each month to be deposit to your bank savings.. then the rest i believe you know what to do.. Oh! one thing in the way of success, you should learn how to be humble and learn from your mistakes.. correct your mistakes and plan for your long term and short goal...|`|GTBl5IrYaa	understanding who you are, resisting temptation, concentrating on the important things in life and having a stable home and work life|`|XppFZhChaa	successful? <br>  knowing a truth, i mean a question.|`|suRwV490aa	happynesss general|`|5EA4XKpZaa	stability in all areas of life|`|A78bcDn9aa	i consitewr some one above and beond there goal|`|aJGAXYUIaa	to go out and get a job and or do your part every day etc|`|KZNVb7ehaa	getting at least a bachelors degree and a job.

WxYCI40oaa	to not get screwd up when she will ask me for divorce..|`|AA10019693	Women overall initiate 67% of divorces in America.  Among college-educated women, some studies indicate that figure is 90%.<br>  <br>  Women still gain primary custody of children the vast majority of the time in divorce, and child support is calculated based on a payer's GROSS income and is tax-free to the recipient.  If you get the kids, you get the house, and a monthly tax-free stipend.<br>  <br>  Women can get child support even if the children of the marriage are fathered by another man outside fo the marriage.  Women who molest boys are also potentially able to receive child support, and frequently receive custody of those children, even though they may be categorized as sex offenders.<br>  <br>  Long term duration marriages in states like California give the right of the non-working spouse to lifetime alimony.  Alimony is rarely granted to men, however.<br>  <br>  Men aren't getting married because the risks and punishment of divorce far outweigh the benefits of marriage.|`|8s3rMWojaa	Because if i marry her she might dump me and take all my money.

gJYo9Uotaa	I can relate to this all too well. This has happened to me before and I came to the conclusion that it's your mind's default way of desperately trying to bury memories of the things that cause you pain. To achieve this, you categorize things according to your feelings, thus leaving you with a distaste for certain items.<br>  <br>  This isn't exclusively your problem, it is pretty widely acknowledged as far as I know. It really isn't anything serious although it does help to try and make amends with yourself as to what decisions you did or did not make.|`|coqTBB6baa	I have done that before...<br>  I think most of us have.

We assumed the men had to pee inside the women to get them pregnant. We were grossed out and said WE wouldn't ever have sex.|`|W0AK2Lumaa	I was shocked and wanted to be like the girls in the videos....<br>  I was 11|`|fofzdoROaa	I first thought it was dirty and crude.|`|wCRC0poAaa	yes, i remember when i was about 10 my mum gave me a sex education book for girls called GIRLS TALK. i was reading it in bed one night and when i got to the bit that described intercourse i got a fright and dropped the book from the top bunk i was sleeping in. <br>  <br>  when i was about 12 my best friend phoned me to come see her because she was upset after finding her dads porno mags. when she showed me them i felt a bit sick in my stomach and felt wierd being around her dad after that.<br>  <br>  when i was 15 my boyfriend and i were in his cousins house and the cousin put on a porno movie. i felt a bit sick over a scene involving a vibrator but i pretended not to be, and carried on eating my apple. lol!!|`|6d37069c5dadd18ae165702d8afb480faa	My cousin and I used to climb into the cabinet under her bathroom sink with a flashlight and look at my uncle's magazines.   My aunt caught us once and told us if we had any questions that it was OK to ask her.  We did.  She explained everything we asked about.  We were repulsed, yet fascinated. I think I was probably 6 or 7.  It blows my mind that anyone could get to their teen years and not ever have learned about sex...|`|kDz9gcMuaa	I was 11 and the year had to watch sex education everyone laughed I think cause it looked weird|`|yA8ENEW6aa	i had this misconception that all sex was anal sex, and that sounded really uncomfortable.|`|T3A7haiJaa	Yeah. My reaction? A *****|`|sfn6SpbCaa	No not really. When we were kids the neighbor kids and we would sit around telling those famous "Flashlight and Cave" stories. <br>  Around school you'd hear about a certain girl who would let the boys see her panties.<br>  In the sixth grade we had those films about menstruation and in senior year we had sex education, of course, our mommies and daddies had to sign that special paper.<br>  And living next to a farm there was plenty of action going on.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No I was too young to remember<br>  <br>  Harriet
JJCSEe3Taa	I have a similar thing however it's more ways of how to embarrass myself. Like in class I think of myself just stripping naked and running around. Kissing random people in the street or even my friends when they are tlaking to me. No idea why I get those but I try to remove them from my head as fast as possible.|`|yuiXfQqbaa	i feel like this so much...especially when i'm nervous. don't worry. it just happens...u don't really do it.|`|j0aeAUs9aa	This sounds crazy but i used to have that problem and it was because of something called Dave.  Dave was  ghost and he haunted me for 2 years and for 2 years i imagined killing my pets, hitting my mum and even killing myself.  <br>  <br>  About 2 years later i decided to se a medium and she told me what Dave was doing.  She got rid of him and now i dont imagine them anymore.  That might not be your problem though.<br>  <br>  Hope i could help|`|B0CEeN8laa	You should do more fun things outside. Maybe your just stressed out a lot and need to enjoy yourself more. Do something with your friends. I don't think anything is wrong per say. Just try to relax more and work a little less :)|`|IIH6JjDVaa	I have the same prob, so i just try to think about something else, like a yummy food we will eat later or something.
gnWodF2jaa	I feel your pain! The kids are just stupid. If they went to another country and had to learn a whole new language from scratch they would be laughed at. What you should try to do is practice your German before going up there to present. It always helps to practice. When presenting don't look at the students. They'd probably be snickering and you'd feel pretty bad. Just stare at the wall or something. Speak loudly for good oral marks. Once your finished just sit down and pray that you will never have to do something like that anytime later on. Good luck :P
e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	Yes. My account got suspended for 2 chatting violations. That was outrageous, and I won the suspension appeal.<br>  <br>  I've also won numerous cases where my questions or answers were wrongly reported. I think the key is to keep your language formal (try not to insult Y!A no matter how angry you feel), and cite all guidelines applicable to your post and prove that you violate none of them.|`|houWY7qvaa	Yes.  They do check it out.  And I admit to being wrong-once.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Nope.  Even when one of my answers was just "yeah."  I got reported, I appealed and they told me that "my answer indeed in violation of blah, blah, blah."  They're a$$holes.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Several times.<br>  <br>  The biggest issue is they don't give full details - so you have to really pick at the information to understand what miniscule reason they use as an excuse for deleting your Q/A.<br>  <br>  One on occasion, I was very rude to them - calling them a few choice words - and I still won. Class!<br>  <br>  <br>  I think it all depends on who your appeal goes to - some days it's a nice guy, other days it's a crabby, PMT-ridden pain the bum.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	yes, I have won three to date, but I have lost more than that.  I think the other poster is right about how it really depends on who your appeal goes to.  Generally I get reported for sarcasm (who'd a thunk it?!?!?), and those are the ones that I never win.  I would award the appeal......hey, how do you get to be on the committee or whatever that makes these decisions?  We should have a mole!  Let's get a nomination list going! lol|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Nah I never bother to appeal - do have a friend who did so and got his account reinstated though after a suspension<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Never.<br>  <br>  I don't think they really listen or care.|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	Yep. <br>  <br>  Mostly for answers that have been reported, like answering "no" to something and having to justify it. I do a lot of answers in military, and sometimes the only real answer is it depends. I always go into detail on what it depends on, but sometimes it still gets reported and deleted, but everyone of those has been re-instated.|`|Y3OeeB66aa	i believe that i have once but the amount of time and effort to do it dose not seam worth it and most of the time they do not actually read it it is an automatic response there is no care or checking involved i don't bother any more|`|NNHdkLDWaa	nah its easier to make a new account. takes 3 min. Why should I care about the points ? Can you trade them in or something ?|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I have won a few times. I have lost more than I won.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	No they don't care. It's a free service, they aren't bothered what happens to peopels accounts.|`|bGsXsDhBaa	yes<br>  <br>  a few times recently: questions ansd answers were reinstated|`|STumBiU0aa	no!  they ignore most appeals etc.|`|AXNowGPyaa	No. I don't think I ever even have received an actual communication  from a live person. I've never really pursued in very far, because I have a life and think YA is a big enough squandering of my time as it is. But I have had a few completely bogus violations that I was able to get nowhere on in appeal.|`|41Dwgx0Caa	Yes.  It's all to do with the technicalities and there is so much of a grey area that it's not hard to get a question/answer reinstated but then it depends on who you get to review the decision.<br>  Had a question deleted months ago and it was reinstated along with an apology, which was nice.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	Yes. For example a few hours ago I answered a question from Edit Clarke, and my answer got reported. There was no good reason for my answer to be reported so I appealed the decision and my answer got reposted.|`|EJ1ZmHVaaa	I did and won.  someone marked my answer as abusive when it wasn't. respond to the email they sent you and explain yourself. if you are not in the wrong they will send you another email in a day or two and give you back your points.|`|XwXuJIF8aa	Yes and when they check my reason usually the points were returned. I never violated a TOS and some people do not like the answer and will post a negative on you. But if you are in your rights fight it.|`|wSqOwWlVaa	Yes, most of them.  I got 6 questions reinstated in a day once, that was so satsfying.  Always appeal - it doesn't always work, but it's good when it does  :-)|`|5Wt7s9Draa	I didn't bother; I assumed they would not even read the appeal but just auto-answer with a "Sorry, but on further review... it was decided that..."|`|NmQCYizTaa	Nope. I tried to appeal and got suspended. Heh. Theyre pretty damn conservative people from what I can tell, theyll happily sidle with the bigots who complain against liberal thinking|`|uhchod38aa	Won one appeal.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	Many a time.
AA10835554	I wouldn't say the brain is more prone to negativity but the human condition is. People get their identity from complaining. They say, "I am right and they are wrong", or "that is ugly" and this gives them a strong sense of self. If that is ugly, they must be the opposite.<br>  <br>  There is also allot of negative energy built up in people as they grow older, and so that energy almost seems to take on a life of its own, and then craves more pain. Its quite insane, but is overlooked because its so normal. You can notice the majority of our movies are designed to feed this pain. The only way to awaken from this cycle of madness is to become aware of it. Just noticing this will actually diffuse the need for more pain. <br>  <br>  One common statement they will make is, "I'm just being realistic". But how is being negative more realistic than being positive? They are confusing preparation with negativity. It is good to be prepared for the worst, but don't try to feed your anger etc with the process. <br>  <br>  Also you really can't teach this to a negative person, as they will just get mad and defend themselves. Its truly something you must learn on your own.|`|8YGZ5xNFaa	I think so but only because we want to tell ourselves we can't do it so we can actually prove to ourselves what we can do.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I think the heart has something to do with that. The heart determines if a person is more prone to being negative and/or positive.|`|85gJHDbNaa	I think it's just a matter of your environment. If when you were little, or in general, you were exposed to negative reinforcement (yelling about bad things you may have one, angry words, and generally negative parents) you may have a hard time seeing the positive since it was never pointed out. This is why most psychiatrists recommend positive reinforcement and praise for children rather than punishment. An easy way to reverse personal negativity is to take a few deep breaths when you're angry, and think of something positive that has happened. Most people are just satisfied being negative though, so it would be hard to fix the mass jerk-off pandemic in the world....
xEmIhOc3aa	there are no specific types ..the brain gathers all thoughts and activites that were done through out tht day and compact them all into a dream , a good person can have nightmares , it really depends on <br>  what they were doing that day and there mood ...i think our subconscious minds pick up on the way we feel during the days and reflect them in our dreams ...<br>  <br>  EX; i was thinking a/b meeting this guy offthe internet who i was feeling a little uneasy about,  i had a dream and later figured it out...it was like i was on a roller coaster going really fast ..i was in the sky lol<br>  but anyway i figured it out and basically it meant i was going to fast and i was i found out he was a pervert ....i read sum of the books a/b online predators and tactics they use to reel kids in ..he used almost all of them. my mind was telling my sumthimg.... <br>  <br>  i think dreams are really interesting :) i went to this site ..here you can decipher your dreams too <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mydreamvisions.com/dreamdictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydreamvisions.com/dreamdicti...</a>|`|NigoVXX1aa	A beautiful world with wonderful people.|`|xjHW0boMaa	good people have a sound sleep, hence they do not remember what they saw in a dream.|`|MTfpCXUpaa	that is up to his thoughts|`|nP2vIpWBaa	same as a bad person. dreams are just a random activation of neurons during rem sleep that cause images to be interpreted by the cortex, the cortex attempts to give these dream meaning n a story form to avoid confusion. dreams are often whacky as we need to be able to dstinguish between them and real life otherwise it could be dangerous.

N9VWMIFxaa	The economy needs to be destroyed to recover!<br>  <br>  The reason is because of the 2012 shift and what the Mayan Calendar is trying to teach us.  We are moving from a fear based world to a love based world.  We are moving from darkness to the golden age.<br>  <br>  Our economy was driven by the motivating factor of fear and because of that it has to get destroyed.  There is going to be a massive change in the world and the amount of change over the next ten years is going to be similar to the amount of change over the last few hundreds or thousands of years. <br>  <br>  This shift in consciousness is moving from fear to love and we will rebuild this to the energy of love rather than that of fear.  This will take time and can not be done until after 2012.  <br>  <br>  I have more information about this shift on my webpage<br>  <br>  Peace and Light everyone :)|`|fofzdoROaa	The relatively small sums that are still available for investment will not all be loaned to the government (for Treasury Bonds at low interest rates). Some of this money will be invested in a real estate, which is now down in value, after the bubble has burst. This effectively starts a new "business-cycle" of increasing prices and it is aided by the raised national investment in infrastructure, which makes the land more useful and valuable to own. Thus speculation in land values is still alive and well and actively searching for the next bubble to grow. <br>  <br>  As this bubble grows, more people will be employed in the building trade and the money that timid investors have recently withdrawn from share-holding, will slowly find its way back into the banks via the rising real-estate prices once more. Thus it is by greed that the system will begin to recover. <br>  <br>  If the government wanted it and the politicians were aware of how land-speculation slows down progress, there would be introduced laws to provide greater opportunities for access to the land, which even now is being held but not used. Then the land prices would drop (due to a greater supply) and the land-monopolists would not be able to control who does what where. The present amount of employment would increase and the costs of production of goods would be less due to the reduced rent for land occupancy. This would lead to greater prosperity than what is presently being legislated into being today.|`|711cf445165d6c90d8f0944882e7e366aa	Do you think the markets are in the shape they are in because we don't have the right kind of health care and social security? Please. The economy will recover when and only when investors see good prospects for returns on their investments. Right now they don't. Prices have to either fall further or the government has to stop creating so much economic uncertainty -- or in the case of the pledge to raise taxes on the successful,  so much certainty.

But they aren't really feminists.

(you wouldnt believe it, i could hardly talk it was so dry) and my mouth drying up liek that has never happened to that extent before. so, yeah...<br>  im not going to say 'jsut ignore everyone' or something which everyone says, becuase i understand that its much harder than that.<br>  i dont realy know how to fix it, but im going to try hynosis, around me its quite expencive, and it doesnt work on anyone. but i hate my nerves and lack of confidence when i preforming so much that i dont really care, i may as well give it a go. have a look at them near you, and try it. jsut explain to them your situation. :) good luck.
DhZ67kgoaa	Go see a good psychotherapist.  It will take a few years to unravel the sad feelings that you have so that you can know that these feelings are telling you what your old unconscious beliefs are about yourself.

Some people are just immature and don't know any better. I'm personally waiting until I'm married to have sex. I function just fine. I know girls at school who talk about sex 24/7 because they just want attention. So people who ask how do you function without having sex, are probably just trying to get attention and rub it in your face that they have sex. Don't waste your time with them.|`|NmQCYizTaa	Its one of those things, Im sure youve noticed yourself - if you have sex everyday, you miss it if you dont for even a day, but once youve not had sex in a while (I had a 2yr break too!) it becomes easier, and you dont concentrate on it as much as other areas of life.<br>  <br>  I mean, think about celibate people - priests, nuns, monks!

I have gone through major fluctuations during the course of my life where I would go from one extreme to the next.  It's none of anyone's business, frankly, how often or with whom you have sex.  I was very sexually active until some personal things happened many years ago and then I simply didn't have any desire for sex for about 8 months or so, literally none.<br>  <br>  More recently I was in an accident where I sustained some damage to my cervical spine with a bit of sensory loss to my upper extremities.  It really isn't noticeable and doesn't keep me from doing any ordinary activities, but ever since that accident, I've felt really awkward about certain things.  It's kinda tough to explain, but I just want to wait until I'm back to my usual state before I go back into the dating scene.  Again, I haven't been with a girl in months and I'm doing okay.

PvAp83TWaa	Well, dreams are your minds way of converting covert and overt subconscious thoughts into review.<br>  <br>  Almost every dream has a meaning.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the content, and the feelings involved.<br>  <br>  For example, I dreamt that I was looking in the mirror only to find that my hair changed. And in my dream I loved my new hair!<br>  <br>  Checking on the site that I'll refer as my source, my interpretation to it was that I am in the phase of observing how much I have put efforts in my life to change.

And in my dream I loved my new hair!<br>  <br>  Checking on the site that I'll refer as my source, my interpretation to it was that I am in the phase of observing how much I have put efforts in my life to change. And the changes that I have made in my life has made me really successful.<br>  <br>  The mirror denoted the self-check. The new hair denoted 'change in onself'...

6aMeHzryaa	Try this.  When you meet someone look at them as holding some important message for your soul and let your conversations be seasoned in such a way as to draw them into sharing it with you.  Everyone in life has a view on truth that no one else has, and if we are spiritually awake we will learn to look for these views in order to expand our own.  If we do not we are selfish in nature and we will spiritually decay.  The fact is to some degree, people who appear to be outgoing sometimes are not as outgoing as they would seem.  Often it is a cover up for not wanting to deal with where they need help from you.  So don't be afraid to show that you care.  Being outgoing is not something you can gain from reading a book.  It comes from being spiritually awake and responding from the heart.  The answer you are looking for is inside you.  All you have to do is be still and listen to your own inner voice, it itself was given to you by our Father in heaven.|`|85gJHDbNaa	I had a really hard time talking to people and feeling comfortable in social situations, so my boyfriend gave me this book he had called How to Make Friends and Influence People.

Einstein. Intuition tells you what to say and when and why not to say it or where to get information. Also good to know is Emotional Intelligence and basics of Cognitive Therapy. <br>  And something else. I don't quite know how to say it to really be understood and cause an aha moment, but at our core we might say the we is just an awareness of we, the cells, a community of cells. They have a rudimentary mind of their own. We are the we that's the decider, unless we let the other decider decide for us, 'authority'. So we are just about nothing, and it's OK. The cells don't need you to do anything socially. It's just a good skill to have, so getting facts for the whole brain to use to give you informed input from it's incredible power of vision logic and speed. It's a million times faster.

6IXrgxqSaa	turgut, the reason behind the economic crisis is caused by the improper connection between people.  Man's selfish egoism. Each of us  only caring for the sake of our own well-being so much that everyone else can burn as long as we receive self benefit. Humanity's egoism has grown and grown and has now has reached a state of mutual dependence. It is becoming more and more realized each day that humanity is interconnected and dependent of one another. The world has become a global integral world. One global family. Global meaning reciprocal, complete connection between everyone. Like the butterfly effect. Someone does something in one place on earth and from this I receive something good or a blow because of this.<br>  <br>  In any body or unit to operate successfully it has to follow the law of altruism. Where all parts of that unit operate for the good of the whole and not for themselves. This law of Nature is expressed in all levels of nature except in the way man relates to one another. In other words humanity has grown to become one whole body. People are like the cells and organs while humanity represents the whole body. Our physical body functions in a way that all of the systems must function in harmony...reciprocally to keep it healthy. Each private system of our physical bodies care for the well being of the body and not for it self. Without this the whole body falls into illness or dies. Imagine if internally your body operated the way man operates in all of society. Sounds like cancer.  Whats important to understand is unless humanity will not function like a whole body we will suffer. When everyone will function for the good of humanity then all of our lives will improve to the heights we dream about and our social systems will excel and grow to be better than we ever experienced. We will realize the abundance the world has to offer not only now but for future generations. Still, if each of us don't care for the sake of everyone we will continue to experience more negative phenomena in the world. This isn't Utopian fantasy this is the laws of Nature.<br>  <br>  Nothing of what we have have built through history no longer works because the driving force behind all of our social systems is our selfish egoism. Sooner than later we need to become to understand and educate ourselves of the new state of the world. Even possibly begin to influence the heads of our countries and governments to start teaching the masses what it means to live in a global integral world. So on the media, tv, radio, newspapers it will be explained to us the world we now live in. Its understood the heads of our countries only care for their power and their egoistic ideas. Yet the global wold is our reality and man is not above this unbinding law of Nature of altruism. The masses will have to reach the necessity of what it means by global and push their countries leaders to this understanding. In the meantime its preferable we do not wait on our leaders but we take upon ourselves this education of the world we now live in. <br>  <br>  We can choose to leave our old connections of selfish egoism behind and choose a connection of altruism among us all thereby using this crisis as a springboard to a greater world. Or we can choose to be pushed by the laws of Nature, experiencing a increasing global crisis forcing us to realize the proper connection between us. The choice is ours. Is the same beneficial goal yet can we go to the hard way or to unite with one another, choosing the smoother way.  Hope I help answer your question and the links below express this necessity for the good of humanity.

The shock of this frightened and caused many savers to pull out their money from the banks, who found that their low amounts of reserves were insufficient, so they either became bankrupt or had to borrow money at high rates of interest. Some could manage to do this and others were forced to sell their investments at low prices, thus the stock-market suffered as prices tumbled. But this also resulted in there being less money being spent on consumption (particularly luxuries) and with the reduction in demand, the manufacturing companies needed less labour and unemployment grew.|`|qL17WQqUaa	as already stated there are lots of reasons, however it doesn't help that people leech off the country, lewis hamilton for instance, ( only using him cos he famouse) has all his cash stored in a swiss account, so he doesnt pay tax and national insurance and all that.<br>      also the toxic loans from america dont help, its made the banks sceptical about loaning.|`|P1XfUB9Haa	There is not 1 single reason but many attributing factors.
fofzdoROaa	Marx assumed that during the production process the so called "surplus value" of the produce was because the labour force had been exploited by the capitalists and was being paid too little wages. This assumption was flawed.<br>  <br>  Goods are sold for more than the simple returns that are due on capital investment (for buildings, tools and transports as well as their maintenance costs) and on earnings (wages). The third factor of production, land, also has a return (namely the ground-rent), which Marx chose to ignore. Curiously he did include it is a later argument. <br>  <br>  Had he included it his theory of surplus value, it would have corresponded with that of Henry George, who came a short time later and who is generally forgotten about, but whose equilibrium criterion in macroeconomics allowed for this third return. The effect of the monopolization of land on wages would thus have been exposed.

First, children are often more necessary economically since they are needed to run farms and business and to take care of you when they are old.  This is particularly evident in place like China and India where a male child is preferable because he will stay with the family whereas a female child will marry and move in with her husband's family.

Provided the music sold in one country can not be shipped and sold to the other country (the markets are seperate) and the "elasticity of demand" differs in the two countries then charging different prices is more profitable.

Almost sounds like you have a paranoid personality.  You never mentioned if you were on any medications.  This can be the result of medications or lack of proper treatment.  I wish you well.  You are only young - things will get easier.<br>  <br>  making friends isn't always easy but try getting out of the house more even if it is by yourself.  Seeing 'life' happen - if you are just walking down the street- may be more inspiring than sitting alone inside all day!|`|aDhZIhQcaa	It sounds like you have been through so much that you are hiding behind too many escapes, such as, movies, books, music, and computers.  That is normal when you are dealing and coping with a lot of stress, grief, and loss of your sense of self.  You are trying to find you, but you can't because those things that you are using, aren't human.  You need to learn to love yourself, by yourself, and for yourself.  Trust and believe in who you are based on you, not others opinions of you.   And don't be so hard on yourself.  It is normal for you to be going through this at this time in your life.  And face your fears with your head held high.  God bless you and good luck|`|bpqHzvgYaa	No friends?  perhaps you're claustrophobic. Get out of the house, put away your pride and socialize man!!<br>  <br>  Try to sleep at a fixed timing in order to get rid of those baggy eyes and sleepiness all the time.

Im 14 too and i know life can be hard just try to cope.  Join a club and maybe you will get friends|`|hOU7pYdmaa	Stop posting on Yahoo - it's ruining your life|`|lrWxPazwaa	yeah i would suggest going to a doctor|`|0Sro08acaa	Sir,<br>  <br>   I have had similar problems to you When i was 14 i suffered from M.E i was bed ridden for almost all of 4 years. All i had is my pc and i looked up very very disturbing things which lead me into a huge hole  which i couldn't escape from.<br>  <br>   I'm not going to lie... If you're depressed now when you become a man things will be a lot lot harder and responsibilities will begin to stack up. However find something that is peaceful and calming... and use it as a life force it can be anything that makes you calm and relaxed.<br>  <br>  I myself listen to music. Meditation music and pictures of gardens and nature are very very relaxing and instill a form of peace inside you. a couple of examples <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSqSyvAZYXY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSqSyvAZY...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGBJtkGQExM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGBJtkGQE...</a>   .<br>  <br>  Once you find something that helps you relax and calm your inner self everytime you are feeling down and unhappy use this to bring yourself into a calm again.<br>  <br>  Also find yourself a hobby that you can leave your house for and spend time with people who enjoy the same hobby. Join a club etc. as you will find people of different ages and can build important friendships with people who have different experiences of life.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to not spend time alone... as this damages social aspects of your life. I know, i have problems talking to people and my social skills are terrible now but it is possible to recover from all of this.<br>  <br>  You are still young which is the most important thing and recovery is definately possible.<br>  <br>  If you ever feel like you need to talk to someone send me a message i'm willing to talk and to help although i may not be the best person.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also do not take medication for depression it's the biggest no no. Depression happens for a reason and its because something in your life isnt right.. medication can only hold back the feelings...not sort them out... this is a mental situation and you must find support through inspiration and mental aid.<br>  <br>  Regards<br>  <br>  Paul|`|2ADABqY5aa	Well, the sleepiness suggests anaemia, so I advise you go to your doctor and get checked for it.<br>  Have you heard of a book called 'Just for the Love of it'? It's by Cathy O'Dowd, and there's a part where it's like she's trying to come to terms with the fact that leaving a stranded climber was the right thing to do. Maybe if you wrote your feelings in the form of a story, then you would feel a bit better (of course, you should make it seem fictional by doing the narrator as someone who isn't you), then hand it to your counsellor. Just say "I wrote a short story- could you tell me what you think please?" and he should get the message.|`|KZ1IbLQPaa	I say go to a counciler. I had similar symptoms and I am around the same age as you. It may have to do with the cerritonan level in your brain so I say you should probably get some help. I did and it turned my life around.

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	I suggest that you should make a concerted attempt to discern the identity of this other person.  You will not tend to let this issue go until or unless you find her and determine the relationship she had with your husband.<br>  <br>  However, the pain you feel about your husband's dalliances will tend to remain with you for a long time, no matter if you find out the details of his secret life or not.  And, you may never be able to forgive him or forget what he did.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you don't forgive him or his cohort.  But, you can eventually find the strength to move on with your life and realize that obsessing about these issues will not change them.  <br>  <br>  By moving on, you will have succeeded in usurping any control your husband now has over you.

Erm.. what else in life guidance matters.. ? <br>  <br>  .. oh yeah… you need to get back on the horse as soons as possible, some girl to distract you / use on the rebound.

The face that she know it is hard on you but it is her final decision. She can perhaps see that it would be unhealthily of her to give you some hope by been supportive. <br>  <br>  There is no easy why to get over someone you love so very much. You will analyse it and want to get back to the way your were but do you want to make someone you love so much unhappy too. <br>  <br>  You will manage to get over this trust me, I did. It will take time - took me 2 years but I was a stronger person for it. No one is expecting you to switch off your feeling for her and a piece of you will always love this girl till the day you are sat with grand kids at your feet.<br>  <br>  Counselling will help as you can get all your feelings out there - perhaps a reason you asked this question. they can also advice  on coping mechanisms for this behaviour if you feel you need it. <br>  <br>  It takes time love - don't expect miracles. Expect to feel s**t for some months but eventually the fog will lift!<br>  Good luck
f9YSZeMzaa	Yea, I've had a bunch of episodes. And if you have researched it you should have read that the episodes aren't easy to explain.  My episodes vary. The first few times I had them they were scary, I was frozen i couldn't move, there was a thunderous rumbling in the back of my head and i was struggling to move, but without success. <br>         I've learned to accept them and not try to struggle out of them anymore, ever since then my episodes have been a little different, I fall into dream like states, and out of body experiences. <br>  I've had one where there was a bunch of voices in my head speaking but mostly laughing all at once, i could identify some voices, one of them was my friend's. (none of the voices tell me to do things)<br>  My episodes don't scare me as much anymore, when they happen i accept it, I just relax and let it happen, I try to make them good or dare i say enjoyable. <br>  I've also had a couple where I feel I'm moving, my arms and legs are moving and it feel SO real, but I'm really not.|`|nadzplfaaa	Ugh... I've had it about every other day for around six months. There's this little demon/gargoyle thing at the bottom of my bed with bright yellow eyes and it walks over to me and chokes me. All I can think is "It's going to kill me, it's going to kill me, I'm going to die".  And sometimes I can hear really creepy singing voices in the back of my head, followed by footsteps. There's other things too, I just can't think of them right now.
3TpW5WNTaa	Nothing is wrong with you just get over her. If you really liked her then its going to be hard. Look they are a lot of girls and girls like a guy with confidence just go around school and start taking to other girls. Socialize more then eventually you will find a girl that you have a lot in common. Just get outside. Do not be in your room the whole time. Explore the world. Good luck|`|4NI6QDDuaa	kinda. well, i guess it could just be your natural grieving process.|`|1iPWFbxnaa	yap something is wrong with you but atleast you know it. do something about it. call your friends, go out, have fun... or maybe you just need somebody to talk to, your best friend perhaps or your siblings or your parents. you are just sad, feeling alone, and especially, rejected. your young. there are a lot of stuff in this world and still a lot of rejections you will encounter in your lifetime. learn to deal with it.|`|FkyzXzm2aa	try getting used to life if you feel she dosen't like you get her out of your mind and try socializing your self (dont get too cool,but make it in a way people will like you and also find nice people who will take you for who you are and not what you have.i hope this works for you.|`|nIiHdGBRaa	you just need to get over it.   and cuss that girl out
Xa4Ov1Haaa	To me, a practical person is a person that knows how to actually get things done, but doesn't necessarily have the creativity to come up with special ideas. A conceptual person is a person that has the creative ability to come up with good ideas, but doesn't necessarily know how to make them happen.  In business, it makes a great team when there is a practical person and a conceptual person working together.|`|8tVMmzvoaa	A practical person would want to put ideas into use.  They would be the kind of people that take ideas and make them real.  A conceptual person is the person that comes up with the ideas and plans.<br>  <br>  For example, let's say two people are going to build a treehouse.  The conceptual person would probably do most of the planning, and the practical person would want to use his hands and get the building started.

8tVMmzvoaa	It sounds like, to me, that this girl has a thing for your guy.  She might have a crush on him.  She's obviously trying to push you away so she can have him for yourself.<br>  <br>  I'd keep an eye on the situation.  You might have to tell your boyfriend to cut off contact with her eventually, but that might make him upset that you are interfering with his life.<br>  <br>  As long as it seems like your boyfriend is remaining faithful, which it does sound like he is, I wouldn't let it bother you too much.  Maybe politely ask your friend why she calls him so much, or politely tell your boyfriend that you aren't comfortable with them talking.|`|7bf43d487015d45e6264f26c5f6c6374aa	It sounds like she "likes" your boyfriend, and is looking for ways to talk and hang out with him without you around.<br>  <br>  Have you asked her the same questions you have asked here?

I live an hour away. I do tend to get a little jealous when they hang out without me. Especially when I find out about it days later.

It helped me to talk to him about it and have him reassure me that I am the only one he wants. :-) <br>   I totally know where you're coming from. But if she started calling him at 11 or 12 at night I'd talk to her. Tell her you don't like her doing that. She's been your friend for 12 years, she should know when to back off.

sIzvOiPVaa	This sounds like a fine use of your time and degree. Your own homeless experience naturally gives you a firsthand understanding of how it feels to be out of sync with society and will enable you talk with empathy from your own experience to the young people you are trying to help. In this way your own experience of homelessness becomes an asset in the long run and should give you more credibility and resonate well with the kids you are wanting to influence. My brother works with troubled kids and uses humor, fun excursions and music to bridge the gap. He tries not to preach to them, soon they respect him and they want to make him happy. Good luck in your new career. Good choice!

A0bT01wvaa	Yes! I think that it has to do a big part. For people who have been like really weird as a child in school and stuff you pretty much have that same reputation throughout school and people just can't get it through that maybe they really are a different person now, than they were before. And from that, people just base their opinions on what others think about them and don't even really take the time to get-to- know them when they really could be one of the coolest people you may ever met.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	In general, I'd say children either do like their parents or opposite of them.

By being loved unconditionally a child will become secure and loving too!|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	I did a test a few years ago. I did a personal study (just to humor myself) and took a personality profile test several times. I took it in the morning and in the evening and twice in between. Then I went on a trip with kids I didn't know that were half my age and even in their teens for a 2 week excursion. When I got back, I again did the test 4 times the next day. I looked at my results and I indeed did change a few of my character traits (personality). Not much! But, there was a change, mostly in the area of patience. Now if my character or personality changed just a little at my age, how much more could it change during the "developmental years" by being in specific backgrounds at crucial times? Interaction and adjustment. It's how we stretch our comfort zones and increase the boundaries of our risk taking.
