20090203133546AAfDXIF	Health;Diet & Fitness	If I lose weight, will I see more progress in my pullup and chinup routine?	I haven't really made much progress in these two months. It's embarrassing. Surprisingly, I look more muscular from doing these pushups (i'm coming along just fine with the pushups), chinups, and pullups but I am having a problem with strength when it specifically comes to the pullups and chinups. I try to do as many as I can (maybe 3- lol) and then I try to hang there in the halfway position as long as I can. I think I weight too much and I blame it on the medication I take. Before I took this medication, I was always a skinny guy. I am 5'9' and I weight 180. I used to always weight about 150-155. Anyways, will losing weight help me to increase the number of reps I can do?

It doesn't hurt, it's not tender, no strange oder, or anything, just a bump. I just ended my period also, I don't know if that has anything to do with it. I am very good about keeping myself clean. It's on my labia majora.   I have never been to the Gyno. Because I have never had the need to.   Should I go and get this checked out? Or will it go away?    I know too much information, but I'm trying to give enough facts so that I can get good answers from people.   Also if this is a cyst what are ways to get rid of it?

20090203133455AA1Q8ZJ	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I think I've strained my left pectoral ?	Hi there, i'm 19 and a regular weight lifter.   around 2 weeks ago i hurt my left pectoral ( don't know how ) i think it was on the bench press.  i bench press up to 110kg sets. now i was working through the discomfort cause it really doesn't effect my strength (well not noticeably anyway) and I'd say used the bench press 3 times through the injury. last Thursday i thought id give it a break cause it hadn't gotten any better (no worse either) but i went to the gym yesterday and did a set and it felt the same.   I do not feel any pain in everyday life, its only using the bench press or doing a push up where i feel it. its right up the top of the pectoral close to the shoulder (but its not the shoulder at all, i did shoulder press yesterday with no discomfort).   I just want to know how long i need to rest this cause its annoying. i'm young and fit and this is my first "injury" if you could call that.      I will not appreciate any answers saying "just don't bench press" as its just what i do.

I looking for some straight answers as I already know that my Dads situation is not good.    History:   My dad has a stroke one year ago which was believed to have originated from the carotid artery.  He recovered very well with only long term memory loss.(on coumadin and heart pressure med due to stroke)   Over the past month he has shown increased memory loss and severe dizziness to the point where he can not stand or sit up....but this has slowly gotten better.   MRA done two weeks ago and another one done yesterday shows significant narrowing of the vessel at the base of the neck.  There was obvious changes (increased narrowing of the artery)in the two MRA's done only two weeks apart.   Dr. said that a massive stroke in eminent and that there is nothing that can be done.  What kind of time are we talking about generally and is there anything that can be done?

En estos momentos en televisa (mexico) están difundiendo una campa?a publicitaria de un producto "milagroso" llamado "io zen" (ionic spa). Supuestamente se trata de una tina para pies que mediante iones elimina toxinas del cuerpo, convirtiendo el agua limpia en agua obscura, supuestamente producto de la liberación de las toxinas del cuerpo.      Este fraude ya lleva varios a?os que dejó de consumarse en otros países, y hoy ha llegado a México. La acción es muy sencilla: al agua se le agrega una solución de sales de hierro, la cual al electrolizarse convierte su tonalidad de transparente a café.   Las personas piensan que el color café es producto de la liberación de toxinas de su cuerpo, pero sólo es producto de un proceso químico que se realiza con las mismas sales que se incluyen en el producto, simple óxido de hierro.         Si ya caíste en este fraude, qué opinas que se sigan comercializando este tipo de productos impunemente?

I work at McDonald's, so I get my break about 11am and I eat a sandwich or salad or whatever; usually the calories add up to about 700 (whoa I know). During work  I am constantly moving, literally. I am hardly ever just standing.       Then I am not able to eat until dinner which is at about 5 to 5:30pm. Usually I cook a meat, veggies, rice, potato, or pasta.       Then I usually have some dessert.      At about 9pm I always eat something, like a small sandwich or pizza rolls, etc. If I don't then I am staving at like 2am.      I have a baby so I get up frequently throughout the night. I am know I need more sleep.      Ok, so Why am I so hungry and shaky by 4pm? I need tips or some advice to help me not feel that way cause it is hard to cook and take care of the baby, etc. after work. I just get tired and I feel sick cause I am hungry and shaky. What can I do? Please help.

In my junior high, 7th and 8th graders went on this trip, basically a camping trip in the middle of winter. Since my period started on sunday, and the trip was on monday, I though I would be fine. I was given the talk, and got some regular sized pads. I had no idea my flow would be so heavy. It was the second day, so of course. I had on a regular sized pad and the bus ride to the camp ground was almost 2.5 hours. I was wearing jeans during the trip. When I got up, the back of my pants were "sticky". I made my way over to the group and realized that I had blood, EVERYWHERE, on my pants. On the butt. It was so gross. I managed to tie a sweatshirt around it but I'm sure some people saw all the blood! I had to stand in front of the group, too. It was late, so then we had to sit "together" and eat dinner. I managed to get my coat around me, before I realized that there was blood all over my seat. I got myself back to the tents and changed to dark pants. I got blood on the mattress, too. The whole week I bled, through coats and pads and underwear. It was horrible. It was my first period, too. From then on I wore a facecloth in the back of my pants, I was so afraid I was going to leak. Talk about a first time for everything!!!

20090222121533AA65lub	Health;Women's Health	4 periods, headaches, and a rash?	I have a couple questions, I'm 14 and have had my period for a year and a half, so its not regular.  In two months I've had 4 periods! I get one (it last for 7 days, my regular time), take a week break, get another, week break, get one take a week break, and am on my fourth right now! I'm pretty sure it's ok isince i'm not regular, but I want to make sure.       about every third period (in the past not now), I feel like crap, head aches, cramps, and i feel light headed.  For about 2-3 weeks I've been getting head aches about every other day!  So I think this could be hormone related.  My parents say it's just puberty and growing pains.  I do think my breast are starting to grow a little bit (I'm a AA right now)      Also I have a rash, about the size of a pea 3 places on my body, then on my butt something that looks like a group of pimples!      So I think the first two are related and the rash is just random.  What do you think?   I haven't gone to the doctor.            P.S.  A few times before I have gotten 2 periods in one month.  And acording to my BMI I'm under weight.  I'm almost 5'5'' and i weigh 90 pounds.

None of my friends know him & he seems to thrive on attention when I look at him in class-(when I am not looking at him, he will bring up stuff I have talked about).      I have a class with one of his friends but only talk to him in class. His friend has asked me twice what I think about this class and tells me I will make a good friend & how he is a good friend of his & says I will make a good friend.      I do think he's cute but it creeps me out when he brings up irrelevent stuff that I have talked about outside of this class with my good friends. It's like he knows me or something. I can't say I have seen anyone lurking out my window or anything but I just find this weird.      Your thoughts??      ps I am in college

With the artificial bridge, the gums have a tendency to recede and before the permanent one is put in place its necessary to see what develops.  My question is how much is normal?

20090222131638AAckVtl	Health;Women's Health	Im so scared. Am I dying?	Hi guys ...I'm really worried lately something might be wrong with me      About 3 years ago ... I started getting weak ..got all the tests done with heart,tyroid, bloods ...everything came back fine.      I still feel weak and faint from time to time ...my doctor put this down to panic attacks.      Recently I have got a dull lower back pain ... it kind of radiates down my thigh a little and sometimes I get a throb or two in my buttocks. I had it for 3weeks four months ago then it gradually went away now I have it again.       I have been to the doctor ..she took my bloods said everything was ok i was slightly anaemic but that was it. I told her about my back pain and she said I probably hurt it lifting something but it doesn't feel like a muscle strain and surely it would not last over 2 weeks.      Last month mid way through my cycle I bled a little and had some pain my doctor told me it was ovulation.       I feel a little funny all the time ..spaced out.Perhaps this is due to my panic attacks.      The whole jade goody thing has made me doubt my doctors ...I'm scared I could be dying and nobody is listening.      I am awaiting a scan to see if I have ovarian cysts. Could the low back pain be a sign of cancer? Please help me/ Give me advice      Today I got low back pain ... Im mid cycle right now its low back and I have had it for 5days bad ...it feels like period pain only in my back

20090222183459AAaFQB9	Health;Dental	Can a sinus infection cause sore teeth?	Hi, I recently had (among other things) a sinus infection, I started feeling sick wendsday and went to the doctor thursday where they told me I had a sinus infection. The doctor asked me if my teeth were sore, and I said no, because at the time they weren't. and then late friday I noticed that if I tap one of my teeth (the first canine on the top right) it gets a really sharp pain...it also hurts if I brush it (electric toothbrush) or if I eat something crunchy. Now I'm worried. Was the doctor asking me if my teeth hurt because a sinus infection can cause that? Or was she asking because it's a sign of something worse? I'm scared scared something is wrong with the tooth, but I was at the dentist like 2 months ago and nothing was wrong with it, but that dentist didn't take xrays. So can a sinus infection cause this or is it something to worry about?

Please include (school or work) lunches so that will make for 2 times 7 meals in a week.   It may seem a strange question but I just heard someone boasts that 14 take-aways a week saves 14 hours a week shopping, cooking and cleaning the kitchen!  I find it quite provocative. And this person also mentioned that given the high price of fruit and veg and meat, it was still even cheaper to eat out.   Provocation or sad reality?

Okay, this is kinda weird but noticed when I smoke Cigarettes after eating, or eating recently, I feel MORE light-headed/buzzed or whatever you want to call it.  I some-times feel overly sedated.      Yet when I smoke more on an empty stomach, i feel less of a buzz/light-headed.        Isn't it suppose to be the opposite!?!  It's weird... So now I tend to smoke when not eating, as I don't like feeling "too sedated".  Is there a reason why this happens?

20090222182505AAC7sZC	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Cold Sore Questions, Help?	I think my boyfriend has the cold sore..on his lips.   It's been there for two months already (I think) but I've always thought it was dry skin until my friend pointed it and out and asked me to check it out. As I look closely, it kinda matched with my research.. I could be wrong but to be on the safe side:      1. Could he gotten it from me? I know cold sores can be carried without having symptoms, but if he did get it from me, why did he only show symptoms recently, not when we went out? I barely share drinks and so does he.. I'm pretty strict on that stuff.   2. I know herpes isnt curable, but it could be healed or prevented. However he didn't cure it right away, using alcohol. I see it getting worse, like white-ish bubbles appearing in his lips. They're not extreme, but it's noticeable..is that cold sores? He also has red scabs near it, and that part is red-ish.   3. How can I kiss him? When is it safe? How to we become more safe, orally? I performed oral sex on him, but he didn't on me.. could I catch it IF it wasn't from me?      My list of questions go on but what should I do? He said it hurts when he doesn't put Vaseline on it.

All through out the day I've had this spotting, Sometimes it a little heavier then other but for the past hours I've only had a few dots in my underwear but when i put my finger up there to check my cervix it still comes out on my finger. Does this sound like it could be implantation bleeding?

20090222181702AA7bHC9	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Here's a medical question I'm nervous to ask...?	Uh, I'm a little nervous about asking this question. Here I go...      I use the internet a lot. I have seen pictures of people who have been decapitated and ripped in half and not given a second thought. But, a while ago, I was browsing snopes.com. And, on one of their myths, they included a picture. All it was was a picture of a man in a chicken suit in a living room. I have no idea why, but it freaked me out! That night, I got no sleep because I kept thinking about the picture. A similar thing happened to me when I was 6 (I got freaked out when I saw a picture of a cartoon character with bloodshot eyes). I don't know if this is a medical issue, or if I'm going insane. I'm worried.      Here's a link to the snopes site:    http://www.snopes.com/business/viral/chi...       Please don't make fun of me. Is their something wrong with my brain? You don't know how worried I am.

He is 11 and is like 150'ish and is 5'3". e really bothers me with his eating and exercising habits, especially since I am more of a fitness freak then him. Like tonight, he always takes the 2 biggest pieces of pizza. re never thinks about anyone else when it comes to food! He doesn't think that it is important to exercise, and is never motivated. But, he always cries when he is like I am fat and stuff. I try to help, but he yells at me, and then my parents yell at me. My parents try to motivate him, and help him, but he doesn't want to do it! I am scared for my brother. I want him to be healthy and happy. But, he doesn't motivate himself enough to do it! How can I help him to lose weight!       P.S: He swims 2x a week for 1.5 hours...Tap dances once a week for an hour. Usually nothing more then that besides gym class and recreation at school. Recreation once a day, and gym once or twice a week.

20090222164930AA8qGRr	Health;Women's Health	Broken hymen or some kind of sore?	Okay so I had sex for the first time a couple days ago and I've been really sore since. So today I took a look around down there and noticed a sore / cut that is brownish and is circular about a half inch across. There is one on each side of my inner labia right above the vagina hole and they are in the same spot just on opposite sides. That's makes me think that they used to be connected and the cut is from it splitting. But I'm not sure. It was protected sex so I doubt it's an STD but I'm worried cause none of my friends ever told me about this happenig. They said my hymen would break... But this doesn't look like that. It's like my inner labia split or somthing. Can anybdy tell me what's going on I'd relate to it?!?!

Two weeks ago I was on z-pack for a cold. It was a five day z-pack and on my 3rd day I started spotting. I had unprotected sex that night and it was 12 days before my period was due. I remembered that morning that antibiotics can interfere with BC and I know that it probably did because I started spotting while taking the antibiotic. I tried not to think about it to much. I was 4 days late on my period and just got it yesterday, or at least I thought it was my period. It only last one day and was extremely light, I didn't even need to use a tampon and it was dark brown and maybe a little bit light red. I have a few spots today and that was it. I don't know could that have been implantation bleeding. It has been a total of 14 days today since I had sex, I took a test two days ago because I was nervous I didn't get it and it was negative, but if this was my implantation bleeding then I don't know....basically I need some help, when can i test again????!?!?!?!

20090222180445AAZ1lvL	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Serious health question about me passing out?	Ok this is concerning me very much. I spent the night at my freinds house last night, and we just chilled and played some video games.. then went to sleep. In the morning, as i got up to go to the washroom, i got that "got up too fast feeling" (im sure you all know this feeling) ... so i continued on to the washroom.. figured it would die down like it always does. But then out of nowhere, i woke up on the floor outside the bath room with my friend hovering over me asking me what happened. I dont remember exactly anything inbetween the black out.. but he said i was still for about 5-10 seconds then i got up and went to the washroom. I was lucky i didnt hit my head on the floor, but landed on my arm. I mean this is very strange because i get that feeling ALL THE TIME! and it was no big deal untill now.. that was the first time ive accually passed out from it. My parent say i need to get a blood test done too see what the problem is... but i want to know if i should get treated immediately. Is this severe ? is this a symptom of anything? Please help. Im a 15 year old male, 130lbs, 5.4" . Thanks for all answers, if i know how ill give as many points as i can for a good answer. THANKS!

20090222183315AA6gZHv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Vitamins to thyroid.Real? How do you get thyroid cancer? How does your thyroid "die" without cancer?	Within the last two years my mother was diagnosed with anything from Minears, to B12 deficiency. She has gained about eighty pounds, and was always tired. A couple of months ago she went to an ENT. When she went there they did a biopsy on her neck and found that her thyroid was dying. She got it removed two weeks ago and the doctor said the surgery was a mess, because her thyriod was decaying inside of her neck. The doctor said that it was almost all nodules. Now she is on Synthroid, the medicine to replace her thyriod. She has lost weight, got more energy, and is a whole lot happier. So here are my questions: How does your thyroid die without thyroid cancer? How do you get thyroid cancer? Has this happened to you, or someone you know?

20090222184044AAWIjNJ	Health;Men's Health	I might have ruined my family and my father punished me so severely and I'm afraid he'll never forgive me?	I just found this website and I am in desperate need of advice. I think I might have ruined my family tonight.      This afternoon my parents went somewhere with my aunt and uncle, and they all went in my aunt's car, leaving my dad's car behind. He also left his keys. I am 16, and I just got my license but my parents don't let me drive alone yet, but I really wanted to go to my boyfriend's house so I.. pretty much stole my dad's car. I thought no one would notice and it wouldn't be a big deal!      But something HORRIBLE happened. My boyfriend and I went to the mall, and what must have happened is the keys must have fallen out of my purse, and I think someone found them and used the locate car feature to find the car, and they stole the car... I had to call my parents and tell them, and they and my aunt and uncle came to the mall, and they took us to the police station and my parents filed a report, and then my aunt and uncle drove us home..      My mom was crying and my dad wasn't speaking to me, but when we got inside he just started shouting at me and my dad has NEVER shouted at me before, I know that sounds hard to believe but he hasn't! And then he grabbed me and yanked down my pants and underpants and pushed me over his lap and started spanking me REALLY hard and yelling at me about how he might lose his job now cause it was our only car and he doesn't know if he'll be able to get to work and he kept spanking me and spanking me and it hurt SO bad, and I've never been spanked before and it was so embarrassing and I was crying and my mom was crying and my bottom felt like it was on fire and it still kind of does, and when it was over he yelled at me to go to my room.      And so here I am, and I've been up here for a few hours and I don't understand what's going to happen now! Did I ruin my family? My mom was saying things would get worked out in the morning when he can talk to the insurance company but my dad was SO angry and he seemed so worried. Do you think he hates me now? He's never yelled at me before and NEVER spanked me before, I think he must hate me! I'm afraid to go downstairs because I'm afraid I'll get spanked again. I've never been in serious trouble before!!

But i know the air is thicker in alabama and mid march is approaching spring so Im also concerned about polin and stuff.    has anyone here ever taken their Chihuahua to the south?

20090222194604AA195Xj	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why when I do physical things do my hips cramp up?	It seems whenever I play football or basketball with friends, or walk long distances both my hips cramp up in the same spot. It seems it happens towards the very extreme top of my quad around my hip and pelvis area. Sometimes the cramp gets so bad that I can barely walk let alone run. I'm almost 24, 5'7" and about 160 so I'm not old or overweight, though I'm not very active hence I'm not in the best aerobic shape. That I think might have something to do with the cramping and the overexertion. I'm just not used to it, but whenever I try to be in activities that involve a lot of running, walking, moving around, my hips typically cramp up within the first ten minutes or so. One thing I'm thinking is, maybe I just don't hydrate myself or stretch properly before hand, though sometimes even when I do that, it happens. In the meantime, what do you think is going on and what can I do about it?

Every once in a while they will be on her arms or legs but its mostly on her back.  I don't know where they are coming from as my husband and I don't ever have any.  Last night she was in the bathtub, and when I went to wash her off she had like 5 more on her back.  Tonight she's been playing in her room and she had 2 more on her back.  I don't know what they can be.  They start out as pretty much a white swollen round spot thats redish on the outside and then they just turn to red little bumps afterwards.  I put after bite stuff on them when they itch because she wants to scratch scratch scratch.  I do have 2 cats but I am thinking if it was a flea or something my husband and I would have bites also????  What do you think it could be????
