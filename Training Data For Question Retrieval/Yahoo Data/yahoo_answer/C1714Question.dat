20090219225559AARO30g	News & Events;Current Events	Do you dislike people that have a bunch of kids?	I do, I believe that 6 are too many unless you adopt them.  However, any more than 6 and you are unable to give each the attention they need.  Having this many kids also takes a financial strain, unless you are wealthy enough to afford them.  And collecting food stamps and welfare to pay for your kids you keep popping  out isn't right.  Even then like I said, the will not get the individual attention they need from their parents.        I despise people that have 10+ kids.

20090220001441AAZEze1	News & Events;Current Events	What is your take on Nadya, the octuplets mother?	Personally, in my opinion, I feel for those poor kids. I think they should be taken away from her, and givien good loving homes. No mother of 14 can give her kids the love, attention, and financial needs that children have. She could afford IVF TWICE, she has a publicist, she already had 6 kids BEFORE going through IVF twice and then had the octuplets. In my opinion, I think that with all the money, love, cards, balloons, etc. sent to some other familys who've made headlines in the past few years for having multiple births, she thought the octuplets were going to be her 'cash cow'. And I'm sorry, but if she could have afforded tens of thousands of dollars for 2 rounds of IVF, a publicist, what appears to be a nose and lip job...she should not have had to make a web site BEGGING for money. She has no job, she lives with her parents, already had 6 kids...why'd she have 8 more if she had no money? And, what irritates me the most is all the things she's said like, 'I'm not a selfish mother, I'm going to school so I can have a better life for my kids...' etc...She is selfish. No good mother CHOOSES to have fertility treatments when she already has 6 kids, if she were a good unselfish loving mother, she'd have concentrated on the kids she already had. Oh, and the pictures she released to the magazines, showing subtitles like, '14 kids in 3 filthy bedrooms', 'please send money so I can give my kids a nice home'. OK so I get being crammped, with 14 kids you would be unless you lived in a hotel. BUT THEY DONT HAVE TO BE FILTHY, BUY SOME LAUNDRY SOAP AND DO THE LAUNDRY AND PICK UP THE FREAKIN HOUSE! Just because there are only 3 rooms doesn't mean the kids have to live in filth. That is neglect. Anyhow, I could go on forever...please tell me your opinions...am I the only one who finds this woman rediculous? I hope there is hope for those innocent children...but that woman needs to take responsibility for her actions...

Most of you may have forgotten,but I remember well enough.When aircraft IC814 was hijacked,and it was found that one of the hijackers is a british pakistani ,Britain refused to extradite him to India,and even invited him to britain.(I am purposely not using capital B for britain,from now)   british politicians thaught that by doing this they are maintaining their  third-party status.But they did not realise,that by being third-party in this conflict,they are being the second-party(the terrorists)by default(reminding you,george bush said"if you are not with us,you are with them").Ofcourse this changed after 9/11.   Today when britain is bombed by the SAME terrorists,we dont want to do the same by supporting those anti-uk terrorists,as we dont want to be like british,nor do we like to be one of the terrorists.we are against the terrorists,always.   But what a pity,britain hasnt apologised for supporting anti-India terrorists even today!

20081030000533AAYCxeJ	News & Events;Current Events	Obama has ties with Ayers? is it true?	Smear groups and now a desperate McCain campaign are trying to connect Barack to William Ayers using age-old guilt by association techniques. Here’s the truth: the smear associating Barack to Ayers is “phony,” “tenuous,” – even “exaggerated at best if not outright false.”       William Ayers is a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, with whom Barack served on the board of an education-reform organization in the mid-1990’s. According to the Associated Press, they are not close: “No evidence shows they were “pals” or even close when they worked on community boards years ago …”      Smear groups and the McCain campaign are trying to connect Obama to acts Ayers committed 40 years ago – when Barack was just eight years old. Here’s what the New York Times reported on the connection:       But the two men do not appear to have been close. Nor has Mr. Obama ever expressed sympathy for the radical views and actions of Mr. Ayers, whom he has called “somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8.”          Barack has publicly denounced Ayers’ radical actions from the 1960’s:       Senator Obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the Weathermen group, as he does all acts of violence. But he was an eight-year-old child when Ayers and the Weathermen were active, and any attempt to connect Obama with events of almost forty years ago is ridiculous.
