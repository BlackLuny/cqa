0puMsQJgaa	Hey S,<br>  <br>  Perhaps I may share from Personal Experience.<br>  <br>  I had a 360 Blog here on Yahoo for over 22-months. I posed a new blog on average about 5-times a week.<br>  <br>  Last month, some "TROLL" copied my background, and my photos, and created a Pirated site. There were 3-TROLLS working together.<br>  <br>  Others of my 250-friends were... tormented by them.  After complaints to Yahoo... all parties involved were DELETED. I had to Restart my Blog which I did, this month.<br>  <br>  I have received warnings from other friends who this happened to.<br>  <br>  The "TROLL" is an immature person, usually in a semi adult body.<br>  <br>    They have Damaged Emotions, a Severely Retarded Mental Capacity and worse of All, take pleasure in disrupting the Lives of normal people.<br>  <br>  The TROLLS do not have lives, do not even have the Emotional fortitude to sustain any type of Healthy Social, Emotional or Physical interaction with society let alone with themselves, even in the Mirror!<br>  <br>  They are Pitiful Cripples Immature... Ingrates.  <br>  <br>  Not even Guantanamo Bay prison would be good enough for them.  They need to spend their Last Days in a Russian or Chinese... Slave Labor Camp!<br>  <br>  Thanks for Asking! RR|`|l6Jew1qAaa	1. The term derives from "trolling", a style of fishing which involves trailing bait through a likely spot hoping for a bite. The troll posts a message, often in response to an honest question, that is intended to upset, disrupt or simply insult the group.<br>  <br>  Usually, it will fail, as the troll rarely bothers to match the tone or style of the group, and usually its ignorance shows.<br>  <br>  Criteria for being a troll:<br>      *  No Imagination - Most are frighteningly obvious; sexist comments on nurses' groups, blasphemy on religious groups .. I kid you not.<br>      * Pedantic in the Extreme - Many trolls' preparation is so thorough, that while they waste time, they appear so ludicrous from the start that they elicit sympathetic mail - the danger is that once the group takes sides, the damage is done.<br>      * False Identity - Because they are cowards, trolls virtually never write over their own name, and often reveal their trolliness (and lack of imagination) in the chosen ID. As so many folk these days use false ID, this is not a strong indicator on its own!<br>      * Crossposting - Any post that is crossposted to several groups should be viewed as suspicious, particularly if unrelated or of opposing perspective. Why would someone do that?<br>      * Off-topic posting - Often genuine errors, but, if from an 'outsider' they deserve matter-of-fact response; if genuine, a brief apposite response is simply netiquette; if it's a troll post, you have denied it its reward.<br>      * Repetition of a question or statement is either a troll - or a pedant; either way, treatment as a troll is effective.<br>      * Missing The Point - Trolls rarely answer a direct question - they cannot, if asked to justify their twaddle - so they develop a fine line in missing the point.<br>      * Thick or Sad - Trolls are usually sad, lonely folk, with few social skills; they rarely make what most people would consider intelligent conversation. However, they frequently have an obsession with their IQ and feel the need to tell everyone. This is so frequent, that it is diagnostic! Somewhere on the web there must be an Intelligence Test for Trolls - rigged to always say "above 150"<br>  <br>  2. trolling (variation): Hunting for trolls.<br>  <br>  Trollers hang around under bridges with troll guns at night (since trolls turn to stone in daylight), in the hope of bagging a troll head as a trophy.<br>  <br>  As a VERY endangered (i.e. nonexistent) species, trolls are protected by law, and trolling is therefore illegal. <br>  <br>  3. A troll is a fearsome member of a race of creatures from Norse mythology. Originally more or less the Nordic equivalents of giants, although often smaller in size, the different depictions have come to range from the fiendish giants – similar to the ogres of England (also called Trolls at times, see Troller's Gill) – to a devious, more human-like folk of the wilderness, living underground in hills, caves or mounds. In the Faroe islands, Orkney and Shetland tales, trolls are called trows, adopted from the Norse language when these islands were settled by Vikings.<br>  <br>  4. troll (informal): someone who fails to bathe or keep their surroundings clean<br>  <br>  Hmmm...which one are you?|`|pqveENjUaa	A troll is usually someone who posts merely for the sake of starting an argument, someone who is just posting to be stupid, someone who posting spam, or the typical type of irritating poster who makes certain claims, defends them to the death, and thumbs downs every single person who doesn't agree with them 100%. Pretty much anyone who can't take a forum seriously and contribute. <br>  <br>  However, a lot of us more serious contributers are tagged as trolls when someone disagrees with our opinion. I asked one question once about Christianity, the one question I had that my pastor refused to answer, and I was tagged as a troll because a Christian who stumbled across my question realized that he didn't have an answer so instead of waiting for an intelligent answer so he could learn too, he immediately flagged me as a troll and started harassing me. <br>  <br>  It happens to all of us at some point or another. Just try to take the forum seriously, and make sure you weren't taken out of context or you didn't say something stupid when you are called one and you should be fine.|`|BhEsZMG8aa	Someone who asks a nonsensical "question" with no basis in fact, but asked merely to insult, belittle, or demean another person just for the sole purpose of angering someone else.

Just because they're scientists doesn't make em smart. Once they get one thing right I might start to listen. Until then, What a bunch of Idiots!!! Light traveling? Just stupid. How can you look at the sun and say that light travels? Would it not travel in every direction? You would never see it. Why am I the only one on this planet with any REAL Logic? You would never see the stars either. Why would light travel just to Earth and not in all the other directions? If light travels and we see the stars that proves the existence of a higher power. No other explanation for it. Well, scientific blabbering. Like I said IDIOTS. The more science tries to prove that God doesn't exist the more they prove that he does. Am I the only one that sees that also?|`|qBOPQQQpaa	More true is this......Religion ruins your life and ends the evolution of your soul  by telling you that you will burn forever if you do not toe the line...all coming from a just and  loving God...........an outcome is not an ending........|`|O3Pmwaruaa	I'm an atheist who loves science, but even science can't reveal all endings.

Science is used to study our world, and we study things by observing what happens.  That means we have to wait until something ends before we know how the exact same event will end in the future.  Since we can't replicate something like the afterlife, the universe, or other things we ponder over like those, we can't *know* how it will end by using science, we can only theorize.|`|i6QfwNTJaa	so says u.<br>  not very true, cuz no one really know the ending here. not even atheists like me. but the odds are in our favor if we were to make an educated guess to that.|`|DQjAGWXQaa	I'd rather know how something ends than waiting for it and it turns out the end part on the reel/dvd/whatever is non existent.|`|25qUTYLEaa	Haha!

You have NO sexual attraction to men.<br>  Were human it's ok to think that a guy is attractive. Im sure gay men look at some women and think damn she's pretty. That doesnt make them any less gay. They just think she is prett/attractive....and that's that no sexual attraction.<br>  <br>  My straight drieds are always askin me if i think a guy they are eying is attractive and I give them my honest opinion. And yet and still im 100% lesbian with no sexual attraction what so ever to men.|`|JT92LbRdaa	If you don't have a sexual interest, and you have no interest in being with a man, your a lesbian. Same way a straight woman can say another woman is cute/pretty/beautiful but have no interest in women at all.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	I just don't know.  If you'd have sex with a guy no probably not.  Every lesbian I've ever talked to hated the idea of touching a guys balls.  So, what do you think about kissing a guys balls (that may come up).|`|hQSQx83Taa	Call yourself whatever you feel is accurate. If you're not interested in dating men, then "lesbian" will probably cause the least confusion.|`|EbUSYjLRaa	i believe that would make you bi and that is a blessing to all men everywhere by the looks of your picture|`|CvDzpQREaa	u're still a lesbian.|`|BD8O7RR3aa	I am 100% lesbian and can absolutely appreciate and point out an attractive guy.  In fact, there are guys I think are very hot (jake gyllenhal - woah, leonardo dicaprio - my two favs), but I don't want to sleep with them.  <br>  So yes, the answer is yes :)|`|iHiwe2Zraa	hmm there a levels of bisexuality I guess if you dont see them sexually attractive your a lesbian maybe a little bi but since you said you wouldnt wana be with them I wana say lesbian|`|2RWayH3Oaa	It's okay for you to think they are and not wanting to be with them.  <br>  Personally I don't care to check guys out so it's not a problem for me.  Some of my lesbian friends ( that are married) have straight and gay friends and they sometimes comment about how cute so and so is, and it doesn't mean they want them.  It's only a comment.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You're lesbian.  I think sunsets are pretty, but that doesn't mean I'm sexually attracted to them.  Just because you can see attractive men doesn't mean anything; you'd only be bi if you were sexually attracted to them.|`|JY0Ix1rPaa	Well I think you said it yourself if you dont want to be with a guy sexually then your definitely not bisexual. I mean straight girls know when other girls are attractive that doesn't mean they want to be with them.|`|kavhzTXgaa	No, you can appreciate a good looking guy andd still be a lesbian. I think Brad Pitt is super hot. And I'm a lesbian
e66f1ef8d569cc63ffe5d9474c957b12aa	Good question!  The bible is the truth, as God's promise is stated in the Gospel of St. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and Acts.|`|I0TOw1KSaa	Because of where it falls in the Dewey Decimal system used in libraries.  It's in the 200's, under religion, right next to the books on Islam, Buddhism, Santeria and Wicca, Greek and Roman religions, Zoroastrianism, etc.  They are on equal footing, both on E-Bay and in the library.<br>  <br>  The 110's to 140'sare where they put the books about the occult, space aliens and ghosts and other existential things that don't exist but they also consider non-fiction.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just because I don't believe in fairy tales doesn't mean I don't know right from wrong.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you think the reason to be good to people is because you go to hell if you don't, like your Bible says, then you're missing the point of life.  And, you're the one who used Ebay to justify your belief in the Bible.<br>  <br>  I thought this was a legitimate question, but you don't want a serious answer, just an excuse to talk ****.|`|81SiImlSaa	You're kidding right?!?<br>  <br>  Actually and quite sadly, most religious texts are considered non-fiction even though they technically fit the description of fiction given that most do not have a factual basis of proof within them.

Fm7z09Kwaa	They are meaningless sexual encounters that last one night and that are menat just as a sexual satisfaction for both sides. I don't see anything fun about them, I think they hurt (emotionally) more than they help, I respect myself too much to do such a thing.<br>  <br>  And yes they are against religion, any person (specially the woman) who has a pinch of decency would never engage in this relationships.|`|iHiwe2Zraa	um basicly one-night stands are just where you go with someone sleep with them for the night and kick them out in the morning  im still a virgin so idk but I wouldnt think of them as fun cus there is no love behind its just sex so they can be hurtful|`|EbUSYjLRaa	i am for them they are fun and no one gets hurt if everyone knows the rules upfront|`|4KNESOnlaa	yeah they can be real fun......religion is for baby's....|`|qTRzRi8gaa	One night stands aren't really my thing.  I don't think there's anything wrong with them, and I don't care if other people are into it, they just don't suit my style very well.  <br>  <br>  If I want casual sex I'd rather just have a friend or acquaintance I could contact for such purposes.  You still know them, and are on somewhat of good terms, but you're not dating or having a serious relationship either.  I tend to like that better.  One night stands are a little bit too casual and impersonal for me most of the time, I think.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	They are where you have sex with someone for one night only and usually never see them again. Or if you do, you don't date them.<br>  <br>  They can be fun. I've never been emotionally hurt by one because I always knew it was just sex. I haven't had one in years. I usually end up with long-term f-buddies.
nS7koC7Oaa	No, Jinn are the opposite being, they share us the Earth but they are invisible, they are created from a special type of fire which is mixed with black smoke. Like us some of them are believers and some are non-believers, they eat bones and reside the filthy places such as dunghills, we always seek refuge in Allah from a certain group of them called Shayateen (i.e. satan), Jinn are not allowed to appear to us.<br>  <br>  As for the ghosts i assure you only psychos can see them :)|`|Izn1ye9Raa	No. Ghosts don't exist. <br>  Jinn are creatures of smokeless fire.

They are another life form which we can not see made from smokeless fire. <br>  <br>  But what people think are "ghosts" are actually Jinn.|`|aRaMjnQ1aa	Existence<br>  <br>  The Jinn are beings created with free will, living on earth in a world parallel to mankind. The Arabic word Jinn is from the verb 'Janna' which means to hide or conceal. Thus, they are physically invisible from man as their description suggests. This invisibility is one of the reasons why some people have denied their existence. However, (as will be seen) the affect which the world of the Jinn has upon our world, is enough to refute this modern denial of one of Allah's creation. The origins of the Jinn can be traced from the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Allah says:<br>  <br>      "Indeed We created man from dried clay of black smooth mud. And We created the Jinn before that from the smokeless flame of fire"<br>      [Surah Al-Hijr 15:26-27]<br>  <br>  Thus the Jinn were created before man. As for their physical origin, then the Prophet (salAllahu alayhi wasalam) has confirmed the above verse when he said: "The Angels were created from light and the Jinn from smokeless fire" [1]. It is this description of the Jinn which tells us so much about them. Because they were created from fire, their nature has generally been fiery and thus their relationship with man has been built upon this. Like humans, they too are required to worship Allah and follow Islam. Their purpose in life is exactly the same as ours, as Allah says:<br>  <br>      "I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me"<br>      [Surah Ad-Dhariyat, 51:56]<br>  <br>  Jinns can thus be Muslims or non-Muslims. However, due to their fiery nature the majority of them are non-Muslims. All these non-Muslim Jinns form a part of the army of the most famous Jinn, Iblis- the Shaitan[2]. Consequently, these disbelieving Jinns are also called Shaitans (devils). As for the Jinns who become Muslims, then the first of them did so in the time of the Prophet (salAllahu alayhi wasalam) when a group of them were amazed by the recitation of the Qur'an. Allah orders the Prophet to tell the people of this event:<br>  <br>      "Say (O' Muhammad): It has been revealed to me that a group of Jinn listened and said; 'Indeed we have heard a marvellous Qur'an. It guides unto righteousness so we have believed in it, and we will never make partners with our lord'"<br>      [Surah Al-Jinn, 72:1-2]|`|uIfbWdsvaa	no jinn is an arabic term for saying something like a spirit caught you, in another sense sort of like possesion but not really.|`|0iTNDPzoaa	Jinns can take a form of anything and are created from fire like satan.

And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. 12?His eyes are a fiery flame, and upon his head are many diadems. He has a name written that no one knows but he himself, 13?and he is arrayed with an outer garment sprinkled with blood, and the name he is called is The Word of God.<br>  <br>  (Revelation 19:21) But the rest were killed off with the long sword of the one seated on the horse, which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth. And all the birds were filled from the fleshy parts of them.<br>  <br>  (Deuteronomy 11:26) “See, I am putting before YOU today blessing and malediction.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 11: 3?and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah. And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. 4?And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones, and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth. And he must strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the spirit of his lips he will put the wicked one to death. 5?And righteousness must prove to be the belt of his hips, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.That's what the Bible says Jesus is the judge and if we don't want to be obedient to the word of god then we have to pay the consequences.(2 Thessalonians 1:6-9) This takes into account that it is righteous on God’s part to repay tribulation to those who make tribulation for YOU, 7?but, to YOU who suffer tribulation, relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels 8?in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. 9?These very ones will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction from before the Lord and from the glory of his strength,|`|ebGBynujaa	he was a serial killer|`|ea9034ad6966329de87f6387da3ab0fcaa	The parable represents the end when God will judge everyone, including you, and those that don't love God they will be destroyed.<br>  God gave us all, including you, a chance to show Him true love and to believe in Him but if you choose not to than you can no longer blame anything on God. <br>  <br>  The enemy spoken in your Luke 19:27 is satan and all those the follow him or those that have chosen not to believe in God or to hate God on their own. <br>  <br>  We are all responsible for our own future.|`|LZJPMl8raa	That was a parable that Jesus told regarding the king and the enemies.|`|6Y3mW1a2aa	No. He sounds sadistic.|`|AA10652430	idk

ZtHKL257aa	I believe whether a werewolf has any pleasure of eating people depends on the werewolf himself. Don't believe everything you see in the movies, Hollywood has the habit of taking our lore and change it into something that it's just not. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to make any jokes of werewolfs playing tennis or writing novels, but aren't they supposed to be at least part men, so wouldn't their interests be at leas human like?<br>  <br>  But if you're talking about their menu, well, they are predators, so I guess they'll eat what most predators do eat... meat?<br>  <br>  Werepeople are only part beasts, so they would stand like men when actually men, but real werewolfs turn into real wolfs, so the beast should rule there, but if you're talking about werewolfs as a "changeling", then I believe their posture would suggest something more like after man learned how to walk, but before man learned to walk without resembling the hunchback of notre dame...|`|vhlORK4Waa	They are mythological creatures, therefore can do whatever you want them to do, in a literary or cinematic environs.<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|NgRiFZ7Baa	Who knows, because who knows how many different kinds of werewolves are out there? Just like there are people that evolved with dark skin as opposed to white skin, werewolves may certainly have evolved differently in different parts of the world.<br>  <br>  The type of werewolf I personally know the most about changes every night except the new moon, with the transformation getting stronger as it gets nearer to the full moon. But there are pills that can be taken to suppress the transformation on every night except the full moon (we call them "werewolf pills"). This means that they only transform on the full moon in most cases. Then there are certain signs:<br>  <br>  1. If the person is on the medicine, then twelve hours after taking it they become angry for a brief moment when it wears off. This is usually probably before their normal time when they go to sleep. The anger gets more intense as the full moon approaches (but normally does not result in striking people or violence against others).<br>  2. A werewolf will have typically more energy than normal from noon to six P.M. than a "normal" person. This energy grows as the full moon approaches.<br>  3. A werewolf will seem (in human form) to be more tired as the moon gets fuller. This is because they need less and less sleep as the full moon approaches, and although the missed sleep isn't a problem, it is reflected on their faces.<br>  <br>  Other than that, it's a perfectly normal life aside from the occasional transformation into a wolf-like entity. Due to the fact that humans are not usually a part of the diet of wolves, it's not really a problem of eating people so much as being seen and hunted down. Have you ever seen the film "X2: X-Men United"? The film has scenes where Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) discuss being mind-controlled. They say that they can see what is happening but do not have control over what they are doing.|`|FI9IvzDQaa	Wherewolves are much like other wolves, except they never know where they are, and nobody else does either. This makes it easy for them to sneak up on prey, so wherewolves generally don't have to move around much. This makes many of them slow and lazy.<br>  <br>  But because they never know where they are, they bump into things a lot, which makes them bruised and sad. And because they bump into each other, they can't hunt in packs very well.<br>  <br>  But a little while ago, a bunch of wherewolves got together to form a Web site to help them figure where they were. Using GPS and where-wolf cards, they can plot courses to food, water, shelter and other wherewolves.<br>  <br>  It's too bad that so many of them are too lazy to use the cards! :)|`|Mapm6AI8aa	wearwolves are wolves which wear a lot of clothes, get it? thgey r not cannibals - unlike u...

"<br>  We're not told how many children Adam and Eve had altogether, but they certainly had plenty of time to raise a very large family.<br>  <br>  Adam and Eve were created perfect in every way. Their children would also, no doubt, be born physically and genetically perfect. Therefore, Cain's wife could be one of his sisters with no problems.

" (Leviticus 18:6).<br>  <br>  God does not condone near-relative marriages. Had God's command to Israel been given to Adam and Eve, and they and their children all obeyed it, mankind would have quickly died out. God, therefore, had to temporarily allow intra-family marriages to increase his earthly family. <br>   <br>   <br>  By the time of the flood severe genetic weaknesses had likely set in, making close-kin marriages impractical, so after the flood God reduced the life span of mankind to seventy years. This would prevent another population explosion of the pre-flood magnitude. (Mathematicians have calculated a billion people may have died in the flood.)<br>  <br>  One might wonder why genetic weaknesses set in. It's obvious Cain didn't care about God's law, else he would not have murdered his brother (Genesis 4:8; Exodus 20:13). If he disobeyed God in this matter, he likely disobeyed God in matters of diet (Leviticus 11; Deuteronomy 14), and ate whatever pleased him.|`|9btru19waa	Adam and Eve were not born. God made Adam's body from the dust of the ground and blew the breath of life into him. Eve was made from one of Adams ribs. They were the only humans in the Garden of Eden. When they sinned they were kicked out of the Garden. They had many, many children after that, and those children had children and so on. Adam lived 930 years before death over took him, so he had lots of time to make lots and lots of children. There was no birth control then either. There also was no incest law at that time. <br>  <br>  We are all related in the human family. No, we are not all siblings in the manner you speak of.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	"Sibling" is a brother or sister, as in sharing the same parent(s)<br>  <br>  Cain, Abel(if he did marry before his murder), Seth, and Adam's other sons married their sisters.  They did not have to worry about the modern occurrences of genetic diseases, because it was soon enough after the fall that those errors in the gene pool had not occurred yet.<br>  <br>  Technically yes, were are all related, as we all had Adam(as well as the genealogical line down to Noah) as our great(x???) grandfather. Every human on the planet is an "Adamite"|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	I know that they say that the first mention of Adam and Eve was on the 6th day of creation but when I read it it tell me that God made man both male and female and told them to be fruitful and multiply. I believe this tells us that there were other people that God made and then in the next chapter it goes into Adam and Eve. Now Adam was given the task of naming all the animals on earth and among them none could be found a suitible companion for Adam. Now that would have taken a long time to parade all of the animals before Adam to have them named. Possibly hundreds of years. Anywho I believe that there were other humans on earth at the time of Adam and Eve. The only other sibling that was mentioned was Seth....|`|26Qb0cUjaa	No one else was mentioned.

The Bible says Kain went to the "Land of Nod" for a wife, so evidently, there were other people. I have a few questions about this myself, and don't pretend to have all the answers. Beyond Adam and Eve, when Noah and his family went through the great flood, Noah had three sons and they all had wives, and Noah had a wife, so theoretically everyone on the planet is related to Noah, who is a direct descendant of Adam, and from whose line Jesus was born. That is one of the reasons for all of the begats you see in the Old Testament...to trace the lineage of Jesus all the way back to Adam. The truth as I see it is, we are all related in that we are all Human beings, whether you take the literal meaning of the Bible, go with the spiritual meaning of the Bible, or don't believe in the Bible, or whatever; hence, we should treat each other accordingly...This does not mean that having sex with siblings is OK. ; )|`|i444oWjjaa	Just those two.

No one is saying don't feed the baby what people are saying is. if you must do it in public view, cover up your parts instead of pretending it's natural but really you enjoy toe attention and creating a buzz.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Who ever said it was bad? Its natural as far as I am concerned.|`|rThIVk2maa	This should be done in privacy, or at least with a heavy blanket covering the infant and woman and in as private a space as can be procured in the given situation.

I don't see how it's fine to have girls running around skantily clad on beer commercials, but it's not ok to breastfeed a baby?  or it's fine to see killings, bombings, etc. on the news, but when confronted with one of the most primal and natural things (woman breastfeeding) everyone freaks out?  It makes NO sense to me.|`|UxU7qZGTaa	Honestly, I enjoy the sight.  I find it refreshing and healthy for a mother to take care of her child.

AA12006309	First, he's not handicapped, and I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be thrilled being called that.  And yes, there are people who fall in love with and have long term relationships with people who are disabled.  I've met quite a few.  They're people just like everyone else, with feelings and hopes, and are just as deserving of happiness as everyone else is.|`|fdkegbwgaa	yea if I liked them it would not matter if they had a disability or not. I had a great friend who had cerebral palsy he was lovely.  He was just he kind of guy I like however I was married at the time so we were just good friends.  but yea I see beyond the physical people are people no matter what there physical problems (or mental health problems etc etc)|`|3a72219446c9a5a85bf1448f6d4a2860aa	Sure. I had an uncle by marriage who had cerebral palsy and while it doesn't sound like my uncle's was as severe as your friend's I don't see why someone wouldn't fall for him someday.

I had wild crush on a man when I was 22 who was in a wheelchair.  I think he knew but he was involved.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	I have dated a man with a physical disability and was very serious about him. After I got to know him, his disability faded into the background. I almost never even noticed he walked with a crutch or limped or anything. He was always self conscious about showing me his leg because there was a large chunk taken out of it. But when I finally got him to relax and be himself and wear shorts when he wanted, it didn't bother me at all. So, I have to answer yes because I actually did date someone who is classified handicapped and it wasn't even a consideration because I loved him.|`|AA10665732	I'm not sure if I'd be able to do so. Depending on their handicap I suppose. There are server handicaps and not so server. If I were to talk to them and end up liking them I'd try my best to developing a relationship with them! Everyone should deserve the opportunity. <br>  The handicap he has is broad and doesn't fall into just one problem; there could be a few different ones. Although Cerebral Palsy is non-progressive it can cause things to develop early such as arthritis.<br>  I think I honestly could open a relationship with a handicapped person. I'm planning on becoming a Registered Nurse I think I could handle caring; that is if they needed it.|`|BHpqxFaVaa	give your friend a big hug for me.<br>  <br>  You know if they where a good person nice to me would never hurt a fly i might consider it. There's this kid at my school who's in a weal chair (don't like him in a sexual way) but when i was talking to him, i found he was a really good listener and he was quite smart. And not over the top smart if you know what i mean where every word they say comes out of an exslipeda. And the thing that got me was, why the hell do bad things happened to good people. But maybe its not a bad thing maybe being a surten way if a gift from god.<br>  <br>  Im 16, but i might of dated your friend if he was my age, and was like the guy i said above ^^^^^^^^ it would help if they had a nice face to, but looks are the last thing in my book|`|4mZd0Abnaa	I think in the end, unconditional love will overlook the disability. The person that falls in love with David, would be loving him for who he is. I don't believe that anyone who expresses their love for someone with a disability would be lying that they loved them, unless they're a cruel person. <br>  <br>  The right person just has to find him, vice versa. <br>  <br>  My wishes go out to David.|`|Qnop8tkjaa	Sure. But it does depend on the type of disability. If he had a disability to where I would have to become sort of a health provider (such as changing urine bags or lifting him up out of bed, etc) I wouldn't want to start a relationship with him.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, my husband is very able bodied, but if he were to become disabled I would be there for him.|`|Nx1BaFPKaa	well ya i guess i would. i have a friend who's boyfriend got into a accedent and for a long time they didnt think he would ever walk again, and he's in a wheel chair, but he's trying to work on walking.

I sent you one and then you chose my question as a BA and I saw your message about if I got your email or not (which I did and as I said, I emailed back..) So yeah, I did email you. I'm just not sure if you got it or not.|`|upvd5TRRaa	i used to see a guy who walked with a highly noticeable limp.  in order to keep from falling down, he had to wear a leg brace.  one whole side of his body was what he called "half asleep".  he had had blood clots in his brain - the first one was at the age of 15 & the second at 32.  he was 45 when i dated him, which was almost a year ago.  he is a great person & i didn't care that he had that limp.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	I'm not now in a position to give someone "constant care" -- whatever that means.<br>  <br>  But if I were free, sure I would consider it.<br>  <br>  Just because he's in a wheelchair doesn't mean he's not adorable with a delightful personality.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Absolutely. I work with 3 to 6 year olds with handicaps and they are some of the most loving children and most hopeful you will ever meet.|`|BD8O7RR3aa	Wow, that's a difficult situation and my prayers go out to David.  I have no doubt he will find someone who will love him for who he is and support him through what he goes through, but I don't think I could date someone with cerebral palsy (personally).  <br>  If I was dating someone and they developed it, that would be different, but I'm not sure I could see myself starting a relationship knowing someone had such a difficult thing to deal with.  <br>  BUT - as you can see, many people would date someone in David's situation so tell him not to lose hope.

LuN1unJ3aa	An interesting story. I think the event made international news, as well.<br>  <br>  Justice demands justice and only mercy can overcome any penalty. Is it fair for a person to steal money and not repay it? Or can we excuse any kind of criminal activity against society or other humans without requiring some sort of retribution?<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the eye-for-an-eye system is indeed uncivilized (barbarian referred to anyone who was not a citizen of Rome, not a culture). But at the same time, justice must demand that the victim be given full restitution of that which was taken if we are to remain a civilized society and not give in to unlawful chaos toward any and all. We might as well subscribe to vigilante justice.<br>  <br>  So how would this victim receive retribution? Perhaps if the man who did this provided for her well being the rest of her natural life?<br>  <br>  Somewhere along the line, we must start providing for the victims of crime, either through the work of the criminal, or as a drag on society (as is the case in Spain for this woman).|`|wjCJhxPZaa	An eye for an eye makes the world blind...|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Before you get too rammy, you'd better check your facts.

If an eye is injured accidentally, the compensation is much less than if it was done deliberately and with intent to blind.<br>  <br>  .  There are endless comparisons between the Hebrew Bible’s “eye for an eye” law (which has always been interpreted by the Jews to mean financial compensation rather than an eye itself) and Jesus’ magnanimous philosophy of “turn the other cheek.”  It is undeniable that Judaism champions law above love, practice above faith, and religious service above theology and dogma, for which it has paid an enormous price in terms of popularity.  Judaism maintains wholeheartedly that love without law is nothing more than meaningless sentimentalism, which will ultimately end in cruelty.  As the popular saying goes, “He who is kind to those who are cruel will end up being cruel to those who are kind.”<br>  …”Paul’s excoriation and condemnation of the law has directly influenced millions of people to see only oppression in the Torah.” “Judaism rejects these attacks.  Law is the ultimate safeguard for love.  The separation of law and religion has proved to be a great calamity for human civilization.  First, it means that atrocities can be perpetrated in the name of God and no one can say that religious law forbids it.  Furthermore, the Christian rejection of law as a religious discipline would guarantee religion’s divorce from the world and its realities.  That religion has lost out to secularism as the mainstream guide to human life is a direct result of the detached role that religion began to play when Christianity abrogated the law.  To say that religion cannot be about law is to say that religion is not designed to regulate human life!”<br>  Rabbi Shmuley Boteach<br>  .|`|YTasscmKaa	If you understood the code in context it would make sense.

s1zitZMOaa	They are most likely in a plastic bag that is sealed in some fashion. There is nothing wrong with opening the urn. When my father died we opened the urn first thing. We just wanted to see what it looked like. There is nothing about the ashes that is unpleasant - it looks like ash and honestly has a bit of a pleasant smell like maybe they put something in there. <br>  <br>  They expect people to open urns up because they sell smaller urns so that you can split ashes up among family members. I have one such urn in my home. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, you aren't sick or anything else. You are curious and want to see them. Open them up, it's perfectly fine.|`|0wTzlG2haa	We scattered my mom's ashes so I got to see them then. I was the one who picked them up from the funeral home so I did take a peek in the container. They were in a plastic bag, but I don't know if that is the case when they are in an urn. It's okay to be curious. Is there anyone, your dad, a sibling, aunt, uncle etc who can help you to open it so that it doesn't get dropped or anything?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	I really wouldnt unless she requested them thrown into the river...|`|gDVQNMR7aa	I have some of my mother's ashes. They can't hurt you, and they are usually in a plastic bag which is sealed.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	No I wouldn't say "bad" How unfortunate for you to loose your mom so young and for you to have only been 15. I still have 3 cats ashes. What my partner and I have decided to do is whomever passes away first will have 1/2 the ashes. Wow tough decision. Keep her picture near it, write her a little love letter how much you miss her. She's always with you. And remember- to not talk about her or not think about her is not healthy. It would be like saying she never existed. Maintain altitude!|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	What you can do is find a store that sells empty small vials on a necklace and put some of her ashes in it and wear them around your neck. They can be very ornate some of them. Also there is a company that can take the ashes and make them into a diamond. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about looking in the urn they are just ashes and your mom is with you always. I lost my mother at 15 also .|`|uLEc9I2aaa	Ecclesiastes 9:5<br>  5For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.|`|RoYL4tyjaa	Remember what happened to Cartman with Kenny's ashes|`|tO9QjrEkaa	Let her go.

fBso80Ubaa	Here are some ideas you can use.

bJPRwCgNaa	This is because the red-head is always in the dumb blonde jokes so they think red-heads are all of a sudden are stupid. Alot of red-heads have freckles like in the book Frindle. There is a red headed boy with freckles. People have things against freckles. People are for red heads because they have seen some red-heads that are pretty like Lindsay Lohan. Its also very much depends on point of view. Also could be because of jealousy because if you have red hair you are different -a good different- a pretty different. Most people are born Brunettes or Blondes and they want to dye their hair. But you already have it naturally dyed. Jealousy hurts. Hope i helped! P.S. Fulanitos little sister answered this. It would be nice to be picked as best answers.|`|ZjXd1JVIaa	Well.. i can answer with a personal opinion. slightly biased, but not too much. I, personally, find that it depends on the person. a girl i know, Kate, is gorgeous. her hair's light red, with a hint of orange. and she has a few freckles. that, i think, is what bothers some people. The fact that, with red heads, your expecting freckles and, usually, tight orange curls complimented by smooth, alabaster-pale skin.People also have the false concept that all red heads are "Crazy", or wild. However, this is a stereotype. like the assumption that all blacks have big lips+noses and all white people are chicken legged and skinny. People have strong misconceptions about what red heads will act like or look like and as such assume that all people with that color hair will act as such. Personal choice, usually based on a misguided version of the truth.|`|ban4WJtMaa	things like thats happen not because of you its because of the experiance taht person has probaly had with a red head dont take it personally some peopel just dont get the fact that just  because you have the same hair color doesnt mean you act the same so just prove to them that red heads are the bomb and that you arent what they think|`|VcIN9CUKaa	Well being a red head my self I just think if your an idiot then you hate red hair because apparently your cool to your mates, if your normal you don't care and some people think it's the best thing in the world, it doesn't really matter it's just hair, and most people don't actually care|`|AtvEOfj0aa	I think  it is because re hair is unique.<br>  I LOVE red hair but my friend doesn't.<br>  It really just personal. <br>  (people who don't like red hair are just jealous) lol|`|ps31sr1laa	I love redheads.|`|UhnO8d4kaa	i dont know. people are always mean<br>  i realllly like your name by the way! <br>  hooray for latin! <3|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I think red hair is beautiful.

I personally like red hair.|`|SToOdHj1aa	<------------It's the same for people with no hair!|`|u93oneUXaa	Because people are stupid.|`|qpvZ5iclaa	I guess for the most part, red heads occur in smaller numbers than other hair colors.  And for some reason, I find that if a redhead is attractive, they're really attractive, but if they're unattractive, they're really unattractive.  Think of the bully from A Christmas Story or the Sherminator from the American Pie movies.  Then look at maybe Rupert Grint or Isla Fisher.  There just doesn't seem to be any middle ground.  My vote though is that redheads typically are hot.  Especially if they have green eyes.|`|ifvkj0Hbaa	hahaha you may read about the redheads, but if you think about it there are also many ugly blonds and brunettes in this world and fine once. maybe they just picked redheads because they don't have a ok. they are either perfect or ugly as hell.<br>  <br>  no offens to people, i like redheads|`|xL6McXTfaa	I don't know about who the person is, but when I say "red heads are awesome" I MEAN "red heads have awesome hair.

AA12006309	Sure?  A lot of fetishes would be considered sensory or paraphilias (based on our senses or objects, respectively).  Spanking would be considered sensory.  There are also those that involve control, either the exhibiting of it, or the relinquishing of it, as evidenced in a lot of BDSM and D/s relationships.<br>  <br>  Fetishes are such an expansive topic, as pretty much anything can be considered a fetish, from food (paraphilia, sensory) to shoes (again, paraphilia).  It's really difficult to discuss them all at once.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Obviously you've never seen the fetish map, which is really cool:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.obsidianfields.com/lj/sexmap1.0.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.obsidianfields.com/lj/sexmap1...</a>|`|iHiwe2Zraa	well people are usually direct about a fetish like a foot fetish, snm or a leather fetish|`|4Vswcoqeaa	This is a really good question.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of information on this subject.  Perhaps I'm not looking in the right places... if you can suggest anything, please email me, for I am struggling to understand my own nature with respect to a handful of fetishes.<br>  <br>  Right now, I'm going to say that these cannot be categorised.  There are hundreds of fetishes.  In fact the number is probably growing.  Who knows what kind of paraphilias will emerge among those being born today?  It seems to me that each fetish that you can name is unique.  Several can be overlapped into a single sexual encounter.  Two men might like the same sort of thing, but for different reasons.  One or the other may be turned off if the context changes.|`|ee55596d8b885055eeb6bc7e9957fa4faa	Well... if you can get a peek as a guest member of alt.com... they have a pretty large list of various fetishes, fairly well categorized.|`|4KNESOnlaa	Smell (e.g. body odor/feet etc.)|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	Just a tip regarding fetishes and psychology in general...<br>  <br>  Don't disease-ify everything, like the DSM tends to do. While some people really do have issues, the DSM is not the be-all and end-all, and you should learn to treat people as PEOPLE and not as pretty little boxes of symptoms.<br>  <br>  THAT would be the "afresh" way of "treating" things.|`|MYIwyTpcaa	Perhaps start by Dividing into Physical and Psychological..Then subdivide based on the individual fetishes..even then I'm sure you will get some overlap ie some like spanking for pain, whereas some enjoy the humiliation aspect of it, wheras others may enjoy the infantile regression aspect. The DSM-IV-TR is one step removed from classifying many paraphilias as outright disorders, so it tends to be a little stodgy.

rtqeG56Yaa	girl, i said the same thing. it does not matter how long ago it happened, what matters is that it happened. the effects still lingers in society and fuels stereotypes of black people. <br>  so check out this article (it might be lengthy but its worth your time- its juicy and oozes the truth)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.redroom.com/articlestory/color-conscious-white-blind-race-crime-and-pathology-america" rel="nofollow">http://www.redroom.com/articlestory/colo...</a>|`|npTZTzWRaa	as a young black man I have the perfect answer for you- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-8Ykfm4E_Y&feature=PlayList&p=962D930FE3DEFEDB&playnext=1&index=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-8Ykfm4E...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  and trust I realized this a long time ago and im only 19<br>  <br>  <br>  @Kathi R- what a stupid rant|`|557f121bfd3b4b87eb6c5214cbb1e223aa	It's easier than being called a liar than having other white people hate you.  It's better to blame - and it's not just white people blaming black folks.  It's class blame (rich man is always to blame for financial downfalls), religious blame (Christians are quick to blame the devil for something), etc.<br>  <br>  There are horrible people of all races.  I live next door to a black family I wouldn't trust to feed my dog -- and I'm BLACK too!!  And I blame them for my declining property values, the trash in my yard, and for being downright ghetto.<br>  <br>  Black men have a bad rap, but until they start to solve many of their own problems (looking up to gangstas, want to be thugs, dressing like they just got out from a 5-10 sentence, etc. etc.), then those issues won't go away.  Sistas are still out educating, out classing, out earning, and out living black men.  The ball is in their court.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Wow you bring up a case that happened years ago.

A black carjacker would have been a more believable story to most of the people in that area, considering the demographics. Luckily the main investigator (I have seen him interviewed many times) was on to her evil a** from jump street. It's the same situation with the Duke rape case. Many Black people jumped to conclusions before all of the evidence came to light. It's clear now that that woman was never raped by those Duke students, but they were convicted in the court of black public opinion for the most part. The same thing happened in South Carolina. It's easier for white people to believe a white single mother of two boys over a made up black boogie monster. Justice is blind, but sometimes the people in charge of enforcing it are not.<br>  <br>  Your second paragraph suggests that whites are the only people capable of committing such heinous crimes against their own children. I have no idea where that comes from.|`|xtKEToLHaa	What's wrong with you, Zoe?

Although God can be blamed to some extend for granting the person responsible free will, but it would have been purely up the the person responsible to make the descision they did.<br>  So, i suppose you can't really say it was Gods plan when someone does something wrong, because to some extent it was actually their responsibility how to use the free will they recieved from God.<br>  I am not at all trying to impose my beliefs on anybody by the way, i believe diversity is a brilliant thing and i think understanding and apprieciating the cultures of those all over the globe is an important thing to allow our societies to move on from whatever problems are going on right now.|`|87a314e32e539f5a1d4ac801229aaeadaa	I think it because it has become such a "pat" answer. If someone passed away in my life, and someone told me that, I would be like, Well, duh, God controls everything, but that also make me temp. mad at God for doing that.

AE2iQVKRaa	Ossachite, the name given by anthropologists to the first settlement in the area, was made over 6,000 years ago by the Timucua Indians in the vicinity of modern-day downtown Jacksonville.<br>  European explorers first arrived in 1562, when French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault charted the St. Johns River. René Goulaine de Laudonnière established the first European settlement at Fort Caroline two years later. On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed nearly all the French soldiers defending it.[<br>  The first permanent settlement in modern Jacksonville was settled as "Cowford" in 1791, ostensibly named for a narrow point in the St. Johns River where cattlemen could ford their livestock across. The Florida Territory was ceded to the United States in 1821, and in 1822, Jacksonville's current name had come into use. U.S. settlers led by Isaiah D. Hart authored a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832.

hJSZNwJ5aa	I believe that everyone wants to be special. Which means a little different. They want to be the best at something, to be recognized as extraordinary or really freaking cool. But at the same time people are scared of other people's opinions of them and afraid of breaking pattern and habit to try something new.<br>  <br>  So they figure. Well I can be different from everyone by wearing black clothes and wearing black lipstick but still fit in with the "goths" at school. So they think they're getting the best of both worlds. Individuality and belonging. <br>  <br>  But labels are just dumb. And it's usually a phase people grow out of when they leave high school|`|ulhyTxoGaa	"we"? <br>  i prefer not to be labeled.  i am myself.<br>  <br>  i guess people do it to try to "fit in" or something idk.<br>  there's no sense in it|`|RhZaVwKkaa	Everyone needs a word to call something.|`|XczWlZumaa	to let people know what kind of person we are, most of us fit into one category or another:)<br>  <br>  answer mine please:)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Because everyone else is doing it.|`|Az8JInKdaa	It's human nature<br>  Labels are  important to boost our Ego.
KFyFmi1Iaa	Nope, not bad. As long as you remember that you're not the one in control and you're very smart about the questions you ask you should be fine. One thing you never ask a Ouija board is when you're going to die, supposedly it'll give you a date that wasn't your original one, meaning the spirits make it so you die sooner.<br>  <br>  Also the spirits you contact may...linger on for a little while. You might feel someone watching you. It's a little frightening at first, but you'll get used to it.|`|dYKyIWb7aa	any ouija board is bad, its a door to unknown spirits that will lie to you in order to get what 'they' want.  leave it alone|`|c1da7e8c20780c023c1facf13c5f80fcaa	Not sure but how would anyone use an online ouija board anyway?|`|sEPjAHX4aa	absolutely not. they suck and dont work at all. get a real one! they work! :)|`|VPCl2C9daa	no, it works by a process known as ideomotor motion, its perfectly natural, if you want to think it's ghosts, then go ahead, but it's not.
r9s0VyJgaa	NO.  At least not in the US.<br>  <br>  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the FEDERAL agency that has sole jurisdiction over Immigration questions, grants visas and green cards, etc.  And although same-sex marriage is legally recognized in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the U.S. Federal government does NOT recognize the legality of ANY same-sex marriages, no matter where they are entered into, thanks to the Defense of Marriage Act, which passed in 1996.<br>  <br>  So if a gay man from England comes to the U.S. on a visa, and marries his American boyfriend in Massachusetts, their marriage will NOT be recognized by Immigrations.  In fact, in some cases, their marriage could result in his being deported back to England.  When the U.S. Immigrations Department grants a visa to a foreign national, they do so with the clear expectation that the foreigner will go home to his or her native country when the visa expires.  If that foreign national marries their same-sex partner in the U.S., its a dead giveaway to the Immigrations Department that this person is maybe planning NOT to go home when his/her visa runs out -- so they could summarily deport the foreign-born partner back to his native England to prevent him from overstaying his visa and becoming an illegal immigrant. <br>  <br>  And yes, this whole situation is horribly, horribly unfair.<br>  <br>  The only way for this hypothetical gay Englishman to stay in the U.S. legally would be for him to have a blood relative in the U.S. sponsor him for a green card, or get an American employer to hire him and sponsor him for a work visa that could lead to a green card.  Student visas and tourist visas are temporary.  Of course, given the state of the American job market, good luck finding an American employer willing to hire a foreign employee over an American worker, unless your job skills are so rare or specialized that the employer can't find ANY Americans capable of filling the position. <br>  <br>  Probably better for the American to emigrate to England to live with his British boyfriend -- the British government recognizes same-sex domestic partnerships as the equivalent of marriage for Immigrations purposes.|`|sOeDTrPeaa	No the US government clearly bans gay marriage for immigration.|`|QZvvHp3iaa	I am not for immigration marriages in the slightest.<br>  <br>  But to answer your questions, no because the states will not recognize the union between a man and a man or woman and woman marriage.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is one of the rights that is stripped from preventing same sex marriage.|`|KurbTbCHaa	HONESTLY, its terrible if your just trying to get over here so you result in marrying someone you dont even care about. Stay wherever you are leave someones heart alone.
4aveC2aaaa	It is haraam because it is said those who listen to music now will have electric plugs placed in their ears. <br>  <br>  also, i read and hear somewhere that musical instruments excite the person. and thats haraam. sort of like a "high"<br>  <br>  it is haraam, i asked a Saudi Sheikh and many before me have asked.<br>  <br>  here look:<br>  <br>  The overwhelming majority of scholars consider music to be Haram, based on the following verse:<br>  <br>  "And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allah without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allah, the Verses of the Quran) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-Fire)". (Surah Luqman 31:6)<br>  <br>  Abdullah Ibn Mas’ood used to swear that the meaning of idle talk was singing. This view was held by Ibn Abbas (RA) and other Sahabah as well. Ibn Mas’ood used to say that music is to the hypocrisy as water is to a plant. The scholars are agreed that when singing is accompanied with music, then the prohibition is even stronger.<br>  <br>  The other major proof is the Hadith reported by Al-Bukhari with a partial isnad (mu’allaq):<br>  <br>  "From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcohol, and the use of musical instruments as lawful. Allah will destroy them during the night...and will change the rest of them to monkeys and pigs and they will remain so until the Day of Resurrection".|`|9NniKJcEaa	Only songs with string instruments are haram. others are fine. and of course the ones with the bad meanings.|`|koynaDYbaa	Music isn't Haram, it is Sunnah to listen to Music with no musical instruments however..

ZaSiPFvtaa	I can't see that ever happening, based on what I know about the canonization process, which is quite complicated.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there were times and places (Europe, various parts, Middle Ages) when Pontius Pilate was venerated (only locally, on a small level, and NOT with the RCC's official blessing) as a saint.  He was never officially canonized, of course, but he certainly got closer than Judas Iscariot ever did, or ever will.<br>  <br>  The play/movie "Jesus Christ Superstar," btw, does an excellent job of telling the familiar story from Judas's point of view.  Recommended viewing for all, religious or not.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	Judas committed suicide. Because of that he can never be made a saint.<br>  <br>  Justification by way of his effect on Jesus is irrelevant. If that were the case, we'd canonize Pontis Pilate, Barabbas, the guy who wove the crown of thorns, and the soldier that put the spear in Christ's side.<br>  <br>  A saint is a person who, by their lives and by the incident of miraculous intervention after their mortal bodies die, has given us on earth knowledge that they are interceding for us through their new lives in paradise. This is why the church requires two miracles as evidence of their sanctification. <br>  <br>  Judas, despite what the "Gospel of Judas" may say, was a man who suffered a great deal in his life, and at the end of it, could not accept that God would forgive him for his sin. He killed himself. There have never been miracles associated with him. He may have been forgiven and entered paradise, we don't know. But he is no role model, or intercessor.|`|1d0cc0ea5546dfbb6d1b826ce4a34599aa	All living Christians are called saints by the bible. As for Judas Iscariot, he still betrayed his Master Jesus even if he's fulfilling the prophecy in the Old Testament. He chose it by his own free will. He could have repented and be a saint but he refused the grace of God by committing suicide. He cannot be canonized.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	It is not what you do what matters, it is why and whom you do it for.|`|4OEOxOmPaa	According to the Gnostic Gospel of Judas Iscariot. I enjoyed reading it.|`|XKzUsb7zaa	I think he should be made a saint you are right he instigated Jesus fulfilling his destiny.|`|9n6wAFUDaa	Judas was created to betray Jesus, and he did, so I guess he was doing the Lord will, not sure if that makes him a saint or not.|`|gFqeMs22aa	my thoughts exactly, that is why the church supressed the gospel according to judas.|`|eWuHS9OUaa	In one of the Gnostic Gospels (outside of the Bible), Judas worked in cohesion with Jesus in order to set Jesus up for crucifixion. (The Gospel of Judas).<br>  <br>  Most Christians believe that Jesus was betrayed by Judas, in accordance with the Gospels.  <br>  <br>  Many Christians believe that Judas acted according to his own Free Will, and therefore, betraying Jesus was an action that Judas was personally responsible for.<br>  <br>  The Reformed Christian traditions (ie; Calvinism, Presbyterianism), tend to downplay the role of free will, and would probably say that Judas was acting in accordance of God's will to betray Jesus. <br>  <br>  Anyways, most Christians overall would acknowledge that Judas acted both on his own free will WHILE working in conjunction with God's will, paradoxically. <br>  <br>  Since the Roman Catholic and the Greek Orthodox Churches are largely responsible for canonizations, it is unlikely that  Judas will ever be canonized. Both of these Christian religious traditions do not accept the validity of the Gospel of Judas, and would believe that Judas was largely responsible, in many ways, for the death of Jesus.\<br>  <br>  So, should Judas be canonized? Most Christians would say no.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	What would the story be without good ole Judas?<br>  <br>  In Jesus Christ Superstar Judas says... "Christ, you have murdered me!"|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Scripture is clear that is the one thing HE DID NOT DO.<br>  <br>  See Acts of the Apostles :<br>  <br>  "After he was arrested according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified this very man and killed him by the hands of lawless men."<br>  <br>  PREDETERMINED PLAN AND FOREKNOWLEDGE OF GOD.|`|AA11008046	Definitely not.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Yeah, sure. Why not? I would vote him to have canonised, if them officials allows us.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No he betrayed Jesus.|`|NCRfZRopaa	You know, if it wasn't for Judas, Jesus might not have been killed.
RRxx1suAaa	Adaption|`|wh3BAc4taa	Light hair and blue eyes first started as genetic mutations. If you've seen and studied the hair and genes of the earliest people, then you can see that most have dark hair and dark eyes. It's common ancestry and common adaptation (Charles Darwin's theory) as time changes.|`|WJpJ6CVpaa	It is probably a mixture of both<br>  <br>  You get darker the farther south you go and the closer to Africa you go (look at Turkey, they are darkish) <br>  <br>  It must be a mixture.|`|Amf1wtJmaa	common ancestry|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	common ancestry|`|MDgVPwU3aa	both|`|HLqzrBNmaa	BTW to the guy that said that thing about Turkey - well Turks are actually far from being 100% white while Italians are only 80% ethnic European according to genetic studies. So I think its more common ancestry that originated from common adaptation.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	I would assume a combination of the two.|`|hZltMpiPaa	common adaptation.<br>  <br>  cuz if you think about it...Russians look similar to English people.  but Russia is part of Asia and England is an island in the West...<br>  <br>  i mean of course everybody has common ancestry if you go back far enough, but it's pretty obvious it has more to do with your distance from the Equator than your direct lineage.  i mean north asians look similar to icelanders, and if they have common ancestry its WAY back...same with african people and aborigines...|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	It's more common adaptation<br>  not all europeans have the same ancestry..there are many exeptions.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	ancestry|`|eZCCSMykaa	dunno

That’s not right you should only be concentrating on your salah.<br>  <br>  If your finding it difficult to concentrate in salah then there is several ways you can try to improve your concentration.  But listening to the Quran or anything else in that matter is not right because you should be trying your best to concentrate on your salah.<br>  <br>  You might want to ask a scholar or an imam they will give you a better answer inshallah.<br>  <br>  Edit: Your saying it helps you concentrate but how does it?

nEc0L0MRaa	I don't think you have conjured something.  I think you have allowed something to grant your wish, remember to be careful what you wish for.  Music is something that people have used for thousands of years to relate emotions and communicate with each other.  It would be foolish to think that an Immortal force would not have a way of expressing themselves through music.  As a musician I would suggest you be grateful that such forces are allowing you to speak for them.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Sounds clevr to write such evocative music.

70eI3d88aa	I agree with the other answers. Also, I would like to add, there are many phases that we face through life at different stages...and you being 21..is a typical age of confusion..or I would say a beginning phase of self analyzation. Its ok to question your own self, your identity, your meaning and worth of life, things that make you sad, things that make you happy, your sexuality, and etc. Its a good thing to have answers for some of them ..and if you don't have answers to all your questions, its perfectly normal. You should always have questions, you will learn yourself better that way. I'm a bit of philosophical person myself..and kind of been through similar situation in life..where I felt I don't know how to love because I've never experienced it in the family. however, I did learn its important to learn to how to love your own self. Once you occupy yourself with things you may like to do..you will become your own close friend.. But I would like to share these two quotes that you may like. These are something I kind of live by..<br>  "The Purpose Of Life Is A Life Of Purpose"  <br>  <br>  " Experience is the hardest kind of teacher. It gives you the test first, and the lesson afterward."  <br>  .<br>  <br>  I can write a lot...but I don't think I want to bore you with lectures..but let me tell you something. I am 25, graduated with a major i realized I didn't want and in a career that I never thought I would be in. I realized i wanted to change my major during the last semester and it was too late. So I chose something that interest me and declared it as a minor (which was philosophy) And according to this article I read..about 75% people are not working in the field of their passion...so don't feel like you're the only one confused. =o)|`|CvDzpQREaa	omg we're so alike. except I'm interested in sex :P<br>  <br>  So here's what I do: I will try to do stuff to fill the vacuum that has been inside me for many years. This is the main idea, but there are maaaany details that must be taken care of, otherwise everything will just collapse again. I'm thinking of stuff too, I even think too much and can't sleep because of that (can't silence my brain). I also question my own identity, I tend to believe that I have no unique personality and that I'm merely an actor who plays whatever role he thinks might be useful for him. Sometimes I even thought "hey, I'm hidden, this body is like a shield made of a material that can be shaped in any form. I don't care what shape it has and what others think about it, I'm just inside and hidden. I can play with shapes and observe others for my amusement." it was weird. Of course it kinda changed. But I'm still empty.<br>  <br>  apathy sux. a lot. "Je est un autre" applied to me many times. <br>  <br>  oh lol I've soo many things to say about this, because this is what I do: auto analysis. All day long. But now I'm trying to change that and focus on other things. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  so my advice is to do stuff and stop over thinking. As long as you're still empty, your mind will only perceive the vacuum. I do this by lying to myself, it kinda works. I'm used to grabbing illusions and making them a reality (in my head), but it's also a lie! It's pretty fucked up actually :( <br>  <br>  BUT I know there is hope, have you done everything possible to take yourself out of that crappy state? I know I haven't, that's why I couldn't commit suicide although I wanted. <br>  If all else fails, search through yourself for your most hidden desires and work on them, those might be a good start regarding enthusiasm for life/reason to live. Once you get on track, you'll be fine. :) Well that's my theory! I dunno if it works, but I do feel kinda better!!!
tQsxsuNPaa	Ummmm, of course it is right! <br>  <br>  You were absent!  They give you an absence.  That's how it works!  If you were sick, they can't give you a "hookey", or Illegal absence, but, if you aren't there, the definition of "Absent", then they give you an absence, because the definition of an absence is that you aren't in school.<br>  <br>  Now, if you are in the US, and going to a public school, the reason this works out this way, is that the state you live in and the federal government pay the school for every day and every student who is "present".  If you are not there, legal or not, the school doesn't get paid for you having been present....because you were not.  So, they HAVE to mark you as absent.  Or THEY would be defrauding the governments that pay THEM.  <br>  <br>  So...the school has to be very sure that you aren't there for a good reason.  Still, if you are absent, you are marked as absent.<br>  <br>  Would it be okay to mark you as "present" if you aren't actually in classes?|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Well, if you are absent you are absent.<br>  <br>  The only thing I believe is that it shouldn't raise your chances of losing credit that year.|`|HsT9sW5Xaa	No...It's just an attendance record, and serves to your own benefit. Your teachers, coaches, and the staff can then see what lessons/tests you may have missed, and if you had a legitimate reason to do so. It also helps if under the circumstance the teacher is away for example, and overall it cuts down on the amount of people skipping.|`|6p50zivoaa	Hi.no because ur not at skool and its not the schools concern on y ur not at skool,|`|77tcUSoUaa	I think it is alright to mark one absent if he/she is not present.It is simply an attendance record

24vQ8D71aa	it worked very well in this case.<br>  the mother was completely dominated by her son, who was on drugs, alcohol, on and off medication for schitzophrenia ,he was also violent towards her. she kept it secret and gave him food and money when ever he asked for it.to cut a long story short ,about 6 years ago the police were called after yet another violent outbreak .with counselling she stopped the hand outs, he went to jail ,then a facility for treatment , is now living independently. for the first 2 years she had supervised visits , now unsupervised and he does not know where she lives. he's pulled his act together and they have the best relationship ever.tough love and calling the police got him on the right road ,and released her from bondage.|`|y7HD8unTaa	I guess not.  It's my own tough luck that I had no love in my childhood....just regimens & daily beatings.  I refused to pass that down to my kid.  I'm just as lazy as my Mother accused me of being.  It's too damn much work to check on a kid 24/7 & be as over medicated as she was.<br>  <br>  The benefits for her was that she had no memory of her abuse on me...or she just used it as an excuse & died with it heavy on her mind.  I didn't want to have to live with passing that on to my own.  <br>  <br>  I forgive you...if that's what you need to hear.  Your first post was fine & so is this one.

swiOhDo2aa	Literally, "I had egg" - and it's as bad Spanish as it is English. "Yo tuvé huevos" (I had eggs) might be what is meant.<br>  <br>  Exactly what it means depends on the context. You should be aware that "huevos" in Spanish, apart from the usual meaning of "eggs" has the slang meaning of "balls" - i.e. testicles - and so often means courage. <br>  <br>  It is possible, then, that the speaker meant that he found enough courage to do something or other - without context, it's hard to tell whether he breakfasted on eggs or plucked up his courage in an awkward stuation.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Q3NM0StNaa	i had egg.<br>  <br>  huevo(s) would be eggs|`|NjJ1B7qPaa	I had egg

le9ZROs5aa	I say use the which ever makes you feel more comfortable and safe. I use the ladies room because that's where I feel comfortable and safe. The only real bathroom drama I have ever had was in the mens room years ago and that was the last time I ever used the mens. I just want to pee and not be hassled or outed so I use the restroom where the other people who look like me go. It's not like I'm trying to sneak a peak or anything like that.|`|30b5fac62378b9be69757aa6b696edf4aa	Personally I think it is silly...I use which ever restroom has the shortest line : )|`|sOeDTrPeaa	Well to answer your first question, it's because of rape and other very Obvious reasons.

I think it is just a matter of cleanness and also the fact that there is always sexual tension between the genders.  No woman in our office is offended when i man uses their nathroom.  Obviously in school or in the mall they don't have single stall bathrooms.  it would be a little weird to poo or even pee (for some people) with someone of the opposite sex in the room.  <br>  <br>  and of course transgenders can use which ever bathroom they feel most comfortable in.  there is no bathroom monitor checking to make sure that the people in the bathroom have the right "stuff".  I know a lesbian that isn't transgender that uses the men's room because she gets less looks from the guys than she does from the ladies.  and i know trannies that use the men's room even though they haven't had a surgery yet.  and as for post op transgenders, obviously they would use the bathroom assigned to the gender that they identify with.|`|3OZgcntfaa	I don't know where the bathroom police roam... but really its just considered a social taboo for one sex to use the other's restroom. Exceptions to this seem to be long lines at truck stops and sporting events though.<br>  <br>  People seem to have sex on the mind when it comes to segregation by sex. I'd love to know why it seems that once a person passes into a washroom they are automatically at risk of sexual assault or suddenly become rapists... What power does that doorway have that no other does??<br>  <br>  As for your trans question. People will attempt to deny anyone who is trans access to any bathrooms in public. Really and truly a trans person is going to go to the bathroom they feel most at home in. Nobody wants to be hassled, they just want to take a pee in peace.|`|OsY0lmTCaa	Males can not use female restrooms (and vice versa) because the potential for embarrassment and abuse is significantly higher.

I personally don't see how it's a problem (unless you become addicted or something).<br>  <br>  Think about it this way: would you rather have kids watch all that stuff, or actually do it? I think watching porn can be a healthy way to explore your sexuality without actually being sexuality active. <br>  <br>  But of course, everything is better in moderation.<br>  <br>  Kind of like there's nothing wrong with people who eat fast food, but if you eat it EVERY DAY, then you are probably going to get obese, have heart problems, etc.<br>  <br>  -EDIT-<br>  <br>  ginger- Yeah, but I'm also positive there are VARIOUS other factors that made him a murderer besides the fact that he watched porn.<br>  <br>  -EDIT-<br>  <br>  Okay, fast food may not have been the BEST reference, but at least you saw where I was getting at though, right? =)<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I don't get how if someone casually watches that damages someone elses life.<br>  <br>  It can if you are in a relationship with someone, and ALL you do is watch porn, but I don't see how watching it from time to time can hurt someone else. What you do in private is your business.<br>  <br>  Like I said, it's better in moderation.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't want to be an object to men... that's why I'm not going to be a porn star (or anywhere NEAR it) when I grow up! It's the woman's CHOICE to be a pornstar. If she doesn't want to be treated like an object, she shouldn't go into that profession.<br>  <br>  -EDIT-<br>  <br>  I see where you're getting at and I agree that it can cause problems, but not always. That's just my opinion, though.<br>  <br>  -EDIT (last time, I promise)-<br>  <br>  Actually, food can be a drug. People can be just as addicted to food as porn or drugs. and I would think that if you are basically killing yourself by eating so unhealthily, then it would hurt your family and friends.<br>  <br>  Sorry, done arguing about pointless crap now! =P|`|MWQF6gQIaa	Because over the generations morals have become less and less important to society. And so parents don't instill a sense of right and wrong in their kids' minds or are not even there to teach them at all.

I dont feel like there running about the shadows feeding on peoples blood or anything.  They live amongst us, some not even realizing they are vampires.  Naturally if they were truly superior to humans they be running things.  Oh but what if they are what if they control all world events, scary lol.  But really if they were as depicted in the media they would have had enough time to increase their numbers and dominate this planet using us only as food.<br>  <br>  Rather the blood line of the vampire race worldwide has been passed through generations mixing with humans and resulting in the ones here today.<br>       <br>  I myself have found that I have vampire traits.

Wish I could read minds or something though lol.<br>  <br>  There are also people who actually drink human blood.  They have donors which give them there blood.  From what I understand they do make sure there blood is disease free.  Then they pore it into a cup and drink it.  By that qualification they can be considered a vampire.  Or a human with an abnormal tendency.<br>   <br>  Dont think they are anything to fear though.|`|BuvQ8tuuaa	Vampires are not real.<br>  <br>  I have been challenging--open *daring*--vampires to find me and drain me for at least a year on this site.

That it's impossible to live without sinning, but you certainly can't kill yourself either.<br>  <br>  Essentially, what Christian religion is based on aside from the belief that it's all fictional and just a control much like how the Roman Catholic church more or less used scare tactics to receive tithing and taxes, or that people simply believe because they want to feel better about death...<br>  <br>  aside from those elements, religion and faith is about accepting that you're a sinner and praying (giving thanks for life and asking for forgiveness) so that you can be let into the gates of Heaven. For the most part you need to accept that you're human, which means that you're not perfect and live a good life as a good person.<br>  <br>  This is only the root of this discussion. I found an Online Christian Website that appears to appeal to modern society Christians:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.faithsugar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.faithsugar.com/</a><br>  <br>  I recommend checking it out and perhaps join the forum and discuss more about your feelings.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Thanks, GladToHelp

Basically it says<br>  <br>  867) The Roman Catholic Church is perfect, but not its members.<br>  882) The pope is the earthly leader of the Roman Catholic Church, and his authority over the church is absolute.<br>  <br>  You will find much the same sentiments in *most* Christian sects<br>  a) our church is correct, even though it contains sinners<br>  b) our leader(s) have authority over the church<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Eh, I don't care.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	My view is that they are correct and truth. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Catholic convert.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	i agree with user 1-2-3|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	Well, they're not particularly controversial, are they?   Everyone knows what the pope's power is over the catholic church.  And if catholics didn't believe that the church was holy and was created by god, it would be pretty pointless for them to follow it.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Yes, this is correct.<br>  <br>  To this, you can add the following:<br>  <br>  823 "The Church . . . is held, as a matter of faith, to be unfailingly holy. This is because Christ, the Son of God, who with the Father and the Spirit is hailed as 'alone holy,' loved the Church as his Bride, giving himself up for her so as to sanctify her; he joined her to himself as his body and endowed her with the gift of the Holy Spirit for the glory of God."  The Church, then, is "the holy People of God," and her members are called "saints." <br>  <br>  824 United with Christ, the Church is sanctified by him; through him and with him she becomes sanctifying. "All the activities of the Church are directed, as toward their end, to the sanctification of men in Christ and the glorification of God." It is in the Church that "the fullness of the means of salvation" has been deposited. It is in her that "by the grace of God we acquire holiness." <br>  <br>  825 "The Church on earth is endowed already with a sanctity that is real though imperfect." In her members perfect holiness is something yet to be acquired: "Strengthened by so many and such great means of salvation, all the faithful, whatever their condition or state - though each in his own way - are called by the Lord to that perfection of sanctity by which the Father himself is perfect."<br>  <br>  The Church is holy because the Church was founded by Jesus Christ as is guided and given life by the holy Spirit.  How can something that is guided by the Holy Spirit be unholy.  There may be unholy individuals in the Church, but the Church is holy because God is holy.<br>  <br>  880 When Christ instituted the Twelve, "he constituted [them] in the form of a college or permanent assembly, at the head of which he placed Peter, chosen from among them."398 Just as "by the Lord's institution, St. Peter and the rest of the apostles constitute a single apostolic college, so in like fashion the Roman Pontiff, Peter's successor, and the bishops, the successors of the apostles, are related with and united to one another."399 <br>  <br>  881 The Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock.400 "The office of binding and loosing which was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of apostles united to its head."401 This pastoral office of Peter and the other apostles belongs to the Church's very foundation and is continued by the bishops under the primacy of the Pope. <br>  <br>  The Pope is the successor of Peter, the first Pope and is responsible for guiding the entire Church while the priest is responsible for guiding his individual parish.<br>  <br>  Thank you for quoting the Catechism accurately|`|YnGIccE8aa	Ohhh look!

355JLlcLaa	I still have an interest in religions, mythology and related matters, and am fascinated that people still believe in things that to me are just not true. And finding out people's beliefs, and if possible why they have them, is part of finding out about our fellow humans.<br>  <br>  I realised in mid-teenage that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  When I first had doubts about my faith - I was Catholic - I thought that maybe this was a test of my faith. So I made the effort to accept it even more so. But the doubts came again, and I wondered what would happen if we took faith out of the equation; the world and nature still made sense, so I saw no reason to get back into it. At the time this was difficult intellectually and emotionally (I was a teenager, after all).<br>  <br>  That was getting on for 40 years ago, and my escape from faith has freed me to embrace what science has to offer, which I consider far more plausible than belief in the supernatural, and is the nearest we can get to the truth about how nature and the universe work. I've felt a sense of freedom ever since.|`|146MzXiTaa	maybe it's because christians have some kind of fetish for asking stupid questions about atheists.<br>  <br>  or maybe it's because spirituality means more than belief in a god.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	I feel they do because they are missing religion in their lives, otherwise they would only hang around other atheists|`|VLcDWWwmaa	If there were an Abortion section on Y!A, would you expect only pro-choice people to be on it and those against abortion to stay away?|`|Wr09qsYMaa	Why is there mustard on my hotdog?|`|zjyf8LvMaa	Just in time for a rum... *drink*|`|cXXJVz64aa	*drink* I'll take Diet Coke.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	such an original question i have never ever seen this one asked before<br>  <br>  *sarcasm*|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	well, someone has to answer this question<br>  <br>  *QUAFF*|`|wwdllMzYaa	you may "hate" sauercraut, but you DID just mention it<br>  and having a hatred for it IS still having an opinion on it<br>  you have that opinion i presume based on experience<br>  so its affected you<br>  so you now have formed an opinion,have some knowledge on, and knowledge to learn about saurcraut<br>  <br>  so do i about religion<br>  and i happen to be spiritual<br>  <br>   the only difference is, saurcraut is not being forced on you by saurcrout laws, or saurcraut converters<br>  if it were, i imagien youd have a bit more to say about it|`|3959c9601f288bcc65fe36767a2df0c0aa	Some atheists are religious and some are spiritual.

Anywho, this obsession the world has with super thin, unhealthy looking women is slowly changing and we have to continue to show that a "full-figured" woman does not mean "fat", it means that I am feminine, I have curves, and I am healthy.

OQdPzl15aa	I am a Christian and have often wondered the same thing. I believe God is an "equal opportunity" type of 'guy', and he said that everyone has a choice whether or not to believe in or reject him.  Since he has left us to decide where we want to spend eternity, I wonder about those who haven't heard about him.....I guess that's where missionaries come in to play, but that doesn't help those who have never been exposed to missionaries/Jesus.<br>  <br>  I believe God had a different plan for those people; whether it's showing them grace by just allowing them into Heaven, or the fact that he already knows the hearts of these people; he knows how they would react if they were presented with the choice to accept/reject him, even if they never get the opportunity to hear about him.<br>  <br>  When it all comes down to it, God judges the heart, not the actions of people, and religion really doesn't have anything to do with it.  You don't get  into heaven or form a relationship with God by accumulating brownie points through good works, going to church every Sunday or reading your Bible every 10 min.  All those are fine and well, but God is interested in a relationship with us (hence his reason for sending Jesus).  Even if these tribes don't go to church or have never picked up a Bible, God still knows their hearts. God is omniscient, therefore he knows the past and he knows what we are going to do/believe/say even before we act/think/speak. If he knows the future, he knows how the people of these tribes would react to hearing the Gospel.<br>  <br>  That's what I think, and I hope it helps!|`|wywdxhBAaa	They worship pagan gods.  Though they have no knowledge or exposure to Christ, at the end of Time will be the Great White Throne Judgment where all the nonbelievers will be given the knowledge of God and the choice to accept Christ or reject Him.

If they accept Christ, then they will have Eternal Life.|`|o4zAMlCoaa	Don't worry.

I also believe that there is only one god and everyone prays to the same one, even if they call him something different.

I came up with my own answer and I truly think that because God loves us so much, He will give that tribe in the Congo a chance because they didn't know. It is really is hard to switch religions if you've been doing something like Buddhism your whole life. God understands. You just have to think about it really hard.

If some have not heard the word of God, I am certain God takes that into consideration upon judgment day.  We, as Christians know what the Bible says about heaven, etc., but as mere humans I will not try to pass judgment to say so and so will not enter into heaven; that is the Father's job. Have you read Matt.24:14, too?  It says "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto ALL nations; and THEN shall the end come."  I like that.  Every nation will be witnessed to about Christ before the end comes.|`|70ca03b032a4b52ed809b78c85ed32e6aa	For any sect or individual spiritual advancement and realisation of God is possible only when they have complete faith on their path of belief.

He is able and willing. <br>  <br>  Nobody gets into heaven without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation.<br>  <br>  We're all sinners. Only JESUS is acceptable payment for sins. All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even one of a person's sins. <br>  <br>  Either Jesus pays for a person's sins, or that person pays for their sins in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before everyone. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!<br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|tqA9kxeqaa	It does seem kind of sad, but it is true that even the ones that never knew Christ will still never see heaven.<br>  How this is fair?

zpvOGzT6aa	In modern history:<br>  Until about 150 years ago, all Jewish  groups were Torah Observant.  There were always individuals who felt that the rules didn't apply to them, but never as a "Religious policy".  Reform Judaism started in the 1860s (or thereabouts).  The original Reform Judaism was very different from today's reform.  They felt that Torah law was archaic and had no place in modern life.  They abolished circumcision and all connection to Hebrew. Some congregations even changed Shabbat to Sunday to be more like the Christians.  The Term Orthodox was coined then to differentiate between Traditional, Torah-Observant Jews and new, non-observant Jews. Conservative Judaism was founded in America around 1930 (again, somewhere around there). They felt that Reform had strayed too far but that Orthodox was too strict.  They are somewhere in the middle. They choose certain Mitzvot and traditions to keep and others that they don't observe.<br>  It is important to remember that there are varied levels of observance among each group.  There are reform congregations in one place that are more traditional than conservative elsewhere. All Orthodox congregations hold that the Torah is divine and G-d wants us to observe His commandments.|`|p42yPCJzaa	Well it started with Abraham, but I do not think there were "sects" back then. The temples were worship based in sacrifice and that was ended with the destruction of the second temple in 70. Prior to that there was a group of people who were beginning the study of torah and prayer centered worship that we know today. I am not an expert though....|`|OzvcaJhYaa	Orthodox is the oldest|`|liJKE5B2aa	KISS|`|MPX0f5jzaa	If it was the first thing around, it can't really be called a sect.  BTW, it's not a sect, it's a movement.<br>  <br>  I guess you'd say they were Orthodox in their practices because that's the definition of Orthodox, the whole original practices.|`|AA11690436	When I tried to think of old Jewish sects, I just visualized my great uncle Joe and great aunt Rose (both in their late nineties) in bed together.  I'm not going to be able to shake that image easily.  Thanks a lot.<br>  <br>  I'm going to star your question so hopefully those more  Jewishy than I of my Jewish contacts will be able to come to your rescue.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	The different movements around today are all relatively young (young in relation to the length of time Judaism has existed).  Of those, Orthodox Judaism is the oldest, as would be acknowledged by everyone in all movements.  But every movement has origins, in an 'ideas' sense, much further back.  <br>  <br>  Judaism was always an evolving religion, and at different times in different places you can find different movements.  We are not 'sects'.  Despite differences of opinion over halacha (Jewish law), we all hold the same principles.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: the oldest branch of modern Judaism would be Orthodox.<br>  <br>  another answer is incorrect: "All of the different branches of the Jews, including the three main groups, Orthodox, Conservative, and Reformed, all claim to be the oldest group"<br>  <br>  No, Conservative and Reformed branches do NOT claim to be oldest. Of modern Judaism first was Orthodox, then Reform then Conservative then Reconstructionist|`|8I9uduIiaa	Back when the second temple still stood, there were quite a number of sects/groups within Judaism. The two most influential were possibly the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Judaism as we practise it today is perhaps most similar to the beliefs etc of the Pharisees. But there were many other groups also. A good site for info on this is <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/</a><br>  <br>  The key thing to remember is that ALL Jewish groups share the same core beliefs:<br>  - there is only one G-d<br>  - all humans are equally G-d's children<br>  - Torah is our holy text<br>  - all righteous souls reach 'heaven'<br>  - no human is ever 'divine'<br>  - G-d NEVER takes human form|`|CCzVoj2saa	I believe Orthodox is the oldest sect, but I'm not sure..

It only happens to me when I'm in a deep study of the Bible, or earnestly in prayer with singing.<br>  <br>  I'd also like to respectfully say that the Bible is very clear about the dead being asleep in Jesus until he returns.  They cannot communicate with the living.<br>  <br>  Ecl 9:5 "For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing."<br>  <br>  1Thes 4: 13-17 "But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."<br>  <br>  Any time the Bible talks about communication with the dead, it was through witches and mediums who were actually communicating with evil angels, impersonating someone who had died.|`|jG0p29Ffaa	If you feel the presence of God you'll know it and have no doubt. It's like nothing this Earth has to offer. I could only stand there crying like a baby when it was over. I will also never forget when my dad died in the hospital, he came to the foot of my bed in in our hotel room and told me that everything was going to be okay. That was before we found out that he had died that morning. I've also seen Angels on three different occasions. The last one was the one of the most bizarre things I ever saw.

One was fighting in the cause of God, and the other was ingrate. They thus saw them as twice their number with their eyes. God supports with His victory whomever He wills. In this is a lesson for those with vision.<br>  <br>  3:14 It has been adorned for people to love the desire of women, buildings, ornaments made from gold and silver, trained horses, the livestock, and fields. These are the enjoyment of the world, and with God is the best place of return.<br>  <br>  <br>  The topic of the previous verse is the fighting armies, which were almost all male. "The people" in verse 3:14 refers to adult males who are expected to draft for military service. Verse 3:14 gives a list of weaknesses in the minds of the drafted male population to join the military for defending their community. A short-term preoccupation with those blessings, ironically, could be the cause of long-term destruction and deprivation from all.

I had to put a lot in but like anything of this nature you find that just as long as you are not looking at it t say and what do I get out of it you will find you get your effort back with interest. Do not runs away with the idea that it is all camping and camp fire sing songs it is that and even more fun and challenge. It was only when I found that age had caught up with me and I could no longer camp without being ill and I could not keep up on a hike that I decided to pack it in. Admin was not my scene but I would do it all over again but I would start earlier in my life. Go to it have fun and God bless you. At one time you could not continue as a Scout leader after 65 but you can now. The CRB check applies to must voluntary work in as in any field as well as paid  professional and semi  professional work with children and vulnerable groups . It does discourage paedophiles from applying but it is not a 100% safeguard. The CRB does not take that long.|`|dKi2R2oHaa	Why so ageist?<br>  <br>  It is hardly surprising that there is a shortage of volunteers, considering the age group that you want to recruit from.

n3PiFRrdaa	Anoche tube un sueno muy loco. Mi hermano y yo fuimos a nuestro restaurante favorito.  El restaurante se llamaba "El cafe de la senora maria"  E cafe es delicioso en un dia lluvioso. Un mostro muy espantoso conosido como El Chupacabras estaba tambien en el pueblo y el cielo estaba oscuro. Cuando llegamos al restaurante, la mesera dijo, "Vienbenidos!" y nos sento en una mesa sercas de la ventana.<br>  <br>  Mi hermano miro para afuera de la ventana. El vio el Chupacabras. <br>  "escucha!", el dijo. Si, era el Chupacabras.  El chupacabras era loco y feo. Paresia una bruja.<br>  <br>  "Apurate", dijo mi hermano. Corrimos pa afuera por la puerta. Fuimos al parke. Mire a mis amigos alli con un hombre y una mujer. Las personas abian visto el chupacabras ayer. Estabamos viviendo la vida loca.<br>  <br>  Desperte. Mi sueno espantoso se avia acabado. Eso era muy importante para mi. El chupacabras era falso. O era verdad?

Those people could be free as miserable guinea pigs and slaves to ways of the very world that hates them.<br>  <br>   It is quite often noticed how the world is so screwed up. Many people want to blame that on Christianity, or even God himself. But, I think many people actually go and do the things that they accuse others for. If those things are so wrong, why do they themselves willingly do the things that they hate others for. Now, this is what Christianity is really about. It has nothing to do with eating wafers and praying the rosary. It's about believing that Jesus Christ is your savior. If that isn't a thought in someone's mind, all things become futile. And, people do complain that everything is futile. Am I missing something on this issue?<br>  <br>  And, personally I have no belief in killing societies for the greater good. Although, if those societies were so perfect, the people that belong to them would live for ever. That is the very type of hope that Christians have in Jesus Christ. And, in my personal opinion, if that hope is misplaced, there is nothing at all to have hope in. Without God, everything is worthless.|`|iHLt9Juyaa	That's a good question.

Y5FyAekkaa	Watch the movie dogma, they have a great explination for this:<br>  <br>  Basically they discuss imagining that one day you find out that you are the son of god, and you are responsible for the salvation of everyone on earth. How would u react? They think that there are missing portions of the bible because Jesus did not likely respond well. He probably spent alot of time seeking out answers from religious figures and even rebelling against what he was told.  No one wants to here that their savior almost didn't take the job!

Try the New Testament.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To answer your new question, we don't know much about Jesus's childhood. The only thing mentioned about his early life was when He went to the Temple and preached about God's word. He was 12 or 13, but other than that, He just grew up like a regular boy. That time in his life was considered more as the 'quiet life of Jesus' you could say. <br>  I mean, He wasn't ready to make himself public yet, so no one documented it.<br>  <br>  [thanks L, that'll encourage him]|`|0EkJQEV9aa	he was 33 years old when he died. in the time before he died, he was subject and obedient to his mother, then when he turned 30 He started his public life, and preched the true way to heaven, performed miracles and he died for us, all in 3 years. all that you read in the new testament, all the miracles and parables is when He was in His public life, the 3 years before he died. the only mention of his early life is when he got lost in the temple, to speak with the elders and chiefs, when his mother found him he said" did you not know that i must be about my Father's (who is in heaven) business?"<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  God BLess you|`|jURQWV6Paa	I believe he was 33.

She was in a traffic accident when her boyfriend was driving, and died.  Her boyfriend was very broken up.  Nevertheless this source never liked him, and one night while she was dreaming, she met her dead friend, who told her it wasn't an accident.

jM7CyxQzaa	The Old Ones are the ancient Gods and Goddesses that Wiccans worship. These could be from any pantheon (countries mythology) so for instance from Welsh 'Arianhrod' from Egyptian 'Ra' from Greek 'Artemis' and from Roman 'Diana'<br>  <br>  'To the Old Ones' is a general salutation to the Old Gods and is meant as a recognition of their presence.<br>  <br>  Regarding resources for learning Wicca - that depends on the kind of Wicca you mean, There is what is nicknamed 'Pop.Wicca' which is short for Popular Wicca - a kind of free for all of beliefs loosely based on Wicca outer court teachings, and there is British Traditional Wicca which is the original Wicca - ie that of  a coven and initiation based Mystery tradition training.<br>  <br>  For just starting out I'd reccomend a site called Witches Voice, from which you can find people in your local area as well as learn about Wicca and paganism in general.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your path.|`|gsWha0wTaa	probably the people who designed this?|`|jKyoKfnoaa	The Old Ones are the gods and goddesses.

S16Ge7mUaa	I don't think they are selfish. But i do disagree with them. They are people who are weak, but not selfish. and can you actually believe that suicide happens every year? every time? you just don't hear about it...n ear you or not. because it's not a great thing to talk about 'death'. When will our time come? because no one can't live forever! besides that, it's not a selfish thing, it's obviously a depressed person who has no one to love for or no one loves them, or they just can't figure them selves out, maybe their life might be great and rich or maybe they might be poor or middle class, but it doesn't change nothing. If they chose to die, they do so. It has nothing to do with being selfish.|`|a1fq8ZHBaa	Ive thought about it a maybe<br>  <br>  <br>  I will be honest i one time had those thoughts of suicide<br>  <br>  <br>  But i instantly repressed it with thoughts of my Family|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	It's not selfish- probably the people who never helped them were selfish.|`|FMwckpMbaa	No.<br>  I think no one can even begin to think about what kind of state of mind they're in at the time- unless of course, you've been there.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine ending my life, so for someone to do it- they must be going through hell.<br>  I've had a suicide in the family, and my best friend done the same thing.<br>  As awful as the consequences were for the loved ones left behind, i can't be angry about it, because i simply cannot relate.|`|T864ejaiaa	i think people who kill them self's are sick. they are so beside them self with anguish. they don't know where to go to get help. depression can do many things to to ones mind. if you ever met someone who is talking about killing them self, tell someone. try to get them help. <br>  <br>  thanks for adding me.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	NO. I think they are obviously very miserable, and wanting to escape the pain.|`|mqQUqXxNaa	Selfish?  Lol because she owns other people?|`|W0qNkROpaa	Yes, but it's not really their fault.  It's a symptom of the condition they have.  Depression makes them not able to get beyond themselves, so that everything that happens is too much for them.  It's selfish in that they're thinking of themselves rather than others, but that doesn't mean they should be thought of as bad people.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	no. not anymore selfish than other people are about things.<br>  <br>  i mean it is their life. and if they choose to kill themselves, they should be able to. i mean if anyone is being selfish its the fact that, family didnt pick up on the problems of that person.<br>  <br>  murder is a selfish act. but suicide is not.|`|wh3BAc4taa	I don't think that they're selfish. Nobody really understands what's in the mind of a depressed and suicidal person. People shouldn't make judgments or assume that a person taking one own life is selfish. And people who do make judgments about those people obviously never walked in a suicidal person's shoes before.|`|9b3537c30933da7786dc8b95599adf7daa	No I think they are profoundly discontent,sad and unhappy.<br>  <br>  We have alot of time for that in the western world to sit around being sad.<br>  Discontent is a luxury.|`|AA11503396	Yes I think they are selfish and cowards because they kill themselves just to get away from their responsibilities they heave in this world|`|K0mvCFhEaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  And tormented.|`|msVN7GBpaa	I do. they should think about the pain the left their love ones with be for they take their own life|`|M8X0dIOZaa	Do you mean selfish? A self fish sounds kinda gross... I don't like fish. Anyway, yes, suicide is selfish. Selfish means thinking or caring only about yourself. People who are depressed can only think of themselves, they are not capable of considering others in a depressed state. They are focused on how miserable they think they are or whatever it is that has them upset. People don't kill themselves because their friend is being bullied or because their friend's girlfriend broke up with him. They kill themselves because something happened or is happening to them that is causing them some kind of depression that they seek an escape from. Suicide often becomes that escape. But they are incapable of considering or caring how their death would affect their family or friends. They don't care about the suffering they inflict on others by killing themselves... they often justify the suffering if they do happen to think about it by telling themselves no one would suffer because no one really loves them... that's part of the depressed state is to think no one cares about you, or to push people away so it's easier to believe no one cares about you. It's selfish, but just because it is selfish doesn't mean you shun the person. It means you show them love even when they push you away and don't allow them to not consider how you would feel if they died.|`|pDmTRG82aa	not really. the other people are just jealous that they have to keep living a life of misery. at least people who kill themselves take their own lives and they dont have to deal with their problems anymore.<br>  <br>  besides the world is overpopulated, we need to get the population do drop somehow.<br>  <br>  the only time I would call a suicidal person sellfish is if they jump off a building and fall on a car. like they REALLY cant jump into an area that doesnt have a car? if you wanna kill yourself then hey thats your choice, but dont kill yourself in such a way where it causes problems for other people(granted it will affect your family and the people who you owe money, but I'm talking about external effects from the way the suicide is performed)|`|76f46dd025641fd70669bb4ee3f8dfebaa	So, trying to end your misery is selfish? I'm guessing it would be best to continue to suffer so everyone else would be happy. People of the world are selfish, its just something we have to accept and get over. If no one was selfish, there would be no such thing as poverty, or genocide.|`|zDJ26bktaa	Mostly, as in they don't care about the effect it would have on others. I think its taking the easy way out, unless your terminally ill and don't want to suffer, I know if I was bedridden and couldn't do anything for myself I'd rather just end it.|`|hhBQe6Jdaa	no...people who thinks people who killed themselfs are "self FISH"<br>  <br>  are selfish|`|O8pJYz5Kaa	NO WAY! People always have a reason of there on things! Maybe they or sadness or happiness!|`|5YAe0Vffaa	only if they have a responsibility to take care of someone else. otherwise, it's their life.|`|st9ah9T9aa	No not selfish. Mentally ill
zkovxRseaa	just say "i'd date someone who doesn't realize she's gay yet"|`|1BaeFYnEaa	It really might ruin it. A hetero person would really freak out at an advance from a gay friend. I've heard too many stories with the same finale.If you want to keep your friend, don't tell her you are attracted to her. I recommend you date people who you know that are gay. It's really sad to ruin a friendship like this. I am a straight person and I also pushed friends away because they hit on me: straight guys and a gay girl.<br>  Don't think of it as a bad thing. That doesn't make her any less your friend. Respect her orientation, as she does yours. If you're not sure she's hetero, let her make the first move. Or try finding out by talking about what she likes and who she dates - out of context and innocently.|`|G7a2lhvDaa	You could either say "her" but I find that many straight people find it unbelievably uncomfortable when a gay person likes them...<br>  Uhm. Try something quizical and implying her without meaning her.. such as...<br>  "Well, I would date a girl, pretty cool one, but she isn't gay, so I guess she's out of bounds.<br>  <br>  Sure that can include every straight girl in school. But even your friend will be able to realize that SHE is included in this pool of possibilities.<br>  <br>  Idk. I'm tired, and drowning in thoughts, so this is all I can offer...<br>  Maybe I'll edit later...|`|2rwU2KvPaa	If I were you, I wouldn't tell her over a text message. You need to actually tell her in person. If she isn't a lesbian, I think it might ruin your friendship, but you'll never know unless you try. Just make sure you think everything over before you do anything.

Germany is a land of culture and opportunities. The time of the "Nazis" was more than 70 years ago and the whole nightmare lasted only 12 years. There was a lot of atonement and redemption for what was caused by a fanatic clique. The modern Germans are progressive and live a life like anyone else in the world, except they may enjoy still more their "Gemuetlichkeit" and "Joy of Life" than we are used to do.<br>  Learn your German and visit the country as soon as possible to make new friends.
85c6832eec366f539d7b941dc3b61894aa	Could be worse. You could be stabbed.|`|IFQFt25naa	It sounds as though you might not be familiar with what crucifixion is, so please allow me to give a bit of a general description. <br>  <br>  - <br>  <br>  In general crucifixion spikes/nails are placed in the victim’s wrists and feet, holding the victim in place on the cross.  Then the victim is then raised into the air.<br>  <br>  When the legs are relaxed, the person's weight is supported on the bones of the wrist pressing down on spikes between the bones of the forearm.  This causes extreme pain and difficulty breathing (air can be inhaled but very difficult to exhale). When the victim can no longer endure it, he can't help trying to stand up. This tears through the tissues of his feet, and as he rises, his lacerated back scrapes along the rough wood of the cross.<br>  <br>  Hours of limitless pain, cycles of twisting, joint-rending cramps, intermittent partial asphyxiation, searing pain where tissue is torn from the victims lacerated back as they move up and down against the rough timber. <br>  <br>  Then another agony begins, the intense agony and the eventually open wounds lead to dehydration and terrible thirst.  The pleurum -- and possibly the lungs -- gradually fill with fluid, and eventually the heart is compressed.<br>   <br>  As the victim weakens, his struggles lessen, and the accumulation of fluid accelerates until finally the heart cannot beat any longer or no longer has the strength to do so.<br>  <br>  This could go on for a day or more, which is way sometimes the legs were broken to speed up death. <br>  <br>  However . . . <br>  <br>  Depending on how much extra pain they wanted to cause the person being crucified (as if general certification wasn’t painful enough) they would place the nails in different positions. (As well as positioning the body different ways.)<br>  <br>  If they just wanted to hold the person to the cross/backboard the spike/nail would be placed in the wrist. Between the bones of the wrist so that the person could not pull the nail though their wrist nor could it be ripped out (left, right, forwards or backwards) from the weight or struggling of the person.<br>  <br>  But, if they wanted to add exponentially to the suffering they would tie the arms (with rope, or something similar) to the backboard to hold the person in place, then put the nail though the palm of hand. (This is likely what was done to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.)<br>  <br>  One of the nerves in the center of the palm of our hands if it is severed causes the entire arm to feel like it is literally on fire every time it is moved or anything touches it. The really “cute part” with about doing this, the person does not pass out (lose consciousness) from the pain caused by the severed nerve. Can you even begin to imagine being on that cross, and every time you move to breath every millimeter of your arms literally feel like they have been set on fire (or that your arms have been covered in red hot coals)? In addition to everything else that was happening and all the other pain.<br>  <br>  But regardless of the method they used; crucifixion was a horribly painful, agonizingly slow way to die.<br>  <br>  There might be worse ways to die but for the amount of pain and the amount of time one has to endure before death finally comes, I am very hard pressed to think of any. <br>  <br>  And I know I cannot think of any methods of dieing/being killed that make crucifixion seem like a luxurious way to die by comparison.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Well, let's see... crucifixion procedures in the Roman Empire:<br>  First, one is flogged with whips embedded with shards of glass and metal. The flogger is expert with the whip, and tears out chucks of flesh for 39 strokes of his whip. (40 less one is supposed to be merciful).<br>  Next, in your beaten and bloodied state, you get to carry your own cross, or cross-member to the execution site.<br>  Then, you are rope-tied (or nailed, as for Jesus) to the cross-member by your wrists, and you and the wood are raised upright and mounted on a wooden post, or a tree. <br>  Initially, you hang there from your wrists until your executioners mercifully supply  a footrest to tie your feet to (or nail). <br>  Then you hang there until death comes, possible for days while bugs and birds come to feast off your body, until shock causes unconsciousness and all your blood has drained out on the ground. <br>  But for the Jews, the Romans were merciful...<br>  Jewish law required the dead to be buried before sundown. <br>  So to hasten death for burial, the executioners would come and break your legs so that you could no longer support yourself. <br>  On top of the pain from two leg fractures, the weight of your body would pull your shoulders out of joint, and and breathing would become impossible because of the strain put on the rib-cage and diaphragm. Suffocation would be the eventual cause of death in such cases.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	there is a lot worse. look up torture. <br>  ex. chinese water torture is a horrible way to die. and the romans used to put you inside a metal bull and boil you alive. yeah, there is a lot.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	the point isnt that it was the worst death, even though it was so horrible that they had to invent a word for that kind of pain- excruciating, which means from the cross.<br>  Jesus sufffered the full wrath of God for our sins|`|0EkJQEV9aa	watch the movie," The Passion of the Christ," and you will see what a horrible death, crucifixion is! the pain God undertook for us!|`|e74d7fb53114fa13fe69e5302e1bf0c4aa	It's bad, but there are worse ways to die. Being drawn and quartered would probably be worse because your intestines would have been burned on a fire while you were still alive.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	What Jesus went through is really gruesome, indeed. But there were still even more sinister and torturing deaths.|`|PCJ6zg9Jaa	crucifixion was horribly painful. I'm not sure if there are worse forms, but it is more certainly one of the more painful ones. When the spikes were driven in to the wrists, they crushed the main nerve that runs down the arm. Have you even hit your funny bone? its the same nerve, and it would have felt like someone was taking that nerve and squeezing and twisting it. pretty painful. same feeling in the feet. <br>  In the position they were hung in, the condemned person had to push up on their feet in order to exhale. This would have cause the nails in the feet to push against the nerves even more. Also, the movement would have cause the rough wood of the cross to scrape against the raw and bleeding back, because most criminals were whipped before the crucifixion. ultimately, the person would die from suffocation because they would eventually become to tired to push themselves up to breathe. Usually this took days. If the soldiers wanted to finish them off, they would break the legs so the person could no longer push up, thus hastening the death.|`|cd2etz5Raa	Do you understand exactly how crucifixions actually killed? They would nail your feet into one part of the cross, spread your arms out, and then put nails in between the two bones in your wrist. When they put the cross up it would basically suffocate you because of the way you were positioned. Each breath you took would strain your lungs more and more until you were forced to stop breathing. It would be a very slow, terrible death, but I don't doubt that there are worse, more painful and agonizing ways to die.|`|htQrkD8waa	do you know what crucifixion is?<br>  <br>  they hammer nails through your wrists and a single nail through the heels of your feet.<br>  <br>  you hang in such a manner that you will asphyxiate-<br>  <br>  hyowever the only way to prevent this is to painfully lift all your weight on that bottom nail- yup the one driven through your feet, so when you do that it is excrutiating pain-<br>  <br>  so again you asphyxiate when you relax- <br>  <br>  a strong person can last for a few days like that- but it is a slow, drawn out death.<br>  <br>  <br>  the only worse death would be bieng forced to watch dr quinn medicine woman.|`|DhoFVv4laa	Are you serious? of course there are worse.

Hanging from their hands, the victims can no longer breathe.  But to prolong the event, their feet are fixed to the cross.  This latter point is critical in that it allows them to press down on their feet and thus relieve the pressure on their chest.  Despite the agony, a man suspended with his feet fixed (especially a healthy and fit man) can survive for a least one or two days.  In fact some victims might take as much as a week to die -- from exhaustion, thirst, or blood poisoning from the nails.  As an act of mercy, the agony could be foreshortened by breaking the victim's legs or knees.  This coup de grace then caused a very rapid death, from asphyxiation of the pressure on his chest.|`|O7SshRl6aa	I have also heard that crucifixion is a horrible way to die.

EJHhCDcaaa	The Greek word for "only begotten" is monogenes, the very form of which clearly denotes "only generated." As monotheism connotes only one God and monosyllable means a word of only one syllable, so monogenes means only one genesis or only one generated--or, more simply, only begotten. It does not mean "one," or even "one and only." It is worth noting that, although Christ is called the Son, or Son of God, frequently in the New Testament, He is never (in the Greek original) called the "only" son of God. <br>  The fact is, that to call Him the only Son of God would make the Bible contradict itself, for He is not the only Son of God, and certainly not the "one and only" Son of God. Angels are several times called the sons of God (e.g., Job 38:7) since they had no fathers, being directly created by God. Likewise, Adam was called the son of God (Luke 3:38), because he was directly created. The same applies even to fallen angels (Genesis 6:2), and even to Satan (Job 1:6), because they also were created beings. The term is also used in a spiritual sense, of course, for those who have become "new creations" in Christ Jesus by faith (II Corinthians 5:17; Ephesians 2:10; etc.). In this sense, we also are "sons of God" (e.g., I John 3:2) by special creation?not physically but spiritually. <br>  But it is never applied in this sense to Christ, for He is not a created son of God (as the Jehovah's Witnesses and other cultists teach), but a begotten Son of God--in fact, the only begotten Son of God. He never had a beginning, for He was there in the beginning (John 1:1). In His prayer to the Father in the upper room, He spoke of "the glory which I had with thee before the world was" (John 17:5). <br>  In that wonderful Old Testament Christmas prophecy about His coming human birth in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), we are told that His "goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." His human body was, indeed, "brought forth" from "she which travaileth" (Micah 5:3). But long before that, He had been everlastingly going forth from "the bosom of the Father." As noted in John 1:18, He was still "in the bosom of the Father," even while He was on Earth manifesting the Father. <br>  These truths are beyond our full comprehension, of course, for they are all part of the great mystery of the Tri-une Godhead. Christ is "the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15), for as He said: "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30). <br>  Eternally Begotten <br>  He is not just the only begotten Son of the Father, for He is also the eternally begotten Son of the Father. He is eternally "in His bosom," yet always "going forth" to "declare" the Father--once as the creating Word, occasionally in pre-incarnate theophanies, also through the Holy Spirit conveying God's written Word (which had been "eternally settled in heaven" [Psalm 119:89]) down to man through divinely chosen prophets, then ultimately appearing as the incarnate Word to live forever as the God/man. <br>  The doctrine of "eternal generation" was what the older theologians called this great truth. He did not become the only Son by His virgin birth. He was the only begotten Son from eternity, "set up from everlasting" (Proverbs 8:23). <br>  The First Begotten from the Dead <br>  But that is not all. He was not just the only begotten Son in the beginning, He soon also became the "first begotten of the dead" in time (Revelation 1:5). He was "declared to be the Son of God with power, by the resurrection from the dead" (Romans 1:4). When Paul at Antioch preached on the resurrection, he declared that God "hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee" (Acts 13:33).<br>  He is the only begotten Son eternally and now the first begotten Son by resurrection, "the first fruits of them that slept" (I Corinthians 15:20). What a wonderful Savior is Jesus Christ, our Lord! <br>  The Lord Jesus is not only the unique Son of God by eternal generation and by resurrection, but also by divine inheritance. God has "spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things" (Hebrews 1:2).|`|NWa45ZDIaa	Nina, I know you don't like the "copy/pasted" type of answers, but I would have a hard time explaining this myself, so I'm copying & pasting the article link titled: "What Does the Bible Say About God and Jesus?" & one excerpt from the subcategory: "How the "Only-Begotten Son"?" It DOES answer your question so if you want the answer, please read the article & notice the citations from theologians & Catholic encyclopedias, etc., as well as the many Scriptures: <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/article_05.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/article_0...</a><br>  <br>  Here's the excerpt:<br>  "THE Bible calls Jesus the "only-begotten Son" of God. (John 1:14; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9) Trinitarians say that since God is eternal, so the Son of God is eternal. But how can a person be a son and at the same time be as old as his father?... The basic Greek word for "only-begotten" used for Jesus and Isaac is mo·no·ge·nes', from mo'nos, meaning "only," and gi'no·mai, a root word meaning "to generate," "to become (come into being)," states Strong's Exhaustive Concordance. Hence, mo·no·ge·nes' is defined as: "Only born, only begotten, i.e. an only child."—A Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament, by E. Robinson.<br>  <br>  The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, edited by Gerhard Kittel, says: "[Mo·no·ge·nes'] means 'of sole descent,' i.e., without brothers or sisters." This book also states that at John 1:18; 3:16, 18; and 1 John 4:9, "the relation of Jesus is not just compared to that of an only child to its father. It is the relation of the only-begotten to the Father."<br>  <br>  So Jesus, the only-begotten Son, had a beginning to his life. And Almighty God can rightly be called his Begetter, or Father, in the same sense that an earthly father, like Abraham, begets a son. (Hebrews 11:17) Hence, when the Bible speaks of God as the "Father" of Jesus, it means what it says—that they are two separate individuals. God is the senior. Jesus is the junior—in time, position, power, and knowledge.<br>  <br>  When one considers that Jesus was not the only spirit son of God created in heaven, it becomes evident why the term "only-begotten Son" was used in his case. Countless other created spirit beings, angels, are also called "sons of God," in the same sense that Adam was, because their life-force originated with Jehovah God, the Fountain, or Source, of life. (Job 38:7; Psalm 36:9; Luke 3:38) But these were all created through the "only-begotten Son," who was the only one directly begotten by God.—Colossians 1:15-17.|`|BCOmoJ59aa	The phrase “only begotten Son” occurs in John 3:16, which reads in the King James Version as, "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." The phrase "only begotten" translates the Greek word monogenes. This word is variously translated into English as "only," "one and only," and "only begotten." <br>  <br>  It's this last phrase ("only begotten" used in the KJV, NASB and the NKJV) that causes problems. False teachers have latched onto this phrase to try to prove their false teaching that Jesus Christ isn't God; i.e., that Jesus isn't equal in essence to God as the Second Person of the Trinity. They see the word "begotten" and say that Jesus is a created being because only someone who had a beginning in time can be "begotten." What this fails to note is that "begotten" is an English translation of a Greek word. As such, we have to look at the original meaning of the Greek word, not transfer English meanings into the text.<br>  <br>  So what does monogenes mean? According to the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (BAGD, 3rd Edition), monogenes has two primary definitions. The first definition is "pertaining to being the only one of its kind within a specific relationship." This is the meaning attached to its use in Hebrews 11:17 when the writer refers to Isaac as Abraham's "only begotten son." Abraham had more than one son, but Isaac was the only son he had by Sarah and the only son of the covenant. <br>  <br>  The second definition is "pertaining to being the only one of its kind or class, unique in kind." This is the meaning that is implied in John 3:16. In fact, John is the only New Testament writer who uses this word in reference to Jesus (see John 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). John was primarily concerned with demonstrating that Jesus was the Son of God (John 20:31), and he uses this word to highlight Jesus as uniquely God's Son—sharing the same divine nature as God—as opposed to believers who are God's sons and daughters through faith.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that terms such as "Father" and "Son," that are descriptive of God and Jesus, are human terms used to help us understand the relationship between the different Persons of the Trinity. If you can understand the relationship between a human father and a human son, then you can understand, in part, the relationship between the First and Second Persons of the Trinity. The analogy breaks down if you try to take it too far and teach, as some Christian cults (such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses), that Jesus was literally "begotten" as in “produced” or “created” by God the Father.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	?

DIlNnjf8aa	"O son of Adam, as long as you call upon Me and put your hope in Me, I have forgiven you for what you have done and I do not mind. O son of Adam, if your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you would seek My forgiveness, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, if you were to come to Me with sins that are close to filling the earth and then you would meet Me without ascribing any partners with Me, I would certainly bring to you forgiveness close to filling it."<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  The question is worded in reverse of what it should be. Love by Allah SWT is there for the asking and the receiving; the eternal losers are only those who continuously reject Allah's love.<br>  <br>  Another Hadith Qudsi:<br>  <br>      On the authority of Abu Harayrah (ra), who said that the Prophet (saws) said: Allah the Almighty said:<br>  <br>     "I am as My servant thinks I am.  I am with him when he makes mention of Me.  If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in an assembly better than it.  And if he draws near to Me an arm’s length, I draw near to him a fathom’s length.  And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed." (Bukhari, Muslim, Tirhmidhi, Ibn-Majah, Imam Nawawi’s 40 hadith qudsi) <br>  <br>  And another Hadith Qudsi:<br>  <br>  On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:<br>  <br>  "A man sinned greatly against himself, and when death came to him he charged his sons, saying: When I have died, burn me, then crush me and scatter [my ashes] into the sea, for, by Allah, if my Lord takes possession of me, He will punish me in a manner in which He has punished no one [else]. So they did that to him. Then He said to the earth: Produce what you have taken-and there he was! And He said to him: What induced you to do what you did? He said: Being afraid of You, O my Lord (or he said: Being frightened of You) and because of that He forgave him."<br>  <br>  It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah).<br>  <br>  Another Hadith Qudsi:<br>  <br>  A man killed 99 people and asked a monk "will Allah forgive me?". He answered no so he killed the monk. This man went to another monk and asked him, "will Allah forgive me?" and he told him to go to a man to seek forgiveness. On his way to this man, he died. The Angels of Punishment and The Angels of Mercy came to take his soul. The Angels asked Allah which one of us shall take his soul? Allah told them to measure the distance he travelled. If the distance he walked was longer than the distance left to his destination, then the Angels of Mercy will take his soul, but if not, then the Angels of Punishment would take it. Because of Allah's Mercy, Allah extended the road that he travelled. When the Angels measured the distance, the Angels of Mercy took his soul and he was admitted to Paradise.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Muslim's god is not the same Holy God that the Christians worship.|`|b1yr0KDEaa	Christians teach that God's love is NOT unconditional... billions of people will go to Hell because they didn't worship Christ as their savior, according to them. God's love - in the Christian scheme - is dependent on obedience and correct belief. If sending people to Hell is "love", then I guess Hitler musta really loved the Jews!!!|`|E07VAMNMaa	I am not sure christians believe gods love is unconditional. the quran states, 'allah loves not the disbeliever' I cant remember the surah. <br>  But it seems that every religion believes god only loves its own believers lol. Quite convenient for them.|`|WapXyZwUaa	if god's love is unconditional no one would go to hell, unless god is evil and allows people he loves to be tortured in a place that god created for that specific purpose...that already happens on earth|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"I think Muslims do believe god's love is unconditional"|`|6hfRXDqcaa	if you mean that God should unconditionally love people who molesses child, despise the needy, make life harder for other etc... thats a real good question. <br>  <br>  i think God unconditionally loves and He is so just that He does not forgive you if you abuse others "personal rights": He leaves this decision to you to forgive or not the people who abused your personal rights. and He says it is better for you to forgive and rewards you if you forgive, but still choice is in your hands. see how much He loves you?..<br>  <br>  (i am disagreeing with the idea of: "if god's love is unconditional no one would go to hell" --> even going to hell shows this love for me. Because think of that: you caused many people (maybe only one person) to suffer so much with your doings that it is only after you go through such punishment people (person) may forgive you because you found what you deserve. then you can go to heaven after your punishment is complete. according to my knowledge of islam belief only people who go to hell permanently are the ones who associates others with God in any kind of worship. <br>  this is called "shirk": ascribing a partner or rival to God. <br>  But "sincere!" repentance wipes out every sin, without exception.|`|mQsAUjHXaa	We believe God is the Most Merciful, that's probably His most stressed attribute.<br>  <br>  His love IS unconditional...as you can see from reading the quote from bloggers (which i believe is in the Quran, if not then it was revealed to the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) from God..so its God's words).<br>  <br>  As long as you don't give Allah's "right" of worship to anything/anyone/any Deity away then you have his Mercy and Love. Worshiping other gods or deities with Allah, or worshiping them other than Allah is the only unforgivable sin..that is the only sin that will land you in Hell without SINCERE repentance and immediate change.|`|rIvp1BToaa	no  they  believe  in Allah  who See's them as no more than ants.   this is  what I have  been told  by a Muslim  ''why  would  you want to serve  God  as god  does not  need or care  for us.''<br>  <br>  Islam teaches  you must  earn your way   to paradise and one  way is  by  convert others  or killing none believers.|`|Nzw6sHKeaa	Allah is the same God worshipped by Jews and Christians.

Stick with a charismatic nondenom church... learn who the Holy Spirit is, He's the greatest!!! Its not about lighting candles and hail mary's its about a genuine relationship with Jesus!  He is full of grace and love for you and from what I've learned of Him, he's not a big fan of religious crap and rules made up by man!|`|HjPxEupWaa	I hope and pray that you can see the light from the other side someday, just to see it, like i did... <a href="http://www.davidmacd.com/catholic/index2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidmacd.com/catholic/index2...</a>|`|oaEqLAT7aa	I love being Catholic! I love it because I am close with God and I get to witness the greatest Miracle of all time... at Mass when the bread and wine is transformed into Jesus' Body and Blood. In fact I get to see that at least twice a week! That gets me going for my day too. <br>  <br>  I ask for God's help all the time. Also I ask for Mary's and saints help a lot. Which I do when praying, praying the Rosary, at Mass, whenever. Like asking for a friends help on something.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's ok for a Catholic to join a nondenominational Christian Bible study. Because many other Christian groups think what we learn and know (which has been handed down in 2000 years tradition) is false. They might teach about Catholic teachings being false.<br>  <br>  Also you can't be 'border line Catholic" You either are Catholic or you are not. Don't mean to offend but it's a fact. There is no "gray area"|`|AuCnM6Qoaa	Buy the 'American Standard Bible' and join the local catholic inquiry class conducted at most catholic churches in your area.<br>  The main thing about being a catholic is Jesus in my body after deceiving Him in Holy Communion. The fact that the second person of the blessed trinity is here for me is overwhelming. Jesus speaks through me, my hands are His hands, I see through His eyes. Jesus lives in me.<br>  Jesus' mother is a blessed virgin, Jesus was born of her and she shared in every joy and sorrow that Jesus experienced, that's why she is a Redeemer of us all. She has given us the rosary where we review the bible stories that are important to her, we meditate on her life with Jesus. The million saints of the catholic are there to answer our prayers, and to inspire us to live good catholic lives.|`|PZKmZ95Yaa	You have a lot to learn and some growing up to do.<br>  <br>  As Fr. Joseph has said, we pray for you and that you are freed from your spirit of contention.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Being a catholic means being in God's will.  Christ, after founding the Catholic Church, made it clear that there was to be only ONE Church.  When He expressed His divine will "that they all may be ONE", He was saying "that they all may be Catholic", since there was no other Church He could have been referring.  If you know your faith well (no offense but it doesn't sound like you do), there wouldn't be any harm attending a Protestant Bible study, but you should realize that you will not be hearing what the Bible actually says, only what they think it says.|`|31M2IDw2aa	There is NOTHING more important to me than to be able to worship our Lord Jesus Christ in the Church that HE established on the rock of Peter.  When one realizes that the Catholic Church IS the body of Christ himself, words can't describe the awesome beauty and truth contained in the Church.  When you learn what the Sacraments are, and participate in them, ESPECIALLY the Holy Eucharist, you realize that you ARE with Jesus.  What could be more important than that?<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church means everything to me, because Jesus Christ means everything to me.  <br>  <br>  I STRONGLY advise you to get a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and read it.  It has the potential to change you for all eternity.  Peace.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Being Catholic is not only how we Worship but is also a way of life. I'm a convert to the True Church and it is one of the most satisfying things i've ever done as the Catholic faith is not only a feel good life but one of obedience in preparation to meet our Lord and Savior.As for Mary and the Saints try thinking this way it is knowing you have some one helping you to know Christ better and are there ready to assist you.As for going to non Denominational Bible studies it is really not advisable as they will not understand it with the knowledge of the Church and will only confuse you.Almost every one Catholic who thought they were showing the ecumenical Spirit by attending such gatherings quickly learned they taught anti Catholic beliefs and usually attempt to convert them.So unless your well founded in Catholic teachings and our understanding of the Bible best to avoid.As far as bibles go the St.Ignatius Bible is the one i believe the Priest and Bishops prefer. And last we as Catholics have no doubts about our faith and that is even with all the immoral behavior of Priest in the Past as we look at it as a attack on the Church by Satan's influence.|`|AA10192697	How can you go to both? Do you receive Communion in the Catholic church? You need to be Baptized and have received your first Reconciliation and first communion in order to receive the Holy Eucharist and all that comes with it.  If you do without being a Catholic, you are living in sin and sin each you do receive it. And a Catholic can't receive Communion with moral sin on their soul. They need to receive the Blessede Sacrament of Reconciliation before going to Communion.  Attending Mass with all your heart and soul washes away your venial sins, which we commit almost daily.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what the rules are in a Protestant Church for services.<br>  <br>  I'm catholic and love it beyond anything. I'm not the best Catholic. I have my questions, my times that I wonder about things, my days that I don't pray like I should, my moments of swearing and such. But I'm trying to be better. I want to live in Heaven with my Lord.  I feel very close to God. He is the one that saved me from myself yrs ago after I overdosed.  I rarely pray to Mary or saints. St. Dymphna is my patron saint. I have prayer cards for them but usually just talk to them as if they were old friends sitting in the room with me.  I pray to God. I talk to Him like He is my father. Asking for help, guidance, a kick in the butt, for thanksgiving, questions. etc.<br>  <br>  I read and study from the NAB, New American Bible. The footnotes are great. I also use an Bible Dictionary and Concordance and the Catechism of the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Honestly, though, you can't be both. They have different traditions, authority of the Blessed Sacraments that Jesus gave to the 12 Apostles, authority of the Church, a pope, etc.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	You started out lying about your practice and after you solicited for our testimonies you admitted you deceived us.

"<br>  <br>  "I will choose the person who says to go to a nondenominational church for best answer"<br>  <br>  "I <3 Catholics, they don't bother me (unless when they say the Virgin Mary or a saint said to then....)..." <br>  <br>  Sad.... that you had to say this about Catholics. I see that your non-denomination church is teaching you so well.<br>  Good luck to you in your non-denomination church.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly, every denomination, non-denomination, and cell group thinks they are the most accurate manifestation of Christ's Body on earth. <br>   Denominations have been splitting off for 500 years since the original Reformation split. By the time of Martin Luther's death there were already 280 denominations that had split off of his original slit with the Church. <br>  <br>  So disagreements are common.<br>   It's not necessary to agree with each other before we pray together and prayer is an important step toward unity. <br>  We are all Christians. <br>  <br>  True faith requires obedience, humility, and childlike simplicity; it excludes pride, self-will, clinging to our own ideas, and that unwillingness to obey which hurled the angels from heaven, and cast our first parents out of Paradise. Faith is a duty which God requires of us, and unless we fulfill this duty sincerely, we can never enter the kingdom of Heaven.  One may say: "To submit to the yoke of faith is to submit to spiritual and moral tyranny; it is to lose one's liberty." There is liberty, and there is license. To be the slave of vile passions, and seek to satisfy them always, and at any cost, is not true liberty. Surely God is free. But God cannot sin. It is, therefore, no mark of liberty to be under the power of sin; on the contrary, it is the very brand of slavery. The power of sin implies the possibility of becoming a slave of sin and the devil. Those, then, who are greatly under the power of sin, and so go to hell, cannot truly be called free men. They are blinded and brutalized by satisfying the promptings of their brute nature, and thus renounce their glorious freedom, to sell it for a bestial gratification.|`|AA10920670	I love being Catholic. It means I am part of a global family. I can go to mass anywhere, even in a different language, and know what's going on. The lives of the saints are very enriching to my faith. They had the same faults, dreams and joys I do. <br>  <br>  I am a bible JUNKIE. I have a ton of bibles. Even variations of the same bible. NAB, DV, JB, GNT (Cath), RSV (Cath) NLT (Cath), Peshitta (Syriac Bible).<br>  <br>  It's important to find one that you can read easily. One that speaks to you. The Douay Rheims has a concordance, or you can buy a separate book with full text of each item. But it's reading level is pretty high. <br>  <br>  Most folks buy a missal for daily readings. You might try a subscription to Magnificat Magazine. It's a tiny publication with daily readings, morning and evening prayer.<br>  <br>  For a long time I attended services at a Presbyterian Church after mass. Just because I enjoyed their services. I had a friend who did the same thing in another city. But she was unable to compartmentalize and gradually bad beliefs crept in. So there is a danger there. <br>  <br>  Try Jeff Cavin's bible studies. They are fantastic!|`|Bqoydq1Oaa	I love being Catholic, because it is the truth, and the Church Jesus established (Matt 16:18). I haven't been able to find anything unbiblical about Catholicism, and I feel that God has led me to the Church. Everything in the faith comes from what Jesus handed down to His apostles, contrary to man made traditions such as sola scriptura, which never made sense to me when I was a Catholic-in-denial. <br>   I didn't always believe Catholic teachings, and I struggled a lot. But now I understand the Catholic teachings better.<br>  <br>  Also, Catholics have the Sacraments, and Jesus is really present in the Eucharist-- so I do feel close to God. Heaven touches earth during mass.<br>  Some people condemn symbols and rituals, but our entire culture is based on rituals. Rituals have a deep meaning to them. Symbols alone are useless, but with their deeper religious meaning, they help us connect with God. God is transcendent, so symbols and sacraments help us become closer to God.<br>  Of course, there are still tough times that I experience, and I still struggle.<br>  The saints and Mary are great examples on how to live my life and follow God. I pray with them and ask them for their prayers all the time, and they bring me closer to God. They led holy lives and inspire me to be more faithful when walking with God<br>  <br>  Yes, I think its fine to join a non denominational Christian Bible study, as long as I understand the Catholic faith well enough to know that we don't agree on everything. I have been part of several non denominational bible studies and learned a lot there. Not all Christians may agree on everything, but we had a lot to learn from each other. Of course, if the bible study teaches everything strongly contrary to Catholicism, then I would probably have to stay away. I have been to bible studies with anti Catholics and sometimes it really hurt. <br>  A Bible I really like is the RSV-CE. A Catholic study Bible would be good for what you're looking for...and RSV is the version that I recommend.<br>  <br>  It's fine to go to other church services, but if you are Catholic, you should be going to mass every Sunday and not receive communion at other churches. Also, Sacraments are important, so if you haven't received Communion or Reconciliation or Confirmation yet, it's a good idea to. <br>  God bless :)|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Being Catholic means being part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ Himself.  I love the privilege of being in the presence of the Lord at Mass, and witnessing the miracle of transubstantiation, where the Holy Spirit changes bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Our Lord.  I also like attending Eucharistic adoration.  I consider being able to spend time with the risen Christ a much greater honor than if I were invited to have dinner with the pope. I definitely feel close to God while at Mass or Eucharistic adoration.<br>  <br>  I like praying to saints, especially Mary. She is our most powerful intercessor, and can pray to God much more effectively than we ever could ourselves.  The more one honors her, the more will she obtain blessings for that person.<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/rosary/how_to.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13.

When you say you are "Borderline Catholic" does that mean you have actually received the sacraments? Baptism, Reconciliation, First Holy Communion, followed by Communion weekly on the day of obligation, Confirmation, Holy Matrimony, and possibly Anointing of the Sick? (I am taking a guess Holy Orders is out) <br>  <br>  When you say you use some of the Catholic "things" does that mean you are taking communion? FYI: if you haven't received the first four Sacraments and you are an adult you shouldn't be receiving communion in the Catholic church. <br>  <br>  I know some of my fellow Catholics have really good links to catholic study bibles with the additional seven books contained. Hopefully they'll link you. <br>  <br>  It's OK to go to protestant bible studies, as they are pretty much using the same bible (save for the seven books) and the translations are very close. However, as Catholics we are discouraged from attending other services unless it's for a special occasion such as a wedding, baby dedication or a funeral. They don't participate in the Eucharist, and that is why. <br>  <br>  If you are considering becoming a Catholic from a protestant denomination you are more than welcome to come to our masses while still attending yours. We also encourage you to join the next RCIA class in your local parish. You don't have to become Catholic, it's a period of inquiry. <br>  <br>  As for your first question: yes, I do feel very close to God. I feel very comfortable and strong in my faith. I feel the presence of the Holy Spirit at Mass. Being Catholic means that I belong to a worldwide church, where every day people all over the world are hearing the same bible and Gospel readings as I am. They are also participating in the Holy Eucharist. I like the fact that matters of faith and how scripture and tradition applies to today's society isn't just determined by one man reading a bible, but by a group of the world's most brilliant theologians, whom with Divine Inspiration proclaim meaning to todays issues. That the Pope also is in consult, and I trust when he makes a statement, it is right, and is what God wants us to hear. <br>  <br>  Regarding Saints and Mary, while I keep defending our faith on this one, I like the idea that there are humans in Heaven, sinners just as we are, who can also hear our prayers, our petitions, and rally on our behalf. It's one thing to ask your friends to pray for you here on earth, it's quite another to ask your friends who are in heaven to do it. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you'll clarify.|`|zFhhgL0Oaa	being catholic is the religon handed down by jesus, protestant is a man made form  of catholic beliefs, made to their likings and they dont believe evrything a catholic does so they made their interpretation of it. protestent DO NOT celebrate the body and blood of jesus in mass every time. catholics receive the body and blood of jesus every mass. protestants have a problem with mary and saints. the rosary given to us by mary is meditating on the four gospels of jesus life, and if you can tell me whats not  to like about that? saints are people who have been touched by jesus and received graces by him, so we ask certain saints and mary to help us be closer to jesus, and certain saints do have the power through jesus to grant graces from jesus. thats how they became saints is by doing these miracles i think at least three to be considered a saint.catholics believe confessing sins to a priest is the only way, and jesus said that to the deciples whatever sins you forgive are forgiven those you dont forgive are still sin on your soul.. good luck hon in your journey

It's all good.
FcZU29W6aa	We used to go to a cafeteria chain and it was pretty good.  I loved it as a child because I could get what I wanted and could see it before I decided to try it. Once, at a very nice restaurant, my brother ordered swordfish, which surprised us all, and he was very disappointed it didn't come with a sword!<br>  <br>  My grandson likes to go to our local buffet restaurant -- he was such a picky eater, and when we first went there, he was willing to try just about every thing because he could take a very small portion (less than one bite) to try something.|`|KWwW7N49aa	We did.  It was fun.  I was always looking at the desserts and trying to decide which one to select.  I still prefer cafeteria-style.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	We rarely ate out but when we did, it was at a family style restaurant. I can see why it was such a treat for you to eat at a Cafeteria, since you could select the food items yourself. Great memories huh?<br>  <br>  edit: Go to the question where the guy asks if it took us 50 years to find the name of a song. I left a comment for you when I answered that question.|`|CkKlZFVmaa	They have a huge cafeteria at  Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park.   I think we ate there every time we drove through the park.   Other than school cafeterias that is the only one I've been in.   Thanks for the memories|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Rarely, when we were on a trip.  There weren't any, in our town.|`|AA11598520	Rarely. There weren't many around here.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	We didn't have any in our area and rarely ate out. A couple times we drove about 40 miles to a church-sponsored "smorgasboard" that was held in a restaurant, it was like going to a potluck and we thought it was something else. We all ate way too much and laughed about it for a few days afterwards. I didn't visit a cafeteria until about 29 years ago, when my daughter was a few weeks old. I couldn't have imagined when I was a child all of the the buffet restaurants that are so common today.|`|86b78f4627ad46a2ab99f65751b68309aa	I remember a few when I was young, I couldn't see the food and my mom would choose what I would be eating.  We had a smoke house my mom favored so we ate smoke chicken and ribs when we ate out.  I still love it today.  By the time I was a teen the fast food world was the norm so the cafeteria was for the oldies.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	No, my Father hated cafeteria's. We were not really wealthy but when we went out to eat, it was to the finest restaurants with the best food. When we went on vacation it was to the finest resort or we didn't go and we went to a lot of fine resorts. When he went out of town my sisters and I begged my Mom to take us to McDonald's and she would only do so if we promised never to tell Dad and we never did.|`|AA11616170	No, we rarely ate out, and places to go were few and far between. We ate at home, and in summer brought picnics with us to the park or to the beach.  Even having a picnic in the back garden was a treat,  and 25 years later my children enjoyed the very same.|`|AA11017231	We seldom went to a restaurant and there were no cafeterias in our area, not even in the school until I was in, I think the sixth grade. And I didn't like eating that slop even in school.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	I used to go to a cafeteria in the basement of a 9 story department store with my Grandmother. If was fun being allowed to choose whatever you wanted|`|AA11767291	Yes but it was usually when we were on vacation or going some place new.  We didn't have cafeterias in our neighborhood. It wasn't until high-school that I experienced cafeterias regularly.|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Yes, to Frankie's Cafeteria and the Magnolia|`|01a19d2b8982bebcfca1b5520fa5d1e1aa	Yes.

The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

Or even why he was able to pass on his talent to the disciples. <br>  <br>  BTW, a lot of the gnostic texts were outlawed by the pope in the 5th century. This was done to keep power within the church. So there is a lot we do not know about the story Jesus that we could've known.

69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I'm an atheist.  I also had these questions.  I used to be a Christian.  I finally came to believe that none of it is true and there is no God.  If there is no God, then there can be no other supernatural beings.  If there are no other supernatural beings, then I no longer have to be afraid of Hell because there is no devil.  I no longer have to be afraid of being haunted because there are no ghosts.  I know longer have to wonder why my Guardian Angel doesn't save me from harm, because there are no angels.  It's very freeing.  It's as painful at first as finding out there is no Santa Claus, but the truth will set you free.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	You shouldn't have to worry about such details.  There simply is no empirical evidence for any deities.|`|fSAPBW28aa	I completely agree with #1. There are millions of religions in the world, how do we know that ours is the right one?|`|jBYxEX8taa	1) In my opinion, Christianity feels like the right choice to me, and I feel close to God as a Christian. I don't agree with many of the things said in the other religions. For example, the Quran.<br>  <br>  2) Maybe the people working at the restaurant aren't Christian? They could be atheists, or part of another religion. If they are Christian, then they should have a right to object to working on the Sabbath. They should be able to tell their boss that it's against their religion. All beliefs and non-beliefs should be respected in, and out of the work place.<br>  <br>  3) Maybe you just didn't have enough faith, and weren't asking sincerely. It can happen that you were only asking God to be in yur heart to see if He's there, not to get close to Him and love Him. Pray to God and read His Word. Be sincere in your heart and He will answer you. <br>  <br>  4) God mentions the stars in the bible. I see it as God didn't need to tell anyone about a universe. Knowing about the universe wont help us in our relationship with God. It is basically irrelevant. God has given us enough information to believe in Him, and that is all we need. The bible has the answers when read thoroughly. I'd recommend a Life Application Study Bible. <br>  <br>  5) Well, the word "heaven" can also mean "sky". I think it basically meant God created heaven - that which is above; the sky, clouds, stars, etc. There are many ways to look at it. <br>  <br>  6) After satan is defeated, all are cast into the lake of fire; satan, his demons, and all the souls that were in hell. It says I think in Revelations that "the smoke will rise from the lake of fire in the presence of the lamb and the angels". I would say God will control it. <br>  <br>  Just my opinions - hope it helps.|`|5y38Pdtiaa	the bible is a fiction book|`|0YQRbq9faa	Those are all valid and thoughtful questions.  I was raised Southern Baptist also for many years.  However, I did not come to know the Lord until my family left the southern baptists and began attending a Bible-believing, Bible preaching church when I was in my teens.<br>  <br>  However, let's look at those questions with Bible answers.<br>  <br>  1.  Jesus said I am the way, the truth and the life, no man comes to the Father except though me - John 14:6.  That is an exclusive statement to truth.  He is claiming to be the only way to God.  If you believe Him, and that He is truthful, you must reject other "religious and spiritual paths" as being invalid.  The choice is yours.<br>  <br>  2.  The Sabbath is a concept for the Jews not Christians.  The Sabbath rest was enjoined in the 10 commandments on the Jewish people.  Jesus repeated all the commandments in His teaching during His earthly ministry except one - Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy.  It was not commanded to Christians.  However, the 10 commandments are a reflection of God's Holy nature and character. Christians are wise if they follow the 10 commandments as guides in life.  I personally take Friday off from the work of ministry and do nothing but rest and read.  It is an invaluable contribution to my physicaly and mental and emotional health to give one day to God in rest.<br>  <br>  3.  The Bible is clear that we need to receive Christ as our personal savior.  I was saved at the age of 16 when we started attending a Bible believing church.  I am sorry to say it but Southern Baptists do not preach the gospel.  They do not evangelize.  They do not lead others to Christ, at least the church we attended did not.  I would have been saved years ago, but no one every witnessed to me or shared the Bible truths of salvation with me in over 16 years of attending a Southern Baptist church from the week I was born an in the nursery to when we left when I was a teenager.  You need to repent or be willing to change your mind about your sins, realize you need Christ as your personal savior, then invite Him into your heart and life by simple, genuine honest prayer to forgive your sins and save your soul.  Meditate over the following verses: Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23; 2 Corinthians 5:21; John 3:16; 1 John 2:1-2; Revelation 3:20; John 5:24.<br>  <br>  4.  There have been astronomers gazing into the heavens for thousands of years.  Early civilizations could see the moon, the stars, and see a large night sky filled up with the wonders of the universe.  Many of the early pagan cultures even worshipped the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars.  They know there was a large universe beyond their planet, they just did not know how emmense it is as we do with large telescopes.<br>  <br>  5.  No. God created the universe of expansive space with the sun, moon and stars, the angels, and he made the earth at that time also.  It means God made the entire expanse of the universe.<br>  <br>  6.  Hell is a dark place of intense heat and suffering. I would assume the devil will try to rule hell if there is anyone that can focus on following him in a dark place of intense heat.  I heard a Pastor ask this questions the other day.  How do we know that there will be light in hell?  We assume that because there is intense heat there and flames that the flames will give off light.  What if hell is completely dark like in the middle of a cave where there is not light whatsoever and your eyes freak out because there is not source of light to help them adjust.  Hell might very well be a place of intense heat and flames that give no light.  So people who reject Christ as their personal savior from sin spend eternity in hell - a pitch black place of intense heat and suffering - read Luke 16 in the story Jesus tells about the rich atheist and Lazarus.  Hell is a place of unthinkable torment.  Receive the Lord as your personal savior and you will never have to worry about going to hell - John 5:24 "he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life."<br>  <br>  Blessings on you as you wrestle through these questions about life.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	1. If god is real then why does every religion think the other ones are wrong? that does not seem to be the christian thing to do.<br>  <br>  All religions do that. This is one of the major things that make me question religion is because if on the offchance that one was right, only ONE would be right and Christianity has no more chance to be right then any other one.<br>  <br>  2. Why do people go out to eat after church where a restaurant full of people that are forced to work on the sabbath? does not seem right.<br>  <br>  Just a good old friendly meal with friends lol don't see anything wrong with that.<br>  <br>  3. Why has god never made me feel like he was in my heart when I asked him to be?<br>  <br>  The simplest answer is usually the best. Because there is no God.<br>  <br>  4. If people did not know there was a universe then why didn't god tell them in the bible?<br>  <br>  See number 3.<br>  <br>  5. Why is it that the bible starts in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. The word heavens comes from a word meaning clouds. Doesn't that mean a man just said what he saw which was the clouds and the earth?<br>  <br>  Possible.<br>  <br>  6.if your soul goes to heaven or hell who is going to rule the people in hell when god beats the devil at the end of time?<br>  <br>  Again, there is no God. But hypothetically, I don't know. Just another plot hole I suppose.<br>  <br>  Do not let anyone on here give you a hard time for your views. Do what you want to.|`|AA10471679	Fair enough.<br>  <br>  1) This question seems to be based on two assumptions.  First, that God can't be real if someone disagrees with me about who He is.  If I believe that Washington DC is the capitol of the United States, and someone else says they'd prefer it be Chicago, that doesn't render my belief invalid.  Second, I'm guessing you believe "the Christian thing to do" in all cases is to get along with and never disagree with anyone.  People hated Jesus.  They tried to kill Him numerous times before they finally got Him.  Perhaps "the Christian thing to do" would have been for Him to stop ticking people off and for Him to be more tolerant of their beliefs.  He chose not to.<br>  <br>  2) Well, you forgot gas station attendants, people who work in the media, hospitals, grocery stores, public utilities, cops and firemen, etc.  All of them have to work on Sundays, and quite a number of them would prefer to have that day off.  (The fact that some would use their day off by shopping or going to a sports event or to an amusement park with their families is beside the point?)  Would we be better off shutting down the economy on Sundays?  Probably.<br>  <br>  3)  My favorite t-v preacher once asked in a sermon if his congregation ever woke up in the morning and didn't feel married.  They felt married yesterday, felt married last week, but today it just didnt "feel like" it.  It begs the question:  What do your feelings have to do with what's real?  I don't feel right now like I have blue eyes.  But they're there.<br>  <br>  4)  Of what importance is the universe?  Right now, I'm taking a break from studying bone remodeling, and the piezoelectric effect and how it might be used to speed the healing of broken bones.  I'm not real upset with God for not including that in the Bible even though it'll be on my exam in a few weeks, and "the universe" won't be.  Also recall that both the universe and the skeletal system will pass away.  The Bible's pretty good about taking about the things that matter and will last.<br>  <br>  5) Are you absolutely certain you have the correct understanding of the Hebrew words "shamayim" and "erets?"  And are you certain the focus of the verse is what was created as opposed to Who created?<br>  <br>  6)  The devil has already been defeated.  The jail in question probably won't need a jailer, but I would imagine the Angels would do well.<br>  <br>  Ready for some honesty?  I think most of your question is a waste.  Your central issue seems to revolve around #3:  "God, I don't feel like You're there."|`|Bi1W5U35aa	You were a spirit child of God (Host of Heaven) and came to earth to be tested. Satan and a third of the Hosts are the testers.The Lord set up his Church with Apostles and Prophets, but they were rejected  and so the church died. LDS are not supposed to eat out or buy on Sunday or work. Be of service to someone and you will feel his spirit. Heaven is where God dwells. Christ revealed the laws we must live by and paid for the sins of those who would repent, but the rest would have to pay for their own sins and receive a lesser kingdom at judgment day, but all would be saved and He would give God the glory. Satan wanted to force obedience and be above  God and take the glory. (momon.org)|`|GHdscZ2Haa	1.  Because man makes God in his own image.   People want to worship the God that supports their preconceptions and their thoughts and bigotry.<br>  <br>  2.  Apparently we can work on the sabbath now.   Just don't ask where Jesus actually says this.   But Paul says it is O.K. Just ignore the fact that he never met Jesus except in his dreams. (Highly verifiable!)<br>  <br>  3.  Because <br>  a) he does not like you<br>  b) you never begged him (prayed) hard enough.<br>  c) because he is imaginary.<br>  <br>  (If in doubt, just pick c)<br>  <br>  4.  Because he had to give it to them in terms that they understood.  Apparently the people who wrote the bible were really thick and not capable of the understanding that we have today.<br>  <br>  5.  Because it is a mixture of creation myths.   Do not expect it to be rational or consistent.<br>  <br>  6.  God.  God does it now.   God is omnipotent (allegedly) Satan is not.   So there is nothing that Satan can do that God can not stop or reverse.   So anything that Satan does has the tacit approval of God and must be what God wants to happen.    Supposedly the all loving God has chosen not to ever forgive some people and wants them to suffer infinite punishment.  Because he loves them so much.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	I'm surprised it's so short given you are a Southern Baptist. <br>  <br>  Of course you can question God. How else are you going to find anything out about him. Trust me God can be help up to scruitiny and if questions were never asked Christians wouldn't have spent the last 2000 years exploring the nature of God and our relationship to him. <br>   <br>  1. Tolerance is the Christian thing to do. <br>  Part of fundamentalists thinking is the belief in the correctness of their thinking which excludes others practices, beliefs and faith.<br>  <br>  2. Not all denominations of all religions place a high priority on doctrinal conformity. So the Sabbath is cultural - in a busy modern society not everyone can or believe they have to rest on the Sabbath.<br>  <br>  3. God was in your heart. Not everyday can feel like a giant love affair with God. Even the most pious like Mother Theresea said  'as for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great, that I look and do not see, — Listen and do not hear — the tongue moves [in prayer] but does not speak ...

The Bible never mentions a Hell of eternal damnation. It's a scare tactic various churches have used throughout time. If God is a loving father and we are his children - what kind of father would throw is child into a fiery pit to burn forever for the slightest infraction with a big Red Devil reigning supreme. Why would anyone want to believe in such a nasty God. A diety so cruel that if he were a man he would be no better than a dictator that should be tried for Crimes against humanity.<br>  <br>  Many devout people believe in the private nature of spiritual belief, the unity of peoples, forgiveness of wrongs, helping the poor etc.<br>  <br>  This site is a good reference for various Christian beliefs and traditions. <br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/christ.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/christ...</a><br>  I|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Good questions.  <br>  <br>  First, I've got to tell you that I was raised in a Southern Baptist church (several, actually, as we moved a lot) and went through the same questioning you did, researched the answers, studied my Bible, and came through it all with a much better sense of who God is and why we're here.<br>  <br>  1.  It's not the religions that think the others are wrong, it's the tenets of the religions that say so.  Hinduism believes that hey, whatever you believe, you're a Hindu.  Islam says that you must believe in Allah, and you must do good works.  Those beliefs simply aren't compatible.  In the case of Christians, it was Jesus who taught two unique messages -- first, that God loves us all and wants that none of us should perish, and two, that God has made it easy for us to get forgiveness, by reaching out to us and providing a way, without us having to earn anything.  In fact, Jesus taught that earning our way to Heaven was unfair, because some could do better than others, and have a right to brag about it.<br>  <br>  2.  I'm not sure I understand the significance of this question.  I think you're trying to apply the 10 Commandments to Christians.  First, the 10 Commandments were directed to the Jewish people, never to Christians.  Jesus' standards are actually much tougher to meet.  But second, the commandment was to remember the Sabbath, to keep it holy.  That doesn't say that one can't work or spend or eat or do anything else.  It was Pharisitical Jews who took that command and made specific legalistic rules about what constituted work and what didn't (one sect even prevented adherents from going to the latrine on the Sabbath!)  Didn't Jesus teach that we're not to be legalistic, but are to be tolerant and loving?<br>  <br>  3.  Feeling is transient.  It depends on your mood, your diet, your exercise level, your hormone balance, etc.  You can't find me a place in scripture where Jesus tells us to follow him and we'll FEEL alright.  Don't rely on your feelings.  Rely on fact.  The fact is that Jesus promised that if we trusted in Him, our sins would be forgiven, that all of Heaven would rejoice, that we would be with him in paradise.  Sitting here now, I don't FEEL saved, but I know by Christ's promise that I am saved.  That's a big difference.<br>  <br>  4.  This just isn't a logical question.  If God knew there were cells, why didn't He tell them?  If God knew there were polar bears, why isn't that in the Bible?  We can't evaluate scripture based upon what it doesn't contain, as that's an unreasonable standard.<br>  <br>  But in fact, there is more about the Universe in scripture than any other aspect of creation.  Repeatedly, scripture says that God has spread out (past tense) and is spreading out (present tense) the heavens.  Not all that long ago, when science said the Universe was unchanging and static, scripture said that it had a definite beginning and was in the process of stretching out.  Discoveries by Edwin Hubble and Albert Einstein changed the scientific view, and proved that the Universe had a definite beginning and is spreading out.  This is now the most verified bit of science ever.  And the Bible's description had it right all along, in terms that no one had the ability to full appreciate until science caught up.  I don't know about you, but I think that's amazingly cool!<br>  <br>  5.  No, I don't think it means that a man just wrote what he saw.  For some reason, we tend to think that humans in those days were stupid.  In many subjects they were smarter than we are; one of those was astronomy and the movement of the planets.  Ancient people were certainly very aware of the movements of the heavens.<br>  <br>  But I think your issue is one of translation.  The word "heaven" can be used to represent many things.  In this case, in the context of the creation story, I think it means the cosmos, the Universe, everything outside of the earth, and not a specific place where God resides.<br>  <br>  6.  It's a common theme in comic strips that the devil is in hell torturing humans who were bad.  I don't think that scripture paints that picture at all.  This is a complex subject for which there are different theories, but it's clear that hell is a place of torture, of separation from God and all that is good.  C.S. Lewis illustrates hell as a lonely, frightening, desolate place in his excellent work "The Problem of Pain."<br>  <br>  The book of Job (and others) indicate that Satan is currently able to return to Heaven to the presence of God, and that he also walks the earth, looking for who he may tempt (though from the context, this appears to be an oversimplification.)  <br>  <br>  Revelation tells us that hell and death and Satan will ultimately be burned in the Lake of Fire, which is different than hell or sheol.  Satan won't have subjects to torture; he will be impotent himself.<br>  <br>  Great questions ... keep 'em coming.  I wholeheartedly encourage you to explore these types of things.  No one advocates a blind faith.|`|B7DE2As9aa	I would love to answer these question for you, and any others you may have, but I don't the space here or the time at the moment to respond to all that.  If you send me an e-mail giving me permission to e-mail you with answers, I'll be happy to take the time to do it.  I don't mind.|`|0vDC99t0aa	because not every one has the same bible the king james is the real bible  i don't know the second one. he is there if you really asked him.<br>  but you have to be serious. ok god did tell them in the bible mine anyway. heaven is above the cloud's its not the cloud's. god sent the en evilto hell he is going to rule the unsaved . if your saved by god you go to heaven if not you go to hell and god loves you and me very much and the devil hates you and everyone else|`|IkOHh5X8aa	1.Because in the Bible it says  that people would turn away from the truth listenig to doctrines of demons and teachings of devils.Thats how the devil makes people believe all this nonsence.<br>  <br>  2.The sabbath was abolished. Read about in Matthew and Mark.<br>  <br>  3.Too personal,read the bible to find out<br>  <br>  4 Because God gave us the free will to discover the universe if we wanted it to.<br>  5.Again I say to you you have FALLEN AWAY FROM THE TRUTH. Thats a scientific thing about the clouds, you got to trust in your creator for answers.<br>  6.No one will, the devil will be suffering there with all of those who have not accepted Christ in their lives.|`|YtlwiO2laa	1. Different religions will always have arguments. look at the muslim and hinduism. idk how that has anything to do with the belief of God.<br>  <br>  2. ive gone to church my whole life. never had looked at people working on the sabbath as a bad thing. that type of rule is from the old testement. we go by the new testement.<br>  <br>  3.the feeling of him in your hear? well, that you have to answer yourself. honestly did you mean it when you confessed your sins and asked him to be your Lord and Savior? <br>  <br>  4.haha that has nothing to do with a belief in God. who cares why he didnt. maybe he wanted someone to try, think, and discover themselves.<br>  <br>  5. no, this is something called faith. lol and no heavens do not mean clouds. in fact no one knows how heaven is actually going to be.<br>  <br>  6. There is going to be torture. .... period. sadly. i suggest you read 23 minutes in hell for this one. its good and short. <br>  hope this helps.|`|vCO7eygCaa	1. If god is real then why does every religion think the other ones are wrong? that does not seem to be the christian thing to do. All religion has one belief in common, there is a God, they just have different ideals on what is right and what is wrong, what you have to do to go to heaven.<br>  <br>  2. Why do people go out to eat after church where a restaurant full of people that are forced to work on the sabbath? does not seem right.I think that people gets tyhe sabbath and the seventh day of the week confused,  In the bible there is a passage where Jesus said: if your oxen fell into a ditch on the sabbath would you not get it out, not and exact quote, Jesus and his disciples gather food on the sabbath to eat, He also said the sabbath was made for you and not you for the sabbath. I do agree if it is a wrong for you to work on the sabbath is would be a wrong to make someone else work.  The bible does not tell us we would go the Hell if we work on the sabbath.  Again it is the belief not nessary a wrong doing.<br>  <br>  3. Why has god never made me feel like he was in my heart when I asked him to be? I believe that before you can feel God, he must be in you heart, I also believe before he comes into your heart he must be asking to come in.  I don't believe that he will come in unless he is asking,  When he is asking you will feel him, your heart will hear him.  I spend a lot of years asking him to come in, That is the way I was tought in Church, but now I know that he does not come in until he is ready and you will feel his present at that time and you will know it is him.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. If people did not know there was a universe then why didn't god tell them in the bible? I think the people knew it, it is just not in the bible,  I don't think the bible tell everything.  People has always had question about creation, I beleive they asked about it.  <br>  <br>  5. Why is it that the bible starts in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. The word heavens comes from a word meaning clouds. Doesn't that mean a man just said what he saw which was the clouds and the earth?  Since the bible is a translation from another language, there might not have been an English word meaning the same as the word that was translated into heaven or earth.  They used what they thought was the best describution to the world that was used.<br>  <br>  6.if your soul goes to heaven or hell who is going to rule the people in hell when god beats the devil at the end of time? That is a very good question.  Why would there need to be a ruler, there will only be pain,  Someone in pain will not be able to listen to any ruler, he/she will only be thinking about his/herself.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	1) Because religion was invented by man to control the masses & to cheat people out of money. Why wouldn't you say other religions are long so they convert to yours if you're gaining power?<br>  <br>  2) They pick and choose what to believe and take seriously from the bible. (but to be fair, it says they can't work on Sunday, not that they can't get food from people that does work on Sunday)<br>  <br>  3) God doesn't exist<br>  <br>  4) God doesn't exist<br>  <br>  5) Man wrote the bible...<br>  <br>  6) There is no soul, heaven or hell. They're just things made up to scare people into believing in their religion.|`|AA11297267	1. You're right.  If there really was a god and christ, you'd think they would have left a clear, concise history and set of rules needed to get into heaven -- not the mess of 34,000 different christian sects arguing about the meaning of the bible.<br>  <br>  2. They're hypocrites.  You'll find a lot of that with christians.<br>  <br>  3. Because there is no god -- bravo for figuring that out despite your upbringing!<br>  <br>  4. Yep.  And why do they get everything else wrong, like the age of the earth, how life evolved, how languages came to be, etc.?  You'd think people supposedly "inspired of god" to write would get things correct -- but they rarely do.<br>  <br>  5. What the bible means by "heavens" is clear from the tower of babel story -- where men were building a tower that god decided could "reach up to heaven."  The writers of the bible believed "heaven" was just a little above earth, in the clouds -- and in the old testament, that's where they said god lived.  We've been there now...no gods.<br>  <br>  6. Isn't it funny how made-up stories aren't self-consistent? :)<br>  <br>  You're on the right track.  Keep thinking and using your brain.  You'll find there's no evidence of any god and no evidence that the bible has any kind of "truth" in it -- and plenty of evidence to show that it's all just made-up fairy tales.  <br>  <br>  Peace.

q802CQnAaa	Regardless of the age, people who enter relationships lying about something make me nervous, personally. If he lied about that, what else is keeping from (or will keep) from your friend. Its never a good way to start something out. It would have been different and more innocent if he came clean a day later, but not three weeks. The age difference is big, especially for the young guy to be 19. It would be different if one was 40 and the other 55. The maturity level difference between 19 and 34 is immense.  Just be there for your bud, he'll be back soon.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Calm down.  He is not a pedophile.  He was deceived.  This happens all the time in relationships.

This works both ways. They care for each other, else they wouldn't be together. My lover of four years is 30 years younger than I am. Many young men WANT to be with an older man. My man cares for me and loves me. That is what any man should expect of his partner. As long as that is what is happening, let them enjoy what they have and be happy for BOTH of them, not just your friend.<br>  As far as his deceit about his age, the young man may have been worried that your friend wouldn't want to be with him if he revealed his actual age. I think his lie was relatively harmless. I've seen this many times before.<br>  Get to know the young man a little better. This will help you understand why your friend is with him.<br>  Auntie Kookoo|`|MuRzzoq3aa	hi,hey theirs nothing wrong with that at all hell ,i know lots of guys that are haveing sex with alot of older guys ,it not wrong to have someone you like ,so what if they are older then you ,it just that they like each other cause they feel good about them selfs, so u should not be that way ,hell i know 30 guys that are with young guys an they are from the ages of 18-65 ,an they seem to enjoy each other ,so if they enjoy themself why should u knock it ,try some one older your self an see what it feels like, then you will know what its like to have an older man , just don't judge some one with out knowing what is it all about ,bye 4 now|`|150ffcb711824f9fc3252407402a28adaa	Frankly, same what you think. It's just wrong - it sounds wrong, looks wrong and damn it, why do those kids have to lie about their age?

In most states, once you're eighteen, you're an adult and can do whatever (or whoever) you want. In some states, you're a consenting adult anywhere from 14 to 16 years of age.<br>  <br>  Really, it's none of your business. If they are happy, then unless you want to lose a friend you need to just back off and let them be. If one of them was getting abused or something and asked you for help, that's one thing... but sticking your nose in their love life just because it freaks YOU out? Unacceptable.<br>  <br>  And for the record... a person is only a pedophile if they have an attraction to pre-pubescent children (usually 11 years old and younger). :/ No matter how old someone is, if the person they are dating has hit puberty, the person isn't a pedophile. And ephebophile (someone who is attracted to teenagers), maybe, but that's a whole different story.<br>  <br>  If they're mutually consenting, happy and all that, then good for them. But again, it's not my business, and it's not your business either.

zZxX5PXBaa	Nennius is an important early source for events that probably have some historical basis.<br>  <br>  There is a collection of Welsh stories, the Mabinogion, which clearly contributes something, but mainly to the mythic dimension. The earliest texts are much later than Arthur's time, but the stories are reckoned to have existed in oral tradition from much earlier, and oral traditions are now appreciated as allowing very accurate transmission.<br>  <br>  Many of the Irish (and Scottish) Heroic Age tales are roughly contemporary with Arthur, and they have so many parallels with Arthurian stories that it is hard to believe the influences weren't strong in both directions from an early age. There is an obvious parallel between Ferdia and Cuchullain's fight to the death at the ford, for instance, and traditional stories of the death of Arthur and Mordred. Similarly Fraoch's death parallels Arthur's fight with the dragon in some versions of his Brittany escapades; though of course, Arthur survives. For some reason, Arthurian studies largely ignore the Irish legends.<br>  <br>  The strongest source, however, which is textual and contemporary with Arthur, is Gildas. Gildas is a bad-tempered Christian monk. His 'Excidium Britanniae' (The Downfall of Britain) is a substantial critique of the kings of Arthur's time, and describes in detail a world exactly corresponding to that which Arthur is presumed to have emerged in. Arthur is not mentioned by name, but he may be mentioned in a cryptic way, and several passages are tantalisingly close to describing an 'Arthurian' figure. <br>  <br>  If you look at standard Arthurian studies you'll see references to many sources, the Annales Cambriae, Geoffrey of Monmouth, and so on. There is now a sort of standard 'canon' of early texts, bringing the stories up to the mediaeval period. It's very easy to neglect earlier sources, such as the Anglo Saxon Chronicle, which have somehow been marginalised from this canon, but they do tend, like Gildas, to confirm the traditional picture of the world in which Arthur, if he existed, lived. Many of them make fascinating reading and are a help in understanding how weird that world was, and how different to our own.<br>  <br>  Likewise, there are other traditions across Europe which, like the Irish stories, have clearly influenced or been influenced by the Arthurian legend as it has developed, so the Norse myths (Siegried and co. Baldur ...) and the Viking Sagas (the story of Burnt Njal) all contribute elements, and in later times there are overlaps with other British legends, such as Robin Hood. In many cases there are fragments of historical information, but hardly ever anything that you can connect with a historical document close to Arthur's time.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Tales about King Arthur were mainly written down a few hundred years after they were meant to have happened.  <br>  <br>  Current opinion is that any historical person was a Romano British soldier, of aristocratic status, who led fighting against invaders.  <br>  <br>  Stories, after Gerald of Wales in the 1100s, were often written in France, where troubadours and courtly love prevailed amongst the royals and aristocrats. Stories were popular, became more elaborate and had lother characters and events added on.  <br>  <br>  It is a lovely legend, but may owe much to several real heores and some older dieties as well as everyone's craving for a good story.|`|x1LmS9vTaa	It's a combination.  It's believed that King Arthur is based on several kings in England (way back when it was called Britannia).  Book 4 of "Historia Brittonum" by Nennius, written around 850 A.D., is about a warlord named Arthur, and lists his battles.<br>  <br>  The section about Arthur starts in section # 50, about 3/4 of the way down.

9jo37B3saa	Dear sister,<br>  <br>  Modesty is a virtue which Islam demands of Muslim men and women. The most powerful verses commanding the believers to be modest occur in Surah al-Nur and begin with the words:<br>  <br>  "Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that will make for greater purity for them: and Allah is well aware of what they do." <br>  [Noble Quran 24:30]<br>  <br>  The rule of modesty is equally applicable to men and women. A brazen stare by a man at a woman or another man is a breach of correct behavior. However it is on account of the difference between men and women in nature, temperament, and social life, that a greater amount of veiling is required for women than for men, especially in the matter of dress. A complete code of modesty is laid down in the Quran as follows:<br>  <br>  "And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; and that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty save to their husbands, or their fathers or their husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their brothers or or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss.<br>  [Noble Quran 24:31]<br>  <br>  When a woman wears perfume, the ruling depends on the situation: <br>  <br>  1 - Using perfume for the husband. <br>  <br>  This is mustahabb and recommended, because it is part of treating him kindly, and it helps to increase love between the spouses, when each of them pays attention to what the other likes.<br>  <br>  2 –  Putting on perfume and going out with the aim of letting non-mahram men smell it. This is haraam, and is a major sin. <br>  <br>  It was narrated from Abu Moosa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “If a woman puts on perfume and passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance, then she is such and such,” and he spoke sternly - meaning an adulteress (In Metaphorical Sense). Narrated by Abu Dawood (4173) and al-Tirmidhi (2786); classed as saheeh by Ibn Daqeeq al-Eid in al-Iqtiraah (126) and by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.<br>  <br>  3 - If she puts on perfume and goes out, and thinks it most likely that she will pass by a group in which there will be men who will smell her perfume and fragrance, this is also haraam, even if she does not intend to tempt men and that is not her aim, because this action is a fitnah (temptation) in and of itself. There is also an indication in sharee’ah that it is haraam and not allowed.<br>  <br>  It was narrated that Zaynab, the wife of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood, said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said to us: “If one of you attends the mosque, let her not put on perfume.” Narrated by Muslim (443). <br>  <br>  If the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade women to go out to the mosque wearing perfume, because men will usually smell some of the fragrance because of close proximity and there being no barrier between men and woman, then it is more likely that women are not allowed to go out to the marketplace and gatherings wearing perfume, although it is not regarded as a major sin, rather it is something that is clearly haraam.<br>  <br>  4 - When she puts on perfume and thinks it most likely that her fragrance will not reach people and that men will not smell any of it, such as if she is going out in her husband’s car on a trip to an isolated place, or to visit her family, or she is going out in her husband’s car to a gathering for women only, or she is going to the mosque in the car and she is going to get out at the entrance to the prayer-hall that is for women only and is completely separate  from the men, then she is going to come straight back in the car without walking in the street, and other such situations where the woman does not expect to pass through the streets and her aim in putting on perfume is to keep herself clean in general as enjoined by sharee’ah. In that case there is nothing wrong with her using perfume, because the reason for the prohibition, which is that the fragrance might reach other men, does not apply. <br>  <br>  If an emergency arises in which some men happen to smell the perfume of this woman, because of a car accident, for example, or a sudden illness because of which she is taken to the hospital and the like, then this is something that is forgiven, in sha Allah, because Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope and the shar’i ruling is to be followed in cases where one has the choice, not in cases of necessity.<br>  <br>  If you did not know that before, ask Allah to forgive you and He will forgive you, in Sha Allah. <br>  <br>  And Allah knows best.|`|XIwR89ejaa	Allah swt is the most merciful and forgiving.<br>  <br>  There are wisdom behind why walking around with perfume in the presence of men is haram. We need to look at the effects of perfume on the human senses.<br>  <br>  Wearing a nice perfume can act as an aroma therapy and enhance a persons mood or recall a pleasant memory.<br>  <br>  Perfume is sensual and thus can create positive human reactions.<br>  <br>  The scent wafts around you causing others nearby to smell and appreciate the sensual experience. <br>  <br>  When scents are inhaled, messages are sent to the brain. Some scents trigger old memories and feelings. Others prompt chemicals to be released that cause emotions and desires to surface. The effects can include relaxation, lowered inhibitions, heightened sensitivity, and feelings of euphoria. These sensual reactions can even promote physical arousal.<br>  <br>  Scents have powerful sensual and alluring connotations. <br>  <br>  The Scents of Seduction <br>  <a href="http://ontherecordmag.wordpress.com/2008/08/13/the-scents-of-seduction-2/" rel="nofollow">http://ontherecordmag.wordpress.com/2008...</a>|`|BVVvb8Ieaa	MUhammed K: You sound like a Javanese person....<br>  I'll bet anything on it....are ya?<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: Why are you thumbing me down?

(Mishkaat<br>  Hadith4443)<br>  2.

These clergymen who arrogated themselves and falsely claimed to be the "ulama" (people of knowledge), polluted the message of islam with ignorance. They fabricated numerous sharias (laws), prohibitions, veils, beards, turbans, rules on how to clean one's bottom, rules on how to pee in the bathroom, toothbrushes, right hands, left hands, right feet, left feet, hadiths, sunnas, intercession, holy hair, holy clothes, holy teeth, holy feet traces, hazrats, lords, saints, mawlas, mahdies, innocent emams, orders, sects, rosaries, amulets, dreams, holy loopholes, prayer caps, circumcisions, shrines, extra prayers, extra prohibitions, and numerous Arabic jargon such as mandup, mustahap, makruh, sharif, sayyid and more nonsense. Thus, the religion of Sunnis and Shiites contradicts the divine laws in nature and scripture, and condemns its sincere followers to misery and backwardness. The religious leaders and their political allies contribute greatly to the backwardness of the Muslim world. God Almighty now wants to reform us and open the path of progress with the message described as "one of the greatest" (74:30-37). Similar distortion and corruption was inflicted upon the system of islam (submission to God in peace) by professional religious leaders. For instance, soon after Jesus, a Pharisee-son-of-Pharisee who claimed to have seen Jesus in his vision, started preaching in the name of Jesus. His passionate, yet diabolic doctrine was rejected by the monotheists and muslims, but a majority of people were duped with his delusional passion and clever salesman skills. As a result, he made major changes, including transforming monotheism into polytheism to the extend of coining the name Christian (Acts 11:26). Jesus never silenced women and put them down with xenophobic teachings but St. Paul asked women to submit to men and hush: (1 Timothy 2:7-15; 1 Corinthians 14:34-35; 1 Peter 3:7). Jesus never asked for money for preaching but St. Paul asked for money shamelessly and likened his audience to a flock of sheep to be milked by the holy shepherd! (1 Corinthians 9:7). He was a master of deceit as opposed to Jesus who did not twist the truth to gain followers; Paul made up anything he deemed helpful to increase the number of his milk-giving flock (1 Corinthians 9:22). See 9:31; 33:67. Also, see 2:59; 3:45,51-52-52,55; 4:11,157,171; 5:13-15,72-79; 7:162; 19:36.

Compare it to how blacks and whites were in the 1800's and 1950's-60's and yes we have a great relationship. In general, we're working on it. It's improved very much though. All that's standing in the way is ignorance.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	The relationship is good on the outside due to political correctness but inside most blacks and whites have a disliking for each other.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Ha ha!  <br>  <br>  *cough* No *cough*<br>  <br>  I mean, it could be better.  <br>  <br>  I would like for it to be better, actually, but there are too many narrow-minded people on both sides to get anything to work.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	in reality we cooler than a fan. i dont work with white folk so maybe my incidence of racism is bound to be minimal.<br>  <br>  i have had my occasional share of getting stopped by the popo while driving but nothing major yet. i havent had my butt whooped yet hehe. i wish a motherlover would<br>  <br>  i dont go to white restaurants cuz i dont know if the waiter is racist. i dont want nobody shittiing in my food.<br>  <br>  all in all we cooler dan a fan|`|KKeLsvyGaa	Nope.

I was with a girl whose family hated me, she had personal problems as well, and i spent more than 2 years trying to help her get away from her problems. I was so sure she could make more of herself than she had originally been and I stayed with her. Although I've loved her for 3 years now, we've been together for almost a year next month.<br>  <br>  At one point she lied to me too and it hurt me, no matter how small it was i felt sorta betrayed. I had spent so much time trying to get us perfect and I felt like she didn't open up to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  I let her back in my life and even now shesz trying to prove her loyalty to me. I can say its easier than it was but you'll still question things. I think that you just need to be ready to get back together and make sure she is too because walkin into the difficult situation unaware of the proble will only further the issue.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't give up on her though, just give her her space.

LQQAQDkIaa	I pray the liturgy of the hours with my copy of Christian prayer. We as Catholics have been doing this for centuries. More centuries than MTs. denomination has been around, I'm sure. You should have gotten a guide with it that gives you date, and Saints and tells you where to begin the 4 week psalter. Of course, you can simply jump in where ever you like and begin to pray, but with the guide to Christian prayer, you will be in synch with other Catholics all around the world. Pax Christi|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Go to tangle.com and put in liturgy of the hours.  There is a guy on there who explains how to pray it....It's titled introduction to the Liturgy of the hours<br>  <br>  Mt - It is not heathen to read from the book of hours...they are psalms, readings, and prayers.   It is a devotional book, the same kind of devotional book that any other individual reads from.   There are devotional bibles and devotional books...anything that brings one into closer relationship with Jesus is not heathen|`|AA10920670	There are many versions. Liturgy of the Hours, Christian Prayer. If yo picked up the William Story set, that will be difficult because it is an "unofficial" version. You're kind of on your own.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to learn is to find a local monastery with public prayer. Many churches have returned to public "Laudes and Vespers" which is morning and evening prayer. So check your parishes too. They most often use "Shorter Christian Prayer" as it is a single very small book. Or the even smaller version "Morning and Evening Prayer."<br>  <br>  I was lucky enough to have some local Benedictines with public Laudes and Vespers. Diocesan priests are all required to pray the hours. But most of them are far too busy to educate a person.<br>  <br>  It also helps to purchase the "guide" depending on which book you have. I have the 4 book version. There is a single book marked "Christian Prayer" which does not have the Office of Readings.<br>  <br>  Basically, there is the "Psalter" - which is the Book of Psalms broken into a 4 week set of prayers. And the "Proper of Seasons."  The "Order"  -  a small section between the two larger sections, will tell you what part you need and when. There is also a "Proper of Saints."

While many other religions have so many requirements and rules that they must follow to merit their gods love, or their going to be with their god when they die. They must always earn their gods love or work at keeping it. <br>  <br>  Grace simply stated, is God giving us a free gift that we do not deserve. It is His loving kindness to us, for it is grace, because it is given without regard to worth or merit. <br>  <br>  The awesome thing is that we cannot do anything to make God love us any less or any more. We don't have to be successful to be loved. We don't have to fulfill certain obligations to be loved. We don't have to do good works to be loved. We are loved by God through grace, because we cannot do anything to earn His love. Why? Because we are already pleasing to Him once we receive Christ's forgiveness of sin. In other words, grace says you can't earn it, I give it. It says you've failed, that's all right, I am here to help you AND THAT'S ALWAYS WORTH SINGING ABOUT!|`|sr3l6pgsaa	Because they always remember Grace Kelly?:-))D<br>  (folks,i know what Amazing Grace is,c'mon...it's just my sense of humour is spontaneous,sorry,didn't mean to offend anyone)adios.|`|b0f24d67ec4d38818e50b7ee63133822aa	It's a good song.

Many scholars have recognised that the Jewish nation (God's people at that time who held God's word) were a nation who as far as hygiene practices were concerned, were well ahead of their counterpart nations about them. Even some of the health practices that were displayed and written in the Bible have only been recognised by society as a whole in our later centuries.<br>  * You hear it on here all the time and it is really stupid, but people are saying the since the people of Christianity (after the Catholicism corruption) say the world is flat and proof has shown over-wise, that it does not give the Bible any credence.

Py6lBb31aa	First of all, please don't look at the answers on here that are pointing you away from the Church. They haven't got 2000 years of history behind their back. <br>  <br>  Becoming Catholic is one of life’s most profound and joyous experiences. Some are blessed enough to receive this great gift while they are infants, and, over time, they recognize the enormous grace that has been bestowed on them. Others enter the Catholic fold when they are older children or adults. This tract examines the joyful process by which one becomes a Catholic. <br>  <br>  A person is brought into full communion with the Catholic Church through reception of the three sacraments of Christian initiation—baptism, confirmation, and the holy Eucharist—but the process by which one becomes a Catholic can take different forms. <br>  <br>  A person who is baptized in the Catholic Church becomes a Catholic at that moment. One’s initiation is deepened by confirmation and the Eucharist, but one becomes a Catholic at baptism. This is true for children who are baptized Catholic (and receive the other two sacraments later) and for adults who are baptized, confirmed, and receive the Eucharist at the same time. <br>  <br>  Those who have been validly baptized outside the Church become Catholics by making a profession of the Catholic faith and being formally received into the Church. This is normally followed immediately by confirmation and the Eucharist. <br>  <br>  Before a person is ready to be received into the Church, whether by baptism or by profession of faith, preparation is necessary. The amount and form of this preparation depends on the individual’s circumstance. The most basic division in the kind of preparation needed is between those who are unbaptized and those who have already become Christian through baptism in another church. <br>  <br>  For adults and children who have reached the age of reason (age seven), entrance into the Church is governed by the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA), sometimes called the Order of Christian Initiation for Adults (OCIA). <br>  <br>    <br>  Preparation for the Unbaptized<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Preparation for reception into the Church begins with the inquiry stage, in which the unbaptized person begins to learn about the Catholic faith and begins to decide whether to embrace it. <br>  <br>  The first formal step to Catholicism begins with the rite of reception into the order of catechumens, in which the unbaptized express their desire and intention to become Christians. "Catechumen" is a term the early Christians used to refer to those preparing to be baptized and become Christians. <br>  <br>  The period of the catechumenate varies depending on how much the catechumen has learned and how ready he feels to take the step of becoming a Christian. However, the catechumenate often lasts less than a year. <br>  <br>  The catechumenate’s purpose is to provide the catechumens with a thorough background in Christian teaching. "A thoroughly comprehensive catechesis on the truths of Catholic doctrine and moral life, aided by approved catechetical texts, is to be provided during the period of the catechumenate" (U.S. Conference of Bishops, National Statutes for the Catechumenate, Nov. 11, 1986). The catechumenate also is intended to give the catechumens the opportunity to reflect upon and become firm in their desire to become Catholic, and to show that they are ready to take this serious and joyful step (cf. Luke 14:27–33; 2 Pet. 2:20–22). <br>  <br>  The second formal step is taken with the rite of election, in which the catechumens’ names are written in a book of those who will receive the sacraments of initiation. At the rite of election, the catechumen again expresses the desire and intention to become a Christian, and the Church judges that the catechumen is ready to take this step. Normally, the rite of election occurs on the first Sunday of Lent, the forty-day period of preparation for Easter. <br>  <br>  After the rite of election, the candidates undergo a period of more intense reflection, purification, and enlightenment, in which they deepen their commitment to repentance and conversion. During this period the catechumens, now known as the elect, participate in several further rituals. <br>  <br>  The three chief rituals, known as scrutinies, are normally celebrated at Mass on the third, fourth, and fifth Sundays of Lent. The scrutinies are rites for self-searching and repentance. They are meant to bring out the qualities of the catechumen’s soul, to heal those qualities which are weak or sinful, and to strengthen those that are positive and good. <br>  <br>  During this period, the catechumens are formally presented with the Apostles’ Creed and the Lord’s Prayer, which they will recite on the night they are initiated. <br>  <br>  The initiation itself usually occurs on the Easter Vigil, the evening before Easter Day. That evening a special Mass is celebrated at which the catechumens are baptized, then given confirmation, and finally receive the holy Eucharist. At this point the catechumens become Catholics and are received|`|35PwwSvuaa	I'm not sure how England does it but im a catholic and First you go through steps. You need to be baptized. I was when I was a baby but if you really want to you probably need to go talk to the priest and see what he says. Then you will have Holy communion and then Confirmation. I'm in 10th grade and im being confirmed but idk how ur parents wont find out. If you do decide to do it, good luck to you and I hope everything works out. =)|`|akvrwpywaa	I'm not completely sure, but...<br>  If you've already been baptized a Christian, then you don't need to receive the sacrament of Baptism.  If you have not been baptized in any other Christian church, then see a priest to make arrangements for a baptism.<br>  You'll want to go to an Easter Vigil Mass; these are held the day before Easter, and can last a couple hours (much longer than regular Masses).  That is when catechumens are usually initiated into the Church.  In fact you might be able to receive the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist back-to-back then.<br>  (Once you receive the sacrament of Eucharist (Holy Communion), you can receive Holy Communion any time you go to Mass.  Once you are confirmed, you can become an extra-ordinary minister of Holy Communion).|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	This place is not  good place to get answer, believe me.

There are petitions, the Nicene Creed, then the Liturgy of the Eucharist, where bread and wine are changed into God -- the living, risen Jesus! After the Our Father (Lord's Prayer) there is usually the sign of peace, and after several more prayers comes communion.<br>  <br>  Modest attire is required for Mass, but you have a lot of options as to what you want to wear. <br>  <br>  You can contact your local Catholic Church and inquire about their RCIA program.  As far as your parents not finding out, I'd recommend praying the Devotioin to the Seven Sorrows of Mary daily.  See  promise #1:<br>  <br>  The Seven Sorrows of Mary are as follow:<br>  <br>  1. The Prophecy of Simeon<br>  2. The Flight into Egypt<br>  3. The Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple<br>  4. Mary Meets Jesus as He Carries His Cross<br>  5. The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus<br>  6. The Body of Jesus is Taken Down from the Cross and Placed into Mary's Arms<br>  7. Jesus is Placed in the Tomb.<br>  <br>  Mary wishes for us to pray one Hail Mary while meditating on each of the Seven Sorrows, for a total of seven Hail Marys. She has made the following promises to those who do this on a daily basis:<br>  <br>  1. I will grant peace to their families.<br>  2.They will be enlightened about the Divine mysteries.<br>  3. I will console them in their pains and I will accompany them in their work.<br>  4. I will give them as much as they ask for as long as it does not oppose the adorable will of my Divine Son or the sanctification of their souls.<br>  5. I will defend them in their spiritual battles with the infernal enemy and I will protect them at every instant of their lives.<br>  6. I will visibly help them at the moment of their death, they will see the face of their Mother.<br>  7. I have obtained this Grace from my Divine Son, that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and dolors, will be taken directly from this earthly life to eternal happiness since all their sins will be forgiven and my Son and I will be their eternal consolation and joy. <br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave

Call the landlord and have him speak with the person.<br>  <br>  If you dont live in an appartment, and he's actually outside banging on your walls: call the police immediatly the next time he does it!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck :o)|`|hLohtlPEaa	He may have a mental disability. Talk to your landlord first. If you don't get any relief, call the police.|`|0lnamekJaa	Call the cops and file a noise complaint... <br>  <br>  Let the cops deal with this nut-job... That is their job, not yours!|`|CBgDc1Auaa	if it persists and you don't really want to get involved directly... tell the leasing office... or call the cops... it doesn't sound like something is wrong with him it just sounds like he's an incredible dick... <br>  <br>  deal with it man... <br>  <br>  somehow I don't think it's going to have much effect, but if you keep complaining, eventually the apartments will kick him out.. I should know, I was kicked out of my apartment for being loud... well, for my jerk roommates being loud anyway!|`|Lcr9FGS1aa	4 days...the meth should be wearing off soon...|`|c90TJKe4aa	how about you go over there and shut em up|`|929b0210e46cbd96484f7032e99a63afaa	If he's screaming and throwing things at his walls, perhaps you should consider calling the police - how can you say for sure he's home alone? Maybe there is someone there with him, who is the victim of his outrage. If that's not the case, and he has some kind of mental health issue, notifying the police will still be helpful because they can connect him with services which may be beneficial for him.<br>  <br>  Best Regards,<br>  Holly|`|WuhIoS1laa	Call the cops while he's in full form. Make sure the operator can hear the screaming. They will come and have a chat with him, and hopefully it will die down. <br>  <br>  It worked for my neighbor who would leave her dog out at 5:00am while it barked it's head off. The cop could barely hear me over the sound of the dog, and they didn't have a problem coming over to chill her out.|`|XB9VDLGSaa	well, one thing you can do and remain anonymous is to report this to city hall.  there should be a noise by law that prevents this type of noise disturbance.  you tell them about the excessive noise coming from your neighbour (give them the exact address).  even though they will ask you for your name and number,  it is protected under the free information act so your neighbour will never know who call.  ask them to investigate.  they will probably give you a followup call a week afterwards to see if the noise persists.<br>  <br>  you have to figure out what the number to call for city hall in your area.  i'd google something like 'noise complaints' or 'noise by law' and your location.  usually it is under health and safety department.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AA12204752	Why haven't you placed a complaint on this person? That is noise pollution. Either he's on drugs or is mentally ill. Do him a favor and call the cops.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Yo tell your neighbour to shut the **** up or you'll call the cops. If you don't take a firm stance now he'll just do whatever he wants and piss everyone off.|`|ibnaLZGvaa	If you live in an apartment, you can ask the super if he will talk to your neighbor.|`|9P2yKjOQaa	ask the cops to check him up, to be on the safe side|`|12VQ4ETcaa	I had a problem like this!  My upstairs neighbor was fine when he first moved in, but a few months later he was having screaming fights, moving the furniture all the time, and playing his guitar at 4 am.  It turned out he had just gotten out of rehab and he was using crack again.<br>  <br>  I e-mailed my landlady and told her what was going on.  She talked to him and said to tell her if he acted up again.  A few weeks later, he got even worse.  I kept her posted every time the police came and every time he got arrested.  She started eviction proceedings.  He refused to move out.  They had to go back to court and get a different kind of eviction order.  It took five months to finally get rid of him, and by that time the stress from not sleeping was so bad a chunk of my hair fell out.  So, don't confront your noisy neighbor yourself - let your landlord do it.  You have no way of knowing yet what his problem is.

I know there are agencies to track the number of homeless (worldwide) but don't know of any who track those helping!<br>  I might suggest you try contacting NPACH: The National Policy and Advocacy Council on Homelessness.<br>  If they have no stats on what you are after, they may be able to steer you in the right direction.<br>  Contact details at their website:<br>  <a href="http://www.npach.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.npach.org/</a><br>  <br>  Wikipedia has a rather good article on the homeless (remember to check out the external links at the bottom too):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless#Assistance_and_resources_available_to_the_homeless" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless#As...</a><br>  <br>  As do these websites:<br>  <a href="http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28086" rel="nofollow">http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.share-international.org/archives/homelessness/hl-mlaroof.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.share-international.org/archi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Hea-Irr/Homelessness.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.faqs.org/nutrition/Hea-Irr/Ho...</a>

If you don't even see yourself with a white guy then if when you're 18+ you will have no choice but to go against your dad. Sorry but if he's that racist its either family or relationship. BTW ask him about Asian/Mexican guys and what his thoughts on them are. Maybe he only hates blacks thus you can date a wider variety of men.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	how old are you? cause maybe you can find a college away and move out. do you have family that isnt racist that you could live with?<br>  <br>  why dont you talk to the school and tell them, maybe if you can get the school involved they may be able to help with your parents and maybe get your parents into the 21st century.<br>  <br>  or you could just people please your parents until you are able to get away from them.|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	as long as your living in their house you kinda gotta follow the rules...<br>  <br>  you make the rules when you have your own place..<br>  <br>  just don't let them know!|`|AA10067344	Upon being kicked out, your options vary depending on your age.  how old are you?|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	And you are not a male black teenager troll? Blah, blah, blah|`|hZjPYyFTaa	If you are living at home you have to abide by their rules. You aren't going to change your father's beliefs so there is no point in making an issue out of it. Racism isn't a logical response to problems and it's  borne out of ignorance and fear. So rational arguments aren't going to work.<br>  If your parents engage in racist rhetoric - leave the room. It's unacceptable to listen to so walk out - don't storm out. <br>  When you leave home you can live by your own standards and make the rules in your own home.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	my dads like tht too because were arabic and if i dated a man tht was black or even worse a jew he would kill me.. b ti have been with a jewish kid, and it dosent matter to me, and i have had a boyfriend who was a quarter black and dosent bother me either, if he knew about the jewish kid im pretty sure he would disown me as well, no joke.honestly i dont know wat to tell you other thn hide it like i do lol. because he will never agree with you, ever, like my dad, and just wait it out and if one day u may want to marry a black guy thn u might have to face somethings, but as of now hide it and enjoy it.|`|e6939e2c550152ccd357282adb355721aa	You sound really dumb.  But I'd like to answer that as a father if my daughter were to start dating any male at your age I'd go ape-poop.  Once you get an education, college, I mean then you might just have the sense to date a man of same status black, white or yellow.  But until then you are considered plain ignorant.  I've seen too many young girls get knocked up by males and never see that guy again.  That'll be you and your father doesn't want to see that.  Good luck ruining your life.|`|5kjYFb9Taa	This is a tough one. My dad wouldn't like it if I did either. Hm...Well, You should talk to him about it and tell him that's how you are and he needs to accept it. If he still doesn't like it, and you only WILL date black guys, then maybe you should just cut yourself out of the family. OR rethink your dating preferences...I dont know how that would make you feel, but date around. Hope this helps!! Good Luck! :)|`|e9gXZsKxaa	If your under 18, then you parents have the right to give you rules under their house, if your over 18, do what you want but be prepared to kicked out and have a place to stay at.|`|wh3BAc4taa	Don't listen to your parents.

She got pregnant, the guy left her. Big surprise. She's dated many deadbeat black guys, and not to mention been abused by them<br>  I'm not saying that all black men are this way, but they generally are.<br>     At least wait until you're out of the house to date whoever you want. It's really worth avoiding the drama.|`|TfOfVRYnaa	That sucks<br>  Tell your parents that they're racism isn't acceptable today, and that it's that kind of attitude that caused things like the Holocaust. Tell them that all people are the same genetically, and that the human being originated from Africa anyway. Ask them what's wrong with black people in their opinion. Tell them they can't let stereotypes blur their outlook on life. They're probably scared that you'll get into trouble by hanging ou with black people because of how black people are portrayed on TV. Just talk to them|`|5HPkIxZHaa	well respect your parents and learn to love people they like.<br>  my parents are the same way. no lie. if my sister even thinks of marriing a black guy, my parents will trick her and send her back to india, beat her their and force her to never see that black guy ever again. this didnt happen, but i think it will if my sister likes a black guy. my parents want me to marry an indian muslim. not anything else. but they probably wont he as harsh if it was a white person, rather than a black person. but still they wont accept blacks, whites, hispanic or asian.|`|lrJopeC5aa	Sorry to say but there isn't much you can do.

Nothing you say, or do, will change their mind so if you're old enough to move out then do it.  If not.... well you'll just have to be very sneaky.  What do you look like?  J/K.
H8gsDRWeaa	It gets difficult if the languages themselves are difficult (eg Icelandic and Finnish). Otherwise, the good learning habits you use in one class can be readily applied in the other. Some students find it difficult to learn two Romance languages at the same time, or two Slavic, because slippage occurs, and one finds oneself speaking Serbo-Croatian in a Czech class -- a no-no!)<br>  The simultaneous study of two languages will also strengthen your linguistic skills and you will find it easier to study even more additional languages. (it becomes addictive).|`|xBUd1Zvsaa	I am currently taking Spanish III and Latin III. If languages are your strong point, you should take both French and German.

4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	Some gay guys are "flamingly homosexual" for the same reason some straight guys are "super macho".<br>  <br>  Sure, maybe sometimes it's because they feel they have something to prove, because they want to get attention or some other reason... But most of the time, it's because that's just the way they are. It's their personalities. Some people are really masculine and some people are really feminine, no matter what their gender or sexuality. Why treat them as nothing more than a "stereotype" just because they're more flashy than other gay guys...? Isn't that in and of itself prejudiced and creating further stereotypes?<br>  <br>  The Flaming Queens would still exist even if gays had been accepted throughout history. So what if they don't fit gender (or any other socially constructed) roles?<br>  <br>  To John: You don't need to act like your friends because you aren't your friends. They shouldn't expect you to act like them, and you shouldn't expect them to act like you! And then to say that flamboyant or 'flaming' gay guys are "drama queens"... As an ex-football player, how would you like it if people resorted to calling you "the dumb jock"? It's not very fair now, is it, to reduce people down to a single stereotype?<br>  <br>  I won't even touch the assumption that flamers don't have stable relationships, or all behave stupidly. I am very flamboyant, but I am not some idiotic "drama queen" and I am currently enjoying a long term relationship.<br>  <br>  Oi.|`|2zLtIog3aa	Great questions. I have asked myself the same thing. I am gay, and I have no need or reason to act like some of my friends do. Actually there are so many hot guys that I see, and once they open their mouth its such a turn off. It really bothers me. (Specially when they dress with the skinny jeans and the extra small ts, YUCK) - oh or when they plug the eye brows. <br>  But to answer your question, I think you have a point. I think its a way for some to show who they are. I never found the need to be the way and since I am 6'1, 200lbs, ex food ball player, I dont think the style would fit my look. <br>  For the ones reading this: If you ever wonder how come you are so good lucking but have no serious relationships, consider the way you act. I can tell you that first, no one takes you seriously, and second, you may get a lot of one nighters, but thats all you are going to get for a while. Stop acting like a flammer and you will see how your life will improve. <br>  I hate drama queens.|`|gLVbSrx6aa	i disagree with you. i've always felt i don't need to be weird and stand out just because i'm gay and that i can just be an ordinary guy, and i'm sure many other gay guys would agree.|`|S5NsAX7xaa	No. It doesn't work like that. When you're gay , or when your around people who are "fine" with it (ex:boyfriend , gay buddy , accepting friends or parents) you just tend to act that way because you're comfortable and not analyzing how you may come off. "Flaming" gay men act the way they do because they choose to be rebellious and show the world who they are (or how they feel) . Flamboyantly gay men act flaming whether homophobes are present or not.

I suggest you do some more reading on this if you are truly interested in finding the answers to your questions.

Christians falsely claim that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah even though he does not match the description in the Hebrew Scriptures.  Christians then mistranslated the Hebrew Scriptures and call their mistranslation the OT.  They believe this mistranslation supports the idea that Jesus is the Jewish messiah.  But the Jewish Messiah has absolutely nothing to do with getting into heaven.|`|AA11598520	The Old Testament is the Word of God before Jesus, the Christ existed. The Old Testament tells the story of the people to whom the Christ or Messiah was promised. It also contains prophesies of the coming of the Christ.

It's a collection of myths and stories, a little bit of history, and some interesting poems.  You'll notice that in the old testament, there's no afterlife mentioned...that's because the jews don't believe in one.  To them, "heaven" is just the place where god dwells, while people dwell here on earth.  And they had no hell.  The god of the old testament was one of many gods (the hebrews considered the gods of other cultures real gods), it's just that the god of the hebrews was *their* god, meant to guide and protect *them* and nobody else.<br>  <br>  The New Testament is a collection of myths and stories about jesus.  It was put together by a group of bishops (this was before there was a "catholic" church) over a period of about 30 years in the 4th century CE.  They decided which myths and stories would go in it and which would be left out based on what dogma they wanted to enforce and which ideas they wanted to suppress.  It's completely different -- including a completely different conception of god, the idea of an afterlife, the idea that jesus was the "messiah," etc. from the old testament.   The two of them together make up "the bible."<br>  <br>  But "the bible" isn't "the bible."  There are hundreds of different versions.  Some of them include some of the books that the bishops didn't want in, and leave some of the ones you have out.  There are literally thousands of different translations (not one of which comes from any "original" source), and most of these various versions have some pretty big doctrinal differences.  <br>  <br>  In short:  there is no "the bible."  There are various collections of writings from various people that are put together in various ways and called bibles, but there are all kinds of different ones.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|AA11703455	The phrases "old" and "new" are man originated and has nothing to do with the unity of the Bible or its message.

(Compare Ac 2:4; Heb 2:3, 4.) <br>  The Law Covenant had been pointing to the need for the Messiah, & was no longer needed, since he had come & done as prophesied.

The only questions I have are : Was the man known to be a sex offender, or someone who was criminally dangerously insane or mentally ill?  Was there neglect on the part of a person or persons (caretakers or the Justice System)responsible for keeping him from the public and/or children? Was the offender a family member and were the family aware of his mental problems and failed to protect their child? <br>  <br>  Any man who rapes or sexually molests a child or any person who sexually assaults another person should get the death penalty IMO. <br>  <br>  In cases of Alzheimer's or dementia, mental illness or disease that has created this kind of sexual aggression and behaviour then someone is or should be accountable for controlling his behaviour, there are medications for one thing, and making sure he is kept from the public in a secure facility.<br>  <br>  Society is far too ready to try and excuse criminal behavior. Thousands upon thousands of people had abusive childhoods and did NOT grow up to criminals, rapists, and sexual predators, that is pure bull sh*t and research does NOT support any proof of predisposition. It is a matter of free will and choice. Some people CHOOSE to hurt other people to retataliate for the hurt done to them, they are not unable to control their impulses or behavior, they CHOOSE not to. <br>  <br>  The feel justified, someone hurt me so I am going to hurt someone else.

jcK6EXpiaa	yes, but its mostly the fault of the individuals. there are food banks, soup bars and food stamps. When children starve, its because somebody is neglecting them. When there isn't enough funding for a soup bar or food bank, its because the government is being neglectful of its people. Have you ever seen a child eat out of a garbage can? I was 9 years old the first time I saw this. She was a toddler, eating with her mother. I was on a field trip with my school (we were going to the Seattle Pacific Science Center) I ran from my group (we were walking from the bus) to give her my lunch. I have never been able to forget this moment...especially since its completely unnecessary. That building I was walking into probably costs the government hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in federal grants, yet they cant spare a few thousand of those dollars to allow people to eat crappy soup and sandwhiches three times a day. I didn't know how that building got all its money then, but I remember my exact thought as I sat down in the IMAX theater "I wonder how much food I could have bought with the money my mom gave me for this field trip". Our nation produces enough food every year to feed seven times entire human population three square meals a day, yet we still starve our people, and degrade them into having to dig in our trash for food. In Senegal, shop keepers in Tambacounda give away food at the end of the day. It doesn't put them out of business. Why cant we do the same? Its rediculous, the Town and Country store near my house has a big old chainlink fence around their garbage cans with pad locks, to keep people from taking the tossed produce.

Don't you know that Christians and Jews worship the same God?|`|DTog0VZWaa	That is a question that reflects one of the basic differences in orientation of Judaism & Christianity.<br>  <br>  Judaism is about using Torah as a way to search for the moral standards to use in life (justice & a just way of living).  God is loving in Judaism by giving us Torah to guide us in this moral search.  Christianity is about sentiment, about feeling love of God and through that love, doing good actions.  So while both include the other element too,, the central focus is opposite.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  Judasim uses the 10 commandments to dig in deeply into morality.  You shouldn't murder is anaylzed & evaluated from every angle until it's determined exactly what is murder.  It was concluded early on that not supporting widows & their children is murder because they won't be able to take care of themselves.  Judaism has detailed descriptions of what is self-defensive & what is not.  It would be common in Judaism to study this commandment at this level for -anyone- studying it.  It is through that study that the values of Judaism come through & connection to their better & through that they feel connection to the "in god's image" inside themselves & to God itself.  It also carries the morality into the realm of justice - many of the assessments are about finding the fine lines of laws between people to help people live with each other in a just way & to create a just way of being in this world together.<br>  <br>  I'm a little fuzzier on Christianity on this, but I know they don't go into or evalute for morality details in the same way at all.  They look for the love of God to be felt inside to be enough to help one be good & to help one feel less guilty if they do err.<br>  <br>  =========================<br>  Just to clarify from another answerer -<br>  In Judaism, God is not looking for perfection.  He expects humans to be "human."  He's looking for striving towards, & does not consider that humans need to reach perfect -- hence in Judaism there is no need for a state of grace, & there is no original sin concept.  Christianity often teaches that Judaism expects perfection in too many rules but that's an outside view that is totally mistaken.<br>  <br>  =======================<br>  What TD fairy just showed their 1. lack of knowledge of what this "homework" question is about (& it is a homework question because it's a classic topic.)  2. their intolerance by TD instead of answering with something meaningful of their own to counter it?|`|3KD6RRhPaa	The true God is like a coin, one side is His great love, and the other side His terrible justice.<br>  <br>  Those that think God is just love are barking up a tree. He demands perfection, and will not allow anyone with sin to stand in His presence with sin. He provided a way for us to become sinless and righteous, but no one want to listen to Him, but rather are trying to climb in another way (John 10:1).|`|te9y6MQkaa	Justice/Judgment is Geburah.

And you?)|`|KZ2vpRnEaa	?Cómo estás?<br>  <br>  Native spanish speaker ^^|`|DapWZJ5Maa	Hola, Como estas?|`|SDhKNBBkaa	... and then you could say...<br>  <br>  You are beautiful (handsome) - Eres guapa (guapo) <br>  You have a beautiful smile - Tu sonrisa es bonita <br>  I am crazy about you - Estoy loco por ti. <br>  You make me passionate - Me apasiones. <br>  You enchant me - Me encantes. <br>  You drive me crazy - Me vuelves loco. <br>  Kiss me - bésame <br>  Hug me - abrázame <br>  I care for you (cherish) - Te quiero. <br>  I love you - Te amo. <br>  love - el amor <br>  I need you - Te necesito. <br>  I desire you - Te deseo. <br>  I miss you - Te extra?o. <br>  I am going to miss you - Te voy a echar de menos. <br>  I miss you - Te echo de menos. <br>  I will be dreaming of you - Voy a so?ar contigo. <br>  You smell good - hueles rico <br>  I am attracted to you - me gustes <br>  True love - amor verdadero <br>  Would you like to be my boyfriend (girlfriend) - Quieres ser mi novio (novia)? <br>  Take (very good) care of yourself - Cuidate mucho <br>  I like you (attracted) - Me gustes a mi.|`|pd5rERcfaa	If you're speaking to a friend, "Como estas?"

(and I left out the accents cause I'm not sure how to put them on there).
pMFLqU0Yaa	I agree that Slipknot is one of the most vile, disgusting bands on the planet. They're right up there with "new" Metallica. There's only one thing to do about it. Force him to listen to True Norwegian Black Metal. Staple the damn earbuds to his head if you must. Start with Emperor than move on to Carpathian Forest before ending with Gorgoroth (Gaahl fronted version, of course.) Once you are convinced he is truly repentant, take him to the city gates and stone him to death before he can sin again. Remember, Jesus didn't come to take a single letter from the law. The bible says so, so it must be true and you are obligated to follow its every word!<br>  <br>  Edit: Blessed Oein, great war god! Did someone just say that Slipknot was....metal?!!?<br>  <br>  *faints*<br>  <br>  Edit 2: I weep for the new generation if they truly believe bands like Slipknot are metal. I feel somewhat responsible for this. Instead of running amok through the streets of various Norwegian cities with then-garage band members, I should have come to the US much sooner and spread their demo tapes about. *sigh* I'm sorry. Will you ever forgive me  for my part in the pussification of this generation?<br>  <br>  (and Vadeking made me LOL!)|`|3KctJ1lsaa	listen hear, dont diss the metal, jsut ebcause it sounds "heavy" doesnt mean its satanic, in fact, probably 99% of it has nothing to do with satan (that 1% being true black metal) be thankful he isnt listening to deicide or cannibal corpse (even though those bands rock i dont like there lyrics.) <br>  <br>  i am a christian, but i take reality as is, and metal isnt bad, your a bigot.<br>  <br>  edit: if your talking to me with that edit of yours, slipknot is metal, its nu-metal, its not very ******* heavy or anything but its still metal.|`|17G1kndlaa	He is twenty first of all and capable of making his own decisions. And you are not God, you have no right to punish anyone for their sins. You can talk to him like one adult to another, but you cannot make his decisions for him. Think about it, if he believed in god just because you forced it on him, is that really believing? He will find his own way.|`|KCVXW5sfaa	Why dont you try to remember centuries ago when you were a kid and remember how hard it is, and how kids go through phases. The harder you push the bible and jesus on your kid, the farther away from god you'll get him. trust me.... Seriously, TRUST ME. My mother tried the same CRAP you're doing to you kids. And to this day, I do not believe in God, and I do not want any part of Christianity. And she is partially to blame.<br>  <br>  Mind your own damn business. Music will NOT harm your kid, and anyone who says differently is just plain stupid. <br>  <br>  If your want your kid to never speak to you again when he is old enough, you had best lay off. Over protective Christianty parents often lose their kids to really bad things by trying to smother the hell out of them literally. Kids who are forbidden to do this or that often find ways ... So the harder you push, the harder they'll push back.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying let your kid get away with everything... but music like that isnt something you should try to control no matter what your magic book tells you.<br>  <br>  Damn, I just read where you say he's 20!!! You're a nut! leave him ALONE!|`|VYwMHnw6aa	LOL stone him?<br>  seriously, slipknot's really not that bad.... better than the mediocre sludge that passes for christian music.|`|aRRQrwd9aa	Slipknot does have songs singing about God! (and not in a bad way)|`|HhmEkVlvaa	for starters you can just shut the hell up and second you can go shove a bible in a very unpleasant place on yourself|`|etIBdVE3aa	wtf is a 20 yr old living in your house????|`|XTqi1zeVaa	Do what your bible says and stone him. Either that or force him to leave home and resent you forever you pathetic excuse for a father.|`|O3uAo1ZEaa	You must kill your first born son.|`|iJzlRCkOaa	Dude... he's 20.  Plus, it's just music.  I'm personally not wild about Slipknot (well, for the day I am =P), but I know them.  You're making such a big fat deal out of something that's none of your business at all.|`|AA12041870	Take his stereo (or whatever he is listening to his music on) away from him.  Be aware that you are going to drive a wedge between you and him.  God gave him his own brain to think with, and you don't really have any right to tell him what to like and not like.  That's why I can't stand organized religion.  If you don't believe like everyone in the room, you aren't a good person.  Bull crap.|`|87CAVhs2aa	I'm pretty sure the bible allows human sacrifice and stone-throwing, have you tried that?<br>  <br>  "18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, 19 his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town. 20 They shall say to the elders, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard." 21 Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid."<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 21:18-21|`|5AbCtkWFaa	Tell him to please turn down the stereo, that just because he and his girlfriend like that music doesn't mean everyone on the block wants to hear it.  If he doesn't like it, he can move out and risk eviction blaring his music in an apartment.|`|AA11579058	Biblically speaking, I don't think you have a leg to stand on.  I just checked my Bible and I couldn't find the commandment "Thou shalt not listen to Slipknot nor any such tintinnabulations which doth poison the ears of thy parents."|`|xbCGVdiOaa	Buy him a Cradle of Filth CD.  They're much better than Slipknot.

MiDYJ8tMaa	Smith and Hall gives 'canticum sacrum' - obviously anthem in the ecclesiastical music sense. 'Canticum' alone is 'song, passage in a comedy chanted or sung', but the adjective 'sacrum' moves it out of the comedy arena. <br>  <br>  Antiphona shows up as Medieval Latin, and rare even there.Motetum shows as NeoLatin - modern words formed in the style of Latin.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	My Cassell's Latin Dictionary gives "cantus" (masculine, fourth declension) and "carmen"  (neuter, third).  t ome, neither one has quite the specific connotation of "anthem," but both do have either religious or legal uses.  "Paean," a hymn of praise (originally only to Apollo but later extended to other gods) might suit your purpose better, but it may have too pagan a connotation, too.|`|7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	Anthem: [Middle English anteme, from Old English antefn, from Late Latin antiphōna, from Late Greek, from neuter pl. of antiphōnos, sounding in answer : anti-, in return; see anti– + phōnē, voice.]|`|icEMyJBoaa	motetum|`|IQT1BFjDaa	What about "carmen, carminis"? or "hymnus, hymni" from the greek.

7gH7sgi6aa	I do agree that Congrats are in order for Wyomugs, but we also should give Sheridam the credit due for the long period she held that top spot.<br>  This is the etiquette section and we are here to answers on manners and etiquette and slandering how others answer questions and ask questions is quite inappropriate.<br>  I've been in this section for a long time, but was gone for a month or so because I have Lupus and Fibromyalgia and had a bad flare up and also broke my arm, which is still in a cast.  I've never sought out to be "best anything".  I just answer questions to the best of my ability and try to help people out.<br>  This is not a "game" to see who can outdo the other we are here to answer questions and to help one another.<br>  I would expect better of people in the etiquette section.  Both from the asker and answers.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|O4jGlC2caa	No congratulations here.  I don't always agree with Wyomugs answers and question their real reason for posting on here sometimes.<br>  <br>  As for Top Contributor, just lost mine... probably because I'm hanging around another section along with this one.  Just keep trying to answer questions in the category you had Top Contributor in.  Try to get Best Answers.  Mine went away before because I couldn't get to Y!A for about a week.  Then I got it back.  Now it went away again.  I'll get it back again eventually.
7gH7sgi6aa	Sometimes people "say" they don't want to "hear" it when inside they are "crying" out to hear your apology.  Be sincere and true and honest and let it come from your heart.  Tell them how sorry you are and that you will never let it happen again.  Tell them that if they need some space or time to think about things you will give them that.  Finish by telling them how important they are in your life and how you would feel if they were not a part of your life.  Wait a few minutes to see if they are going to react, and if not just give them some space.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|DZCFD0p2aa	SHOUT really loudly into their ear.|`|3kboRgkzaa	Make sure to get the point across that what you need to say is important.

Why should you bend over backwards for someone who doesn't want to hear it.

Pgam2HLuaa	I'm tempted to answer the question but I'm concerned that others will require me to burn for all eternity if my response does not agree with their point of view .|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Actually, it will turn out that it's the Christians that are choosing hell.<br>  <br>  Atheists will be in paradise, but God won't be there.  Christians will be in the same place but they'll think they're in hell because God isn't there.  They will *chose* to believe they are in hell.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Yup.  <br>  <br>  Christians should be preaching the "Good News" not the "Hey there's a hell and you're headed for it News."|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	NOPE<br>  <br>  If we don't then we aren't responsible for our actions and we are just a bunch of  VICTIMS.  - Think about it.. if we go to hell and didn't choose it, then that makes us a essentially a victim, all our lives, despite our best efforts. If we complain about it..then we are just whiney victims. If we tried our best and STILL failed and ended up in hell thru no fault of our own..then we are "pathetic" victims on top of all that. <br>  This goes for Christian OR Non-Christian alike.<br>  <br>  We'd be essentially whiney pathetic victims if there is in fact a God and he puts us in Hell, despite our best efforts to the contrary..if we have no say over it.  That is.. unless we choose it thru our actions or in-actions. <br>  <br>  Freewill is a fickle mistress if you think about it.  BUT, it is the only way to avoid pre-destiny, victimization, and not being responsible for our own actions. - So freewill is the only way to say : " Yeah, I CHOSE that, I'll man-up to my actions!"<br>  AGAIN, this goes for Christians OR Non-Christians alike.<br>  <br>  Personally,  I don't like being a victim.  I like having a choice.  I don't like someone else forcing something on me.<br>  <br>  I choose freewill.. that means I'M responsible for my actions.. not someone else.  The judgement that comes from those actions are MY responsibility not someone else's. <br>  <br>  <br>  The way I see it,  if there is a God,  then I can't have BOTH Freewill AND avoid choosing hell (thru my actions or in-action)<br>  <br>  If this means I  "in essence"  choose hell.. so be it. I'll man up to it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  OH dang it.. I'm Catholic!  <----  Who let him in here??<br>  Damm those Christians.. always sneakin' into open questions where they aren't wanted.|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	Not irritating. I find it incredibly dishonest and often stupid.|`|AA11946554	Sometimes it irritates, other times I roll my eyes and sometimes I laugh :-)|`|kFpFU97zaa	Hells yes.|`|AA11403032	It's not irritating.  It gives me a laugh as to how illogically naive they can be.<br>  <br>  Logically the only people who can go to the christian hell are christians.<br>  <br>  The rest of us can't go because it just doesn't exist for us.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile the christians live in fear of going to this terrible place that they invented.  Why not give up the fear and live sane logical lives like the rest of us?|`|a7282602981644d2fff09b1a41ac653faa	In that case the majority of the worlds population choses hell without even knowing it. Ironic heh? But if that's the case I think you will meet a lot more interesting people there than in heaven : ) Actually what I think is that hell is probably a lot of fun. Because religion tries to tell us that everything that is fun is bad for you. So probably in hell you will have a lot of sex and good laughs and food etc... Coming to heaven would probably be like living with the family from the tv-series "seventh heaven". You would die from boredom within minutes. ah yeah, hehe, but there is a solution for that as well. If you are so unlucky that you end up there, you just have to get intimate with the older daughter, the pretty one and then you will be sent straight to hell, hahahaha. and so the good life begins. yeah man.|`|gxWYcxa3aa	I just smile and shake my head. I don't even believe in their hell.<br>  <br>  Edit: I also don't believe in heaven, for the ones going =O YOU NOT GONNA GO HEAVENZ. I'm one of those ones that believes in an intermediate plain for everyone to rest 'til reincarnation.|`|AA10637643	Yeah, and I'm a Mormon!  I think it's very arrogant they "think" they know who's going "where" and they aren't afraid to tell you!<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ will be the judge... not all the lovely Christians, thank heaven.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Oh yeah.|`|d7417f76fabaaeaca09baa21844aa149aa	Not really.<br>  If you don't believe in hell, what the hell?|`|dz5Og81Qaa	yes|`|pDmTRG82aa	not really. I already know that they haven't questioned their beliefs.<br>  <br>  a debate is only worthy with people who can critically think. in my opinion most people who are highly devoted to their religion aren't really critical thinkers.<br>  <br>  so I just ignore them and dont take them seriously.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  if it helps just do this. tell them that some "christians" are also choosing hell for the sins they commit. if god considers not accepting his son as big of a sin as lying(he doesnt consider one sin more than the other. to him a sin is a sin regardless) then it isn't any different for a christian to be gay or lust than for someone to not accept his son.<br>  <br>  not that I agree with the christian god's judgment. thats just how it is according to christianity|`|ux4rkJKdaa	I am a christian...They don't "choose" hell, they choose to beleive what they want..>Sorry if I get a little preachy, but it is to help non-christians, so please understand...God created everyone with a free will, the ability to make their own choices, live their own lives, make their own decisions. IF they want to beleive another religeon, that is the choice they make, and if they wish to become christian at some point that is also their decision...God gave us free will not so we could change someone elses, but so we could make our own decisions and understand anyone elses...The same applies for alot of things.|`|4H9zv8lAaa	Technically speaking, by not acknowledging something are you still making a choice?  <br>  <br>  What would happen if I were to tell you that going forward you can choose to be called either Buffy or Moon Unit and you choose neither?  Then I said that it doesn’t matter what name you choose because I’m going to give you a name based solely on your actions.  In reality, your “choice” was only an illusion if the name that you desired could only be acquired if you meet a certain criteria or if you truly desired neither of the choices presented.  No one will argue that it is not logical to say you have been given free will to choose, but you will be punished if you do not choose what has been suggest.  Sounds more to me like intimidation and coercion than free will.|`|0vDC99t0aa	well they kind of do when they don't ask god in to there heart to save them. and i have to tell you god loves you. and the DEVIL hates you<br>  see god does good and DEVIL does bad just remember that.  and i am a christian.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	EXTREMELY.<br>  i mean don't get me wrong i have no problems with religion whatsoever i just don't like it forced on me or if people try to make me feel inferior to them for not sharing their beliefs.<br>  i just think some people need to be more accepting<br>  :/|`|b1yr0KDEaa	That's like claiming that since Christians don't worship Zeus, they are "choosing" to spend eternity in Tartarus (home of the banished Titans in Greek mythology).|`|htQrkD8waa	if you don't believe thier mythology why does it annoy you.<br>  <br>  just tell them you aren't christian/jew/muslim because you would rather chose intelligence than stupiditiy.|`|isRDHbJgaa	Not extremely irritating. Imagine living with this fear of going to hell, I feel bad for them.|`|x7AHHWvaaa	Infuriatingly so...|`|GbxIb7sgaa	no<br>  <br>  does anyone else find it annoying when these little atheists say "buy bull" and "jeebus" ?<br>  <br>  <br>   So immature!|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"yeah. it freakin drives me nuts cus they're saying that we choose to go to hell even though we don't believe in it"|`|jSWhvSQnaa	YES! it's so obscenely annoying!
ljzb6fZBaa	This is encouraging news indeed. As sister Robin shared, couples who met online would get to share their hearts before they met each other in person. This helps both parties to understand each other at a deep and personal level. It creates a closer bond since meaningful spiritual communion is established, just like we grow deeper in love with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ through His Spirit and the Word though we have not yet seen Him in person. :) "Deep calleth unto deep" (Psalm 42:7) Thanks for sharing, sister Grace.

I think that there is a positive result of talking online because you can really be yourself and no one is looking right at ya. You can pretty much share your true feelings and people can take it or leave it. I've even had people care enough to email me and correct me on a wrong understanding or just say something nice. So it doesn't really surprise me either. When you can't see a person, you get to know what is on the inside before you get to know what is on the outside and the inner is much more important.
aO4iCwtoaa	The prophecies are not that straightforward.  It doesn't say "third Temple" - if it did, Christians would have already built it to prove Jesus fit the bill.  It does say that there will be an ingathering of all Jews to Jerusalem, and that Jews will all serve G-d (or something along those lines).  When the Temple was still standing, that was a no-brainer - it was probably assumed to mean that those Jews who had turned away from serving G-d would return.  Once the Temple was destroyed, in order for that prophecy to be fulfilled, it became clear that a new Temple would need to be rebuilt, because sacrifices can only be offered in the Temple (and that was the main way that Jews served G-d in Biblical days - through sacrifice).  <br>  <br>  It's sort of like someone making a prediction that there would one day be a ruler who would give every person a new Corvette.  Right now that prediction is simple.  But if GM goes out of business, and a hundred years go by, the only way that prediction would come true is if GM starts up again (assuming that only GM could make a Corvette, in the same way that the Temple is the only place appropriate for sacrifices), so that there would be Corvettes again for the ruler to give away.  So even though the prediction wasn't literally "a ruler will come and resuscitate General Motors," that would still need to happen in order to say that the prediction would come true.|`|BzWQap1Haa	The way I gather it, the Mashiach prophecy guarantees that the Temple in Jerusalem will be built to last.  Since the 2nd Temple obviously did not last and was destroyed in 70 CE, then the Mashiach will have to oversee/create the Third (and hopefully last) Temple.

TwcAQPupaa	Speaking as someone who was born with homosexual tendencies, these quotes give me comfort and peace.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	I agree with the quotes you give. Regarding church discipline though, it is noticeable that 'some' churches are very keen to exercise this discipline for certain moral issues and shy away from others. All moral (which usually involves something sexual) issues should be treated equally and that must include, adultery, sex before marriage, having a child before marriage, as well as homosexuality. The church should use the same discipline for all. <br>  <br>  Other sexual matters are out of the hands of the church because they are breaches of law e.g. incest and rape.|`|AA10637643	LDS member here...<br>  <br>  And yes, I agree.<br>  <br>  It's very interesting, and actually prophecy, that the world is starting to call evil good and good evil.  Things like "it's not a choice" and "I was born this way" and "it's who I am"... I think are all a big crock.  Satan wants people to think it's "OK" to be gay.  It's not.  <br>  <br>  I could similarly argue that people who are alcoholics are just "born that way" or men who are pedophiles aren't "making a choice"... it's a temptation and one that is being given into I say partly because the world is constantly telling them it's OK, and not the Spirit of God.<br>  <br>  I think it's very sad.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	My question to that person would be, why, then does your church allow divorce since its against your rules  of adultery?

But there are a couple things to keep in mind : <br>  <br>  A. The United States believes in separation of Church and State. If the Government isn't allowed to have a statue of the 10 commandments then why on Earth would they be allowed to instate religious laws?<br>  <br>  B. Marriage is originally a religious ceremony, but in major countries around the world it is now used as a "civil union" of sorts. It simply binds two people together economically and socially. The proposed solution is let anyone marry anyone, and leave it to the discretion of the pastors performing the ceremony to decide if they want to perform it or not. That way if a pastor wants to hold on to the religious sanctity of the marriage he can refuse to allow an "unholy marriage." However, if someone else believes (like me) that there is nothing wrong with gay marriage, then they can perform the ceremony. <br>  <br>  We understand that Christians may have good intentions, but quite honestly we don't all want to live by your rules. Please try to understand that. Many of us are more than willing to risk eternal damnation to do what we want because we don't believe in hell. Being pushy is only going to make it worse.|`|vouUQQzBaa	I say stop acting almighty. Rebuke ignorance, research the reason WHY gays are gays (it's not a choice) and stop rambling all the non-sense about what God would like. HE hasn't spoken to anyone directly.<br>  <br>  You don't know what HE wants (assuming you believe in HIM to begin with). Who gives you the right to judge what's right and wrong?<br>  <br>  To me, polygamy is wrong (and I don't go around pushing my beliefs on others), to others, it may not. Polygamy however is a choice, homosexuality is NOT.<br>  <br>  Education pays!|`|ncXMA6rsaa	I think it's very condescending and ignorant. If you are not gay yourself you cannot and do not understand what it's like to be gay. Treating it like some kind of disability is cruel. Please stop persecuting these people and leave them alone, they aren't hurting anyone.<br>  <br>  Expecting gays to never feel love or true happiness, never have a relationship with someone they love, is abhorrent. It's a lot different than abstaining from 'alcohol' or something. Not everyone believes in your god either so assuming superiority on the matter is erroneous. I think you should just leave them alone. This is bullying at its worst.<br>  <br>  You are treating it like a disability. You're treating it like there's something seriously wrong with them and they NEED your help. They don't need you to make them feel crap, which is all you do by constantly referring to their feelings as 'so called' etc. If you were a decent person you would just leave them alone and stop trying to fix something which isn't broken.|`|AA11713693	Yes I can agree with that. I have heard of so many members of the church whole you thought were true to the church and then you hear that they have been excommunicated from the church and it is such a shock to us all. It gets me wondering on what actually went wrong and what made them take this path of destruction in their lives for them to get excommunicated from the church?|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	I agree with it and I follow it. <br>  <br>  One poster mentioned that  we are condemning people to loneliness and if the shoe was on the other foot... <br>  <br>  The same goes for members who are straight. We are expected to live a chase and virtuous lifestyle. This means no premartial sex, no pornography and no experimentation with sex at all. <br>  <br>  I am a single 27 year old woman, I have kept myself chase and pure and looking for the right individual in my life. How is this any different than anyone else who can practice restraint and self control? It's not. Our church's standards are high. The church is not for those who are unable to live these standards, it does require a faithful path.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	It's sad, really.

There are Holy Days of Obligation, meaning days that the Catholic Church mandates that you attend mass such as Christmas, New Year's Day, Easter, All Saints Day, etc., and then there are other important days Good Friday, Holy Thursday, and people's favorite saint Feast Days, such as St. Patrick. St. Patrick has become more of a secular holiday in the US celebrating all things Irish. For a history of St. Patrick's feast day, and the traditions associated with it see below.|`|RSdcFIk7aa	Most holidays are linked to faiths and religions (see etymolgy above). Christian holidays are defined as part of the liturgical year. The Catholic patronal feast day or 'name day' are celebrated in each place's patron saint's day, according to the Calendar of saints. In Islam, the largest holidays are Eid and Ramadan. Hindus, Jains and Sikhs observe several holidays, one of the largest being Diwali (Festival of Light). Japanese holidays contain references to several different faiths and beliefs. Celtic, Norse, and Neopagan holidays follow the order of the Wheel of the Year. Some are closely linked to Swedish festivities. The Bahá'í Faith observes holidays as defined by the Bahá'í calendar. Jews have two holiday seasons: the Spring Feasts of Pesach (Passover), Chag Ha-Matzot (Festival of Unleavened Bread), and Shavuot (Weeks, called Pentacost in Greek); and the Fall Feasts of Yom Teruah (Day of Blessing, also called Rosh HaShannah), Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and Sukkot (Tabernacles).|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	Easter is the most important.

yDkSq8rBaa	You're quoting Luke 17:20-21 - <br>  <br>   "Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, 'See here!' or 'See there!' For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you." <br>  <br>  Jesus is making a distinct point that the Kingdom of God began as soon as He paid the penalty for sin a rose again.  Followers of Jesus are members of this Kingdom.  Paul calls us "Sons (and Daughters) of God" and "Heirs of the Kingdom".  While we are here on Earth, our role is to be "in the world, but not of the world", as Jesus said.<br>  <br>  To avoid confusion for those who were listening, Jesus goes on to talk about his second coming, calling it the Day of the Son of Man.  See the second half of Luke 17.|`|v0BCIQpnaa	(Michael, see Edit #6)<br>  <br>  Your question is confusing.  Jesus did not say that the Kingdom does not come with observance.  What Book, chapter, verse, and what translation are you referring to?<br>  <br>  If it's King James, your question is written in a dialect that people no longer speak.<br>  <br>  Edit #1:  Noonehome.

I'm pretty sure he didn't say it.<br>  Edit #4  Maybe I need to turn off my computer and take a nap...I've not had so many edits before.  Could be a sign?<br>  Edit #5  I give up.  Will check for more info. later.  Nap time!<br>  Edit #6  Juniper, you found it.  I am humbled.  Hey everyone, Juniper's got it right!!!  (Here it is Michael) Those Pharisees observance meant following a bunch or rules, and that this brought about the Kingdom.  God wants to be your "father", and call you "Son".  It's about relationship.  God loves us and has a wonderful plan for our lives.  He doesn't want us to focus our lives on observing and following rules.  Now, the only reason my answer is better is because I'm much more conversational and take a "team approach", and I really do smell fine today.

I like how cool and peaceful it is in churches. I don't go to services, I think they're embarrassing, but its kind of nice to just sit in them (no, I don't feel anything particularly spiritual, they're just calm and relaxing :P  )<br>  <br>  Plus for ages the closest church to where I lived was Canterbury cathedral, which is a truly majestic building. Once I wandered in there and the choir was practicing, the sound was phenomenal. It was great, there was just me and a few tourists listening to this wonderful music, in such a beautiful setting. There's lots of nice art in there too.<br>  <br>  Modern churches I can take or leave, but old ones are awesome.|`|Ma10Exocaa	Three years ago, I think.  <br>  <br>  My son played in one of those "Upwards" basketball programs.  <br>  <br>  Very little on basketball fundamentals, kinda heavy on the "Oh, so aren't you coming to our church now?"|`|M3sVQm2Maa	Some time in October, I think.

I remember fainting in the pews from being on my knees so long.  (catholics aren't allowed to eat before communion.)  A few other little girls next to me passed out as well.  We were dropping like flies!!  lolol....<br>  <br>  I'm glad it happened actually, because it put me on a more productive and healthy path, one that doesn't involve religion but involves one's own Personal Truth.  :)  This Personal Truth is available to everyone and religion isn't a requirement.|`|LF4vun1maa	'bout two years ago, I guess.<br>  <br>  It was pretty uncomfortable.

How could I leave ? <br>  <br>  Taking up wood carving, sculpture, is still on the list. <br>  <br>  Short term for this summer, going to do my best to go camping again, go horse back riding again, sailing again, get out and do a LOT more and not be a slave to house renovations. Going to go swimming a lot more and with the price of gas low, going to make a few trips in my car, maybe local, maybe not :-)  I am trying to get most of the small things done around the house now, the painting, etc.  I figure I have 3 or 4 months to get most of it done. Putting up blinds and curtains is really hard on my back and shoulders though and so is painting. But I dont want to be doing it in the summer and not having any fun with my life.  I've wasted too much of my life already on stuff that in the long run isnt as important as living it and doing things I enjoy doing.<br>  <br>  Good question !!  What is life without a dream?

In Heaven, we will still have free will, but those of us who will be there have the greatest need to depend on Him.

hmU2udmRaa	there is no evidence, and since there is no evidence, there is no reason to believe in a god.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	But the claim that there is no evidence is just another name for investigating God and concluding 'No'. <br>  <br>  Look it up. Plato and Aristotle and the OT and NT and historic Christianity agree :<br>  "the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason."<br>  <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c1.htm</a><br>  <br>  So at least THEIR belief is testable by reason.<br>  <br>  As with all your posts you claim scepticism EXCEPT in the case of a convert. You somehow know they must be wrong. How do you do it. Is it like the shabby way Dawkins treats Antony Flew because his reason didn't agree with Dawkins'.<br>  <br>  How can a sceptic know that someone who claims to know (and is therefore not a sceptic) is wrong.  <br>  <br>  That is monstrously stupid.|`|V1MptCMiaa	I don't believe in the god that's in the bible because that book makes no sense and there is no evidence of a god.

Anecdotes and friend of a friend stories do not count as evidence.<br>  And absence of evidence, is indeed, evidence of absence.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	I don't necessarily believe there is no god, I do not have a belief that there is a god. Of course, the total lack of evidence tells me that there is no reason to believe there is a god.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	I would start from a different angle -- what is the purpose of (belief in) God?<br>  <br>  I am an atheist.  I see no evidence for personal, active God who cares for me or what I do.<br>  <br>  The idea of  "no evidence either way" holds up for a very general kind of God:  one who doesn't give a darn toot and who doesn't concern himself with anything or anybody in the "material" world in which we live.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	The most commonly stated rule for determining the date of Easter is that it is the first Sunday that follows the first full moon after the vernal equinox.  This means that in Roman Catholic, Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Protestant churches, Easter can fall as early as March 22 and as late as April 25.  In actuality, the rule given above is a something of an over-simplification because the calculation of the date of Easter involves ecclesiastical definitions that do not exactly correspond to astronomical observations.  For a complete discussion of the definitions and algorithms used to calculate the date of Easter, refer to The Date of Easter from the web site of the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory. <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|8t1JCFMSaa	Easter is a moveable feast, meaning it is not fixed in relation to the civil calendar. Easter falls at some point between late March and late April each year (early April to early May in Eastern Christianity), following the cycle of the moon. After several centuries of disagreement, all churches accepted the computation of the Alexandrian Church (now the Coptic Church) that Easter is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which is the first moon whose 14th day (the ecclesiastic "full moon") is on or after March 21 (the ecclesiastic "vernal equinox").|`|AA11348638	It is the first Sunday after the first day of Spring that has a full moon.|`|OoQ77Uu6aa	has to do with the equanox...

I don't mind tomboys, in fact they are pretty cool most of the time.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	It's just intimidating to a guy.  You could be seen as more of a buddy than a girlfriend type.  It's no problem to be into sports and whatnot, but when you aren't playing sports be flirty and a little more "girly" so every guy can see that you really are the best of both worlds!|`|NTUr0t3haa	If you're extremely competitive and always trying to beat them or be better than they are, they may not feel romantic about it. Men are fine with tomboys but they don't want to be in a competition every minute.|`|AA10231477	It depends on how you present yourself. This may seem sexist but unless a guy has a good understanding what really makes him masculine, he may be threatened by a truly athletic woman. You might find a guy that's more emotionally secure. Unfortunately the very reason some of these guys are involved in athletics is because they're compensating for a poor self-image. It's also not a bad thing to be well-rounded as a person. If you are interested in other things, it might help you be more attractive to the opposite sex. Just as it can be boring to always talk about the same thing, it's also somewhat of a downer if a person who has a skill in a certain area presents herself in a competitive mode too much. If you have a tendency to be assertive, but don't demonstrate a softer, more feminine side, at times, you might be doing yourself a disservice. Being strong and athletic is great, but don't forget you're also a young woman, and young men also would like to be around a woman who can act like a lady. <br>  <br>  I have athletic nieces on the olympic level, but they're also undoubtedly feminine and gorgeous. They have to fight off potential suitors. All of them are indeed ladies, while being world-class athletes.<br>  <br>  I see you've responded to some of what I've said. I would definitely find a better class of guy to hang with, then. If you want to be treated like a lady, then find a guy that doesn't mind being a gentleman. Watch how he treats his sisters and his mother. If he's disrespectful to them, he'll do that to you too. He should also have the ability to be more than just a jock.

p2B7vJe7aa	Afer reading your question i got interested into this subject and made a quick research of my own. I found two websites that give more insight:<br>  <br>  1:  <a href="http://www.pakistanpaedia.com/landmarks/badshahi_mosque-lahore.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pakistanpaedia.com/landmarks/...</a><br>  2:  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2165780.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_a...</a><br>  <br>  Part of interest are these quotes":<br>  <br>  BBC: "The shoes are said to have been presented to the emperor Tamerlane on the conquest of Damascus in 1400. They were eventually brought to the sub-continent, along with other relics, in the 16th century, during the early Moghul period. "<br>  <br>  There is talk of Emperor Tamerlane but not who brought them to the sub-continent. <br>  <br>  pakistanpaedia quotes: "In the chambers above the gate of the mosque (above center), are housed relics attributed to Muhammad (PBUH), the Muslims' Holy Prophet, His Daughter and His Son-in-Law and are said to have been brought to the sub-continent by Amir Taimur. Owing to the religious sensitivities and respect, photography of the relics is strictly prohibited."<br>  <br>  It says the relics were brought by Amir Taimur. <br>  <br>  <br>  The obvious link from both websites leads to "Emperor Tamerlane" and his wars against the ottomans and syria. Additionally his tomestone mentions his descent back to Ali (ra) according to the english wiki entry. <br>  <br>  <br>  My conclusion is, either Emperor Timur was really a decendant of Ali (ra) and the relics were in his family and given subsequently to his decendants who then took it over to India or he got hold of them when he looted them in his campaigns against muslim territories and were then taken to India.<br>  <br>  Sorry for not giving you a more definite answer (or myself).Id have to be historian to dig further into this topic. Did you not ask the museums authorities of the origins of the relics. What did they say?|`|AE2iQVKRaa	I do not know how the relics came to Pakistan, but the explanation that was given to you is certainly wrong. Aurangzeb was a Moghul emperor. He was of Mongol descent, and certainly not an Arab. He was the son of Shah Jahan, who built the Taj Mahal in Agra, India.  As far as I know, he never visited Saudi-Arabia.

People's first born were to be dedicated to the Lord, not sacrificed to Him.|`|EBGdlo35aa	Oldguy is correct.  The English words "sacrificed" and "dedicated" are very similar (frequently identical) in Hebrew.  Human sons, like the firstborn (males, presumably) of domesticated animals, were to be sacrificed (dedicated) to God.  However, God specifically allows (in fact, demands) the Jews to redeem their firstborn sons from sacrifice.  They aren't let off that easily, though.  The firstborn *remain* dedicated to God.  Even though their lives have been redeemed from the need for sacrifice, their lives still belong to God - they are supposed to be dedicated to God in a way that is different (more thoroughly dedicated) from that of other Jews.  The firstborn, quite literally, owe their lives to God.  Not just their birth, but their entire lives.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|AA11220299	Humans were not killed as sacrifices. Animals were killed in their place.<br>  <br>  xodus 13:13     "But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every first born of man among your sons you shall redeem.<br>  Exodus 13:15  `It came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed every first born in the land of Egypt, both the first born of man and the first born of beast. Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD the males, the first offspring of every womb, but every first born of my sons I redeem.'|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	He did not command that the firstborn be "sacrificed" (killed). God repeatedly told the Israelites that sacrificing one's children was what the pagans do - but He forbade it. <br>  He DID say that the firstborn were to be "consecrated" to Him, not sacrificed. In the following verse, God condemns those who sacrifice their firstborn:<br>  <br>  Eze 20:26 "And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I [am] the LORD. "<br>  <br>  In the following verse, God says that the firstborn will be called "holy", and that a sacrifice of two birds would be made:<br>  <br>  Luk 2:23 "(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) <br>  <br>  Luk 2:24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Well, when he told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, and when he himself killed the Egyptian firstborn (most of whom had done nothing wrong), he hadn't handed down the commandments yet. In any case, he seems to be a big believer in "Don't do as I do, do as I say."|`|j5YwuVEIaa	“A Thing That I Had Not Commanded”<br>  In sharp contrast with the Israelites, the inhabitants of Canaan offered their children as sacrifices to their gods, including the Ammonite god called Molech, also known as Milcom or Moloch. (1?Kings 11:5, 7, 33; Acts 7:43) Halley’s Bible Handbook says: “Canaanites worshipped, by immoral indulgence, as a religious rite, in the presence of their gods; and then, by murdering their first-born children, as a sacrifice to these same gods.”<br>  Did such practices please Jehovah God? Decidedly not. As the Israelites were about to enter the land of Canaan, Jehovah gave them the command recorded at Leviticus 20:2,?3: “You are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘Any man of the sons of Israel, and any alien resident who resides as an alien in Israel, who gives any of his offspring to Molech, should be put to death without fail. The people of the land should pelt him to death with stones. And as for me, I shall set my face against that man, and I will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his offspring to Molech for the purpose of defiling my holy place and to profane my holy name.’”<br>  Incredible as it may seem, some Israelites who went astray from true worship took up this demonic practice of sacrificing their children to false gods. Regarding this, Psalm 106:35-38 says: “They went mingling with the nations and took up learning their works. And they kept serving their idols, and these came to be a snare to them. And they would sacrifice their sons and their daughters to demons. So they kept spilling innocent blood, the blood of their sons and their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land came to be polluted with bloodshed.”<br>  Expressing his abhorrence of this practice, Jehovah said through his prophet Jeremiah regarding the sons of Judah: “They have set their disgusting things in the house upon which my name has been called, in order to defile it. And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.”—Jeremiah 7:30,?31.<br>  Because of engaging in such disgusting practices, the nation of Israel finally lost God’s favor. Its capital city, Jerusalem, was eventually destroyed, and the people were taken captive to Babylon. (Jeremiah 7:32-34) Clearly, the practice of offering humans in sacrifice is not from the true God and is no part of pure worship. Human sacrifice in any form is demonic, and true worshippers of God stay away from anything that is connected with such a practice.|`|e9bd2b3ace216719e3f2e8f5dde8dfbcaa	And, he takes bribes in the form of human sacrifice.

(Psalm 83:18; John 17:3) The prophet Isaiah recorded God’s own words when he said: “Before me there was no God formed, and after me there continued to be none. I—I am Jehovah, and besides me there is no savior.”—Isaiah 43:10,?11.<br>  All the other gods are not merely inferior to Jehovah. In most cases they are nonexistent—strictly figments of human imagination. The Bible refers to these gods as “the product of the hands of man?.?.?.?, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.” (Deuteronomy 4:28) The Bible plainly teaches that Jehovah is the only true God.<br>  It is no wonder that the Scriptures sternly warn against worshipping any deity other than Jehovah. For instance, in the first of the Ten Commandments given to Moses, the ancient nation of Israel was told not to worship any other god. (Exodus 20:3) Why?<br>  First, to venerate a god that does not even exist is a great insult to the Creator. The worshippers of these false gods are described in the Bible as having “exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created.” (Romans 1:25) Often these imaginary gods are represented by idols made of materials found in nature, such as metal or wood. Many deities are associated with certain aspects of nature, such as thunder, the oceans, and the wind. Surely, then, the veneration of such pseudo gods is a gross act of disrespect to the Almighty God.<br>  To the Creator, false gods and their idols are repugnant. Yet, God’s words of displeasure are mainly directed to the people who have fabricated these false gods. His sentiments are forcefully expressed in these words: “The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of the hands of earthling man. A mouth they have, but they can speak nothing; eyes they have, but they can see nothing; ears they have, but they can give ear to nothing. Also there exists no spirit in their mouth. Those making them will become just like them, everyone who is trusting in them.”—Psalm 135:15-18.<br>  There is another reason for the Bible’s stern warning against worshipping anyone or anything other than Jehovah God. Such worship would be a monumental waste of time and effort. The prophet Isaiah aptly stated: “Who has formed a god or cast a mere molten image? Of no benefit at all has it been.” (Isaiah 44:10) The Bible also says that “all the gods of the peoples are valueless gods.” (Psalm 96:5) False gods are nothing, and worshipping nothing achieves nothing.|`|7ouqu8f4aa	I believe that there is only one God, but groups of people from all around the world all interpreted it the way that they thought suited best, and they spread the word of their beliefs.|`|JAZqgHpGaa	Real ones = zero.<br>  <br>  Ones in peoples' heads = billions.|`|xxyAQOPWaa	1|`|Y5aZesjaaa	Good people=God, depends how much good people there are.|`|LUiiAlsJaa	humans have created millions of them|`|Kg681jL8aa	alot more to count, i believe i made it as one.|`|2wtrPZWraa	anything can be a god, but there is only one true God|`|IiWz11Kraa	Two.

The first of the hymns you mention would at first blush appear to be an ode to one's native land rather than one of praise to the Almighty, but if you continue to examine it, it is a longing for the world to come, when war shall be no more. Jesus said: "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" and this is the sacrifice we are concerned with. <br>  <br>  The verse you cite from "All things bright and beautiful" is usually excluded in these days of social mobility, but they are not objectionable in theological terms, as they suggest that the richer among us should realise that their wealth is God given and to be used properly and the poor realise that their poverty is no reflection of their value in God's sight -- the God Who sent His own Son to live as a poor man among us, and it gives food for thought to those who gauge a person's importance according to wealth.<br>  <br>  And speaking of food -- you know perfectly well the Biblical meaning of "to want", which is to "need". That is the sense in which it always occurs in Scripture. The bread of Heaven is spiritual nourishment which brings satisfaction to the soul. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness -- and there can never be too much of that. But we speak of the God Who also provides for our daily needs.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	its not talking about over eating which is stuffing your self beyond your desire to be full.<br>  <br>  when you eat you are hungry until you get the signal no more i am full.<br>  <br>  that is what the verse is saying feed me until i say stop I am filled.<br>  <br>  it has noting to do with over eating.<br>  <br>  <br>  it also means feed me spiritually until i desire it no more.|`|AA10032971	I do listen to the hymns that I sing. The part about the bread is significant, because God will feed us only until our hunger is satisfied. I know that His rendering to us of 'bread' which may stand for any food, is quite perfect. It makes sense to read and sing only that which gives God the praise. Peace!|`|P5rczL0Saa	I have no clue what "hymn" that first one is.

We do not base our lives on what they say. That would be to lack understanding, to put it mildly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yet so many, as you do, make criticisms and base their life on an equivalent level of understanding and ignorance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Since it is God Who gives understanding in these matters you should rather seek Him and through His word, the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church prohibited the Bible for several hundred years and persecuted and burnt to death those who sought to live by it. Their persecution and savagery was far worse than the Roman Empire's treatment of Christians which has become a byword. They claim unbroken allegiance to those times. Go figure, as they say.<br>  <br>  When you receive from Him and are taught by Him, then you will know.<br>  <br>  You have been confronted, so you are now put upon enquiry.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	You're mixing things up all over the place, things that don't go together. <br>  <br>  First of all, I've never heard that first hymn in my life, and I would never sing it in a church (or anywhere, for that matter). <br>  <br>  Secondly, that second hymn seems fine, and there is no "seven deadly sins".  No such thing.  Only catholicism believes in "seven deadly sins", and catholicism is not Christian.  And gluttony is not a sin.  When Jesus fed the 5,000, it says that all the people were "gluttoned" in the Greek.  Jesus doesn't lead anyone into sin.|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	bread of heaven is SPIRITUAL FOOD.... whats your complaint abot order....

There's one song used in my church that seems to have a Pagan reference, but I am interested in interfaith endeavors and don't mind it. I just think it's interesting that the song has survived with that text all these years.

It makes me roll my eyes anymore.|`|rWP4suXuaa	All the various forms of modern idolatry have one thing at their core: self. We no longer bow down to idols and images. Instead we worship at the altar of the god of self. This brand of modern idolatry takes various forms. <br>  <br>  First, we worship at the altar of materialism which feeds our need to build our egos through the acquisition of more “stuff.” Our homes are filled with all manner of possessions. We build bigger and bigger houses with more closets and storage space in order to house all the things we buy, much of which we haven’t even paid for yet. Most of our stuff has “planned obsolescence” built into it, making it useless in no time, and so we consign it to the garage or other storage space. Then we rush out to buy the newest item, garment or gadget and the whole process starts over. This insatiable desire for more, better, and newer stuff is nothing more than covetousness. The tenth commandment tells us not to fall victim to coveting: "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor" (Exodus 20:17). God doesn’t just want to rain on our buying sprees. He knows we will never be happy indulging our materialistic desires because it is Satan’s trap to keep our focus on ourselves and not on Him. <br>  <br>  Second, we worship at the altar of our own pride and ego. This often takes the form of obsession with careers and jobs. Millions of men—and increasingly more women—spend 60-80 hours a week working. Even on the weekends and during vacations, our laptops are humming and our minds are whirling with thoughts of how to make our businesses more successful, how to get that promotion, how to get the next raise, how to close the next deal. In the meantime, our children are starving for attention and love. We fool ourselves into thinking we are doing it for them, to give them a better life. But the truth is we are doing it for ourselves, to increase our self-esteem by appearing more successful in the eyes of the world. This is folly. All our labors and accomplishments will be of no use to us after we die, nor will the admiration of the world, because these things have no eternal value. As King Solomon put it, “For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun? All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless” (Ecclesiastes 2:21-23). <br>  <br>  Third, we idolize mankind—and by extension ourselves—through naturalism and the power of science. This gives us the illusion that we are lords of our world and builds our self-esteem to godlike proportions. We reject God’s Word and His description of how He created the heavens and the earth, and we accept the nonsense of evolution and naturalism. We embrace the goddess of environmentalism and fool ourselves into thinking we can preserve the earth indefinitely when God has declared the earth has a limited lifespan and will last only until the end of the age. At that time, He will destroy all that He has made and create a new heaven and new earth. “But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness” (2 Peter 3:10-13). As this passage so clearly states, our focus should not be on worshipping the environment, but on living holy lives as we wait eagerly for the return of our Lord and Savior, who alone deserves worship. <br>  <br>  Finally, and perhaps most destructively, we worship at the altar of self-aggrandizement or the fulfillment of the self to the exclusion of all others and their needs and desires. This manifests itself in self-indulgence through alcohol, drugs, and food. Those in affluent countries have unlimited access to alcohol, drugs (prescription drug use is at an all-time high, even among children), and food. Obesity rates in the U.S. have skyrocketed, and childhood diabetes brought on by overeating is epidemic. The self-control we so desperately need is spurned in our insatiable desire to eat, drink, and medicate more and more. We resist any effort to get us to curb our appetites, and we are determined to make ourselves the god of our lives. This has its origin in the Garden of Eden where Satan tempted Eve to eat of the tree with the words “you will be like|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	"the Christian"'s answer is pretty impressive, but he/she forgot the most insidious idolatry of all:  when Christians worship their own too-small idea *about* God instead of God Himself.<br>  <br>  A Christian has to keep in mind that whatever idea he/she has of God, God will always be bigger, better, more mind-bogglingly loving.  So it does us well to stay humble about the motes in eyes of our idol-worshiping brothers and to take care of the timber in our own.

XN0cYCATaa	Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin.

They also may have a fear, real or imagined, that coming out of hte atheist closet will hav ea negative impact on their lives, which it may well do because peopel are so touchy about their god (not someone else's, jsut theirs).<br>  Culture, what your parents and society teach you...its easier to beleive than not to.<br>  Plus...who would not want to believe. Religions aim to answer questions that have no answers.  Why are you here? What happens when you die? Why does stuff happen?<br>  REligion is a really good product...it creates these questions, and then gives you their apparent answer, which is no real answer at all, and is in no way provable or disprovable for certain.<br>  And the other thing, is if you dont beleive, then you arent praying enough. Religion seems to have covered pretty much every angle into ot out of...and the best of all...are the wild cards. <br>  Anytime they dont have an answer to something...play the faith or god card. <br>  In fact, it is unbeleivable how many dicussions I have gotten into with people, and even in teh face of this that and the other "disproving what they beleive", the best phrase is...yeah but I still have faith.<br>  <br>  I also find that the basis of all these religions is history and education...and not to categorically put all religious people together, it is amazing how many peopel are so uneducated as to what the religion is about, how it spread, why it spread, and what it is today and how it got there.<br>  And the way that people will angle stories into fitting god into it is amazing.<br>  <br>  It is human nature for there to be a reason and explanation for things, and when there is not one, I think people will believe what they need to in order to satisfy their desire.|`|6d92de779dfa4089680523ed923076e8aa	I'm a Catholic, but I must say there is so much I hate about orginized religion.

In this age range, children tend to believe what they are taught.  This is a huge evolutionary advantage: "Don't eat those red berries, children, they're poisonous...".

It offers no direct benefit to the individual who holds it.  God has always dictated who holds it and who does not.  <br>  <br>  My personal opinion is that Americans weren't ready for Blacks to be able to have leadership positions over whites in 1830, or 1930 for that matter.

Paul. <br>  <br>  { Titus 2:9-10 }<br>          "Tell slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to talk back, not to pilfer, but to show complete and perfect fidelity, so that in everything they may be an ornament to the doctrine of God our Savior."<br>  <br>  ( Ephesians 6: 5-8 }<br>          "Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as you obey Christ; not only while being watched, and in order to please them, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.  Render service with enthusiasm, as to the Lord and not to men and women, knowing that whatever good we do, we will receive the same again from the Lord, whether we are slaves or free."<br>  <br>  ( 1 Cor. 7: 21--24 }<br>          "Were you a slave when called?  Do not be concerned about it.  Even if you can gain your freedom, make use of your present condition now more than ever.  For whoever was called in the Lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the Lord, just as whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ.  You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of human masters.  In whatever condition you were called, brothers and sisters, there remain with God."<br>  <br>  ( 1 Tim. 6:1-5 }<br>          "Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed.  Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them on the ground that they are members of the church; rather they must serve them all the more, since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved.  Teach and urge these duties.<br>          Whoever teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness, is conceited, understanding nothing, and has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words.  From these come envy, dissension, slander, base suspicions, and wrangling among those who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth."|`|O3Pmwaruaa	I agree that Joseph Smith's doctrine did not come from god.

A Mormon leader, yes, but much later, and not the same person. Just thought you might want to know. He didn't start it all.<br>  There is reason to everything, we believe. Black people now are so much stronger and more resilient than the Africans the slave handlers once captured and put to slavery. Sometimes scarily so (the infamous black woman's anger = terror-inducing). <br>  What J.F. Smith is saying, there is a reason why everyone was born with differences. Don't your shortcomings make you stronger? You shouldn't base your opinions on what only he says. It's like taking one politician seriously, you have to have a balanced view. People are human, after all.<br>  We believe that people are black because of the Mark of Cain. Black people aren't bad, actually in the Book of Mormon, Lamanites (the marked people, bad generally) were often the good guys. There were many black Mormons before they were allowed to be priests. And we believe that Mormon leaders have prayed continuously during time to ask for equal rights, and around the 70's, God granted them.<br>  And you know, many religions segregate women (that's a larger prejudice, why isn't that confronted?) women's rights have been granted, but in religion, that's still an issue. Civil rights for any prejudiced people and religious rights are entirely different. There is no connection, merely a coincidence.<br>  There's a reason for everything. No where does it say in the bible that women can't be priests because Eve ate the fruit. Adam ate the fruit also. Women are created to be the nurturing side and men the strong. There is balance to the world God created. Men are generally leaders, women the mothers and teachers. Doesn't mean society should mete out the civil rights unequally, though.<br>  <br>  To Capt CB up there, you do realize that polygamy was everywhere, not just in the Mormon church. When the gov't put an end to it, so did the Mormon church. We aren't supportive of the Fundamental Mormons who decided to keep it up. It started when Mormon men (husbands) were killed in war with the gov't and God told Joseph that able men should take up additional wives to support them and their children, lest they die from lack of shelter, food, support, etc. It was meant to be temporary, but some people have taken a liking to it, and the LDS church does not support them. And those missionaries? They're 19 yr old boys leaving home for 2 yrs to serve the church they strongly believe in. And they have to pay their way through it. So quit giving them a rough time, they're only trying to spread the gospel of Jesus, not attack you in spiritual debates. They're only human too after all.|`|RkysBrVwaa	it's evident that you don't know much about the LDS church or it's history since right off the bat you say "since Racism was around the time of Joe Smith, and he didn't allow blacks until the 70's when equal rights and stuff came around" first joesph smith ALLOWED blacks to have the priesthood. brigham young was the one who said that they were not allowed when holding the priesthood allowed for higher duties. such as giving blessings to the sick etc. smith was very against segregation and slavery and spoke out against it MANY many times. Even wrote a speech how black people DO have souls which was something that other churches were teaching that they did NOT have. He got A LOT of heat for it. Also ran for president on an anti slavery campaign. so right away it shows that you are pretty uninformed on the actual subject and probably shouldn't be drawing conclusions based on your false information.<br>   Also being a bishop is not the same has holding the priesthood. And in the new testament Jesus extends it to the Gentiles as well through revelation to paul. So basing your thoughts of whether or not it's from God based on whether those that hold it are Jew or Greek isn't the best of arguments either...|`|FDVuAiHOaa	As solid as air.<br>  <br>  I gues we're ignoring the fact that women can't become Catholic priests...|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Sure. And since the bible treats women and gays as inferior, it's proof it's not from God either.
yQNit56Qaa	1) why do people say catholics got rid of the 2nd commandment?<br>  <br>  Ignorance.  However, it *is* understandable ignorance.  The Roman Catholics show **3** sets of "10 commandments".  The first, longer version from Exodus is the one (and only one) used by those who claim this.  The second appears in Deuteronomy.  The third is a simplified form (for the purpose of education) based on Deuteronomy.  You can look here and see why those who look only to Exodus (on the left) deem something to be missing in the "Catechetical Formula" (CF).  The problem is, that "something" is also missing from Deuteronomy, upon which the CF is based.  The truth is that the Roman Catholics no more omit the 2nd commandment than does the author of Deuteronomy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a3.htm#ten" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/...</a><br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|AA10034051	We didnt, they are just numbered different<br>  <br>  <br>  1.You shall have no other gods before me.<br>  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

As they got close to the gate of the city, they met up with a funeral procession. The deceased was a young man. His mother was a widow, and he had been her only son, so now she was all alone. According to the record, Jesus “was moved with pity for her, and he said to her: ‘Stop weeping.’ With that he approached and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still, and he said: ‘Young man, I say to you, Get up!’ And the dead man sat up and started to speak.”—Luke 7:11-15.<br>  IT IS a heartwarming story, but is it true? Many find it hard to believe that such things ever really happened. Nevertheless, miracles are an integral part of the Bible record. Belief in the Bible means believing that miracles occurred. In fact, the whole pattern of Bible truth depends on one very important miracle: the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  Why Some Do Not Believe<br>  2 Do you believe in miracles? Or do you feel that in this scientific age, it is illogical to believe in miracles—that is, in extraordinary events that give evidence of superhuman intervention? If you do not believe, you are not the first. Two centuries ago, the Scottish philosopher David Hume had the same problem. It may be that your reasons for disbelief are similar to his.<br>  3 Hume’s objections to the idea of miracles included three outstanding points.1 First, he writes: “A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature.” Man has relied from time immemorial on the laws of nature. He has known that an object will fall if it is dropped, that the sun will rise each morning and set each night, and so forth. Instinctively, he knows that events will always follow such familiar patterns. Nothing will ever happen that is out of harmony with natural laws. This ‘proof,’ Hume felt, “is as entire as any argument from experience” against the possibility of miracles.<br>  4 A second argument he presented was that people are easily fooled. Some want to believe in marvels and miracles, especially when it has to do with religion, and many so-called miracles have turned out to be fakes. A third argument was that miracles are usually reported in times of ignorance. The more educated people become, the fewer miracles are reported. As Hume expressed it, “Such prodigious events never happen in our days.” Thus, he felt it proved that they never did happen.<br>  5 To this day, most arguments against miracles follow these general principles, so let us consider Hume’s objections, one by one.<br>  Against the Laws of Nature?<br>  6 What about the objection that miracles are ‘violations of the laws of nature’ and therefore cannot be true? On the surface, this might seem persuasive; but analyze what is really being said. Usually, a miracle can be defined as something that occurs outside the normal laws of nature. It is an occurrence so unexpected that onlookers are convinced they have witnessed superhuman intervention. Hence, what the objection really means is: ‘Miracles are impossible because they are miraculous!’ Why not consider the evidence before jumping to such a conclusion?<br>  7 The truth is, educated people today are less prepared than was David Hume to insist that the familiar laws of nature hold true everywhere and at all times. Scientists are willing to speculate on whether, instead of the familiar three dimensions of length, breadth, and height, there may be many additional dimensions in the universe.2 They theorize on the existence of black holes, huge stars that collapse in on themselves until their density is virtually infinite. In their vicinity the fabric of space is said to be so distorted that time itself stands still.3 Scientists have even debated whether, under certain conditions, time would run backward instead of forward!4<br>  8 Stephen W.?Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, when discussing how the universe began, said: “In the classical theory of general relativity .?.?. the beginning of the universe has to be a singularity of infinite density and space-time curvature. Under such conditions, all the known laws of physics would break down.”5 So, modern scientists do not agree that because something is contrary to the normal laws of nature it can never happen. In unusual conditions, unusual things may happen. Surely, if we believe in an almighty God, we should admit that he has the power to cause unusual—miraculous—events to take place when it befits his purpose.—Exodus 15:6-10; Isaiah 40:13,?15.<br>  What About the Fakes?<br>  9 No reasonable person would deny that there are fake miracles. For example, some claim the power to heal the sick by miraculous faith healing. A medical doctor, William A.?Nolan, made it his special project to investigate such healings. He followed up on numerous claimed cures among both evangelical faith healers in the United

Bqoydq1Oaa	I'm sorry that the priest at the church your parents attend said all of this, and does not teach from the Bible.<br>  If you look at history (from secular textbooks even) the Church in the Bible is the Catholic Church, and later on denominations broke away from this Church. This is the church that decided which books would be a part of the Bible, so how could Church teachings be unbliblical?<br>   Masses are supposed to have 3 Bible readings on Sundays, and the homily is based on the Gopsel reading. Also, I'm sorry your priest didn't give you good answers about idolatry. We should not blindly believe.<br>  Maybe your parents should switch churches? It does not sound very Catholic. <br>  <br>  Anyways, in answer to your questions:<br>  1) Catholics should not be worshiping images, that IS indeed idolatry. I hope that no one is worshiping a statue or image. Images respresent the people on them. It's like having a photo of family, statues of famous people. Is that considered idolatry too? <br>  2) I agree 100% with the scripture above. Only God should be worshiped. It is one of the Ten Commandments. It's good that you pointed this out, reading the Bible is a good thing. (:<br>  3) The Catholic Church put together the New Testament and was the first Church, before there were Protestants. I believe that Sola scriptura, solo scriptura, faith alone etc, are traditions of man. No where is it mentioned in the Bible. The traditions passed down through the Catholic Church was directly from the apostles, whom Jesus entrusted His teachings to. St Peter was the first pope. Jesus said that He would build His church on the rock, Peter, and that Jesus would be the cornerstone. (Matt 16:18-20), and that the gates of Hades (death) would not destroy it. After Peter died physically, someone else would take on this role. That's apostolic succession.<br>  <br>  4) Priests are people. It's extremely unfortunate that they are atheists or have done things to children, and the Church does not condone this. Just because an American murders a bunch of people doesn't make all Americans evil. Just because an atheist starts a charity does not mean all atheists are charitible. People are people. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped. If not, please add details. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm arguing here either. I'm glad you are interested in having these questions answered. <br>  <br>  God bless.|`|RoYL4tyjaa	my parents go to church but the priest does not teach ANYTHING that's on the bible<br>  <br>  <br>  gee thats funny what is that big book he reads from that has the name Bible on it..and glasses.. <br>  <br>  maybe your parents should get hearing aids...<br>  <br>  The Last time I checked they worship one God they say this at mass every sunday<br>  <br>  I believe in God,<br>  the Father Almighty,<br>  Creator of Heaven and earth. <br>  <br>  I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,<br>  who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br>  born of the Virgin Mary,<br>  suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>  was crucified, died and was buried.<br>  He descended to the dead.<br>  On the third day, He rose again.<br>  He ascended to Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>  He will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br>  <br>  I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>  the Holy Catholic Church,<br>  the communion of saints,<br>  the forgiveness of sins,<br>  the resurrection of the body,<br>  and life everlasting.

The Maronite Rite of the Catholic church still sings some of their hymns in Aramaic.<br>  <br>  It's okay to question because sometimes you get good answers, and sadly sometimes we make decisions based only on our limited knowledge (because we are finite beings and not beings who lived at the time of Christ.)  Please take into account these things and many others besides.<br>  <br>  For instance, the early Christians did make and paint images of Jesus, Mary and the apostles, because when the catacombs in Rome were dug up, there were many frescos dating to the time of the era of martyrdom (0-300AD) attributed to the early Christians.<br>  <br>  The early Christians had no problems with images.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Have you ever seen any Catholic bow down and WORSHIP an inanimate object??  That is ridiculous, especially considering the teaching of the Catholic Church absolutely condemns idolatry in every form as "incompatible with Christian life".  You can find this in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, under "idolatry".  Priests are sinners just like the rest of us.  No-one claims otherwise.  So were the apostles.  Crimes against children are no more common among priests than among any other large group of men, and slightly LESS common than similar crimes among Protestant clergy.  How could anything in the Bible confclit with Catholic teaching when the Catholic Church compiled the Bible??  Do you seriously think they included things in their own book that confclited with their own teaching??  With all due respect, you have no way of knowing what the Bible actually says since you have no means of authoritative interpretation - a fact that is obvious from the doctrinal chaos of Protestantism.  One thing the Bible DOES say is that Christ intended that there would be ONE Church.  Proterstantism exists in open defiance of the will of Christ.  How could you expect to find truth in a tradition that contradicts the will of God by its very existence?|`|ulwXFrrJaa	what bible are you using?  <br>  <br>  you do know that Catholics and Protestants use a different Bible, right?

These are works of art.  They remind us of people that we consider holy and good.  The crucifix reminds us of the great love that Jesus had for us.  <br>  <br>  Catholics agree with the verse you quoted.  We are not to worship graven images.  <br>  <br>  Catholics follow the Bible and the rules of men that were called by God to shepherd us - priests, bishops, and cardinals.   If you are honest, ou will admit that you also follow your minister.  <br>  <br>  Priests that admit they are atheists should ask to be relieved of their duties as priests.<br>  <br>  Priests that are accused of molesting children are removed from public ministry while the case is investigated.

I don't know what you were taught growing up (it doesn't sound very much), but you really should go and find out more about your own religion (ie Catholicism) before looking elsewhere.  I'm not saying that you won't come to the same conclusions, but you don't understand what Catholicism is about, and it will always be an issue for you until you actually *do* understand.<br>  <br>  Priests are only human - I've met priests who I'm sure were very holy, but who I just didn't relate to.  I've met others who were real inspirations.  Priests are only human - they have failings and personalities like anyone else.  Honestly - go to a few different catholic churches and find a priest you like, then go to him, explain your problems and put all your questions to him.  He will answer your questions much better than we can.  But he has to be one that you can relate to otherwise you'll just find yourself disagreeing with him on principle.  It's good to have questions, and he should be one who can appreciate your interest in the subject - whatever the outcome.<br>  <br>  *then*, when you _know_ what you're rejecting, you can go off and find out about other religions and reject Catholicism if that's what you feel you must do.|`|AA11521494	I'm not catholic but I understand some of this.

Catholicism IS about the power of the priesthood, or at least it always used to be.  It does follow the bible, but as I say, it's own traditions as well.

You're being stuck up. The guy is probably making eye contact with you. So, being the too good for men, you turn your head. So, the guy is responding you in a polite way. Every men are different. When i approach a woman, and i make eye conatct and smile, and she stick her nose up, and turn her head, i don't spit at her, ohhh no. I just go pfft and say BERMP!!!!!......NEXT!!!!!!!|`|sqnHdaZCaa	i think it is just a thing men do it is nothing to cause offence to you because i spit alot its just a build up of phlem most of the time <br>  <br>  it is meant of no offence to you|`|uXWbOhDcaa	You are so hot you make them drool and spitting is man's way of ridding themselves of excess saliva<br>  Don't think too much|`|3dfqWqYwaa	that is strange. maybe they are just spitting a luggie, and u are the one that just is always coincidentally there when they decide to cough one up, I would not pay any mind to it.|`|yJ2xmpJ5aa	Coz u is one ugly hoe i would spit at u|`|hLohtlPEaa	You must be very attractive to have someone salivate so much that they have to spit.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Some people just have no class.
HVqkJD83aa	I run the self check at a grocery store, and unfortunately there is no item limit at this one. It angers me, the people checking out, and of course, the people behind them. Why bother?<br>  <br>  Also, I was working at the regular ten items or less lane yesterday, when I was interrupted from my current customer because someone got in my line with a giant cart full of crap and the pcustomer behind them said something. <br>  <br>  I'm not allowed to say anything, you know "the customer is always right" and all that crap.<br>  <br>  Her response was, I'm a customer just like everyone else.<br>  <br>  Does being a customer make you more important. Are you illiterate. What?<br>  <br>  I just know I hate being at express.|`|AA12320776	I can't stand when the person does that and looks back of you like the have the right!

I find that if you get behind someone with a full cart in the regular check line, it seems to move much faster.|`|WuhIoS1laa	In my supermarket, those lights can be turned off and on just like the lane lights. <br>  <br>  I've been in a line that flipped off express while I was there and all the people behind me with the big carts rushed over. I've also had clerks see me in the end of the regular line and tell me to come on over to the empty express lane rather than wait on a longer regular lane. <br>  <br>  If you are sure none of this applies then they are just inconsiderate.
AA10202389	Religion has several definitions, not necessarily requiring a higher power. Science is some peoples higher power, so the current definition is just the most popular one now. Christianity was Catholic and Protestantism was also man's commentary on scriptures and is traditions of men. The scribes and Pharisees also had their views, commentaries and interpretations. We are just used to being told that the denominations are true, but they are really men's definitions and traditions and interpretations. <br>  It's too bad people follow religions rather than the Bible. Doesn't seem right to me. Just because Martin Luther or Pope somebody says it, how is that anything but letting someone else think for you? Man, talk about an anti-Christ. I guess we've had plenty. I haven't heard anyone yet say they've read the whole Bible on there own without using someone else's interpretation. We are so used to following leaders and look where they lead. Will we never learn? <br>  Few of those commentators said that God told them what it meant or had visions, revelations or angels talking to them. They did an excellent job of translating and picking the books that matched to make a coherent whole, but that doesn't make them infallible. They don't even say that, at least not straight out. Besides, these are end times and there are scriptures specifically for that. Joel says that no one will have to tell them about God and that His spirit will be poured out on everyone. Is it possible it's now? Not that all the interpretations of the Bible are accurate, but everyone is sure looking into scriptures and even science is getting into the act with the scientific method.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	I've heard a great definition about religion that I agree with.  "Religion is man's efforts to reach out to a deity with the hopes of gaining favor or removing misfortune."   It usually requires works, ritual, sacrifice, or striving in order to be saved/blessed/advanced in the next life, etc.  <br>  <br>  What I believe is that the one true creator God reaches out to us for a loving, personal relationship.  He offers His peace, wisdom, rest, protection, salvation, etc. if we want it.|`|OncdpDunaa	Two of the greatest statements in life about religion came from Jesus himself:<br>  <br>  "Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducee's, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: 'Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?' Jesus replied, "Love the Lord you God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest cocommandmentAnd the second is like it, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two cocommandments    Matthew 22: 34-37<br>  <br>  Religion in our society has turned into a secular term, or lalabelFor me, religion means, following the rituals, rights, vivirtuesand traditions of a church. Being an active part in all things within the church.<br>  <br>  I don't like the term "So, what religion are you?" I'm not. I follow Christ and I am spiritual. I've bee to many churches that I cannot find the Holy Spirit in. Churches that actually feel like negative things are happening within. I love the Lord and the Lord loves me. I live my life according to what He needs me to do. Everyday is different but everyday is a blessing. God Bless|`|nHizaTiDaa	The Pharisees were super-religious.  Yet Jesus said their hearts were far from God.<br>  <br>  They prayed- a lot.  They tithed, to the penny! They did all the right kosher things.  <br>  <br>  But yet Jesus said they were white-washed sepulchers.<br>  <br>  God wants us- to be pure from inside out. Not just an outward "reformation" but God wants to give us Christ and then he does transformation of us from the inside.<br>  <br>  This is not religion.  This is life in Christ.

We all just want to take, and not give anything back, and very often we are using and exploiting everybody else whether we talk about personal life or relationships in between nations, countries, etc.<br>  But at the same time we can also see, that the world has become global, interconnected. We are basically physically one big family now, chained together in every aspect of life.<br>  If we really understood these two concepts about our own behavior and our interconnected nature, the solution is almost automatic.<br>  And it can be done by ourselves.<br>  Who knows, if we managed to build a new human society based on new, giving and loving attitudes, we could even reveal something beyond our present perception, something we all so want to find.<br>  Sorry for the long answer, all the best.|`|ggjSKphZaa	I find that "no god" is the obvious answer.

UWlRLXvRaa	So we can understand the scriptures and Jesus' words apart from the Holy Spirit with our limited brain power and human reasoning alone?<br>  <br>  Maybe you're not saying that but it sounds like it. It sounds like you're saying we need to put our faith in the reason abilities of man verses the Holy Spirit. Maybe you're not but if we could understand the scriptures apart from revelations directly from the Spirit, then why would Jesus send Him? Why would He see the need for Him to come and "teach us all things and bring to our rememberance the words of Jesus? (John 14:26) Why is He still here?<br>  <br>  God said through Isaiah (55:8-9),<br>  <br>  "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, <br>         neither are your ways my ways," <br>         declares the LORD. <br>  <br>  "As the heavens are higher than the earth, <br>         so are my ways higher than your ways <br>         and my thoughts than your thoughts."<br>  <br>  That's why having the Holy Spirit help us understand God's words is not only 'nice' it's essencial! Apart from the Holy Spirit we can know nothing! The Jews of old had their Torrah and they still needed prophets, inspired by the Holy Spirit to help them understand it. Peter and Paul had the whole Old Testament and it was the Holy Spirit who gave them directly revelations about the gospel being for the Gentiles too.<br>  <br>  As for Spirit filled Christians getting different answers from the orginal apostles, I think that is quite probable. Why? <br>  <br>  1). 1 Cor.13:9  "For we know in part and we prophesy in part," Some hear from the Holy Spirit just a part and they preach and teach only that part. Their hearing is limited and immature.<br>  <br>  2). Not all the authors of the gospels are exact in their presentations of the accounts which took place. Why? Because different personalities see the same occurances differently and that is good. Yes, they came to an overall unity and agreement which is lacking in many of today's church. However, like today, they had divisions and conflicts too. Remember Paul and Barnabas?<br>  <br>  3). Many people/denominations put a period after what they believe verses a coma. Some quit in the learning process. They stop at "3rd grade" in their understanding and study of the scripture,(much to the dismay to the Holy Spirit) while others continue onto "grad. school."<br>  <br>  4). No one hears the voice of the Spirit perfectly. At times, everyone of us mistakes our own voices or the even the voices of the devil or the world for the Holy Spirit's. This happens from time to time to everyone, not just those of the renewal movements. And God allows it because it's the main way we learn to hear His voice. No one walks perfectly when they're a toddler, everyone falls sometimes but if they don't take a step because they're afraid to fall, they'll never learn to walk. And the more you do it, the better at it you become.<br>  <br>  5). Some refuse to let go of their settled, inacurate theological viewpoints and realign them to the correct ones. Why? Because it shakes their sense of security. Many find security in being right and when they find out their wrong, it shakes them to their very core. That's why some will resist the truth time and time again after many proofs and Divine experiences.<br>  6). Almost all denominations are resistant to a truth that God has restored to another denomination. For example, many Catholics are resistant to the teachings of Martin Luther. They don't have room in their hearts for God's revealed word/truth that the Holy Spirit showed Martin Luther. And some Lutherans and other Protestants in their frustration of the stubbornness of many Catholics (or any other previous denomination that God used to restore a truth of scripture)have thrown out the good Catholic baby (truths)with the bad Catholic bathwater (falsehoods). They notice something that the previous denomination believed that was false so they close their ears to hearing the truth of that denomination.<br>  <br>  Should all revelations from the Holy Spirit agree or are there multiple truths?<br>  In essence, yes they should all agree because they are true, if they are truly from the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit isn't skitzo. But the problem is we are limited and stubborn. We accept somethings from Him and reject other things. And sometimes, we say "This is God's truth, when it isn't. It's just our thinking and/or wanting it to be. Thankfully, that doesn't cause the Holy Spirit to resign His position of being our Teacher. He is very kind and patient. And He is faithful to finish what He started in us.<br>  <br>  I do fear the person who rarely opens up the Bible and studies it and just relies on what the Spirit is telling them because no one can hear Him perfectly. However, those that seek to understand the scriptures apart from the Holy Spirit are just as dangerous as the former. Both end up in a ditch - just opposite ditches.|`|sd6vzmF1aa	All believers are Spirit-filled, Bruce. Romans 8:9 says, "But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, since the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him."<br>  <br>  Now as for the question of different fallen human beings, still clinging to the Old Man, coming up with imperfect interpretations, one answer should more than satisfy.<br>  <br>  That answer is "sin."  It will be wonderful at last, when we are in our future glorified bodies, to look at the Scriptures in Heaven with those eyes.<br>  <br>  Somehow I think the whole of it will boil down to one central theme, one that will fit Catholic and Protestant Christians alike, "Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves!"|`|um9W8Dy8aa	The Holy Spirit is the same now and then and forever and there can only be one Christian fullness of truth and not many contradictory ones|`|p6wwiQG3aa	They can't.....however our understanding of the apostles teachings sometimes come from bad preaching by men to people who don't check out the bible to see if it's true<br>  <br>  "it must be true, my pastor said so!" is the clarion call of the ignorant Christian|`|32xRsYa9aa	I don't think they do. I think that the personal revelations that are available to us today are generally misunderstood, being translated in the context of our current world view. <br>  In order to truly hear from the Spirit, one must be attuned to the Spirit, and this rarely happens today, and when it does, to varying degrees. There are few who will submit to the leading of the Spirit, as this is something foreign, and unpracticed today, save for a few brave souls. <br>  I just finished reading a story about a man who received provision from Yahweh to accomplish a task the Spirit set before him which he was unable to do in the natural. As I read it, I did not imagine it was beyond the power of God to do, but I am sure that it would be received by many as spiritual hocus-pocus. This is the state of our condition with regards to the Creator. We believe to the point of being uncomfortable, or stepping beyond the bounds of what is possible, and again, put God in a convenient little box, to remove when our need is great. This attitude tends to be it's own reward. These are those that will be lacking in the coming days in the wilderness. <br>  I hope you understand this, and I pray you are walking with your eyes wide open. Be well.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Well they may think there spirit filled but Christ told his Apostles they and his Church would receive the Holy spirit to Guide his Church and protect it from error. The Bible says GOD is not the Author of confusion and with all these different beliefs from the Bible and all them claiming there being guided by the Holy Spirit. I just can not believe GOD turned his teachings he left with the Apostles open to all these various interpretations i mean GOD just would not have a interpretation free for all.|`|vAbATcTcaa	it depends on who they have ears to hear.<br>  Jesus told us in the bible and is recorded as him saying to us that when he was speaking to his apostles he said whoever hears YOU, hears ME< and whosoever rejects YOU rejects ME>|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	There is one truth, but people may relate to them differently. However, two people who "hear" from the Holy Spirit should not be saying something that contradicts one another or Scripture.

Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and TAKE THESE WORDS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE PRESENT HERE TODAY.<br>  O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...<br>  Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.<br>  O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.<br>  O People, listen to me in earnest, worship ALLAH, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.<br>  All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.<br>  Remember, one day you will appear before ALLAH and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.<br>  O People, NO PROPHET OR APOSTLE WILL COME AFTER ME AND NO NEW FAITH WILL BE BORN. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the QURAN and my example, the SUNNAH and if you follow these you will never go astray.<br>  All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly.

Haha a lot of time people reply with "I know, it only cost me" or "I know I love it" but this does strangely seem somewhat rude lol|`|AA11160607	Society wants you to say thank you. You are right, we didn't make the shirt or sweater. That's what's wrong. People go by what Society tells them. Society tells you should compliment, Society tells you should hold a door for a woman, etc. Just once, go against what Society tells you, and you will gain respect. When someone tells you that's a nice shirt you have on. Instead of saying thank you, just roll your eyes and say pffft. It will keep them in suspense. They will be confused at first.|`|929b0210e46cbd96484f7032e99a63afaa	Their compliment on your clothing is really a compliment on your taste, your eye for style. You say "thank you" because they have acknowledged something positive about you :) <br>  <br>  Best Regards,<br>  Holly|`|3dfqWqYwaa	Really? It is just a way of complimenting you when they say "cool shirt" it is just common courtesy|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	Because if we didnt say thank you then that would sound really rood and the person who said it would think your stuck up, thats just the way it is. lol

Redheads are known to have a wicked temper, so I think macho guys are afraid that the temper may flair up in their face if all doesn't go right..<br>  Plus it seems the majority of the girls all want to be that "drop dead" gorgeous blonde - and we all know, that doesn't always work out..<br>  Brunettes are fine, but    I guess you might say "middle of the road" as many a time they're not happy with their "color" and they don't want to go blonde, and black is a bit "harsh", so it's a "what to - what to do" situation.<br>  With redheads - it's a thing of "X" - THE UNKNOWN - so best steer clear - just in case..<br>  Hope this explains my feelings on being a redhead" and why<br>  Regards,<br>  Rachelle In High Heels|`|pB55nws3aa	Red hair is beautiful...and most redheads are pretty good-looking.|`|JjYXy2oqaa	I am so jealous of red heads.<br>  <br>  I might be converting (;|`|sN8aqb95aa	Personally, no.<br>  They are attractive in their own way, but i normally look at people independently, with the features of what they have done to make them look pretty.

2FNfyxVqaa	This is a tough one. Honestly, they're both important in their own ways. It's important to go to the bachelorette party to celebrate her soon to be getting married and to be a good friend. But your boyfriend really needs you by his side and a death is a more serious issue than a party. On the other hand, i'd rather be happy than be depressed... BUT think about it, i understand he wasn't close to her, but how would you feel if he, being your boyfriend, didn't support you and go to a funeral of a family  member? You would feel betrayed and feel like that's what a bf or gf is for to stand by you in time of need.<br>  The only option I can think of is to go to both. Go to the funeral then after that go to the party since it is all night. ABout the money, I would say pre-game. Which basically if you're worried about money for drinks and stuff, buy a bottle before you guys go out and that way you wont' spend IN the club. And also, don't spend a lot for entry to the club...and if they plan to go to more than one club then just go to the first one then let them know you're broke. It happens to all of us so she shouldn't be upset.<br>  This way, you have been there for you boyfriend and you went to celebrate with your friend. Even if you're not there all night what counts is that you made an effort to go and showed your face. Don't stress it too much though
cDZJgM4jaa	Stupid people think that the money they have was earned and people who don't have money are at fault.|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	A lot of people think like that.

oVeGMNsLaa	Don't feel stupid.  Lots of people don't even know the words you're using, so you're a step ahead of the game!<br>  <br>  1) Assuming the surgeon was good and there were no complications, the vagina from a vaginoplasty will be completely sensate.  The sensitive skin of the penis becomes the new walls of the vagina, so when the nerve endings are reconnected, it can be felt.  It can feel good, definitely.  As for muscular control, yes, they can have it.    Most people assume that there is such thing as vaginal muscles, but in fact there's no such thing- the vagina is not a muscle, but empty space surrounded by pelvic muscles.  Men have pelvic muscles as well, and once the space is created, they can squeeze it in the same way that women can tighten their vaginal cavities.<br>  <br>  2) Same place it did before- the urethra.  It's just shorter now.<br>  <br>  3) Phalloplasties do not get erect on their own, because the tissue it's made out of is not corpus cavernosum, which is sponge-like and becomes erect when filled with blood, like penises and clitorises.  Stimulation of the new penis will make the brain send bloodflow to the genitals, but because the type of tissue isn't the same, it simply won't get hard.  Transmen usually get an implant in their hip and the penis, the same kind that impotent non-trans men get, that can allow them to get an instant erection and lose it at the press of a button.  And yes, again, assuming that the surgery went well, there is sensation.<br>  <br>  4) It depends on how it's done.  Sometimes the men choose to simply urinate the same way as they always have done.  Other times, the urethra can be lengthened and re-routed through the new penis . . . but it's a procedure fraught with complications.|`|65QqZBnjaa	1. A man doesn't have a vaginoplasty, a transsexual women does!  Yes, yes and yes.<br>  <br>  2. Same place yours does!<br>  <br>  3. A woman doesn't get a phalloplasty a transsexual man does!  Limited functionality.  A lot more research needs to be done before the surgery for the guys comes close to how good the surgery is for the girls.  As a result most guys do not get bottom surgery.  With phalloplasty you need an implanted rod and pump to achieve and erection.<br>  <br>  4 Depends.  If they don't get bottom surgery: same as you.  If they get a metoidioplasty with a urethral extension, they can be standing up with their small micropenis.  If they have a phalloplasty with urethral extension, they pee standing up just like other guys.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	First of all, if someone is having a vaginoplasty, do not call them men. They are women, or transwomen/MtFs if they so choose to identify. If someone is having a phalloplasty, then they are men, or transmen/FtMs. People don't go through painful, expensive surgeries like that because they "really are men" or "really are women".<br>  <br>  With that out of the way...<br>  <br>  1. If an transwoman has a vaginoplasty, there is sensation in the vagina and it works as a vagina should, assuming nothing goes wrong and the body recovers as it should.<br>  <br>  2. The doctors re-route the urethra to a proper position for a female.<br>  <br>  3. If a transman has a phalloplasty, unless there are other things done to make it such, the penis is usually not functional like a penis usually would be. It doesn't become erect, though there usually is sensation and people can have a fairly normal sex life with some other aids. Alas, bottom surgery for FtMs isn't nearly as good as bottom surgery for MtFs.<br>  <br>  4. The urethra is re-routed through the new penis.<br>  <br>  Though honestly, you could just look up "sex reassignment surgery" on Google and find tons of information.

qG4ozrH1aa	No I do not believe in evolution. Why? Simple. In the Precambrian layer there is No life, but in the Cambrian all of the sudden you have a profusion of all kinds of life forms. Funny how that 'just happened to happen' don't you think? Oh, yea, those life forms were fully formed, not a single 'missing link' or pre-life form among the lot of them. Nothing that was becoming a (for example) fish, or monkey, or human, or tiger or anything else. They were just there, fully formed and complete. That is one reason why I believe in the literal creation of this world. The other is because God said so. You may not like that reason, but that is neither here nor there for me.|`|AA12193600	"i think it's crap" is based on personal opinion and religious belief and not objective evidence.  If we were to evaluate evolution and creationism based on objective evidence, evolution is the accepted process.  You can "think" what ever you wish--opinion and $1.00 will buy you a cup of coffee in most gas stations.  Objective evaluation of the facts and intellectual honesty will get you published in a reputable journal--sadly something creationists have never been able to do.  They can't get past the fact that their hypothesis is falsifiable.|`|LF4vun1maa	So you think evolution is crap.<br>  <br>  Can you describe the principles of the theory of evolution in your own words?

Evolution is not a fact, it's a theory.<br>  When you look at the complexity of the humans body and other life, the complexity of the earth and its ecosystem, and the order of the universe, it points to intelligent design not unending series of accidents.<br>  In order of me to claim that there is no God, I have to know everything there is to know and if we are honest we know that humans know very little about the universe in which we live.<br>  The odds of evolution occurring is beyond impossible.  14 billion years does not allow enough time for evolution to even get a start.<br>  The rate at which the sun shrinks daily is evident that the sun cannot be 5 billion years old, for the earth would have been swallowed up.  It also tells us that the sun will not last another 5 billion years.<br>  Evolution violates the laws of thermodynamics:<br>  1st law (energy conservation) states that although energy can change forms, it cannot be either created or destroyed, therefore remains constant.    <br>  2nd law (energy deterioration) when energy is transformed from one state to another, some of it is turned into heat energy and cannot be converted back into useful forms.  Like a wound up clock the universe is winding down.<br>  The 3rd law (biogensis) says life produces simular life.<br>  Time is not the friend of evolution but it's greatest foe.  <br>  The fossil evidence does not support evolution, no legitimate transitional fossils have been found.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	no i do not believe in evolution, i accept it based on the evidence provided.<br>  <br>  Science is not about looking for an answer you like.  it's about looking for the best possible explanation that fits the observable data you have.

(Matt 6:24)<br>  <br>  This does not mean that I am intentionally going to defy the laws of the land in my participation of the political arena, but in my obedience to those laws, I will not forsake God.  In the words of Joshua; "... as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD." <br>  <br>  Obedience to God must come first, last, and always.|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	What percentage should politics play in our walk with God?<br>  <br>  My first thought was A. 0%  because our faith should permeate every aspect of our lives not the other way around.<br>  <br>  But when I think about it more, God gave man government to rule over us and we are to be subject to the governing authorities.  Even more importantly, we are to thoughtfully and carefully pick and choose the ones we want in office from the guidelines He has given to us.  So I guess it would have to be equally divided or else have it like Jesus with His deity and humanity .... 100% for both.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	F     We are called to be in the world but not of it, and to give to Caesar what is his, and God what is God's.

Which you can't, so if you have these beliefs, how can you not bring them 100%? <br>  <br>  I'm an atheist, and would vote that way if I were in politics, but this is America and everyone's point of view matters. As much as fundies don't want atheists in politics, and vice versa, it doesn't matter because we need people to represent all of us in our legal system. In order to do that efficiently, if you are an elected official you must bring you belief system 100%. If you don't, then your not truly representing the people that supported you based on those beliefs.|`|3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	Well?  Everyone is different, so this would be personal between the believer & Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Jesus puts some in politics and some He takes out of politics.<br>  <br>  Myself? I like to trust God first, irregardless of politics. But I do make a stand for life. I also believe life starts at conception. That a person has started to form. And I do believe we should stick with the original definition of 'Marriage' to help strengthen family life.<br>  <br>  To change the definition of words that have been used historically in historical documents, laws, biblical or legal instances; This change would be unconstitutional.|`|Sn0CViR7aa	Obviously, politics plays 0% in our relationship with God.  God does not run the government, nor do we have to win votes to enter his kingdom.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, our relationship with God requires us to involve ourselves with politics.  As Jesus prayed, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."  God expects us to work for freedom and justice, his principles for the government of people made in his image.<br>  <br>  A good example is abortion. Could we possibly imagine that God doesn't care if prenatal babies are put to death for the convenience of their parents or as a profit-earning business?  If God doesn't care about the prenatal babies known and loved fully by him while yet in their mothers' wombs (see Psalm 139), then his prophets would not have railed against child sacrifice under the hideous alternative religions in Judea.<br>  <br>  I would estimate that 10% of our efforts in loving God would involve action to restore freedom and justice using just political means.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	I'm going to pick C.I'm not sure any of those fit what I want to say.We must take a solid stand on several issues if we are going to be claiiming Christianity.But, it need not distract from our walk w/ God,family,etc either.|`|45azZvL9aa	I think Christianity should be 100% in our lives, including politics.<br>  <br>  But watch out, many politicians are not what you think they are....

Quite simply, Idris and Jesus are present in the heavens with their earthly bodies, which have the subtlety of bodies from the World of Similitudes and the luminosity of star-like bodies. The Hadith the meaning of which is, “At the end of time, Jesus (Upon whom be peace) will come and will act in accordance with the Shari’a of Muhammed (PBUH),” indicates that at the end of time the religion of Christianity will be purified and divest itself of superstition in the face of the current of unbelief and atheism born of Naturalist philosophy, and will be transformed into Islam. At this point, just as the collective personality of Christianity will kill the fearsome collective personality of irreligion with the sword of heavenly Revelation, so too, representing the collective personality of Christianity, Jesus (Upon whom be peace) will kill the Dajjal, who represents the collective personality of irreligion, that is, he will kill atheistic thought.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2932&t=The+First+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2932&...</a><br>  <br>  The Third Kind: <br>  <br>  These are the irhasat including the wondrous events that occurred at the time of, and in conjunction with, Muhammad (ASW)'s birth. As for the other wonders that took place before the beginning of his prophethood, each of them is a miracle of his, and there are many incidents related to his birth. As examples, we will cite a few of those that became well-known and accepted by narration scholars, and are of verified authenticity. <br>  <br>  FIRST: On the night of the Prophet (ASW)'s birth, his mother and the mothers of Uthman b. As and of Abdurrahman b. al-Awf saw a magnificent light. All three of them said, "Such a light did we see during his birth that it illuminated the East and the West for us." <br>  <br>  SECOND: During that night many of the idols in the Ka'ba toppled over. <br>  <br>  THIRD: During the same night the palace of the famous Chosroes shook and cracked, and its fourteen pinnacles collapsed. <br>  <br>  FOURTH: On that night the sanctified lake of Sava sank into the soil. Again on that night, the fire that was worshiped by the Magians at Istakrabad and that had been kindled continuously for a thousand years without ever being extinguished, went out. These four incidents were all signs that the being who had just come into the world would abolish fire-worship, demolish the palace of the Persian royalty, and prohibit sanctification of things that Allah does not allow to be sanctified. <br>  <br>  FIFTH:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2950&t=The+Nineteenth+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2950&...</a>|`|QsbB6vkoaa	jesus death was more of a miracle than his birth, nowhere in the bible does it say that we must celebrate his birth, but it does mention that we must celebrate hi death.<br>  so although his birth was in fact a miracle, we should honor his death instead.|`|g8EViy1Raa	If Jesus existed it's a miracle anyone believed Mary was a virgin.|`|A9oWuOFBaa	No, because it never happened.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	Jesus is nothing more than a character in a fairy tale.
koynaDYbaa	Firstly, because of terrorism and a lot of the terrible things that have happened in the world, which are labeled as Muslim acts.. Most people have a mostly negative view on Islam.<br>  <br>  I don't think a lot of people search or try to find out about the religion and base their opinions on the bad things "so-called muslims" have done.<br>  Terrorism is totally against the Islamic faith and a lot of people do not realize it.<br>  <br>  I also think that by the media (etc) labeling terrorism today, and horrible CULTURAL acts (e.g.women's rights etc..), as Islamic.. it portrays this negative view even more.<br>  Personally, as a Muslim, I don't believe a terrorist, wife beater, etc.. is a Muslim. No matter how much they swear on Allah (God's) name. <br>  <br>  The same way as if a person claiming to be Christian was to commit such crimes, nobody would consider them Christian.<br>  <br>  I've also noticed that the Media do not label murderers, rapers, kidnappers, arsonists, for example, by using their faith bases.<br>  But when it comes to "Islamic" news its quick to pick up on the fact they are Muslim (or not, as I and millions of Muslims will agree).<br>  <br>  As a society, we should all go out and learn about different cultures, religions and practices. And also ignore the stereotypes.. Travel, read, talk !!<br>  Hope it helps !<br>  =D<br>  <br>  <br>  THE COMMENT BY Paperback Supports Geert Wilders -- IS MY POINT EXACTLY. =]|`|8I9uduIiaa	Why? Because a large number of those people are, right now, plotting terrorist atrocities and other forms of 'jihad'. Across Europe, Muslims are campaigning to get Sharia Law introduced. Only this week a  Norwegian politician publicly stated that 'fighting Islam is as important as fighting the Nazis was'.<br>  <br>  In the UK, in the past six weeks, two people have been banned from public meetings PURELY because they had the sheer guts to state that the cause of Islamic terrorism is ISLAM. I refer, of course to Geert Wilders and also author Douglas Murray, who was 'disinvited' from the LSE because Muslims students threatened to 'riot'.<br>  <br>  Islam is a political system. Don't fall into the trap of assuming it's similar to Judaism and Christianity.  It is *not*. Do yourself a favour - read the Quran. It's all there in black and white - the hatred for non Muslims or 'infidels'.<br>  <br>  Oh, and you might want to look at the 'rights' women have under Sharia Law. Or rather, the rights we DON'T have...<br>  <br>  I recommend: <a href="http://www.thereligionofpeace.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thereligionofpeace.com</a>|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	Why not?|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Because... welll....

The only difference is that unicorns, leprechauns, and pixies are supposedly "good guys" while demons are not. However, if you're talking about vampires I totally believe in them though I'm not sure if it's because I've been reading so many vampire books and am obsessed with Twilight, or if I truly do believe in them. But, as Edward Cullen say, "As technology advances, decrease in vampire belief lessens, which is good for us so the Volturi don't come and get us for exposure." But don't worry vampires are good guys! <br>  P.S. Do not believe the "sighting" they found of a unicorn in Antartica, some people figured out that  it is fake!

Later this angel became known as Satan the Devil. (Revelation 12:9) During the 16 centuries after he deceived Eve, Satan succeeded in turning away from God nearly all humans except a few faithful ones, such as Abel, Enoch, and Noah.—Hebrews 11:4, 5,?7.<br>  8 In Noah’s day, other angels rebelled against Jehovah. They left their place in God’s heavenly family, came down to the earth, and took on fleshly bodies. Why? We read at Genesis 6:2: “The sons of the true God began to notice the daughters of men, that they were good-looking; and they went taking wives for themselves, namely, all whom they chose.” But Jehovah God did not allow the actions of these angels and the resulting corruption of mankind to go on. He brought upon the earth a global flood that swept away all wicked humans and preserved only his faithful servants. (Genesis 7:17,?23) Thus, the rebellious angels, or demons, were forced to abandon their fleshly bodies and return to heaven as spirit creatures. They put themselves on the side of the Devil, who became “the ruler of the demons.”—Matthew 9:34.<br>  9 When the disobedient angels returned to heaven, they were treated as outcasts, like their ruler, Satan. (2?Peter 2:4) Although they are now unable to take on human bodies, they still exercise a very bad influence over humans. In fact, with the help of these demons, Satan “is misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Revelation 12:9; 1?John 5:19) How? Mainly, the demons use methods designed to mislead people. (2?Corinthians 2:11) Let us consider some of these methods.<br>  HOW DEMONS MISLEAD<br>  10 To mislead people, the demons use spiritism. The practice of spiritism is involvement with the demons, both in a direct way and through a human medium. The Bible condemns spiritism and warns us to keep free from everything connected with it. (Galatians 5:19-21) Spiritism does for the demons what bait does for fishermen. A fisherman uses a variety of baits to catch various kinds of fish. Similarly, wicked spirits use different forms of spiritism to bring all sorts of people under their influence.<br>  11 One type of bait used by the demons is divination. What is divination? It is an attempt to find out about the future or about something unknown. Some forms of divination are astrology, the use of tarot cards, crystal gazing, palmistry, and the search for mysterious omens, or signs, in dreams. Although many people think that practicing divination is harmless, the Bible shows that fortune-tellers and wicked spirits work together. For instance, Acts 16:16-18 mentions “a demon of divination” that enabled a girl to practice “the art of prediction.” But she lost this ability when the demon was cast out of her.<br>  12 Another way that the demons mislead people is by encouraging them to inquire of the dead. People grieving over the death of a loved one are often deceived by wrong ideas about those who have died. A spirit medium may give special information or may speak in a voice that seems to be that of a dead person. As a result, many people become convinced that the dead are really alive and that contacting them will help the living to endure their grief. But any such “comfort” is really false as well as dangerous. Why? Because the demons can imitate the voice of a dead person and give a spirit medium information about the one who died. (1?Samuel 28:3-19) Moreover, as we learned in Chapter?6, the dead have ceased to exist. (Psalm 115:17) So “anyone who inquires of the dead” has been misled by wicked spirits and is acting contrary to the will of God. (Deuteronomy 18:10,?11; Isaiah 8:19) Therefore, be careful to reject this dangerous bait used by the demons.<br>  13 Wicked spirits not only mislead people but also frighten them. Today, Satan and his demons know that they have only “a short period of time” left before they are put out of action, and they are now more vicious than ever. (Revelation 12:12,?17)|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Demons can be anything. I sometimes find that people are the root of all evil.

God also created time, and existed "before" time(although technically there was no "before" before time, you get my meaning), so once again God does not need a creator.<br>  <br>  Actually, when you say "God is infinite" that's right, though "God is eternal" would probably hit the mark a bit better.|`|AA11521494	Still doesn't work.  Quantum physics does.  Things just popping into existence out of nowhere are possible - very rare, but it only had to happen once to create the universe.|`|AA11008046	Terrible!|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	god's not an effect, god's not a creation. god is the cause, the creator. sorry if that blows your mind.
Lpc2aAzRaa	ignore the previous answers...<br>  <br>  <br>  it says, daughter of my uncle (as in cousin, to be specific, hes addressing the daughter of his father's brother) thank you for the add. (like she added him on face book or something) then he says, hope we become friends. bye.<br>  <br>  thats exaclty what it says.<br>  <br>  and the last thing it says,<br>  <br>  its an arabic expression,. ill try to break it down to u lol, it basically says, come every day, what it ACTUALLY means is...merly a sarcastic gesture, just a friendly joke. (not flirtatious at all)...hard to explain.<br>  <br>  <br>  also...the poem...<br>  Title: My love and the moon... i need to go out, therefore, didnt transalte the poem... i cld if u like... tc <br>  :-)<br>  <br>  have a good day.|`|ugCaMO3saa	Thanks very girl Uncle Ali added that the friends of God, ie Anasir<br>  <br>  im not sure if that right or not

K24JFTOcaa	fear = respect<br>  <br>  i respect God and who He is, i am not afraid of Him|`|FBrwlhPtaa	Christian is correct. Fear for Christians is reverence to the Lord. Fear for the unbelievers IS to be taken as fear. God has wrath!<br>  <br>  John 3:36<br>  Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him."|`|yN3fWUCuaa	You've got to read more than a word or two.<br>  <br>  As someone already said, 'fear' means respect for who He is.<br>  <br>  I do not fear Him in the hiding-in-the-bushes sense at all.    I am absolutely convinced that He loves me.   A quick read of Romans 8 sets * that * straight.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	That is right we are to fear God.|`|cd2etz5Raa	There's a difference in fear that is rationally related to Christianity, and the fear God is referring to.<br>  <br>  When you see a police officer and he orders you to do something, why do you do it? You respect that police officer but it's a fearful kind of respect, so you obey his orders, though not always.<br>  <br>  It's the same with God. We don't fear Him like we would an F5 tornado or something. It's a fearful respect / respectful fear.|`|4crqyM2laa	Who are we to question God?  Do you fear a snake that is in your sleeping bag?  So sleeping in a sleeping bag that has a snake in it, is fear based correct?  I think if you have the chance, you will fall before God on your stromach in fear because of his power and might, and then you will feel the love and compassiion of his Grace when he takes you into Heaven to sit at his right hand.  He died for your sins so you would be able to experience the fear and then the love of something that has no reason to accept you other than His love for you.  There is no possibility of Human understanding of this concept, so quit trying to explain it.  Just live or die with it.|`|Y5pi0E1naa	English is such an archaic language, nothing compared to the Greek language the New Testament was written in.  Because English is so dummied down, you have to take some liberties of translation.  the closest translation of  the use of 'fear' would fall between 'reverence' and 'respect'  So yeah, Christianity is based out of Reverence and Respect.|`|qJdWKcSQaa	'fear' has a different shade of meaning in the bible (you know this - please don't play dumb and troll around).<br>  <br>  And anyway, the bible was not originally written in english, so maybe there was something lost in translation . . .|`|150ffcb711824f9fc3252407402a28adaa	I call myself a Christian - no, better make it - I am a Christian, but I don't fear God, nor pray, nor ask anything from God. And yet, I believe - because I choose to. My God is a God of love, not of fear.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	Fear = reverence or awe<br>  <br>  Words do have different meanings, you know.  <br>  <br>  How can you NOT know that?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You have no citation, I do. Shame on you.<br>  <br>  1 John 4:18<br>  18There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Perhaps this verse will help you understand what is meant by fearing God.<br>  <br>   Proverbs 8:13<br>  "The fear of the LORD is to hate evil..."
itroxygvaa	Muslims do believe in what was sent down upon Jesus peace be upon him. BTW, there isn't any verse in the Gospel today where Jesus says "I'm God" or "Worship me". Muslims believe the Old Testament is corrupted as well, God Almighty sent Jesus peace be upon him to Israel as a fullfiller and a giver of glad tidings to get the Jews back on their law.<br>  As for Moses peace be upon him, he was Jewish in race and Muslim in faith so were Ibraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Yacob and the 12 sons of Yacob. They all seeked the face of God Almighty and they submitted to Him with all obedience. They were upright in faith and Muslims.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Islam believes that the Jews twisted the recording of God's Word. <br>  <br>  Yet, they honor Moses, who is credited with writing the Pentatuch, the first five books of the Bible. Why would Moses corrupt his own writings?<br>  <br>  It's like they cut off their noses to spite their faces, or throw shoes at one of their Patriarchs!|`|rIvp1BToaa	islam claims  all the prophets  were muslim  including Jesus  but of course that is  proves  how they twisted the bibles truth.|`|68lLAQnKaa	Because alot of religions manipulate things to fit their religion... moses was not muslim...|`|mQsAUjHXaa	the word muslim translates into "submission" meaning submitting to the will of God<br>  that's why he was a Muslim. Hes a prophet of Islam, and a noble and beloved one at that.<br>  he came with the same message that all the prophets came with. <br>  There is no god worthy of worship except God (Allah)<br>  his book was the torah and the scriptures (10 commandments)<br>  its a revered book in Islam.<br>  the word jew/hebrew came many years later<br>  <br>  <br>  edit*** i like how all these ppl think they know about a religion of which they dont follow...hahah makes me laugh. Im muslim, i practice Islam, I would know about my religion...wow ruth aravah jpa haha|`|qJdWKcSQaa	Does islam actually say moses was a muslim (source please), or they just believe he was a prophet?<br>  <br>  Maybe you need to pay more attention to what you read and how you interpret things . . .|`|Nzw6sHKeaa	To answer your question you need to ask did Moses submit to God's Will? The answer is Yes, so that in Arabic is called Muslim.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: as you can see, they try to backtrack their religion by centuries to make it more legitimate.  I've seen some also claim Adam as a Muslim too.<br>  <br>  Naming your religion "Submission to G-d" doesn't make it ancient, despite wishful thinking.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	You have answered your own question.<br>  <br>  It's almost like asking:  Someone told me that Obama is the president but someone else told me he is married, so which is it, is he president or is he married?<br>  <br>  If you understand that Muslim is a word that simply means "one who submits to the will of God" then you have to understand that Muslims believe Moses submitted to the will of God.  No other "facts" about Moses matters.
I5pUxwPbaa	Muslims are not supposed to celebrate birthdays and our Prophet Muhammad told us to only celebrate Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha.<br>  <br>  unfortunately some muslims have innovated and strayed from the teachings and celebrate things that we are not supposed to . We celebrate our prophet on a daily basis by following his sunna so there is no need to celebrate the one day.<br>  <br>  :)|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	Pakistani Muslims organize milad functions where poems about the prophet are recited. There are usually several in this month, nothing particular on the day of..|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Some do and others do not<br>  in some countries it is not allowed<br>  in others it is not encouraged<br>  others allow it<br>  and some celebrate as an official holiday<br>  but most important all agree that celebration of any sort must not include any wrong or unlawful behaviors<br>  so spend it in remembering his actions and sayings and check what you are missing in your life you need to follow.

QZvvHp3iaa	Andi, she had her fun, she had her cake and ate it too. you enjoyed your time together, somewhere inside of you you knew it wasn't serious. She has a boyfriend, yes it was wrong for her to string you along, but you opened that door and allowed whatever happened happen. As for the two of you remaining friends, that's up to you. I would tell her that you had some serious feelings for her and that she hurt you and you need time to get over her. Maybe you guys will be friends again, maybe not. But you do need to let her go.|`|EEzfM9Ywaa	Just leave her alone, jeez.

5Qo6OWNzaa	A little off the subject, but it is very interesting when you line up all 4 gospels side by side and compare them.. You can see one author is very direct and to the point, the next, a little more imagination, yet still uses exact quotes in most places, and eventually you get to Mathew..gotta love Matthew. What an imagination. This author can't keep from adding, exaggerating, embellishing the original text until its almost laughable. I think when you compare them side by side, its clear some authors were just embellishing the oldest gospel, Mark|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Matthew and John were written by two of the original 12 Apostles, Mark and Luke were not. Makes for interesting criteria.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Well, as there are only 4 and you want to compare 2 but not a certain 2 it only leaves you the other 2 OR are you prepared to compare Matthew with Luke and John OR compare Mark with Luke or John?<br>  <br>  Actually I don't savvy. Why don't you read all 4 and make your own comparisons in accordance with what you want to know.|`|uOwgkwTLaa	compare in what way? You could compare Daniel and Revelations for similarity in Prophecy. You could compare John and Matthew for teachings of Jesus. Many others. Hope that helps. Thanks and have a great day!|`|e51d513ea5bf8209f78025130c42d6a8aa	well since you only have two left....Luke & John <br>  <br>  However, comparative studies in the gospels is best left to the first three.|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	So there are 4 gospels, you want to compare 2, but not Matthew and Mark.<br>  <br>  Is this a maths question?|`|i444oWjjaa	Huh?<br>  <br>  Are you asking which is "better", Luke or John?<br>  <br>  John is the most different, by far. The other three are known as the "Synoptic Gospels", because they can be read side by side with the same general narrative.
Yzcptoagaa	Find running water as quickly as possible.  You'll need it to get drinkable water, and you can follow it until it hits a river.  Rivers flow towards the sea and human settlements are most likely to be found near rivers and deltas.  Plus, if you follow the running water you won't get lost and walk in circles.<br>  <br>  You can try to use a stick to catch small fish in the stream, or pick bugs out of the water to eat.  You can also look for trees with milk bark, which is edible.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you're not a trained survivalist, you're in for a rough time.|`|L2fN1ZUVaa	I'd be scared Shitless..<br>  All the animals are coming out to get me XD|`|fmNEhf3Qaa	Look for familiar lookin juicy fruit growing on the trees.

You didn't have to do it but you did.|`|JMOLRKRraa	That's a good idea you have.<br>  Word like,<br>   Lord Jesus help me, to help my sponsor child in Africa, for as he / she is weak from circumstance and environment, and is falling and suffering from the cross of his/ her country birthright; strengthen and enable me, to help him/ her carry the cross of suffering, hunger,lack, poverty, and lighten the load, if for a while. As dearest Simon helped you carry your cross after your third fall.|`|Y5aZesjaaa	Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry the cross, inreturn something good happens to him, its just like sponsoring a child in afica.|`|xZet9Dunaa	Dear Jesus please help me carry my own cross in this world .

4Vswcoqeaa	Good analogy.  I think it's so the masses are distracted from the real problems.  If people knew how grave the situation really is, there'd be rioting, mass panic, etc.|`|150ffcb711824f9fc3252407402a28adaa	It's not just that - many more "problems" are as silly and stupid as that one - race, ethnicity, religion, etc... I think it is because it's much more easy to make a lot of noise about trivial matters and get away as nothing has happened, than to try to fix serious problems and maybe get hurt or compromised in the process. People often do that - when facing a catastrophe or a serious threat, they immediately decide that it is unstoppable and turn their anger and insecurity towards something 'easier to solve'...|`|jOPUBmlJaa	As a whole, it may be people who thinkthat they can live on this planet by not co-operating with others to strive for a greater world. If we could let go of our differences, love would be all that remained and then we could change the world for the better, for a common goal.|`|z2YcXSvZaa	i ask the same question. homosexuality has been around about just as long as heterosexuality. everybody is so afraid of it like it's new or something.|`|zi6Rhy2naa	Because of industrialization.

Yet every 10 questions on here seems to be about sexuality.<br>  <br>  What's worse is that instead of doing something about it, people are just pointing fingers at each other.  Apparently bashing religious people for their beliefs or bashing gays is more important than feeding your neighbor.<br>  <br>  Now excuse me as I grab food for the food pantry and clothes for the shelter.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	God is apparently bigger than everything.. and anything that is a disagreement with god is considered a BIG problem. It's simply the truth (reality in their minds).. If you have a lot of faith in god and something confronts him, you'll of course take action against it.<br>  <br>  Good analogy btw.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	It gets the religious nuts (I realize that's redundant) to the polls. That's the only reason it's even discussed in politics.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Indeed. Good analogy.|`|0YL8qVMsaa	Because it those people ever thought about the real issues facing us their heads would explode.

You are amazing!|`|FGfaO2Ecaa	your professor seems to really care about you. i guess it is okay to tell her if you're ready. it might help to open up to more people.|`|6mXvwy7Jaa	I don't think it is ever an especially good idea to go up to someone you kinda know and just tell them that you are gay. <br>  <br>  Same with someone telling coming up and saying they are catholic or an alcoholic or have a twin. Whenever that happens to me, I just think..."Okay...? And?" It's meaning might be obvious to you, but it isn't necessarily to others.<br>  <br>  If you must, it seems like it is better to express your emotional/social situation. Not that you should avoid the gay part but that "gay" is not an answer to her question.<br>  <br>  Say that you are having some identity/family/relationship/whatever issues. If she needs to know more than that, expand. But start with the basic emotional problem, not what the problem revolves around. <br>  <br>  I don't think she wants to personally fix it, I think she wants to know what it is so that she knows how to deal with it/if you are in danger/whether or not to send you to the school therapist.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Oh, and about opening up to others, it does help. But don't rush it. <br>  <br>  I know I was awkward about it for a while and if I had ignored my discomfort and told everyone I probably would have stressed out about what they were thinking. <br>  <br>  I am in a much more comfortable place now and really don't care if everyone in my family knows(that made me pretty nervous before). <br>  <br>  My point is, if telling someone feels right, go for it, if it doesn't, wait. If you work toward being open and comfortable(if that is what you want) then eventually you will get there. Rushing will just make the ride bumpier.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	This is tricky, you shouldn't feel obligated to tell her. My math professor was always trying to introduce me to female students....until one day I told her I was gay|`|i8cFHtUzaa	If you feel comfortable about it, then yes. But don't be like "well, the reason i'm acting weird is because I'm gay!"<br>  <br>  Just throw it out there casually, like it's natural- Because in reality, it IS natural.

Thanks.>><br>  <br>  If you've been away from the Church any length of time, you should probably receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation before receiving Communion again.<br>  When you do go up for Communion, the priest or Extra-Ordinary Minister will say, "(This is) The Body/Blood oif Christ", to which you reply, "Amen."<br>  It's customary to show some act of reverence to the Eucharist by making a small bow of the head when you approach to receive. And/or the Sign of the Cross after you've received.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about feeling out of place. The rest of the Congregation is focused on the Mass. They won't notice whether or not you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  If you would like to relearn the beliefs and practices of the Church, I highly recommend you get a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	ahh guilty?

It is time to cultivate a new group of friends.|`|dcovK6oqaa	Because they have nothing better to do. I asked myself the same question. people can't accept imperfection. They see some one who is blind or deaf or just have a learning disability. They make fun of you and treat you like crap.  But you know I believe what comes around goes around. Those people who are cruel and make fun of people who have a dissability. One day they will suffer the same disability. So they should see how it feels. I do believe in karma. they say that in this life you make fun of some one with a disability problem.  than in the next life you will suffer one.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	It could be that it is not easy to deal with someone who cannot do what you can.  I had trouble with walking for some time and this resulted in the loss of some friends as I was not able to move around easily.

Real friends support you. This friend sounds like someone who expects you to be there for them, when they need you.

Unless this rotation was slower or faster then (it wasn't) then a day is still equal to the same time period.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	I believe they were literally days, if you were to read the Bible, you would notice it clearly says morning and evening. Additionally, no where else in the Bible is a day, 1,000 or more years.|`|AA11849917	In the first chapter of Genesis, a day ("Yom" in Hebrew) is described as "an evening and a morning" - a period of darkness (night) followed by a period of daylight.  When Moses wrote this (by revelation from God, since he wasn't there), he went out of his way to define what is meant by "day" ("yom").  And unless specifically defined differently, this is ALWAYS the definition of a day.<br>  <br>  If each rotation of the earth around its axis lasted a billion years (6 billion years for evolution to occur), then what could possibly speed the earth up to the point in which it revolves around its axis in a 24-hour period?  The earth would blow itself apart if it sped up that much.  Actually, the earth couldn't go that slow.  Friction would stop it completely!<br>  <br>  Furthermore, to those who DO actually believe that a "day" represented an "epoch", then just think - a few thousand years of darkness followed by a few thousand years of daylight ("evening and morning") is absolutely NOT conducive to life, evolved or otherwise!<br>  <br>  No, each day in Genesis represented a literal 24-hour period of time for the earth to rotate once around its axis, just as the Bible says ("an evening and a morning.")<br>  <br>  Good question.

Eve thought the birth of her son was the answer to the prophecy of a future seed in the bible.  Yet Jesus was born some 4000 years later.<br>  <br>  I do believe that God made animals with the ability to adapt to their surroundings which does not mean evolution but variations of the creation.  We came from the same two people yet we have humans of different shapes, sizes, colors and personalities.  <br>  One of the reasons persons do not believe the bible I think has to do with a lot of Christians who insist on putting it into their terms and time limits.  I think the animals were on the earth for billions of years before mankind.  I cannot even imagine the time it took to create all the animal kinds.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Maybe that's because the creation story is a collection of much older works, some as far back as the Epic of Gilgamesh, edited into what you see today.

There simply isn't space here to post all the pertinent scriptures, demonstrating the consistency of the use of wording in the language.<br>  <br>  It is a true statement that "yome" can mean a day, a season, or an indeterminate period of time...but it is ALSO true that throughout the OT, whenever "yome" is used WITH either morning OR evening in the same sentence, it is obvious from the context that it is referring to a period of 24 hours; here are a few examples OUTSIDE of Genesis, yet within the Torah (The Torah is simply The Law, or the First 5 books of the Old Testament):<br>  <br>  Exo 10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. <br>  <br>  Exo 16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. <br>  <br>  Exo 19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. <br>  <br>  Lev 6:20 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night. <br>  <br>  Each of these verses, written in the SAME language, using the very SAME HEBREW WORDS AS USED IN GENESIS, by the SAME author, in the SAME part of the Bible as Genesis, leave NO DOUBT as to a 24 hour day...There are far too many more examples to post; Why would the creation week be the ONLY place that these words represent something DIFFERENT?<br>  <br>  To interpret differently is to use linguistic gymastics, ignore the rest of the text, and quite preposterous. Why would we pick a few sentences to make exception to common sense?<br>  <br>  It is very unfortunate in 2009, there are people and entire websites built around attempts to destroy the credibility of the Bible...Most of them attempt it without the slightest idea of what they are really talking about.<br>  <br>  Now, let's keep talking about this Hebrew language of the OT; there is NO PUNCTUATION in Ancient Hebrew!!??&$#@%* Whenever the writer wished to EMPHASIZE something, using ALL CAPS wasn't an option, neither was underlining or exclamation points....How was it done??<br>  <br>  Repetition, repetition, repetition...And 3 times repetition is maximum. This is probably why the Bible says God is Holy, Holy, Holy (Isaiah 6:3). It states in Genesis:<br>  <br>  Gen 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. <br>  Gen 1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. <br>  Gen 1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. <br>  Gen 1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. <br>  Gen 1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. <br>  Gen 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. <br>  <br>  Remember, 3 times repetition is maximum in Hebrew, yet in Genesis, "yome" is used with morning AND evening, for ALL 6 days...This is DOUBLE emphasis to the max by using both morning and evening, and repetition SIX TIMES. Such emphasis, clarity, and repetition is used nowhere else in the Old Testament, I'd say God REALLY wants us to get this.<br>  <br>  There is also sound science to confirm this:  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5725394906886443944" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a> This video is about 29 minutes long and presents scientific peer reviewed, court unrefuted evidence of the age of the earth. Of course, this is very inconvenient to atheists/evolutionists.<br>  <br>  Once we have established creation week as a week in the sense we know of, Sunday thru Saturday, it is simply a matter of math to do the geneaolgies in Genesis 5, 11, and Matthew 1 to realize just how close Bishop Ussher is/was. The begats do NOT have gaps; they're just not all listed in the same chapter.<br>  <br>  I know there is disagreement among mature Christians regarding this; and I gladly concede it is NOT necessary for salvation to agree upon the age of the earth....But it is exciting to me as a Christian to see the Truth of God's Word revealed; and I think it helps us mature as Christians to realize the Bible STARTS OUT with hermeneutic truth. <br>  <br>  Hermeneutical's first definition is PLAIN or LITERAL, and Genesis' truth is very simple and plain... I would remind skeptic Christians that the word "parable" is used consistently PRIOR TO a parable in the New Testament; and Genesis as a book is NOT classified by scholars as Poetry, it is part of the Torah, or Law. <br>  <br>  Therefore the poetic use of language such as metaphor, hyperbole, allegory and simile are not used and DO NOT APPLY.

You only have to take a look around you, or turn on the news to find examples of this. <br>  <br>  I think a large problem lies in the fact that books such as the bible, torah Qu'ran and so forth are in many places not clear on their meaning. Look at the world today and look at the contrasting views held by, for example, just Christians. You have the world hating, gay-bashing extremists like Westboro Baptist church, or right-wing American Christians claiming that the only truth is the truth that lies in the original King James version of the bible (one which is well known to be flawed in it's translation with many words being mistranslated). in one corner, then the more liberal (and equally as controversial), such as Revolution Churches tattooed Pastor Jay Bakker, a man who has caused much controversy by embracing ideas such as homosexuality and opening his heart towards these sorts of people. Jay claims that our views towards homosexuals are flawed through years of misinterpreting what the bible actually means and also that God personally told him to accept these people into his congregation and allow them to continue as they are.<br>  <br>  How can one man say this, yet another the opposite? Perhaps if these differing handbooks and accounts from 'God' (or whichever name this character goes by in each respective book) were more clear things would be simpler. <br>  <br>  Now seriously, how can millions of people claim to believe in the same thing when they are all pulling in different directions? It's all good and well and people will defend themselves to the heavens (pun intended) by saying their interpretation is right. They may claim others are devils (nice cop-out if you're losing a debate), they may simply say out of arrogance that they are right and are one of the chosen. However, how can any of us know this? God spoke to you did he? Well he also spoke to thousands of other people in other countries and guess what, his name wasn't God there. It was Allah or Zeus or Baal or Ganesha. How do we explain that? Demons again? Are they tempting people away from the one truth? Doubtful. Look at how many people live good, honest lives but believe things entirely different from each other.<br>  <br>  Certainly, religion can bring comfort to people and I do not doubt that people have 'spiritual connections' of some sort with something, but by going out and preaching, kicking, screaming, shouting, gunning down and maiming other people in the name of your God you're not really doing very much to open peoples eyes to the goodness of your chosen 'truth'. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, despite differing interpretations some good can be pulled from religious texts which cannot be doubted or misread. The 10 commandments, for example, offer what I'd consider a simple, agreeable approach to morality. Regardless of who you are and where you live, the vast majority of people would agree; it's just common sense. However, as I've mentioned it's these differing interpretations of the bible and other texts that cause the problems. <br>  <br>  The character of Jesus (and many of the other biblical figures) offer examples of what could be considered sensible and inspirational living. Despite being depicted as (usually white for one) having perfect, glowing hair, a beard and beautiful robes, the fact is that if Jesus was real he wouldn't have been some glowing figure, he would've been smelly. He was effectively a hobo, wandering from place to place sleeping where he could. He was also friends with the outcasts. Men who stank of fish, tax collectors, prostitutes... He showed levels of respect to women and children that were frowned upon due to the extreme patriarchal nature of the time. Whether a fictional character or not, we can all see the good in the Character of Jesus. Perhaps it shouldn't matter whether Jesus was real or not. Could that be missing the point? Perhaps the point is simply that as the 'perfect man' he lived a life (albeit fictional to some) that we ourselves should strive for.<br>  <br>  The search for an understanding of a higher being is a very valid and interesting one. Even by chosing not to believe in God and adhering to ideas of evolution, you're still putting your faith in 'something'. <br>  <br>  I conclude, therefore, that it is not the search for the divine that is the problem but people, books and history. Perhaps we should practice faith as individuals. Perhaps we should keep our faiths internalized. It is not a belief in something that is destructive, rather the construct of a religion and a rule book around it.|`|PkgBbVW0aa	Santa Claus or Christmas is based on old pagan religions way back before it was commercialised.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

iAXmdQOEaa	Sorry to say that we dont go to heaven. The bible makes it very clear on what happens to us when we die.   People take the verses out of context and think that they go somewhere else.  That is not true.  Is our reward in heaven when we die?  Certainly not.   Jesus makes it clear that our reward is with him when he comes back to earth. <br>  <br>  Why do people think their reward is in heaven?  Let's see what the bible tells us.   Did God tell anyone in the OT that when they would die they would go to heaven?  No....... <br>  <br>  How come God did not tell Adam that he had an immortal soul?<br>  <br>   When God told Abraham that his reward would be all of the land he could see from the North, South, East and West.   Did God tell him to look up?   No.........<br>  <br>  Abraham died not having his reward yet.  He is dead and buried.  God tells him that he will have his reward when Christ comes back.   Nothing on going to heaven.<br>  <br>  The bible does not tell us that we have an immortal soul.  The word "immortal soul" is not even in the bible,  but people still believe that we do. <br>  <br>  <br>  There is nothing anywhere in the Bible that makes a difference between a man and his body, or indicates that a man can exist apart from his body. We have seen that God made man (himself) of the dust of the ground, and then breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and "HE (the man) became a living soul" or creature. The dust-formed being itself became a living creature<br>  <br>  The true believer seeks for immortality, and will be rewarded for this by the gift of eternal life - something he does not naturally possess (Rom. 2:7; 6:23;<br>  Our mortal body "must put on immortality" at the return of Christ (1 Cor. 15:53); thus immortality is something promised, not now possessed (1 John 2:25).<br>  <br>  God alone has inherent immortality (1 Tim. 6:16).  That right there tells us that we DONT go to heaven.  We are not immortal like God!!!<br>  <br>  When animals die... do they go to heaven???   of course not,  never do man.<br>  <br>  "In death there is no remembrance of Thee: in the grave, who shall give Thee thanks?" (Psalm 6:5).<br>  "The grave cannot praise Thee; death cannot celebrate Thee; they that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth: the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day" (Isaiah 38:18-19).<br>  ECC.  9 V 5    For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten.<br>  6   Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share In anything done under the sun.<br>  10   Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going<br>  <br>  There is not a single promise of heaven at death in the whole Bible; not a single hint that man has an "immortal soul", or anything else that lives on after death. The basic truth emphasized over and over is:<br>  "THE DEAD KNOW NOT ANYTHING."|`|KgCUpE5naa	Yes, we do.<br>  The "dead know nothing and don't remember" comes from the time before judgement day, while we rest in the earth, we shall "remember nothing."<br>  <br>  On judgement day, our souls will ascend to heaven, where we will be judged before God.<br>  <br>  Those who are not written in the Book of Life will go to, well, basically nothingness. The "Lake of Fire" is a metaphor basically for an afterlife devoid of God. I don't think people will literally burn in physical torment forever.|`|RZetcwalaa	Its a nice thought eternal life, people like nice thoughts eg. tooth fairy, easter bunny, santa, but sadly it doesn't make them true,  you wont survive your own death, im sorry to be the one who tells you but the chances of you somehow transcending your physical body are at best nothing.|`|NAfvweMwaa	If you believe God is your savior and you accept him into your life to help you and guide you through life, then yes, YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN AND WALK ON THE STREETS OF GOLD. <br>  <br>  But, if you deny him and shut him out of your life, then no...you'll burn in the lake of fire..every day for the rest of your life.|`|oGbHyZR8aa	We could all give you our own opinions, but that's for you to decide.<br>  <br>  You believe what you want to believe.<br>  Even if you don't want to be religious, but choose to believe in heaven for comfort, that's up to you.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believe in Jesus alone for salvation or not. <br>  <br>  So to be in heaven and not hell, believe in Jesus alone for salvation now! :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|mmks8Dyuaa	can't really say much but to believe in what you believe<br>  i don't really see god in my life and i think that when we die<br>  its just over. blank. black. i don't think when someone says or has their limbs ripped off, they become a ghost in the sky or underground.<br>  doesn't sound believable|`|lzp70MlZaa	yes we do go to heaven. on the day that we get raptured up to heaven so do the dead to, we get new glorified bodies.

Notice Jesus' own warning words:<br>  <br>  “Many will say to me: ‘Lord, did we not prophesy, expel demons, & perform many powerful works in your name?’  Yet I will confess to them: I *never* knew you! *Get away from me*, you workers of lawlessness. --Matthew 7:21-23  <br>  <br>  "You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied...<br>  ‘This people honors me with their lips, <br>  yet *their heart is far removed* from me. <br>   It is in vain that they keep worshiping... <br>  because *they teach commands of men as doctrines*.’”  --Matthew 15:7,8  <br>  <br>  One of those *false* teachings is that all those who die faithful go to heaven. But, Jesus was the very first one to be resurrected to heaven, so where would that leave the many faithful ones who died long before him..?

As nice as it sounds I am not even sure it exists.|`|utbfT0APaa	What's this we, kemosoby, if YOU are born again and accept Jesus as your savior then YOU will go to heaven. It's that simple.|`|4crqyM2laa	How do you know the dead don't remember, have you spoken with them?  If you have then you are dealing with the occult, which depends on Satan.  Satan is a liar, so you can't believe what He says and you must remember the Earth is his.  So, if you don't believe in Christ then there will be no Heaven for you.  I would suggest you take your search too scripture, because the only thing that is abosolute in this world is the very next second of your life.  After that it's too late. Non believers will tell you everything just ends, but what if they are wrong, who is the real loser?|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Probably not. It's really not very likely that there's another plane of existence with gold streets and winged beings flying around everywhere, where we exist in ephemeral form with our invisible daddy figure and everything is all swell, all the time. Just not very damn likely, and certainly not more likely than the thousands and thousands of other afterlife myths which have existed in human history.|`|1CS2KR7Taa	We try to escape to these images of Heaven, because we are unhappy with our lives here, or we are afraid of death.<br>  And religions are pushing these images (together with the images of Hell) because it fits into their "reward and punishment" system.<br>  But instead of running away from our reality we should try to build "Heaven" right here, right now, before we actually die.<br>  What is causing the feeling, that we actually live in "Hell" at present?<br>  It is our inherent selfish nature, where we only care about ourselves, we use the others for our own benefit. This behavior is the cause for all the troubles (like financial crisis, climate change, wars, terrorism, etc) we have in the world today. It is not our sin, we were born this way.<br>  We just need to recognize this situation, and need to want to change it.<br>  The way we can change it is to build new connections in between people, this time based on mutual caring, unconditional giving and love, always keeping the well being of the whole as the main priority.<br>  You can imagine, if we could build a human society based on such principles we would have "Heaven on Earth".<br>  Not to mention, that this would catapult us into a new type of existence where even the fear of death would be irrelevant, but let us not complicate things too much.<br>  So do we really go to Heaven? It is in our hands.<br>  All the best.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	Yes we go to Heaven if we believe that Jesus died for our sins.  True, people who are dead cant talk to us, they are either in Heaven or in Hell.  Christians believe we go to Heaven because a verse in the Bible says that no man cometh unto the Father but by Me (Jesus).  And the Bible declares that we will be damned for eternity if we do not believe in Him.  So that proves enough that people either go to Heaven or Hell.  Thats why Christians believe in going to Heaven and Hell.|`|zFhhgL0Oaa	dont listen to the angry atheists, everyone goes to heaven if they receive jesus as their savior,receive the body and blood of jesus, baptised, and confess their sins.... anyone else is by the mercy of jesus to decide whether they do or dont and no one else|`|fkqPs9QRaa	I'm not sure why people believe so, mabye a sense of security and comfort?

At that time there was no place built for the worship of Allah. Ibrahim wished there could be such a place where people would be in peace, and concentrate solely for the worship of Allah. His wish was answered when Allah ordered him to build the Sacred House, the Ka'bah. Ibrahim said to Ismail: "O Ismail, Allah has given me an order, will you help me execute it?" "Yes I will." Ismail said. "Allah has ordered me to build a house here." He said, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it. They went towards the place and started building the foundations of the Ka'bah Ismail brought the stones and Ibrahim built the walls, and when the walls became high, Ismail brought a large stone and put it in front of his father who stood over it and carried on building, while Ismail was handing him the stones. Both of them went on building and going around the Ka'bah, saying: "O our Lord accept this service from us." When they finished the building, Angel Jibreel descended from heaven and showed Ibrahim the rituals of Hajj. Then Ibrahim stepped on the stone and called on people: "O people obey your Lord." This large stone which Ibrahim stepped on is still there to this day near the Ka'bah. It is called Makam Ibrahim.<br>  Thus ends the story of Ibrahim, the father of the prophets. From him descended all the prophets who came later, including Muhammad, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam. Ibrahim devoted all his life calling others to the True religion: Islam. Alone he stood against his people, his father, and even the mighty king of Babylon, and never flinched. Yet his method was always to gradually persuade them by bringing irrefutable proofs, that most often embarrassed those who refused to accept the Truth, but as Allah said: "Any whom Allah leaves to stray, there is none to guide !" <br>  <br>  IslamiCity|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	[Quran 2:124] And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled: He said: "I will make thee an Imam to the Nations."

He answered: "But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers."|`|zHNPTV67aa	its a very long story but its one of the best i like talking about do u have that book stories of the prophets its all in there and read surah 2 and 3 talks alot bout ibrihim as|`|tfkpNh89aa	""What should I say to make it easy for a non Muslim to understand? ""<br>  <br>  Well you can start by saying that Ibrahim of the koran is NOT the Abraham of Hebrew Bible  and the Old Testament and that they are two different people.<br>  <br>  Because if you are talking to a Jew and or a Christian about Ibrahim as he is written in the koran, you are doomed... that is if your "subjects" have any brains. <br>  <br>  Abraham was never near the kaba, didn't built it, didn't do anything with it.  <br>  <br>  If you want to discuss your Ibrahim from the koran verses Abraham from the Torah and Old Testament, well then, you need to do some homework.

Non-mahram men are men such as brothers-in-law, cousins, and any man to whom she is not related.  Wearing perfume is a way of attracting a man, which is not appropriate for women, who should be modest in dress and manner when they go out.  They can wear perfume at home around their husbands and near relatives, or to gatherings where there will be only women.  This does not mean a Muslim woman shouldn't be clean, because cleanliness is very important in Islam, but she should use soaps that do not have a heavy fragrance.<br>  <br>  Men are actuall encouraged to wear nice-smelling colognes, but also they should be clean first and not using them to cover up a lack of personal hygiene.

The Prophet (SAW) said:<br>  "Any woman who wears perfume then goes out to the mosque so that the fragrance can be discerned, her prayers will not be accepted until she perfoms ghusl like the ghusl performed when in a state of janabah."[Imam Ahamd, 2/444; see also Saheeh al-Jami', hadith no. 2703]|`|3Ur0zrlLaa	if you go to arabic countries you will see loads of perfume shops the same all brands & they have their own oil based fragrances its true that they  should not wear perfume or put make up but few people are doing that they spend alot  of money  just for  make up & perfumes|`|YUq2kwxJaa	As long as no man other than your husband smells it..

A democratic society can and should use some of its resources to help poor and disadvantaged people to to overcome poverty and disability.

If this happens to be an oligarchy based on evidence and reason, things are fine. What we generally get is one based on wealth and/or religion, which is not good at all.<br>  <br>  Socialism, on the other hand, makes the mistake of assuming that the basic worker is intellectually suited to controlling the means of production. This is nonsense. <br>  <br>  I believe in a pseudo-free market economy based on requirements of transparency and full disclosure. This is also my standard for democracy. In the US (where I live) excuses about "national security" and the rampant legislation of more laws than one person could ever read make democracy - and capitalism - little more than  a smoke screen for special interests.|`|AA11058044	I'm so far left that there's no Canadian political party that's liberal enough for me.<br>  <br>  By American standards, that probably puts me left of Hugo Chavez and Karl Marx.<br>  <br>  However, I've never seen a socialist doctrine or political system that would work in the real world.<br>  <br>  I think that what we need is a capitalist system, but we need to change the idea of what "profit" is.<br>  <br>  If a company, corporation or institution is run not for the greatest monetary profit of its shareholders, but rather for the highest standard of living for its shareholders, the whole system changes.  Rather than playing the game just to gather the most "points" in some meaningless race to have the biggest number, it becomes about having the strongest team.<br>  <br>  I think that's the direction we should be heading.  I've never seen any system that tries to achieve this.

2e6d0bf8ecab06aa35b4c1cb6fa300d5aa	Many believe the Nephilim are demigods, the unnatural offspring of mortal women in cohabitation with “the sons of god.”<br>  <br>  If you research Greek mythology you will find that Zeus had an appetite for human woman. Hercules was supposed to be the son of a mortal woman and Zeus.  Alexander the Great was said to be the son of Zeus, when Zeus transposed himself into a snake and lay with his human mother Olympia.  Argos, the first King and Eponym of Argos (in Southern Greece). He was a son of Zeus and Niobe, a human. The list goes on…<br>  <br>  When the Greek Septuagint was composed, "Nephilim" was translated as "Gegenes" and in some copies it was translated as “Gigantes." “Gigantes" or "Gegenes" does not translate to “giants”; rather it means "Born of the Earth" or "Born of Gaia.” In the Greek myth, the Gigantes made war on the gods, but were destroyed in the ensuing battle.<br>  <br>  The Nephilim were a race of man of extraordinary physical stature and strength compared to the smaller Hebrews. As in the same comparisons of the story of David and Goliath, Goliath was referred to as a “Giant,” though not necessarily a giant, but one whose overgrown portions dwarfed the appearance of the smaller race of David’s people.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Fallen angels (devils) united with human women, creating very abnormal and evil giants.|`|Ek0eDO00aa	...and also a goth band from the 80s.

m3YC7Jcyaa	This sermon was delivered on the Ninth Day of Dhul Hijjah 10 A.H. in the 'Uranah valley of Mount Arafat' (in Mecca). <br>  After praising, and thanking Allah he said:<br>  "O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether after this year, I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and TAKE THESE WORDS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE PRESENT HERE TODAY.<br>  O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...<br>  Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.<br>  O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.<br>  O People, listen to me in earnest, worship ALLAH, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.<br>  All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.<br>  Remember, one day you will appear before ALLAH and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.<br>  O People, NO PROPHET OR APOSTLE WILL COME AFTER ME AND NO NEW FAITH WILL BE BORN. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the QURAN and my example, the SUNNAH and if you follow these you will never go astray.<br>  All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. Be my witness, O ALLAH, that I have conveyed your message to your people".|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	Inshallah I am going to Iran soon too.

They are some of the best cooks and cheesemakers in the world. If you could obtain a shoe-fly pie, it would go a long way to make the thing memorable.<br>  <br>  Since the Old Order Mennonites (and Amish) shun modern conveniences, they don't have/use refrigerators. The name, shoe-fly pie came from the practice of placing a pie (usually made with molasses) on an open window sill to cool. Naturally, the molasses attracted flies (common in communities with a lot of animals, like horses to pull their buggies). Those responsible for the pie would constantly be "shooing" flies away from the pie.<br>  <br>  You could also obtain cheese (it would be best if you could actually obtain some from a place that sold Mennonite or Amish Cheese) and share it with the class. I suspect you don't have much time to order anything from a store that sells and ships, so I won't bother giving out that information, but maybe substituting a good Cheddar, Swiss, or Colby cheese would suffice.

Do not be surprised, my brothers, of the world hates you. We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death. Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him."<br>   1 John 3: 11-15<br>  <br>  "Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.

There is only one religious group that does this worldwide, on a consistent basis - Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  This is their trademark. The many comments on here about JW's attest to that. Why do they keep coming back to my door? What do you do when a JW knocks on your door? I wish they stop knocking at my door? Why do they keep coming to my house over and over again? These questions are commonplace. But what these questions also show is consistency with our work. This is what we are commanded by Jesus Christ to do. "Go therefore..." We must not sit and do nothing. The apostle Paul preached from house to house as written above in Acts 20:20. He bore thorough witness.<br>  <br>  These scriptures are also applicable to us today. Many people say "we do not know when the end of the world is coming." That is the problem. People do not read the Bible. They disregard it.

They should be first class relics (bone fragments or part of the saint's body)<br>  <br>  In the Book of Revelations, when St. John talks about the Saints Dressed in White below the Alter, he is meaning the bones of the saints below the altar where Mass is said. Usually the relics in the altar stone are of the Saint that the Church was named after. The placing of the relics is part of the consecration of the Church<br>  Relics do not save people, and the Catholic Church does not teach that they do. Jesus saves people.<br>  <br>  Relics can, however, remind us of flesh-and-blood people who generously cooperated with God's grace. Those Saints, in turn, can encourage us to cooperate just as generously with God's grace.<br>  <br>  I suspect that you and I agree that Jesus Christ has saved us through his passion, death and resurrection. I further suspect that we agree that a person could choose not to accept salvation. How? By that person's choices.<br>  <br>  Saints remind us to make good and generous choices. Relics can remind us of Saints (including Mary). All walked this earth and eventually gave God an accounting for their stewardship of resources, time and talent.<br>  <br>  The Son of God became a human being, in the person of Jesus Christ, within a specific time and in a designated place. In a sense, relics remind us of Jesus' Incarnation and of our need—right here, right now—to make choices which reflect and reinforce our identity as followers of Jesus.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Catholics do that.They used to sell 'indulgences' to those who wished to view the relics.I think indulgences got you out of purgatory faster.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	<a href="http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/relics_place.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/reli...</a>|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	The use of relics has some, although limited, basis in sacred Scripture. In 2 Kings 2:9-14, the prophet Elisha picked up the mantle of Elijah after Elijah had been taken up to heaven in a whirlwind. With it, Elisha struck the water of the Jordan, which then parted so that he could cross. In another passage (13:20-21), some people hurriedly bury a dead man in the grave of Elisha, "but when the man came in contact with the bones of Elisha, he came back to life and rose to his feet." In the Acts of the Apostles we read, "Meanwhile, God worked extraordinary miracles at the hands of Paul. When handkerchiefs or cloths which had touched his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases were cured and evil spirits departed from them" (19:11-12). In these three passages, a reverence was given to the actual body or clothing of these very holy people who were indeed God's chosen instruments—Elijah, Elisha and St. Paul. Indeed, miracles were connected with these "relics"—not that some magical power existed in them, but just as God's work was done through the lives of these holy men, so did His work continue after their deaths.<br>  <br>  The veneration of relics of the saints is found in the early history of the Church. A letter written by the faithful of the Church in Smyrna in the year 156 provides an account of the death of St. Polycarp, their bishop, who was burned at the stake. The letter reads, "We took up the bones, which are more valuable than precious stones and finer than refined gold, and laid them in a suitable place, where the Lord will permit us to gather ourselves together as we are able, in gladness and joy, and celebrate the birthday of his martyrdom." Essentially, the relics—the bones and other remains of St. Polycarp—were buried and the tomb itself was the "reliquary." Other accounts attest that the faithful visited the burial places of the saints and miracles occurred. Moreover, at this time we see the development of "feast days" marking the death of the saint, the celebration of Mass at the burial place and a veneration of the remains.<br>  <br>  After the legalization of the Church in 312, the tombs of saints were opened and the actual relics were venerated by the faithful. A bone or other bodily part was placed in a reliquary—a box, locket and later a glass case—for veneration. This practice especially grew in the Eastern Church, while the practice of touching cloth to the remains of the saint was more common in the west. By the time of the Merovingian and Carolingian periods of the Middle Ages, the use of reliquaries was common throughout the whole Church. The Church strived to keep the use of relics in perspective. In his Letter to Riparius, St. Jerome (d. 420) wrote in defense of relics: "We do not worship, we do not adore, for fear that we should bow down to the creature rather than to the Creator, but we venerate the relics of the martyrs in order the better to adore Him whose martyrs they are."<br>  <br>  During the Middle Ages, the "translation of relics," meaning the removal of relics from the tombs, their placement in reliquaries and their dispersal, grew. Sadly, abuses grew also. With various barbarian invasions, the conquests of the Crusades, the lack of means for verifying all relics and less than reputable individuals who in their greed preyed on the ignorant and the superstitious, abuses did occur. Even St. Augustine (d. 430) denounced impostors who dressed as monks selling spurious relics of saints. Pope St. Gregory (d. 604) forbade the selling of relics and the disruption of tombs in the catacombs. Unfortunately, the popes or other religious authorities were powerless in trying to control the translation of relics or prevent forgeries. Eventually, these abuses prompted the Protestant leaders to attack the idea of relics totally. Unfortunately, the abuses and the negative reaction surrounding relics has led many people to this day to be skeptical about relics.<br>  <br>  In response, the Council of Trent (1563) defended invoking the prayers of the saints and venerating their relics and burial places. "The sacred bodies of the holy martyrs and of the other saints living with Christ, which have been living members of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit and which are destined to be raised and glorified by Him unto life eternal, should also be venerated by the faithful. Through them, many benefits are granted to men by God." Since that time, the Church has taken stringent measures to ensure the proper preservation and veneration of relics. The Code of Canon Law (No. 1190) absolutely forbids the selling of sacred relics. The Code also supports the proper place for relics in our Catholic practice. Canon 1237 states, "The ancient tradition of keeping the relics of martyrs and other saints under a fixed altar is to be preserved according to the norms given in the liturgical books" (a practice widespread since the fourth century). Many churches also have relics of their patron saints which the faithful venerate upon appropriate occasions. And yes, reports of the Lord's miracles and favors continue to be connected with the intercession of a saint and the veneration of his relics. In all, relics remind us of the holiness of a saint and his cooperation in God's work. At the same time, relics inspire us to ask for the prayers of that saint and to beg the grace of God to live the same kind of faith-filled life.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Some most certainly do have supernatural qualities, as evidenced here:<br>  <br>  2Ki 13:20  And Eliseus died, and they buried him.

2OO9U8o9aa	Just be honest with him and say that you are happy to be friends and still confide in him but you are not ready for a full blown (oops!) relationship . It is good that at 16 you have been able to experiment a bit , but if he is experienced you need to be careful even with a BJ . At 16 you could still be unsure of you sexuality and lots of young guys do have the odd fling with another guy and then settle to date girls <br>  However if you do tell him you do not want a relationship you  should bear in mind that it would be wrong of you to just use him occasionally when you feel like being blown and he is handy <br>  Whatever you do just be as honest as you can     and also sensitively|`|iHiwe2Zraa	if your still experimenting then your bi-curious not fully bisexual um yea best thing to do is tell him now that you just are trying stuff and arent sure if you want a relationship with a guy right now|`|AA12158476	Tread lightly. Let him know you as best you can, that you are not ready for a "relationship" and you will definitely have to stop the "benefits" so not to be giving off mixed signals.

But do not lie and say you forgot, just don't mention it.  She probably isn't smart enough to look on the postmark to see when it was sent anyway.

TjPwxbuJaa	I obviously don't know him, but it is possible. I was married (when I was in denial and trying to follow what I thought was "God's word"). I appear very masculine, I've been a volunteer firefighter, into fitness, I've worked on cars and have worked out at least 5 times per week for years (it's a great place to check out hot guys). I was never anti-gay, though, and certainly didn't beat anybody. Nobody ever called me a f***got (nobody does still; I guess being 6'3" and 225 pounds of muscle makes people think twice), so I was never tested in that way. I have heard that many closet cases are homophobic as a way to "prove" to others that they aren't how they feel they are.<br>  Also, having sex with my wife was very difficult for me. I tried my best to be a good husband, but I just couldn't be what she needed, and she couldn't for me either. The good news: she is married again, and I have a partner and we are both happy and still talk all of the time.<br>  I know many gay men like myself who were once married, so being married to a women hardly proves heterosexuality.<br>  I do suggest that you try to bring up some of your concerns with him. At the very least the lack of sex. Don't be too blunt as he will likely react strongly, or even violently, since, if he is indeed gay, he is clearly still deep in the closet.<br>  Best of luck. Regardless of whether he is gay or straight, his love for you is most likely genuine.|`|PIUX1oVWaa	In my opinion he is gaay<br>  or starting to be gay<br>  maybe he is bi<br>  but talk to him<br>  maybe you're being paranoid|`|G9R6VZOXaa	I think you need to ask him.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely nothing you've told us that makes me think he's gay.  Sounds just like millions of other married men|`|W545hqrpaa	ask him sweetie.|`|NWopkX4baa	Anyone who goes out of their way to condemn homosexuality, and beats someone senseless over a silly insult, has some issues with their own sexuality. <br>  <br>  Studies have been done that prove homophobic men are turned on by homosexuality. They hate it so much because they hate what they see in themselves. <br>  <br>  I think you need to have a serious talk with him. It doesn't necessarily mean the end of your marraige, there are ways you can make compromises and agreements.|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	I think he is gay.  But he may not have admitted it to himself yet.  The only thing I would be concerned about would be if he took on a sexually active relationship with a boyfriend.  They you would have to have protected sex.  You may want to approach him from that angle.  But I think I would get him into counseling with you and talk about this in front of a neutral party.  Things could get very testy.|`|5iiQnjE2aa	first-how open is your husband to talking and opening up? b/c you have some questions to ask.<br>  <br>  a lot of guys claim the rabid anti-gay is obviously gay himself. while that is sometimes true, it's not always. strong feelings agains homosexuality can arise if someone is abused or molested in their youth. That might be a good question to ask. or, maybe a former friend or family member who is gay did something negative to him, and he associates that act to all homosexuals. regardless, he's prejudiced and most prejudices arise from ignorance or false associations.<br>  <br>  the lack of sex doesn't mean he's gay. he may be sexually frustrated, or maybe (see above) it's the result of previous molestation. he may be withholding intimacy for varied reasons. get thee to a marriage counselor! if he won't agree to that, why not a pastor or rabbi.  You mention he has a cache of porn-maybe that's something the two of you can share and build on to create greater intimacy between the two of you.<br>  <br>  it's kind of strange that someone as anti-gay would comment on another man's physique.  but since he's into fitness, maybe he is just appreciating other's efforts.<br>  <br>  Your original question-is your husband gay? i honestly don't know. there's evidence that might point in that direction, but it's certainly not the only possible explanation for everything you've listed. Communicate with your husband and try to figure him out more. without it, you'll be in for a lifetime of doubt and suspicion and in the end it's not worth it to live through that.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6a9AfhsLaa	Well, I've realized with most of the guys I know, that the ones  that seem so adamant at "fighting" homosexuality are those most afraid of it, because they know deep down they have their own fascinations with it, and do not want to come to terms with it. Not all, but most, and thats the guys that I know. Thats one of the reasons I despise men so much, is the overwhelming power testosterone has on the mind for dominance and , um, power, for lack of a better word. They want to be in control of everything, but they cannot control what they do not understand. (This is not 100% accurate, but definitely occurs more times than most want to admit. <br>  You may just be paranoid. Regardless of his sexuality, your relationship is not healthy in that department, and you should try couples therapy to try to find out what is going on. At least talk to him about it. I however admire what you said about loving him and wanting him happy. Not a lot of people are like that anymore. <br>  He definitely is showing tendencies on the outside, but that does not necessarily mean anything. Talk to him about it, maybe try couples therapy. But after hearing your story about your cousin, be careful. Good luck.|`|7b12028209a96a4b55756040dd275aebaa	1  .... I think he truly hates gays .... nothing new there<br>  <br>  #2 .... Some straight fellas don't like the girl on girl action ... they prefer to see something getting pounded ... he's not necessarily looking at it for the willies.<br>  <br>  #3 .... That is something you need to discuss with him ... maybe you've let yourself go and he's not attracted to you anymore after you've given birth.  It happens<br>  <br>  #4 ....  It's a bromance ...leave it<br>  <br>  #5  .... He doesn't want the man ... he wants the abs/chest ... he wants your reaction on whether you would say "Honey, you look just as amazing"  <br>  <br>  You both need to talk .... this whole questioning his sexuality isn't healthy !!!  Good luck|`|Qu1nTLz4aa	Of course I can't say 100%, since I don't know him. I can tell you that very homophobic men might be attracted to men.<br>  <br>  My ex-husband was so homophobic. It was weird, because at first, when we were dating, it didn't come up much. I think he made a stupid comment and I told him that that was stupid and he couldn't gay-bash around my family, because I'd be embarrassed.<br>  <br>  When I got pregnant and we got married, strange things happened. He got very depressed, he became very, very homophobic (I told him that he thought about gay sex more than horny gay men did), he started using drugs, and gay men started confronting me!!!<br>  <br>  One in particular came up to me, drunk and crying, when I was 9 months pregnant at a party, and started yelling at me that I wouldn't let my husband be himself or see his friends. I had never seen him before. I thought I knew my husband's friends.<br>  <br>  I asked my husband about it on several occasions and he denied everything.<br>  <br>  Then, a couple of years later he announced, as I recovered from a c-section, that he wanted to live as a girl and he wanted to stay home with the baby and he wanted me to get a job. Pronto.<br>  <br>  Well, this all happened about 9 years ago. Now he says he's a girl on MySpace, he wears nail polish, and he still dates women. <br>  <br>  Is your husband gay? He really could be. Or bi. I would urge you to figure this out before you have another child, if you are going to go your separate ways.<br>  <br>  Some gay men get married to a woman just to take a stab at it, I think. Or to make their parents happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think whether or not he is gay is pretty irrelevant to your marriage.  What is relevant is your experience of being sexually unfulfilled.  Address that issue with him.  Tell him how many times you want sex per month, and then negotiate a compromise.  And if you want the light on during sex, turn it on, for crying out loud.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	I guess my concern is why you're 'online' asking who knows who personal questions like this when, most likely, none of us even know him...or that we are all knowledgeable enough to respond reasonably to your query...when you should be 'doing your research' and COMMUNICATING your concerns with him...  I would advise you to FIRST do your homework...READ about homosexuality and bisexuality...specifically anything you can find about the 'psychological' aspects...  One of the comments you make is that your husband becomes VERY irate...which is a HUGE clue...as, psychologically speaking, anyone who becomes that 'upset' about homosexuality is usually 'gay' themselves and trying to throw the focus away from themselves...or...at least insecure in their own sexual identity...  So...do your homework...speak with your family doctor and/or a professional psychologist...and THEN speak with your husband.  You 'definitely' will want to be careful as your 'questions' (which he may see as either 'prying' or as a 'personal attack' upon his masculinity) MAY evoke a violent, possibly physical, reaction...  Possibly a 'better idea' would be for you to 'do your homework' and then schedule an appointment with a professional psychologist, keeping in mind that your safety is of GREAT IMPORTANCE...|`|sXnoIFRsaa	Here is how I see it, if you think he is gay most likely he is.  Not necessarily by what you listed here but hey you are his wife and you know him better then anyone.  You do not often hear straight Men commenting on other Men's physiques, the amount of Porn and his self pleasuring is of concern being that he does not want to have intimacy with you.  The part where he beat your cousin down after he called him a derogatory name is a huge red flag.  Guys that are comfortable in their own sexuality would just laugh it off.<br>  You have some red flags and most of all your questioning it which is of serious concern.  The real question here is how do you broach the subject without this turning into a huge issue.  My suggestion to you is to start a conversation with him in order to begin the dialog of your concerns.  A suggestion would be to say that you have a a Girl friend whose husband she suspects is Gay see what his reaction is.  Also ask that he invite this new buddy of his over for dinner one night so you can watch to see if there is any chemistry.<br>  I wish you the best of luck and my thoughts are with you|`|P0qTmwtFaa	he could be a closet poof and is so ashamed of his queerness that his reacts violently about them..<br>  <br>  or he genuinely just hates gays...<br>  <br>  it's a tough call, but i personally go with the first possibility|`|AA11785060	Not gay at all, he has sex with you. Gay guys don't have sexual relationships with women.  Bisexuals do, however. And he sounds certainly bisexual based on what you have said. And a lousy one at that, if he is so anti-gay that he would beat someone up.  Not sure why you would be in a relationship with anyone who resorts to vicious violence. Especially since you have a child. <br>  Likely he is not yet having sex with the other guy, but also very likely it will happen soon. Most bisexuals tend to "come out" a few years after trying a relationship with a woman. Some have great relationships and sex with both males and females, but certainly typical that a bisexual guy especially one hung up on physical looks will steer more towards guys that he is attracted to.  <br>  By the way, most guys don't have lesbian porn, straight porn is way more popular.  Of course, you know the reason why, now.

A liberal can lampoon conservative beliefs, but should not make personal attacks.  Similarly, the conservative can lampoon liberal beliefs, but should not make personal attacks.<br>   <br>  I think it is fair for atheists to discuss how ludicrous we find the concept of God.  We find the idea of the Christian God as silly as you would find Allah, Shiva, Zeus, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster. We feel free to insult God, because we are insulting someone that does not exist.  We shouldn't make personal attacks on Christians, however.  Unfortunately some of us do.<br>   <br>  We do find some things Christians say rather insulting.  For instance they are constantly quoting the Bible saying:  "The fools has said in his heart there is no God."  If we are called fools we should be able to call fool back. <br>  <br>   <br>  We also find it somewhat insulting when you suggest we have no morals because we don't believe in God.

God speaks to us through an open, humble heart. Once we can push away the hurt and the pride, He is able to speak to us, and we are able to hear Him."  I used to be a Christian.

If your beliefs, which have no evidence of any kind to back them up, can't stand up to a little examination and criticism, what good are they?  <br>  <br>  Basically you're arguing that everybody should just shut up and accept your beliefs just because you have them.  I don't agree with that argument -- and I'm perfectly happy to say why.  The only way to find "truth" is to look at all sides of an issue, and make a decision based on the evidence for and against an idea...not to just blindly accept a belief because you like it or because somebody says it's true.<br>  <br>  Peace.

FOzN3xwzaa	That sin is unbelief, and it is the worst sin of all. <br>  <br>  To be forgiven of it, believe in Jesus alone for salvation, and then all your sins are forgiven, all sins past, present, and future, no matter what those sins are, and then you WILL be in heaven, no matter what!  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I'm not sure that is a sin, can you elaborate a bit?|`|0EkJQEV9aa	dispair|`|3KD6RRhPaa	The biggest sin that man can commit is to reject God's great love with the powerful gospel of the water and the Spirit (John 3:3-5). You must have the correct understanding of this gospel, for it is Jesus water baptism by John the Baptist, and His death on the Cross. The water here has nothing to do with our water baptism, but everything to do with Jesus' babtism.

I love my Scottish heritage but trust me, I would greatly resent a massive invasion of Scots which took our jobs and greatly increased the cost of government services.  I'm from Texas, a state rich in Spanish and Mexican heritage.  Spanish exploration began around 1690.  We remained a Spanish colony until 1821 when we along with Mexico fought and won independence.  We then were a Mexican colony until 1836 when we won our independence from Mexico.  Spanish and Mexican heritage is very evident and treasured throughout Texas.

I went out with that guy for about 3 years and we both learned a lot from each other . That included a few weekends away and a couple of longer holidays .

aWHvHIr1aa	I struggle with the fact that the Jewish calendar is a lunar calendar and no one else seems to want to recognize the implications of that fact.  <br>  ***The history of a Jewish Calendar is divided into three periods: the Biblical, the Talmudic, and the post Talmudic. During the Biblical period the understanding of the Calendar was based entirely upon the observation of the sun and the moon.***<br>  <a href="http://www.bible-history.com/jewishyear/jewishyear_history_of_the_calendar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-history.com/jewishyear/...</a><br>  <br>  ***the Hebrew term for "month," chodesh, means "new [moon]," referring to the new moon that began the month. The lunar cycle played a significant role in the cultural and religious life in ancient Israel so that time could be counted by the cycles of the moon (Ex. 19:1). The New Moon was a festival day, observed by burnt offering and sacrifices as well as banquets (Num 29:6, 1 Sam 20:5, 1 Chron 23:31). The New Moon festival was often listed along with Sabbath as an important religious observance (2 Kings 4:23, Ezek 45:17).***<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cresourcei.org/calendar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cresourcei.org/calendar.html</a><br>  <br>  ***Months are either 29 or 30 days, corresponding to the 29?-day lunar cycle. Years are either 12 or 13 months, corresponding to the 12.4 month solar cycle. <br>  <br>  The lunar month on the Jewish calendar begins when the first sliver of moon becomes visible after the dark of the moon. In ancient times, the new months used to be determined by observation. When people observed the new moon, they would notify the Sanhedrin. When the Sanhedrin heard testimony from two independent, reliable eyewitnesses that the new moon occurred on a certain date, they would declare the rosh chodesh (first of the month) and send out messengers to tell people when the month began. <br>  <br>  The problem with strictly lunar calendars is that there are approximately 12.4 lunar months in every solar year, so a 12-month lunar calendar is about 11 days shorter than a solar year and a 13-month lunar is about 19 longer than a solar year. The months drift around the seasons on such a calendar: on a 12-month lunar calendar, the month of Nissan, which is supposed to occur in the Spring, would occur 11 days earlier in the season each year, eventually occurring in the Winter, the Fall, the Summer, and then the Spring again. On a 13-month lunar calendar, the same thing would happen in the other direction, and faster. <br>  <br>  To compensate for this drift, the Jewish calendar uses a 12-month lunar calendar with an extra month occasionally added. The month of Nissan occurs 11 days earlier each year for two or three years, and then jumps forward 30 days, balancing out the drift. <br>  <br>  In ancient times, this month was added by observation: the Sanhedrin observed the conditions of the weather, the crops and the livestock, and if these were not sufficiently advanced to be considered "spring," then the Sanhedrin inserted an additional month into the calendar to make sure that Pesach (Passover) would occur in the spring (it is, after all, referred to in the Torah as Chag he-Aviv, the Festival of Spring!).***<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm</a><br>  <br>  It wasn't till the 4th century or over 2000 years of ***declaring  the rosh chodesh (first of the month) because the Sanhedrin heard testimony from two independent and sending out messengers to tell people when the month began***  and inserting an ***additional month into the calendar to make sure that Pesach (Passover) would occur in the spring***<br>  <br>  So to what proof exists that would support the theory that today's Sabbath is the same as the first one when all the evidence lines up against this belief.<br>  <br>  As an illustration, look at the Passover.  Passover is to be on the 14th day of the month or a full moon.  Here is the Passover for the next couple of years.<br>  <br>  Passover website:<br>  <a href="http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/...</a><br>  <br>  ***2009: April 9-16 Passover starts on Wednesday<br>  2010: March 30-April 6 Passover starts on Monday<br>  2011: April 19-26 Passover starts on Monday<br>  2012: April 7-14 Passover starts on Friday<br>  2013: March 26-April 2 Passover starts on Monday<br>  2014: April 15-22 Passover starts on Monday<br>  2015: April 4-11 Passover starts on Thursday<br>  <br>  Note: The Jewish calendar date begins at sundown of the night beforehand. Thus all holiday observances – including the first seder – begin the night before the dates listed. Jewish calendar dates also conclude at nightfall.***<br>  <br>  So, if the 14th day bounces around to every day of the week, the 7th does too.  This is because ***a 12-month lunar calendar is about 11 days shorter than a solar year and a 13-month lunar is about 19 longer than a solar year.***  <br>  <br>  Those celebrating the Sabbath by the Gregorian calendar can not make the adjustments needed to observing Passover on the 14th day of the month and the Sabbath on the 7th day of the month on a lunar calendar which starts with a new moon every month.  If they wanted to observe the way it was done in the Bible, the the post Biblical calendar observance would need to go away with the dogmatic ideals so they could conform to the flexible lunar calendar.<br>  <br>  Once this is done, one can understand why the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|AA11849917	The struggle lies in the fact that most Christians who DO observe the Jewish Sabbath don't know the first thing about it!  They made up their OWN rules and dismissed God's!<br>  <br>  Ask any orthodox Jewish Rabbi what it means to keep the Sabbath.  You'll think twice before you put yourself under THAT burden.  But "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having been made a curse FOR us, just as it is written, 'cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree' ... "<br>  <br>  But, according to another Jewish Rabbi who fully understood that the Jewish Law consists of 613 commandments, not just one, Paul said that if you LIVE by Law, you will be JUDGED by Law, and if you break even the SMALLEST Law, you're guilty of ALL!<br>  <br>  The Law says that you are to work SIX days (at your occupation), and rest ONE day.  Do YOU?  If not, you've broken the Law, and you will be judged by it!  ("The wages of sin is death" and "The soul that sins shall die!")<br>  <br>  The problem with keeping the Sabbath is a pride thing.<br>  <br>  It's like saying that I kept the Law, now God owes me.<br>  <br>  It doesn't take into account that "you are saved by grace, through faith. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast".<br>  <br>  "Then where is the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the Law." (Rom 3:27-28 MKJV)<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  "Therefore I have boasting in Christ Jesus as to the things pertaining to God." (Rom 15:17 MKJV)<br>  <br>  and finally,<br>  <br>  "though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinks that he has reason to trust in the flesh, I more. I was circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews. As regards the Law, I was a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; regarding the righteousness in the Law, blameless. But whatever things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. But no, rather, I also count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them to be dung, so that I may win Christ and be found in Him; not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but through the faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith, that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable to His death; if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead."

In the last days, there will supposedly be a national Sunday law and if you don’t honor the Sabbath, you will go to Hell.  Now that wouldn’t be such a problem, if there was some clear understanding about what exactly one has to do in order to “honor the Sabbath.”  However, there are no clear rules and SDAs often quarrel over what is (or is not) acceptable on the Sabbath.  Over the years, the church has experienced many splits over this (and other) issues.  <br>  <br>  Another issue is the authority of Ellen G. White.  Before this woman was exposed as a plagerist (among many other shortcomings), all one needed to do is check her writings to be sure about Sabbath Keeping – since she explained the difference between “ceremonial” Sabbath keeping and the required elements.  However, since her status has been downgraded, it’s no longer so clear.  <br>  <br>  This had led to much concern about salvation.  A 2002 survey of Adventists worldwide showed that more than 30 percent of them thought that if they died today, they would go to Hell.|`|gYx1FgqLaa	going to church, im always tired, i no longer go to the early morning church anymore...|`|e66f1ef8d569cc63ffe5d9474c957b12aa	Staying up too late the night before and not wanting to get our lazy @sses out of bed.|`|mFGyonmTaa	When to get some sleep and when to drag themselves to church...

It rejoices in the good and does its best to see the good in each other. <br>  <br>  I don't know you,  so I can't comment on your relationship much..that is why I ask these questions.. to give you something to think about. <br>  <br>  As yourself this.. Did you know he was Catholic when you started dating?  Therefore is it fair, even if he was not devout, to fault him for following his beliefs,  however sudden they appear to you?...assuming you knew he was Catholic from the start.<br>  <br>  In either case,  IF you can not LOVE and respect this aspect of him (his beliefs and religious practices)  -- then maybe you are 2 different people moving in different directions.  As hard as it is to walk away,  better that you realize you have different views NOW and separate then after you have kids,  or get married, etc. etc. <br>  <br>  IF you decide to stay with him,...then you should embrace and accept the beliefs he has, since you made that decision. He should not be made to feel guilty or bad for following what he believes is right. -- You should LOVE that about him. <br>  Respecting him means respecting ALL of him... including his beliefs. <br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  NOW,  as for not having sex......<br>  <br>  Think about it this way.. forgoing sex is a wonderful opportunity to explore other means of expressing your feelings. Communicating your love verbally, in writing, etc. <br>  It could be that once you expressed your love physically, early on in your relationship.. the emotional and non-physical aspects of your relationship took back stage.  You slipped into a comfort zone where you primarily communicated intimacy physically. I've even seen couples who's emotional maturity has stagnated because they introduced sex early on itnto their relationship.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what MANY people think, sex is NOT a required component of a long term relationship.  Many people introduce it way too early into the relationship and it is a source of a lot of insecurity and emotional trauma according to relationship counselors.  Many counselors admit that breaking up from a sexual relationship is a lot like getting a divorce.  People, particularly women, often times go thru the same sort of depression and self esteem issues as people going thru a divorce. <br>  _____________________<br>  <br>  Why do you think he is "just doing this to be stupid" and it is not a sincere attempt at reconnecting with his faith?<br>  <br>  You haven't talked to him about this.. I mean more then just talking about being a moral test and part of Lent?? You didn't mention that you have in the question.  Why did you think to FIRST turn towards a public, open answer forum like Yahoo Answers instead of your boyfriend who you've known for 7 years?  (assuming you didn't talk to him since you didn't mention this in your posting)<br>  <br>  In the end,  IF you truly love him and want to stay with him,  then you essentially have no choice but to love his faith because this is PART of who he is. You need to make a decision and then FOLLOW that decision and respect him. <br>  <br>  If you don't think you can do that...if the sex drive controls you and you can't live without it.. then break up and find someone else. <br>  <br>  It would be morally and ethically  wrong to sabotage someone's beliefs to suit your own desires.|`|dPuWIWj6aa	Depending how old he (you) are I think it is a bunch of bull.

Have you noticed any other changes in behaviour from your bf?  Maybe he really does just want to "test his morality" by becoming celibate for Lent, in which case there is nothing to worry about.  But, since you say he doesn't observe lent or ash wed, it puzzles me why he's suddenly interested in trying this.  Have you complained about his decision?  Is it at all possible he's hoping you'll break up with him over this and that he won't have to be the one to break up?  That's why I asked if you noticed any other changes in behaviour.   I hope everything works out.

Also depends on the girl.<br>  <br>  And yes girls do stare at ugly people too. Either to wonder why they are there and commit the horror to memory to tell in a tale later (ie make fun of him - ppl out there thinking I am a bitc* shut up you know you do it).

UrYYKkGoaa	I find anything to do with entertainment fun. <br>  <br>  *Volunteering in the "green room" of a musical or sporting event. The green room is where performers and competitors go to relax when they aren't working at an event.<br>  <br>  *Doing security, traffic control, ticket taking etc at a festival. It's fun to be around people and enjoy the event close up and for free.<br>  <br>  *Postering or setting up for a big event. There are large groups of volunteers all working together, which is very fun, and they usually feed you, so it's like a big fun work party with your friends.<br>  <br>  *Volunteering for fundraising events or at the after party for an event. It's a hoot working behind the bar or passing out hors d'oeuvres at a big event where everyone is having fun AND doing something worthwhile!<br>  <br>  *Also, there are actually lots of opportunities to volunteer at major sporting events. If you have any sports teams you're interested in in your city or town, find out about volunteering selling 50/50 charity tickets, volunteering at the lost and found, volunteering to help direct people, etc. You'll get to see the sporting event for free. The same is true for major concerts. Even though there's so much money involved with these events, not everyone at these events is paid.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Coaching little league teams of any sport.  Especially the peewees.<br>  No pressure, everyone plays and the young ones antics are hilarious|`|J5zj8dWRaa	It depends on your definition of "fun":<br>  <br>  *  Most things that deal with kids - babysitting, tutoring, coaching, mentoring, reading<br>  <br>  *  Cleaning up parks and such - picking up litter, painting, planting, raking<br>  <br>  *  Helping the elderly and/or disabled - running errands, taking them on errands, helping around their house, just listening to their stories and keeping them company for a while|`|AA11607886	The Scouts are currently looking for more volunteers at the moment to help out with Scouts groups.<br>  <br>  Obviously it depends what you class as fun - but the Scouts have a very varied programme and can do some really exciting stuff! - Anything from kayaking to rock climbing to trekking... anything like that!!<br>  <br>  Volunteering would only be helping out with one unit when they meet weekly, and of course you get to join in the fun without having to work for the badges! You might not even need to wear a uniform at all!<br>  <br>  If you're interested, there's a site where you can get more information:<br>  www.jointheadventure.com<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

By following that inspiration that comes to them, the answer of what to do to work out the dysfunction, which they really do not want to do because one would rather not change, I mean giving up some aspect of ones personality, why it’s a little like dying they think for isn’t that what death is?

He to whom experiences have clearly shown the past exemplary punishments (given by Allah to peoples) is prevented by piety from falling into doubts. You should know that the same troubles have returned to you which existed when the Prophet was first sent. <br>  <br>  By Allah who sent the Prophet with faith and truth you will be severely subverted, bitterly shaken as in sieving and fully mixed as by spooning in a cooking pot till your low persons become high and high ones become low, those who were behind would attain forward positions and those who were forward would become backward. By Allah, I have not concealed a single word or spoken any lie and I had been informed of this event and of this time. <br>  <br>  Beware that sins are like unruly horses on whom their riders have been placed and their reins have been let loose so that they would jump with them in Hell. Beware that piety is like trained horses on whom the riders have been placed with the reins in their hands, so that they would take the riders to heaven. There is right and wrong and there are followers for each. If wrong dominates, it has (always) in the past been so, and if truth goes down that too has often occurred. It seldom happens that a thing that lags behind comes forward.<br>  <br>  He who has heaven and hell in his view has no other aim. He who attempts and acts quickly, succeeds, while the seeker who is slow may also entertain hope, and he who falls short of action faces destruction in Hell. On right and left there are misleading paths. Only the middle way is the (right) path which is the Everlasting Book and the traditions of the Prophet. From it the sunnah has spread out and towards it is the eventual return. <br>  <br>  He who claims (otherwise) is ruined and he who concocts falsehood is disappointed. He who opposes(1) right with his face gets destruction. It is enough ignorance for a man not to know himself. He who is strong rooted(2) in piety does not get destruction, and the plantation of a people based on piety never remains without water. Hide yourselves in your houses and reform yourselves.

423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	Interesting Quiz ! The answer is....<br>  <br>  The Verse of Affection (Muwaddah)<br>  <br>  "Say, I do not ask from you any reward for it (preaching the message) but love for my relatives (qurba which here refers to the Ahlul Bayt)" (Noble Quran, 42:23)....[1]<br>  <br>  When explaining this verse, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi says, “Without doubt, no one was as near to the Prophet as Lady Fatima, Ali, Hassan, and Husayn. This is a well-known fact for all the chains of narration, that these were his 'al'.” Thus, 'al' or 'ahl' refers only to the immediate family of the Prophet—namely: Lady Fatima, Ali, Hassan, and Husayn.<br>  <br>  Some argue that Hassan and Husayn were not the sons of the Prophet because they were the sons of Imam Ali. According to old Arab custom, the mother was considered as only a means to deliver a child, but nonetheless, their direct lineage to the Prophet is through their mother, Lady Fatima al-Zahra. It has been narrated that the 'Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid asked the seventh Imam of the school of Ahlul Bayt, Imam Musa ibn Ja'far how he could attribute himself to the Prophet while he was the child of Ali and Lady Fatima - thus, how could he be related to the Prophet? The Imam then cited to him a verse that refers to the descendants of Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim), “And from his progeny were David (Dawud), Solomon (Sulayman), Job (Ayyub), Joseph (Yusuf), Moses (Musa), and Aaron (Harun)—thus do We reward the good-doers—and Zachariah (Zakariyya), and John (Yahya), and Jesus (Isaa), and Elias (Ilyas)—each one of them was of the righteous.”[2] The Imam then asked the caliph who the father of Isaa (Jesus) was. Harun answered that he was fatherless. The Imam replied, “Then you can see that Allah linked him to Ibrahim through his mother, Mary and Allah did the same for us, linking us to Prophet Muhammad through our mother Lady Fatima al-Zahra.”[3]<br>  <br>  In many instances, the Prophet refers to Lady Fatima with intense love and affection, such as when he says, “Fatima is a part of me. Her happiness is my happiness, and her pain is my pain.” The Prophet would also point towards the children of Fatima - Hassan and Husayn - and say on many occasions, “These are my sons,” or “This is my son.” That is why the community of the companions in Madina referred to both Hassan and Husayn as the 'sons of Prophet Muhammad.'<br>  <br>  REFERENCES:<br>  <br>  [1] Sahih Muslim; Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal; Ibn Hajar, Sawa?iq.

There is no phrase in this du’aa’ like “al-darajah al-‘aaliyah al-rafee’ah (the high and elevated status),” so this should not be said. The conjunction “wa” in the phrase “al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah (the privilege and also the eminence) is by way of explanation; waseelah is the status higher than the rest of creation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained it in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, who said that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “When you hear the muezzin and say something like he says, then send blessings on me, whoever sends blessings on me, Allaah will send blessings tenfold on him. Then ask Allaah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a status in Paradise that only one of the slaves of Allaah will reach, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me will be granted intercession.” (Reported by Muslim, 577).<br>  <br>  <br>  - how do i work? hmmm not doing my best thats what i can say.<br>  but i ask ALLAH(swt) to guide us all to what HE(swt) love.amiin amin amin.<br>  <br>  <br>  @asker: ur welcome...<br>  <br>  but are u sure u dont mean the verse in quouran when ALLAH(swt)..ok i dont memrize the verse, where ALLAH(swt) tell us to send peace and blessings upon the prophet(alayhi salat wa salam)...like the angles do ????<br>  <br>  if not so im curious to know....i'll be back in sha'aa LLAH to know the answer.<br>  <br>  @asker: another try: ........................NOTHING, he want nothing from us..bcz he's reward will be from ALLAH(swt) and we do nothing to him????<br>  <br>  yes??? ok i feel a NO is coming....|`|4aveC2aaaa	The Qu'ran says: Qur'an 4: 64 "We sent not a messenger but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will of Allah."

Phobias are irrational fears and a fear of something that's not inherently threatening because someone is uninformed seems, at least to me, irrational. Therefore, homophobia is an accurate term. <br>  <br>  What hierarchy? Being straight means you're a better person than a homosexual? That doesn't even begin to make sense. Get over it, we're all people. These people tell you that they're not afraid of the GLBT community because they don't want to be labeled as homophobic, largely because there's a huge stigma attached to that word; using that word to self-identify means that you, yourself, acknowledge the hate inherent therein, which necessarily implicates a kind of self-loathing for harboring that hate at all.|`|NwXnzARwaa	Phobia means "strong fear or dislike."<br>  <br>  Since most homophobic people exhibit a strong dislike of gay people, they are accurately referred to as homophobic.<br>  <br>  The definition of homophobic is "showing an irrational hatred, disapproval, or fear of homosexuality, gay and lesbian people, or their culture," which also accurately portrays the attitudes as well as the actions of homophobic people.|`|R2U7SP3zaa	How about people stop being homophobic and we can stop worrying about the word?<br>  <br>  *Would you call people who don't have a problem with homosexuals 'homo-tolerant' ?|`|8OXVSoe0aa	phobia means: extreme hate or fear of something. <br>  So homophobia seems pretty appropriate|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	no they  arent  afraid  of  us they just  hate  us  .. yes  that  is so  much  better.<br>  <br>    why  didnt  we  think of  that  when  we  coined  the  phrase|`|yjSvzCQLaa	I feel like i have heard this many times before :(|`|7U0hQ1VPaa	how about f*ck faces on parade?|`|bRRNYsK8aa	i agree, i'd have to say. i never was one to go along with this whole " phobia " suffix. i mean, it doesn't make much sense, eh.? lol. homophobes aren't [scared] of homosexual pplz, they just don't [like] them. & there, my friend, is a huge difference between the two. :P<br>  <br>  i suppose it makes sense though ... how'd it come into play in the natural, current world of modern reality. back in - God knows what time period. xD - the meaning of the word had made quite a bit of sense to pplz ... because ... well, it actually was a diagnosed phobia due to religious values & direct fear of anyone different from them.

On that date, a large asteroid is going to come within several thousand miles of the Earth, below the altitude of our geosynchronous satellites' orbit, and will be visible to the naked eye.  If something happens between then and now which changes the tragectory of this object, it could have devastating effects for humanity.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oh, 2 billion,  ... well, maybe, depending on what you consider to be "the end", but humans will probably be long gone by then.|`|J4lfOSPiaa	Kevin A.R.T., I am a little confused by your question and your modifiers to explain a scenario you claim will happen 2 Billion years from now!?

Life will always pop up where the conditions allow. The sun will destroy the earth, and eventually we'll all get sucked into the giant black hole in the center of the galaxy- everything will stop. But somewhere else in the universe, where the conditions will allow- matter will organize into a complexity similar to what we experience here and now. Life on earth will be completely destroyed eventually, even if we escape our sun and go to some other solar system, eventually everything will die. So people should stop whining about 2012 and all that garbage- I like your question.|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	Impossible to the knowledge you have its flawed and tainted<br>  <br>  Jesus put Al Jinn in the swine, anyone eating it is also taking in Al Jinn = the spirits.

Who died on the cross? Was it Jesus-the-god, or was it Jesus-the-human? If it was Jesus-the-god, Jews don't believe that God can die. If it was Jesus-the-human, then all Christians have in the death of Jesus was a human death, a human sacrifice. Jews believe that God hates the very idea of human sacrifice.<br>   <br>  Jews believe that one is born into the world with original purity, and not with original sin. Jews do not believe in original sin.<br>  <br>  Jews believe that God is one and indivisible. Jews do not believe in a trinity.<br>  <br>  Jews believe in The Satan, but not in a devil.

If you can listen participate in discussions and get good grades on the tests... FINE.  <br>  Ya don't need homework to prove ya know it..that's what tests are for. <br>  <br>  I'd also do exactly like my Ecology professor did...<br>  <br>  #1)) 10 point Quizzes.. a different type of quiz each week. <br>  <br>  1) Gambler's special - 2 extra points if you take it close book,  OR take it open book and just get whatever score you get.  Your gamble - potentially able to get 12 out of 10 points if you ace the quiz closed book<br>  <br>  2) Open Class, closed book - class if free to shout out answers or ask each other for help.  How well do you TRUST your classmates?<br>  <br>  3) Open Book, closed classroom -- everyone is quiet, but you are free to use your own book to look up answers.<br>  <br>  4) Regular -- closed book, closed classroom, just shut up and take the dang test!<br>  <br>  #2)))  Some True and False questions would have only 1 answer.. True OR false.  Like the following:  Fertilizer run off can cause eutrophication of aquatic environments? TRUE<br>  These questions are so that SOME students at least learn some key lessons that the professor wants to DRIVE into your skull before you leave the class..so you at least leave his class with the important ideas.  These "gimmes' would probably appear on EACH test throughout the semester to drive home the point. - Also, even if you completely bombed the test.. you'd get at least 1 point out of 100.  OR, maybe make your NAME the first answer..so you at least, hopefully, get the first question right out of 100. <br>  <br>  #3))) the "Extra Credit" question would be impossible to get right..BUT if someone did.. they'd get an immediate A for the entire semester. <br>  Questions like: Name the color of the carpet in the Professor's room when he grew up? OR,  what did I have for lunch 2 weeks ago? OR what is the password to my network account thru the school? (this last one would also be a test to see if any students had hacked my account? hehehehehe) -- if someone got it right,  immediate A for the semester.  - something like that.  <br>  <br>  That's the type of professor I'd be. -- FUN and unconventional.

jdRKZe18aa	As I've become older and "wiser" and have had now 4 elderly people live and die in my home - I've witnessed an interesting thing.  As they aged and became increasingly less independent and physically able, they DID become more & more child-like.<br>  <br>  SO here's my Linda Theory... if we don't do as Christ implored and "become as a little child" on our own, then life, aging, illness, disease or disability WILL make us become like one, whether we like it or not.  I think there is a simple and pure faith, belief, dependence upon God and purity of heart that comes from having the faith of a little child.....  As we age and usually become cynical, without faith & hope and more selfish and egotistical, more materialistic, more socially influenced - all the things that little children are NOT.  BUT that's just my personal 'doctrine' on the idea.....|`|UinOWcMUaa	Because when we are younger we are more pure and don't have the secular world filling our heads with a bunch of de-sensitized non-sense :)|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	It's because as children we want to believe in Santa and Jesus etc. and that we know no better.<br>  <br>  Of course we stop believing in Santa because we eventually understand that is our parents.

There are homeless people and hungry people who could have been taken care of but instead they built an eyesore to do nothing but irritate the people around them.

a7LvtYi0aa	i never thought that it matered....|`|38e6be03a2ded6d233d80ef88f7561d1aa	Your wife is correct.  You should be out in a restaurant or store and let the phone ring loudly for the world to hear 3 times, then answer.  I'm sure you can detect my sarcasm.  Answer the phone whenever you get to it.  Often times the phone rings on the caller's end before yours. It can throw you off if the person picks up before it rings, but as long as it rings answer it.  This is pretty silly.  I'm not sure how upset your wife gets over this, but I'd say this is a classic example of pick your battles wisely.  If I call somebody, I don't think they are rude for answering in a timely manner.  In my office, we try to answer every call on the first ring.|`|ydPmxntpaa	well....you can't really judge people by the way they answer the phone....but yes people usually expect you to pick it up around the 2-3rd ring.....but if it's a close friend then (in my opinion) i don't think it really matters....so yah....hope that helped|`|X8nVWtqZaa	The phone rings; you answer it.<br>  The person on the other line should already be ready.<br>  Although I tend to wait until the second ring; just out of habit.|`|HFbcfm7xaa	I answer it on the second ring as a rule.

Answer the phone in however many rings it takes to get to the phone.  To me the longer the phone rings means you might be screening either by caller ID or the answering machine.  That is more annoying.  If I am next to the phone and it rings, I answer right away and the caller is ready to talk.|`|gAOAdOHraa	I agree with you in that the caller is already prepared when they make the call.  And I don't think it is rude at all to pick the phone up on the first couple of rings.  However I am with your wife for leaving it ring a little before answering.  Unless I know who is calling I leave it until after the third ring at least so the caller doesn't think that I have no life and all I ever do is sit by the phone all day long waiting for the phone to ring.|`|3becff333a551f4097226dfe2aae0006aa	Sometimes people assume that whatever was normal in their own family was dictated by etiquette, when in fact it arose from that family's particular circumstances.  So, for example, if your wife grew up in a neighborhood of very large houses, where it always took several rings to get to the phone, she might assume that this is what all callers expect.  But etiquette doesn't make that assumption.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I think you are correct.  They should have been prepared when they dialed your number.  I usually give it a few rings anyway though so *I* can prepare what to say.  After about the 3rd ring, I start to get antsy and wonder if I'm going to be talking to a voicemail system.|`|wy54YPuQaa	I'm with you.  The only thing they should be unprepared for is the voice mail/answering machine which can be annoying.|`|AA12204752	I think you should pick it up on the third ring if possible.
sgHvnxe2aa	Because they have nothing "better" to do with their time or energy, but<br>  it IS true though....that without knowing Jesus as Lord and Savior, one CANNOT enter into the kingdom of God.....and people need to know that, so that they WILL know of the choice they have in THIS life to  be saved and go to heaven....We were told by Jesus to be His wit-nesses....and no, the world will NOT like it......OH WELL...but there are still many who WILL hear and receive the good news of God's grace and mercy in the finished work of His Son on the cross...and they have every RIGHT to hear - and receive Jesus as their personal Savior, regardless of who wants to be offended....Paul wrote in Galatians that if he wanted<br>  to be "popular" with men, he would not be preaching the gospel...What<br>  the world thinks does not matter....We are to obey God and not man!!!<br>  <br>  The preaching of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.....<br>  <br>  He who hears you hears Me...He who rejects you rejects Me and he who rejects Me rejects Him Who sent Me. -- Luke 10:16<br>  <br>  These are also the words of Jesus Himself.....He, Who, died for us on<br>  the cross to keep us out of hell...and if there was no hell...WHY then did He willingly lay down His life in our place...going through what He did, especially being forsaken by His own Father, Who could not look upon Him because He, Jesus, had become sin for us...if THIS WORLD<br>  and this MORTAL life was all there was.....but ETERNITY   I S  REAL<br>  and so is HELL.....and the world (lost mankind) NEEDS to know that they are playing a very dangerous game of Russian Roulette with etern-ity and with their immortal souls with every passing moment that they refuse to believe on Jesus.....and we aren't telling the world about just another RELIGION that can be used to pass time or to feel good about one's self...THIS IS ABOUT ETERNITY....and where people will surely<br>  go when they die without knowing Jesus as their Savior....<br>  <br>  "I tell you no, but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish."<br>  -- Luke 13:3,5.   JESUS, the Son of God, said these words...<br>  <br>  The loss of heaven is the greatest pain of hell....and millions are already finding that out.....incredibly tragic.....because Jesus died so that NO ONE would have to go to hell......but God will NEVER force ANYONE to receive His mercy and grace which cost Him EVERYTHING to make possible for us...and even now, He gives EACH<br>  and EVERY ONE of us a CHOICE.....but one can't turn around and blame God for the choice that THEY themselves have made. Salvation<br>  is a FREE and PRECIOUS gift to EVERY single person and it is UP TO every person to receive....God "Sends" Nobody to Hell. Mankind was already condemned because of what Adam did in disobeying and<br>  giving us all over to the control of satan....GOD is NOT the One Who brings death and sin and suffering to this world....He sent His Son out of LOVE and GRACE and MERCY...and mankind is RESPONSIBLE for the choice that they have been given the OPPORTUNITY and the FREEDOM to make while he/she is alive on this earth...which hopefully<br>  be the CHOICE to be SAVED and go to Heaven forever...but nobody is<br>  holding a gun to their head to force them to receive Jesus!!! We cannot<br>  CONVERT  a n y b o d y ....That is what happens by their own choice!!<br>  <br>  Believers can only TELL others about the saving grace of God through His Son Who died for us all on the cross....and let those who have an ear to hear.,.....|`|AA11297267	A lot less EMPTY than the lives of people who believe in a magical-sky daddy despite there being no evidence of any kind to even suggest that such a thing exists, and who spend their entire lives worrying about whether or not they'll get into a heaven that doesn't exist...<br>  <br>  Now *that* is sad and pitiful.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|f5c19a6ec11055d423269c8c414f59f1aa	Let me tell you how boring and pitiful.

If you're working or going to school, you can put a Hershey's kiss (little foil-wrapped chocolates) on everyone's desk. <br>  As for the Mothers and Fathers Days, in our church for instance, on Mother's day, every female gets a flower. It doesn't matter if you have children or not. And the same on Father's day too. If you have someone older that you are close to or admire, you can adopt them as your parent. Or you can bring flowers to an old age home. Many seniors are lonely and don't have anyone that makes them feel special. You'll be surprised how good you can feel with Random Acts of Kindness. It's often a better feeling than receiving a gift yourself. You get to see how you made their day with a simple gesture.

It was inserted to fit their doctrine, not to fit the word of God.  This is not the omnly place they do such things.

Exodus 6:2-3 says Jehovah is the Almighty God:  And God went on to speak to Moses and to say to him: “I am Jehovah. 3?And I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty, but as respects my name Jehovah I did not make myself known to them. <br>  <br>  Jehovah is the only ONE true God. (Deut 6:4; John 17:3) No one created him.  He has no beginning but his son Jesus does have a beginning. --Psalm 90:1-2; Isaiah 43:10.<br>  <br>  Jesus came to be known as God's son not God himself.  Even demons recognized Jesus as the son of God.  The demons (used to be good angels) knew Jesus long before the universe was created.<br>  <br>  Matt 8:29:  And, look! they screamed, saying: “What have we to do with you, Son of God? Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?” <br>  <br>  Matt 28:18 shows that Jesus was given all authority from Jehovah the Father, because the Father chose (anointed) him to save mankind. If Jesus was God himself, he should already have that authority.<br>  <br>  Matt 28:18:  And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. <br>  <br>  Matt 28:18 was the same situation as Joseph when Pharaoh gave him all authority over the land of Egypt but Pharaoh was still above Joseph.<br>  <br>  Genesis 41:38-41:  So Phar′aoh said to his servants: “Can another man be found like this one in whom the spirit of God is?” 39?After that Phar′aoh said to Joseph: “Since God has caused you to know all this, there is no one as discreet and wise as you are. 40?You will personally be over my house, and all my people will obey you implicitly. Only as to the throne shall I be greater than you.” 41?And Phar′aoh added to Joseph: “See, I do place you over all the land of Egypt.” <br>  <br>  People can strongly believe whatever to be their truth but that does not make the truth in the Bible any less true.|`|da6c5cafc30de8635df7962e6e28e764aa	Isaiah 9:6:<br>  “Wonderful Counselor”<br>  <br>  At the time of his miraculous birth, the one born to be the Messiah received the name Jesus, meaning “Jehovah Is Salvation.” But he has other names, prophetic names that outline his key role and his elevated position. One such name is Immanuel, meaning “With Us Is God.” (Isaiah 7:14) Isaiah now describes another prophetic name: “There has been a child born to us, there has been a son given to us; and the princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder. And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6) Consider the rich meaning of this multiple prophetic name.<br>  <br>   A counselor is one who gives counsel, or advice. When on earth Jesus Christ provided wonderful counsel. In the Bible we read that “crowds were astounded at his way of teaching.” (Matthew 7:28) He is a wise and empathetic Counselor, with an extraordinary understanding of human nature. His counsel is not restricted to reprimands or chastisement. More often, it is in the form of instruction and loving advice. Jesus’ counsel is wonderful because it is always wise, perfect, and infallible. When followed, it leads to everlasting life.—John 6:68.<br>  <br>  Jesus’ counsel is not simply the product of his brilliant mind. Rather, he says: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.” (John 7:16) As was the case with Solomon, Jehovah God is the Source of Jesus’ wisdom. (1 Kings 3:7-14; Matthew 12:42) Jesus’ example should motivate teachers and counselors in the Christian congregation always to base their instruction on God’s Word.—Proverbs 21:30.<br>  <br>  “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father”<br>  <br>   Jesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3; Revelation 4:11) In the Scriptures, the word “god” can mean “mighty one” or “strong one.” (Exodus 12:12; Psalm 8:5; 2 Corinthians 4:4) Before Jesus came to earth, he was “a god,” “existing in God’s form.” After his resurrection, he returned to an even higher position in the heavens. (John 1:1; Philippians 2:6-11) Further, the designation “god” carries an additional implication. Judges in Israel were called “gods”—once by Jesus himself. (Psalm 82:6; John 10:35) Jesus is Jehovah’s appointed Judge, “destined to judge the living and the dead.” (2 Timothy 4:1; John 5:30) Clearly, he is well named Mighty God.<br>  <br>   The title “Eternal Father” refers to the Messianic King’s power and authority to give humans the prospect of eternal life on earth. (John 11:25, 26) The legacy of our first parent, Adam, was death. Jesus, the last Adam, “became a life-giving spirit.” (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45; Romans 5:12, 18) Just as Jesus, the Eternal Father, will live forever, so obedient mankind will enjoy the benefits of his fatherhood eternally.—Romans 6:9.<br>  <br>  “Prince of Peace”<br>  <br>   Besides everlasting life, man also needs peace, both with God and with his fellowman. Even today, those subjecting themselves to the rule of the “Prince of Peace” have ‘beaten their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.’ (Isaiah 2:2-4) They do not nurse hatreds because of political, territorial, racial, or economic differences. They are united in the worship of the one true God, Jehovah, and they work to maintain peaceful relations with their neighbors, both inside and outside the congregation.—Galatians 6:10; Ephesians 4:2, 3; 2 Timothy 2:24.<br>  <br>   In God’s due time, Christ will establish on earth a peace that will be global, firmly established, permanent. (Acts 1:7) “To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom in order to establish it firmly and to sustain it by means of justice and by means of righteousness, from now on and to time indefinite.” (Isaiah 9:7a) In exercising his authority as the Prince of Peace, Jesus will not resort to tyrannical means. His subjects will not be stripped of their free will and subjugated by force. Rather, all that he will accomplish will be “by means of justice and by means of righteousness.” What a refreshing change!<br>  <br>   In view of the wonderful implications of Jesus’ prophetic name, Isaiah’s conclusion to this part of his prophecy is truly thrilling. He writes: “The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.” (Isaiah 9:7b) Yes, Jehovah acts with zeal. He does nothing in a halfhearted way. We can be sure that whatever he promises, he will fully accomplish. If anyone, then, longs to enjoy everlasting peace, let him serve Jehovah wholeheartedly. Like Jehovah God and Jesus, the Prince of Peace, may all servants of God be “z|`|AA10554783	two|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	According to the Watchtower of 8/1/1995 Page 13 paragraph 19, they have Jesus for a Father and Jehovah for a Grandfather. At least the second class citizens of their New World Order do.<br>  <br>  Oh an Philippians 2:9 tells us that Jesus Name is the name above every name.  The NWT has tried to pollute the truth of the Word of God by inserting the word [OTHER] into this scripture. But close examination of the Greek shows that it does not belong there.  Amazing how evil this cult's leaders are.  They will have much to answer for.

How can Paul appeal to mediation from others if Jesus is our only mediator?<br>   Because, as St. Paul answers, "this is good, and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim 2:3-4). Therefore, although Jesus is our one mediator, He has charged us to be intercessors, or subordinate mediators with Him.<br>  <br>   Mary is a “co-worker" of God in her role as advocate and intercessor because she prays for us and our well-being, as do the rest of the saints. She does this in a subordinate way to Jesus’ advocacy and mediation. The Scriptures are full of examples of saintly mediation. Since Mary had a unique role in God’s plan of salvation by bringing the Word of God into the world, she can also be called the “ladder of paradise," and the “gate of heaven." She is not the source of paradise or heaven; she is the means by which God made heaven accessible to us through Christ our Lord. It is very common for saints, particularly those in the Middle Ages, to use such loving and flowery language to describe the Blessed Mother.
F1YtrZ9raa	... i would say that you should start off in boston, i am sure that you could find a good agency to start of with, work with them until you have a strong portfolio with pictures of you in different settings, it also depends on what kind of modeling you want to get into, in general even if you are not interested in runway you should make sure that you have a strong walk. After you have worked in boston and other suburban areas, i would say then possibly you could move onto trying your luck in New York, one place i personally say would be good for a Photo shoot would be The point on Marblehead Neck, this is In Marblehead, i like this place because, it has amazing harbor shoots, ie. great place if you want to get the ocean in the back ground, i also would like the Essex street mall (not the mall itself but the walking mall area) In Salem, MA. and there are plenty of places in Boston that could be great. but first off you want to find a agency.<br>  good luck<br>  ~tay|`|X1j7qYkUaa	Well there's agencies, but like the online world, there's a lot more scams. <br>  <br>  It's good to work with an agency when you want to go commercial or try to bank in those bigger casting calls. But having an agent doesn't mean you're guaranteed to get work.<br>  <br>  The market is obviously, undeniably tough. <br>  <br>  However outside of the common perception... <br>  <br>  It's that you'll try anything, go anywhere. Well, with a few personal restraints. <br>  <br>  in addition to an agent or management,<br>  or when you're getting more rejections...<br>  then self promotion will open some doors. <br>  <br>  especially when you want to make this your business. <br>  <br>  Build up your cv and work..<br>  <br>  What I mean by that is ... hunt for anything, everything - paying gigs and non paying gigs. <br>  <br>  Work as an extra in media, music videos, etc... volunteer your pictures to magazines, pose for an art class (not all of them are in the buff), work for indie designers or those attending school... enter contests like IML or Mr. USA. Albeit that might seem a little out of your league right now, and in the latter case, you might want to keep away from anything that could be considered scandalous and particularly more so if you have goals of going mainstream.  <br>  <br>  There's a variety of routes to go in becoming a working model, and more than relying on the main industry. <br>  <br>  And as your body goes, well, you'd do better to tone it up a little more. As is - it will work for a few places, but for even catalog work, they're likely going to want you to be more defined. And a light tan wouldn't hurt either. <br>  <br>  It's not my personal taste, but that's how it goes. <br>  <br>  It's still a game of pimps and hustlers. <br>  <br>  And they will nitpick every curve that's out of place - so investing in a trainer with a background in bodybuilding and nutrition with modeling experience and an understanding of where you want to go would help you out quite a bit. If an eventual transition to pro commercial is a goal. <br>  <br>  Otherwise starting out ... take what you can get and learn the business as you go along.<br>  <br>  ** and one more thing, take some related classes (such as from the arts (such as photography/video/voice/acting/dance) to business and contract law). It doesn't hurt. And it's one more ho factor for marketing yourself, cutting costs and learning the trade. Don't leave everything in somebody else's hands. Though a few people here might be dreaming of it.|`|ssV4NDUVaa	Well. You can start in myspace. Look for certain individuals that looks like someone took it (professionally).

UmjJmYsjaa	I dont.<br>  <br>  its a mistake. take for example this passage that is in the KJ version.<br>  <br>  Acts 2:31 - "31He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption."<br>  <br>  Why is Jesus soul in Hell? or , Why was his soul in there in the first place? The word "hell" is not suppose to be in the bible. The proper Greek word that is found here is Hades, or Adns.<br>  <br>  The New King James version changes this word to Hades. <br>  Acts 2:31 [new KJ] he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.<br>  <br>  PUT THE OTHER TIMES HADES COMES OUT IT'S STILL LEFT HELL, EXCEPT FOR THIS VERSE. I call that biased and an interpolation of the SACRED holy scriptures.<br>  <br>  I asked a question similar to yours.

Light has dark, good has evil, hot has cold for example. I actually don't see how anyone could believe in heaven without believing that there could be an evil alternative.|`|te9y6MQkaa	I do not believe in the hell that has been promulgated by the church for centuries. I do believe that people create their own reality and that for some incarnators life is much less pleasant than the life of others - to the point where it may be considered hell. <br>  <br>  The doctrine of a literal "hell" was just to keep the non-thinking masses in line...and in fear.|`|wB3AbJyLaa	Jesus, in the book of Matthew, numerously mentions hell. As a Christian, I must follow Jesus' teachings. One thing I don't agree with most Christians nowadays: Hell isn't a torture chamber. I believe that the imagery of flames the Bible uses to describe hell is a figure of speech. Trying to take flames of hell literally results in nonsense. For example, hell is described as a place of utter darkness. How can that be? Flames would light things up. Here's a similar example: The Bible says that, at his return, Christ will come surrounded by flames and with a big sword coming out of his mouth. Will he be unable to speak because he's choking on a sword? Few people consider that to be a literal sword. Instead, the sword in that passage of the Scripture is an image that stands for the word of God. The flames stand for Christ coming judgment. Another example: In Hebrews 12:29, God is called a consuming fire. Yet nobody thinks God is a cosmic Bunsen burner. Using the flame imagery is a way of saying he's a God of judgment. The Bible also talks about hell being a place where worms constantly eat people's flesh. In Jesus' day, thousands of animals were sacrificed ever week in the Temple, and there was a sewage system for the blood and fat outside, where it gathered in a pool. There would have been worms and maggots constantly feeding on that waste. It must have been a very ugly, and smelly, place. When Jesus was teaching, he used this metaphor as a way of saying hell is worse than that disgusting place outside the city, a place all of his listeners would have known about.|`|y9m8Tb93aa	The idea of Hell makes perfect sense.

Where is the empirical evidence for Cleopatra??|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	LOTS of historical evidence.  Romans, Persians, Jewish records. Then their are all the surviving christian documents in addition to the bible. <br>  We've lost original Roman documents detailing his crucifixion,  BUT we DO have Emperor Julius's mention of these records when he talks about how to handle the followers of "Chrestus" -- greek version of "christ" <br>  <br>  We have both Roman and Persian historians commenting on how to deal with these followers of Christ. <br>  <br>  We have the Jewish historian, Josephus's account of Christ, his crucifixion.  Centuries later, it is likely that well meaning Christians interjected a few lines into Josephius's accounts and added some lines about Christ being a good man, but even accounting for slight alterations.. the jewish historian DID record that Jesus did in fact exist. <br>  <br>  When modern day scholars actually examine the historic records, they find much more evidence to support the existence of Jesus and the fact that his followers started the religion we call Christianity today,  THEN we have of a lot of ancient cultures.  <br>  <br>  I mean when it comes to ancient cultures,  Historians consider accounts written by people who lived 200-300 years AFTER the events to be authoritative.  Such is the case with a lot of what we know about Roman culture. <br>  <br>  We can EVEN see this today....often times we consider a biography about a famous person to be much more "true to life" if it is published decades AFTER the person died, then if it is written immediately afterwards. <br>  Think if someone wrote about the Bush administration NOW,  verses 10 years from now??  We'd probably think the one written NOW was rushed or politically motivated, but trust the person who wrote it 10 years later...right?<br>  <br>  Well the same is true about what we know about Christ. It wasn't written immediately but often times 70-100 years later.  <br>  Far enough away to be considered unbiased and true,  BUT not as far away as SOME records we have of Roman, Egyptian, and Persian culture. <br>  <br>  So most scholars who STUDY ancient documents... feel more confident about the events surrounding Jesus then we are about a lot of other stuff  on one questions.  -- Maybe that's not saying much...depends on your perspective.<br>  <br>  So as sure as we CAN be.. he DID exist.|`|AA11598520	It wouldn't be called "scientific evidence," but "historical evidence" and, yes, it exists.

It is not about empirical evidence.  It is about faith.  You either believe the Bible and its claims or you don't.  It is that simple.  It is not blind faith.  It is faith in the clear revelations of God in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Let me ask you, is there any empirical evidence that Buddha existed?  How about Mohammad?  How about Shakespeare?  How about George Washington?  How about DaVinci?  How about any historical figure?

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

Some people are miserable because they don't know how to trust God, and to give all of their problems to Him and let Him work them out. Or, they are under attack from the enemy and they don't know how to just give the fight to God (Jehovah Nissi- God our banner who reigns in victory) and let Him handle it.

uFyycbjiaa	"How do you balance observation of the Sabbath without getting into legalism?"<br>  <br>  I don't understand this part of the question. Are you implying that you want to observe something WITHOUT the laws? How is this possible? Torah is LAW.<br>  With regards to the rest, I can tell you what is and what isn't permitted on Shabbat, if you want an answer from a Jewish perspective.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Deuteronomy 33:4<br>  "Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob."<br>  <br>  To understand Torah and it's laws, this has to be the basis. Torah law, observance of Shabbat, observance of Kashrut [dietary laws], observance of the feasts, etc... Is an inheritance to the congregation of Jacob, that being Israel. Remember in Genesis, Jacob has the encounter with the "angel" and the name of Israel is given to him. Israel clearly represents the Jews, so to begin, I'd like to clarify, that the laws of Torah, were given to Jews, and non-Jews are in no way obligated to keep them. <br>  <br>  That being said, I'll give you the Jewish perspective on Shabbat. <br>  The "work" that the Torah speaks of in regards to Shabbat means "Constructive work". It is a creative action. So basically, the things prohibited on Shabbat are those things that "Create". For example within Judaism, we don't write on Shabbat. Even though, most people agree that lifting up a pencil and pressing it against paper doesn't mean work, it's a creative action, and that's what's not allowed on Shabbat. This makes sense, seeing as how during the 7 days of creation, G-d ceased to Create on the 7th day.<br>  So the answer to your question on reading, is Yes, you can read on Shabbat. In fact Shabbat, is a great time to learn Torah. <br>  The concept of "Creative forces" on Shabbat should manage to answer all the questions that you've asked. <br>  Don't want to go into too much detail with Regards to Shabbat and Judaism. If I recall correctly, there are 39 categories of work, which are prohibited within Judaism on Shabbat or on the Holy days. But I think my answer suffices your question for now.|`|a8ee6125a780f8b8ee3dc3bd20ed75c9aa	I agree with Paperback 100%|`|8I9uduIiaa	Excuse me - if you want to know about JEWISH RELIGIOUS LAW, do yourself a favour and ASK JEWS.<br>  <br>  Messianics, as you yourself acknowledge, are Christians. Evangelical Christians. They are LITERALLY not Jews, just as Hindus and Catholics are literally not Jews.<br>  <br>  Also, to clarify: if you are a practising Christian, you are violating the Torah. You can't have it both ways. The Torah ***forbids*** the worship of any human; it forbids placing any human on a par with G-d; it forbids stating that any human can become 'divine'.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: if you worship Jesus, you are violating Torah.<br>  <br>  Torah is binding on Jews. It is not binding on Christians any more than the Quran is binding on Christians. Please either be happy with your Christian faith and all the good it holds, OR convert to Judaism and honour Torah. You don't get to have both.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	If you're interested in observing a Jewish Shabbat, the answers would be as follows:<br>  <br>  1.  My friends and I play board games together on Friday nights to avoid the temptation of turning on the TV, and that should be okay.<br>  <br>  2.  If you're reading for pleasure, that's up to you.  For instance, if you want to read the Torah, nobody's going to stop you from that just because maybe you proofread manuals during the week.  Use your own judgment there.<br>  <br>  3.  Of course you can!  Why else would God have told us to be fruitful and multiply?  To ignore the little ones?<br>  <br>  4.  Among Jews, modest dress is encouraged at all times.  Even colors should not stand out garishly.<br>  <br>  5.  Shabbat is for not using electricity (do not light a fire on shabbat, a major mitzvah).  It's not the entertainment that's prohibited, it's the electricity and the fact that you haven't backed down off of man's creations to simply enjoy God's creations.<br>  <br>  Conservative Jews will tell you that if that's how you relax, though, so be it.<br>  <br>  Torah IS law, look at last week's parshah Mishpatim if you don't believe me.  You can't have one w/o the other. <br>  <br>  DISLCAIMER:  I'm Jewish, and I don't like Messianics calling themselves Jews instead of Christians, but I appreciate you wanting an honest answer, so I hope I have given you just that.<br>  <br>  Note that I don't believe someone can call themselves Torah observant if they believe in Christ.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	I do not believe in waiting to the Sabbath Day to practice my faith. I do it daily. I pray frequently each day and I make sincere effort to practice my Christian beliefs daily. As Jesus said, "God works everyday."

I've seen so many thoughts like this, where one attempts to skirt an issue, adhering to the letter, rather than the spirit of a law.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Just rest and be with your family!  Sure watch a movie, etc.  (I would be with The Lord first before the movie though.)  :)|`|mNyhRGowaa	No trolling either on the sabbath!|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Christians looking to take on Jewish practices is awkward because so many are quite disrespectful to Judaism in the way they go about it. The 'Messianics' are particularly problematic in that. They may claim to be 'Torah-observant', but they're prone to significantly misreading Torah, refuse to acknowledge the important Oral Tradition, and perpetually violate one of Torah's central tenants, that G-d is unitary and without form.<br>  <br>  So they're not the best source of information.<br>  <br>  The Jewish prohibitions on 'work' specifically refer to the 37 (I think) types of work that went into building the Mishkon. You can find the list on the net. But since you're Christian, you're not bound by the Jewish covenant and you're free to do as you wish.<br>  <br>  Watching a movie involves electricity (spark = fire), which is prohibited. Non-electric forms of entertainment are fine, especially if they nurture your family's relationships with each other. So absolutely, play with your children (and chess with your wife). Reading is an important part of Shabbat for many Jews, and fortunately they managed to build the Mishkon without it ;-), but if you need space away from it, that's your prerogative.<br>  <br>  Getting dressed isn't building-the-Mishkon work, so don't fret about that. Don't use any electrical appliances though, like an iron.<br>  <br>  The balance between keeping Shabbat and 'legalism' is primarily a matter of attitude. If you find that difficult to understand, then it's probably best that you limit the Shabbats practices you undertake, or ease them in slowly.
y7HD8unTaa	I don't see  how us hippies screwed up the clothing market...unless you are referring to those imports from India that we loved to wear!<br>  Maybe we did wear them & yes, we purchased them...but who brought them into this country to begin with?   The America corporate greed mongers or the Europeans?... who were making a hefty profit to fund their personal vacations to who knows where!  <br>  <br>  The clothing these days have little to no staying power if washed in a machine.  Hand-washing is what prolongs a garment for years beyond it's intended time-span.  Most people want convenience & use washing machines & dryers which weaken the fabrics & since the seams are not finished very well...the garment literally comes apart at the seams & it's a waste of money in my opinion.  Since most of us can't afford better clothing...we are dealing with wasting money on substandard clothing or shopping at thrift shops for better clothing that is not in fashion.  The fine art of tailoring is almost gone because no one wants to work that hard in the one-of-a-kind industry....and very few people enjoy being told what to wear & how to wear it as they once did.  Vintage Designers who furnish *OTR have had to do so to survive & keep their name alive.<br>  <br>  I feel it's the Hollywood Studios who wrecked the used clothing markets when they send out their own people to buy up all things vintage in order to have a supply of ready costumes for their actors as they make movies about the eras of the past & could not afford to have to pay for all the costumes to be custom make for huge productions.  So many warehouses have so much clothing that they don't even bother to hang them up.  <br>  <br>  China, India, Vietnam, Pakistan, & Mexico seems to be remaking the oldies for all of us old hippies again!<br>  <br>  I just bought a peasant top for $15 at Wal-Mart.  It was all cotton.  Made in India.  The flowers were machine stitched.  The cotton WAS much thinner...but I liked that!  That same shirt would have cost me the same in 1970 & I would have had to stitch my own flowers on it.  It also would not have come in a large size for big women...but then I wouldn't have needed it in those days!<br>  <br>  I feel the prices for clothing are cheaper today.  It's the shoes that are costing more & more & more!|`|F68oo4Uzaa	They may have dressed better but in my opinion they cost less. But you have to compare garment to garment.

I ain't never heard so much chatter from folks who apparently ain't never really looked up and down on a lady. I've  been out of Texas several times and I did take a look at some of the ladies cause my Sweetie told me before I left "You can look but don't  put your hands " . I went up to Oklahoma and all I saw up there were Buffalo Girls and their feet covered up the whole sidewalk. I went over to Louisiana and those ladies over there were so skinny that you had to look at them from the front cause if they turned sideways you almost couldn't see e'm. Those ladies over in New Mexico were so ugly they had to sneak up on a glass to get a drink of water. It sure was nice gettin back to Texas. We had a really fine looking lady living up in the Red River Valley in Texas but she left.  I sure do miss her bright eyes and sweet smile. I felt as if she was taking the sunshine when she left. Also I personally knew The San Antonio Rose and Bob Wills and I both, deep in our hearts, remember a melody when we go to Old San Antone and it is that melody that the San Antone Rose sang to us while we enjoyed our tequila and her singing. I also remember a young lady down on Galveston beach wearing a yellow polka-dotted bikini. I guarantee you though, there ain't no place like home.

8G42oyydaa	Wait until you get married and your wife gets pregnant, believe me you will change your opinion on hormones and when your kids hit puberty, it will be another eye opener, and then there is menopause to look forwards to LOL Trust me hormones are chemicals raging through your brain and they can cause one helluva lot of trouble depending on whether they are on overload or out of balance or on the decline -<br>  <br>  No matter which way you look at it, we are all biological creatures, and hormones play a huge role, in physical, mental and emotional health.   Having said that we do still have free will and choice as to whether we allow ourselves to be completely controlled by hormones or not. <br>  <br>  You have the Adrenal Gland, the Thyroid, the Pituitary Gland, the Ovaries, Endocrine glands, testes etc all producing hormones, and there are a lot of things that can go wrong. Some can be life threatening, such as a "Thyroid Storm".<br>  <br>  In a nutshell research strongly suggests the high levels of  Testosterone can and does cause increased sexual aggression in both men and women. Vasopressin  levels in males can also affect sexual aggression. <br>  <br>  In looking at testosterone, vasopressin, and dopamine, and in noticing the primary link between sex and aggression in men, it's important to remember that the patterns of their activity are not "learned behavior."

I do happen to get flashbacks when I read certain questions pertaining to sex.  I don't take hormones.  I enjoy being on edge...it puts a little zip in my step!  I often suspect that many women never had hormones to begin with, so the mentality didn't factor into the eqaution when they went to the alter & took the name of the first man who asked them to.  Living years as the "mrs" tends to allow women the luxury to point the fingers at others who actually made great use of their hormones & have those xrated memories to use if needed!|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Actually you probably can't separate hormones from mentality, because your hormones affect your emotions and therefore yoru mental state.<br>  <br>  So the right answer is "Both" or "They are the same thing".|`|fyrj50Braa	I would think it was both depending on what kind of xrated thoughts.|`|AA12045802	Both.|`|nCkPhvf5aa	I agree. Sexuality is shoved down our throats today and as a result it loses its authenticity and overall value. Of course hormones play a significant role, but I find that people exaggerate their sexuality to look edgy.|`|spHjE3Cmaa	I think it is their mentality. It's true your hormones can affect your state of mind, but they don't always control it.

Ranchero, Vaca, Vaquero, Muchacho. Ranch, cow,cowboy, boy.  Our ranching industry was patterned on operations/enterprises in  Mexico, operated by  Mexicans on  their Haciendas and Rancheros.   Ranchers, ranch foremen,wranglers,fence riders, cooks, and cowboys all worked to make a ranching enterprise profitable. Ranchers and their help are still known as cowboys. Cowboy is not a word that has gone out of use. .|`|YupMCYHlaa	Ranchers and cowboys are different things.  A rancher is someone who owns or runs a ranch, a large area of land where livestock is raised. A cowboy is someone who works with cows, or by extension, other livestock.<br>  <br>  The idea of cowboys as we know them today, with the hat and the chaps and the boots and the kerchief around his neck, comes from the cattle drives that brought herds of cows to market by walking them across the country.  This was actually a very short period, starting about at the end of the Civil War and ending when the railroads reached into the Southwest.  After that, cowboys only brought cows to the railhead.  The cowboy became an 'iconic figure' and everyone in the southern half of the US wanted to look like one.  In fact it was a very hard and poorly-paid job, and only a desperate person would want to work that had for such low pay.|`|f8812f78f1ba5e0fefd58a87005ce671aa	Because they chased cows around, or 'drove' them, or 'herded' them from one place to another.

Let's party it up then!|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  The Catholic church teaches that Hell is entirely real.  The primary punishment is the intense pain of being eternally separated from God.  There is no way to truly describe how awful that will be for anyone who rejects salvation.   To describe it as a lake of fire is reasonable,  but still not sufficient.<br>  <br>  I think it is necessary to realize how awful hell is in order to understand why it should be a central part of all people's beliefs.   It is sufficiently dreadful that it can not be ignored.  You say that it seems to have been described only a few times,  but the descriptions given of Hell make it clear that Hell is horrible.   Something so horrible ought to be taken into regular consideration.   Jesus is not expected to kidnap anyone and force them into Heaven.   If anyone persistently, defiantly, and fully rejects God's free offer of salvation,  God will give that person what he or she has asked for.  That is separation from God - for eternity.<br>  <br>  I think it is a mistake to hate Satan more than you love Jesus.   To do so could even be sinful.   It is not, however,  reasonable to ignore Satan and Hell.   The beauty of Christianity is available only to those who accept it.  It would be very thoughtless of Christians not to warn others about the risks of obstinately rejecting  the salvation of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  I think we all should focus primarily on our hopes and prayers that we will spend eternity in Heaven with God The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit.  I also think we should remember the only other Eternal option - Hell.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	I agree with some of it. Hades and the Lake of Fire are different in the Bible.

She was blatantly flirting with this other girl in front of me. Well, when I found the other girl, 10 years later via myspace, what she told me about my ex nearly floored me, and made me realize there was a very good reason why I couldn't or shouldn't find her. My ex and her moved away after college, and apparently my ex even with a college degree never worked. She eventually had some sort of breakdown and her father flew out to get her. She ended up being committed, and then escaped, no kidding. She left behind a list of people she had it in for, and they were all contacted.

The only thing that scared me a little was that I had a good amount of my identity wrapped up in my beliefs and when I realized I didn't have those beliefs anymore I had a few weeks of panic trying to think how I would explain this to others and how I would still be me without that one part of myself. <br>  <br>  In the end, that worry was for nothing because I found I had plenty of identity still laying around and it wasn't that hard to explain how my beliefs had changed.|`|ATsdSM7saa	If anything I felt relieved.

No people who actually uphold truth, morality and a higher path could do that.<br>  <br>  Once I got disillusioned with the believers the realisation that there was no god came slowly.  Since I found out slowly I had time to get used to the idea.  It was a case of understanding one by one all of the times that I thought god had been in my life it was just me.  Kind of the opposite of the cheesy 'footprints' poem - I realised that I had carried myself where I had succeeded or fallen down where I had relied on god.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wowzone.com/fprints.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowzone.com/fprints.htm</a>|`|wcOq60Hhaa	No, not scared...I think nervous might be a better description.

Realizing how very small and alone we are pushed me very rapidly to the idea that we are all we have:  relationships & people matter.  Take life by the horns and enjoy the heck out of it.

Or, perhaps, it doesn't exist at all, and there is only consciousness.|`|UiUSsfuYaa	Sure it's possible. When I was put under for surgery, I can recall having a sort-of dream. It was not like your typical dream, since I still felt like I had lost a chunk of time when I woke up. I think the anesthesia causes some sort of short-term amnesia.|`|q2cRdOV6aa	Its not silly :)  No, just like when we naturally fall asleep each night, our soul is still alive and inside of us, when we are under anesthesia, our souls are still "awake".|`|AA12194228	Interesting question.<br>  I hadn't thought about that.

Don't be surprised if she says nothing but tell her that you are there for her when she wants to talk.|`|vTvsgVJiaa	I know what she did is rude, there's no denying that.  But do you know why she suddenly moved away?  Was she in an abusive relationship that she had to get away from instantly?  Or maybe she just lost her job and she can't afford dinner with you and is embarrased to tell you that.  There could be a million reasons, and to me it sounds like all she needs is  a good friend that will listen.  Take the high road, call her and ask what's up.  Of course you can always tell her you were quite disappointed that she blew you off too, but find out the reason before you judge her too harshly!|`|rThIVk2maa	Well you're right to feel hurt, she ditched you without saying goodbye. If your friendship means so little to her, then perhaps it is overdue to taper off or end. <br>  <br>  I've had this experience with some old family friends. My mother was completely distraught because they stopped speaking to us over a favor they had asked my mom to do them. She did the favor but didn't mail back a paper the exact same day, had simply waited until we saw them again. Because she didn't IMMEDIATELY rush the paper over to their house across town, they ended a 20 year friendship. It was harsh, but we can all see now that anybody so flaky and cold isn't a true friend and we are glad they are gone.|`|45azZvL9aa	Don't be.  Moving is so freaking stressful.  So hard.  Especially if it is a sudden thing.  <br>  <br>  She agreed to dinner, but you know, if it was a hard thing, hard move etc. she may have had it all packed up and was like "time to go and get on with it".<br>  <br>  Sometimes moving is just like starting over for people.  I'm sure she did not mean to hurt you.|`|O4jGlC2caa	It was rude.  It does sound like a midlife thing.  Well, if she calls again, tell her that she did have a tie here... but she just lost it.  Then hang up and go find a new friend.  Who does that to a friend of 10+ years?  Apparently you weren't as high on her friends list as you thought. :(|`|KdR1Lx3yaa	MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPEND AT HOME??

That was rude.|`|blxlNHeCaa	You may think she made a "flighty" decision, but maybe she really did to move home that soon. If she has been your friend for 10 years or more, then you need to be able to respect her decisions and realize that maybe she just needed to move back home for reasons she just couldn't tell you. <br>  <br>  <br>  You have a right to feel hurt or angry, and yes, it was quite rude of her to cancel on you so quickly, but she may have had a good reason.|`|swNHGx1baa	Well, if she has been your friend for over 10 years, then I'm sure she's not purposely trying to upset or avoid you.<br>  Moving is very stressful, and it was probably just not possible for her to make it to dinner.<br>  Ask her to meet up for dinner, maybe in a week or two, possibly longer. I would advise you to not get too upset about this one occasion, because you don't know what might have happened, or why she wanted to move at that time.|`|d2YvAtOjaa	Don't you think that for someone to move out of state without giving notice or being able to stay to say goodbye to friends has some MAJOR and very urgent reasons for moving. <br>  <br>  how do you know that a family member wasn't termianlly ill back home or she was being threatened or felt unsafe living where she was. <br>  <br>  I thin kyou should contact her, find out what went on and offer to go and see her. If you really are her friend you should be looking out for her.|`|4Vswcoqeaa	Yeah, you're better to let her call you first.  I guess she really needed to break away from everything.  Don't take it personally.  Chances are, however, moving somewhere else isn't going to cure her.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Give your friend of 10 yrs the benefit of the doubt  you said that rudeness is beyond anything you've seen from her so then this is out of character for her give her a little time then I'd call & see how she is My girlfriend never gave up on me about 3yrs ago I went through a rough patch in my life  & didn't keep in touch w/her but she wrote to me saying I'm here for you whenever you're ready This meant the world to me we've been best friends for 12 yrs & we've always stuck things out together good & bad times to me this is what a good friend does loves you & gives you a kick in the a** when you need it|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Ok... I know you're hurt and you have a right to that. They are your feelings and what she did was super rude however look at it this way...<br>  <br>  Is a sudden move (in the time you've known her of ten years, which is long enough to know someone to know who they are... if you are friends) in her character? Is she the rash decision type? How was she as a friend? Was she there when you needed her? Did she seem supportive of your goals? <br>  <br>  Have things been going on in her life that seemed mentally damaging or that have seemed difficult for her to handle? Has she been acting strangely and telling you that she feels like a new person? People JUST do things out of the blue. There is ALWAYS A REASON!<br>  <br>  Maybe she is in dire straits of some sort right now. Maybe something happened that she couldn't let you in on. Obviously her mind was on other things that were more vital than sitting there having dinner with you. Maybe she thought you'd ask too many questions or maybe she just couldn't handle saying goodbye... <br>  <br>  All I am saying is that it's your decision to call her or not, but if you do and if you reach her or her voicemail lend the support a friend of ten years would lend. Don't let your feelings get in the way of her being thoughtless once in a ten year friendship.

0lnamekJaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s...</a><br>  In Greek mythology, ''Pandora's box'' is the large jar (πιθο? pithos) carried by Pandora (Πανδ?ρα) that contained evils to be unleashed on mankind — ills, toils and sickness — and finally hope. [1]<br>  <br>  Etymology of "box"<br>  The original Greek word used was pithos which is a large jar which could be as large as an adult human. It was used for storage of wine or provisions, for example, or for funerary purposes as a human's grave.[2][3] In the case of Pandora, this jar may have been made of clay for use as storage as in the usual sense, or, instead, of bronze metal as an unbreakable prison.[4]<br>  <br>  The mistranslation of pithos as "box" is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam when he translated Hesiod's tale of Pandora into Latin. Hesiod's pithos refers to a storage jar for oil or grain. Erasmus, however, translated pithos into the Latin word pyxis, meaning "box".[5] The phrase "Pandora's box" has endured ever since. This misconception was further backed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti's painting Pandora.[6]<br>  <br>  Opening of the "box"<br>  After Prometheus' theft of the secret of fire, Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create the woman Pandora as part of the punishment for mankind. Pandora was given many seductive gifts from Aphrodite, Hermes, Hera, Charites, and Horae (according to Works and Days). For fear of additional reprisals, Prometheus warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus, but Epimetheus did not listen, and married Pandora. Pandora had been given a large jar and instruction by Zeus to keep it closed, but she had also been given the gift of curiosity, and ultimately opened it. When she opened it, all of the evils, ills, diseases, and burdensome labor that mankind had not known previously, escaped from the jar, but it is said, that at the very bottom of her box, there lay hope.[7]<br>  <br>  There is no reason to think Pandora acted out of malice in opening the jar, for she was exercising her curiosity, and also when she saw what was let out of it, she quickly closed it.[8].<br>  <br>  Feminist interpretations of Pandora's "box"<br>  Following Jane Ellen Harrison,[9] in an earlier set of myths, Pandora was a manifestation of the Great Goddess (provider of the gifts that made life and culture possible) and Hesiod's tale can be seen as part of a propaganda campaign to demote her from her previously revered status. The Hesiodic myth's misogyny is apparent in the transformation from a goddess to a man who gives all good things to mankind into a mortal woman created as a punishment who introduces all evils to mankind.[10][11][12] Modern feminist literary criticism has also focused on the gendered symbolism inherent in the myth. Pandora's jar, according to this school of thought, represents the female womb. That the jar releases a myriad evils upon the earth suggests the topocentric culture's unease with friendly female sexuality.[13]<br>  <br>  <br>  References<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box#References" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s...</a><br>  <br>  Bibliography<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box#Bibliography" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s...</a><br>  <br>  Pandora's Box<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/una_sorella/stories/pandora.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/una_sorella/sto...</a><br>  <br>  Fast Facts on: Pandora<br>  <a href="http://gogreece.about.com/od/mythology/a/mythopandora.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gogreece.about.com/od/mythology/a...</a><br>  Basic Story: Zeus, upset with the brothers Prometheus and Epimetheus for having successfully brought fire to humankind, making for all those annoying sparkling lights on the ground at night, decides to even things up by introducing disease, death, and sorrow to humankind. In the original tale these things are held in a jar, not a box. He orders Pandora to be created and gives her as a gift to Epimetheus, brother of Prometheus. She is told to never open her jar, but the gods and goddesses have also made her curious. Eventually, she opens the jar, which in some versions was not given to her by Zeus, but was instead kept locked up by Epimetheus,who did not want humankind to suffer. But in either case, the vessel is opened. Pandora realizes what she has done, but cannot slam the lid back on fast enough. The only thing left in the jar is Elpis, or Hope.<br>  <br>  There are several variants to Pandora's tale, more than the usual for Greek myths. In one, Zeus actually sends her with great gifts for mankind rather than evils. In most tales, she is also considered to be the "First Woman", brought into a world inhabited only by gods, goddesses, and human males. In this aspect, as an original woman bringing trouble into the world, her story is similar to that of Eve.<br>  <br>  Alternate name: In one early image she is called "Anesidora", the sender of gifts.<br>  <br>  Interesting Fact: Pandora's name means the "one who gives all gifts" and actually has a positive connotation. In earliest times, she may have been perceived as a bountiful earth goddess whose gifts were all good.
m3YC7Jcyaa	5.5 billion anyone saying anything even off that is a total moron.<br>  <br>  Jesus nor Moses ever confirmed them or wrote them down. No one around them wrote anything down.

The difference is that christians try to effect other peoples lifes in a good way athiest on the other hand have a way of attacking that ie Your question.

If that was the case everyone in the world would be in hell.<br>  As long as you carry yourself in a respectable manner then dont worry.<br>  <br>  And if someone does something you dont agree with doesnt mean you will go to hell ..Its when you do something that gods doesnt agree with and you dont repent is when that might happen eg.. having abortion, murdering someone, lieing and setting out to hurt someone.<br>  <br>  But god is a loving understanding one he will not put a Good person in hell .<br>  <br>  Religion is not ridiculous its sets morals and fibers within everyone (even you) it helps people eith there lives and its a fact that a person who has god in their life are alot happier than the people that dont.<br>  <br>  Scientists cant even figure out why that staue of our lady in lourdes is weeping..Heres the funny part though not only is she weeping but she is weeping an oil that does not exsist on this planet and it has converted hundreds of scientists.<br>  <br>  look around , Check out mejgorie and then come back and I bet you will be a change person.|`|5urfAbazaa	it's contradictory.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Its not just stupid, its much more devious than that.<br>  <br>  Religion is not something anyone is reasoned into, its a trauma inflicted on children by abusive parents.

I agree with a lot of what he says...but I do find it odd, that the reasons I dont beleive are completely different from why he does not believe.<br>  My big thing is that after studying and reasearching and actually trying to figure out how the bible came about, I came to the conclusion that there is very little chance that the bible is accurate....and 99.99999% sure that no being talked down or inspired anyone to write the bible (or more so all the individual works that put together make up the bible). The political and corrupt powers that had their hands in putting the bible together also make me doubt its authenticities. And the fact is, without the bible, then it is a fair certainty that people today would not believe what they believe...so that in and of itself leads me to dismiss the whole notion.
I3rjYVUFaa	Jesus/God only knows....<br>  <br>  But I will be happy to give you my best exegetical guess:<br>  <br>  You have correctly pointed out the references in Matthew 14 that tell us of John's death...<br>  <br>  There isn't space here, and it isn't necessary to post ALL of it, but if you READ the book of Matthew beginning with the DEATH of John the Baptist, and continuing to the DEATH of Jesus...<br>  <br>  Mat 16:21  From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. <br>  <br>  Mat 20:18  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, <br>  <br>  Mat 26:4  And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. <br>  <br>  I believe it was only a few months; the word passover nor season occcurs in Matthew BETWEEN the beheading of John the Baptist and the betrayal and death of Christ.<br>  <br>  The logical conclusion is that John's work was done.<br>  <br>  Edit: God has a sense of humor!! Can you imagine people thinking the lack of a head COULD prevent Jesus from resurrecting someone? This is the same God to whom the sea will give up her dead!!<br>  <br>  Rev 20:13  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. <br>  <br>  Which is easier, to resurrect Lazarus with his head on, or to resurrect those who are in the sea?<br>  <br>  Did you know that God shall laugh at them?<br>  <br>  Psa 2:4  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.|`|jdRKZe18aa	All the souls who have died will be resurrected beginning at the second coming of Christ - with few exception, none but Christ has been resurrected thus far......  The resurrection will come and the final judgment will follow.... it all has YET to occur.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind there is a huge difference between raising someone from the dead, which Christ had done or would yet do,  miraculously  - and being resurrected.  These are two completely different things.  A person who is raised from the dead is returned in normal mortal form to his earthly life.  A resurrected person has DIED, his spirit gone to paradise and is resurrected to immortality or eternal life.  The two are not the same or inter-changeable....just to be clear.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Miracles back in that time were reserved to "show" that Jesus forgave all sins and was merciful.  Jesus came with love and to teach us how to act and receive salvation.  My guess is because John the Baptist was the messenger of Christ, he already knew of the gift of salvation.  Christ would of had nothing to prove by resurrecting him as John would of already been in heaven. (my theory)  edit* actually to the person way above me, the dead did indeed rise, Jesus was certainly not the first or last to rise.  Remember the dead rose after the crucifixion of Christ, also Jesus rose Lazarus and others from death, and many today in the Holy name of Christ rise from the dead.|`|VncSMLMpaa	It is a reasonable question. I believe the only reason that Jesus' friend Lazarus was raised was to prove to those who were sympathetic to the gospel of the kingdom that Jesus did indeed have power from his Father to do all things. If we see what lazarus' sister says to Jesus, she believe in the resurrection.<br>  <br>  John the Baptist had done what he had been sent to do which was to prepare the way for Jesus, he had been totally faithful in these things and had baptised Jesus. The shock of what had happened to him would probably have reverberated around and people would have wondered about it and seen the corruption of the Roman system.<br>  <br>  John awaits resurrection when Jesus returns, he has proved himself worthy of it.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	not intended as a nasty comment: it's the same reason god doesn't heal amputees...  apparently once the part comes off, it's off|`|FBrwlhPtaa	The same reason he didn't resurrect his stepfather, Joseph.

Then all those whom God remembers will be resurrected from death.  Acts 24:15 shows both resurrection of righteous and unrighteous.  More specifically, those not declared righteous.  Willfully wicked would not be included.<br>  <br>  Jesus himself said at Matthew 11:11 how the least one going to heaven was greater than John.  This would mean his place on the cleansed earth is assured. Eternal life on a paradise earth in perfect health is a good reward for John the Baptist.|`|AA11703455	The reason Jesus left the area was that Herod was still dangerous, and we see that later Herod thought that Jesus maybe was John come back to life. Why? Because Jesus' teachings condemned his lifestyle as much as John did. <br>  <br>  Besides, the account that his disciples claimed John's body, maybe the lovely wife of Herod kept the head. Something like the cartels do with ones they execute down in Mexico. <br>  <br>  John will be back in the general resurrection (with head attached).|`|3DjUX8etaa	Jesus stated many times that all his power came from his Father. So it would to have been God that resurrected him, not Jesus. But, to give you a biblical reason why he wasn't resurrected, it is because that would have caused some to worship him. That would have been contradictory to God's plan.  God Bless!  +?+|`|jBYxEX8taa	I believe John had done his part for God. There was no reason to have him resurrected. God has a plan, and that was part of it. I think, in my opinion, that John is in heaven now with Christ. <br>  <br>  Death isn't always the worse thing. It's how you look at it.|`|oVHFz52Laa	It was not John the Baptist's job to continue his work here anymore. He is with God now.<br>  <br>  Jesus does not want us to look into our own circustances but to see that His work is done around us. He is winning even though it is not always looking like it|`|IkykHm7Jaa	Honest answer.<br>  Only Jesus knows.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	His work was done. He was to prepare people for the coming of the Christ and Jesus had come.|`|3i1vAIBFaa	It was his time to be with the Lord.|`|qJdWKcSQaa	The same reason he didn't resurrect everyone else|`|N6cCc9dOaa	Jesus did not resurrect him because nobody begged Him to do so and there was no need for it.And it was Johns time to go.|`|eIQ5T2amaa	Jesus could have raised John the Baptist, but did not. He only used performed miracles when they would be of some spiritual value. He did not heal the blind so that they could see, but so that they and others would believe in Him. He did not raise Lazarus because he was his friend, but because it would prove to Mary and Martha (important witnesses to his later resurrection) that He was God's Son. So, the answer is that raising John the Baptist would have not done enough good for the kingdom. A good question, though. It seems like John's resurrection would have been important enough. Then again, if Jesus had raised every important person that died, He would have had to raise many, many people. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S. I appreciate the honest question. Many people put such questions here as a challenge to Christians. This is not right or fair, and these people will not listen to reason anyway. Thanks.|`|lU285qgSaa	lol   Oh Gosh kinetochore... I could not help myself ... You are right though the head went in a different direction ... The Apostles buried the Body... But all serious now.<br>  <br>  Christ worked his Miracles as a way of showing people who he was. Many times he was asked to perform miracles and even at the end upon Christs' resurrection did Thomas Doubt and was told to put his hand in Christs side wound.<br>  <br>  With his cousin John the Baptist the work was done and there was nothing left to prove. John had followed his faith to the death. Had he risen to life his faith would have meant nothing in peoples eyes (sort of like saying Do what you want I cannot die so I will have faith in my God . Who would think twice about a faith such as that?)<br>  <br>  Johns Purpose was such : <br>  <br>  Luke 1: 11Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 12When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. 13But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. 14He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, 15for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.[a] 16Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. 17And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

We both stole the land from the Natives by conquest, extermination and assimilation. We had the longest undefended border in the world, until recently. We can drive for miles in each other's country without any obvious signs that we are in a foreign country, until we come upon a Tim Horton's Donuts store, an Arco service station, or a national flag. <br>  <br>  Different : Canadians have been described as "Americans without guns but with universal health care." <br>  On gun control, it has been suggested that many Americans value freedom over social stability. Many Canadians value the reverse. Canadians view universal access to health care as a moral issue for which they are willing to pay additional taxes in order to make certain that nobody goes without health care because they are too poor to pay for it. Many Americans would probably agree, but that country still lacks a universal health care system.

I wouldn't consider any of those harmful or disrespectful to the body.|`|RiyzkMO7aa	If these kinds of things were around at that time, I have no doubt that it would be listed as a sin. <br>  <br>  You have to understand, the bible was written by men who wanted a grip and influence on society and writing the bible and claiming it as the word of God was the perfect way to do it for them.

Jewish law forbids tattoos and ritual cuttings.  While Christians are not against the things you mention they are not exactly in favor of them either.  Perhaps one could argue that one cannot mark themselves if it is for a belief system that is apposed to Christianity.

WalnRzfGaa	1. I respect peoples beliefs as long as they respect mine, that does not mean that i don't find them all as silly as the easter bunny.<br>  <br>  2. i would probably be Buddhist, they talk about human ability and power and not God/Gods.<br>  <br>  3. i have fell in love with a catholic Girl and i plan to marry her. she respects my beliefs and i respects hers.<br>  <br>  4.IF this was the case i would not regret a thing i did. he did not give me the ability to believe in him. if the bible is right then he would not have been worthy of my worship anyhow because it would mean that this existence is just a game too him. he could not be a truly loving God if he made me knowing i would not believe in him and then send me to hell.<br>  <br>  5. i heard that dane cook joke as well, but he was not in a store but on a subway. i say Kazoontite or however its spelled.|`|8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	1) I respect people's right to hold beliefs.  The respect the belief itself is due is something else entirely, depending on the evidence supporting it.<br>  <br>  2) I'd have another try at Buddhism, but I've repeatedly failed at meditation.  No deity required.<br>  <br>  3) A dedicated Christian would be unlikely to find my beliefs acceptable in a partner, if they are following the bible. <br>  <br>  4) No.  I've gone with the best information, evidence,I've been able to discover, after considerable time and effort.  Which made me an atheist after many years as a Christian.  What else can one do?<br>  <br>  5) "God Bless you" to a sneeze is often mere social reflex, and not objectionable.  "I will pray for you" may be countered with "Thank you: and I will cast a spell for you" so the Christian can see how it feels with the situation reversed.|`|AA11297267	1. I don't "respect"  ANY beliefs.  I respect and would strongly defend your right to hold any belief you want...but the belief itself?  If it's patently ridiculous, then it's patently ridiculous and I'll happily say so and point out why.  Ideas and beliefs only get respect if they deserve respect, and have earned it by demonstrating through evidence that they're valuable ideas or beliefs.<br>  <br>  2. I wouldn't.  You can't force me to pick a religion.  If that means killing me, fine -- I'd rather have you kill me than pick a religion.<br>  <br>  3. I married a catholic.  Been happily married 15 years, with 2 wonderful kids.  I've never criticized her faith or tried to take her away from it...but after 15 years with me, she pretty much thinks it's all nonsense and has left it all behind.  Facts are powerful things.<br>  <br>  4. No, I wouldn't regret studying, evaluating evidence, being honest about what is and isn't true, and living a good life.  If some god wants to condemn me to hell for being a smart, honest, good person...then that's not any god I'd ever have any respect or worship for.<br>  <br>  5.  "god bless you" when somebody sneezes is not considered a religious phrase, it's considered a polite phrase.  I just smile and say thank you.  I'm an atheist, not a jerk.<br>  <br>  I've got a suggestion for you:  instead of just sticking with what you were taught, go out and find your own answers.

I accept and respect them, as long as they reflected the same behavior.<br>  <br>  2. That's a hard decision, I'd probably come up with my own religion.<br>  <br>  3. I would, but this question is irrelevant because I've fallen in love with a fellow atheist. I didn't choose to date him for what he believes either, it was something I found out after we had been together for a while. I wouldn't love him any less if he changed his mind though.<br>  <br>  4. No because if there is a god then he created me able to question his existence. How could he sent me to hell for a flaw that he made? I would simply apologize then commit.<br>  <br>  5. No because I don't walk around wearing a shirt that says "Hello, I am an atheist" so I don't expect people to know unless I tell them. I also understand that when people use that statement isn't to be offensive but to be kind. I don't trip over little things like that.|`|F5lCFvqeaa	1.  As long as someone doesn't try to force their beliefs unto our laws (proposition  8) or doesn't do anything that imposes their will upon others (child marriage),  I don't care if he/she doesn't share my atheism.<br>  <br>  2.  I'd probably go back to Catholicism, just because they're less pushy than other Christians (in my experience), and because I feel closer to them.<br>  <br>  3.  As long as she was not prejudiced (homophobia, for example) or was not an extremist of any kind,  I wouldn't care what beliefs she would have (as long as she's not a neo-conservative, LOL).<br>  <br>  4. If I died and there was a god, what would I have to regret?  I'm an atheist because I can't make myself believe in a god.  If I went through the motions (and tried to act like a Christian), I'd just be lying to myself.  Why would a god reward deceit?<br>  <br>  5.  I've seen very little of Dane Cook, and I don't want to see anymore.  He's not very good, regardless of his spiritual position.|`|K1bKPZ3Waa	1) I firmly believe it is everyone's right to belive or disbelive in any religion they see fit, all though it is as silly as the easter bunny, I have no problem its not my business.<br>  <br>  2) I would never pick a religion each are as equally foolish but have the same amount of good morality preaching the right methods to life on some level.<br>  <br>  3) I would marry anyone of any religion in theory but I would be disgruntled if they were very devout and practised frequently. <br>  <br>  4) This is an interesting thought. The odds are insansley slim, I would think I would just as soon get into heaven for the life I lead and the things I did to other people and treated them properly. Secondly I think God (totally hypothetical) would relate to me saying, that he couldn't blame me for not beliveing in him what with all the ludacris stories that are portrayed in religion.<br>  <br>  5) No I take it as a compliment.<br>  <br>  P.S.

However, what's most disturbing about your post is that you think DANE COOK is funny. I think I'm more apt to say GOD is real as opposed to DANE COOK is funny.<br>  <br>  The key point is what you have been TAUGHT. You have been taught from a young age.

I accept other peoples belief, we can all choose what we want to believe in.<br>  <br>  2. I would probably be a taoist or any of the eastern religion such as buddhism, and hinduism because they're more peaceful, and don't wage wars and they don't use their religion to influence politics. <br>  <br>  3. I suppose I might be okay with marrying a Christian as long as they don't use it on me, but I already have an atheist boyfriend whom I love. <br>  <br>  4. Nope I won't regret it, I'd rather have lived the life I wanted to live. Besides, maybe Hell is fun. <br>  <br>  5. It doesn't bother me at all.|`|12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	1.  I hold beliefs that are not typical for an atheist (angels, souls, etc). I appreciate people  being respectful of what I believe, and I extend the same courtesy to others.<br>  <br>  2.  I've never really thought about this. I suppose I could say that I followed any religion, and still retain what I believe. Unlike Christianity, I would not be renouncing anything to feign belief in any God or gods. Following? If you asked this of a Christian, they would have to deny Christ. I am in a position to say anything and deny nothing.<br>  <br>  3.  I *am* in love with a Christian. An Evangelical Christian. <br>  <br>  4.  Yes, I suppose that I probably would. We crack jokes about Hell, but I seriously doubt that any of us wants to go there.<br>  <br>  Added: I should have been more clear ... As the others are saying, you cannot force yourself to believe what you do not hold to be true.  My regrets would be for the jokes I have cracked, and other examples of *snarkiness.*  It would be my hope that any supreme deity might forgive my disbelief, and judge me by my deeds. I would regret my disrespect.<br>  <br>  5.  Honey, when someone sneezes near me, I immediately respond with, "Bless you!" Some habits die hard.

3OZgcntfaa	I don't imagine it's "hereditary" in the sense that one or both biological parents behavior created the genes for a child to be trans. Being trans is a lot like being intersexed. The only difference is, doctors cannot see the disconnect between body and mind at birth.<br>  <br>  I would reassure the father it's not his fault, and there are much worse things in the world than being transgender. <br>  <br>  A common theory being investigated is that during pregnancy something interrupts hormonal development. The mind is given a gender imprint first, and after that has settled in, the body is told to develop. Popular theory says that some sort of stress occurs and the mother's body miscommunicates what sex characteristics are "meant" for the child.<br>  <br>  Really, it's a condition that isn't anyone's "fault". Nobody chooses to be trans and nobody makes you trans. You just are. It's just one more way of being human.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	Actually, because they are fairly sure than transsexuality has to do with the fetal development and various hormone things... it really could be hereditary. Which of course wouldn't mean that the parents would have to be trans to pass it on, just that something in their genes makes it more likely to occur. That could explain why quite a few transmen seem to have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and/or naturally higher testosterone levels.<br>  <br>  But that's transsexuality, which falls under the transgender banner but isn't the same as being 'plain old' transgender. ^^;<br>  <br>  I think being transgender, not transsexual, COULD be hereditary but also just might be the result of living in a household where... presumably... people are more open and less restrictive about gender and all that good stuff. Open-minded parents tend to produce open-minded children.|`|bRRNYsK8aa	ignore the first answer - talk about idiotic. :]<br>  <br>  personally, idt that sexuality is hereditary at all. i mean, if that were so, then how is it that one person in a whole family can be a lesbian, with the rest as straight as arrows.? it wouldn't make sense, imo. i've always seen it as, yes, a trait you're born with ... but, not a trait of generics, & more of your own person. <br>  <br>  you could say something like that about everything. i mean, even skills & work ethic traits. just because a girl has a mother who's hardworking doesn't necessarily mean that the girl wouldn't turn out to be lazy. why.? well, because those are mental traits ... they're not physical things, even if they can relate to physical outcomes & the like.<br>  <br>  how's this possible.? it's obv. just a coincidence. if it weren't, then a lot of other things surely wouldn't make sense. if a girl is adopted by a lesbian couple, does that mean that she too in turn will come out as homosexual as well in her later years.? of course not ... there's no direct connection. jsut because of how you're brought up ... though i could see why some would see a link there. however, pplz are always jumping to conclusions about coincidences ... i'm sure it's not generic or anything. why's it matter so much anywho.? :]|`|FGfaO2Ecaa	it could be hereditary. some ppl are born with it. it just takes them a while to realize it. but it could be environmental. i dont know the exact percentage but i think its more hereditary.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	This is actually something I know nothing about . . . I'll be looking forward to reading the answers.|`|65QqZBnjaa	The answer is we just don't know.  Very few studies have been on trans people period, never mind their family history.  I don't really think it makes much difference though because either you're trans or you're not and nothing is going to change that.
oE0JCu89aa	If you need to question it, then just don't put yourself in the situation.<br>  <br>  Say you would like to go out and eat, not because you don't trust him, but that you "want to get to know" him better.|`|FOtNl2Lxaa	too soon go out a little bit more cause if you do dinner chances are he's gonna want "dessert" lol|`|7Fc22teCaa	You have a worried tone, so bring some bear spray.lol|`|0DOZKXwRaa	I am not the best person to answer this, because I took risks when I was single. I went to a guy's party with noone I knew the second time I had ever seen him, and had him come over to assemble my bed the third. We have now been living together 2 years are are waiting for our first child, so it sometimes turns out right.<br>  <br>  Are you concerned because it is inappropriate to you or because you are scared? If you are scared of the situation or him, and you still want to go, you can ask him if he would mind making it a group thing, or a double date! <br>  If you think it would be inappropriate just the two of you, you could do that too. <br>  You could also suggest a different restaurant, but be prepared for him to be a bit disapointed. <br>  <br>  If you feel safe with the situation, go for it!|`|38e6be03a2ded6d233d80ef88f7561d1aa	I don't think there is anything wrong with it.  Typically you would eat out at a restaurant on a date before him cooking for you.  It is kind of nice that he's going to try cooking for you.  I wouldn't be concerned for your safety given that you met through mutual friends.  However, if you feel uncomfortable politely say you'd rather take him out to a place for dinner.  Given that you are college students maybe he is hoping to save money while at the same time trying to impress you by cooking for you?  Maybe if you suggest a restaurant, you could pick up the bill.  I am 28 and my current girlfriend loves when I cook something for her.  She appreciates the effort even if its something really simple.  So do what you feel comfortable, but I say if you make suggestions that are more expensive than what the guy had planned, you should pay. (it doesn't hurt to pay every 3 or 4 times at least anyway).  Just my thought from a guy's perspective.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	You have nothing to loose. Take the chance =]|`|2gstVBcMaa	Well...i met a guy almost 2 weeks ago.  We went out on 3 dates and then he suggested that i come over to his house for dinner (last friday night) He said he was making the offer and that if i fely comfortable with it then he would love to cook for me and if i was not comfortable with it then he would take me out to dinner.  So...i went to his place and had an AMAZING dinner and evening.  After dinner and a few glasses of wine we watched a movie and it was perfect!<br>  <br>  So my suggestion to you is to do a gut check and if you don't feel like its time to go to his place for dinner then don't go!  I mean you are the one that knows this guy and weather or not you are going to be comfortable in his personal domain.  But you are the only person that can really say weather or not you would be comfortable there.  Good Luck!
77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	It's probably because many LDS parents don't do a thorough job teaching their kids sex ed.  I had room mates in college who had an extremely elementary understanding of sex.  Sex happens in all groups, races, ages, religions, etc.  No one is denying that.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  It should also be noted that EVERY case of chlamydia is required, by law, to be reported to the health department.  The flu, chicken pox, etc do not have the same reporting requirements.  Furthermore, let's dig up the statistics on chlamydia per capita per state shall we?  I'm going to guess Utah is not that high on that list.<br>  <br>  See: <a href="http://www.avert.org/stdstatisticusa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avert.org/stdstatisticusa.htm</a>  Utah doesn't even make the top ten.  And further research will show you that Chlamydia is first in many states.  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats07/figures/3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats07/figures/3...</a>  Here's another one from the CDC that shows you that Utah is one of the LOWEST states in the nation.<br>  <br>  You can sensationalize all you want, that only reflects on you.<br>  <br>  <br>  And yes, there are reporting laws on the flu and chicken pox BUT first of all, there is a vaccine for flu and chicken pox so incident rates are directly lower due to those.  In fact, chicken pox is nearly eradicated so that's not even relevant.  Second of all, I had the flu this winter and didn't go to the doctor.  How many people do you think go to the doctor with the flu?  Third of all, the reporting laws are much STRICTER for STDs than for other communicable diseases.<br>  <br>  If you have a problem with the LDS church, state it head on instead of using sensationalism and poor reasoning to try to discredit it.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just in case you want more statistics (which you should have looked into before posting this) here: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus07.pdf#051" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus07.p...</a>  Chlamydia is the most prevalant communicale disease in the US.  Higher than the flu, higher than chicken pox.  This is not just a Utah problem.  The fact that Utah is in the bottom ten states for cases of chlamydia per 100,000 says volumes more than your initial assertation.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Update your info on the porn thing:<br>  <a href="http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=148&sid=5744801" rel="nofollow">http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=148&sid...</a><br>  <br>  The huge amount of college age kids and young people (by far the biggest population in the nation) contrasted with the fact that the usage stats are so close in multiple states makes the charge that Utah leads the nation in Porn a complete misnomer.<br>  <br>  The study was done with a political agenda, and Utah is the most conservative state in the nation, thus the desired outcome was what they reported yet when measured against young poeple in other states Utah would be in the middle of the road.<br>  <br>  By the way, reread the article youposted about STDs and view other areas, you'll find Utah less than average in STD transmissions.<br>  <br>  Your rant is wrong.|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	How does it feel to be a biased nit-picker and have the droppings fly back in the face?

What were his reasons for doubting these basic doctrines of some of Christendom’s religions? He wrote: “A God that would use his power to create human beings whom he foreknew and predestinated should be eternally tormented, could be neither wise, just nor loving. His standard would be lower than that of many men.”16 While still in his late teens, Russell started a weekly Bible study group with other young men. They began to analyze the Bible’s teachings on other subjects, such as immortality of the soul as well as Christ’s ransom sacrifice and his second coming.. In July?1879, Russell started to publish Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence, known worldwide today as The Watchtower—Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom. In 1881 he, in association with other dedicated Christians, established a nonprofit Bible society. From the very beginning, Russell insisted that there would be no collections taken at congregation meetings nor contributions solicited through the Watch Tower publications. 19 As a result of their Bible study, Russell and his associates came to reject Christendom’s teachings of a mysterious “Most Holy Trinity,” an inherently immortal human soul, and eternal torment in hellfire. They also rejected the need for a separate seminary-trained clergy class. They wanted to return to the humble origins of Christianity, with spiritually qualified elders to lead the congregations without thought of a salary or remuneration.—1?Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9.21 Russell knew that a great preaching work had to be done. He was conscious of the words of Jesus recorded by Matthew: “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matthew 24:14; Mark 13:10) He was a very humble man,he never wanted to be looked up to or called a prophet.All he wanted to do was to search the scriptures and preach the good news of God's Kingdom.(Matthew 6:10) Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.(Daniel 12:4) “And as for you, O Daniel, make secret the words and seal up the book, until the time of [the] end. Many will rove about, and the [true] knowledge will become abundant.”(Matthew 24:14) And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	All "prophets" are false.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  I am not an expert on Mr. Russell,  but I'm pretty sure he never actually claimed to have any special personal private revelation from God.    I'm not sure Charles Taze Russell was even a prophet.  He taught based on his understanding of scripture.   I think he was mistaken about much,  but that would make him a poor theologian or poor teacher - not a false prophet in the sense that the word "prophet" normally  is used.<br>  <br>  I hope that Charles Taze Russell finally accepted the truth before he died.   His teachings have led many people astray.  I pray for his eternal salvation.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	First, he was not a prophet.  So he could not be a false one.<br>  <br>  What he was:  a searcher for truth.  He understood what was being taught in the churches was not what the Bible teaches.  He and others  turned to look only to the Bible to decide what to believe.  Not to blindly accept the teachings of the clergy with no basis in the Bible.<br>  <br>  This was something not done for almost 1800 years!<br>  <br>  True it was difficult and they made errors.  Coming out of false religion, several of the false doctrines stuck to them and like mud, they had to be scraped off.  It took time.  But as they learned more, they made changes.<br>  <br>  They learned God and Jesus were not part of any trinity.  Man does not have an immortal soul.  There is no hellfire for the dead to be tortured.  Russell and those with him had to find this out for themselves.  Unlike us today who have books that point right to the verses which prove these things in an organized way.<br>  <br>  The big point is that they were willing to do what was needed to become in line with the Bible's teachings rather than hold on to pagan ones like other religions.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Yes.

9jo37B3saa	Assalamu Alaikum<br>  Thank you for asking a very good question.<br>  <br>  The answer is, No, it would not be the same. However, there is still a chance for great rewards with Allah and there are some things you can do as well, Insha' Allah. <br>  <br>  Reading from books in other languages is not the same as reading in Arabic. However, there is still reward for you, Insha' Allah.<br>  <br>  Difficulty in reciting the Arabic is rewarded double for the one who is not an Arab speaker. <br>  <br>  You can rise up early every morning before fajr and begin to recite a little at a time, step by step while you are learning. Make sure to continue this from now on, as this was definitely a part of the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.<br>  <br>  Take your time and be patient with yourself. It takes time, effort and practice to become a real reciter of Quran.<br>  <br>  There is a dua (supplication) in the Quran for gaining knowledge and we always suggest it to those who want to gain more knowledge. We have to understand all knowledge only comes from Allah.<br>  <br>  "Rabbi, ziddni 'ilma. Rabbi, ziddni 'ilma." (My Lord, increase my knowledge.

It is a mental condition and one that you should work on with a qualified therapist. Many people have race phobia's both ways and it is something I recommend working on for anyone who has a fear like this. There is a lot of life you will be missing out on because of your fear.<br>  <br>    Also by telling the person you don't like them, it will do no good for anyone. It will be offensive to the person you are telling and actually if you read your statement, it is not that you do not like them but that you are afraid of them. There is a difference. Being afraid of them has to do with you and when you say you don't like them, it places the fault on their shoulders. It is not their fault that you are afraid of them and it is not your fault.<br>  <br>    The main thing to do is know that even though this fear is not something you wanted, you have it and can decide to work on changing it. It will open up a lot of doors for you to be free and happy. I mean, just try going to Disneyland without meeting a white person. They are everywhere and you would be panicked the entire time you are there. Imagine a life where you can just enjoy being yourself wherever you are. It can be so freeing to face our fears and I hope that you decide to do that.<br>  <br>   So my answer to your question is that you do neither but that you work on your fears.|`|jJDN2Uhpaa	It's really a matter of them tolerating you...<br>  <br>  Be polite, amiable and friendly.

iH7ZB5Soaa	The vast majority of the Companions were at the highest level of human perfections. For at that time in the mighty revolution of Islam, good and truth appeared in all their beauty, and evil and falsehood, in all their ugliness, and they were felt physically. Such a difference was apparent between good and evil and such a distance opened up between truth and falsehood that they drew as distant from one another as belief is from unbelief, and even Hell is from Paradise. The Companions, who by nature possessed elevated emotions, were captivated by the highest morality, and inclined towards dignity and virtue, would not voluntarily stretch out their hands to evil and falsehood, and so fall to the level of Musaylima the Liar and his ridiculous utterances. For he was the herald of falsehood, evil, and lies, and their embodiment. Their characters demanded that they looked to the rank of the perfections, those of God’s Beloved (PBUH) at the highest of the high, who was the herald and embodiment of truthfulness, good, and right, and that they hastened in that way with all their strength and endeavour.<br>  Even senses like those of fancy and imagination, in an awakened and aware state, received the numerous meanings of those recitations and glorifications in accordance with their own perceptions, and absorbed them.<br>  Thus, due to this wisdom, when the Companions, whose senses were awakened and subtle faculties, alert, uttered those blessed words comprising the lights of belief and glorification, they did so in all their meaning and they partook of them with all their senses. However, after that revolution and upheaval, the subtle faculties have gradually sunk into sleep and the senses fallen from that point of realities into heedlessness; like fruits, under the veil of familiarity, those blessed words have gradually lost their delicacy and freshness. Simply, as though drying up through the air of superficiality, only a little freshness remains, and this may be restored to its former state only through drastic surgery of a reflective and reasoning kind. Thus, it is because of this that another can reach the virtue and level the Companions attained to in forty minutes, only in forty years.|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	He said he missed us because we are going to love him more than the Sahabi.. read it again for the first time.<br>  <br>  This sermon was delivered on the Ninth Day of Dhul Hijjah 10 A.H. in the 'Uranah valley of Mount Arafat' (in Mecca). <br>  After praising, and thanking Allah he said:<br>  "O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether after this year, I shall ever be amongst you again.

Ex4Lv68yaa	Animals are extremely sensitive and have heightened skills in the senses.  I believe they can sense and see spirits.  I had a cat once that acted strange and would look up at the corner of the ceiling a lot with huge eyes!  :)  It didn't happen very often but when it did she definitely was seeing something.  I got a kick out of it.  :)<br>  <br>  I have had experiences in this area ever since I was little.  People who haven't had this experience will not understand, no offense to any of them.|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	Who knows- very possibly as I think they have senses beyond our capability but I'd go for the burglar angle.  Maybe you should check out a Q coincidentally asked by Dogs(!!) M in Current Events - What would you do if someone broke into your house...?|`|n55igpCUaa	Apparently not...<br>  <br>  <-- Quoting... "But I'm always so vigilant! No one can evade my detection!

It's hilarious that people just jump to the explanation of "It was a spirit" Maybe your pets were listening to something crawling in the attic or maybe on the roof, after all they do have extra sensitive hearing!|`|f75f1f375524c86801b6480a227d61c4aa	Yes they can sense spirits. My brother came down to my house with his dog a few weeks ago and she was sitting on my lap, next thing her head started turning slowly like she was following something in to the kitchen, then she jumped off me and followed whatever it was in there. She was'nt growling or barking so that made me feel comfotable knowing that whatever it was, it was'nt bad.|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	i am under the impression they can,<br>  animals including cats really do, though with cats and cat owners itis a completely different experience...<br>  i think canines are special in they do protect there masters..... and yes i from personal experience can say that they can see Ghosts...<br>  <br>  how big that gets and how much they can see i dont know....|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	My opinion is that animals and possibly small children can sense things from a spiritual realm as well as an unseen natural realm (such as sensing approaching storms and tremors).|`|3d6119cf4a9df27c12f9843ac9018153aa	Yes. Sometimes they actually chase the ones that are joyriding.|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	Dogs and Cats can see spirits.|`|ULUpOqplaa	No but they are telepathic.  That has been proven.|`|Q4MqzxX7aa	Go ask over on the pet section. I hear the cats, dogs and fish over there give great answers.|`|1c76cd87771103aee19c4f7d36a36a65aa	Yes, they can, actually my dog has done this 2, one night i was watching t.v with the lights off, and he was laying in the corner all calm and suddenly he jumped up and ran to where i was, it was like if something had scared him, i was real scared cause my my parents were in the kitchen nowhere close to the dog<br>  <br>  but i believe they sense demons not ghosts|`|l2QUgSwzaa	YES they can, i dont know where you live but where i born there lots of dogs that belong to nobody and we dont see them in the day time only in the night and they scream all night long, i used to watch them from the window and they scream on nobody, plug in my believes that dogs can see ghost/Jinn|`|rmb2dwcNaa	yes they can. i saw it and also whit my own camera!<br>  the people said no did`nt  experience the same i have and a lott of other people to.<br>  so YES they can|`|EcQMQeyIaa	No. Dogs have a much greater range of hearing and sight than humans, so when they freak out it's probably because something they have picked up on something too subtle for us to determine.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	No, but they can lick themselves in ways we only wish we could.|`|NoTA4Tp5aa	I think does can see/sense ghosts.<br>  My great-nan died and a few weeks before my uncles wedding me and my mum were talking in the kitchen. All the doors and windows were shut and all of a sudden the picture of her fell of the shelf.<br>  later that night my dad thought he saw a lady go up the stairs. he went and looked and couldn't find anything.<br>  later that night will i was sleeping in bed.(our dog sleeps on my bed) I don't remember this as i never woke up but my mum and dad woke up my the sound of our dog barking really soundly. this is strange as my dog never barks. they came in my room thinking he was attacking me and found him sitting on the bed staring at a spot in the middle of the room, but nothing was there.|`|AA11058044	There is no evidence that dogs can sense "spirits", "ghosts" or anything that cannot be detected by human senses or equipment.<br>  <br>  There is evidence that dogs can often hear mundane things (electric motors, ultrasonic whines, distant vehicles or people talking) that humans cannot at the time, and much like some humans, they sometimes panic when they hear or sense something they don't understand and start barking.<br>  <br>  They are also pack animals, so if one dog gets a little freaked out and starts barking at something it thinks it hears, other dogs will follow suit and start barking and getting freaked out, even though they have absolutely no clue what the first dog is on about.<br>  <br>  Without further investigation it's impossible to speculate about what your dogs are barking at, but as anecdotal evidence I used to make my neighbour's dogs go absolutely freaking batsh*t insane with just a sherry glass in my kitchen.<br>  <br>  By wetting my finger and rubbing it around the rim of the sherry glass, I could get it to produce an incredibly irritating high pitched sound.  I used to do it to bug my Mom, but when I noticed the neighbour's dogs in the backyard going insane, I started doing it about once a week after I got home from school.  Yes, I am kind of a jerk.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, I found out later that the woman who lived next door was becoming convinced that there was some kind of spirit or poltergeist in her home because every so often, usually in the afternoon, all of her dogs would just suddenly go insane and start running around the house, growling, barking and even biting each other.  Then they would all suddenly stop at the same time.<br>  <br>  After I found out how freaked she was, I stopped doing it (I'm not that much of a jerk).  So there's no way she'd ever suspect that it was actually some jerky kid next door playing with a sherry glass.  I imagine if any "ghost hunters" or anything ever showed up, they'd be equally mystified.  But just because no one can think of a rational explanation, doesn't mean there isn't one (well, a sort of rational explanation anyhow).|`|EQdDkSw0aa	I'ts not a ghost...it's what some call the devil!<br>  <br>  How do you think people get possesed?

I don't buy that Trinity stuff you're going on about.<br>  <br>  I realised in mid-teenage that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  When I first had doubts about my faith - I was Catholic - I thought that maybe this was a test of my faith. So I made the effort to accept it even more so. But the doubts came again, and I wondered what would happen if we took faith out of the equation; the world and nature still made sense, so I saw no reason to get back into it. At the time this was difficult intellectually and emotionally (I was a teenager, after all).<br>  <br>  That was getting on for 40 years ago, and my escape from faith has freed me to embrace what science has to offer, which I consider far more plausible than belief in the supernatural, and is the nearest we can get to the truth about how nature and the universe work. I've felt a sense of freedom ever since.<br>  <br>  I still have an interest in religions, mythology and related matters, and am fascinated that people still believe in things that to me are just not true.|`|AA12360579	Actually, me and my dad have a really good relationship, so no.

1415133dda6d51b695452e406f5973a5aa	More importantly is the understanding of what is needed if they don't.<br>  <br>  Without a shared purpose (almost all religions and some pure ethnoracial cultural traditions force this, which is actually part of the reason they exsist) you end up with a relationship soley based on those frist feelings of attraction, which never last long and as time progress a deeper spiritual crisis will result, really a fundemental problem with purpose because attraction only serves a momentary purpose, unfornutly sex sells and so does the ideal of it's ability to be the sole purpose in peoples lives. <br>  <br>  So no a person sounldn't, not just for the sake of love, but for the sake of self-perservation.|`|LoftAKETaa	That would be a very selfish person if their only considering their own feelings. The feelings actually should be mutual between both individuals. Also that's where your respecting that person as well.
z2cysiEhaa	I've had a similar thing happen when close life long friends suddenly became "New Christians" I'd say it was a form of brain washing with them to the point of obsession. But eventually the "high" wears off and things begin to go back to normal again. Don't get involved in religious discussion or debate between them. It'll wear off eventually, or if not,just let it be, as the reality of life soon pulls people back down to earth again.|`|YLW7cEjkaa	Why do people always get to offended when faced with the idea of changing themselves? The only reason someone would not need change is if they were perfect, and no one can claim that they're perfect.  So if the Bible leads to an improvement in someone's life or behavior, then I'd say we need more of it. If someone in your life is causing you to sin, I'd say you need less of them.|`|DhoFVv4laa	Your question is lame. But your story is interesting. Becoming a Christian is a big life change, just like joining the military or moving to a new city. You could replace Christian with any other change and it would play out the same way. To answer your question, Jesus hung out with the freaks, not the religious so I suppose if you were following Christ's example that Christian dude would hang out with his neighbor even more! <br>  <br>  All that aside, many times new Christians will split from their buddies for a while as they grow with God. Once their relationship is solid they tend to start hangin with their homies again.|`|413be7c04d333409be634127a4a62510aa	While it is true that Christians, in an ever evolving spiritual journey, should surround themselves with like-minded individuals, true Christianity does not advocate "kicking somebody to the curb," as someone else suggested. On the contrary, Christians are instructed to love others as themselves. People who are truly practicing the very basics of Christianity will strive be kind to everyone. <br>  <br>  That being said, someone may choose not to spend time with another person because they are uncomfortable with the activities or behavior involved. Again, though, that should be handled with kindness and honesty. Someone who really understands Jesus' teachings will not distance themselves from a person -- just from the person's behavior.|`|WZvH3aHwaa	Yes it actually is. It tells you what type of people you should associate with who are god-fearing people with godly morals, not the teachings of the world. Your neighbor's been getting his life together.|`|pfNnuD5saa	I used to be agnostic, I am now Christian. I didn't drop friends. Maybe there is more to the story?|`|bc46dad1b25f4cb2ef6fc328aa43d25baa	The friend has his/her own path to follow, if they are not willing to give others the time of day leave them to their beliefs..... not worth the hassle otherwise...............|`|5c6973113e114ed2747c54aecbdb1aa3aa	You can't really judge based on that because you don't know why his best friend decided to not be friends anymore.  Maybe he realized that this guy wasn't a good influence on him and he needed to be surrounded with people who were a good influence on him.  I think it's okay to have friends who aren't Christian but I don't really think it's a good idea for a Christian to have a nonChristian as a best friend only because the people who are the closest to you have a huge impact on your life.  So maybe he thought that he should surround himself with Christians as close friends because they might be a better influence for him.  You have to think about what God would want for you.  Sometimes He wants you to stay in a person's life (because you're a good influence on them and maybe sometimes even lead them to God) or get out of that person's life (because that person is making you into someone that God doesn't want you to be).  You have to ask yourself who's changing in the relationship.  Am I changing for the worse or is my friend changing for the better?|`|RZetcwalaa	No its an entertaining mix of irrelevant fanciful stories (Ruth) bizarre commandments (Leviticus and Deuteronomy) and a healthy dose of wrong predictions (Revelations)... Religion brainwashes the bible merely entertains... <br>  <br>  There are only a few passages in the bible that deal with social relations with 'unbelievers' the strongest which says something along the lines of  "do not be unevenly yoked by the unbeleiver" (that is in the NT we all know about the infamous mosaic stoning laws)... Not exactly "disown those who don't believe in god" now is it?"<br>  <br>  Jesus spent as much time as he could with the tax collecters etc... Follow his example... <br>  <br>  @Ruth, how impossibly rude of you<br>  @crimthan THANKYOU why cant christians play nice and do it by JC's rules.|`|XTfrow5Saa	Dude.. pick up a Bible and read it for yourself. I would almost bet my next paycheck that the people who are bashing the Bible have never read it from Gensis to maps..ever.. The Bible will brainwash you. It will alter your personality. But if you are like the average person, your brain is full of trash that needs to be washed out. You didn't create yourself. You did not choose your gender, color, parents or anything along those lines. Somebody else did. That somebody had a manual written just for you to learn about him and what your purpose is.|`|fc9oxG8iaa	The Bible should not be a definitive absolute of life. To do so would be to live in the same way as desert people of X00 BCE who survived by conquering lands that they claimed were theirs by birthright. To follow the book to a T would be to be fundamentalist, and we've all seen where that ends -cough- www.godhatesfags.com -cough-.<br>  <br>  The Bible is not the personality alterer, it is those who preach it. The friend obviously had a void that was filled by this preaching, otherwise he would not have listened, therefore this was played upon. To be a good christian isn't what should matter in a friend anyway, I know many of them and despite occasional arguments on the topic we get along fine (parents, for instance). It's whether or not they are a good person that counts.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	The Holy Bible is the only Word of God. And it teaches us believers to carefully mind the company we keep.<br>  <br>  2Cr 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? <br>  <br>  <br>   2Cr 6:15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? <br>  <br>  <br>   2Cr 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. <br>  <br>  <br>   2Cr 6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you, <br>  <br>  <br>   2Cr 6:18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	No, the Bible has nothing to do with brainwashing and altering personalities.  Its just a book, after all.<br>  <br>  Its (some) churches that are responsible for pressuring members to conform and toe the line.  Once you've found a new community or social circle like a church congregation to belong to, you don't want to be ostracized or thought badly of by your new friends.  So you go along with what they want you to think and believe in order to fit in.|`|AA12194228	I think this is a really sad story, but I believe it. It is funny how judgmental some "newbies" become. Very silly and unChristian behavior.<br>  <br>  Or perhaps it is like rehab for drug dependent people, and avoid the contact that they not fall on the "slippery slope". <br>  Tt bad if that is their motivation, because they can be believers and live as Jesus wants, and still be normal people having normal people fun. It is not sinfull.|`|yHfsHp6naa	The bible merely provides the context for religious organizations to implement their highly effective indoctrination.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Maybe this friend of your friend found something more meaningful than you can possibly grasp.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	You start out with a sad but interesting story that has so many important questions that could be addressed and you have to end it with a troll remark?  So sad.<br>  <br>  To answer the real questions.  If Jesus could eat, drink, and party with the scum of the Earth (that is everyone) we should follow his example.  Some exceptions would be those that have had addictions.  It would be ill advised for an alcoholic to hang at a bar, but that does not mean you abandon your friends.  After all why would you want to hog the good news?  Why would you keep it from your friend?  Keeping ties with your friend and continuing your relationship is how others can come to know the Lord.<br>  <br>  Good thing God is not that way or we would still be under the law.|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	No it is not.<br>  <br>  What many Christians and most non-christians do not understand is we Christians are suppose to be friendly to everyone regardless of their religion but we are to only be friends with Christians.<br>  <br>  If we run around with non-Christians then we are saying that the life they lead is okay and we are mocking God.|`|uurTX7POaa	I see you are a great fan of false dichotomies (try NOT to move your lips when you read this). <br>  I thought Mao ("religion is poison") was a true authority on brainwashing and altering personalities, he claimed 40,000,000 lives. Are you bothered by this ?<br>  EDIT: RESPECT THE FIST, where exactly are *Revelations* in the Bible ? please tell us...|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Yes.

I know you won't, so I'll explain it to you ~ in a nutshell.<br>  <br>  The Bible is about God. It is an unfolding narrative that tells of His interactions with mankind. We learn about His character through the successes and the failings of individuals and nations, and we learn about his love for us, as demonstrated through Jesus. The Bible tells us how He sees us, and what the consequences are for our sins. It also tells us how to come to Christ, and that only those who belong to him will inherit eternal life.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like your neighbor's friend has had an encounter with God. It changes your life you know. The Bible says that old things pass away and everything becomes new ~ we become new creatures in Christ.

nEc0L0MRaa	Many men these days grew up in single households, the one with just mom created an atmosphere of resentment, she wasn't always there to love, and sometimes had to lay down the law.  She may have felt guilty and allowed her children to take their anger out on her.  Or in the case of a single dad, men are often bitter and angry when they have to do 'woman's work' they find it demeaning to them.  As a result, many men who grow in this environment, resent women for their abandonment.  <br>  <br>  Now girls when raised like this are different, it's just the hard wiring of our brains that changes things, but those are different behavioral problems.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that there must be two parents for a child to grow right, or that there must be two parents of a different gender.  I am saying it takes a village to raise a child, and we are all part of that village.  My sister's husband is deployed, my brother has stepped up to help raise those children.

AA11232725	Theoretically, the universe "could" always have been there. However, according to the laws of this universe something always comes from something else that preceded it. So if the universe has always been here then we have quite a mystery on our hands explaining why it should be here in the first place.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that God is an eternal Spirit and that He is not subject to the physical laws of this universe that He created.

UHfjV57raa	Who is Canada's head of state?<br>  The British Queen. Queen Elizabeth II.<br>  <br>  What is a governer general?<br>  In Canada, it's Michaelle Jean. The role is majorly ceremonial. The governor general signs official documents and meets regularly with the prime minister and government officials. She has the right to be consulted, to encourage and to warn.The governor general presides over the swearing-in of the prime minister, the Chief Justice of Canada and cabinet ministers. One of the governor general’s most important responsibilities is to ensure that Canada always has a prime minister and a government in place. It is tradition that the GG rotate between French heritage and English heritage - but this is no law, merely convention. Appointed by the sovereign on the prime minister's recommendation.

wOA2Mf6Naa	The butt uglies?
9CCtt077aa	I guess "crapbag" answered your question in a way, but I also slightly disagree with him/her. Yes, breasts are a sign of fertility, but aren't hips and other parts of the woman that as well? I mean, a skinny woman with no curves (particularly no hips) doesn't really represent fertility or sexiness. At least not in my opinion. A woman with a really skinny waist and big breasts simply accentuates the breasts - and that's what men notice. I really don't think men find it disgusting for a woman to have fat in other areas than the breasts, but it's just a reaction they're expected to have or display. It all has to do with today's warped society.<br>  <br>  I'm a young European guy (Scandinavian to be exact) and I think, quite honestly, that this obsession with anorexic women is mostly an American thing. Yes, women here in Europe are insecure as well, but I think the Americans are extreme when it comes to worshipping thin (and fake) women. There are plenty of curvy women on European TV shows. At least compared to American shows. The fashion industry is infested with freaks to begin with - and I think most intelligent and mature men know that. Any man who uses the fashion/celebrity world as a reference for what type of women he should find attractive, is a tool. Nothing else. Big women can be (and are) million times healthier than a skinny or average sized woman. The media is to blame for the fact that big girls have gotten such a bad image. It's truly a tragedy. A lot of skinny and neurotic women are to blame as well. They feel so incredibly threatened by bigger, curvier, softer and more feminine women. <br>  <br>  As for my own personal taste, well I like my women to be big ALL over. Hips, breasts, belly, thighs - everything. And I'm as white (and slim/athletic) as you can get. lol Not only black guys like big girls. That's an extremely weird and offensive American stereotype. I mean, if that would be the case, then who's dating all the big and beautiful women in Europe? Any smart and REAL man would choose a curvy woman over a skinny twig in a second. SO many men secretly crave bigger girls. Sad really. Why not just be open about it?!<br>  <br>  One last thing - I really disagree with you that breasts are just bags of fat. Honestly, to me they are art. They are so incredibly erotic and sensual - I can't really explain it. But then again, I guess I just really love boobs (only natural ones, though). :)<br>  <br>  Edit: If anyone is unsure how gorgeous big women can be, then they should watch Federico Fellini's film "Amarcord". You can see clips from the film on Youtube. It won an Oscar in 1974, I believe. The tobacconist, a character in the movie - played by Maria Antonietta Beluzzi, is probably  one of the most memorable BBW's in movie history. Nighthawk, you should see it, if you haven't already. This movie changed my life. Seriously.|`|FMwckpMbaa	Because boobs are aesthetically pleasing, and big bellies are not.<br>  <br>  Plus fat in those places has relations with being unhealthy.<br>  But the fat in the breasts is feminine and motherly.<br>  <br>  Hey, it's just the truth. I'm talking from a biology stand point.|`|yTtzV7K4aa	I see what you mean, and I agree with you but most of the world doesn't so..... Something else that confuses me is why guys are always going on and on about how they like big butts but then they turn around and say use it as an insult like "that woman's butt is so big". I do not get it, it should either be an insult or a compliment not both.|`|EXurNsB4aa	Well you're simplifying it too much.  Certain areas of the body are symbolic.  Breasts represent femininity, motherhood, stuff like that.  That helps explain why the fat is more acceptable.|`|zDJ26bktaa	Hey man there are chubby chasers too you know ;)

gAOAdOHraa	Try a different style of thong.  Sometimes they are too stringy and basically made of nothing.  You can get them with a bit more fabric on them (so you don't feel like you are wearing a diaper) but they should sit better like normal underwear.  Also if you get them in cotton they well be a lot better for you.  What about the other type...sort of in between a thong and bikini underwear (can't think of what they are called).|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Well, if you're trying to be flirty, then I don't see how having a really cute guy see thong straps is a "nightmare".  That's very flirty to a guy.<br>  <br>  Alternative.  Go commando.  Bonus:  a chance to show some "butt cleavage".  Well, if you're feeling really flirty.|`|LABC73E7aa	You may not want to hear this answer, but you need to.  What you should worry about is this hypothetical "cute guy" thinking about the fact that thong underwear transfers bacteria from your anus to your vagina, thus making them unsanitary and unsafe!  You would be better off wearing no underwear!  You are just welcoming a nasty vaginal infection by wearing thong/g-string underwear!  What do you think "cute guys" would think about that?!|`|t2FDjNSiaa	its possible that the size you are purchasing is a bit too large.  maybe try a different size that wraps below your hip line.  try a different style of strings|`|Q4NFFBizaa	go commando!|`|AA10104545	I'm sorry, but isn't that the point of a thong?|`|U5g6kSa7aa	Honestly, thongs are made to go there!

ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	I'm going to back around to basics. Pendulums are talent amplifiers. They have nothing to do with any kind of entity, but you. Apparently you have a talent. Now you have to patiently work at stating what is your conscious question and then letting your talent control. This is especially true when you are seeking an answer for another.      <br>  <br>  If you are seeking for another have them place their hand lightly on the top of the hand holding the pendulum. <br>  <br>  The pendulum will follow your instinctive movement of head shakes for yes or no. A circle is an unclear or mixed answer. <br>  <br>  After you work with the pendulum for a good while, you'll find it moving in a figure eight or infinite sign. This can mean two things. There are two absolutely different answers, but they are consequence answers and only one should be used.  When the consequence answers do not complete the pattern of infinity means the question has an infinite amount of answers.<br>  <br>  It will take time and patience and some aggravation, so always remember the hardest person to understand and work with is our-self and our talents.|`|l6LUNx9yaa	The answers for a pendulum are different for different people. For some, a clockwise rotation answer means yes, a counter clockwise answer means no and a back and forth means ask again or maybe.  For other people, a forward and back ward motion from the body means yes while a side to side swinging means no, and a circular motion means ask again or maybe. <br>  <br>  Your best chance is to sit with a clear mind, without thinking of a question and ask for a "yes" motion. After words ask for a "no" motion.  This will tell you how the pendulum will answer you for future questions.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	First you ask your pendulum to give you a "yes", watch it's action. Next ask for a "no" and watch that action. Now you have your "yes "and your "no" basis for your pendulum.|`|CC7G2eGGaa	It can mean that the spirit or ghost will not answer your question, or they don't understand or know what you're asking.|`|Ai6gfTrxaa	sorry but im going with ghost wont answer|`|dFBccLExaa	Depends on the pendulum. Some pendulums answer in lines and not circles. I've got one pendulum that answers yes in a clockwise circle and no is a vertical line. You have to ask it to show you what yes and no is.
OsY0lmTCaa	The NPO I work for is part of a national campaign called Healthcare for America Now (HCAN). While, at this time, I don't know of any work specifically to pay for SRS it wouldn't surprise me if this issue were to open the door to it. <br>  <br>  I advice contacting your Senate and House Reps and asking them if they support the principles that HCAN is fighting for. If they do than you know that they are fighting for you to receive the best possible healthcare available. If they aren't then you know that they likely won't support us in the fight to make Transition a procedure that should be covered.<br>  <br>  The first link in my sources section is to HCANs website so that you can gain more information on this issue.<br>  <br>  The second link is to congress.org. By entering your zipcode you can find who YOUR congressmen and women are and how to contact them.<br>  <br>  I do hope that we can have transition covered in the near future.|`|65QqZBnjaa	Not likely.  Much more education needs to be done before we'll ever reach that point.  I'm guessing at least 10 more years.  Some private insurance companies are starting to add SRS, but progress there is slow as well.  All I can say is save your pennies and have patience.|`|OhhKRahTaa	If gays get cured.|`|3OZgcntfaa	What health insurance program are you talking about in Canada?<br>  <br>  We have provincial health care. And those have varying degrees of HRT & SRS coverage.<br>  <br>  An average of twenty to thirty persons per province qualify for SRS under provincial health care each year. Most of the time they don't get SRS fully funded or even partially funded.|`|swkhohjgaa	The insurance companies are going to fight paying for SRS tooth and nail till the bitter end. The cost to them will be very high if it is covered. But their is hope. The AMA has called for an end to discrimination by insurance companies in the covered treatments for transgender folk. Keep your fingers crossed|`|kmd2lJOIaa	I doubt it will any time soon.  With the recession and such, I'm sure insurance companies will be cutting back on everything.

AA11521494	This has to be answered in two parts as the C of E contains a wide variation of belief and practice.  One thing common to all is that the congregation will receive both bread and wine in the C of E.<br>  <br>  Anglo-Catholic services within the C of E are almost the same as catholic mass itself - they call the service mass, and the ceremonies will look the same.  The key difference is they will use the service book "Common Worship" instead of the missal, though some parishes do in fact go as far as breaking the law and using the words of the catholic mass.  In such parishes you will see the congregation crossing themselves at appropriate points, as do catholics.<br>  <br>  Evangelicals within the C of E will use the same service book but do it in a much less ceremonial way, like a nonconformist communion service but with anglican vestments.  Nobody in such a church would be seen crossing themselves.<br>  <br>  There is also every variety in between.  You will also find that the less ceremonial the church, the less often it has mass/communion services - anglo-catholics will have mass for almost every service, while evangelicals will keep holy communion to the legal minimum of once a week.<br>  <br>  It is VERY difficult to generalise anything about the C of E!|`|wxBFZ41Taa	CoE is Protestant. The King (or Queen) of England is the head of the Church. Catholics look to the Pope as God's authority on earth. <br>  <br>  At Mass, therefore, Catholics receive the Body and Blood of Christ under the appearances of bread and wine. Protestants receive bread and wine (or grape juice) as a memorial or symbol of the Last Supper. <br>  <br>  Catholics believe in the Real Presence as taught by Christ, Protestants do not. <br>  <br>  As far as crossing themselves, I have no idea if CoE does this or not.|`|AA12136918	very little  but it depends on the church  some Anglican churches seem more catholic than the catholic ones  the main difference  they take  Communion as symbolic  not literally Jesus' body and blood.   and not in all churches will people  cross themselves.  but basically the service is the same.  possible  more singing and a longer service  though. not so many people  coming in late and leaving straight after Communion either.|`|zRyI5CMGaa	I know higher C Of E take Communion, they are very similar in some of their theology with the Catholic Church.

If you do that by worshiping Buddha, or Jesus, or Allah or whatever then you have achieved all that you need to. In the movie dogma there is a great line where Chris Rock's character says something to the effect of "No one's gotten it right yet, but they have the idea".

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

They see these idiots on televangelist programming and other situation where people use religion to feed their greed and live hypocritical lives and they lump us all in the same category because that gives them the convenient excuse to avoid any type of acknowledgment of God unless its based on their own terms. So its a vicious circle that they are trapped in. Christianity is for the most part only "slightly cool" as long as it's a hip movie or sound track or endorsement from a celebrity. At the very least its seen as boring or a delusion to most because they have been led to believe that the Word of God is esoteric, vague and to obscure for our times. Often  they base their opinions on badly or falsely conveyed doctrine or Biblical accounts from when they were growing up and never truly took the Bible in hand and studied it for themselves. So opinions are low of it and us and God Himself because people just won't understand...it's too much work, trouble and effort in a world where there are too many distractions and ill concern. Strangely enough..these people are talked of so much in the Bible and they dont' even know that God was concerned enough of them that He would see their ways and know how they would go well before hand...<br>  <br>  <br>  Proverbs 29:18<br>  Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.<br>  <br>  Hosea 4:6<br>  My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.<br>  <br>  Matthew 13:15<br>  For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.<br>  <br>  A christian doesn't just acknowledge the Law but understands that the Giver of the Law also redeems them. That is not self rightiousness but we are often blamed and called this very thing. We don't make ourselves rightious at all. It is Christ that stands in our stead. Yet these non-believers see the same laws as we do, most of them and follow them without acknowledging the giver and call themselves moral and "good". Yet they are good by their own standards. When a wrong is committed their is rationalizing and excuses and then self forgiveness which causes a severe lack of conscience. Something that I believe is become endemic of society...the sheer gall and glorification even of some reprobate behavior and lack of remorse, even in young people and children. So this scripture holds true too...<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:12 <br>   12And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.<br>  <br>  So with the Christian era soon over and the approach of secular humanism and world wide eugenics and socialism...you can bet that the next generations will have whatever mutual care and compassion taught out of them. Natural sympathy for even ones own family members will be rare much less for that of a stranger. It will be, in this nnext decade a time of "life unworthy of life". So we will also be back as prophecied in the Roman Empire where only the elite were safe and able to flourish and pursue. You can see it happening now. Certain faiths will always be accepted...because they are "cool"...Eastern philosophy and religion, Islam because of fear and peace by tolerance, Judaism because of the holocaust, pagan faith systems because they are considered harmless and a joke...but Christianity...outside the Roman Catholic faith which is the mother of false religion...will always be a target...everywhere and its because of the hatred of satan against the son of God that you will be his enemy also because you believe in the Bible. So, if you are being ridiculed..its because you are on the right path and be very glad of that.

Not to mention I was pregnant when I got married, luckily it was my soul mate who got me pregnant and none of the a$$h0les before him.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	I waited till I got married and it was nice to give myself to one person. It was very special. I don't think much good comes out of having premarital sex.. Its like why would u want to give urself to someone that ur not going to spend ur life with. i just really don't get it, but hey that's just me. I mean really, Why would u want a bunch of different men inside of you..think about it|`|8TmK8Qklaa	the actual sex itself.|`|kHx1upOpaa	1 in 4 teenage girls has a std|`|veufnjsNaa	I believe that it is expressing your right as a human being to choose what you want to do with your body whether you are a girl or a boy.<br>  Nobody in this world owns your body, but by waiting till you are married to have sex demonstrates that you let others control your body and mindset.<br>   Premarital sex is fine because it helps you know your preferences in sex and what satisfies you or not. Its healthy just like pullinhg out a book to read or doodling.|`|KKeLsvyGaa	What good comes out of having sex before marriage? <br>  <br>  Typical scenario: Have sex before your ready, break up, find someone new, do it again...<br>  <br>  By the time you actually settle down with someone, you had sex more times than you can count.<br>  <br>  Just wait, okay? That's what I'm doing. <br>  <br>  Giving yourself to one person for the first time during marriage is so sacred and special.|`|AA12023455	I've never been married, but I have some good memories that I can remember again and again.<br>  <br>  Seriously, this is like asking what's good about:<br>  <br>  Movies<br>  Sports (playing or watching, unless it's your job)<br>  Ice Cream, Pizza, Steak (any good-tasting food that isn't extremely healthy)<br>  Learning about anything that won't pay you $$ <br>  <br>  <br>  and any other enjoyable experience that doesn't necessarily have a long-term goal. <br>  <br>  For most of these things, life just seems a little less harsh and a little more worthwhile after partaking thereof. Of course some of these things should be done in moderation.|`|ugMlQN1haa	you get to know if you and your partner are sexually compatible. <br>  When the woman ejaculates (yes, women can too) they release a hormone called oxytocin and that creates a bond between them and the person they are having sex with. Sex is a big part of the relationship a lot of marriages have been broken because one partner was not satisfied sexually with their husband or wife, so they had to cheat. You don't want to marry someone and later find out they can't even get it up, i know this is a stupid analogy but you can't buy a car without test driving it, so I would say *I* wouldn't be able to marry without knowing my partners sexual pleasures and whatnot.|`|d625e50e2f5b3add3c58e3d7531fd74caa	I suppose you could discover if you're sexually compatible. My personal opinion, however, would find that supposition to be rather specious (due to complications with emotional issues) although I suppose it could be proffered as a so called "good".

AA11989753	"And as it is appointed unto men once to die after this comes judgment." Hebrews 9:27<br>  <br>  We must believe in hell because the Bible warns us about it over and over again (Matthew 10:28; 23:33; Mark 9:43-47; Luke 16:23). But why would a loving God condemn anyone to hell? Because we have all sinned against Him and have broken His law. "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).<br>  <br>  It is a fact that most people's consciences tell them not to kill, steal, and commit rape. Our laws also show that it is wrong to do these things. No one protests when our police officers throw people into jail because they have committed these horrible crimes. Why? Because you know that evildoers must be punished. Let's talk about another example: What kind of judge would appoint a murder to prison? A mighty good one would!<br>  <br>  If a judge were to set criminals free without the punishment specified in the law, that judge would be unjust and would have to be dismissed from the bench. In the same way, a mighty good and holy God would also condemn a sinner or a person to hell that chooses to remain separated from Him in their sins. If He didn't, He would not be a righteous and just God.<br>  <br>  When you stand before God one day at His judgment seat, on what basis do you think that you will have a right to enter heaven and avoid the torments of hell? God says absolutely none by your own standards! Romans 3:10 says; "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one". <br>  <br>  Sin separates mankind from God. What is sin anyway? Take a look at God's standard of righteousness and test yourself to see if you have broken any of His laws.<br>  <br>  1). Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Have you always obeyed God's word and put it ahead of your own wants? Do you even know what it says? Have you always put God first in every area of your life? Have you always loved Him with all of your heart, mind, soul and strength? If you answer no to any of these, you have broken God's 1st commandment. <br>  <br>  2). Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. Have you ever put a material thing like money, a car, or a career ahead of God? Did you ever have your own beliefs about God rather than the ones that are revealed in the Bible? If so, you are an idolater - you have broken God's 2nd commandment. <br>  <br>  3). Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain. Have you ever used God's name as a swear word? If so, you are profane - you have broken God's 3rd commandment <br>  <br>  4). Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Have you always kept the sabbath holy? If not, you are a sabbath-breaker - you have broken God's 4th commandment. <br>  <br>  5). Honour thy father and thy mother. Have you ever disobeyed or spoken evil of your parents? Have you ever been rebellious against them in any way, even as a child or a teenager? If so, you are rebellious and disobedient - you have broken God's 5th Commandment. <br>  <br>  6). Thou shalt not kill. The Bible says that if we hate someone, we commit murder in our hearts. Have you ever hated someone or had evil thoughts toward another person? If so, you are a murderer at heart - you have broken God's 6th commandment. (Matthew 5:21-22) <br>  <br>  7). Thou shalt not commit adultery. Have you always been faithful to your spouse? Have you ever had sex with anyone before you were married (fornication)? Have you ever engaged in sexual fantasies or lustful thoughts about anyone not your spouse? If so, you are an adulterer - you have broken God's 7th commandment. (Matthew 5:27-28) <br>  <br>  8). Thou shalt not steal. Have you ever taken anything that didn't belong to you, no matter how small in value? If so, you are a thief - you have broken God's 8th commandment. <br>  <br>  9). Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Have you ever told a lie, a fib, white lie, or half truth about someone else? Have you ever spoken anything about anyone knowing that it was not completely and totally true? If so, you are a liar - you have broken God's 9th commandment. <br>  <br>  10). Thou shalt not covet. Have you ever desired to have something that someone else has - a girl or guy, a car, a house, a job, or anything else? If so, you are covetous - you have broken God's 10th commandment. <br>  <br>  Everyone that has ever lived (except the Lord Jesus Christ) has broken at least one of these commandments. Most of us have probably broken most of them. <br>  <br>  HEAR THE WORDS OF GOD!<br>  <br>  "... no murderer hath eternal life..." (1 John 3:15)<br>  <br>  "Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>  <br>  "but the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone..." (Revelation 21:8)<br>  <br>  When you - a murderer, a thief, an adulterer, a liar - stand before the righteous Judge of all the universe, how could He not require that justice be satisfied by exacting the due penalty for your sins in the fires of hell?<br>  <br>  Even though God's own creation had disobeyed Him, He still loved us so much that He gave the ultimate sacrifice so we could be forgiven of our sins."But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).<br>  <br>  The debt of sin has been paid in full by Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God! When you believe in Jesus Christ and invite Him into your life, He washes away every sin you have ever committed.<br>  <br>  God is holy and cannot allow anyone with sin into heaven. That is why we need the righteousness of Christ to cover us. This must be done by believing in Jesus Christ and by accepting Him as your Savior and submitting to Him as the Lord of your life. Making Jesus your Savior means that you believe that Jesus died so you could be forgiven. Making Jesus your Lord means that you put Him first in your life. Your submitting to His authority allows Him to begin making necessary changes in your life.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	There is no heaven, and there is no hell, unless you are talking about Dallas, TX.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	There is no empirical evidence for any afterlife.  It is unlikely that there are such places.|`|QKs0PFVpaa	it isnt real.<br>  <br>  you could go loads of places, you could become a ghost, you could loose all consiousness, your body would decay but that wouldn't matter, you've lost your mind and you won't notice it.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|qTUaHHcDaa	Friend ,<br>  You come out of your body [ O B E ],and are sort of earth bound for a short period ,and then you enter the spirit world ,and await the Resurrection with those of your family who have died before you.<br>  There is a progression in this place as knowledge of the plan of happiness or the true gospel of Jesus Christ is proclaimed here to those who never had the opportunity  while on the earth.<br>  God bless.|`|veufnjsNaa	heaven and hell were made up so people would be conscious about their misdeeds but also to comfort them that they would not just be forgooten once they die. Heaven is made for people to feel that they are going to a better place and not just decompose, which is really whats gonna happen.

Since the beginning of time, God has sent His guidance through these chosen people. They were human beings who taught the people around them about faith in One Almighty God, and how to walk on the path of righteousness. Some prophets also revealed God's Word through books of revelation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Additional: Muslims read about, learn from, and respect all of the prophets. In addition, when mentioning the name of any one of them, a Muslim adds these words of blessing and respect: "upon him be peace" (alayhi salaam in Arabic).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|OugNf0x6aa	Depending on the sect, the prophet they follow is Muhammad and one of the cousins.|`|eshummTJaa	Larry, Moe and Curly...

NAL9SZuXaa	i didnt bother to read the whole thing, but i totally agree with you.<br>  <br>  Ever since 2000 (G.W. Bush), Israel has been protected/supported by him. That's honestly why I believe that the Gaza strip was invaded after he left office (tryna stay safe). It's possible that people might seek rectification for the holocaust (probably) by defending them. <br>  <br>  However, what Israel is doing was/is completely horrible & it definately changed my view of that country.<br>  <br>  There's this distorted view that Jewish is good and Islam is bad (even though both have their flaws). But what happens when most of the killings and tortures occur more with muslim citizens than with Jewish citizens? people are people no matter what faith...& that mess is not right at all!...<br>  <br>  Hiding the truth makes many people happy|`|PCpC4iS1aa	I hate jews|`|URjBYtGeaa	Antisemitic bastard... <br>  you should be ashamed of yourself to convince yourself and others that Israel wants to use violence against others just for the sake of killing others. obviously Israel has to defend herself against the whole flipping Middle East, where pretty much everyone is against them. I mean look at map, Israel is the size of flipping New Jersey while there are like 20 monstrous countries surrounding it, planning some vicious attack to annihilate a country that only has like 10 million peaceful people. You know Im sick of all these lies by Palestinians that Israel is just using propaganda to gain support or sympathy from other countries. Its sickening and repulsive. You cant rely on a stupid little newspaper article, that its the truth. they probably are under heavy bias against Israel for no apparent reason|`|vMJV1Jf0aa	Many have the misconception that Israel is the best friend America ever had and they would back us in a heartbeat. Nothing could be further from the truth. Israel will only do what benefits them.<br>  We give them about 3-4 billion dollars in aid every year and share our military technology with them and they sell it to  China.<br>  <br>  Anytime you hear of someone caught spying in the USA for an "Undisclosed country" that country is our good friend Israel.<br>  <br>  Answer to the question; because we are constantly bombarded with the 'Holocaust' and anyone who dares question the Jews is an anti--semetic, racist, Neo-nazi.

3DjUX8etaa	My all time favorite is from Saint Francis of Assisi. " Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words."  God Bless!  +?+|`|AA11232725	Romans 5:8  But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.<br>  <br>  Romans 8:38  For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,  39  nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  Philippians 2:5  Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,  6  who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,  7  but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.  <br>  <br>  8  And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. <br>  <br>   9  Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name,  10  that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,  11  and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br>  <br>  Yet, in an extraordinarily staggering statement about Jesus Christ, Napoleon said something that is almost unexcelled by any political leader.  I quote it at length because of its incredible insight.  I only wish I had it with me when I met with these generals.  Napoleon expressed these thoughts while he was exiled on the rock of St. Helena.  There, the conqueror of civilized Europe had time to reflect on the measure of his accomplishments.  He called Count Montholon to his side and asked him, "Can you tell me who Jesus Christ was?"  The count declined to respond.  Napoleon countered: <br>  <br>  Well then, I will tell you.  Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne and I myself have founded great empires; but upon what did these creations of our genius depend?  Upon force.  Jesus alone founded His empire upon love, and to this very day millions will die for Him.... I think I understand something of human nature; and I tell you, all these were men, and I am a man:  none else is like Him; Jesus Christ was more than man.... I have inspired multitudes with such an enthusiastic devotion that they would have died for me.... but to do this it was necessary that I should be visibly present with the electric influence of my looks, my words, of my voice.  When I saw men and spoke to them, I lighted up the flame of self-devotion in their hearts.... Christ alone has succeeded in so raising the mind of man toward the unseen, that it becomes insensible to the barriers of time and space.  Across a chasm of eighteen hundred years, Jesus Christ makes a demand which is beyond all others to satisfy; He asks for that which a philosopher may seek in vain at the hands of his friends, or a father of his children, or a bride of her spouse, or a man of his brother.  He asks for the human heart; He will have it entirely to Himself.  He demands it unconditionally; and forthwith His demand is granted.  Wonderful!  In defiance of time and space, the soul of man, with all its powers and faculties, becomes an annexation to the empire of Christ.  All who sincerely believe in Him, experience that remarkable, supernatural love toward Him.  This phenomenon is accountable; it is altogether beyond the scope of man's creative powers.  Time, the great destroyer, is powerless to extinguish this sacred flame; time can neither exhaust its strength nor put a limit to its range.  This is it, which strikes me most; I have often thought of it.  This is which proves to me quite convincingly the Divinity of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  1.

We had the hookah going, people were smoking weed, there was alcohol everywhere, and loud music. It was sooooo tight. I just remember getting really drunk, then at about like 2 am, we hear knocks on the door. OH SHIIIT! It was the cops. It got busted. He came in, told my friend Victoria GET OUT OF THE BED YOU LITTLE TEENY BOPPER! hahaha. and he questioned us all about our age and stuff. He had our parents come & pick us upp. Before we left I was all talking to the cop all drunk and stuff hahaha hes like whats your name and I'm like Lucy hes like where are you from I'm like ...

But in Rev 11:8, "the great city" is said to be "where their Lord was crucified" and Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem and not in Rome. So, Babylon in Revelation refers to Jerusalem. <br>  <br>  2. Rev 17:9 says, Bablyon sits on "seven mountains." But according to the Bible, "the mountains are round about Jerusalem" (Psalm 125:3) and according to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem was built on seven mountains [Mount Acra, Mount Bezetha, Mount Gareb, Mount Goath, Mount Moriah, Mount Ophel, and Mount Zion]. And, Rome was not built on seven mountains but on seven hills: Palatine, Aventine, Capitoline, Quarinal, Viminal, Esquiline and Caelian. (Notice that Vatican Hill upon which the Vatican, the headquarters of the Catholic Church, is built is not among the seven hills of Rome.) So, Babylon in Revelation refers to Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  3. Rev 18:21-24 says, "Babylon the great city ... in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints." But Jesus lamented, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you" (Matt 23:36) and St. Paul says, "in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. (Acts 26:9-10). And, as far as I know, no Jewish prophet was ever killed in Rome. So, Babylon in Revelation refers to Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  4. Rev 17:15 says, "The waters that you saw, where [Bablyon] the harlot is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues." But elsewhere the Bible says, "there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven" (Acts 2:5). So, Babylon in Revelation refers to Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  5. Rev 17:16 says, "And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate [Bablyon] the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire." But Jesus said, "O Jerusalem...Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate." (Matt 23:36-37) So, Babylon in Revelation refers to Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  6. Rev 18:4 says, "Come out of her [Babylon], my people." But Jesus said, "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. ... let those who are inside the city depart" (Luke 21:20-21). So, Babylon in Revelation refers to Jerusalem.|`|qVcDlp9Raa	It is astrological , the only problem is it is supposed to cause a magnetic shift, the reality is we are over due and it should happen in our life time.|`|Nxolwd5Baa	i think the mayan calendar comes to an end so the mayan people still alive will probably start using our calendar, plus my daughter will be 17 and ehm, the world might end or sumthing|`|bb2fb83f62e8d0f381f54d42036a5791aa	They think it will be the first day of winter for that year just like anyone else that doesn't get freaked out!!!!! over nothing.

This is not the true Catholic Mass but a Protestantized version concocted by Modernist Catholics (read heretics) and Protestants. Furthermore s the Modernists leaders in Rome have changed the rite of ordination for the priesthood resulting in dubious ordinations (read invalid) and have also changed the rite of episcopal consecrations that shed positive doubts on the validity of bishops. So it is quite possible that we have invalid bishops ordaining invalid priests who then celebrate invalid masses. So, sadly, what used to confer an increase in sanctifying grace on Catholics who worthily received Holy Communion, now they recieve nothing more than a wafer.<br>  <br>  To find the true One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ for the dispensation of mercy and outside of which absolutely no one is saved, you need to understand that the Roman Catholic Church is no longer the Church in Rome. Thus I direct you to the first two websites below to find the true Catholic Faith, Mass, Priesthood and Sacraments. The third website is one that will let you see what kind of nonsense is going on in a the Modernist "Catholic" Parish near you. <br>  <br>  Now to rebuke anyone who fails to discern the true presence of Jesus Christ where there can be no doubt of the validity of the Sacrament we read in Sacred Scripture:<br>  <br>  "For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall show the death of the Lord, until he come. 27 Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice. 29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord."|`|2TavF36Daa	The Priest serving the girl's school knows she isn't Catholic.

However. you must realize that if she did not take communion some problems could arise for her. she could be outcast from her peers or even harassed by them. people are very strange today and wish only to accept what they believe and see as to be true. they refuse to realize that opinions are not wrong or right. i believe you should leave her to do as she pleases, but let her know (in an extreme polite manner) that if that isn't what she believes that you as a catholic believe she should not take communion because it is an insult to you. however you must realize the significant similarities between Christianity and Catholicism and realize that in her mind she may not be doing anything wrong. so if she doesn't see it the way you do, try to take her opinion into consideration =]|`|eAMq1iBWaa	ALL Christians partake of the Communion.

EFBUPnITaa	She falls into a coma after getting into a car accident on her way to pick up her "faithful" boyfriend,at least that's what she's believed for the last couple of years. Little did she know,he was actually sleeping with another girl by the age of nineteen for two years now. With his beautiful mistress, he had one daughter due to a mistake on a late night out. But the truth of the matter is, is that he is truly in love with his girlfriend whom he has been dating for about five years now. The main reason why he is sleeping with his mistress is because he is trying to get over his girlfriend simply because he now has a family to look after. After finding out that his girlfriend is now in a coma put this man into a deep and confused state of mind. Should he wait around or just move on and let her true sole mate go slowly and focus on what he has now?<br>  <br>  you like?ha'|`|LAYrMHPZaa	the girl is really an alien <br>  or<br>  the boy gets a desease and he travels the world<br>  or<br>  they the girl finds a cure for cancer but years later her boyfriend gets cancer and she cant cure him and shes blamed for everything
bRRNYsK8aa	hip hop & rap songs promoting homosexuality.? ehhh ... not in mainstream stuff ... they're all about being fakely " ghetto " & degrading women, so i'm not so sure you'd luck out over there. not in that genre at least. :| (though i have heard of some lesbian rap artist ... obv., her music must not be that great if i don't even know her name. :x)<br>  <br>  there is actually a lot of pro-homosexuality songs out there ... you just don't hear them out that much because of stupid society & it's effed up ways. (& don't get me started about that " i kissed a girl " crap ... talk about stupid. that's like a joke to the whole thing in itself. even if it is just a tad bit catchy. :x)<br>  <br>  if i were you, i'd do a little more research on it as far as the hip hop side goes ... though, tbh, i seriously doubt that much will turn up. however, there is quite a bit within the worlds of indie & dance music (as different from each other as they may be. hehe. :P). i found a lot of artists that way ... none which had appealed to me. but still. & then again, i hadn't exactly investigated that far anywho. :/<br>  <br>  just type it into google search or something ... i think more would turn up for you on your own searches than on here, but that's just me. good luck(:|`|BuOHv2XKaa	Gay Bash and Ive Got You both by Malagne Lavonne|`|8OXVSoe0aa	LMAO.<br>  #1.

xtKEToLHaa	Yes, SuperiorIntellect is totally right...<br>  <br>  Native Americans were originally Asians tribes that crossed the Bering Strait, 10 000 years ago...|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I have also thought this before. You can't say they are Asian if they are already Native American/Canadian. You could say that they might be of Asian origin.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	They originated from Siberia and during the ice-age they crossed the water between the Kamchatka peninsula and Alaska. So they are mongoloid/buryat or possibly one of the other many ethnic Asian groups in eastern Russia. I've been to Siberia so I've seen many of these Asian ethnic groups in East Russia and they do resemble native Americans.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Not sure what all those links are about, but Native Americans in much of the North American continent originated in what is now asia. However, they have developed separately for as much as 30K years, so it is not accurate to say that they are Asian.<br>  <br>  They do share common stock, but that is not really the same thing.<br>  Superior Intellect is employing definitions that have been outdated for about 40 years.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	They are the same race as Asians. Both Asians and Native Americans are apart of the Mongoloid race. This is due to the fact that Native Americans are descendants of Asians who crossed into the Americas from the Bering Strait.|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Yes, they came from Asia a long time ago but they're not "asian". They're native Americans. However they belong to the mongoloid group of people (which includes your general "asian" and other peoples living Eurasia and sometimes indigenous people).|`|jcK6EXpiaa	You mean the Yakama? And No, the first one doesn't look like a yakama, and the third picture looks like some mexican farm workers (which are common in that area, lots of apple farms and stuff) the rest of them I would single out as native, but Asain? PLEASE. and NO, the bearing straight MAY HAVE been frozen 10-15,000 years ago, yet native americans have been around for much much much longer than that. In Washington, not far from Yakama, the remains of a native person was found and carbon dated to be about 40,000 years old. If he came from asia, he swam. But he didn't, because we arent asain.<br>  <br>  By the way...europeans immigrated from asia to Europe 15,000 years ago. Before that, it was covered in ice. Google it. Its true.<br>  <br>  <br>  No, Native Americans are not related to Asians.<br>  No, Native Americans are not Mongolian, not a single Native American came from Mongolia.<br>  <br>  DNA has proven<br>  ? Native Americans had no Asian connection for at least 40,000 years.<br>  ? Native American DNA is unique to Native Americans…… Native Americans are not genetically similar to any other world population because they were isolated for so long. <br>  ? Native Americans are a single founding population…… There were no other populations in the America before or after the current Native American population. <br>  <br>  Native Americans have no relationship to Europeans. The only relationship Native Americans have to Asians is a back flow of Native American DNA into Asia.<br>  <br>  Europeans, have a closer relationship with Asians then Native Americans, because those populations were in Asia during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Native americans have a very distinct facial structure, which stereotypically is quite long, and skin tone is more red than that of asians.<br>  <br>  edit - yes they are decendents of the mongoloids, however, if you trace it back far enough, all humans desend from africa, however you don't say your african, you say your british, or american etc. so therefore, the native americans are american!<br>  <br>  plus america and asia are separate continents.|`|3ztjaDBaaa	Not culturally....<br>  <br>  they migrated over a land bridge from Asia up to Russia to Alaska in prehistory.<br>  <br>  but if you're going to call them Asian, you might as well call everybody African.

Some of these are actually very unhealthy... You could absorb a lot of chemicals in the process...<br>  <br>  At some point, the trend is going to reverse and women will return to leaving their pubic hair natural or just trimming it lightly...

And no, that is not her place in society. That is where women are placed in some societies and that doesn't make it right at all.

The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be  in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. 21 Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. Anyone who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them." <br>  <br>      22 Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?" <br>  <br>      23 Jesus replied, "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. 24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me. <br>  <br>      25 "All this I have spoken while still with you. 26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.<br>  <br>  Spare me- you quote the following: Psalms 83:18 KJV: "That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth." <br>  & ASV: "That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, Art the Most High over all the earth."<br>  <br>  <br>  Matthew 28:18<br>  <br>  18 Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me<br>  <br>  As you know this is the new covenant that we have with Jesus and it's by him, Jesus that we are to go to.  <br>  <br>  Look at it like this, I am not saying that Jesus is God.  But it's like a business, that the Father owns and now he has passed that on to the son, so you now have to deal with the son, as he now has all the "authority" given to him by the father.  The Father wants you to go to the son, not him, that's why he gave all "authority" to the son.

PKWHLbdfaa	The LDS or Mormon people do NOT pray to Jesus. Their position on this is best explained by their apostle Bruce R. McConkie. Here's what he said:<br>  <br>  "Let us set forth those doctrines and concepts that a gracious God has given to us in this day and which must be understood in order to gain eternal life. They are:<br>  <br>  We worship the Father and him only and no one else.<br>  <br>  We do not worship the Son and we do not worship the Holy Ghost. I know perfectly well what the scriptures say about worshipping Christ and Jehovah, but they are speaking in an entirely different sense--the sense of standing in awe and being reverentially grateful to Him who has redeemed us. Worship in the true and saving sense is reserved for God the first, the Creator."<br>  <br>  McConkie went on to explain that "Christ worked out his own salvation by worshiping the Father." He also said, "Our relationship with the Son is one of brother or sister in the pre-mortal life and one of being led to the Father by him while in this mortal sphere."<br>  <br>  So in essence, the LDS viewpoint is Jesus is showing us how to worship the father but isn't to be worshiped in any way since he's sort of our older brother.<br>  <br>  McConkie identified specific heresies relating to Jesus worship. "Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed." He added, "I wonder if it is not part of Lucifer's system to make people feel they are special friends of Jesus when in fact they are not following the normal and usual pattern of worship found in the true Church."<br>  <br>  Can you imagine an LDS apostle claiming that Satan inspires people to pray to Jesus?

AlUGue93aa	It is great to have joy in God and His constant abiding love of us.  It is equally great to have joy in being with other people.  Everyone is a part of His Body.  Being with anyone is being in His Presence.<br>  <br>  I do think that some show joy in different ways, though.  The Benedictines, Missionaries of Charity and Sisters of Charity seem to show joy through a peaceful repose in their faces.  They have kind smiles and words, too.  I think they are so often in conversation with God that a large part of them is not with us when they are with us.  They are joyfully, gratefully conversing with Him the whole time!  The Franciscans are full of external expressions of joy.  They smile, laugh and warmly greet you almost across the board.  They seem to transfer attention from their internal conversation with God to reflect Him outward toward you!<br>  <br>  Some of us in the Church may appear somber because we are busy judging ourselves or others.  Or perhaps we are absorbed in worry and fear.  Either way we have shut ourselves off from the love of God.  This is a sad and unnecessary state of being.  Reconciliation is a good and joyful thing.|`|lU285qgSaa	Should'nt the knowledge that we are safe in Christ be a happy and stress relieving factor?<br>  <br>  <br>  Matthew 6:<br>  16 “Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance.

So, people think of the religion as a gloomy prospect. Personally, I agree with you. Our faith should be a joyful one.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Unfortunately, since the Bible and its laws are eternal, Christianity is a gloomy religion, which must accept slavery, stoning and forcing a raped woman to marry her rapist.|`|01b75bbcd20c3e82e1a4500548e5dd11aa	Maybe it's all those faces twisted with anger as they shout bigotry and hatred in the name of their saviour at the anti-gay rallies.|`|xZet9Dunaa	Mine is|`|AA11297267	Gee, maybe because the most-used symbol for christianity (like your avatar) is a dead guy on a cross?<br>  <br>  Or maybe it's that around 50-60% of the christians I meet tell me that I'm going to hell because I don't believe in their made-up god for which there is no evidence of any kind...<br>  <br>  Or, just maybe, it's those TV preachers I see now and then -- all red-faced, sweaty, and screaming about how all of us immoral atheists are bringing god's horrible judgment upon this nation, and that if we don't like the "fact" that the US is a "christian" nation we should all go move to China...<br>  <br>  What do you think?<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	I think you are right - thanks for the joy and reminding us that it is important to be happy...<br>  <br>  However, one may read the biography of St. Francis of Assisi, where there is a story St. Francis relates that has to do with "perfect joy". If we are to really experience true and perfect joy, according to St. Francis, we may have to endure quite a bit of adversity in this world, Maybe that helps to account for our noticing the "gloomy", or sorrowful countenances of Christians and so many others in the world for that matter. They are just dealing with things as best they can. But again, you're right, we should "put on a happy face" as they say, and try to at least appear happy even in the face of adversity. There are times when that can serve us well...<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's good to be joyful for the most part, but we still have to be able to deal with what suffering we find ourselves dealing with. If everything's happy all of the time - that's also known as the "funny farm"... - not a politically or socially correct term  by any means, but accurately descriptive, nonetheless...|`|rTplTuEdaa	Many  so called Christian,s  are just that ,,so called..they sin<br>    and lie and think they are once saved,,once saved is a lie of satan<br>    we can not do as we please and go to Heaven,,they do not have<br>    the love of God in their heart,s  and that,s why they are gloomy<br>    look on their face,s..a true christian will Always,s have a smile<br>    and the love of God will show thur.|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	I think it's because they feel that they are trapped in a sea of drudgery.

I've spent a lot of time in Canada and I find Canadians are generally more relaxed and friendly than Americans.  And I think this has to do with crowding.

HYIR33G1aa	I have a son who is disabled and I have looked for 4 years to try and find a way to make a little money from home so that I can still provide care for him. The only things I have found are scams. There are several survey companies that really do pay, but its like $0.50 for 45 minutes of a survey and my time is worth a little more than that. One thing that i have found however is to call around to local real estate offices and other places like that and tell them about yourself and explain your situation a little bit. Then ask then if they would be willing to pay you to work on there mailings and other various paper work for your m=home. Many realtors send post cards out to let people know of a new listing and some will pay other people to put these together, label an stamp them and send them out. I hope that this helps some.

oxL8MEKPaa	Yes, I have. But ghosts. Instead they were either demons or, evil spirits. Iv'e seen them a few times, and so has my husband. they are real, but so is God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, and also God's Holy angels. <br>  A person does'nt have to been afraid of such evil spirits, as long as they have Jesus as their savior and Lord.<br>  <br>  Salvation<br>  There is no other name in all of heaven for people to call on to save them. – Acts 4:12 <br>  Meet Jesus now<br>  Jesus loves you very much and would love to come into your life right now. When you ask Him to come into your heart, He will forgive you of all your sin and give you a brand new life...a new beginning! You will be immediately become a child of God when you invite Him to take His place in your life. This is a miracle.<br>  If you are ready to receive Jesus as your personal Savior right now, then simply pray this prayer with sincere faith:<br>  Dear Jesus,<br>  I believe that You are the Son of God and that You died for me on the cross. I ask you to forgive me of all my sins and to come into my heart. I surrender my self to You and give you the reigns of my life. I receive You as my personal Savior and Lord. Thank You for writing my name in Your book of life.<br>  Amen <br>  God loves you with an everlasting love<br>  There is nothing better in life than knowing beyond any doubt that you are unconditionally and perfectly loved! Countless individuals spend their entire lives attempting to satisfy the cries of the empty and lonely places within - the places that long for the comfort and security that only love can provide.<br>  Where is such love and satisfaction found? Can you really experience that kind of security and well-being? Is it actually possible to understand the value of who you were created to be?<br>  There is no one like you. You were created as an object of His affection, acceptance, and love. It was never God's desire for you to experience rejection or abandonment; you were made to be a recipient of His bountiful grace and favor.<br>  May you drink deeply of this revelation and come to a full realization that....<br>  God Loves You with an Everlasting love!|`|rLrbEkamaa	Yep, a few times.

Each time I have tried to find a rational reason or tried to recreate whatever the experience was, most of the times I was unsuccessful. Of the many events, I have usually had someone with me at the time, so I know that I am not just imagining things unless of course they are imagining the exact same thing at the exact same time. I have been known to stand and have a complete conversation with a person, only to watch them totally dissipate in front of my eyes like smoke from a cigarette. Somewhat freaked by that is a polite way of expressing how I reacted. :-)   That one was one of my first major experiences with spirit and I have got much better at handling things in a calm and controlled manner since. Our most recent interaction is with the spirit of a cat - we have never owned one but there is one that wanders around our home following people from room to room and meowing at their feet. If this happened in just one room, I would say it was something in that room creating the noise, if this had only been experienced by one person I would say that they had imagined it however, it always happens when there is two or more people in the room and it happens in different rooms of the house. <br>  The events I have witnessed over the years are varied and many, and no matter how many people say that ghosts don't exist, I beg to differ. I'm a rational and logical person by nature and as I say I will do all I can to find a normal explanation for the things that happen - but sometimes there is no escaping the most likely reason was that it was caused by a visitor from another realm. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|sk46uigvaa	I agree with Albert,<br>   my late grandmother had a heart attack on the operating table and she swore that she saw herself being resuscitated she had had a lot of evidence to back it up as well!!,<br>  she was also visited by her mother one night in her bedroom, a few minutes after when Her mother would have died.<br>  <br>  My mother saw an Old fashioned bicycle in the bathroom when she was teenager, she went back out of the room and when she returned it wasn't there, the bike never even existed! strange but VERY true.|`|tYqUutidaa	At one house a little girl would sit on the staircase and watch my family play boardgames!<br>  <br>  I seen a ghost go through a door up in the ceiling then 2 weeks later it was walking on my bed, and hovering over atop of me he wasn't too nice.<br>  <br>  1 ghost taunted my wife she had to keep moving around, if she stopped anywhere he would appear in corners a 6ft dark shadow, I cursed him and seen it, we had to get Holy Water to get rid of the ghost.|`|VRHrppXRaa	My friend sees ghosts in his house all the time, several times a week, when he wakes up in the middle of the night.

The bldg. I worked in on a university campus was haunted.  When we'd come in in the morning we felt a welcoming presence.  I stayed late one night to work and I felt something cold behind me and the hair on the nape of my neck stood up and I felt that I should leave and leave RIGHT NOW!  And I did.  We kept all our old files downstairs and we called it the morgue.  We tried to keep the door locked but every morning it would be broken.  Sometimes we'd hear chairs moving around upstairs and think someone was up there but if we went to look there was no one there.  The phones would ring and no one would be on the phone.  The cleaning people did not like to go upstairs at night alone.  Their vacuum cleaner would keep coming unplugged and they didn't feel welcomed. One time when I was the last one to leave and it was getting late as I was going out the door I thought I heard my name whispered as I left.|`|GSwjoipVaa	I don't know if I have seen ghosts or if my eyes were playing pranks on me but I was home alone and I was walking past my hall and in the corner of my eye I  saw like a figure of a person walk into my brother's room.

The reason your not popular has nothing to do with your size.. When I was in high school I knew plenty of thick girls who were popular... and one of them was a cheerleader with me... The reason that your not popular is because it seems like your shy, you have to step out of your shell and show people the real you. People will then gravitate towards you because of your personality. You said your up to date on style and music so use that to your advantage and talk about that with other kids at your school... Or even join some clubs that your interested in... <br>  <br>  PS... always remember to love yourself NO MATTER what people think or say about you... hope this helps|`|2LqfVK1naa	To feel better about yourself, exercise, eat healthy, become normal Weight.

1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	12 year old girls watching anime constantly without subtitles thinking they can learn Japanese from it (LIES) and speaking Engrish and throwing random Japanese words into their sentences and driving all of us normal people who are interested in Japan and giving us a bad name?<br>  <br>  "OMG IT'S SUCH A KAWAII NEKO DESU!" (emphasize the "u" that's not supposed to be said by saying "desooooooo")<br>  <br>  But seriously, for the sane population that is interested in Japanese culture, a growing interest in the language, more people listening to Jpop and getting into Japanese street fashion (more just like Japanese punk and Lolita (NOT the English meaning of the word) styles. I wear casual loli occasionally and I have a Qi loli outfit, and I'm going to anime boston in a punk loli outfit). An increased interest in anime, which is fine, as long as it doesn't turn into an obsession (see above example). <br>  <br>  Compared to us having an impact on Japan, barely any influence. Though it's growing and more and more people are interested in it.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	I hate you asians why are you coming to America stay in your country

1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	You can live off of not eating meat, I grew up vegetarian (though from time to time I greatly enjoy chicken, hot dogs, bacon and some beef). <br>  <br>  However if you don't eat meat you HAVE to make sure you're getting the same nutrition you would, including the same vitamins and carbs, etc. Soymeat is great, and it (usually) tastes like it's meat counterpart. I personally love Tofu, people say it tastes gross, and I say "it doesn't have a taste raw". It's like water, but if you cook it with a food, it tastes like the food. Tofu is good for nutrition (and then that connects to the soy stuff). <br>  <br>  Now if you're a VEGAN, that's harder. Not a good idea (for me), I couldn't live with being a Vegan and I applaud those who are able to. Chances are you WON'T get the right diet and nutrition if you aren't a very careful eater as a Vegan to get all the vitamins and nutrients you need.<br>  <br>  It depends on WHAT you eat in the end, but if you're a vegetarian, it's still easy to have just the same amount of nutrition as people who eat meat.|`|pDmTRG82aa	same goes with parents enforcing religion on their kids. except that there are actual health benefits to eating meat.

The worst could happen is someone could actually self-examine and realize the nature of their own faith.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I regularly see questions from people who a clearly suffering as a result of the irrational religious beliefs, and there is always an abundance of answers from religious people encouraging them to stay on exactly the same destructive path that lead them to their current predicament.<br>  <br>  And there is no rebuttal to our damaging points, that's not how this game plays out.  You use fear and groupthink to convince people to believe what you want them to believe, we use logic and ridicule of your more absurd beliefs.  Ridicule works for you sometimes but logic is completely and wholly *our* weapon.|`|QKs0PFVpaa	i'm not trying to be nasty, but this should be deleted. its verging close to bullying. <br>  <br>  if everyone starts naming names, it could incite alot of nastyness. <br>  <br>  (and i would be saying the same thing if this was about christians)<br>  <br>  Sometimes is it hard to answer questions cos you just don't have an answer? too good a question?

I've never seen a Christian on here that has made me doubt for a moment that they were delusional.<br>  <br>  That's why I first started coming here.  I would ask Christians difficult questions, and their answers would display for everyone to see, just how illogical and often ignorant they are.  This is what people need to see.<br>  <br>  Your everyday Christian can appear to be quite normal and sane.  Only when you draw out the nature of their delusion can you expose just how wrong their cult is.<br>  <br>  I used to do this for the Muslims, also.  But the Muslims get your questions deleted immediately.  And I've learned from experience, that unlike Christians, they are well aware that their cult is indefensible.  They don't care.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	What answers?  All I see for the most part is the same responses over and over and they are a variation of these:<br>  <br>  "because he doesn't exist"<br>  "because it's all just a fairy tale and made up"<br>  "there is no god"<br>  "the bible is nothing but a fairy tale book and you shouldn't believe any of it"<br>  <br>  It demonstrates that the atheist isn't here to convince anyone God doesn't exist except to him/herself, and by repeating the same dull answers over and over he/she hopes to convince him/herself that He doesn't.
