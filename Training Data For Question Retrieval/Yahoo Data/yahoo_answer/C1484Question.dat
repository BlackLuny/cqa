This is just my opinion ,but surely if it were true that this was said ,then Jesus and God  if they existed forgave man for not believing. It says in the bible that the people were mocking Jesus for saying he had brought people back to life and had performed miracles, but he still forgave them or rather he asked God to forgive them, even though it's obvious they still didn't believe him.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are "endowed by their Creator" with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.      According to this statement from our Declaration of Independence, If you say there is no creator, how do you have any rights as an American.      We are created equal and are "endowed" by the creator with certain rights. Without this you cant have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Who is going to endow you this right if you dont believe in a creator?      I know I will get a lot of snarky remarks and emails. But thats ok.
20090223074355AAqWHR7	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Does Allah punish or reward Muslims who knowingly lie about Islam to defend and/or promote it?	I'm vaguely familiar with the concept of Islamic al-taqiyya ("covering or concealing") and I'm wondering if Allah promises rewards in paradise for those who blatantly deny certain truths about Islam, and intentionally misrepresent it for the sake of propaganda.      For example, one of the latest "scientific miracles" being advertised by Muslims worldwide is that the Qur'an describes the Earth as egg-shaped. This hoax has been exposed (dahaha refers to the spread out nest of an ostrich, not the ostrich egg) yet so many Muslims appear to either be completely unaware of this intentional mistranslation, or insist that it's true.      Based on that example, what will Allah have in store for those who fake scientific miracles and such for their obligatory attempts to proselytize innocently ignorant non-Muslims?

This indicates in the future we will have computers that will be able to decode a persons thoughts or have computers which will give us our thoughts and also this shows how easy are free will can be taken and I know will be taken in the future.   Today using this technology you can make a person move their limbs against their own will or control a robot device with your thought alone.       With all that I can see this becoming digital or using satellites to control humanity to do as the controller pleases ie slavery for economic purposes I can first see them programming the other great apes. Forget robots with minds better than ours we are the ones which will be under controll by software      Shouldnt we be scared its not like this will take 100 years the amount of data a computer chip can store is doubling every two years and we can already hold alot of data maybe by next century your whole life all your thought will be downloaded.

Christ did not know that the Crucifixion was "Good News for Mankind," but had to be zapped by the Holy Spirit 50 days later to become as "smart" as today's believers.      Here is the question: WHERE do you see the Apostles being told by the Holy Spirit that the Crucifixion was "Good News for Mankind?"      I am asking this question because I notice that neither Christ, nor his Apostles were broadcasting any such message... a message that only came out when the one who terrorized the first Christians (Paul/Saul) said "Christ died for our sins" in his letters.      That was neither the public message of Christ and could not have been the message of the real apostles, since I am told that they didn't even know it!      Something is off here... very off.      So WHERE do you see the Apostles being told by the Holy Spirit that the Crucifixion was "Good News for Mankind?"

I mean, I like him.  He's gentlemanly, won't let me pay if I take him out.  We seem to have a lot in common.  Anyway, here's a list of things that kind of...bother me.      I'm becoming reluctant to hang out with him, because he's constantly trying to kiss me.  A few times is ok, but if we're at the movies, if we're on a date, or if we're just hanging out talking, it's like he *needs* to be kissing me every 5 minutes.  We've been dating about 2 weeks now.      We were just talking, and we were like 2 or 3 feet apart, and he asks why I'm so far away.  Literally 90% of the time, he wants his arms around me.  Which is nice...in moderation.        When he does start kissing me, if I gently push him to break the kiss, he sometimes doesn't respond.      He said he planned to see me today.  But this is how he asked: "I'll be outside your house at 10:30.  Ok?"  I really didn't like that, and just canceled on him because I have much studying to do.  Anyway, what do you think?

The two keep running into each other, and Tierra ignores her every time 'cuz she's shy and doesn't want to like girls, and she heard Meg has a gf.       Meg talks about her (obnoxiously) to everyone, tries to get Ti's attention in drastic ways...eventually shows up in places she knows Ti will be--and sometimes brings her friends w/ her. When Ti continues to ignore her, Meg gets pissed off and so do her friends...but, Meg, of course still tries to get in Ti's face anyway...      What the heck? Can someone make sense of this?

20090223084945AADqV1t	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Do the Raafidis believes that Prophet Muhammad was unjust and unfair?	I asked this :  http://ans*wers.yahoo.com/question/index...    and i got no answer to my question from Raafidi side.    _____________________      One Raafidi said Fadak was a gift from Prophet ( peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) to Faatimah ( peace be upon her).      We see Hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim :      Sahaabi Bashir ibn Sa‘d ( peace be upon him) came to Prophet ( peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him), telling him that he had given one of his sons a garden as a gift, and requesting Prophet ( peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) to be witness thereto.       Prophet ( peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) asked whether he had given a similar gift to all of his children. When he replied in that he had not in fact done so,Prophet ( peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) told him,       “Go away, for I will not be a witness to injustice.”    ________________________      When he prohibited the act of giving one child more than the others ,       Is it then at all plausible that one such as he, as an infallible Prophet who refuses to be witness to injustice, would himself perpetrate that injustice by giving it to Faatimah ( peace be upon her ) only ?      Is it like he preach other for Justice and he himself do injustice ?   ________________________      Moreover , we do not see Faatimah ( peace be upon her) requested  Fadak as Gift but she requested it as a Inheritance.      plus , why didn't Imaam `Ali(peace be upon him)  treated Fadak as the estate of his deceased wife Faatimah (peace be upon her), by taking a quarter for himself and distributing the remaining three quarters between Al-Husayn(peace be upon him) and Umm Kulthum(peace be upon her) during his caliphate ?      Also , Why did Faatimah ( peace be upon her) went to Imaam Abu Bakr ( peace be upon him) requesting the Fadak  as a Inheritance, If it was her gift , isn't it supposed to be with her control, ?       Why didn't Imaam `Ali(peace be upon him) worked to get his wife right back ? and Why did she requested it as a Inheritance if it was her property ?    ___________________________

20090223083855AAkBrKG	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it OK to stiff a cab driver on the tip if he talks on his cell phone the whole way?	Because that's my new policy.    I used to drive a cab in my college days, and I did well on tips because I actually engaged my fares in conversation.   I asked them what radio station they'd like to listen to, let them smoke, anything they wanted.         Nowadays, I get in the cab and the guy's talking on his phone even while I'm telling him where I want to go.   I find it unbelievably rude for the driver to be on the phone the whole time - a short call here or there, fine, but when I have to hear the guy just shooting the breeze in Hindi for 45 minutes, I actually consider running out on the whole fare, let alone the tip.      So am I being too harsh?

20090223084844AACq2ij	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do you handle fake, diplomatic people who you don't like?	You know the kind of guys who are cunning, and selfish on the inside, but play it cool with everyone on the outside, just so they can get things from others and use them/take advantage of them. And all thanks to their...charisma/diplomacy?      My question is, is it alright to say NO to them when they ask you for something? Coz I hate those kind of pretentious people.      Here's an example. A guy with the above description asked if he could borrow my CDs and stuff. I said "no sorry". Then he went around spreading that I am stingy and stuff. But If I need something from him, he will pretend to be really busy and engaged, and will never use the word "no" but will lie and cover up in a diplomatic fashion. But I like to be straight forward. So when I tell him 'no', because everyone thinks he's friendly/cool and don't see through him, they easily listen with all ears open when he brands me for being stingy. And note, I know he's being saying i'm stingy because people have come and asked me eg. "i heard from ___ that you're stingy. why didn't you lend him __?"      So am I supposed to give these types of jerks whatever they want or can I say no to them?

I'm trying to figure out something to give up for Lent that would be a challenge, but also something from which I'm certain I can abstain.  The problem is that health and financial concerns have already taken most of my vices from me.      I don't eat any sweets nor do I drink soda because I may be prediabetic.  I don't eat meats, dairy products, or eggs nor do I drink milk because I've been vegan for nine years.  I broke my caffeine addiction nearly a year ago, and altho' I still want to drink alcohol, I can't anymore because of my medication.  I've never smoked.      I rarely eat potato chips, mixed nuts, or popcorn anymore because I can no longer afford the extra grocery expense.  I own a television, but I never use it because I can't afford cable or satelite.      I won't give up internet because I use it to pay bills, communicate, and search for employment.

What else does he have to say about the LGBT community?   -"I believe they will destroy the foundation of the American society"   -"What is the morals of a gay person? You can't answer that, because anything goes. So now you're moving toward a society that has no morals."   -Buttars called homosexuality "a perversion" and took credit for killing every gay-rights bill that has come before the Senate over the last eight years.

20090223085613AA98mQv	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	How many muslims want to burn in hell forever for not knowing sharia laws?	verse 5:44 allah declares that whoever does not want to abide by allah's law,sharia, will burn in hell. also in suras 5:47  45:18   45:22.    sharia law forbids muslims to wear the pant legs below their ankles or socks above them under punishment of hell forever; bukhari book 72 #678;  bukhari book 48 hadith 48.5.12 bukhari 5787 bukhari 5784 muslim 2085 to name just a few ; there are three people that allah will not speak to on judgement day, will not look at them, will not purify them and for them is a painful punishment [hell]; one who let's his garment hang below his ankles. see also muslim #106 and 1/102. so why haven't muslims been told about this sin. muslims need to learn sharia law and why do so few in the west know them?

Now before you send me answers like, "why is this in the LGBT section". I will have you know that, 1.) I'm a lesbian, so we are family! 2.) I think that us LGBTs are more creative people.      My question is; I have organized an anti-bullying campaign at my school. I have designed some boxes to go in various places around the school for the kids to report bullying without having to report in-person. So what would be a cool name i could put on the boxes. I cant call them snitch boxes or something ridiculous like that, so whats a good name people?

20090223085609AAIW9vr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	So have any of you tried the New Purina Diet?	I'm sure that many of you have already seen this diet. But I just received it in e-mail. I was wondering any one hear of it?         New Purina Diet   Since I'm retired, I have to think of things to do.....Yesterday I was at Wal-Mart buying a large bag of Purina cat chow for my loyal pet Molly and was in the checkout line when woman behind me asked if I had a cat.What did she think I had, an elephant? So since I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a cat, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms. I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina   nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.) Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the cat food poisoned me. I told her no;    I stepped off a curb to sniff another cat's butt and a car hit us both.      I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard. Wal-Mart won't let me shop there anymore.    Better watch what you ask retired people. We have all the time in the world to think of crazy things to say.   How about that diet?

I'm an athlete because I am dumb. My IQ is 87. That is pretty dumb to me. When I am not trying to be a fool or a goof ball I still manage to be one. When I am trying to be serious I still manage to do idiot things. Life in society today doesnt seem like the thing that appeals to me because I dont want to be the average prep anymore. I want to be myself and be an open book about life but people tend to resent me for that. They also tend to resent me for my actions. I like to think of life as a plain line that is to short; I need to add a bunch of decorations and things into it in order to make it fun. Is that so bad? does that really make me an annoiying idiot? And why cant I do good in academics? its like I study, and study, and study but I fail at every test I take. Do I have mental retardation?

What can we do, we're all sick and tired of the mindless chatter.  I've tried listening to the radio, she drowns it out.

I mean there are not many of us... we are basically outnumbered by the population in wheelchairs. So I kind of understand why we get judged so much ... we are really different. Although, everything has been made handicap accessible, so I am down to be accommodated as well. But the whole idea of being gay is just weird to me. Why would I be attracted to what I already have? I have a penis ... yet I want more penis. haha it just seems so dumb. Its like a birth defect... but one that isn't too hard to cope with and isn't obvious by appearance. If its nature's intention to make all things to reproduce, then what in the world are we doing here? And don't say we can still reproduce... because although that is true, we are going to choose not to. Unless artificially. But thats artificial. My theory is that maybe we are more evolved... the human race has naturally through time realized that we are overpopulating -- out numbering our resources -- and has decided to harmlessly decrease our population through making a gay race. So we are just more evolved than all those crazy christians. But seriously... the whole idea of being gay is weird to me. And we all tend to be so self righteous... jumping on who ever criticizes or questions us. That really annoys me. It makes sense for people not to understand. They are after all the norm, only trying to comprehend the strange. I'm completely comfortable with it and have a great time being gay... but its weird, and Im ok with that too.

20090223085718AARaLTQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The evolution of man's thought, Does the "no-osphere" exist?	I went off on a bit of a tangent in my reply to a question a few minutes ago by someone asking; What we thought our evolved species would look like in the future. It got me thinking about a book I had to read three times before still not understanding it. If you've read it I'd love to hear your thoughts,  if not that's cool too.         Your Answer:   Interesting to me is how this question relates not so much to our physical evolution within our species, ie; bigger/smaller teeth, ears or even brians for that matter. The larger more interesting question to me is; how or will the history of human information and thought continue to evolve? Teillard I believe coined the term "no-osphere" . That as the rational creature evolves, humanity's combined thought over time also evolves and encompasses the planet, not unlike the biosphere. He wrote around the time when planes, trains and automobiles just started to exist and pined for a time that man would reach his "Omega point" of thought.  Which of course would be the consumation of all thought and knowledge in being..."God."       I wonder what the good "Pere" would have to say about the age of information/misinformation, the internet, and how the evolved species of man and his thought in present day globalization. Have we or have we not drawn closer to this "Christogenesis" of man? In the time that has passed since this paleo-anthropologist, gone de-frocked, yet regardless remained devout, Catholic priest wrote, is man any "closer" to God?      Note; Theillard was an interesting thinker IMO but don't search his works for profound metaphysics, apparently when the vatican asked their own experts to study it, Etienne Gilson reported back he could not make a metaphysical study of art.       Peace; Dear dogma   Source(s):   I can't remember the "Etienne Gilson" quote source but believe it valid.      "The Phenomenon of man" Pere Theillard de Chardin

In my opinion that would make us both agnostics or agnostic/athiest      Would two people like that be allowed to get married?

I know I'm only 13 and I could still have a lot of time to think about this kind of thing, but who knows? The world could end tomorrow, or in a month.   I really want to follow Jesus and be a better person, but I've been sucking at that lately. I just feel like there's no hope, if I can't even stop all this sinning. I know God forgives sins, but if I keep doing it over and over and over again until I die I would probably go to Hell, right? I can't even imagine Hell right now. I don't even want to think about it...   I want to spend eternity with Jesus... but I just don't think it's possible right now. I'm terrible at this.   My brother swears a lot, and I'm afraid I'm starting to get that habbit too... which is awful, I know, but I always think swears words when I'm mad, and I'm afraid it'll actually start slipping through my lips, too. I do NOT want to start happening! Ugh... I really am doomed if I don't get help.      I really need some help right now. Advice... please...

I went to one that the History Channel showed once, and it was appalling to actually read first-hand what these people think. I mean, what they really, truly believe! It's ridiculous.

According to the NPR article below: "In 2006, Hagen was the liaison between the main Justice Department and the U.S. Attorneys' committee on Native American affairs. The chairman of that committee, Tom Heffelfinger, described Hagen to NPR last year as "the best qualified person in the nation to fill that job." Hagen's performance evaluations had the highest possible ratings — "outstanding" in each of five categories.      The job came up for renewal every year. After the first year, Hagen was surprised to hear that she would have to move on.       As NPR reported in April, a top aide to the attorney general had heard a rumor that Hagen was a lesbian. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is against Justice Department rules. But Monica Goodling, senior counsel to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, had Hagen removed from her job anyway. Goodling continued to block attempts of Hagen to get another job with the Justice Department that she was qualified for."      After being rehired recently, NPR reports:   "It is not a perfectly happy ending for Hagen. Nobody official from the department ever apologized to her for what happened. She still owes thousands of dollars in attorney fees, and the Justice Department has refused to pay those bills."      NPR article titled: "Justice Rehires Attorney Fired Amid Gay Rumor":    http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story...       Ah American Justice..the irony of our US Justice system..so do you think the Bush Admin was right in firing Hagen because of gay rumors, even though she was a perfect fit for the job? Why or why not?

They say that those religious people got tired because there has been no signs of condemnation or anything from god, and thus, they thought, they are going to make sure that god's condemnation to the sinners works by purposely releasing several strands of virus.

Have you ever felt as much love from a person, as you do from Jesus.      If you can, try to explain any differences in love that you experience.   Also, is the love the same general emotion with regards of what you feel towards and from people or would you explain it as a completely different emotion?

20090223100455AAr0FMs	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do whites think racism is over?	I hear a lot of white people say that blacks should get over slavery because that happened over 100 years ago. How come they don't realize that there were laws created for another 100 years that segregated blacks from whites and prevented blacks from gaining an education, employment, transportation, and housing. After slavery ended blacks had no education because they were prevented from reading and writing by slave owners. So the only work they could do was work for former slave owners the only difference is that the former slave owners had to pay their former slaves money for work rendered. Then out of the blue The Jim Crow Laws were created because they thought is wasn't fair for blacks to live and have the same rights as whites. Blacks had to create businesses for themselves, create educational institutions for themselves, and etc. They didn't have enough money to get the best supplies, books, and tools to teach students. They had to learn from old, used books. In addition to this you had the KKK running rampant burning houses, crosses, hanging and killing blacks because they felt they deserve more rights than blacks. This went on for another 100 years until Martin Luther King fought for our right to end segregation and allow us to vote and have the same rights as whites. Then after all this blacks still had issues to overcome from our past. Do you think all white people all of a sudden decided in their minds that blacks deserved the same rights as them? No. And there are still whites to this day that feel blacks could never be equal to them. They still feel that we are less than humans, matter of fact they think we are monkeys, apes and gorillas. My boyfriend had to deal with a little racism in school. When he was one of the students with the highest SAT score he had a teacher comment on how could that happen since black people are not smart enough to receive high SAT scores. And he also had a counselor tell him not to take a Biology class because since he is black he can't pass the class, and guess what, he did. And after he received his bachelor's degree had to deal with racial profiling. So whether a black man is educated or not he is going to suffer through racial profiling.      I need to know how can you possibly think racism is over? It's going to take a few decades for the mind sets of individuals to change and accept us.

A Jewish friend was recently told by a Fundamentalist Christian that he was going to hell. It upset me. I am Roman Catholic. The Church teaches that we cannot know who is in hell. We know it exists, but only God can determine the state of a person’s soul. We also reject the theology of “Assurance of Salvation” In my opinion; it is presumptuous to assume that one is destined for heaven. I believe it violates free will. God wants us to come to him freely. The theology of “assurance of salvation” seems like blackmailing God; “I said these words so you HAVE to let me in heaven. What are your thoughts?
20090223094101AAklBda	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do Jews realize their importance to Christianity?	One of my Jewish friends is having a crisis of faith. In Catholicism, we call this the dark night of the soul"; when God seems absent. I assured him of God’s love and encouraged him to practice his faith. His wife is from an Orthodox family. I saw a beautiful photo of her dear relatives that perished in the Holocaust.  I refuse to believe they died in vain. Do Jews realize that if they lose faith; it hurts Christians? They are our elder brothers and sisters. A Jewish atheist is a contradiction!

I've come across so many versions of the Maori Wars that I've started asking opinions on the war for further research. Most real scholars will say the Maori won the wars, in fact the in 1835 there was signed a Declaration of Independence, 5 years later, there was signed the Treaty of Waitangi from which 2 versions were made. there have been over 2 Billion dollars in settlement over these Treaty mixups, cause in 1910 the Maori hit a huge population drop from the 1910 Influenza, and some took advantage    The Maori Pa has been talked about in the NZETC, but that is a "FREE" online database put up by the Victorian University, supporting "British" Authors after the wars were long over. Thats like asking the Maori and New Settler's (kiwi people) enemy, who do you think kicked the most butt?- The Pa on the Q&A on one persons page said, the Maori Pa was just a volcano compound of rock...I would like to know if "you" know what the Maori Pa was and how effective it was in winning against the British Imperials.

20090223100711AA85Wyc	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How can I not make people feel uncomfortable?	I'm a college senior and I am very unhappy because I am struggling in several different areas of my social life, they are:      1. My best friend said we are suddenly in "different seasons" of life after I told her I was still attracted to her (even though she says the two are unrelated).         2. It's been 6 months since all of this transpired with my friend, and I still have not been able to find new person/group of people to connect with and hang out with like she and I did. I go to places (my friend suggested I go to church groups because she is really in to religion) like youth groups and on campus groups, and it seems like people acknowledge me and say "hi" only because it is polite to do so. Historically when I see those people outside of the event on campus or around town, they seem hesitant to talk to me or be seen with me, which actually hurts.          3.I often perceive others as feeling uncomfortable around me because I do not do things in the way they might expect me too...(i.e. my style of dress, the manner in which I speak, my outlook on life are all different from most girls in the local culture) I'm black but I talk and act "white" which apparently weirds people out in itself. I'm a girl over 6 feet tall and I generally shop in the men's department at Abercrombie & Fitch, and wear boxers,-people regard that as strange too. I use big words and know most answers in class...which people think is even weirder.      4. I am 23 and have never been in a relationship, although I want to be. All of the girls I am attracted to seem to be flirtatious with me, but when I tell them how I feel, they deny it and say that they do not like me and are only into guys. I have trouble understanding that a girl "just a friend" when she is touching me all over and putting her hands in my front jean pocket and rubbing, making long unexplained eye contact,  or wants to make out in her dorm and later says they are either dating someone...or not into me. I mean...how can I tell if someone is legitimate-especially I have never been in a relationship and do not know what to look for?         5. Because of the fact that I am no longer as close as I once was with my best friend, and I that I am having such difficulty making new friends, I have begun to dislike myself to the point of considering harming myself or ending my life. It kinda bothers me to walk around the mall and have people just openly laugh at me. It bothers me to walk around campus and try to make eye contact with others only get a bad face made at me. It feels awkward when I sit down with a group of people in an attempt to socialize, and they all get up and move to another table...I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea. I'm beginning to think that I am the problem and that no matter how nice I am, how hard I try, or how many counselors I seek advice from, It never seems to improve- even after 10 years of being a "reject".      Further, When I talk to these adults who over 40 they say they don't see anything wrong with me, and our interactions are never strange. So I feel it must be  something to do with my interactions with my peers. Not that his is anything new, I mean, I never had many friends all through the 13 elementary, middle, and high schools I attended (I was in foster care) but right now this is of particular concern to me because soon I will graduate and either get a job in the real world or go on to law school....I know that with most people...you typically are the person you are going to be forever by the time you reach age 17 or so. I do not wish to be perceived as friendless , creepy, and too desperate for a relationship and positive approval/attention once I am older in life, or even worse,I do not want to  end up taking my life before I even get much older.      I know you all are not therapists, I am seeing one right now and have been since sixth grade, but since they are usually unable to pinpoint my social difficulties because they are not there in a school environment, i've figured I seek advice amongst my peers, usually a lot of college and high school aged young adults use yahoo answers and might be able to help if they know someone like me or is often unfairly teased, or labeled as creepy or awkward. thx.

20090223100151AAjNZGy	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How do I know if he is gay?	I just met this guy. He is really smart, funny, and we have things in common. Great! My only concern is that I think he might be gay or bi because of the way he dresses, talks as well as some body movements. I'm black and so is he and usually black gay men are very obvious....sorry if I am offending anyone, but I can always tell! But, in this case, I can't. Although the signs are all there, he is very much showing interest in me in a more-than-friends kinda way. I am confused and not sure what someone would do to clarify what the truth is without offending him. Any thoughts on how to get to the truth? My thought is, is it possible that he is on the down low and just dating women for cover up? Please help!!!!!

20090223065038AAcCxcP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do we give Buddhism a free pass?	Now before you read and respond please stay classy/polite and articulate in your answers! Regardless of whether a person is a brilliant agnostic or fundamental (something or other), one major thing I can't stand and has been driving down the site, regardless of beliefs is tasteless answers and rudeness.      Now back to the question:   I have family who live in a mostly Buddhist country so if anything I'm picking on my "own" culture but I notice that many times the government (who declared the official religion Buddhism) builds shiny new & amazingly expensive temples and shrines made of gold, silver, jade, marble, and rare antique wood when that money could instead be definitely going towards more effective and proven uses like building better hospitals, safer roads, and a nicer health care system based on modern science and not building large shrines so that the Buddhist religion in the nation can gain even bigger donations based on somewhat obsolete sayings of what a smart but ancient ascetic said more than 2500 years ago.      Now I'm not trying to pick on Buddhism too much because I agree that the religions such as this one aren't as destructive to humanity's progress and rational proven science as Christianity and Islam were and continue to be but that doesn't mean that we should put them on the same plane as rational thought.      I plan to possibly address this question if Richard Dawkins starts an audience Q & A session when he comes to our college so once again please if you respond be classy and articulate!

I went to this McDonalds to get a bite to eat, and I also knew they nice girls there. SO , I  went out of the way, but I have been there before, and I noticed something that I thought may be discrimination. This area is multi cultural , whites, blacks, and hispanic. It is also next to a college. Ayhow, I noticed there was like 20 plus Hispanics working there and no other race of people. I am sure that there must have been some other peoples to apply for the job there, and i am sure they might have turned them down. Well, I only thought of this because when I went to apply for a job at a Burger King several years ago, it was only Mexican peoples and in a mostly black area, they told me I needed to speak spanish, much to their surprise I was fluent in the language , so they told me to fill out the app and I still didn't get a job, they never called me.

Hebrew Chapter 4       Hbr 4:1   Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.       Hbr 4:2  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].       Hbr 4:3  For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.       Hbr 4:4  For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.       Hbr 4:5  And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.       Hbr 4:6  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:       Hbr 4:7  Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.        Hbr 4:8  For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.       Hbr 4:9  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.       Hbr 4:10  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.       Hbr 4:11  Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.       Hbr 4:12  For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.       Hbr 4:13  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.       Hbr 4:14  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.       Hbr 4:15  For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.       Hbr 4:16  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.   ***   Luk 6:5    And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.    ***   Is the verse below talking about those who do keep the sabbaths?      Col 2:16   Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:   ***   Here we read that strangers who join themselves to the LORD are to keep the sabbath from polluting it?      Isa 56:1   Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation [is] near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.       Isa 56:2  Blessed [is] the man [that] doeth this, and the son of man [that] layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.       Isa 56:3  Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I [am] a dry tree.      Isa 56:4   For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose [the things] that please me, and take hold of my covenant;       Isa 56:5  Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.      Isa 56:6   Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;       Isa 56:7  Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices [shall be] accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.       Isa 56:8  The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather [others] to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.

The brother says he wants to finish his studies first then marry you and he really wants you to wait for him. So what do you do?

He already knows what's going to happen, so why would it be considered us making a choice...he already know what we are going to do!  He wouldn't be an all knowing God if he didn't know what we were going to choose.  So how does freedom of choice work?  Wouldn't he already know if we were "saved" or not if he was truly an all knowing God?

So why not give it a try?

For they are not all Israel who are of Israel, 7 nor are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, “In Isaac your seed shall be called.”      So why do we have to be for Israel is Paul says that not every in Israel is of Israel and not everyone who is a son of Abraham is part of Israel?

Wouldn't it make much more sense to make a reasonable approximation of your conception date (given that it's usually impossible to pinpoint the exact date) and celebrate that?  After all, if that's what you believe, then the day your life began should be MUCH more significant than the day you started breathing air.      I'm not trolling, I'm really curious - I've never heard of anyone celebrating their conception day before, and it seems odd to me.

As a form of criticism, someone posted the following from teh Catechism:      Paragraph 868: The Church is catholic: she proclaims the fullness of the faith. She bears in herself and administers the totality of the means of salvation.      Why didn't this person also post the following:      Paragraph 819:   "Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of truth" are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic Church: "the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope, and charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements." Christ's Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial communities as means of salvation, whose power derives from the fullness of grace and truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church.

I recently found out that the pastor of the small country church I attend is taking financial advantage of an elderly church member lady he is supposed to be helping.  He over sees her land and cows farm etc and unnecessarily gets her to buy stuff he doesn't need, like himself a  new truck for himself.  He also got her to pay off a debt to keep the guy who helps him stay out of jail.  Everyone thinks he is so great and so did I but now I am heartbroken that even though I guess if she knows about the spending it's not stealing but he is taking advantage. My children love Sunday school here and we love the other members.  Can I get past this feeling about the pastor or find a new church?

While my mom and dad are both religious, my dad is VERY religious, while my mom is a little bit more understanding.  I am married and have a little girl, and my husband is athiest.  I believe in God, and consider myself spiritual, but I do not attend church.  I probably would attend church, but my husband is very against religion and I really don't want to rock the boat.  My dad has made a few comments about how he feels like we should go to chuch and all of that and I have not said anything to him about my husbands views.  I don't want him to think of my husband any different.  He really likes him and I don't want that to change.  My mom knows how my husband feels about religion and doesn't care at all....she doesn't ever mention it.  Now I feel really strange because my dad just brought it up again that my daughter should go to sunday school.  My sister and her husband are "looking at churches" and he thinks I should too.  I feel kind of bad that I want to be part of the group, but now what my husband says about organized religion coming true.  It's more about social acceptance by a peer group than doing it for the right reason....would I really feel the same way if I knew my dad wouldn't care if I attended church or not?  I don't know how to talk to my dad about this....he has come down on one of my sisters ex boyfriends because he was a non-believer.  I don't want him to do that to my husband.

20090223084053AAPqWRu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why blame an entire religion for the actions of a few?	So many claim to be victims because of religious suppression, however most of these cases tend to turn out to be caused by a radical group (name a race, religion, ect and you'll have extremists), parents (their parents forced them to believe their religion as a child and they still have issues about that), or a random encounter with someone who thinks because they are part of a religion they are better than ones who don't believe.        So instead of just putting the blame into these individuals people will blame the entire religion itself, so I have to ask why?        I mean, you don't judge an entire race or country because the actions of a few.  So why do so many judge entire religions for the actions of a few?
20090223082518AA4mEha	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why would a loving God create the candiru?	"This fish is also known to attack humans and animals and swim into an orifice (the urethra, anus, or vagina). Because of spines protruding from the fish, it is almost impossible to remove except through surgery. Though there have been documented candiru attacks on humans, there is no evidence the fish can survive once inside a human. The danger for the person lies more in the infection and shock that results from having the organism lodged in sensitive tissues for an extended period of time than from physical damage done by the actual fish itself."      Basically, this creature seeks to claw its way up the very sensitive urethra or vagina or anal openings and tries to make itself at home.  For males in particular the surgery and complications can be pretty traumatic.      Why would God create such an abomination, which could conceivably cause great harm to an innocent person choosing to urinate in the Amazon river?

A few days later I was at his house and I was really tired.  He's really touchy feely and is constantly pulling me towards him to kiss him or whatever.  But that night when he pulled me toward him (we were standing) and I had made a joke about that night when I chickened out.  He reached down and groped me...down there.  I slapped his hand away, and he reached and did it again!  And I slapped him away again!  Told him to stop.  A few minutes later, I said "we're supposed to be getting to know each other, you don't do that when you're getting to know someone."  He then said "I didn't do that."  And reached in AGAIN!  I swatted his hand AGAIN and after that asked to be taken home.      I was really angry about it, and felt really uncomfortable.  But I also feel like I may have given him the wrong message with that whole situation where I chickened out, and the joke I made about it.  What do you think?  We've explored the idea of dating since I met him about 3 months ago.  But we've only really been dating for like 2.5 weeks.

20090223064657AAhO4yP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think gods of different religions are somehow interrelated or are the one and the same being?	There are so many religions in the world all worshipping different gods. Each religion having miracles of their own. Yeah I know some are hoaxes. But not all are. I for one who am a Christian have experienced miracles myself. I won't bother going into detail. I have no reason to lie. Skeptics can believe it or not if they want. I'm sure some of you guys out there from different religions also experienced some sort of miracle from your respective religions. Stuff that is completely impossible to do with sleight of hand or other means. So if there are miracles. It obviously means that there is something divine up above. Does that mean that up there in heaven has all the different gods of every single religion up there creating miracles? Or does that mean that all the religions in actual fact are actually praying to the one and the same god? One same entity/entities in the cosmos creating miracles for every religion. Maybe its just that each religion portray god/gods differently with different stories so we all think we are praying to different gods. What do you think?
20090223060220AAcLmVS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My question is about ghosts. Please dont take my question as a stupid question. Thank you?	heres what I have to say. There are people who have a 6th sense. But for me, it is completely different. I do have a 6th sense but not with eyes but with my ears. I hear the ghost but i never see them. The only time I see a ghost is when my mind is clear or when I am stress free or just relaxed. I dont know how I do it but I just see them. Its either a shadow of the ghost or the ghost itself but it stays there for like 10 seconds then itz gone. It does scare me but I just get used to it. I do get feelings that someone is beside me or looking at me when no one is there. But the most confusing one is that I can hear them but dont see them. When hearing them, its either they're talking in a whispery voice or if their walking around making noise. Trust me, there are times that ghosts actually visit me, and Ive had more than 7-10 experiences with ghosts. There is one night that a devil or bad spirit came to visit me at like 2:00-3:00 in the morning. Shook my bed(that's why I woke up) and almost I mean almost walked up my stairs becuz he took a big noise step up the stairs. But i only heard it. SO my question is. What is it called if you can only hear ghosts but sometimes see them but can feel them too? But mostly hearing? I know it sounds stupid of what I said but at least i'm not the only one :)

20090223090459AAKkEsa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My Christian controlling mother?	I know I'm almost 24 yrs old and shouldn't not let her bother me. But she does. I do not currently live at home and I will be moving back for two months before I leave for graduate school. I have been dating this wonderful guy she's met only once and refuses to believe I'm dating. She even goes to the extreme of not allowing me to bring him up in conversation. She downright scares me sometimes because she comes off so strongly and opinionated       Anyway I was talking with her today (I try to only talk to her once a week because after talking to her my whole day usually gets shot to pieces). I was telling her she needs to allow my 19 yr old brother to make his own mistakes in college and that she should trust him in the way she raised him (meaning us). My brother is a good boy, and I try to act as the middle man between her and my mom (kinda wish I had an older sibling that could have done the same).       Well she began telling me that my brother and I were still under her jurisdiction and will be until we get married. That being 19 and 23 didn't mean anything because we're still her children. I told her I am old enough to think and decide for myself. But she said I am not old enough to know everything. She dumbfounds me sometimes I don't even know how to take it.       My mom is the type of person, who to me personally comes on to strongly. She's a Christian. A concervative one. I am also, but not to her extreme. She almost makes me not want to go to Church or believe in God because I used to feel he got me into trouble with my mother when I was younger (like when God told her where to find my diary).       This conversation upset me. I love them a lot. I want to honor and obey them, but I don't agree with her. And when I voice everything she just says its in the Bible (the thing about being under her authority till I am married).       Is there anyone out there that know what verses she is talking about? Also, how they apply to life now days anyway. Such as verses countering this control? Any kind of advice is appreciated. I've tried talking to her and making her listen .... no such luck. I'll always be wrong.

Instead of having a crush on the hottest guy in class, i always liked the cute girls or though about them. i feel more comfortable with both guys and girls, just like girls more than guys. i've even dated a few guys and things just did not work out. i did not feel like i was connected at all. i mean, i feel more liking a girl than being with a guy. (make sense?) well, anyways, my family are very conservative christians, or at least they try to be, and i know that they frown at homosexuality. My older brother, my best Friend is even homophobic and will not accept this. my mother i'm not too sure because she has asked me before because of something i would say, but i would answer no and things would go back to normal. my younger sister, my other best friend, is probably the only person who know it for sure in a sense. My father i really do not know how he will react since we never had that conversation. i need help. i really do. should i confess now, since my family is going through a hard time or what? i mean, i have to confess sometimes. should it be now or never?      need any follow up, just tell me.

20090223105907AADefLn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality. And look at male-female relations. With all the complaints of "political correctness" walk into any college fraternity or bar and cavemen ethics still rule.      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.       So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

20090223111149AAmTA6W	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Resenting watching this girl's children?	Okay, I will try to make a long story short. I have a small home daycare. A girl who goes to my church and is married to the pastor's son who happens to be my husband's friend asked me to watch her child. I have learned over time that this girl is quite selfish, manipulative, and the world revolves around her. Its been one pain after another. I am a pushover and a people pleaser. Its not a good combination. I am watching her 2 children at half the rate of the other children. This happened because initially, her one child was coming for a very short day. She told me she was pregnant and asked if I could save a spot for the future baby. I didn't mind since I didnt' watch too many children. Anyways, I am now watching her 2 children for the price of one and they are coming long days, but only coming every other week (She is working full time now, 4 12 hour days, and one 16 hour day, and then 5 days off). So, she is working full time with benefits, and basically paying a quarter of what the other parents pay per child a month. She's also a picky parent, and has a lot of requests, complaints, etc. I have had to stand up to her a few times and draw the line, but I still resent watching her children. I feel sort of trapped because I agreed to do this on these terms. If it was some stranger, I would easily write up some new terms, etc. Now, they are going through a lot, her husband had mono, and a liver problem and ended up in the hospital, and she is struggling to make it at the moment. She dropped off the kids to me today on her week off so she could run errands and I'm just full of anger. I had looked forward to having a break this week. What is a healthy way to get rid of this anger, and get some control without totally going off on people who are going through a bad time!

20090223111800AAdLWtu	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	Should the drinking age be lowered to 18?	There was an interesting segment on "60 Minutes" last night.   MADD was the influential force to have the age raised to 21 in the 80's and indeed, traffic fatalities were reduced. But today, statistics show an increase in non traffic fatalities among 18-20 yr old drinkers.   The Boulder Col. chief-of-police claims that the police are being used inefficiently responding to underage drinking ... trying to enforce unenforceable laws.    Your thoughts please.   It was also suggested that 18-20 yr. olds be required to qualify for a drinking license that could be revoked when they display irresponsibility ... but, at least they would be exposed to the education before they could drink legally.

This really makes me sad and upset because I even work at my full time job for a bureau of equal employment opportunity which focuses on diversity in employment. Step up and respect all hard working people. This is rude and truly unacceptable for any respectable person.  I know this doesn't have anything to do with my service becuase i have 10 years experience and have never been treated like this before!

20090223110829AAv6bzC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can you theists subscribe to a young earth hypothesis?	How can you say the earth is only 6 thousand years old or so, when many different types of isotope dating shows that the planet is at least a billion years old.  And no, I am not talking about carbon dating, anyone with half a brain knows that carbon dating can only go back about 30,000 years.  I am talking about isotope dating with elements that have much longer half lifes.  How can you just blindly ignore so much hard scientific data and hang onto a concept with more holes in it than the tooth fairy?  Even if you say that a day for god equal 1000 years that would still make the earth only 70,000 years old in your mind.  The decay rate of radioactive isotopes is a reliable method of measure, a scientific hard fact.

Wasn't that at the time that if you questioned the Church you were killed? So why didn't they kill Martin Luther for questioning the Pope? I mean they had no assassination attempts or nothing, why?      And why did they not kill him but killed the guy who was caught carrying a bible translated into German from him?

20090223111630AAzwf6Y	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does anyone else have an intense dislike for people who live their entire lives on benefits?	Before you start shouting at me I DONT CARE IF YOU THINK I AM WRONG OR UNFAIR!!!   The only people that I don't have a problem with claiming benefits is the SEVERLY mentally disabled (not people who are just depressessed or have anxiety, it never stopped me working, and my uncle is a Dr with Bi-Polar don't dare say that stops people working), the SEVERLY physically disabled and people who are genuinely seeking work whilst on JSA.      I live in an area where alot of people are on benefits and its cos they are lazy bastards who's whole family have been on benefits their whole lives.  They get all the money thrown at them whilst other hard working people work to fund them.  They pop out benefit babies one after another and the bloody labour government just throws more money at them.  Free bloody rent, free prescriptions etc etc.  Get a ******* job you lazt bastards.  Half the bloody people on here are on benefits, if they do have to get it they should get the bare min to survive, they should have money spare for any luxuries like cigs, booze or the bloody internet!!  Its a disgrace, instead of giving it to the leeches of society reduce the workers taxes!!       If they do get it they should have to do community service for it.  I also think that benefits should be paid for one kid then none after, people on benefits should have to have the contraceptive implant so they can't keep popping out their benefit babies!   Single parents should have to do community service whilst their kids are at school!  2 parent families or should have to do community service in turn whilst the other parent looks after the kids.      This country is in economic crisis and these drains on society are making it worse!!

20090223111751AAEwq3h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is it easier for some to give than to receive?	It is natural for me to do something for somebody else, without even considering the impact (emotional, physical, spiritual, financial) it could produce in my life. Likewise, the same carries over with my walk (or lack thereof according to some) with God. Trusting God and directing others to His faithfulness and promises, and desiring His goodness and love over them are first-nature for me. For myself it is the opposite and it doesn't’t even fall on the nature scale, and if it did it would be smack-daddy last!      Yet when things arise -even though I know (knowledge vs. wisdom theory rings true) that God’s love is unconditional, a life of joy, hope, and everything else is more than possible if I allow Him to do what needs to be done – I dissociate myself from it. It’s almost like I can’t handle it. I can’t handle thinking about His goodness applied to my life; He’s done enough already. I can’t handle people saying “What God has for you…” and I can’t handle hearing about it in sermons. It suffocates me. I simply don’t know how; or I’m afraid; or something else altogether. I simply do not see the point.

20090223112501AAuN8hS	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What do I do about these bad room mates?	On December 14, 2008 my fiance's brother "Brian" and his girlfriend "Kathy" moved in to our house. We welcomed the move with open arms; it was going to help us all out. A neighbor at their previous apartment complex was very verbally abusive to his family and Brian and Kathy had just had enough (the landlord never did anything about the numerous complaints, so they decided the best thing to do was move). We saw the extra income as a huge blessing. They agreed to pay half the rent = $400 a month. With the economy the way it is, you can understand what a big help this would be.       So here's the problem(s): Since they've moved in there has been a problem with cleaning... they don't clean up after themselves. At all. They sleep until 3 - 5PM everyday, then get on the computer and play World of Warcraft all night. I'll be leaving for work at 6:30Am and they are still up on the computer, and they wake up after I get home. Needless to say, neither of them has found a job yet.       My fiance and I are at the end of our rope. We've tried leading by example (washing their dishes, picking up their clutter in an obvious manner), and we've tried subtle hints and mild discussions. After absolutely no improvement, it turned into an all out arguement. Brian said that they felt we were hinting for them to be our personal cleaning slaves, so they decided between themselves to do nothing at all (to teach us a lesson, I suppose).       I brought up the employment issue and he stated he had filled out for three jobs since they moved in (Wal-Mart, Auto Zone, and Khols) and so "its not like he isn't trying to get a job". He doesn't believe that Kathy should work at all because she goes to night classes at the local community college, thus the reason she hasn't even looked for a work.       The whole thing finally came to a close when we told them to begin packing their belongings and find someone else to mooch from. We gave them two weeks, meaning their last day here will be March 7, 2009. Ever since, they have been staying in their bedroom, not speaking to us, and definately not looking for employment or housing. The tension in my home is unbearable, and I would rather work late just to avoid as much uneasiness as possible.       We're at our wits end.. what else can we do? Is there something we should have sone differently?      By the way, I am 23, my fiance is 21.    Brain and Kathy are both 20.
