AA11693263	I am in the diagnosing stage at this point but I can tell you about my symptoms. I have been having issues for over 3 1/2 years now. I have what feels like full body, from my toes to my chin, RLS but horribly painful. It feels like bees are stinging my bones. I get stabbing pains in my feet. Places in both feet burn and go numb. My feet, arms and hands fall asleep but not that pins and needles feeling, they just go completely numb. Sometimes it feel like someone is poking my fingertips and toes with sharp needles. I have what is described as the MS hug around my chest. It feels like my chest is being squeezed. I have Trigeminal Neuralgia which affects the nerves in my face and makes me have the stabbing pains in my temples. jaw, cheeks, ears, top of my head and the back of my head. This is horrible and I have been to the emergency room on may occasions at 3 am because nothing would take the pain away. If I am not taking the medication to keep this pain away my legs get so weak that I can't walk. I get constant UTI's and kidney infections. I lose my words, forget what I am talking about in the middle of a conversation and often can't remember things that happened just yesterday. I have muscle spasms frequently. There have been times that I have been writing that I have had one and then pen just flew right out of my hand (that can be pretty funny at times, you got to find the humor wherever you can. right :), I had on in my neck the other day that hurt like heck and kind of scared me a little. It was so bad that I felt like if it were anymore intense it would have just snapped my neck. I get them all the time in my legs and just look like a crazy woman sometimes. (Again, those are the times when I just have to either laugh or cry. Although sometimes I do cry, I try to keep positive about it all). I can't work any longer as the pain is too bad when I am on my feet all day. I can't drive right now because I am afraid I will have a muscle spasm in my legs and cause a wreck. I am female, 36 years old, am married to the greatest man in the world who helps me out and understands that I can't do a lot of the things I want to do and tries to figure out ways for me to do them anyway:) I don't know how, but I hope I helped with the information you wanted to know.

2xAMjrgyaa	Sit back... this is a LONG answer, but I wanted to help you out! I know it can be frustrating. This REALLY works!! There are 3 people sent me an email saying to me that it worked for them!! This was also been chosen by 10 members to be the best answer because it worked for them too!! Proof, see my best answers!!<br>  <br>  Gather all materials beforehand -- see "Things You'll Need" below. You might want to store them in a waterproof resealable bag, such as Ziploc. I'd recommend wearing either old clothes or a bathrobe over whatever you are wearing. There is a definite possibility this is going to spill. After you have found everything on you checklist, head to a large, flat, waterproof surface. This is probably your bathroom. Having this room be private is highly advised; you can't just say, "Get out, I'm flattening a pimple," can you?<br>  <br>  Things You'll Need<br>  - 3 or more cotton balls<br>  - Lukewarm tap water<br>  - Cup to hold the water in<br>  - Salt<br>  <br>  The Method<br>  1. Salt the water thoroughly -- much more than you think it needs.<br>  2. Dip one cotton ball in the salt water.<br>  3. Wait for 30 - 60 seconds.<br>  4. Squeeze out excess water out until it is damp, but not dripping.<br>  5. Place the damp cotton ball over your large, oh-my-goodness-I-cannot-go-to-... zit. If you have several of these grouped together, try to place the cotton ball over them all.<br>  6. Glance at your watch/clock. Wait exactly three minutes.<br>  7. Remove the cotton ball after the time is up. The zit seems to be nearly gone, but it is only the top that has dissolved. Your acne is still there.<br>  8. Take the other two cotton balls and place them on either side of the despised pimple.<br>  9. Slowly, move them closer together until the tiny bump is flattened. Congrats! You've just conquered that giant of a pimple -- forever!<br>  10. Apply honey on the infected area & go to sleep!!<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  *Don't forget the last 3 steps -- they are crucial.<br>  *Be sure to follow these steps closely. Dipping a cottonball in fresh water as opposed to salt will not work, for instants.<br>  * You might want to bring a book -- either waterproof or one that you do not care about being splattered in water. Those three minutes can get boring.<br>  * This is your best bet for monster zits that simply sneak up on you. For long-term healthy skin, cleansing and toning is also important.<br>  <br>  Warnings<br>  * Please, PLEASE, do not assume this is permission to "pop" pimples. Doing so can cause major scarring. Please don't pop them.<br>  * If you stop after the top is dissolved, I must warn you: it WILL come back! Maybe not in the next five minutes, but during the course of an hour, it will come back!<br>  <br>  You can even try applying original Head & Shoulder Shampoo to clear acne!!! I WORKS like a charm!! Read all about it here including people's comment about it!<br>  <a href="http://www.myhomeremedies.com/remedy.cgi..." rel="nofollow">http://www.myhomeremedies.com/remedy.cgi...</a><br>  <br>  If you feel new pimples erupting, ice it! Hold an ice cube over the area for about 5-10 minutes. It REALLY works!!!<br>  <br>  For acne scars, <br>  1. Lemon juice is natural bleach and helps in lightening the scars and blemishes of the skin.<br>  2. Rosehip seed oil is also another home remedy which reduces acne scars. It is mostly used in the cosmetic products and used for acne scarring, facial scarring, surgical scars, sun damage, premature aging, burn marks etc. This oil should be massaged twice on the acne scars daily.<br>  3. Application of Aloe Vera gel/juice to the fresh wounds prevents the formation of permanent scars.<br>  4. One of the home remedy is that ice cubes can be rubbed on the acne scars for ten to fifteen minutes.<br>  5. Vitamin E is considered best for the healthy glowing skin. Application of vitamin E oil or capsule to the scar will completely vanish the scar in few weeks.<br>  6. The most effective remedy for the scars is application of honey several times a day. It will give a natural glow to the skin and will remove all scars.<br>  <br>  If you have too many pimples/whiteheads/blackheads/ acne/acne scars/... I recommend you to try Carley's Clear & Smooth!! It's CHEAPER & BETTER than Proactive!! People are raving about this product!! Read their feedbacks/reviews!!<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Adult-Acne-The-best-..." rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Adult-Acne-The-best-...</a><br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!
f8mLpPXlaa	I'm not sure where your dad got the penicillin from but that's another issue. You don't say that you say that you are coughing which i find strange too because someone with bronchitis that's what they mostly complain about. the fact that you say you can't eat or drink rightkinda points to a stomach bug. And what do you mean by "correctly"?<br>  And besides the penicillin what else did he give you? You said "a couple" of shots.<br>  Sorry but something just doesn't sound right about this.<br>  God bless.|`|8ca4e1bf1d27b6b183464e694ae56d4baa	see a doctor.  bronchitis can lead to pneumonia.  if that is what you have.<br>  <br>  go here for information.<br>  <a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/infections/common/mulitsource/677.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bronchitis/DS00031" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bronchi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-bronchitis-basics" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/under...</a>|`|HMKiEJ45aa	It could just be a cold. The fatigueness and loss of appetite are common symptoms for lots of things. If you start coughing up stuff and hearing your lungs make crackly/squeaky noises when you breathe in and out, this may be bronchitis. Mucinex DM works well, that's what my doctor prescribes me, I have chronic bronchitis.(You dont need a prescription for it though)<br>  Drinking lots of fluids and taking vitamins, resting, and just really believing you will be healed helps if you don't want to take medicine.<br>  <br>  You may be allergic to penicillin if you felt like you were dying while getting the shot. I'd go see a doctor if you don't feel better soon.
rxjdovzyaa	PKD is a genetic disease, and it can arise from mutations in the genes which control it. I f one parent has the disease, there is a 50 percent chance that the disease gene will pass to a child. In some cases PKD occurs spontaneously and, neither of the parents carries a copy of the disease gene.  Since the spontaneous rate is so high, that means the mutations occurs often by chance, so the disease occurs equally in all countries and racial groups.  So as far as we know the disease has always existed.<br>  <br>  In 1957 O. Dalgaard published a study establishing the nature of inheritance of PKD, and in 1985 genetic studies identified at least one of the genes involved although there may be others that have not yet been identified.
ohFvHdp6aa	Candidiasis is better known as a "yeast infection" and occurs when the pH levels of your vagina (or penis) go a little bit whacko, causing yest to grow a little out of control. In all honesty, your body is covered in a small amount of yeast, and it's healthy for it to be there. But when it gets out of control in those certain areas, it can cause itching, burning, redness, that disgusting odor, and white discharge. There are plenty of creams you can use to treat and get rid of the infections, and many are available over-the counter if not through prescription. Using yogurt also helps, since it has natural bacteria which combat yeast. I've also heard that honey helps, and it did help relieve the symptoms of a yeast infection I had early last year.<br>  Almost all women and many men do get yeast infections. They can be caused by douching, poor hygiene, and, yes, they can be "transmitted" through sex. It is not, however, and STD. It's just a very very common (and slightly unfortunate) female problem.|`|rXAUJtt1aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidiasis</a><br>  <br>  read it...and yes you can "transmit" it.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Yes, this can be spread to and from men:<br>  <br>  In men, symptoms include red patchy sores near the head of the penis or on the foreskin, severe itching, and/or a burning sensation. Candidiasis of the penis can also have a white discharge, although uncommon. However, having no symptoms at all is common, and usually, a more severe form of the symptoms may emerge later.|`|gOwakeM1aa	Candidiasis, comonly called yeast infection or thrush, is a fungal infection. Most infections are treatable and result  in minimal complications such as redness, itching and discomfort, though if left untreated can cause major complications. Candidias can also occur on the male genitals, partner's mucosal membranes of the oral cavity (mouth and throat). <br>  <br>   But the trqnsmission of Candidias to the male genital is less common however, yeast infection on the penis from direct contact is common. <br>  <br>  Be straight forward with him it will only be worse for you and him if you wait. Hope and pray all works out ok for you!

HYTmfxbYaa	Water intoxication (also known as hyperhydration or water poisoning) is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside of safe limits by over-consumption of water.[1] Normal, healthy (both physically and nutritionally) individuals have little to worry about accidentally consuming too much water. Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal individuals have resulted either from water drinking contests, in which individuals attempt to consume more than 10 liters (2.2 imp gal; 2.6 U.S. gal) of water over the course of just a few minutes, or long bouts of intensive exercise during which electrolytes are not properly replenished, yet massive amounts of fluid are still consumed.|`|ZAxoLFfpaa	yes<br>  six liters of water in three hours|`|xwZV9jgPaa	A good way to judge that you are drinking enuf water is if when you go to the bathroom, your urine is clear. Start off with the recomended 8 glasses a day, after 2 days check and see if your urine is clear, if its still yellow up the ammount of water by about a glass, try that again for a couple days and check again. You can drown your body by ingesting too much fluid, remember the terry schavio case? If you don't look it up, she basically drowned her body into a coma. Your insides will swell. You can not drink a gallon of liquid in a half hour....it's impossible.|`|LqaxvacSaa	Yes.  Drinking too much water will dilute the electrolytes in your body.  Electrolytes are ions that are responsible for maintaining a membrane potential in the cells of your body.  Without a membrane potential nerve conduction stops and death results, most likely due to cardiac arrest.  <br>  However, you will likely never drink too much water, and you should only be concerned in situations where you are purposely overdrinking.  <br>  Like the woman in "hold your wee for a wii"|`|k4gD8mzyaa	I read that someone drowned themselves for entering a water drinking comp to win game consoles and stuff. But they were drinking like.. 7 liters within about half an hour. So if you drink about 3 liters a day you're all good. However if you have more, make sure it's not all at once and it's spaced out throughout the day.|`|QRpB5pFXaa	there is such thing as drinkng too much water.

It takes alot of water to do that though.|`|R6wjTZ63aa	Yes If you consume more than 2 gallons of water within a couple hours, it could very well kill you|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	Yes. definately.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|n7BuH75gaa	Yes, you can get water poisoning.|`|XKhNw221aa	about 100 cups of water would kill you.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	yes....|`|XiLco8XXaa	You can drink as much water as you want!

oR40n3kPaa	18% body fat means that you have 40.5 lbs of fat based on 225 lbs that you currently weigh. (225 lbs x 18% )<br>  <br>  In order to consider yourself fit, you should range between 12-15% body fat, so you must lose 3 to 6% or 7lbs to 16 lbs of just fat.  You need to do more cardio or cross training in order to burn the fat.  By burning fat your muscle ratio should increase allowing you to be more defined and more fit.|`|LqaxvacSaa	According to your BMI, that weight would make you overweight; however, if you are athletic then you are probably not fat. 18% body fat is at the lower range of "acceptable" for men.  <br>  Personally, I would consider 225 lbs at your height to be on the heavy side, but it is all about how you feel.  Do you feel healthy? Are you able to job a lot without getting winded?  <br>  Remember Tom Cruise is considered overweight according to BMI and Paris Hilton is considered "normal."  BMI is based on a formula, so anyone who is taller or more athletic than the regular population gets a "less accurate" reading.  <br>  <br>  *Muscle weighs more than fat primarily because it holds much more water.|`|KwdtzmKhaa	the bmi website takes into account averages. the only way to really know if you're too heavy is to go to a doctor and get evaluated. 18% is not too bad , it is at the lower end of the acceptable range.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthchecksystems.com/bodyfat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthchecksystems.com/bodyfa...</a>|`|JOhnsmrOaa	I'm not sure about your measurements but I know the fact that the bmi doesn't allow for the differences in muscle & fat is a flaw of using that as a guide|`|CsIvy5MAaa	BMI will tell body builders they are obese. BMI is a guideline at best, take ANY result from it with a grain of salt, as it clearly does not calculate fat vs muscle weight.|`|oojO4WAraa	It doesn't really, especially for people that have a lot of muscle.  The BMI is just a guideline and it doesn't take into account about muscle weighing more than fat, or that some people work out a lot.
ciz0qYwnaa	Congrats girl : ) I've been there too. <br>  <br>  You should eat three meals a day with one or two small snacks in between, so you'll have loads of energy. Aim for a minimum of 1,200 calories a day, if not more. Your breakfast should be filling. You should have some carbs in it, like cereal or an English muffin or toast.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	Then your Dr. should be giving you a plan to get back to normal eating|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	Congratulations:)<br>  I would think starting out small, such as 200 calories per meal then working it up in 100 calories intervals every week or 2 weeks until you reach the healthy calorie intake of 1940. Though I intake about 1200-1500 calories a day and exercise daily and i'm just fine and healthy.  then go for about a half hour or hour jog sometime during the day, if you over do it you will most likely feel weak. Good luck:)|`|ilUkTIkWaa	well done!! i would sugest going to a dietician and she/he can make a meal plan for you, that will suit your needs.<br>  As for the exercise I think you should probably go see your gp who can tell you how much you should be doing, depending on your blood pressure and heart rate.<br>  Congrats for taking the first steps to recovery.<br>  stay safe<br>  xox|`|2VdYfOznaa	Don't exercise so much and just eat the kind of meals that you see your friends eat.

Food is your friend if you remember that you eat to provide your body the building blocks it needs to function properly. So try to get a wide variety of fruit and vegetables (the more different colors you consume, the better), whole grain carbohydrates, nuts, and good sources of protein such as lean meat, eggs, and fish (oily fish is fine as well, since that provide your body with lots of essential fatty acids).<br>  <br>  As for exercise, don't go overboard, and try to put more emphasis on resistance training (weights) than cardio in order to build muscle tone.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|rxScdXM4aa	eat plenty of hardy meals. eat between meals with nutrient dense snacks like bananas, apples and nuts. they are healthy but they also promote weight gain.<br>  <br>  stay away from bad fats because they can damage you internally with out any outward indications.<br>  <br>  eat! eat!|`|hWvvrEphaa	Drink weight gainer with your meals.

If you're really committed, try going vegan until then.  I've lost two pounds just this week since I went vegan (two pounds is a lot for me... I'm 5'9 and 124.5 lbs now).  Good luck!|`|XZltyLhqaa	you should really just run<br>  running is the best exercise that you can do<br>  it works out your whole body and will allow you to lose the weight :]
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|TKNPveHDaa	I eat healthy, I get 8 hours of sleep, I don't watch tv, I play sports, I eat breakfast, I don't drink a lot of beer, I drink NO soda, I read and stay spiritually strong, and I try hard to look good for my wife.<br>  <br>  It works.|`|76hhm6Quaa	Whenever I start putting on some weight I always do the same thing, Diet and Exercise. Now, when I diet I try to cut out most carbs, sugar, and alot of sodium. My favorite foods when I am on a diet is fruits, veggies & salad, grilled/boiled chicken, grilled turkey breast (I make both my chicken and turkey on my george foreman grill which I love!, and brown rice. I also go to the gym 3-4 times a week for about 45min-1hr I do 20 minutes on the treadmill on cardio setting, 10-15 minutes on the elliptical  machine on the fat burn/weight less setting and for the rest of the time I work on the machines that work my legs, my arms, and my abs, I also do 50 regular crunches and 50 knee raise crunches once in the morning and once at night. I drink about 4-6 12fl oz bottles of water a day and about 2-3 glasses of tea (Made with Tea Bags) without any sugar. Just cut out the junk food, eat healthy, and work out! I average about 2 pounds a week with this plan, it works great for me but you should really try to come up with your own plan that works for you, just remember everybody is different so you may lose weight slower or faster depending on your body. Good Luck!|`|UM9LlPWDaa	I am currently trying to lose weight. I have always been very thin but sugar makes me gain weight really fast. I gained 15-20 pounds in the last year so I am trying to lose at least 10 of it. <br>  <br>  I eat smaller portions of food, exercise, and cut down on my sugar intake by a lot.|`|ZXxgz4Xtaa	Well Im not trying to look young as I am 19 but I lost 10lbs from just str8 cold turkey with soda, went from 183-173 and then I started heavy cardio +situps and crunches and now im down to 152ish :) I'm 5'7 btw!
uJKTR4d2aa	You should measure your hips, waist, thighs, and chest. In another month measure again and compare. Thats the best way to track progress. I didnt think i could see a difference with me but i fit back into my old clothes now|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I would have thought that you would have started to see a difference now. Considering that your family have seen a difference maybe you are being a bit hard on yourself. I would think that you will start seeing a difference very soon, just continue.|`|CW4dGrJbaa	Stay positive!  Think of the working out as you're being healthy, and not so much about the pounds.  Fill up on vegetables and lean meats and foods that are high in fiber; fiber keeps you full and is very good for you!  Stay away from greasy and empty carb foods!  It sounds like you're really giving it your all at the gym, so good job!  It'll definitely pay off!|`|ugAG1QLfaa	it might be the way your eating and even if your eating healthy u still need to watch your portions. keep at it and dont be discouraged. u will see a difference soon =]|`|kKEcR4Rtaa	Measure the places you want to tone everyweek. And remember to watch your diet it helps.|`|UMYda9Jaaa	Keep up the good work at the gym!  Sometimes it's hard to tell when your body is changing because most people can't look at themselves objectively. If you don't want to weigh yourself, I would suggest that you measure yourself instead to mark changes in your body. Just use a fabric measuring tape and measure around the fullest part of your hips, stomach, bust and arms once a week. Write down your measurements to keep track of your progress. That way when you see the numbers getting smaller you'll get a little encouragement to keep working rather than being discouraged because things aren't moving along as fast as you'd like.<br>  <br>  It's also possible that since you're exercising more, you're also eating more to compensate and therefore not losing weight. Remember that even if you have very toned muscles, if you still have fat covering them you won't be able to see the muscles underneath. Part of having a healthy body is making permanent changes to your diet. Keep track of what you eat for a week and then look for small things that you can change without starving yourself or making it overly difficult to meet your goals. Make one or two small changes to your diet every week until you're eating habits are a little more healthy. For example, cut out anything that has refined flour or sugars (complex carbs) and replace with whole grain products. Those are the major inhibitors of weight loss in America because manufacturers put them in almost all foods as cheap fillers and flavor enhancers and many people who they're on healthy diets don't even realize they're consuming large amounts on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  It is generally considered healthy to lose 1-2 pounds per week with exercise and healthy eating, but sometimes it takes a while to see a difference in your body, even with hard work. It will help if you determine what your body type and ideal weight are so that you have a defined goal to work toward. To determine your body type and calculate your ideal weight, go to this website: <a href="http://www.healthcentral.com/diet-exercise/ideal-body-weight-3146-143.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcentral.com/diet-exerci...</a><br>  <br>  Even if over time you don't see as much of a difference as you would like to, realize that your organs and body systems will thank you for this lifestyle change and you will be healthy longer because of it. Good luck!
hPDMDrTqaa	Run 1/2 mile to 1 mile every day, do a lot of Calisthenics, and eat no more than 2,000 calories a day. I reccomend doing calisthenics twice a day, and try to run for as long as you can each day as you'll burn a lot of calories in a short time running and its a great way to lose weight. But keep hydrated and drink a lot of water. Do as many push ups and crunches as you can twice a day, do 20-30 jumping jacks, 20-30 lunges, and 20-30 leg lifts aswell twice a day for your Calisthenics. Also I reccomend doing 10 eight count body builders twice a day, and to increase the amount of Calisthenics you do gradually by 5, I increase them weekly for me until I reach a high number then I try to maintain that number in the weeks to come.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	1 lb = 3700 calories.<br>  3 miles of low intensity jogging/running/walking = 370 calories of fat.<br>  <br>  30 miles walking/jogging = 1 lb of weight lost, permanently.<br>  <br>  Throw in swimming, cycling, cut out sodas and ALL junk food; eat more veggies, fruit and chicken; less beef and fried foods; and you should be able to drop 1.5-2lbs lbs a week easy if you can do 6 miles a day 5x per week.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods.

You've probably just gained muscle, and thats going to be key in keeping your metabolism up. The best way to lose weight and keep it off is by eating foods that make you feel full, are good for you, and will bring you to your ideal healthy weight. It worked for me so I started sharing what I learned with other people. You can find one of my articles on How To Eat For Lose Weight at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4732542_eat-lose..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4732542_eat-lose...</a>|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Muscle weighs more than fat. So if you're going to the gym that may be why you've gained weight. You don't want to measure your progress by weight for that reason. You should measure parts of your body with a cloth measuring tape and that's where you'll see the difference. Also watch your calorie intake, stay away from sodas and drink 64 oz of water. good luck!|`|9dcvN2KFaa	You have probably put on weight since joining th gym as you are making muscle, stick with it though, just means it's working.

a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	My boyfriends mother lost weight on the cambridge diet, it's a fast and effective way to shed those extra pounds, but you're right, your eating habits will need to change for life after. You use the cambridge diet as a quick and effective fix, but afterwards, as long as there is no medical reason (such as an overactive thyroid) for you being overweight then there is no reason for you to pile the pounds back on again. You were overweight to start with because you'd picked up bad habits and need to re-educate yourself. Exercise at least 3 days a week, be that going for a brisk walk, joining the gym or doing an exercise video at home. And just don't eat unhealthy foods. Avoid processed, junk and fried foods, instead opt for whole foods, fresh fruit and veg, and opt for grilled, steamed, poached or oven cooked food. If you need to snack make sure it's healthy, no more chocolate, cakes, pastries (just don't buy these foods, if they're not in the house you won't eat them) think about portion sizes and learn about food labelling. Avoid any food that is high in fat, salt or sugar. if you're hungry, first drink a glass of water, put your knife and fork down between bites, eat consciously (not sitting in front of the TV) - really acknowledge every mouthful, and STOP eating when you're full. If you start putting weight back on when you are following these tips then you are simply eating too much...cut down on portion size. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't worry, after a while it will become 2nd nature. While the cambridge diet is great as a kick start, it's this new lifestyle that will give you a new zest and energy for life!|`|Ed5mLXMfaa	It is true many do pile the pounds back on after a very low calorie diet, the best way to avoid this is introducing calories gradullay like recommended in the book you should have got. Also keep carbs to a minimum will help no end in fact that also helps people to lose weight.  Carbs are the worst enemy for weight problems, your body stores them as fat.  Its good that you are thinking about this now as you will know what you need to do to maintain your new figure|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	I m not sure that you can prevent from gaining it back, that diet does not teach you new eating so you go right back to your old ones, the body needs food to work properly so once you have gone off food for a while when the body stores everything to fat because you have put it in a starvation mode. I think adding food slowly back into your diet. The key to any successful diet is learning how to change bad eating habits to good ones.

I recommend my patients take at least 1500mg of EPA.  The fatty acid targets the brain and has a tremendous impact on anxiety, mood disorders and ADHD.  You can also take at least 1000IU of Vitamin D per day.  These two together should do the trick - and if they don't I would consult a naturopathic doctor.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
eVk8yPy2aa	I think the best way to stick at anything whether your trying to diet or save money, is to keep busy! The more you keep busy the less you'll be thinking about food. A little snack here an there is nothing to worry about as long as your exercising for at least 30 mins everyday. When you walk to work it is best to walk quite briskly if you are to make the most of walking to work, you will burn more calories this way. As for activities around the house the list is endless, a few things you could try:<br>  - Wacking on a CD and dancing to it for half an hour<br>  - Jogging on the spot, star jumps you know all those things they made you do in P.E!!!<br>  - Cleaning will work up a sweat, vacuuming, polishing etc<br>  - Get yourself a workout DVD<br>  - If you have a Wii you could get a Wii fit<br>  <br>  One final thing, why not set yourself something to look forward to, this could be setting one day a week as take away day or buy an item of clothing in the size your aiming for! Good luck!!|`|YseOZhI5aa	First think of eating like this... "I eat to live not live to eat"<br>  Continue walking every day and eating healthy.<br>  I would suggest to eat every two hours. ex...small meal, snack, small meal, snack, small meal... till about 7pm. (keeps your metabolism going)<br>  Drink water before and after each meal to fill you up faster. <br>  get yourself some small dumb bells and use them daily... nothing big just like 2 sets of ten to fifteen in the am and pm.

AA11785060	Pretty much normal dude, many guys don't ejaculate the first time inside, or even after several times.  As you said, you have no physical prob ejaculating, so it is all subconscious. Means you are a caring and concerned guy, and subconsciously you are concerned about ejaculating inside her-- for fear of pregnancy or hurting her during your climax, or maybe both- but lots of guys have this happen.  You will get more comfortable and relaxed after a few times, and it will happen.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Proper diet and exercise.

dpgXzMenaa	Funny you should ask: my GF just went through this and got the final results a couple of days ago.<br>  <br>  A normal breast exam will only give clues, not diagnosis... but cysts tend to follow the normal contours and pattern of the lobes of breast tissue and just change the size and texture of them, while cancerous growths tend instead to distort the normal shape by pushing tisues out of the way.<br>  <br>  That's not always the case though, and usually a mammogram and/or ultrasound exam is necessary to properly determine the nature of the lumps.

You probably have strep throat.  Avoid eating anything that is spicy or drinking anything carbonated- like soda.  It's not the sugar in it that made your throat start hurting, it was the carbonation in it and possibly the caffeine.  Drink warm tea, soups etc and you may want to go to the doctor to get an antibiotic.  You can also take tylenol and ibuprofen to help with the pain.

nAp688tZaa	You can't really prevent them.  If you have a trauma to your spine that is bad enough to cause a herniation, then that is all there is to it.  You can use Physical Therapy to strengthen your neck muscles which will help hold up the vertebrae, but once a herniation has occurred, there is only one real way to fix it and that is surgery.  If the herniation is not causing any immediate harm/risk to your spinal cord, you can always try alternative therapy methods to deal with the pain and avoid getting cut open. If there is a risk of damage to your spinal cord from the herniation, then you will definitely need to go the surgical route.

They could harm you as they increase seratonin in your body which is needed if someone is depressed, and NOT if one isn't depressed.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	It all depends on the medication. If it's an MAOI (Monoamine oxidase inhibitor) it might cause you to have mild physical reactions, such as tummy pains , head aches, that kind of thing (it will also cause weight gain) If taken for a long time it might cause brain damage.  If you are taking them Stop now and go to the hospital <br>  <br>  If you are taking an SSRI Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor STOP NOW and go to the hospital, if you do not need it, it can be deadly, you will have increased serotonin levels and this can cause you to become very depressed, violent, and  a danger to yourself and others. You will experience no symptoms the first week, then you will experience rapid thoughts, and blurred vision, you will also experience audio and visual hallucination, with in 4 weeks you will experience OCD like symptoms and you will be come extremely irritable and manic. This will also cause brain damage <br>  <br>  if this is left to progress you may even become violent to others. <br>  <br>  if you do not  have depression but take anti-depressants you may run a risk of causing permanent brain damage. <br>  <br>  List of SSRIs <br>      * citalopram (Celexa, Cipramil, Dalsan, Recital,Seropram)<br>      * escitalopram (Lexapro, Cipralex, Esertia)<br>      * fluoxetine (Prozac, Fontex, Seromex, Seronil, Sarafem, Fluctin)<br>      * fluvoxamine (Luvox, Fevarin, Faverin, Dumyrox, Favoxil, Movox)<br>      * paroxetine (Paxil,  Rexetin, Xetanor, Paroxat)<br>      * sertraline (Zoloft, Lustral, Serlain)<br>      * zimelidine (Zelmid, Normud)<br>  <br>  <br>  List of MAOIs <br>      * Iproclozide (Sursum)<br>      * Iproniazid (Marsilid, Iprozid, Ipronid, Rivivol, Propilniazida)<br>      * Isocarboxazid (Marplan)<br>      * Mebanazine (Actomol)<br>      * Metfendrazine (H.M.-11)<br>      * Nialamide (Niamid)<br>      * Phenelzine (Nardil)<br>      * Pheniprazine (Catron)<br>      * Phenoxypropazine (Drazine)<br>      * Pivalylbenzhydrazine (Tersavid, Neomarsilid)<br>      * Safrazine (Safra)<br>      * Tranylcypromine (Parnate, Jatostrom)|`|AztCTaQlaa	Hmm most likely you would be tired but not high (going by the kind of anti-depressants I was prescribed and all I have heard out there have similar effects) and then you're body would get used to them a little.

The effect you get will depend on the type of anti-depressent. The two most common types are :-<br>  <br>  *Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors- work by blocking the reabsorbtion on the hormone Seretonin. Seretonin makes you feel happy. Some examples of SSRI's are:-<br>  ■Citalopram (Celexa)<br>  ■Escitalopram (Lexapro)<br>  ■Fluoxetine (Prozac, Prozac Weekly)<br>  ■Paroxetine (Paxil, Paxil CR, Pexeva)<br>  ■Sertraline (Zoloft)<br>  <br>  <br>  *Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)- Not prescribed as often as SSRI's. This type of antidepressent works by preventing the enzyme monoamine oxidase from metabolizing the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (nor-ep-ih-NEF-rin), serotonin (ser-oh-TOE-nin) and dopamine (DOE-puh-mene) in the brain. As a result, these levels remain high in the brain, boosting mood.<br>  Some examples of MAOI's are:-<br>  ■Phenelzine (Nardil)<br>  ■Tranylcypromine (Parnate)<br>  ■Isocarboxazid (Marplan)<br>  ■Selegiline (Emsam)<br>  <br>  Stopping any depressent suddenly is not advised and many interact with other medication so be very careful|`|YH2awKonaa	You may have an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior at the start of treatment with an antidepressant medication, especially if you are under 18 years old. Talk with your doctor about this risk. While you are taking Celexa you will need to be monitored for worsening symptoms of depression and/ or suicidal thoughts during the first weeks of treatment, or whenever your dose is changed. In addition to you watching for changes in your own symptoms, your family or other caregivers should be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Your doctor will need to check you at regular visits for at least the first 12 weeks of treatment.

To get that prescription, you have to be fitted with that brand first at the Dr's office, to know if they will even fit you right.<br>  <br>  Contacts can fit very differently from one brand to another, even if the size is the same.<br>  <br>  Besides, any site you want to order from is going to call the Dr. to verify that you have a proper prescription for them.
cwkpGa3daa	i had braces too, but i have a bottom retainer that doesn't come out, it's just a solid wire on the inside of my bottom teeth, very handy. and you can even see it. maybe you should go back to the dent. and see what the dr. can do for you?  i mean they shouldn't be moving after you spent all the money on them!! :P<br>  good luckk.       <br>  <br>  oh ya, and the bottom one doesn't come out, its hard to discribe... just a little wire. simple and i dont even remember it's there. :)|`|7768c8dcdb016c6829ece91b570bbad8aa	Your teeth have internal memory regarding the original space, and they will always try to go back to that place, thus you have to wear your retainers life long : ))|`|JjbragXNaa	I have the exact same thing.  It's from crowding on the bottom teeth.  You can see your orthodontist who would probably made a retainer to fix it.  I actually like mine, tho, it gives it personality.  :)|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I have this too. It's just the bottom teeth though! I have asked repeatedly about it, but have been told that the only way to fix it is to have braces again. Teeth do tend to move, or so my dentist tells me. Next time I go I plan to have him kinda "grind" the sides of the teeth on the outside, and the one in the middle of the other two so that the whole thing is less noticeable.<br>  <br>  I had braces for five years, and faithfully wore my retainer for another 10 years after that. My teeth still moved. I'm 28 now, and I cannot get the bottom retainer on.|`|2uZivThaaa	if you don't wear you retainer or they didn't give you a permanent bottom retainer they will shift, typically your supposed to wear it every night for a few years or until your 18 or they'll go back to being crooked|`|xpu4XgPXaa	Ure supposed to wear a retainer in your sleep.|`|Ch39oU58aa	you have to wear your retainers or your teeth will shift|`|GMdK9AQLaa	you have to wear the retainer they give you or your teeth will go back to how they used to be.  you are supposed to wear it for up to 3 years.  i am 16 and they told me i am supposed to wear my retainer until the end of high school, possibly freshman year of college.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	I don't get that about bottom teeth, but it seems to get worse the older you get.  <br>  <br>  I now have 2 teeth on the bottom that aren't straight.

a531cd98fd2b70b96fa7a80f7571935eaa	I always try and work like muscles on the same day. Bench press and Triceps exercises. And Bicep and shoulders. You wanna go in working your muscles to the full extent, cant do that if they are weak and sore. Biceps are my favorite, I could do em every other day, but routine is everything, I like to start on mondays with bench press because when your tired and not in the mood to work out, bench press is easy to do and then you feel the pump and can do another workout. A few months ago I tried a workout where I did nothing but bicep pullups and flat benchpress, got pretty big honestly, in the arms, but thats a lazy workout. You need to write down what you want to start at and increase the weight 5-10 lbs a week<br>  <br>  Bench press works your triceps also, especially with closed grip, so you'll wanna do bench first, don't bounce it off your chest, bring it a couple inches within. I hurt my chest doin that, it still cracks. Take a supplement to, to keep you in the mood to work out. I like NO-Xplode. Theres a LOT of differnet bench press workouts, depending on toning or bulking up, I like to increase in wieight within sets. But you have to have a spotter to get bigger, it all depends on that extra rep or two you can never get by yourself. And rest a minute in between each set. Drink a lot of water and breath correctly and always do a warmup set.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	No pain, no gain ........yes its fine.....if your still getting sore your not working out much.....|`|vx2MaQg0aa	yea i guess its ok..

a1KqdXLXaa	From a dental hygienist:  Colgate total (original) don't at this point go with any whitening toothpastes, one:  because they don't work, and two:  they may cause sensitivity in 'not tip top teeth'.

So:  Colgate total, and listerine with fluoride.|`|MujKSebLaa	Tom of Maine's toothpaste (the one with propolis and myrrh), Amway Glister mouthwash and a Soladey toothbrush.

laVGEEeraa	The best way to take care of your skin is washing it; before you go to bed, when you get up, after a work-out.  <br>  <br>  Sugary stuff is not limited to candy.   Check what you eat, it may surprise you to find out how much of the stuff we eat contains sugar.  Fruits for example contain sugar (not table sugar [sucrose], but one form of it).  Anything where the ingredients are Dextrose, Fructose, High Fructose Corn Syrup; these are all sugars just "disguised" so you don't know it.  <br>  <br>  Look at the Ingredients chart on your food and remember "1 serving" is about 1/4 cup or 1 small handful.  The Carbohydrates tell you how much of what you consume is sugar and dietary fiber, but some carbs do not fall directly into these categories and are not listed except in the Total Carb count.  Sulacrose is also called Splenda and is not considered a sugar because your body does not process it, but perhaps it is still enough to cause zits.<br>  <br>  If you are eating more carbs than your body needs, while it is in its energy form, this could contribute to your problem.  <br>  <br>  Try using a preventative cream that you put on the area beforehand.  See a doctor and have him/her prescribe tetracycline or another acne medication from this family of meds.<br>  <br>  You can also use (believe it or not this is not just for women) make-up.  There is this one acne cream that one of the make-up manufacturers sells that covers up the area when applied thinly and rubbed in.  I forget what brand as it keeps rubbing off the tubes I carry but it comes in a little 1 oz green tube.|`|claUGpVRaa	It's probably a build up of oil  in your skin.<br>  It sounds girly, but seriously, after you wash (and make sure you are not using soap to wash your face - only a specific facial wash or water on it's own as soap clogs skin pores), use a cotton ball and some toner - this closes up the pores.<br>  <br>  At night, after washing, use an acne cream called Quinoderm (available over the counter at pharmacies and not expensive). It smells a bit but it is truly excellent! I have used it on odd spots since I was 13 (I am 36 now!) and always keep a tube handy as I still get spots now and then and it fixes them straight away.<br>  Seriously though, use toner to close the pores in the mornings - it will stop a lot of the usual muck from daytime getting into your pores. I guarantee you after a couple of weeks you will have huge improvements!<br>  Good luck|`|aOFdtoR4aa	WARNING!

qL96skWRaa	The specific signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis can vary with the severity of the disease. For example, one child with cystic fibrosis may have respiratory problems but not digestive problems, while another child may have both. In addition, the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis may vary with age.<br>  <br>  Signs and symptoms in newborns<br>  In some newborns, the first sign may be a blockage of their intestines (meconium ileus). This occurs when meconium — tarry, greenish-black stools normally passed by an infant during the first day or two after birth — becomes so thick it can't move through the intestines. Other signs in newborns may include:<br>  <br>      * Failure to grow<br>      * Bulky and greasy stools (steatorrhea)<br>      * Frequent respiratory infections<br>  <br>  Signs and symptoms in children and young adults<br>  Cystic fibrosis symptoms in children and young adults may include:<br>  <br>      * Salty taste to the skin. People with cystic fibrosis tend to have higher than normal amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their sweat. This may be one of the first signs parents notice because they can taste the salt when they kiss their child.<br>      * Blockage in the bowels.<br>      * Foul-smelling, greasy stools.<br>      * Delayed growth.<br>      * Thick sputum. It's easy for parents to overlook this sign because young children tend to swallow their sputum rather than cough it up.<br>      * Coughing or wheezing.<br>      * Frequent chest and sinus infections with recurring pneumonia or bronchitis.<br>      * Protrusion of part of the rectum through the anus (rectal prolapse). This is often caused by stools that are difficult to pass or by frequent coughing.<br>      * Enlargement or rounding (clubbing) of the fingertips and toes. Although clubbing eventually occurs in most people with cystic fibrosis, it also occurs in some people born with heart disease and other types of lung problems.

lPZudPkUaa	It depends on the size and strength of the doses, how it is taken (smoked, snorted, injected?) and the individual. FYI, mental dependency, feeling like you need the drug, is very different from physical addiction, where if you stop taking the drug you will experience withdrawal symptoms. <br>  <br>  With marijuana, for example, you may become mentally dependent, and you may build a tolerance (need more to get high) but there is no physical withdrawal no matter how much or how long you use it. With heroin and cocaine, withdrawal is possible and can be very severe, even life-threatening. <br>  <br>  It *is* possible to "get addicted after the first time" in that you do it once, like it, and keep doing it until you are addicted and dependent. It is also possible for someone to occasionally use the drug for years without ever becoming dependent or addicted. However, the risk of addiction is great enough that these are considered very dangerous drugs.|`|tqhr4V33aa	very!!! why would you want to put something in your body that could kill the moment you do it..|`|4Vz8lBlwaa	do some research. it's very addictive and all it takes is one time. dont they teach you about drugs in school?|`|ah59G9KVaa	Cocaine you have to do about 3-4 times close together in time like 4 days in a row and im pretty sure youll be addicted..<br>  heroin im not sure about but i think after the first time your addicted..

Those ligaments are attached to several other ligaments and muscles where they meet your pelvis, and a tug on any uterine ligament can sometimes make all the other tissues attached to the same area of the pelvis react as if *they've* been tugged at.<br>  <br>  That can cause pain that rates *really* high on the scale... but it doesn't happen to all women, and most have only some discomfort or minor to moderate pain.|`|Zgdxavnmaa	For me it feels like cramps when you try and hold it in for too long when you need the loo mixed with this like the feeling that bugs are crawling in and nibbling your insides.

Being in the position that I am, a was stuffing my face all day long just to keep going, no matter what went in! I was behind my computer 24/7.  It never worried me a lot when I was a bit younger but since I have turned the clock over Age 30 ... bang - there it was - I put on so much weight (FAT) it was just not funny anymore.<br>  <br>  I came across an excellent site which gave my direction in life back to me again. Funny that you mentioned that low calorie, low fat and low carb diets don't work.  They showed me exactly why!. Wow, what an eye-opener!  I downloaded their brand new Accelerated Fat Loss Diet immediately, and true to their promise, I ACTUALLY LOST 10 LBS IN 11 DAYS!  Now that's really not bad, and fast!<br>  <br>  Thanks to them I have now started surfing (waves), and feel like I am 23 again.  I have so much more energy and tons of confidence.

qZ23brcwaa	my brother is taking hydroxycut, and you see fast results. but of course you cant just take the pill and sit around, you do have to exercise. in a good week you can lose 3-7 pounds. i just want to say, when you get off hydroxycut, DONT stop working out and eating healthy. you WILL gain it all back if you're not careful. you have to maintain it :)<br>  <br>  anyway, you just have to do a lot of cardio. and run! you should lift some weights every now and then too though. its good for you.<br>  <br>  you dont want to over do your work outs. 45min-1 hr is enough. if you over do your workouts it just becomes pointless and can be harmful.  you might want to plan out your week to work out. for example you can work out 5 days out of the week, and leave 2 days for rest (they dont have to be back to back)<br>  <br>  keep hydrated and eat healthy. lose the soda/junk food/chips. eat some fruits and things that are good for you. <br>  <br>  goodluck
wcp7DHhvaa	Well at 1st you essentially loose weight. But as time progresses your body goes into starvation mode and you will gain weight from anything and everything. When you consistently purge you are loosing all of your nutrients and that can put you into the hospital. My advice to you would be to find another way to loose weight than to put yourself through this. <br>  Good luck!<br>  PS. There are many healthy ways to loose weight. Drink only water, if you want chocolate then eat only dark chocolate {really healthy for you}, and no eating after 7pm {there was a study that after 7pm your body works off no calories so they will be stored up as fat}. Also exercise is a very crucial part of loosing weight. Try sit ups {they give you a flatter stomach, help burn calories, and can be done in the comfort of your home}.|`|9163f6723559c34dd8054736b04c9f39aa	You probably have heard how unhealthy it is for your body to binge and purge. Aside from the damage you're doing to yourself.  There is a strong possibility that your body  will store whatever food you do manage to keep in as fat.<br>  <br>  The best way for you to lose weight, if you need to, is to eat smaller portions throughout the day, avoid eating late at night and of course exercise.  If you're body is burning more than what you're taking in you will gradually lose pounds and more importantly inches.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that weight isn't everything.  It is true that muscles weigh 2x more than fat.  Muscle will continue to burn calories even if you are at rest.  When it comes to being fit, inches count more than pounds.<br>  <br>  Build muscle (you don't have to be a body builder) and you can eat lots more of the right stuff and the good part is, you won't have to purge it out.|`|uMlxKEbUaa	Binging and purging causes your heart muscle to deteriorate. You can die in your 20s if you continue this. It also causes your teeth to look disgusting, bad breath and can cause severe digestive problems including very painful acid reflux. <br>  <br>  You can lose weight, but is it worth it if you look sickly and run the risk of dying young?<br>  <br>  You should seek counseling and maybe look into some volunteer work around your community until you're old enough to get a job.|`|eYdTRXFMaa	The obvious, of course; you lose weight.  Additionally, you damage your teeth from the acid in your mouth.  If you unbalance your electrolytes you risk damaging organs.  You will also have a very smelly breath.

NgnbtaORaa	Steam room, Sauna,  then cold room - you go from hottest to coldest.  The reason you go from hot to cold is that it purifies you skin removing all the bad bacteria by opening up, and then closing, the pores of your skin (so take a mildly cold shower after your done).  However, entering the cold room after heavy exercise will slow down your recover time, or the time it takes your heart to reach it regular rhythm, greatly.  It will be a huge shock to you system though it's a bit of a fitness trick used by boxers.  <br>  <br>  I don't know the advised time to stay in them though, sorry.  I am sure the gym attendants will inform you what the advised timings are etc if you were to ask them it's their job to know.
YoITtCbfaa	hmmm, confused.<br>  <br>  1. This is different in each person.<br>  <br>  2. It depends on the amount of shellfish eaten, and how the shellfish was prepared--kind/raw vs cooked/and the amount of the iodine (which is the usual offender in the allergy).<br>  <br>  3. As soon as the allergic reaction starts, one should TAKE THEIR EPI PEN....if you know you have a severe allergic reaction to something, do not wait for it to get worse.<br>  <br>  4. IF you KNOW YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH, do not EAT SHELLFISH.  Do not eat shellfish and then take an epipen...this is just crazy.  (I am hoping that is not what you were looking at asking....)<br>  <br>  5.  Food allergies can be scary.  Each attack can be worse then the previous.  Never play around with them.  Stages of an allergy attack?  Never heard them described in stage 1/2/3/ect...and as a paramedic, I have treated many, even one's where I could not pass an endotrachial tube into someone's throat as it was closed.<br>  <br>  6. It is NEVER too late to take epi---it just sometimes takes too long to work.....and you will be passed out/not breathing before you can get it uncapped or before you can get relief from it.  But, it is NEVER too late for the epi.....without epi during a bad attack, there is NO REVERSAL.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this answers your question.....<br>  ps---sometimes stories are exaggerated.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	The epi pen is supposed to buy you some time so you can call 911 and get to the hospital.

Sorry dude but even YOU wouldn't get leered at by strangers 24/7.  <br>  <br>  Those people on the hotline are helping you for free.  What the hell did you expect them to do, other than listen to your BS story that we here have all heard 400,000 times before?  Did you think they would offer you A Magic Solution To All Your Problems?  What are they SUPPOSED to say to people who babble on and on at them?  The responses you got are what they are trained to say.<br>  <br>  You need help.  I think you have gone from annoying to delusional.  It's probably only a matter of time before you start hearing voices in your head and seeing imaginary people.|`|vbXRz82Xaa	not and answer but greengirl i take it you have NEVER had to ring the samaritons..... oh how lucky you are!<br>  <br>  REPORTED! are you tryin g to tip this guy over the edge your being selfish and just plain nasty!
BZFmSglEaa	Ulcer is located in the upper quadrant of the GI system which is the stomach..<br>  <br>  Most popular signs for ulcer is burning pain sensation in the stomach area.<br>  <br>  Blood in stool usually indicates possible early warning signs of cancer so I would get that checked out IMMEDIATELY!<br>  <br>  The question you have to ask your uncle if the blood has been chronic or acute?<br>  <br>  Chronic means the red blood has been noticeable for a while and acute means recently you've noticed the symptoms.

Seriously.  and I am deathly afraid that while driving my tire is going to fall off, or someone else's tire will come off and I will get into a major car accident. I say a little prayer every time I get in the car. I've never had this happen or seen it happen. I've been told that it is very rare for a tire to just come off. But you never know right?<br>  <br>  As for the cows and turkeys...I have no idea where this came from. I can see them on tv and stuff. My head knows that a baby cow is not threat at all.

I can't control it though and i don't even know where this fear has come from. Recently i got a hole in my tooth and was told i would need a filling, which would take 2 hours, so instead i decided to go under anesthetic and get it removed.<br>  <br>  Its irrational i know, but something i just cannot control. Weird.|`|q5OJURtbaa	I'm scared of shadows in water. I'm convinced that there are sharks in shadows. Even in pools! I know it's completely irrational, yet unless i can be in a well lit portion of water, I freak out run to get out. <br>  <br>  Once, my ex and I were walking across seriously about a 5 inch deep stream, the water started to cloud up and my sandle got stuck in the mud. I ended up falling backwards and was 7 mos pregnant at the time, he tried to make me walk without my sandles and I freaked out cause I couldn't see through the water and didn't want to step down. I had to stand on his feet while he walked us the rest of the way across... mind you I was 25 years old at the time too. <br>  <br>  It's completely imbarrassing, but yeah, those are my irrational fears.
9lT4e8Efaa	This is a pretty good days worth of eating if your dieting... if not try to add more protein, i know your a vegetarian (as am I), how about veggie alternatives? theres so many types out there now! Or how about a lovely nut roast? full of protein! but if your trying to lose weight this is a good choice of meals x|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	sounds healthy & flavorful. plus u get all those vitamins &nutrients from appetite supressor drink, its like lunch in a can. w/tofu, u r getting calcium, just like w/the activia. those r god replacements for heavy dairy stuff like ice cream, etc.|`|M1PYqC3qaa	The food that you are eating is very healthy indeed :)<br>  However, unless you are looking to lose a lot of weight, you could do with eating a bit more.<br>  Why not throw a couple of healthy snacks in there. It could just be fruit, or yoghurt - just something!<br>  Btw I'm veggie too, I know how some people find that so hard to accept lol. But tofu is a good source of protein, and you can get iron from leafy green vegetables!|`|fc5c0507db7f5b77389a61a92ae3cf1faa	it's actually quite good, however you need to add more fruits and veggies to your diet (they are fat free and low calorie, yet very filling and full of vitamins!)<br>  Also, you probably need more calories, at leat 1800 a day and dinner couldn't have had more than 500-800 calories, which puts you 300-700 calories to short. By adding more fruits and veggies as well as perhaps a little more protein and whole grain products (like adding oatmeal flakes to your yogurt in the morning) you'll have a healthy diet<br>  <br>  PS, I'm also vegetarian|`|U6C4Bywwaa	sounds good although a little low cal. I will guess that dinner is no more than 350 cals, most likely less. Maybe add a couple snacks but oherwise very healthy stuff?|`|NRfs81Raaa	Seems like you are currently not eating enough protein with your overall calorie intake. This can be very complicated to figure out, but without protein, your body will not be able to repair muscles properly after exercise or even normal daily activity. This is important because muscle burns fat. <br>  <br>  There is a formula for figuring out the right balance in each of your meals and it takes some diligence to figure out how to eat good balanced meals. <br>  <br>  I just published a blog post on eating balanced meals and it might be worth it for you to look at it for more detail. I would post it here but it is about 1500 words.<br>  <br>  You are just fine in getting your protein from beans, dairy, grains, etc. you just need to be sure you are getting enough. Typically, vegans end up eating high carb diets because they are not able to balance them well with enough proteins and fats.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|eVk8yPy2aa	No you need to be eating 2000 calories a day so your not eating enough|`|T0gS8uUtaa	I think its well balanced :)<br>  well done

OleVPkJgaa	yeah you do, most likely. You have a headache because your sinuses are clogged up and infected with a (its going to sound real gross right here) thick, heavy mucus. You need a decongestant like Advil Cold & Sinus real quick and then you'll be pretty snotty for a few days but it will slowly go from thick green to thinner yellow to almost watery clear and then you're all better!!
BkN7q0hgaa	It is going to be hard because you are recovering from a disorder.  It all starts with changing the way you think about food and yourself.  It sounds to me you are still obsessing about gaining, part of recovery.  I understand I have been there, many years ago.  I opted to get healthy, and since you used recovery in your question, I see you are too and congrats to you.  It seems like a lot of food at first because you have deprived yourself for so long due to the eating disorder.  If the food you are putting into your body is healthy, you will gain weight, but healthy weight.  When this happened to me I opted to get out of that negative way of thinking  about food (I realize easier said than done), but after I gained it back, I started to exercise (not over doing it) and feel good and healthy about me.  You can do it to.  You just need to love yourself and be positive and strong.  I do not know you, but I hope you can pull through this.  Find the strength in yourself to recover and you can help others in the same situation.<br>  Take care and be strong :)|`|XZqSO94saa	Probably not enough. I had to have way more during weight-gain from an eatting disoder including high calorie fequent snack's.<br>  For you're 250 calorie snack I would reccomend "Ensure". It's a nutritional shake supplement which I took as the snack. And it's exactly 250 calories with 26 nutrient's and omega 3 + 6.<br>  <br>  Hope i'v helped.<br>  And best of luck in recovery! Stay strong!|`|DYQfxTl2aa	This is nowhere near enough food but if you haven't been eating then it's a good start. The Okinawa food triangle has seven times the amount of fruit and veg as the western diet and they are skinny people. They eat lots of fruit, veg,herbs and spices which help metabolism, especially chilly. They also drink lots of green tea and miso soup with seaweed, these drinks are jam packed full of goodness,help digestion and balance hormones. Eat lots of seafood, just grill, boil or steam, even stir-fry, no batter or deep fry, and do not eat fish with egg or milk, the tibetans say it poisons the system. if you really love mornays use coconut milk. in the last week I have heard on the radio that the powers of nutrition came to the conclusion that milk is good for people who want to lose weight, mainly because protein fills you up for longer and there are nutrients that are more useful than fat is harmful, apparently it counteracts the fat, so there you go, good ole milk. there is a book called the food pharmacy, and the okinawa way is awesome, the more you learn about food the better you will feel, and the more you will enjoy eating. also look up the french paradox, they do eat choc eclairs, croissants and full cream dairy every day and they have beautiful bodies, olive oil and red wine are to thank for this, you don't have to get pissed you can buy resveratrol in a bottle. eat and drink and be merry.|`|85KL0eUUaa	um i'm guessing you've been eating less than 600 calories each day<br>  up the amount to 1500, then after 2 weeks to 2000, try to have some junk each day<br>  start swimming and yoga to gain muscle, so you won't be flabby<br>  and if you are eating more and doing a strength-excersise, you should gain about 10lb in the next month<br>  don't go higher than 125.
QPbnFJGKaa	You don't want to burn calories, you are dangerously underweight.  Your personal trainer knows what he/she is doing, don't doubt them.  Since you are recovering from an eating disorder, you don't have the right mindset when it comes to the difference of being at a healthy weight and being underweight.  I am sure you are in good hands, if it's really bothering you then go to your doctor and voice your concerns.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	five eight and 110 = waaaaaaay too thin.

Advertise your practice on the side of it, then drive up and down the streets etc. Test it out first at your nearest trailer park though.|`|AROX6og0aa	No. They would take you more seriously if you had a briefcase full of cash.   You could look at all the "verchina's" you want if you had a briefcase full of cash.<br>  <br>  (They only like doctors because they think docs make big bucks.)|`|gT74D0Ggaa	Oh god no, please don't!

Be mobile. Go to them. They can be shy sometimes.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Nope. I'm way more comfy in a garage...the smell of motor oil, etc. is really quite calming. Keep your office where it's at.

ZxOGKZOkaa	My husband and I get this too.  It's like some sort of vapor lock.  It really hurts.  When you drink, you also chug down some air and it all gets caught and works its way down.  Then you usually burp or have gas later.|`|K26ec4kLaa	Drinking too much too fast could maybe cause a bubble and this would give you this uncomfortable feeling.. Also, there are digestive problems also that could be at the bottom of it.  You don't mention food, only drink.. If you're very thirsty ALL the time, then you might want to be tested for diabetes as this is one of the symptoms> excessive thirst.. If not, just try to remember to drink slower and if this worsens, see your doctor..
K26ec4kLaa	Hmm, could be the start of appendicitis, or even just possibly a minor virus.  If it lasts much longer or gets more painful, see your doctor to get it checked out..

My skin is clear and I'm sticking to this treatment.|`|FPITkq7yaa	I would stick to mineral makeup that will not cause further irritation. If you get a powder, mixing it with a moisturiser will help it to blend over drier patches. As for what kind, to be honest all any moisturiser will do is help keep your skin lubricated, none will be a cure. Dont bother with expensive creams, a good, thick sorbolene or similar will work as well as any other. A trick to help seal in more moisture is to apply a thin layer of oil over the top of any cream, especially at night. I have had some success with a client with psoriasis using Lemon Myrtle essential oil. Try adding a few drops to whatever cream/oil you use. Keep a small bottle of olive oil in the shower and apply after washing. Rinse off and you should be left with a layer of oil that will trap in the moisture from the water. <br>  HTH|`|AA12358000	I'm ranina,<br>  You will have to experiment with the makeups and find one that suits you. I realise that this sounds unhelpful, but each person has a different reaction to make up, and especially someone with psoriasis. With regard to the moisturiser, you would be advised to use any moisturiser, and often. You may find that one with no perfume may suit you better, but on the whole, frequent applications of moisturiser will be benificial. Between 4 to 6 times daily or when you consider that the last application has really dried out. Apply directly after a bath or shower and the moisture absorbed by your body will remain in the skin under the moisturiser. Apply over any crusts, do not remove them. There is an ointment - prescription only - that has proved to be quite effective with some sufferers of psoriasis vulgaris and it is Tacalcitol (Bonalfa).

It took about2 1/2 months after last treatment for the hair on my head to start growing back, eyebrows and eyelashes took about 3-4 weeks.

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	Proud Mama, I know it's hard, but please try to remain calm. As you have stated, the odds of your daughter having CF are very -- and I repeat --  very low. Especially since your other children do not have this disease.<br>  <br>  When my youngest son was 9 weeks old, he had the sweat test for CF. All they do is place a plastic "capture cup" on the child's arm, and wait just a short period of time to collect some sweat. They will then test this sample, and, depending on the lab and time of day, be able to present the results in just a few hours.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons why a child would have low weight gain, and the vast majority are very treatable. Your doctor has probably ordered the sweat test to *rule out* CF rather than confirm it. <br>  <br>  My own child had the test performed due to a bout of the respiratory synsychial virus (RSV) and repeated vomiting of his feedings. Along with the sweat test, he was given an upper GI. The basis for these tests was to learn whether his vomiting and low weight gain was due to CF, asthma, or acid reflux. Also, there was the possibility that he had aspirated vomitus, and this was causing his raspy breathing and vomiting.  <br>  <br>  The final diagnosis was asthma, and once we began treatment, his health improved almost immediately. He is now a healthy, happy teenager who towers over me, his 2 older brothers, and practically everyone else.<br>  <br>  I understand the anguish you are experiencing, and I am sorry for you. Please try to keep a positive attitude, for yourself, and for your children.  My thoughts are with you and your family. <br>  <br>  Information on CF can be found at the following links. While the information may seem scary, please understand that, if your daughter does test positive, there are new and effective treatments available to help her live a long, productive life. All is not lost.<br>  <br>  Only the best to you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.yahoo.com/respiratory-overview/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/healthwise--hw188550.html">http://health.yahoo.com/respiratory-over...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cff.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cff.org/</a>
EeTs9DqUaa	There are several variations of type 2 diabetes, the fasting test does not screen for all of them.  He should ask for a OGTT Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, it starts as a fasting test, then he drinks a 75 mg drink.  They will then test several times over the next 2-3 hours to see how his body handles the glucose load.  If you have access to a glucose meter, test him after eating a crab heavy meal, at one and two  hours after eating.  <br>  <br>  Also what he needs to do is reduce and watch his carb intake, sugar is one carb, there are several others he needs to watch for.  White foods, flour, bread, potatoes, rice, milk, bakery goods, bagels and pasta are all carbs that need to be eaten in moderation.  The problem is what is usually sold as a "healthy diet" is not healthy for diabetics.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.|`|HPpdcAtAaa	South. Beach. Diet.  Best diet ever.

5KCfpwgjaa	My mom has MS and one thing I have learned about this disease is everyone is different.  Stress is the one thing someone with MS needs to stay away from that seems to always cause problems to start with my mom.  She has had MS for almost 4 years and her husband walked out and left her right after that she stopped walking but she is working on getting that back.  Another thing that I have been told is most people improve over time because it takes a while to find the right meds for each person.  If you (or whomever with MS) feels your meds are not doing their best talk to your Dr and find something that will work.  It is very common to change your meds until you find the right one.

P544Sbmqaa	If you donate actual marrow, it will be done under general anesthesia, or at the very least with an epidural. You will be sore for up to a couple weeks after, but you arent going to feel them taking the marrow. <br>  <br>  If you could feel it, its horrible. Bone marrow biopsies are done the same way, just on a far smaller scale, and with local anesthesia only. There really isnt anything I can compare it to. Even though the marrow is fluid, its more like a tissue. When you pull out the marrow, its kind of the equivalent of cutting off a peice of skin. Its taken from the hip, and during the biopsies I can feel it pulling all the way from the tip of my toe through my leg and up through my hip.  However, marrow donation is on a far larger scale than biopsies, and donation is done under anesthesia.<br>  <br>  However, most donations today are peripheral blood stem cells. Hemaopoetic stem cells (the type of cell in the marrow that allows the transplant to work) are also found in the circulating blood. PBSCs are taken using aphersis, which is no big deal. The worst part there is gaining veinous access with a larger than normal needle. If you have ever been to the plasma center or done like a double red cell donation, its the same process, except its a different type of cell being collected.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marrow.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.marrow.org</a> is the National Marrow Donors Program for the US and can give you info. If you are in a different country, search for your country's marrow program or call the US registry for info for your country. In the UK, its the Anthony Nolan Trust, but I dont have that website offhand.<br>  <br>  When you sign up you will get some blood tests, fill out a medical history survey and thats it.  If you are ever called, you will get some more blood work, go through some physical examinations and have a detailed medical history taken to make sure you are healthy enough to donate.  If selected to donate after all that, it can usually be set up for you to donate at a local hospital.<br>  <br>  The US registry costs 50$ to sign up.  The registry is a federally funded program, and the fee is to help offset the costs of tissue typing, which costs around several hundred dollars.|`|AA11404443	I can't donate because I had Lymphoma cancer but I urge you to be a donor because so many people could be saved if more people were registered.  I have had a bone marrow biopsy once and it did not hurt that bad, they give you a shot to relax you and another shot to numb the spot where they are doing the biopsy.  It feels weird but I was not in excruciating pain.  I just read a MAYO clinic article that said new technology filters it out of your blood so no sugurey.|`|CNkGM3ELaa	I personally havent heard of them taking it from your blood. im not sure if i beleive that because the bone marrow is inside your bones.

b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	When I was 20, I found out I was hypoglycemic.  I'm adopted, and that was back in the 60's when it was not required to give any kind of medical background from the parents, so I have no idea whether or not diabetes ran in my biological family.  The good news is, after two years of taking care of myself, including cutting waaaay back on the drinking, I never tested hypoglycemic again.  It can happen.  If you take good care of yourself, your body might straighten itself out.  I don't know why your body can't stabilize itself the day after drinking--all I can tell you is, maybe you'd better quit.  <br>  <br>  If you become pregnant, you might or might not have more problems.  No one can say until it happens.  You might go the other way and find yourself with gestational diabetes...but if you do everything your doctor tells you to do, after the baby is born, you'll be fine.  All I can tell you is this:  do as much research on reputable websites as you possibly can, and don't let the things people tell you here on YA be your only information.  There's a reason why this is called YAHOO answers....because we're all just a bunch of yahoos answering questions!|`|AA12109796	alcohol lowers your blood sugar. if you drink you must eat something with it. or e.g. have with a sugary mixer e.g. vodka and coke (full sugar). else you will go hypo.<br>  <br>  chicken doesnt contain much sugar or carb. it wont raise your blood sugar enough. have some fast acting carb (e.g. sugar) followed by some slower acting carbs instead of chicken.|`|wTihIKnyaa	drinking is probably the cause of it actually.

There was a fire in the apartment complex across from hers and she ran outside to check it out.  As she was walking down the stairs to get a better view, balls came out! There were plenty of people around. True story!

A girl gets a period because 'she's ;shedding' the blood coushoning her uterine walls for the baby that wasn't produced during the previous month, this 'shedding' also flushes out the egg (single cell, not a chicken or bird egg).  If a baby is produced, the coushoning stays, protecting the zygote, which turns into the baby that your gf'll be popping out in another 3 months if she's on time.  Just a note:  If you don't like blood or faint at the sight of it, stay OUT of the birthing room.|`|fhhqFgJuaa	Why not take advice from a Dock?|`|5vgnrvcmaa	I hope you're only kidding.<br>  <br>  The blood from a period is what was to be used by an egg if it had been fertilized.

xRQAsGRAaa	Ab work outs will not make you lose stomach fat. I can't tell you how many people have come to me saying they want a 6-pack, and ask what ab work outs I recommend.<br>  To lose stomach fat, you have to do cardio. The stomach fat is by far the hardest to get rid of. The fastest way to do this, will take you more than a month(depending how much stomach fat you have).<br>  Run at least 30 minutes a day, for 4-5 days a week. You have to get your metabolism up, and burn calories. Running is the best way to do both of these. <br>  Once you get your stomach fat down, THEN you do ab work outs.<br>  Upper abs- crunches, sit ups, speed crunches<br>  Lower abs- 6 inches, leg raises, leg scissors<br>  Side abs- lay on your side, and do a "side crunch".<br>  "Ab killers"- lay on your back, and draw the numbers 1-10 with your legs. Draw them in the air, but remember to keep your legs straight, and your hands under your butt.

rbuBNDJbaa	Autoimmune Diseases <br>   <br>   <br>  The immune system is essential to survival, and even a modest decrease in immune function can leave a person susceptible to infection. But the immune system itself can also cause disease, by inappropriately attacking the body’s own organs, tissues, or cells.<br>  <br>  More than 80 autoimmune diseases have been described to date. Some, such as type 1 diabetes, attack specific organs, while others, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), involve multiple organs<br>  <a href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/autoimmune/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/autoimm...</a>|`|CHiEKZrLaa	In short...  Autoimmune (AI) disorders/diseases occur when your body fails to recognize "self" as "self."<br>  <br>  Your immune system mistakes your healthy cells as "foreign" and mounts an immune defense against them.  Medical science has not yet identified precisely WHY this happens... they can be "triggered" by a viral infection or another illness, or they can be "idiopathic" (meaning we have no idea why it started.)  Typically (though not always) there are periods of remission and periods where the condition will flare up.  All these things together explain why AI conditions can be really challenging to treat.<br>  <br>  Examples of systemic AI disease include:  SLE/Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis.  There are organ-specific examples, too... such as Type 1 Diabetes where the immune system destroys the islet cells in the pancreas.<br>  ---------------------<br>  Hey Andy - got your message...<br>  <br>  AI conditions can arise at any age, from infancy through elderly.  They tend to be more common in women (suspected cause is women's somewhat more complicated endocrine systems.)<br>  <br>  Symptoms depend entirely on what tissue/organ/body part/system the AI condition attacks.  Sorry I can't be more specific.  Google a few of the diseases I listed and you'll get a good symptom picture for each.<br>  <br>  Cheers!  And good luck with what I suspect is a homework assignment.  ;)

gr4IFLsMaa	Medications like paliperidone (Invega) increase the appetite in part because of the brain chemicals that the medication affects.  The increased appetite results in increased food consumption which of course in turn leads to increased weight.  There are methods that can be taken.  Following a regular diet and exercise is the first measure of defense.  Another option (do google searches) is adding a medication called metformin (Glucophage) to help counteract antipsychotic weight gain.  Another option that I know could be done (though not commonly used because of the drugs side effects) could be adding Topamax.  Topamax is a medication that is used for seizures and prevention of migraines but can also decrease the appetite which could make you eat less.  This could result in some weight loss.  Weight loss was found to be a side effect of Topamax, but like I said, there were found to be side effects with Topamax.  I hope I've help explained your question and possible options to help.  Best of luck in your treatment choices...|`|574e07f32c5e0329b5d67b84a68f75faaa	Most antipsychotics cause weight gain. Some are worse than others.<br>  Olanzapine and Clozapine are the worst.<br>  Risperidone is a medium effect (paliperidone is a lot like it)<br>  Aripiprazole and Ziprazidone have less.<br>  <br>  The pills do not contain any callories. The reason for weight gain is not clear but is probably due to a number of factors: it may effect how your body metabolises it's callories (ie slowly so they get stored) and also it may be by making people too tired to excercise.<br>  <br>  Olanzapine is famous for causing a big increase in appetite which adds to these factors.|`|6TVAut8naa	All antipsychotic medicine will provoke your metabolism, because this are chemichals that tear up your insides.<br>  <br>  You eat more cause your nervesystem is put to sleep, so that you can`t register when you are full as well as you used to.<br>  <br>  The best cure for schizofrenia is acupunktur, massage/aromatherapi, reflexologi and phisical exercise.<br>  Together with rest.<br>  Rest is required only togheter with this therapi forms, cause you release<br>  great amount of energi while being psychotic, and therefor movement is recomended.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you decide to change therapi metods to the alternative ones, you need to do this very slowly, maybe a period of to three month`s.

I've taken several different antipsychotics over the last couple months (all at low doses, I know next to nothing about taking them over time)  for Tourette's, and I have to say this: good luck.  I had bad reactions to them, so if it feels wrong to you....if something freaky happens, you need to call your doctor right away.

yHHdAMnQaa	Yes you do have anixety disorder|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	noone on Y!A can diagnose you with anxiety, you need to see a dr about this.|`|kFAuL2Hraa	I would say that you do have an anxiety disorder. <br>  <br>  But trying to diagnose yourself will only make it worse.<br>  <br>   So therefore, you should see a doctor or psychiatrist. It has helped me before.|`|AA10112244	I know your history by now. You are only 14, and you can't possibly diagnose yourself here ar anywhere else.<br>  You are too young , and you are probably anxious, because you are trying to hide your eating disorder.<br>  You say now that you were diagnosed with anorexia and bulimic tendencies. Before you said your parents did not know about it. I told you before that even if you think they don;t know, it is not that easy to hide all these months. That alone can make you anxious. Again, you are too young to even try and diagnose yourself. You need help, and Yahoo answers is not the way to go. You MUST talk to someone who can help you NOW. Your constant tiredness, sweating, etc, has to do with your body telling you that you are not treating it right. These symptoms are a serious warning, and you should listen to your body.|`|uYz8ipcJaa	Only a pro can diagnose you correctly, but to me (I have anxiety disorder) you sound like you have it.<br>  <br>  Anxiety is fear... if you worry too much about things other people may not worry about too much, and that worrying interferes with what you are doing, you have the disorder.<br>  <br>  For example.<br>  One sort of anxiety I have is social anxiety.  I have difficulty talking to people, answering phones, bringing up things, facing problems.  That obviously interferes with school, work, relationships and life in general.<br>  Another anxiety I have is anxiety related to perfectionism.  I sweat over grades and scores and being compared to others.  I freak out if I get an A-, and when I am told to go someplace at a designated time I have to re-check the time and place over and over and over and over so I won't make a mistake.  Because I am afraid to try new things and make a mistake I never act when I need to and I often procrastinate.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself,<br>  What kind of feelings or moods do you have usually?<br>  Are you afraid of some things? What are they?<br>  Do you think your friends or family will be afraid of whatever you're anxious about too to your degree?<br>  Is that fear preventing you from doing things you want to do, performing at your top level, getting good grades and otherwise?  How?<br>  Do you want to get rid of your anxiety?<br>  <br>  If you feel mostly anxious, afraid, apprehensive, defensive, depressed... and your feelings are irrational (if you live in the midst of war, anxiety is probably less a "disorder," but if you don't and most other people seem happy then it's more likely a "disorder")... and your anxiety is inconvenient to you, you probably have anxiety disorder.<br>  <br>  If you want to get rid of it, or if it's leading into physical problems, deep depression, suicidal thoughts, other complications (eating disorders is one)...<br>  <br>  See a counselor.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	eat less, move more..that's as about as simple as it gets<br>  3500 cals = 1 lb<br>  so if you decrease your daily cals by 500, you'd lose about a pound per week.........<br>  MORE if you exercise

K26ec4kLaa	Well, if you've had it before, you should kinda know the answer, but here goes.. Anything with acid, like ketchup, spagetti sauce etc would be a no no.  I hope you were to the doctor and are on an antibiotic.  Also, drinking cool fluids like cool water and gargling with a bit of salt in it can help.. Even honey in tea.  Just avoid spicy foods and eat bland things.  Feel Better Soon|`|z6mbVz8maa	Some people think that lemon juice is good because of vitamin c. It is wrong, because lemon juice will make worse. Eat only soft foods like cream of wheat with water not milk. Avoid dairy-dairy products produce  mucus which is food for bacteria...no nuts. Apple sauce, oats  w/water. Take supplement of vit c.<br>  You may also read in: God's Medicine Is Best by Linda Wise, heard it is a great book.

f8mLpPXlaa	No paper robes but they do insist that you have no metal on you. You're going to be in a strong magnetic field and they don't want  things flying around.  The worst thing about an MRI, at least for me, was a momentary feeling of claustrophobia. It passes rather quickly but it's something you'll remember. All you have to do is lay there close your eyes and don't move. You'll hear a couple of loud noises but that's normal. And before you know it it's over. It's a strange experience but you'll see, perfectly harmless.<br>  Ask the tech if you can see the images. It'll blow your mind.<br>  And the actual time you spend in the machine is 5-10 minutes.Tops.|`|eUFsTmlsaa	It depends...I had an MRI on my foot last year and it took about 20 minutes but since you had a concusion it might take a little longer since its your head and stuff and they just want to make sure everythings ok :)...and no you don't have to wear a robe:) at least i didn't hope this helps|`|NaCLfRDCaa	My wife has had several brain MRI's and they can take any where from 30 to 45 minutes 60 at the most.

ljVwo5qZaa	If your friend is under the age of 21 he's a complete idot for taking PH's. Even though they're legal, they act the exact same as a steriod. Get him off that sh*t and make sure he has a good PCT to get his boys up and running again. Let me guess, he's using Epistane?<br>  <br>  To get your bench up, work on your legs. Your body grows proportionally and if you don't do legs then your bench and everything else will lag behind. If you do a full body workout and the bench isn't going up then increase your food intake to increase your body weight. This should help to increase your strength in all exercises. Also try working in different rep ranges like 5-8 reps for power. If you have a "sticking point" then do some work to get past that.<br>  <br>  Protein: Pro-Nos is a good protein but overpriced IMO. I love All the Why protein. Isolate is my choice b/c i'm lactose intolerant but their blend is also good. Check out Nutraplanet.com to see their prices on 5lb jugs.
510MC9SVaa	My son was DX with ADHD also. First, know it isn't the end of the world. With proper guidance ADHD can be a great assett. He will be able to multitask as an adult and keep up with all the different things easily.<br>  <br>  I tried everything with my son (even drugs) until I finally found the token economy system. Look up the token economy and try that with both kids. It worked wonderfully for my family. We don't have to nag him to do things anymore. He does what he knows he is supposed to do when it is supposed to be done. <br>  <br>  We included "attitude" as one of the things he had to work on. That way if he got nasty with us or refused to do his job we had a consequence ready. <br>  <br>  The way our's is set up he has a list of things he needs to do every day. Feed animals, Take out trash, brush teeth 2x a day, brush hair, change clothes, take a bath, do classwork (he is homeschooled), clean room, attitude. For all but attitude he gets one point if he does the stuff without having to be prompted. If we have to tell him to do the stuff then he gets 1/2 point. For attitude, if he gets attitude with us he gets a nice warning. If he gets attitude again that day he doesn't get the attitude points. Attitude is worth 5 points because it is more important to us. <br>  <br>  We have a dry erase chart we use to keep up with the point system and he is allowed to cash in points for prizes. There are prizes that are worth 5 points (1$ prizes) all the way up to major prizes. We all sat down together to set up the system and to set up the prize list. We also review the system on a regular basis to make sure it is still meeting everyone's needs.<br>  <br>  This system saves us so much heartache and frustration it is amazing. We don't have to nag him anymore, he very rarely gets attitude, he normally does his basic things with no issues.

Among its homoeostatic functions are acid-base balance, regulation of electrolyte concentrations, control of blood volume, and regulation of blood pressure. <br>  The kidneys accomplish these homoeostatic functions independently and through coordination with other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system.

6wW7iLrbaa	You will not gain muscle mass from doing this as it is low intensity My advice for you is for you to do small bursts of high intesity followed by rest.

E64juLwJaa	There are two hormones:testosterone and estrogen.<br>  Male and female hormones<br>  Your hormones are regulated bu your owen body:you have no control over that.<br>  Pheromones are substances that attract other persons to you in a sexual kind of way.<br>  And no you cannot increase your pheromones because the effects they have depend on other persons.<br>  Planets.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Just look up the words in WebMD.com.  Hormones are chemicals that regulate your body's development and function.  Testosterone in particular, manufactured in your testicles, is what turns you from a boy into a man as you grow up, beginning with puberty.  Pheromones are chemicals that produce a scent that attracts others and turns them on to you.  No, you can't control how much you make of either chemical or how strong they are.  Some colognes supposedly contain artificial pheromones, however.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	Both are chemicals produced by the body that communicates information.  Hormones used the bloodstream as the communication channel to convey the message.  They are produced by specials glands.  For example the adrenal glands produce adrenalin.  Adrenalin makes the body adjust to sudden change in the environment.  Other hormones are gender specific.  The male's testes produce produce testosterone.  Testosterone are carried in the bloodstream and sends information about to the body to develop male traits, etc.  <br>  <br>  Pheromones are chemicals emitted by the body and other people are supposed to subconsciously respond to them.  For example people respond to the pheromone  of another person and this is manifested in the form of sexual attraction.|`|AA11707728	Hormones....well, I could write a textbook on what hormones are and what they do.  If you really care, wikipedia has a decent introduction.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormones" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormones</a><br>  <br>  But what you really want to know is about pheromones in humans for purposes of attracting women.  Short answer.  There is no way to legitimately increase your own pheromone production.  Take it from me.  I have alot of experience with pheromones.  I have alot of experienec with various techniques for increasing related hormones like testosterone (for weight lifting).  It's tough to increase your hormones and impossible to increase your pheromones.<br>  <br>  Luckily, it is easy to get the effect you are looking for by just spraying on synthetic pheromones.  Unlike trying to do it naturally, this works very well for attracting women.  Unfortunately, there are alot of scam artists that sell fake pheromones.  There are two good sources for these that I know of.....Love Scent and Androtics Direct.  Love Scent sells most of the legitimate pheromone brands.  Androtics Direct sells its own brand but pretty much make the best available.  For about $12, you could get a small bottle of their Ammunition cologne product and see for yourself what a good pheromone product does.  Just be sure to not wear too much.  Wearing too much can cause the effect to stop, especially if you are young.  One spray, maybe two.  There is about 40 sprays in the bottle.  Plenty to test this stuff out without risking too much money.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.androticsdirect.com/product.php?productid=114&cat=12&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.androticsdirect.com/product.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to know more about pheromones, read the Pherotalk Forum, especially the sticky posts at the top of the Men's Forum:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pheromonetalk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pheromonetalk.com/</a>|`|gktVbcEnaa	Hormones are chemicals that stimulate your body.

AA11693263	Unfortunately if you already knew you had the flu and there weren't any breathing or any other complications involved then yeah, you pretty much did go for no reason. There is no medication that can cure the flu. You can get medications to help you feel better like cough medication and medication for fever and pain and sore throat and runny nose, etc. The only time a doctor can really help with anything that has to do with the flu is if you develop respiratory problems, like asthma, bronchitis, something like that. Or are dehydrated because of the fever and not getting enough liquids. Just chalk this one up to lesson learned and next time know that getting some Advil for the pain and fever,and Musinex will help you feel better. I am on day 4 of the flu and I am just drinking as much as I can to keep myself hydrated and the mucus  (I know gross) thin and Advil for my headaches, body aches and fever that still hasn't broken yet.

u9I9jjF5aa	First of all:  If he doesn't respect the fact that you don't want to have sex, you need to dump him.  He doesn't respect you and you need to get out of that relationship.<br>  <br>  Second, the first time hurts for some women, I'm sorry to say.  If you're wanting your first time with a man to be easier, wait untill you're sure you want to do it and if he's allright with not being able to break your hymen (that's the part that makes it hurt the most for most girls), get yourself as worked up and horney as you can in private - or if you're comfortable enough, let him watch - and pretend a toy that's about his size lengthwise, perhaps smaller widthwise, is him like you have with your current toy and b/f.  Push it SLOWLY all the way in.  This should at least tear your hymen so it's more comfortable with him.  Don't pull the toy out immediately, let it stay where it is untill any pain or stinging or soreness is gone, then if you want, move the toy slowly untill you're used to the feel of it and it doesn't hurt.  <br>  <br>  If he does have a problem with not being the one to break your hymen, then during the first time, get yourself worked up and horney, or even better have him do it, and then when it's time, have him push slowly in and then wait inside untill it doesn't hurt anymore.  Then he can move slow and without too much power to his thrusts untill you're sure there isn't any pain.  <br>  <br>  And lastly, if it's your first time, it's all about YOU.  If you want it missionary, then tell him that he can **** off otherwise.  For a girl, loosing your virginity is usually an event, while for him, loosing his virginity, it's just getting something out of the way.  If he can't deal with it being important to you, then you shouldn't be dating a jerk.<br>  <br>  Sorry if this answer is TMI, but for something like this, it's a little important to be graphic.  I hope this helps.|`|g8EViy1Raa	Erm, if you're on top you're in control of depth of penetration so it's less likely to hurt than him on top of you.|`|FQxUpc9baa	tell him u want to start off w/ him on top and go from there if it's still a no then he really don't want none|`|u9RwzLPnaa	Missionary is the most boring position ever invented.

There is a position in which people do it sideways. Not sure what it's called but it looks interesting.<br>  <br>  Hows that for TMI :)|`|H2IqzG12aa	No need to apologize.  The other info helps with the answer.  Your boyfriend doesn't know what to do, isn't sure what goes where, that's why he wants you to initiate it and do all the work.  And with you on top, for him it's more like him masturbating in bed, which he's probably more comfortable with for now.<br>  <br>  As for your experiments with sex toys, they're not the same as the real thing in many ways.  Don't judge one by the other.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, neither of you is ready for sex.  Wait until you're both comfortable with the idea and it just happens when the time is right.

My husband intimidated me, made fun of me in front of family and friends and made me feel worthless.  I stopped seeing my friends, had no social life what so ever because this man made me feel so unimportant.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that kept me going was my daughter.  12 years into our marriage and I finally found the strength to say to him that I wanted to seperate "Merry ******* Christmas" was his reply.<br>  <br>  But I did it, I left him, took my daughter with me, who was 10 years old at this point.<br>  <br>  It broke her heart to leave her daddy, and so subsequently it broke mine, the sleepless nights we spent with her cradled in my arms sobbing her heart out was almost enough for me to get back together with him.  I felt selfish.... how could I have torn my little girl's world apart just for my own happiness?  But as my mum said to me, for her to grow up in a loveless household would have only taught her that that was what a marriage should be.  I didn't want that, I wanted her to know what it was to see me happy and maybe one day with a man I truely love.<br>  <br>  2 years on and it's still quite tough, my daughter still gets upset when she comes home to me from spending the weekend with her dad and so do I still get upset when I see her cry.

Please don't take this lightly.  Asthma attacks can be deadly.<br>  <br>  Once you get your attacks under control, definitely seek out natural remedies to help manage your asthma.  Vitamin C, citrus and kiwi fruits are used traditionally in nutritional therapy to reduce the severity and frequency of asthma attacks.

Shortness of breath was reduced by 32%, severe wheeze by 41%, night time cough by 27%, chronic cough by 25%, and runny nose by 28%."<br>  <br>  Also, there is a lot of information about the rise in childhood asthma coming out of autism research.

(not exaggerating) i had to go to the er to get a shot to bring the swelling down so my throat wouldn't close in my sleep. Also, my lower abdomen hurt, it was tender to the touch. And i had a fever the entire time. If you think you have mono, you should go get tested now. Because with my doc. they did the rapid test, but it came back neg. and i had to wait until the blood results came back from the lab before he even put me on antibiotics. And if you are still in school, be prepared for a possible home bound  teacher.

PiXZBqWkaa	I had a bridge fitted privately about 3 years ago. The total cost of treatment, including the original extraction, was about ￡1200. After the extraction I was advised to wait for about 3 months before having the bridge fitted. This was to allow time for the gum to shrink back. The bridge tooth was then made to fit the gap, and fits high into the gum. While I was waiting I wore a temporary bridge. Not particularly comfortable, but it filled the gap (my bridge is right at the front).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|6xEpscamaa	You can wait less time to have the bridge put in.  Probably aroun 2 months for the gums to heal up.  A implant will probably need at least 6 months for the bone to become solid.  A bridge may cost around 2500-3500.  An implant will be around $4000.  Ask your dentist.  In implant would be preferable because you don't ruin two perfectly good teeth to fill in the gap.

If you want to exercise, jog in place in your room and do high intensity intervals (jog in place for 2 min, then do 1 min of jumping jacks or push ups or jump-squats, you can vary the exercise.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|5cbILl1caa	exercises won't make u see them<br>  <br>  your abs are hidden under belly fat<br>  <br>  for you to see it you gotta drop your body fat to 6-8%<br>  <br>  until then you won't see your abs even if you do 100000000000000000 crunches/twist/side bends/ weighted decline situps/ weighted captains chair<br>  <br>  just drop your body fat to 6-8%<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: NY: what kind of bs is that? you cannot "target problem areas" where did u get that information from? rofl|`|feO6SIfTaa	in a way he is right and wrong .. what he says is true for men but NOT  true for women the average body fat comp for a women should be around the low 20's then really it is excersise and your diet ..try lots of long distance running that helped me but. also dont over do it if you can't get abs having a flat toned belly looks good too dont worry.
qI5W6eyjaa	Crying causes your sinuses to fill up, which leads to the pressure causing the headache. To get ride of your<br>  headache  try  a cold compress? Lie down and just relax and concentrate on taking deep breaths to get oxygen back in your head.|`|msRiT5ngaa	When we cry, water issues from out tear ducts.  There are passageways between the sinuses (the part of your head that fills up when you've got a cold and boogers everywhere), and one of these passageways is connected to your tear glands.  When we cry, depending on the gravity of the crying, the sinuses tend to fill up.  This causes a build-up of pressure on your skull, which includes your brain, much like when you've got a cold.  The lack of relief causes the brain to react with pain, thus the headache.  Also, the loss of water from the manufacture of tears contributes to your brain's aggravated state.

I feel my body completely relax as a result of my first drag from the cigarette.  I get more and more relaxed from each puff and by the time I am 1/2 way through, not much can upset me.  As I near the end, I try to savour each drag knowing that it will be awhile before I smoke again.  Once I stub out the cigarette and exhaly the last stream of smoke, I feel content and ready for the next task at hand.|`|H6psabQoaa	Your gay.
AekVyLneaa	The previous answerer is halfway correct.  Advair contains a long-acting bronchodilator and a steroid.  The long acting steroid is called fluticasone propionate  and the bronchodilator is called salmeterol.  So yes it can give you the jitters or make you nervous.  They do have 3 different Advairs  100/50, 250/50 and 500/50.  The 100, 250 and 500 refer to the strength of the steroid in it.  See if maybe your Dr. can give you one with a lower strength of it.|`|87756LlTaa	No, not generally.  It is a respiratory steroid, so it doesn't get into your blood stream in amounts necessary to cause jitters.  However, most people who use Advair for asthma or COPD also use a form of albuterol.  Albuterol can cause you to feel really nervous, anxious, and jittery, as well as increasing heart rate for a short time after use.   You should ask your doc if you have more questions about your meds.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

You have to get a card from the state and go through it the legal way. Federal laws still say that it is illegal so you could still get busted by the DEA and other fed. organizations but Obama just said that he wouldn't interfere in certain state's rights.

It's called "The Compassionate Use Act" or proposition 215.  As far as state laws go, you are only allowed to possess or use marijuana with a doctor's prescription or if you are a "qualified caregiver". The state also allows some people to grow it to supply the dispensaries with marijuana. However, the feds still raid  dispensaries here and a few people who supplied medical marijuana have been arrested and taken to trial or are awaiting trial. Which is why I do my little derisive *snort!* whenever someone says anything about "state's rights". The states have no rights as far as the Feds are concerned, apparently.<br>  <br>  The Emerald Triangle is in Northern California and encompasses Mendocino, Trinity and Humboldt counties. They have major problems with people planting marijuana there - like plantation sized plots, not just a little bit - and then using strong pesticides. These pesticides run off into nearby streams or get into the water table, poisoning both. There has also been more than one occasion where  someone got too close to a plantation in one of these areas only to hear a bullet zip past their head. If it's a very large plantation, it is well guarded and they will shoot at you. Kinda scary, if you ask me. I don't hike off trail anymore because of that.<br>  <br>  There is a bill on the table in the CA state legislature that would legalize marijuana use and possession for those 21 or over, using pretty much the same standards that we use for alcohol. Not sure if it will pass or not, but  even if it does, it doesn't change federal law. The Feds WILL put up a fight in the federal courts if it passes here, so I expect it to be a long time before you can buy your pack of joints at the corner market or your buds next to the basil at the grocery store.

It doesn't wash out.  Had you asked beforehand, I would have suggested you use a separate, extra pillow case or a towel or a sock or handkerchief or something that you keep handy for that purpose.  Even so, you need to wash out whatever you use regularly so that it doesn't get smelly and germy.<br>  <br>  Moms (or at least dads) understand.  Don't worry about it.

The problem in doing it on to a pillow is what you have found out !!!  the pillow gets stained and is more difficult to wash than your boxers . Is there a pillow case on the pillow ?? If so just remove that and put on a clean one . You could wash that in warm water and try and dry it without your parents seeing I suppose . But you parents will know you are masturbating because all young guys do <br>  When I was a teen I used to do it whilst in bed and ended up with quite messy PJ's !!!   A friend then told me of a better way which is lying on your back and let the ejaculation land on your stomach . You can then use a tissue to wipe clean and no stains anywhere <br>  Don't get too worried about this it happens at some stage to all young guys who leave semen satins in odd areas .

Y0DugutZaa	in order for it to waork u need to keep at it, also change negatives to positives. if you do this repeatedly ot catch yourself when u think a negative thought and change it to something positive u eventually get rid of most negatives and start to think positively. once you are thinking positively you feel better about yourself and more confident and in control of your emotions and thoughts, this will help u to believe that u can do what u put your mind to, ie u begin to believe in yourself and thus you eventually are able to remain motivated and be motivated more easily because being positive all things are possible, also you will be more likely to act on ideas as you will be confident in what u do therefore removing fear. positivity is a chain reaction the thoughts are made evident in emotions and acts, if u think positive then u are more capable of succeeding in what u set out to do, and of obtaining goals.<br>  <br>  physically if you believ that you are worth it then u are more likely to stick to an exercise plan and the more u stick to it the better u will feel not just because of endorphin production but also just having the evidence of increased fitness or weightloss, the success stimulates u to carry on. spiritually, in general faith helps it is at the core of positivity even if u dont believe in god, but just have faith in self which requires positivity.spirituality can be about a relationship with god or with one's place in the world positivity reflects  and can be helped by our beliefs, faith in god can be a source of spiritual strength to feeling more positive about life, etc. one's attitude to the part one plays and place one is in life can also affect and be affected by the type of thought patterns and belief systems we have, if we are positive we are more likely to see the positive and think more highly of what and where we are than if we allow negative thoughts and flawed  (ie negative) beliefs to exist|`|7Rd2SYdtaa	confidence helps you get over that wall<br>  <br>  just believe in yourself even if you failed a couple times,<br>  <br>  we all have the ability to succeed

SkDomhoXaa	i swear by -: eye q mind<br>  <br>  The focus of eye q mind<br>  <br>  Every stage in life requires fatty acids for essential brain function, and adults are no exception. Optimal mental function is important for any task, and a growing body of research indicates that certain nutritional supplements can enhance performance. eye q mind is a formulation specifically developed for adults that includes a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, B vitamins, zinc and magnesium.<br>  <br>  Fatty acids: matter for the mind<br>  The billions of nerve cells and connections that form the central nervous system depend on the presence of omega-3 and omega-6 long chain fatty acids for the brain to function. In fact up to 30% of the dry weight of the brain consists of these fatty acids. <br>  <br>  In order of importance, the fatty acids included in the formulation, are: <br>  <br>  - Omega-3 Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) plays an important role in maintaining and developing certain aspects of brain and eye function, such as moment to moment brain cell signalling.<br>  <br>  - Omega-6 Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) contains anti-inflammatory properties and can be converted by the body into Arachidonic Acid, a fatty acid that forms an integral part of nerve endings. <br>  <br>  - Omega-3 Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) is a structural fatty acid found in the brain and eyes, thus is important for providing ongoing repair.<br>  <br>  The following nutrients work to ensure the optimum functioning of the nervous system: <br>  <br>  B Vitamins for a better brain<br>  Vitamin B12 and folic acid play a role in the formation of healthy blood, which transports oxygen and facilitates its utilisation through the hemispheres in the brain. Vitamin B6, along with zinc and magnesium, are essential elements for the functioning of the nervous system and are also required for the synthesis of neuro-transmitters, which allow for communication between neurons and cells.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Zinc and Vitamin E<br>  Zinc and Vitamin E are antioxidants that help protect cells and tissues from free radical damage. Antioxidants are of particular importance in helping to protect nerve cells. Zinc may also help maintain healthy nerve cells because of its role in cell replication.<br>  <br>  <br>  Magnesium for muscles and nerves <br>  Magnesium assists muscle and nerve function, and also helps regulate blood glucose levels, important in fuelling the brain throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Our bodies cannot make these nutrients, and it is therefore important that an adequate intake is maintained in our diets. eye q mind can help ensure dietary intake of these vital nutrients.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Long term or short term?

It's highly unlikely, but nevertheless possible.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Does your everyday diet include a lot of greens?  The family of B vitamins is essential for keeping memory and some other mental abilities strong.  Lack of B vitamins has been implicated not only in ordinary folk who have lesser memory ability, but also in memory-destroying illnesses such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.<br>  <br>  Even if you tank up on greens all the time, your body may not properly absorb all the B vitamins you need, or it may not absorb the trace minerals that allow the B vitamins to be processed the right way(s).  This is a medical field that still has a lot of PhD theses in it still (among other research incentives).<br>  <br>  And yes, there are probably lots of other reasons why you have a poor memory.

i2GRGLIpaa	"Eating healthy" means eating the correct amounts from each food group. To develop healthy eating habits you should practice cutting the amount of fats, oils, and sugars you eat. Eat square meals that consist of a grain or carbohydrate, protein, and a fruit or vegetable. Another trick for healthy eating is eat little and often. Eating smaller portions allows your body to break down your food more easily and will keep you from eating too much. Healthy eating starts with self-control. When you feel hungry, go for a nutritional snack, like an apple with a handful of almonds instead of a bag of chips.|`|2PZwRa3faa	having a balanced diet|`|HJdsty5uaa	You need:<br>  <br>  Whole grains<br>  Fresh Vegetables<br>  Fresh Fruits<br>  Lean Proteins<br>  Lots of Water|`|iJbslaQNaa	a proper diet|`|fTztIC22aa	It completely depends on one's goals and eating healthy is pretty much whatever eating habits helps them achieve them.

EeTs9DqUaa	There is NO way a non diabetic would ever go over 200!  It sounds like the medications were working but one of the issues with Glipizide is it can cause lows, the metformin can't.  When you have felt shaky etc what was your blood glucose level?  <br>  <br>  You should ask your doctor to do another test called Oral Glucose Tolerance Test OGTT.  They test your blood fasting, have you drink a special liquid and then test again several times over the next 2-3 hours.  If you go over 140 you have pre-diabetes and over 200 is diabetes.|`|AA10723498	Oh yes, get another opinion for sure.  First of all, to test for diabetes you have to fast from midnight until the test.  If you're doing great without the medications, perhaps it was a false reading.  My husband is diabetic and his Dr. always has him fast before testing.  It could be you still have diabetes, but get a second opinion is always wise if you have doubts.  I wish you the best.|`|k1zMsWxOaa	No, you are diabetic, the urination, thirst etc is high blood glucose and the shaky feeling is a low blood glucose level<br>  you wouldn't be that high without diabetes<br>  <br>  what probably happened is you took too much insulin, the reason for this error is most likely your pancreas kicked back in and produced insulin due to the break in its over load, this is called the honeymoon period in diabetics and most go through it.<br>  I would never let a regular doctor adjust my dosage, see a diabetic specialist.<br>  Actually I would say you are a type 1 diabetic, not type 2, which means needles and even closer management of your glucose levels<br>  <br>  you definitely have diabetes, 100%, ok?|`|AA12109796	non diabetic people rarelty go over 130 at all - even when theyve ate something massive. a non diabetic person would never reach 487. ever. i think you are in denial. the medication is working, lowering your blood sugar. you must continue taking your medication or your blood sugar will go high. <br>  <br>  the reason you feel like you have low sugars if you havent eaten for 6-7 hours is that the medication is lowering your blood sugars, assuming you are eating at least 3 times a day. if you do not eat for 7 hours the medication is lowering your blood sugar anyway. yoiu need to ensure you eat regularly! eat breakfast lunch and dinner. plus healthy snacks if you feel huingry. if you feel low have 10g fast acting carb, followed by a slow release carb|`|aW59AbDaaa	If your diagnosis had been based on a blood glucose reading that wasn't so astronomically high, I would be more inclined to believe that it was a laboratory error.  As it is, a 487 number is extremely hard to explain as anything other than coming from a diabetic.  Your doctor really should have taken a second reading to confirm the diagnosis before starting you on medication, but probably thought that there was no real doubt about it (and that your extremely high blood glucose needed immediate attention).<br>  <br>  I find it very strange that you weren't given a meter to monitor your blood glucose numbers.  That's really the way to tell the effect of not taking your medications.  If you don't have a meter, please call your doctor and ask for one.  I think it's extremely inadvisable to discontinue medication without your doctor's consent, but I suppose it may be ok to do so briefly if it will help you confirm your diagnosis.  But don't stop medication until you have a blood glucose meter and can monitor your numbers.  Otherwise you are just defying doctor's orders without any way of telling whether it is harming your health.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  In spite of my skepticism I really do hope that your diagnosis was mistaken.|`|rVvtoljyaa	The American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists both require two separate fasting blood tests on two different days to diagnose Diabetes. There can be false readings and this will eliminate those. Now, a reading of 487 random test would be highly indicative of Diabetes but a second test should have been performed while fasting at least. I was diagnosed with a random test of 299 and while fasting at 289. The Endocrinologist who wrote Diabetes for Dummies talks about the many misdiagnosis he has seen for diabetes and always performs another pair of tests before starting or changing treatment.<br>  <br>  I"m surprised your doctor went straight for a double med solution, metformine is normally started first and then tests are done to see how that is working. Did your doctor not prescribe a home glucose meter for you to test yourself regularly? That would be extremely unusual in this day and age. The meter manufacturers will give you the meter, your insurance will normally cover up to 3-4 times testing per day for test strips (not all do). <br>  <br>  I would definitely seek another opinion from another doctor and if you are then diagnosed with Diabetes, ask for a referral to an Endocrinologist, they specialize in Diabetes.

FicyC2TXaa	Most breast lumps in men are actually a condition called gynaecomastia, a button-like growth under the nipple and areola area that can be felt and is sometimes visible to the naked eye and occasionally it can be quite tender.<br>  <br>  This increase in the amount of breast tissue is not a tumour and occurs due to changes in hormone balances at times like adolescence.<br>  <br>  It's not unusual and it's temporary. <br>  <br>  You don't say how old you are; I'm assuming your quite young, forgive me if I'm wrong.<br>  <br>  The chances of a young male getting breast cancer are as close to zero as makes no difference.<br>  <br>  Men do get breast cancer, but fewer than 1% of those diagnosed with breast cancer are male.<br>  <br>  And 80% of all people diagnosed with breast cancer are over 50; most men diagnosed with it are over 60.<br>  <br>  It's rare in women under 40, less than 0.1% of those diagnosed are under 30, and breast cancer is almost unheard of in under 25s.<br>  <br>  So you can see how huge the odds against a young man getting breast cancer are. <br>  <br>  What you describe is very likely gynaecomastia.

rVvtoljyaa	Diabetes is the same in Native Americans and other groups. It was found more common in certain tribes and that lead to some of the research showing the genetic component of Diabetes even in type 2 diabetics. There is a gene that if you don't have it, you won't contract Diabetes. However, if you have that gene, you can contract it and is more likely if you are heavier. They also noticed it was more common once the Native Americans became less active due to modernization.
IKakoOfyaa	I feel so badly for you.  Been there and done that.  My husband and I managed to work through our problems, but he didn't seem interested in doing that until I had moved on with my life.

That, in and of itself, is an ongoing process and I often find myself wondering if I would be better off without him.<br>  <br>  The pain does lessen after time.  In fact, the sooner you can pick yourself up and get on with your life, the better off you're going to be.  I'm not saying this will be easy...it isn't, but the best revenge is a life well lived.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|tGcNmDUZaa	I lost 18lbs in 3 months following the below plan I made up myself:<br>  <br>  Diet:<br>  1200-1500 calories a day (depending on how tall you are - I had just over 1000, but that's because I'm 5'1)<br>  Try to eat 3 healthy meals without snacking, this will help you lose weight because often you have too big snacks without realising. <br>  Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, most important is the one immediately after waking up, this will kick-start your weight loss.<br>  <br>  Exercise:<br>  Walk briskly for 30 minutes, 3 or 4 times a week, and do 50 sit ups a day. Try to incorporate exercise into your daily life - some stretches when you have a spare 5 minutes will really help you feel more energised.<br>  <br>  Weigh yourself weekly. You will lose at least 5kg on this diet in 3 months - I promise! Good luck and happy birthday for May :)|`|dmvr05QUaa	a huge thing is to do aerobic exercising (running, walking) and to add weight training...building muscle will help your body lose fat while it is not exercising....giving you better results....and you should easily be able to lose 5kg by the end of may if not more!.... just tell yourself to stay away from fried foods, soda, and butter laiden things.....just make a conscious effort to eat healthier too!!!
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|jQCy5x9Iaa	Hey dear,<br>  there's an article i read and it helped me very much, it was talking about meal plans and how to use the calorie shifting technique to achieve your ideal weight, this web based program it's all about how to get you to lose 9 lbs. every 11 days in a healthy manner, So you will lose this extra weight in no time.<br>  anyway you can see for yourself here is the link to this article <br>  <a href="http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/fat-loss-for-idiots-online-diet-system-secret-tips/" rel="nofollow">http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/...</a> hope it helps|`|JxmJg37Iaa	You should eat more than an apple for breakfast. eat every tw- 3 hours this will improve your metabolism which in turn would help you lose weight.

When you decide to lose weight, <br>  <br>  you should lose the extra pounds safely and in a healthy way.

It is also an easy way to give your children the daily nutrients they need.<br>  Now I'm not just saying this.<br>  The Acai berry is bursting with vital nutrients. It's consisted of 52.2 grams of carbohydrates, 8.1 grams of protein, <br>  <br>  and 44.2 grams of fiber forms for every 100 grams of the fruit's extract. It also has the highest antioxidant matter <br>  <br>  among organic and inorganic fruits alike.<br>  <br>  Best of all, it helps your body burn fat properly by speeding up your metabolism and improving your digestion and not <br>  <br>  by forcing your body to flush out whatever food you eat.<br>  <br>  So stop just thinking about it and take some massive action by ordering a free trial here: <a href="http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/</a>|`|c4cb310732bdbbcd88cc2b8cf1011b2caa	the cabbage soup diet can help you lose up to 10 lbs in 7 days alone.

The second thing you need to address is the fact that you are not eating enough.  Food is fuel.  Just like a car needs gas, your body needs nutritiants. Portion size & a balanced meal plan are key.  Drinking plenty of water is also good for you.  I personally HATE plain water, so I use splenda & alternate between limon & lime juice to give it a different taste.  Remember 1-2 pounds of weightloss each week is considered a realistic goal.

I think it can alter the results somehow. I am not exactly sure, but I know that I have read in a few magazines not, and my friend who works for a gyno told me not to have sex 24 hours before. Oh, and don't think you are going to fool them. They can tell. My friend told me that the doctor she works for has made clients reschedule their paps due to the fact that they had just had sex before their appointment.|`|a89877a964545eacedb3103757dcc30eaa	I have heard it can because sometimes there may be semen left inside.

There is such a thing as too much protein, Bubba & it will do more damage than not enough.  You're better off preparing a milkshake at home & adding (1) raw egg to the blender.

YoITtCbfaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Yes, it could be an allergic reaction, or it could be a less severe reaction referred to as "oral allergy syndrome".<br>  <br>  Oral allergy syndrome can START off mild and then get FAR WORSE.<br>  <br>  This will sometimes begin as a mild "funny feeling" in the mouth/throat/lips and it can progress to a full allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  Usually, this will happen in people that are allergic to something in the family of that allergen--ie--the BIRCH tree allergy, and then eating something related to BIRCH--such as APPLES, PEARS, PEACHES, ect....<br>  <br>  Strawberries and Bananas are a very common food allergy--both as themselves, or as a related allergy.<br>  <br>  Also, you can be allergic to a food MORE when it is in a RAW state then when it is COOKED--such as with the banana bread vs the banana in the smoothie....<br>  <br>  The funny thing with food allergies, is you never really know sometimes that you HAVE them until you get tested, and even then, you can have a mild enough allergy, or have taken some medication prior to the testing--whether it be an antacid (certain antacids are actually antihistamines....) or some eye drops, or even some asthma medication that caused the test to not read as strongly, so the allergen was missed.  <br>  <br>  IF you find yourself feeling weird after eating something, avoid it afterwords....<br>  <br>  Get allergy tested.....<br>  <br>  Get an epi pen.....<br>  <br>  How do I know?  I have had food allergies for years, did not WANT to get and epi pen (I was a paramedic, so I always had access to epi and a syringe anyhow--just not spring loaded), and I had a few docs in the past that tried some wacky things...."food allergies are caused by being in the sun...." (did I mention the docs were wacky??--and also I did not listen to those wacks....)<br>  <br>  I now know what I am allergic to, as well as finding out how different things are each year---ie---NOT from CONCENTRATE orange juice is fine right now....yet, CONCENTRATED ORANGE JUICE IS becoming a HUGE problem for many of us, yet, no other items are listed on the ingredients besides WATER ....how ODD?....or is it?  (I think we need to really find out what is going in our food products..).....<br>  <br>  I also carry an epi pen, and when I had a doc tell me to cut out everything EXCEPT eggs and nuts for protein while waiting for my test results to come back, it almost killed me---literally.  Those were to the 2 items I did not know I was allergic to, which I was eating weekly, but in small amounts....<br>  <br>  So, get tested, and carry an epi pen, and believe no one.|`|AA11538461	So, do you have this problem only with raw fruits?

I would know, haha, i've got a bunch. D:<br>  <br>  Go to an allergist they can test you for things, and fruits in particular. You might be allergic to berries or bananas and maybe not to ALL fruits. All fruits are different in most allergy cases.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|vA07XhcKaa	I have had similar problems for years and one day, my Ear, Nose and throat doctor had blood drawn and sent it to get checked for allergy response. I was shocked by how many food items I react too.<br>  <br>  If you ever go get a cat scan where you have to drink the dye or get a dye injection, one of the things they ask you is if you are allergic to strawberries. There are many who are allergic to these.<br>  <br>  I am allergic to wheat and peanuts and I was sick a lot when I was a child and the doctor said sometimes if we are sick, For example with strep throat, and that day that your body is fighting off the reaction, you say, ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, your immune system may in the future associate those items with infection and a foreign body and try and fight it every time you eat it, thus, an allergy is born. Sometimes too, you are just born with them as these can be passed on from mother to son etc.<br>  <br>  My advice is to get these blood test performed and in the meantime avoid these foods. One day it may just be throat swelling, the next time you could die.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	if you're allergic to fruit, you're allergic to fruit. case closed.

DisdrG4Taa	Hydrocodone preparations like the one in the medication Vicodin, not only should rarely if ever be prescribed to migraine patients, they are in most cases contra-indicated.  People who take analgesics for headaches including Tylenol and hydrocodone, frequently develop a condition known as analgesic rebound headache.  In this condition, the patient gets a headache, so they take the medication, the pain calms down but returns after a few hours so they take the medication again, each time the headache which returns seems worse. They may decrease the intensity of the pain for a few hours; however, they appear to feed into the pain system in such a way that chronic headaches may result. The medication overuse headache (MOH) may feel like a dull, tension-type headache or may be a more severe migraine-like headache. Other medication taken to prevent or treat the headaches may not be effective while analgesics are being overused. <br>  There are some migraine specific abortive medications, but for most patients, prevention is the key.  Your provider should take a careful history, and do a good examination, they should ask about things which you are exposed to that may trigger your headache.  Ideally, they will give you a headache diary to track the triggers and symptoms.  If you are having more than 2 migraines a month you may need a preventive medication, which has no pain medication in it at all.  You should also have available a medication which stops the headaches called an abortive or rescue medication.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your condition.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  As a note Ultram is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic medication and meets the medical definition of a narcotic.  It is not a controlled medication under US law, which makes some people state that it is non-narcotic.  It is addictive, and some people can have withdrawals if they take high doses for extended periods. Since it is an analgesic medication, it is not considered to be a good choice for migraine management, especially if a person has more than 1 migraine a month.<br>  <br>  <br>  While the lay literature that you will find in online sources will use the euphemistic term narcotic-like, the medical definition of a narcotizing substance is one that causes drowsiness, sleepiness or dulls the thinking.  If you look at the side effect profile on any of your sources they will list these as the side effects of tramadol.
YoITtCbfaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Rice cakes...oh joy!  (said very sarcastically).<br>  <br>  They do not taste the greatest, but, when you are starting off on this road, it helps to be able to put the food on SOMETHING when you want peanut butter or something like that of which you usually spread on bread.<br>  <br>  I use the "lightly salted"...but read the ingredients.<br>  <br>  Also, CORN tortilla chips--the crispy crunchy kind--to make like some nachos with--again, read the ingredients. --my local large food store has a decent store brand of these.--also not bad for when you need to add something to a meal for a carb/starch or just need a snack. (make sure it is NOT FLOUR tortilla's)<br>  <br>  (gluten free food is EXPENSIVE)<br>  <br>  While you really probably do not need to go totally gluten free, you will be quite near there with the dilema you are in.<br>  <br>  RICE PASTA....if you can not do regular pasta---the one I would recommend is tikyada brand--spelling may be slightly off....but it is close.<br>  <br>  It is brown rice pasta, and very good.  (again, double check the ingredients, but should be ok for what you listed to avoid.)<br>  <br>  This has just a slightly different texture than normal pasta, but it cooks well....a bit pricy, but tastes the best.  my favorite is the longish noodles--they cook the best of all of them--like the linguini<br>  <br>  Mashed potatoes--again, read read read to find a brand for yourself...get non-flavored, and then kick them up with some shredded cheese or something.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.....<br>  <br>  ps--I cut out gluten for 2 years, felt GREAT!!  Did well....only ran into a problem last year when they gave me a few food allergies to contend with too.....<br>  <br>  That made trying to juggle gluten free as well as more food allergies WAY limiting....it is very difficult now....and since my gluten is a milder problem....well.....I do try to limit the gluten though.|`|sm4wXNOqaa	how about cheese and dairy products.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|HRZnFFzSaa	This site might help you...it reviews some diet plans. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lose-the-fat-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lose-the-fat-now.com</a><br>  <br>  The acia berry is amazing...hoodia is another one you could try.

I hate to say it but diet and exercise is the best answer to give you.  Im 17 and i was 185 when i was fifteen.  I am about 5'7 and i weigh about 135 right now and i am very happy with the way i look.  It took me about a year to loose the first fifty pounds but this is what i did. <br>  <br>  Run for as long as you possibly can, whether it be on a treadmill or outside.  Aim for 30 minutes and if you feel like you can do more go for it!!<br>  Eat about 1400 calories a day, i hate to pick a number for you because i dont know the specifics of your body type but that is healthy for a growing fifteen year old who needs to loose weight.  <br>  <br>  Its going to take about a week for you to see results but you don't stop! The weight will come off in time :)<br>  <br>  But give yourself a little bit of time each day.  An hour of "you" time to take care of yourself will benefit you tremendously in the long run.  And if you hate running like i did, just push yourself for a little while and if youre lucky you will become addicted to it like i did too! Just think "work now, rest later."<br>  <br>  whatever you do, dont fast, it doesnt work i promise youll gain it right back.   <br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you, i know what it feels like!

It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|uiGx0rPVaa	okay just drink 40-50 oz of water a day, cardio 5x a week or 1 hr, limit sugars, eat organic. email if u have questions k? :)<br>  <br>  And I recommend the Taibo workout by Billy Blanks! :)|`|F7EhEYSYaa	I'm 12 too, trying to lose wight for the summer. <br>  I've run on the treadmill every night without cutting carbs, i burn about 400 calories, and I eat what I want ( without overeating)<br>  I dance, and I do crunchs
biCk7SKmaa	Well, it doesn't hurt while they're being put on (but bring chapstick 'cause if your orthodontist is like mine he'll have to stretch your mouth with this plastic thing), but for the next five days or so your mouth will be really sore. So eat lots of soup and pudding in the meantime! Don't worry though, the pain goes away soon enough, trust me, I had braces for two and a half years.<br>  Good Luck!!<br>  (P.S. If your braces can have colors, get navy or black, (or any dark color)  it makes your teeth look really white! Stay away from yellows though, because they turn brown after a while.)<br>  :]]|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	Getting them on doesnt hurt at all, just takes time, so be patient. Put some chap stick on your lips right beofre going in there, your mouth will be held open with an appliance and this tends to dry your lips out. Also, its a good idea to take some Tylenol before going in to help with the soreness later in the day. Continue taking the Tylenol, of course follow the directions as far as dosing instructions on the bottle, for soreness. The pain/soreness should subside in about a week.|`|JI6IYe9Aaa	when they are putting them on, no not reallly but it just feeels weird they just put a little pressure on your teeth, nothing to bad though.<br>  buttt,  <br>  they hurt alot for the first week,<br>  i have mine on right noww.<br>  i have had them on for about 9 months,<br>  and getting them on was the worst pain experience through out the whole process.<br>  at first(like right when you get out of the dentist office) you think there not gonna hurt a bit cuz they dont hurt at all right after you get them..<br>  but they gradually get more tender then it gets to excrusiating pain.<br>  it feels like your teeth are so frail and thin and the braces are just over powering your teeth, it hurtts, im not gonna liee!<br>  so ALL you can eat is stuff like mashed potatoes and apple sauce for like six days!<br>  butt there is an upside.. they straighten REALLY fast the first week.<br>  i had a huge gap in the front of my teeth, and it went away in like i think two days,<br>  so the pain is well worth it after because they get straight super fastt! :P<br>  i hope i helped you outtt! :)|`|z3QsWmzpaa	when i had mine first put on i couldnt eat probably for the first few days i mean like i couldnt bite it something that wasnt soft and also it gave me little uslers but the densit gives you wax to put on your braces to put on where it is irrating you but just think of the end result where your gonna have nice perfectly straight teeth<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|mqxEw2daaa	it doesn't hurt, just small amounts of pressure. then afterwards the sores are really annoying. you'll be fine, just take care of them!|`|cz4lmVBNaa	They don't hurt while they're putting them on, but they will hurt like mad after as they begin to move your teeth.|`|adwkFYYraa	Don't worry. It doesn't hurt to get them put on. Not at all! It's actually a pretty cool process and it's really fun!!! It will start to get sore a couple hours after you leave the orthodontist, so just take an advil or something after you finish getting them on and you'll be fine. I was scared about it too before I got mine, but it's no big deal. Then the fun part is choosing your colors!!! <br>  Good Luck!|`|gz33smIGaa	no dont be scared. it doesnt hurt when it gets put on so dont fret about it. you might just get a couple kanker sores so i would wear the wax if i were you. but its all good so good luck with braces!|`|qQV2AKHSaa	Take some Tylenol or Advil before you get them on that way, in case they do hurt, you'll be ok. Its ok after the 2nd or 3rd day (depending on braces) so you won't hurt bad.|`|3DxWzPUYaa	dont worry everything will be great..at first u might feel weird..n it mught hurt a little.... but the next few days you will feel GREAT!!! ?|`|hAzbW082aa	Depends on if your scared when you get there my friends have braces they said it didn't hurt until they got scared. hope it gose well|`|ttuZbRjbaa	mine hurt when i got them put on... and i couldn't eat anything for a while... but after a week or so it wasn't so bad... good luck! :)|`|AA11293619	I heard it may be irritating but I dont think it hurts.

And if they are bottoms then your gums will get chewed up and hurt for a long time but after like a month or so it usually goes away.|`|gMBoYh5kaa	It doesn't hurt at all nvr it feels cool to me wen I got them on & tightened but if u do feel pain take advil because advil is for inflamation (wat you will be experiencing) Ive had mine for 9 months <br>  <br>  <br>  (future orthodontist)|`|dUbRn8hHaa	their going to numb your mouth down so you'll probably not feel anything but if it hurts later there is this gel you can get at CVS..i think oregel or something like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ke3h5Nttaa	No it doesn't hurt at all! At first it is fun becasue you are the center of ttention for a while because everyone wants to seee you smile! :) It will be fine though!
9NpXU7D2aa	well you need to get her to a doctor some how. <br>  sounds like she has a detached retina and if it is not treated ASAP with surgery then she will go totally blind in the eye she is seeing the spider webs in. <br>  she's not crazy or anything so don't worry about that. <br>  <br>  here read about it:<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/tc/retinal-detachment-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/tc/retin...</a><br>  <br>  and GET HER TO AN EYE DOCTOR OR IF YOU CAN'T GET HER INTO AN EYE DOCTOR THEN GET HER TO THE ER ASAP AND ASK THEM TO CHECK HER RETINA.|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	She needs to see an opthamologist immediately to rule out possible retinal detachment.  Flashing lights, especially with blurred vision,  can be a sign of a detached or detching retina.  Flashing lights can also could be an aura of migrane.  <br>  <br>  I have had this happen to me.  My sister has as well.  Mine turned out to be migranes, hers were detaching retinas.  If caught in time, retinas can be reattached by a doctor.<br>  <br>  Only a doctor can determine this by examining the eye.  Take her to the emergency room if an opthamologist is not available.|`|AA11530246	Not being a Dr. I would only guess Macular Degeneration. The symptoms are exactly the same as my Mom who is 92 yrs. young. There are two types of Macular Degeneration Wet and Dry.

qYKjqZxOaa	Vaseline  :)|`|g2HrIjJOaa	Sometimes it's the cream that is irritating to your skin. Try soaking your skin in warm water first to help loosen the hair follicle. Then tweeze, wax, pluck. If you still get irritation, see your doctor or a dermatologist who may be able to help you out.<br>  I get swollen when I get my eyebrows waxed and I've also found that taking 2 ibuprofen prior to getting the waxing done, helps with the swelling. Perhaps try that too!|`|yAziXQi7aa	This sued to happen to me, too.  It is mainly because I miss the hair I am tweezing and grab the skin.  I usually use Vaseline if my skin is particularly dry and sensitive.  If it seems like it is OK, I skip the Vaseline and use regular powder: I put on the area I am tweezing and it helps me grab the hair rather than the skin...hope this helps!|`|xsq9vT7Eaa	Vaseline works wonders :)|`|wFSAv4lYaa	probably vaseline. It's the best|`|ORUAtr0kaa	Threading is apparently a lot less irritating and good for sensitive skin, i personally don't really have sensitive, (well slightly..but not too bad)so I don't know about the creams.|`|ATYp6h7Oaa	im not sure about cream but i get my brows waxed.<br>  Before you tweeze have a very warm towel and put in on ur brows for a minute then make sure there dry and put a little ice on them (the warmness will open ur pores and the ice will numb them)|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Aveeno is very soothing for irritated skin.|`|oTFw9dkJaa	baby lotion or baby oil!<br>  thats what they use at the salon, thats what i use at home.|`|XGlyB56Faa	hey i pluck and well idk i dont know. sorry

H8gsDRWeaa	An out-of-kilter musce in your eye usually corresponds to an out-of-kilter condition elsewhere in your life.  Fatigue, stress, too much coffee or a drug you are taking can all cause muscular twitching, especially in the muscles of the eyelild.  <br>  DO THIS;<br>  Close your eyes and apply hot compresses (not too hot. 15 minutes at a time). GET MORE REST. A shut eye usually cures a twitching one. Apply the "DIF Test" to the problem<br>  D = Duration<br>  I = Intenstity<br>  F = Frequency.<br>  If any of these factors goes into the red zone -- that is, if the twitching is persistent or bothersome -- see your eye doctor|`|KFXjRpnFaa	there's nothing to help it really but I can give you some info.

adV7C8raaa	My dermatologist recommended the Antibacterial cetaphil bar to me, it is supposed to help manage the bacteria that causes acne. Using something antibacterial will help your acne, cetaphil in general is very good with dry sensitive skin. I don't have a problem with oily skin myself, but using the cetaphil antibacterial bar has not burdened me with oilier skin as some gentle cleasers do, since many don't contain the harsh chemicals that dry out your skin. For your black heads you need a scrub that will exfoliate your skin to bring those to the surface, so i would add that to your daily routine. I have always liked St. Ives Apricot scrub, because it is a simple scub you can purchase anywhere, plus you can get it in sensitive, normal and oily/acne formulas. I don't know what to tell you about the discoloration on your skin, that is going to require more than a cleanser to clear up.<br>  <br>  Honestly, visit your dermatologist. If your acne is truly "terrible", or even mediocre it is well worth the investment. Plus they can help you with the discoloration.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
207dFmdHaa	Oh FONZ, are you trying to quit? Im sorry I am not any help on this...many of my friends have tried to quit, quit for awhile, then started back again. My best friend only quit, cold turkey when they told her she had breast cancer. I have had friends quit while they are pregnant, and then started back the day the baby was born. I understand it is the hardest thing in the world to do....one of my husbands employees used the patch, and the gum......and therapy, he always had times when he smoked, when he got up in the morning, on the way to work, after coffee, at break, on the phone, etc, so when he was doing those things he chewed the gum and started walking.....I have no answers, each person I hear has to do what they have to do....I know I am typing alot and not saying much, all I can say is that me and Belle will pray for you....anything we can do to help....are you ok?|`|EdhW394qaa	Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, the length of time hooked, does not matter. An addict (and that is what we are) is an addict no matter what.  I am trying to quit, and I have smoked for 26 years. I am only 40 years old, so over half my life I have been addicted!  I have researched and researched. I am currently using Final Smoke...its a help, but there is no miracle out there that I have found. I have friends who have done hypnosis, and it worked great...I have also been reading Allen Carr's The Easy Way To Stop Smoking...its pretty good too. I have not finished it yet, but everything in there makes sense so far! He was a 5 pack a day smoker! So he speaks from experience!  You can look part of it up online, maybe even the whole book...  If you really want to quit, throw them all away, and get started!  But make sure you really want to. Because if you don't have your mind there, your body will not accept it either. Good luck!!!  You CAN do it!!|`|O1ub7pAvaa	actually i smoked for almost 40 years... quit through a nicotine anonymous group on the net.. <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/voicesofnicotinerecovery/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/voi...</a><br>  <br>   i have been smoke free for over 5 years now!!!|`|A0825FVZaa	My brother got cancer of the tongue.He was operated on at Loyola University in Chicago.The whole 7 th floor was head and neck cancers only.He was told 99 1/2 % of his cancer was caused by smoking. His main wish was to be able to sleep. Because of smoking , his lungs were filled with fluid, the fluid had to be kept clear with a suction hose through a whole in his esophagus. He had 6 drainage holes in his neck.He looked like frankenstein.He had to go through massive radiation treatments.It burned his salivary glands. Do you think he quit smoking, finally? YES!!!!

5p7cQAokaa	To break out means to literally, go to bed with decent skin and wake up and have pimples. Three cheers for teenage years!! Lol!  If you just have one or two pimples, I wouldn't call it breaking out.|`|thkNNDHsaa	Usually break out means 2 or more pimples.|`|tSi10jneaa	That's called a breakout.<br>  Switch to good diet|`|wNLmGzSwaa	If it's on your back, I think a break out could mean lots.

WB6G1uJ1aa	You may want to cut down on the junk food. If you have an incredible urge to snack, then just eat fruits or vegetables. Drink water if you're really hungry after you just finished eating. If you can, eat something minty when you're hungry because mint takes away hunger. Gum doesnt help because you're chewing. Try brushing your teeth instead.|`|947a0dc92dd1bc409cf80a04f33e48e0aa	how about eating more protein and some good fats like avocado or olive oil, which will help keep u feeling full. Veggies too are great. Like chicken over salad with cheese, avocado and a little vinaigrette dressing.

She needs to know that if the worst happened you would miss her and be unhappy but that you are strong enough to cope and that she must not worry about you.<br>  <br>  you obviously from what you have said, believe in an afterlife so tell her that you know that she will always be with you guiding and helping you. that you will always talk to her and know she is there beside you and your comfort will be that she is no longer in pain and suffering.<br>  <br>  I know I am leaping around in the dark here but i don't know if she is actually terminal or if it is just that she thinks she might be.<br>  <br>  Basically what she needs is for you to be confident but  supportive. She needs to know that she can lean on you. When on chemo the moods can change frequently. You need to adapt to her frame of mind at the time. Don't block her by telling her she is being silly or she shouldn't be thinking like that because that will make her feel that she is alone with her thoughts and that you can't or won't understand what she is trying to say.<br>  <br>  I know how hard this is for you and my love and prayers are winging their way to you. <br>  <br>  God Bless you both sweetheart.<br>  <br>  Love mel.XXXXX|`|74BoPCASaa	I am a survivor.

We can fight our own pains ourselves because we know our pains better then anyone else. What we need is to get that positive energy boosted in us.<br>  In your case you have to boost that energy in your wife, by always remain positive. Don't join her into her tears.<br>  She will survive or no that's not the question now. The question now is that when she is fine after the treatment...where do you plan to take her to , Is it europe or asia discuss this with her.<br>  <br>  Now the story , my father got mouth cancer, declared between 3rd and 4th stage, he went through a surgery lasting long hours, and then radiation.<br>  By the time his radiation was still going on, my father in law was diagnosed with esophegous cancer approaching towards the stomach also between 3rd-4th stage.<br>  He went through immidiate surgery and 8 chemo sessions, he is fine today and we are hoping that he shall be fine always.<br>  <br>  During the above two cases, I was able to give that smile to them and let them feel that they will be fine, as if they have just got some fever and once the medical course is done they will be back home. <br>  <br>  I also made my family and my father in law's family member, never to cry a single tear. As our tears are going to discourage them. And we something encourging them rather.<br>  <br>  NEVER CRY FOR SOME ONE WHO IS ALIVE, AND NEVER CRY FOR SOME WHO HAS DIED, AS THE DEAD ONES NEVER COME BACK.<br>  <br>  BIRTH AND LIFE IS THE JOB OF GOD AND LEAVE THAT ONTO HIM, WITHOUT INTERFARING.<br>  <br>  IF SOME ONE PASSES AWAY BECAUSE HE HAS TO AS EVERYONE HAS TO. <br>  <br>  So in your case , please agree with me, and never talk about death and alwlays try to remain in high spirit when facing her. I know its difficult, but remember its she who is not well. but you are well so you can do what she can not do. and she will follow you then.<br>  <br>  CHEMO IS ONE OF BEST TREATMENT FOR CANCER, ITS VERY MUCH EFFECTIVE.<br>  BELIEVE IN GOD AND KEEP HIM IN MIND AND THINK OF DOING THINGS, YOU WILL SUCCEED. DONT GIVE UP , JUST KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU ARE TO PERFORM.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK.<br>  <br>  I NEVER INFORMED ANYONE  AND ALSO REFUSED MY FATHER IN LAW'S FAMILY TO GO ON TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT HIS PROBLEM.<br>  AS MORE VISITOR COME TO HOSPITALS AND MORE THEY SHOW THEIR PITY THE MORE PATIENT IS DEPRESSED.|`|CNkGM3ELaa	My boyfriend of 2 years has blood cancer. We had been dating for about 2 months and i was like 14 and he was 15, about 2 weeks after his 16th birthday he was diagnosed. at first it was really hard. He was always int he hospital and about 2 hours away. It was so hard he didnt want to die, and hes so young. Hes now 17 and doing good. Good in the terms that he has cancer and isnt dead. He has so much hope and wants to survive for hsi family and his life. Im so proud of him, and although the cancer isnt gone, i still consider him a survivor, because he has survived through so much more than alot of people think they can handle. I hope this helped maybe a little. Your wife and your family is in my prayers. Good Luck <br>  :)|`|ahBRuGOCaa	I'm really sorry about what both you, and your wife, are going through right now. I am 15 years old, and have been fighting a rare form of leukemia (cml, rare for my age group) since i was 11. After going through many rounds of intense chemo i recieved a bone marrow transplant that failed. This means that i have, probably, 5 years to live. But i never let any of this stuff stop me. I dance, and go to school, and hang out with friends, and do all the normal things anyone my age would do, i get chemo once a week, as like maitence to keep it in remission, and i just deal with the punches as they come. What you really need to do, is never give up, always stay positive and make light of the subject, me and my friends even joke about it. I wish you both the best of luck in your fight, it's really a team effort, she needs your support|`|OGO3sz1Maa	Hi Dave, You and your wonderful wife are in my prayers. I'm just starting my journey, 1 chemo so far. next one in 2 weeks. I m ok right now but I talk to God constantly and thank Him when I have a good feeling and no pain. I thank Him for my life and when I leave this life the best is yet to come and He will be right there with me. I only hope I can be as strong as your wife is. It helps me to think positive thoughts about everything and everyone in my life and think of all the things I need to do or want to do when I am able to do them. It is good to try to keep busy if you have the energy! I keep getting slower and slower but so far I make it and if I don't I just stop for a while and readjust my thoughts. Please keep me posted on how your wife is doing, ok? God bless you both and give you strength.<br>  Bubbles

4ZE8RG7Waa	chlamydia is one of the most common STDs. Because there often aren't any symptoms, though, lots of people can have chlamydia and not know it.<br>  <br>  The bacteria can move from one person to another through sexual intercourse, and possibly through oral-genital contact. If someone touches bodily fluids that contain the bacteria and then touches his or her eye, a chlamydial eye infection is possible. Chlamydia also can be passed from a mother to her baby while the baby is being delivered. This can cause pneumonia and conjuntivitis, which can become very serious for the baby if it's not treated. You can't catch chlamydia from a towel, doorknob, or toilet seat.|`|HHyny0JSaa	No, thats why it is called a sexually transmitted disease.

If you lack carbs, your body will begin slowly, breaking down that fat. Also excersice will do it.|`|dm7xLxVuaa	The more muscle you have, the more calories you body needs to maintain those muscles. If you keep your caloric intake to a minimum, then your body will start to use the fat on your body for energy, thus reducing the amount of fat hanging from your belly. And strengthening your abdominal muscles will have two effects: first, it helps you build muscles that will help you burn more calories during the course of the day, and second, larger abdominal muscles tend to stretch the skin around them, tightening your belly and reducing the amount of belly that sags over your waist line.<br>  <br>  But here’s the catch: only working your abdominal muscles isn’t going to do much for you. You should definitely consider joining a gym and working on a weight lifting routine that works as many of your muscle groups as possible, and a daily aerobic routine to help you burn the fat you already have.|`|Chib4b8saa	Do lots of cardio to start with, so that you can burn off the fat; as you start to lose some of it; start doing crunches and abdominal work to build your abs; the muscle will help to burn the fat that is left.

Eat right and be healthy.  The most important thing however is to get lots of calcium to support bone growth so you actually can grow taller and to sleep alot.  You grow most when you sleep.  I'm a pretty tall fellow, I'm 6 foot 5 inches, when i was 1 year old they did some test to see how tall I was going to be.  Well the test said I was going to be 6 foot 3 inches, so the test was off by 2 inches.  Theres a chance you could be 5'9 or taller. If I knew more about you I could give you a better answer.

sJUhwxBxaa	You made a valiant effort on the spelling :) (It's dYsmorphic.)<br>  Fortunately, if you are asking because you think you have then you probably don't, as most people who have an imagined physical defect do not know that it is imagined. <br>  If, however, you are asking out of concern for someone else, the signs can vary greatly from person to person.<br>  Look for:<br>  --Engaging in repetitive and time-consuming behaviors, such as looking in a mirror, picking at the skin, and trying to hide or cover up the perceived defect <br>  --Constantly asking for reassurance that the defect is not visible or too obvious <br>  --Repeatedly measuring or touching the perceived defect <br>  --Experiencing problems at work or school, or in relationships due to the inability to stop focusing about the perceived defect <br>  --Feeling self-conscious and not wanting to go out in public, or feeling anxious when around other people <br>  --Repeatedly consulting with medical specialists, such as plastic surgeons or dermatologists, to find ways to improve his or her appearance.<br>  (Warning signs of BDD taken from WebMD)<br>  <br>  Please remember, everyone has hang-ups about certain parts of their appearance.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|TVoqkuiBaa	i would go for a short run and then do do situps, crunches, etc. if you do them all after another you burn more calories and will lose not weight,<br>  <br>  also try this: at basketball practice we do this thing and its really just  sitting down and then raising our bent legs together above the ground and touching the ground on either side with your hands<br>  <br>  if you aalso dont eat breakfast and dinner your metabolism will slow down, so just eat a little something like maybe a glass of orange juice or an  apple|`|SLU0iTVHaa	if your fifteen your not geting enough food/ nutrients you are barley eating as is.. i think you need to step it up with proteinand vitamins eat a little more and start walking or jogging Daily|`|xjjkVqwTaa	do lots of running and jogging|`|el2blDi4aa	eat

GHQyH4pMaa	I started it in April last year for panic attacks and anxiety. I felt worse for the first 3 weeks or so. Then, all of a sudden it started helping. I started at 10mg and since then, I've upped it to 30mg and it has helped tremendously! It can actually take up to 6 weeks to work. I would give it a couple more weeks and if it's not helping, either up the dose or change to something else. I've weaned back down to 10mg only because I gained 40 lbs. and lost my sex drive. At 10mg, I have my sex drive back and I have lost a few pounds. As far as when you should take it, it really doesn't matter for me, as long as it's within 4 hours the same day.

A build up of testosterone will make you hornier and more aggressive, of course, and that's probably the difference you feel.

kGJND4lYaa	If your boyfriend is truly bipolar and/or schizophrenic, and he is only being prescribed an antidepressant, he is not being properly treated.<br>  <br>  The antidepressant will NOT help with manic, psychotic, hallucinatory, or delusional episodes. Think of the disorder as a line, going from depression to manic/excited/psychotic. Unmedicated, he goes back and forth from one end of the line to the other. If he only takes lexapro, he will ONLY stay in  the manic part. This is probably the part that affects your relationship in a bad way.<br>  <br>  Bipolar and schizophrenic disorders are "chemical input" problems, i.e. stem from heavy-metal poisoning, other pollution, or a nutritional problem.

kB4EJUKgaa	9.8 is pretty low. 14 is a good average. Lots of things can influence your hemoglobin. If you are anaemic, you'll have a typically lower blood count. My mom was anaemic and every time her blood was low she had to get a blood transfusion. Bleeding internally or externally somewhere can also lower your blood count. I'd go to the doctor and get it checked out.|`|UlNU2Iydaa	A blood count takes an inventory of everything in your blood, and makes sure everything is within the normal levels or production.<br>  <br>  You are missing a key word in your question that will narrow down what your blood count means. There are three components of your blood count that are especially measured called your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. If you have a low red blood cell count would mean you may have anemia (low iron), and as a result you may suffer from oxygen insufficiancy. If you are low on white blood cells this means that there is a problem with your immune system. A high white blood cell count would most likely mean you are fighting an infection, if it is low, there could be serious consequences if it gets low enough. Platelets are the cells that stop you from bleeding, so if those are low, you won't be able to easily form scabs. This could lead to prolonged bleeding of minor wounds or worse if the count is low enough. <br>  <br>  I found a chart listed on the second link below, and it shows the normal ranges for a complete blood count for each cellular structure in your blood. I couldn't seem to find anything that your number would fit under that would was in the same ball park but lower than normal range than any of the numbers on the chart. The red blood cell count is in the range of your number, but if it was red blood cells your count will be on the high end of normal, so I doubt that is it.. <br>  <br>  I guess you could talk to you doctor to get more information, or look for yourself and see what you come up with. Below is the information I used, and hopefully it will help you start your research.<br>  <br>  I hope your levels come up to normal, and that you get better soon!<br>  <br>  Edit: If it is low hemoglobin, (just noticed that one is within range), that would just mean you are low on iron, and your red blood cells won't be able to carry as much oxygen to your body as normal. You need to eat foods with moderate amounts of iron to increase your hemoglobin. Hope it is something that simple..|`|AA12358000	Aussygirl87,<br>  As you have only quoted 9.8 and not to what it related, I am unsure to what you refer.

There are not any high pressure arteries to the tongue.  it is essentially a muscle like any other, and they will ooze blood rather than squirt.  Incidentally, I have seen many seizures, and old care was to use a bite stick so that they couldn't bite their Tongue off.  Recent first aid though does not advocate using a bite stick.  I am not sure if anyone has actually ever bitten their tongue clear off.|`|c0a23f9219dea0c956fbebca1fda8189aa	Seizures have been around for thousands of years and our bodies have a way of making sure that things like that don't happen.  Can they still happen?  Yep, but only in extremely rare cases.  Usually what happens is part of your tongue gets bitten, not off, just bleeding. People usually don't have there tongues hangin out of there heads.  When you are going to have a seizure, you kinda feel it coming.  People with seizures call it," an aura".  When people feel that, they usually don't have there tongue sticking out there head.  Again, can it happen?  Yep. Sure can.  Your tongue however is a big piece of meat.  Could you completely bite off a piece of meat from a steak in one bite?  Probably not.  Partially?  yeah. So thats the most common types of damage that could happen with a seizure tongue injury.|`|bDKM69HBaa	Biting your tongue completely off would result in a fairly large mount of blood, but not enough to end fatally.

Use a loofah or synthetic sponge to apply an exfoliating agent containing salicylic acid.<br>  Step3<br>  Treat infected hairs by stretching the skin gently with the thumb and forefinger to remove any pus and expose the hair. Sterilize a pair of pointed tweezers with hydrogen peroxide and use them to remove the hair by the root. Dab a little hydrogen peroxide or aloe vera on the area to prevent infection.<br>  Step4<br>  Stop shaving and waxing until the skin is no longer irritated.

hhWDHmfyaa	No, not true.  But close.<br>  <br>  Fiber is necessary to burn the fats you digest.  It also assists in digestion so that you are optimizing the nutrients you ingest while assisting in the removal of the waste products of foods.<br>  <br>  Fiber is necessary to all bodily functions as it assists in regulating the sugar level.  The more steady (not high or low) your sugar level, the more efficiently you can burn calories.<br>  <br>  Also, there is a huge tie in between fiber and cancer-free.  Many Universities are currently studying why countries whose diets typically contain 21 grams of fiber daily have close to zero rates of cancer.<br>  <br>  It is the Miracle food.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	no that is just a myth|`|NgnbtaORaa	Fiber speeds up the digestion of food.  I wouldn't say that eating fiber cancels out the amount of fat you eat in a day though - that sounds wrong to me.  Fiber aids your bodies digestion and that in turn speeds up your metabolism so your body will shift more fat by eating fiber than not eating fiber - that is absolutely true.|`|4mXqv6IZaa	Nothing cancels out the amount of fat you eat.  There are some products that bind with fat and reduce the amount absorbed into you body.  I hear people ask me all the time, "how can I lose weight without changing my diet or exercising?".  There is no way to do this.  If you truly want to lose weight, you need to change your habits such as eating and exercising.  30+ minutes of cardio per day is a good place to start.  Eating a heart healthy diet reducing fat more than calories.  Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean protein and water.  People underestimate the importance of water.  You should drink 1/2 your body weight in ounces of water per day.  A quick example, if someone weighs 200 lbs they should drink a minimum of 100 oz of water per day.  Skip the soda and sugary snacks.  Hope this helps a little.

Yes I agree that no sex is a way to ensure that you do not get pregnant but do remember that even oral sex carries its risks. <br>  Once the penis is erect there are already sperm there on the end of the tip! Therefore oral sex and fingering carries its own risks of getting you pregnant - you only need to touch the penis then touch the vagina and you are being risky. <br>  Simple answer is - if you want to have sex make sure that <br>  a) it is consentual on both sides (don't be forced into it under any circumstances) <br>  b) you use protection (a condom is best as it reduces the chance of both pregnancy and STI's)<br>  c) you are willing to take the risk that you MAY become pregnant as nothing is 100%<br>  <br>  We are not saying don't have sex - we are asking you to be responsible for your actions if you do

XTepTcoCaa	?<br>  ? Professional Tooth Whitening Success ?<br>   Affordable Teeth Whitening Services<br>   Two major types of tooth whitening techniques were discussed in the article.<br>     Your teeth can be whitened in many different ways by a dentist. They are grouped into external techniques and internal techniques.<br>   <br>   In external techniques, as the name implies, involves placing the whitening gel on the outer surface of your teeth. However, this method do not work for some types of staining like those caused by metal fillings or condemned blood vessels inside the teeth. External whitening can be done in two ways, namely home tooth whitening and Laser (power) tooth whitening.<br>   <br>   In home tooth whitening, your dentist designs a rubber mouth guards precisely for your teeth. Then you will be given tubes of tooth whitening gel. Your dentist will give you detail instructions on how to apply the gel in the mouth guards.<br>   <br>   <br>   ?Teeth Whiten Tips<br>    In laser or power tooth whitening, your dentist will insert a rubber seal around your teeth in other to protect your gum. Hence, the tooth whitening gel is applied to your teeth such that the gel paints your teeth. A special type of bright light is directed to your teeth. The role of the light is to speed up the whitening processes. It can take up to one to two hours for good result.<br>   <br>   Internal tooth whitening involves the placing of the tooth whitening gel inside the tooth. This procedure is strictly for teeth that has been root treated successfully<br>   <br>   So in internal tooth whitening, the dentist drills a hole in the tooth and put the tooth whitening gel inside the hole. For front tooth, the hole is normally made at the back of the tooth where it is not easily seen. Then he will seal the hole with temporary filings, while he leaves the gel inside the tooth. This process does not hurt because there is no nerve inside the tooth.<br>   <br>   Then in a week later you will need to go back to the dentist to remove the temporary filling and tooth whitening gel. Now, if the new shade of your teeth is ok with you, your dentist will use a tooth colored filling to fill the hole. In some cases you might ask your dentist to repeat the procedure if you are not satisfied with the new color shade. Some times internal tooth whitening might require other types of whitening techniques to get your desired effect.<br>   <br>   Charles is a technical writer for <a href="http://toothwhitening.fateback.com" rel="nofollow">http://toothwhitening.fateback.com</a> - A free site that offers info on the problems and solutions regarding the different teeth whitening techniques.<br>   ?<br>  Tooth whitening<br>   Tooth Whitening Information<br>   ?<br>   ?<br>   ?

This is not very successful and often needs to be repeated, thats why most dentists won't do it.  Every time you open that tooth up you risk disturbing the root canal and having it fail, which would require extraction of the tooth.  Your best option is having it crowned. Teeth that have had root canal usually require crowns anyway because the tooth becomes brittle over time and has a high fracture risk.  So by crowning you would achieve two things:  ensure long life of the tooth, and improve color.|`|xbZ6V6Q1aa	You can try IvoryWhite Teeth Whitening, they promise you to give 5 shades in 5 days, you can read the review here <a href="http://teethwhiteningstars.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teethwhiteningstars.com/</a>

uVMlNvLoaa	Sometimes on the IUD you will have unexpected bleeding/spotting. It's perfectly normal, even in a span of no periods.

sREUJDE5aa	It is recommended to exercise at least 3 days a week.<br>  <br>  You can also do more then this.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend vigorous exercise for about 30 minutes|`|r1fLDlhCaa	People who tye LIKE THIS scare me. and what kind of muscle problems be more specific please.
HdoB3bejaa	How long did you leave the tampon in?  If you were not on your period and left the tampon in for a long period of time then you could have caused a little bacterial infection in your vagina.  If it was around the time you would normally ovulate (12 to 14 days after the first day of your last period) then the spotting was mostly due to that.<br>  <br>  As far as using tampons, just make sure you follow the directions and dont leave them in too long.  Using them DOES increase the likelyhood of getting vaginal infections, but as long as you keep your body clean and follow the directions on how to use them you should be fine.  Have you asked your mother why she doesn't want you using them?  Ultimately, you have to use whatever works best for you when  you are on your cycle. YOU have to deal with you monthly and YOU should be able to pick what you want to help you thru that time.|`|Qbjpft5aaa	yeeah. i'll bet your fine, maybe just your period.<br>  idk why you put it in when you werent on your<br>  period, it must have hurt like a mother to take out!<br>  if it did, it doesnt normally hurt that bad! lol. dont worry.<br>  your perfectly fine. <3
Dhz4XgQ3aa	both these can be side effects of many medications. So if you have been taking anything check the side effects and see your doctor if they are unbearable to live with. <br>  If you are not taking any meds then go and see your doc anyway for peace of mind. its likely to be nothing or at least nothing serious. <br>  <br>  i am on quetiapine and lamotrigine and both those cause twitches nausea and weak muscles.

That is one of the main reasons that scarring is formed. Try to cover the acne up as much as possible and let it heal on its own.<br>  <br>  You also need to start a regiment to stop or reduce the acne. There is a wonderful product on the market right now that has helped a lot of people. The link below will take you to the site where you can purchase it. I believe they have a free trial so you have nothing to lose by trying it out.|`|F37Bi5YVaa	See the doctor.<br>  <br>  You don't have to live with acne scars for the rest of your life. There are surgical procedures that can smoothen your skin, progressively reducing the scarring with each treatment.<br>  <br>  Ice pick scars can be smoothened away with dermabrasion or laser resurfacing.<br>  <br>  Deeper scars can be hidden through augmentation.
f99f410d47123bf78dd5c13bff9bf849aa	I think you already know the answer to your question. Go to the doctor. No one on yahoo answers is going to be able to diagnose your problem. It sucks having to go to the gynecologist but at your age it's time for you to start getting pap smears and pelvic examine anyway. Don't worry you will get used to it. All women have to do it if they want to be healthy. And don't feel awkward  about requesting a female doctor if that would make you more comfortable ok?|`|sKTmxnx1aa	I would say that it's time for a trip to the doctor asap!  Hope this helps, and have a great day!|`|PMhR70Mgaa	It is probably related to diet. I often get bloated after lactose (milk, cheese, etc) and gluten (bread, etc.) Many people are developing sensitivities to both of these, so you may have one as well.<br>  <br>  Try taking both out of your diet for at least 3 days. If it doesn't help, I suggest seeing your doctor.<br>  Your period may also be related to stress. I am 17, and I know that my 16 y-o days we're VERY stressfull, and I missed a few periods.<br>  Feel better!
IEyYeBaWaa	you must be brushing your teeth somewhat well, bc if you weren't your orthodontist would have taken off your braces prematurely and told you.<br>  <br>  but to ur questions, yes you could get ur teeth whitened (bleached) and they would be whiter (my friend got this done after she got her braces off)<br>  <br>  and your other question...im not sure, but i think that teeth whitening would also help with that bc i think that it is highly unlikely that your enamel has worn away w/o ur ortho noticing.<br>  <br>  hope this helps! =)

AdTnizwOaa	*sigh* geez, everyone telling you to use a tampon, ugh.. i use a pad (my mom is weird she makes me and says it's not noticable, i agree with her.) Your period will probably be a little lighter so if you have thinner pads use that under your swim suit. (Don't worry you won't leave blood in the pool...and it won't be noticable either..trust me i have had experience. and have done it many times)<br>  <br>  Also, if you're still unsure, what i normally do also when i have a heavy period is i put on my swimsuit and pad underneath, and i put swimming shorts over it. No one will question it, it's cute and it helps you feel confident. ahh..it sucks being a girl.<br>  <br>  So if you have any girl swimming shorts lying around, wear 'em! Or if you don't i suggest getting them until then or just wear that pad underneath your swimsuit and live with it. But i really hope you consider the swimming shorts.|`|OFgXjyilaa	Ooh it's horrible when your period comes when you have something fun to look forward to. All the joy of growing up!!  Is that the date you are due to start you period?? If you start a few days before  then I would go buy a multipack of tampons, with mini, regular and super and as weird as it may sound have a practice using them. They can be quite tricky to master at first!! Make sure that you use the right one for your cycle, normally you would start with the yellow one (regular flow). Only use these when you are actually on your period though and make sure you change it every four hours. Towels won't work if you are to go swimming so don't use them in the water at all. If your period is particularly heavy I would forget the swimming. Sometimes it sucks being a girl. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you hunny. :0)|`|zBmno58kaa	If you're not going to use a tampon, then no, you don't need to go.

Plus, it's unsanitary, honey...<br>  <br>  You can't go swimming w/ a pad, because the pad will absorb water like a diaper and bulk up under your bathing suit.  Hope I helped some.|`|tb67ss8Naa	use a tampon. I know it is scary the first time, but it is the safest way. Just be sure to remove it after seven hours.|`|OKf1kGWBaa	You need to use a tampon.  When I was young, I got my period during swimming lessons. I also didn't have any interest in using a tampon, plus I had no idea how to use one and wasn't comfortable asking my mom or sister.  I bought some and locked myself in the bathroom, surprisingly, it was hard for me at first, but I got the hang of it.  (There are directions in the box)  I would definitely get a very small one first with a soft tapered tip.  You cannot feel them at all if you put them in properly.  Give them a try, otherwise you'll have to give up activities due to your period for the rest of your life. Good luck!|`|9a8557PAaa	Im sry to hear tht your mom is no longer with us. I hope tht you have an aunt, grandma, or female friend tht you can talk to when us yahoo answer people aren't around. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, if you still have your period on friday and you don't wear tampons(neither do i), you CANT go swimming. You will bleed all in the pool and have a huge mess! Not to mention how embarrased you will be.<br>  <br>  Thats just the price you pay when it's that time of month cuz you don't use tampons. <br>  <br>   Have a good day and remember don't go swimming unless your period stops before then!|`|QhfwmYVkaa	sorry to break it to you honey, but you got to either wear a tampon or not go in at all and watch all your friends enjoying the pool and having fun without you.

Its scary and hurts a bit on first time but that's normal.|`|udk7yYj0aa	Awhh Im Soo Soo Soo Sorry To Hear About Your Mother..=( But If You Want To Go Swimming That Badly Your Gonna Have To Wear A Tampon...There Are Onesz That Can Help You Insert In The Right Area. =P Lool...Das Embarrassin..But Noo...Use Tampons...You Can Get A Variety =D...&& There Are Lots For Young Girls As Well...Maybe They're Moree Better && Comfertable...<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped <br>  <br>  <3|`|vGJ5rD8Caa	Everybody is right dont go swimming without a tampon. been there done that dont wanna go back. *sigh* it really isnt hard. trust me. there r instructions in the box and it is super easy to folow. good luck!|`|IojSGAPJaa	There is no way you can go swimming without a tampon in.|`|qYKjqZxOaa	No!<br>  don't go swimming<br>  unless you will wear a tampon.|`|HHyny0JSaa	I wouldn't wear a pad in the pool unless you want to watch it float by in the water. Tampons are made for activities such as swimming. Plus a big old pad is going to be noticible under a bathing suit.|`|QJHE3z1raa	only way to go   is a tampon<br>  they arnt that bad
h5xSfcT6aa	yeah just go for the next absorency up, thats fine! im the same as you, and found that the next absorbency, super plus are a lot bigger and are harder to put in, so i only use them at nights and super plus extra on VERY heavy days, as they are really quite big. i just use super on average days.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  xxx|`|zp0DpAataa	Go onto the super plus absorbancy you'll feel more confident about less risk of leaking. Just change them regularly as you do now. Tampons can carry a risk of TSS but its extremely rare if you change them regularly,try not to keep them in for over 8 hrs.|`|2QtnKQ5kaa	That sounds about normal actually.  It doesn't sound like a heavy flow at atll to me.  Many women, a super sized tampon lasts about that long.  Virginity has absolutely NOTHING to do with tampon use.  You can use a super plus sized tampon if you want-- its your body, its up to you.|`|qYKjqZxOaa	It is perfectly normal to have a really heavy flow.<br>  just get the next asorbency it might last longer <br>  if not try tampons? if you use pads.|`|fvmwa8coaa	Of course.<br>  The only risk of using a higher absorbency tampon is that it raises the risk of TSS.|`|j7fzuDxgaa	yes you could use the next one but you must change regular or you risk toxic shock. but they are very safe as long as you use them right
RAP6Nn6Naa	It obsorbes to its fullest capacity and it hurts really bad when you pull it out.  Kinda brings on some intense cramps|`|zBmno58kaa	No, because eventually it gets so soaked that I can feel it up in there and that reminds me to take it out.|`|Hwlzaulpaa	No!  Get it out.  It can cause infection and not to mention, stink out the place!  Go to the doc if you can't retrieve it.
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, it could possibly cause problems with the lungs like asthma (an example only).<br>  <br>  One place you may be able to find more information about this is at: <a href="http://www.WebMD.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.WebMD.com</a><br>  <br>  I would also recommend checking with your doctor when you go in for your next check-up to see what they say.

ftIfrAAaaa	well dear if you lost your voice and u are sick, then you are sick and have lost your voice! i don't think that your parents will think that you are faking if you have to go to the doctor, so if you are unable to go to the doctor i think you should stay home and make it your business to see the doctor the same day, it could be more serious then you think. i would stay home and rest, but if you really don't feel that bad then go to school. they might just send you home anyway if its that serious.|`|BEOuGIF4aa	just tell them, start crying too, it helps alot :)<br>  <br>  <br>  dont go to school, i wouldnt.|`|SMVsmzi4aa	you should mope around and act like ur in pain, and then if u still feel like crap tomorrow then, stay home. whats the point of going somewhere, when your sick? u wont be able to concentrate.|`|7zHrBkY2aa	If ur normally honest with them they should believe you<br>  <br>  i had that happen to  me last week, i just got ALOT of sleep and my voice was normal, but for different people <br>  <br>  good luck with ur throat! :) i wouldnt go to school|`|lyMMjVNgaa	Id get checked out <br>  dont go to school<br>  feel better :)|`|6yYMUwQmaa	write it down for them if u try to make some attempt of talking i bet they will believe you|`|Tb07GxQBaa	well tell them that if you go to the doctor and nothing is wrong you will have reason to be mad at me but if it alright in the morning tell them that right away so you don't get caught going to the doctor when you better|`|hxDA7Eutaa	just say you don't feel well and stay on the couch all day do your hw watch tv and just tell them how you feel|`|srj3LwHvaa	drop out of school :]

PAvYZJK2aa	no foreskin cover|`|TsjqzanQaa	A circumcised penis looks scarred and mutilated and partial.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has been amputated, usually very sloppily, and the scars can range anywhere from just under the glans on the shaft to 1/2 or 2/3 of the way down the shaft, nowhere near, in fact, where the foreskin actually was.<br>  <br>  Circumcision cuts off about half of the normal penile skin.<br>  <br>  On an infant, they don't take into consideration that an infant's penis grows, and then after puberty the penis grows with erections, so frequently victims of circumcion have tight, distorted and sometimes painful erections.<br>  <br>  The glans of the circumcised penis has a dry, dull texture, and becomes almost leathery after years of exposure, unlike the satiny-smooth glans of the normal and natural unmutilated and uncircumcised male.<br>  <br>  I have one friend in my restoration support groups who decided to get circumcised when he was 18.     After going through 20 years or so of keratinization of the glans, the reduced sensitivity was so much that he restored his foreskin, and said that he wished he had never had it done.<br>  <br>  It's not just appearance, the mutilation of circumcision always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Most men in the world are uncircumcised, and they're quite happy with it.     Very, very few men ever choose to have it done to themselves.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|Yb99bIdnaa	Not all foreskins start out the same, and not all circumcisions are the same. So there's some variability in the outcome.<br>  <br>  In general, a circumcised penis has a head that's always exposed, though there may be a bit of loose skin left, particularly when soft. It varies from one guy to the next.<br>  <br>  Why do you ask?|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Usually none of the head is covered. It's been described as a "Purple Mushroom."<br>  I could cover it, there's no skin on the head but i can still pull skin down and cover it if i want. It won't stay that way.. but i can do it. Not all guys have enough skin to pull down.<br>  It looks exactly like an uncircumcised one when "ready for action".|`|i6RlYFo7aa	a circumcised penis has no protective skin on the head, it also has a scar and it looks dry<br>  <br>  a natural penis that is not circumcised has about half an inch of skin covering the head|`|E64juLwJaa	Then there is no more foreskin :it has been removed<br>  So you cannot pull it back because there is nothing to do that with<br>  Colors.|`|AA11522944	An intact (uncircumcised) penis will have the foreskin covering or partially covering the glans (head) of the penis when the penis is flaccid (soft).<br>  <br>  If circumcised the glans of the penis is totally or mostly exposed when the penis is flaccid.<br>  <br>  Both circumcised and intact penises can look similar when erect.<br>  <br>  See the links below.<br>  <a href="http://medicalimages.allrefer.com/large/circumcised-vs-uncircumcised.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://medicalimages.allrefer.com/large/...</a><br>  <br>  Circumcised - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Flaccid-erect.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Flacc...</a><br>  Intact (not circumcised) - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Erection_Homme.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Erect...</a>|`|AA12034729	circumsized generally doesnt have any skin to pull over the head.

The abs will come.|`|MzCL0dzjaa	No. It's marketed to people who are to lazy to put any real effort into getting abs. If it worked everyone would be ripped right now.<br>  <br>  The key to abs is having a low body fat %. 95% of your abs are just from diet alone.|`|3SF1deXraa	Don't waste your time or money on these types of contraptions.  I believe in eating a recommended calorie intake per day and staying active.  I reduced my calories to 1800 per day and started going to the gym 3 times a week.  I started in mid January.  I lost a couple of pounds.  I felt like the pounds weren't coming off quickly enough.  I looked into Alli.  I started taking Alli about a week ago....and it's been amazing.  It blocks 25% of fat from being absorbed by your body.  In this one week, I've lost 7 pounds and 2 inches from my waist.  Some people are scared of this product because of "treatment effects," but I've had none because I'm sticking to 18 grams of fate per meal.  Read up on Alli and take the quizzes they offer.  You'll be amazed!

If he is looking a little chubby maybe he could cut back on snacks and not eat in between meals. Remember growth takes fuel so a really restricted diet is not a good idea.

9pLdhuBnaa	It could be part of your lymph nodes (an example only), however, I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.
7GrncwiYaa	These could be symptoms of many things. I think of thyroid imbalances, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, hormone imbalances ...

USoqyjaAaa	Malaria is very dangerous to a fetus, although as you say if you are pregnant it would be in the early stages.  You should discuss this with your physician.  He or she will probably recommend that you be treated, with a drug that is known to be safe in pregnancy.  In the meantime if it turns out you are not pregnant you will probably want to hold off on trying to conceive until the treatment is complete.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	And how would malaria affect your possible fetas?

dpgXzMenaa	Depends what you mean by "horrible".<br>  <br>  Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Only a urinary tract infection would hurt when you urinate, a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis wouldn't hurt because it deals with your vagina.  Talk to your mother about what is going on, how can she help you if you don't tell her?  Don't be embaressed, she has a vagina too, she sorta knows what is going on.|`|inA6ZLeAaa	It doesnt matter you can still have a yeast infection if you have a foul smell.|`|RgEtKVaKaa	Have you taken a antibiotic lately?  Sometimes you get a yeast infection after taking an antibiotic because the antibiotic kills the bad bacteria you want it to kill & it also kills the "good" bacteria you don't want it to kill.  When good bacteria is killed, other things can grow - like yeast in the vagina.  It is perfectly normal but not too nice.  Do you have itching?  Usually yeast itches- a lot!!  Did you leave a tampon in place?  Check to see - sometimes that happens.  You are only 14 so I am going to assume that you are not married & do not have sex.  If I am wrong then there could be other things going on.  You need to talk to your mom or another trusted adult female.  If your mom loves you, you should talk with her.  That's what we mom's do - help our kids.  Hurry so you don't have to worry about this any longer.|`|juMy8eHraa	ok lemme get this straight ur to imberresed to ask mum so ur gonna go and put the question on teh internet where everyone can see|`|4rZFtWXIaa	Oh np hun try to wash it longer with soap thats all your washing it now im sure but try to put more soap use a bar of soap not shampoo hope it works.|`|AA10799478	you could have a yest infection, its nothing to be embarrassed about i'm sure ur mum will understand she is a women after all.|`|p0zqrXi4aa	eat pinapple<br>  <br>  trust me!!!<br>  <br>  i ate alot when i had a bad smell down there...i had pinapple and the smell went away after 1 week

Your brother should be more conscientious about cleaning up after himself.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	it is dry semen|`|M63kq3AYaa	Sounds like it. Not much you can do about it though. He was probably aiming in and missed, which although the missing is messy, at least he was trying to do it hygienically.|`|E64juLwJaa	It dries up like white paper only thinner<br>  Colors.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	why dont you ask him? or have him clean it|`|DT80y28Maa	eww|`|GvEsaVYeaa	Sounds like a mold, actually<br>  Dried semen looks flat and has a matte texture. As for color, that changes from person to person. It may be white for one, while it is clear for another. <br>  If you do believe it is dried semen, talk to your brother. Either ask him to find a different masturbation spot, or start cleaning it up after he is done. If he refuses, tell your parents, or get into a discussion about his penis. He would just 'love' that. Trust me, there is nothing worse than talking to a sister about those things.|`|y2XKYhsyaa	more than likely. haha.|`|BTcQuHRmaa	It does sound like dry sperm.|`|uXg8xJiwaa	It was definitly it.

My fiance gets really bad break outs and he finds that when he uses an all natural face wash that is clears his skin up in a quickness(normally 1-2weeks)and it's all better again. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should give it a try<br>  <br>  Megan|`|w8M2uAdbaa	I think that it is probably a combination of the two. Not eating meat probably would do much, but i would suggest washing your face a couple times a day if you get the chance and maybe put some lotion or whatever on it, i have acne to as well, not bad, but still. Did you know acne is considered a disease?!
LOROVDvcaa	they may come to a state where they believe they are content with being miserable or in need of help.  they may realize that they can get by on their own and getting help would only complicate their lives.  i'm not sure if anyone can be "beyond help" but i'm sure some people certainly feel that they are.  i have been in a circumstance where i did not want help, some suicidal people feel that way also|`|6NA2MXNPaa	If you're talking physiologically, then yes, it's possible. If someone has cancer and they've done chemo, radiation, and a bunch of other things and yet the cancer is still progressing, then obviously there will be nothing left for the doctors to do and the person will be made comfortable and left to die. If you're talking psychologically, I don't think anyone could be beyond help, I think there are always options for treatment. There are medications, counselling, electro-convulsive therapy, self-help books, and on and on and on. There are so many different options available for people with psychological issues that I don't think that you could ever be out of options or beyond help. I think part of that is because doctors don't fully understand psychological disorders and there aren't any cut and dry methods for dealing with psychological disorders like there are for physiological disorders. <br>  <br>  Of course you could convince yourself that you don't want help, you can convince yourself of pratically anything. But that doesn't mean that you would then be beyond help. You just have to then convince yourself that you're worth the help and that you can let your guard down and get the help you need. If you think of it like this, your thinking is what got you into whatever situation you're in now, so if you let someone else enter your life and let them make some decisions for you (like a therapist who directs you in a different direction) your life may change, until you're able to make decisions on your own that lead to happier times. You just need to be willing to accept the help that is offered to you. I hope that makes sense and I hope that helps a little. Good luck, take care!|`|AA10892706	Technically, yes someone can be beyond help. There are folks out there with severe depression that NO meds help and NO other type of treatment helps. This is called "treatment resistant depression".<br>  <br>  But in terms of what you are describing, it sounds like you really do want help. Don't ever be afraid to ask for that.|`|lYkvps54aa	If they don't want any help then yes i suppose that they are beyond help. on a medicinal sense, if the treatment that they have been having for a set period isn't working  and there is nothing more they can do, then its the same result.<br>  <br>  if that makes any sense.
f8mLpPXlaa	No, it just sounds like the regular old miserable cold.

It can often be a sign of a health problem and isn't something to make fun of.  <br>  <br>  I will assume that you are a healthy weight for your height and that the weight loss isn't intentional (you probably wouldn't be asking about it if it was!).  If you are losing weight for no reason, it could be anything ranging from a simple routine change to a fluctuation, to a symptom of a more serious problem.<br>  <br>  At its best, the weight loss is due to a change you made to your routine or normal fluctuations.  If you are eating fewer calories or exercising in greater durations or intensity than before, you would naturally be losing weight due to a higher metabolism rate.  <br>  <br>  The weight loss may also be due to natural fluctuations.  I have found personally that my weight will vary between one and four pounds within even a couple of days (though this could be due to a cheap scale).  Typically, this is due to changes in the contents of the bowel and water weight variations.  The weight will not usually stay off, however.<br>  <br>  Some medications may cause weight loss, such as certain psychoactive drugs (I've lost weight while on Prozac).  If you are taking a new medication and have lost weight since then, talk to your doctor about changing the dose or switching to another medication.<br>  <br>  Weight loss is commonly a sign of a change in the body's metabolism, whether it be the pathways, available resources, or other processes involved.  Therefore, medical conditions that cause weight loss often affect some part of the metabolic process.  One condition is called ketosis, where ketone numbers in the blood are elevated due to the liver burning fat stored in the body.  Ketosis will occur if the body does not have sufficient nutrients to perform normal respiration (usually carbohydrates).  Some medical professionals don't consider ketosis a medical problem, but it can be an indicator of larger problems.<br>  <br>  Another potential problem could be an intestinal parasite.  Along with weight loss, parasites may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea or constipation, and chronic fatigue, while others remain asymptomatic. Tapeworms, roundworms, and pinworms are three classes of animal that latch onto the small intestine wall and drain nutrients from the host, often a human.  The eggs are present in uncooked meat (particularly pork), animal feces, and rarely soil.  A doctor will perform fecal tests in order to determine whether parasite eggs are present, and will start a regiment of medications if a parasite is found.  <br>  <br>  Many other conditions are possible, too many to list here.  If you go to a doctor, he will likely do a full exam and have blood work performed to identify any other symptoms along with the weight loss.<br>  <br>  Finally, it could simply be a case of poor diet.  An healthy, moderately active woman should eat about 1800 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight.  If you aren't getting this many calories, eating too many fast-burning carbohydrates, or not enough vitamins and minerals, your body will resort to burning fats, resulting in weight loss.  Do to the sudden onset of the weight loss, however, I doubt a diet change would be the result unless it was a dramatic one.<br>  <br>  Keep a record of what you have eaten or do eat over a few days, and estimate how many calories and nutrients you are taking in.  Go to a doctor as well and have them do a full exam as well as some blood work, and show them the food record as well.  This should get you going in the right direction to find out why you are losing weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6jcEtPPKaa	Are you eating ok? How many times a day?

In which case, you will always lose the most weight in the first two weeks, after which it will stabilise to something much slower and healthier. The reason for this is that body is shocked by the sudden reduction in calories, so uses up the most easily burnable reserves first as a defence mechanism. After that, your body realises that this is not a short term thing and digs in for the long haul, so your fat burn becomes slower.<br>  <br>  How much you lose in the first two weeks depends on two things: how much you weighed in the first place (the more overweight you are, the more weight you will lose in the first two weeks - it's all proportional), and how little you're eating. As a female you shouldn't be eating less than 1200 calories a day while dieting, if you don't want to damage your insides.<br>  <br>  If you're not on a diet and you've lost this much weight, then you should see a doctor. You might have a tapeworm or something.|`|6gCClXjyaa	Well, it depends on if you have been working towards loosing<br>  all this weight, if it is just shedding by itself, then you might<br>  want to check with your doctor as it could be serious. <br>  But, If you are active and a healthy person,then yes it is healthy .|`|AA11576485	Do you mean you've lost 1 stone 3 pound in 2 weeks?

SLSX6QQsaa	I also have this problem, especially when I am very tense and stressed out.  My doctor said its because while my body is trying to relax or sleep, my mind is still going a million miles an hour.

My condition has much improved since getting a job that doesn't require standing 9 hours a day.|`|AA11292692	It is called myoclonus.  Some people think it is a very mild form of epilepsy - other times some researchers think it is due to too low GABA which regulates anxiety/mood.  I had myoclonus until I started taking Klonopin for panic attacks.  Klonopin is also effective in alleviating myoclonus, so I killed two birds with one stone.  You might want to talk to your doctor about it - although it's not considered serious unless it interferes with movement intentions (walking, drinking,<br>  eating, etc.).

ZaxpQSO5aa	I've never been drunk either, but my best friends have. I've drank in small quantities, but I would advise you not to, and this is why:<br>  1) When my best friends were drunk, they ended up hitting eachother for fun, and then running around in their underwear. Luckily though, we were in the comfort of our own home. <br>  2) I went to a party once, and this really drunk girl threw up all over the carpet. I was disgusting. Everyone cleared out of the room and stayed away from her. She puked like, every hour for the rest of the night, couldn't walk straight and looked like crap. Everyone was really grossed out by her. Its kind of scary too, at least at the type of party I was at where there were tons of other things there, and a lot of much older people than me.<br>  3) Another friend of mine got drunk and gave this boy a *******, and somehow the whole school found out. Now everyone thinks shes a major slut.<br>  <br>  I'm 15 too, and I would suggest not drinking at all, or having nothing more than maybe a glass of alchohol mixed with soda. Don't do shots, because believe it or not, one shot of straight alcohol can get you drunk if you're not used to it. <br>  <br>  But.. if its just you and a couple really close friends, in the comfort of your own home, and you would be okay with potentially puking or making a fool out of yourself in front of them go ahead. Just be careful at big parties around people you don't know.<br>  <br>  But its easier to just smoke before the party. ;]<br>  Ignore that.|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	No just hold a cup of water and drink that all night no one will know the difference.

Due to stress (and from this it sounds like you stress a lot) you can (and will) miss your period. This has happened to me before and it is not a fun thing to go through. I also had my period screw around and had a period for 71/2 weeks long! So your period is NEVER going to be perfect all of the time. However, best thing to do is to go to your doctor and they will run a test to see if you are pregnant and if not they will put you on birth control both to prevent prenancy and to stop your period from going crazy (if you are already on birth control then missing a pill or taking it at the wrong time every day *they are time sensitive* can also screw you up).

The best thing for you to do is to take a pregnancy test.  My period is not always on time, and sometimes I may go a month or so without one b/c I have a irregular period, which is actually common.  I would suggest to go on birth control.  This will regulate your period and it's another preventative measure to take for contraception.  If you do go on birth control, it's always best to still use condoms.  It will increase your chances of not getting pregnant and condoms (besides abstinence) is the only way to protect yourself from STD's.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I would have taken a test weeks ago. You used protection but this needs to be ruled out. Also, its not uncommon to be irregular. My periods are very inconsistent.

0GdlS9a9aa	one thing that you may not know is that you can get another one from panties that you were wearing while you had the yeast infection.  I am not sexually active, at least for the past 8+ years and from experience have come to realize this can occur.  Buy new underwear and yes, it needs to be cotton.  Do not reuse the old underware, even the ones you wore during the treatment process.|`|c2JialgJaa	try wearing plain white underpants with a cotton lining, sometimes the cute underware that is colored and don't have cotton lining can cause these infections (I use to get them all the time too).  I actually quit wearing underpants all together except during my cycle and i quit using tampons cause they caused infections too.  So no color panties, and no tampons.  Try it see if it works for you.|`|MdPReJZPaa	u should go by gyanacologist. THis happens to every woman.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	see below - everything about Infections|`|AA10563860	do you take antibiotics?  If so you should try a daily routine of acidophilus pills.  Try it for a few months and if you get no infections...stick with it forever.  It is very safe and only positive effects on other issues.<br>  Plus its cheaper than doctor visits.|`|LUkxFE36aa	Yeast Infections or Candidasis occurs whenever something throws off the chemical balance of the vagina. If you are not sexually active you should consider a number of environmental factors that could be contributing to your problems, such as a high level of stress, extreme douching,. Another thing you should consider is the common mistake of confusing a yeast infection with a diagnosis of BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS. Bacterial Vaginosis is the overgrowth of either good or bad bacteria in the vagina. The discarge of both conditions can be mistaken for one another. No matter the case you should consult a gynocoligist as soon as possible, because if you do have an STI, untreated it could lead to sterility and even death ( as in the case with HPV). * If you are on a lot of antibiotics I also heard that can increase the chance of you getting an Yeast Infection. <br>  P.S. Ignore the commenter that says this happens to every woman. IT DOES NOT. It's a signal that your body is telling you that something is very wrong.|`|WPzaF2osaa	Sometimes there is no real cause for yeast infection except for PH imbalance and also bacterial colony change in your genitalia, like when you take antibiotics. It could be dietary. Some women have more yeast with high sugar intake. It could be from hormonal changes, use of perfumes, soaps etc. If persistent after full course of treatment, you need evaluation for diabetes and or immunodeficiency.|`|CB7QJO4uaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I know exactly how you feel!

KIP43MrRaa	I know the feeling! Just recovered from a dreadful cold myself.<br>  I say, put some vaseline on the dry lips, take a paracetamol for the head, and chew on a strip of airways to clear that stuffy feeling. (If you don't happen to have some airways handy, try rubbing some Vick on your chest, should clear the breathing through your nose, and help aid the stuffy head.) As for smelly of 'bed', give your face and hands a good wash and spray a bit of body spray/aftershave on yourself - should do the trick. <br>  <br>  And most deffinetly attend the music lesson, you've mostly likely to have been in bed all day feeling grotty, getting out will do you good!|`|geJM58L2aa	If you're feeling kind of better now I think you should take the night off to contine to rest so you can feel 100% better.

xvey8ixPaa	By the magnification that he had of his eye with his glasses on, he would be far sighted, or have a plus prescription.

That's for a different category!)
pvjZEIDRaa	As an athlete, if you have an immediate headache and headaches days later, you most likely have a concussion. If you play sports I would definitely say to go see a dr. about it, because if you hit your head again it can be very serious!! If you have other concussion symptoms like feeling nauseous right after hitting your head, or there is anything you can't remember before hitting your head then you need to see a dr. <br>  <br>  As for putting in a tampon and fainting...was this your first time doing it? If not, maybe you just fainted for some other reason...|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	sounds like it. <br>   why dont you call and tell your dr that you fainted and hit your head, they may want to check you since you are having pain 2 days later !|`|sOCLwxnFaa	yeah probably
dpgXzMenaa	So what?  You're not a pervert... whether this qualifies as masturbation or not.   You're normal.<br>  <br>  There's no such thing as "being too young" for that.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|HjZZGkZVaa	woah! tie your hands to the bed post! that is crazy! wear mittens when you sleep or something!|`|bppI7Pxzaa	When you get a boyfriend he will understand, if he don't well he's not worth it.<br>  What about seeing you doctor and asking for some advice.<br>  <br>  All the best x|`|AA11119739	If you put your hand anywhere near your lower region during sex I don't think your boyfriend would be upset about that that may work as a plus for you the only thing i would worry about if i were your boyfriend or if i were you I would worry about the hand down the underwear during that time of the month i do not want to by any chance see my girls blood hand coming up out of her bloomers no no no no no|`|GCjFPehGaa	awkward!|`|d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	oh|`|9a8557PAaa	um i dont know psycologically why anyone would do such a thing but im sure a psycologist would know.

ToILKl6waa	You seem like an imaginative person who knows what she wants. You should take pride in your understand in astrology. That's a tough concept for a number of people. <br>  <br>  To deal with your emotions, I advise you to record all your thoughts and feelings in a journal. Write down all of your dreams, aspirations, up and down days, interests with the planets, etc. Treat the diary as if it a comforting thing to turn to - a friend. Also, set goals for yourself and strive to attain them in baby steps. Reward yourself afterwards and focus only on your strengths and perhaps what you can improve on.

I really don't think you have anything to worry about if he "pulled out". Give it more time I am sure you will start you period.<br>  <br>  The symptoms you explained are not nothing to worry about.

More than likely a minor infection ie. yeast infection etc. <br>  <br>  Wait a couple days and if the dis-comfort get's worst. If so, go see a doctor. I seriously doubt it is anything catastrophic. If anything they will probably prescribe you some antibiotics and send you on your way and the "issue" will dissolve. To be on the safe side next time use PROTECTION.

Most teenagers masturbate more than that in a week. Don't worry about it. Myths state that what you are worried about, but this is incorrect. If it was true, you wouldn't see a single person that was tall. If you haven't gotten your growth spurt yet, then you just need to wait longer, you are still only 15.<br>  But don't forget to take into account your family height. If you have a tall family, then you may grow to be tall. Same if your family is short. You may even be a mutation in your family. Don't worry about your height, anyway. No one but bullies will care, and even in most cases they don't. Don't judge your size from others.

As a result, it<br>  shouldn’t be any surprise that even body parts and functions we deal with every day have bizarre<br>  or unexpected facts and explanations behind them. From sneezes to fingernail growth, here are<br>  100 weird, wacky, and interesting facts about the human body.<br>  The Brain<br>  The human brain is the most complex and least understood part of the human anatomy. There<br>  may be a lot we don’t know, but here are a few interesting facts that we’ve got covered.<br>  1. Nerve impulses to and from the brain travel as fast as 170 miles per hour. Ever<br>  wonder how you can react so fast to things around you or why that stubbed toe hurts right<br>  away? It’s due to the superspeedy<br>  movement of nerve impulses from your brain to the<br>  rest of your body and vice versa, bringing reactions at the speed of a high powered luxury<br>  sports car.<br>  2. The brain operates on the same amount of power as 10watt<br>  light bulb. The cartoon<br>  image of a light bulb over your head when a great thought occurs isn’t too far off the<br>  mark. Your brain generates as much energy as a small light bulb even when you’re<br>  sleeping.<br>  3. The human brain cell can hold 5 times as much information as the Encyclopedia<br>  Britannica. Or any other encyclopedia for that matter. Scientists have yet to settle on a<br>  definitive amount, but the storage capacity of the brain in electronic terms is thought to<br>  be between 3 or even 1,000 terabytes. The National Archives of Britain, containing over<br>  900 years of history, only takes up 70 terabytes, making your brain’s memory power<br>  pretty darn impressive.<br>  4. Your brain uses 20% of the oxygen that enters your bloodstream. The brain only<br>  makes up about 2% of our body mass, yet consumes more oxygen than any other organ in<br>  the body, making it extremely susceptible to damage related to oxygen deprivation. So<br>  breathe deep to keep your brain happy and swimming in oxygenated cells.<br>  5. The brain is much more active at night than during the day. Logically, you would<br>  think that all the moving around, complicated calculations and tasks and general<br>  interaction we do on a daily basis during our working hours would take a lot more brain<br>  power than, say, lying in bed. Turns out, the opposite is true. When you turn off your<br>  brain turns on. Scientists don’t yet know why this is but you can thank the hard work of<br>  your brain while you sleep for all those pleasant dreams.<br>  6. Scientists say the higher your I.Q. the more you dream. While this may be true, don’t<br>  take it as a sign you’re mentally lacking if you can’t recall your dreams. Most of us don’t<br>  Click to buy NOW!<br>  PDFXCHANGE<br>  www.docutrack.<br>  com<br>  Click to buy NOW!<br>  PDFXCHANGE<br>  www.docutrack.<br>  com<br>  remember many of our dreams and the average length of most dreams is only 23<br>  seconds–barely long enough to register.<br>  7. Neurons continue to grow throughout human life. For years scientists and doctors<br>  thought that brain and neural tissue couldn’t grow or regenerate. While it doesn’t act in<br>  the same manner as tissues in many other parts of the body, neurons can and do grow<br>  throughout your life, adding a whole new dimension to the study of the brain and the<br>  illnesses that affect it.<br>  8. Information travels at different speeds within different types of neurons. Not all<br>  neurons are the same. There are a few different types within the body and transmission<br>  along these different kinds can be as slow as 0.5 meters/sec or as fast as 120 meters/sec.<br>  9. The brain itself cannot feel pain. While the brain might be the pain center when you cut<br>  your finger or burn yourself, the brain itself does not have pain receptors and cannot feel<br>  pain. That doesn’t mean your head can’t hurt. The brain is surrounded by loads of tissues,<br>  nerves and blood vessels that are plenty receptive to pain and can give you a pounding<br>  headache.<br>  10. 80% of the brain is water. Your brain isn’t the firm, gray mass you’ve seen on TV.<br>  Living brain tissue is a squishy, pink and jellylike<br>  organ thanks to the loads of blood and<br>  high water content of the tissue. So the next time you’re feeling dehydrated get a drink to<br>  keep your brain hydrated.<br>  Hair and Nails<br>  While they’re not a living part of your body, most people spend a good amount of time caring for<br>  their hair and nails. The next time you’re heading in for a haircut or manicure, think of these<br>  facts.<br>  11. Facial hair grows faster than any other hair on the body. If you’ve ever had a<br>  covering of stubble on your face as you’re clocking out at 5 o’clock you’re probably<br>  pretty familiar with this. In fact, if the average man never shaved his beard it would grow<br>  to over 30 feet during his lifetime, longer than a killer whale.<br>  12. Every day the average person lo|`|IWmbwshTaa	my friend lauren can lick her elbow but i can too u have to drink this special drink to loosen up your joints u have to have a tsp of cinnamon bannana and strawberrys blended in a blender vanilla ice cream and rootbeer when you drink it there u go u can lick your elbow :) it works|`|3bpwLPxjaa	double jointed people can.  its like licking your nose or folding your tongue.  eith you can, or you cant.<br>  <br>  Tell your brother to try to touch his pinkies to his wrists and lick his collar bone.|`|fvmwa8coaa	My boyfriend can, but only because he can dislocate his shoulder.|`|7UfuqGmcaa	You can't so stop trying.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	I could but why would I?|`|M1TgnTR6aa	its suppose to be impossible.i bet my 8 yr old nephew 100$.i lost!!!<br>  i think that u have to double jointed!~|`|PUv9P28Haa	My freakish Bosnian friend can.|`|KepDI877aa	nope

kxTUSZ84aa	i can't tell if you are a boy or a girl, but either way, lip products can cause pimples around your lips, although i've never had one. i get pimples around my chin a little, and that's just a very common place. lots of oil around those areas, it's hard to prevent. all i can recommend is switching the product/chapstick/etc. you use on your lips, try vaseline. also, exfoliating helps too, plus it makes your skin really smooth! i use st. ives apricot scrub (there's lots of different kinds to pick from for specifics, but i use the one for acne/blackheads because it's better at scrubbing than the more mild ones even though i don't get lots of acne)|`|BG8vMyZjaa	If they don't go away see your doctor who might refer you to a dermatologist.|`|7TyttsPTaa	Dunno tbh. might just be a weird thing|`|thkNNDHsaa	YA IT DOES LOOK KINDA WEIRD...

I would get something done as it becoming a problem with leaking, something that a young person just doesn't need to worry about for another 50 years.  It could even be a cosmetic surgery thing.  Definitely get another opinion, especially from a doctor who has experience in similar conditions.

In the body, CRP plays the important role of interacting with the complement system, an immunologic defense mechanism.<br>  <br>  As a blood test, CRP is not specific.

The CRP blood test is relatively new and its significance has been the topic of much recent discussion in the medical community. The CRP blood test analyzes your blood for the presence of substances called C Reactive Proteins. The C Reactive Proteins are indicators of inflammation in the blood. The normal level of C Reactive Protein in your blood should be up to 4.9mg/L (4.9 milligrams per liter). This is level of C Reactive Protein in the average healthy person. The optimal level of C Reactive Protein in your blood would be under 2mg/L.<br>  <br>  U&E stands for urea and electrolytes, and is a measure of kidney function. The healthy kidney excretes urea and is important in maintaining the electrolyte balance of the body, the balance between such chemicals as potassium and sodium and the acid/alkali balance. <br>  <br>  Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is generated from muscle metabolism. Creatinine is produced from creatine, a molecule of major importance for energy production in muscles. Approximately 2% of the body's creatine is converted to creatinine every day. Creatinine is transported through the bloodstream to the kidneys. The kidneys filter out most of the creatinine and dispose of it in the urine. Because the muscle mass in the body is relatively constant from day to day, the creatinine level in the blood normally remains essentially unchanged on a daily basis. Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dl) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

PHzWq3anaa	The company will choose a name often based on the "generic" drug name or the chemical name (which is not the same thing).  It could also be an association with a disease state, or a treatment goal, etc.  For example, "Lipitor" comes from the word  "lipid" which means "fatty acid" or "cholesterol".  The drug is designed to reduce your cholesterol.  Ultimately, the FDA must approve the drug name.  For example, the newest anti-smoking drug was originally to be named "Champix", but the FDA didn't like that it had the word "Champ" in it.  So Pfizer changed the name to "Chantix", which the FDA approved.|`|S4soZUFCaa	Ritalin is a brand name. It's just a name the drug co. comes up with. Like Ford naming a car 'Fusion'.

zg2Ji3HWaa	As you are determined not to seek professional help, and "just don't" isn't the answer you are looking for. I can only honour that and try and answer your question the way you want it answered.<br>  <br>  The thing is, the less visible the place, the thinner the skin is, and the harder it is for you to see and control what you are doing (which let's face it is part of the ritual) and you could truly hurt yourself seriously which as you state is not your intention.<br>  <br>  So my answer to you is your knees. Just wear long skirts or trousers. If anyone sees the marks just say you skinned your knees, or your cat was being rowdy.<br>  <br>  One final and crucial bit of advice is whatever you are using to cut yourself with must not be anything like a razor blade. It is too easy to go too deep with such a sharp instrument.  What you choose to use MUST be disinfected with alcohol or boiling water prior to using. And finally, once you have finished cutting, you MUST apply neosporin ointment to the cuts.

LPO8RlVdaa	Heres the problem, you are going down the quick fix route like the rest of the idiots out there and are taking loads of 'supplements' without even understanding the training you are doing.<br>  <br>  You just need to excercise properly, and eat a good, healthy diet!!!<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|xRQAsGRAaa	Ah you hit what we like to call a "plateau". <br>  Many people have come to me claiming the same thing, and ask me to help them get over it. The first time someone came to me with this, I used them as my guinea pig to try out a few things to get over this plateau.<br>  The exercise that worked the best, is high-rep squats at the end of every work out.

Some people also claim it naturally increases testosterone levels, but I don't know if this is true(I hope it is).|`|WEHjGaVKaa	Scrap your current routine, go to the gym everday 3rd day and do a full fody workout with heavy compound exercises (squats, deadlift, bench press etc). Increase the weight or number of reps everytime. Make sure your getting plenty of rest and eating enough good food - whey powder is good, but nothing compares to a big beek steak!|`|bsPlYiPZaa	are you giving your muscles any rest?<br>  <br>  you could simply be over working them

VC7PyH53aa	Is the annual benefits maximum per patient or per policy?<br>  If it's per policy then you're making two dollars since it costs $748 and the annual maximum is $750.<br>  Plus it has an annual deductible of $150.00. That means you have to spend $150 before you can even see any money back.<br>  <br>  Better idea would of been a HSA (Health Saving Account) thorugh your employer if possible. You could of took the 750 plus 150 deductible and put it in the account. The full amount of money would of been available Jan. 2nd. You would also reap the benefits of before-tax savings so the $900 would of really only cost you $675.00 assuming you're in a 25% tax bracket. <br>  <br>  At first glance it doesn't seem like that good of a plan. Even though they say they cover major work at 50% any major work would probably run up to the annual max and you wouldn't receive 50% reimbursement. <br>  <br>  You're the one that will have to determine if the benefits are worth the money. You know better than anybody how you're wisdom teeth are. Will they have to be removed this year or a few years down the road. <br>  If it's a simple extraction thats appx $150-$200 per tooth. Will they all need to come out or just 1? <br>  Plaque would be handled by a simple cleaning. $75.00 - $125.00. <br>  <br>  You will have to do the math and make the determination. <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps: How are your wisdom teeth crowding you front teeth? Wisdom teeth are the very last tooth in the back - right, left, up and down.

It will be easier on her and she will be mad, but she will grow to love the fact and deal with it.

My blood pressure is 105/56.  Several of my brothers and sisters are in about the same shape.  The others have to take pills to reduce their blood pressure and control their heart rates.  Which of us are normal as an over all statistic?  You pulse is fine.  <br>  <br>  I walk for an hour a day.  I can't keep up the 4MPH rate any more.  In fact, its very difficult to attain it for even a short distance.  My legs start to hurt from a bad back. But, I can walk at 3-31/2 MPH hour all day.<br>  <br>  Check your pulse, it is a great indicator of your over all health.

Has your diet and/or eating habits changed (what are you eating before going to bed)? etc.|`|th5SfrB9aa	That often happens to me too, except I wake up at 3, 3:05, 3:04, or 3:06. I'm not sure the cause. It could be because of a noise, bathroom urge, achieving the minimum amount of sleep, or a common routine that you follow in the morning. It sort of depends on what time you get up. If you get up at five and are waking up around four/four thirty, it's because your body is used to the schedule and is prepared to start the day. If you have any level of stress, it could also be the trigger.

AA10301974	That depends on a lot of factors. At rest a person who is athletic can have a healthy heart rate of 45 beats per minute. An overweight person would be visiting the hospital if their heart rate ever made it to 45bpm. <br>  <br>  For American culture in general the normal heart rate for resting falls into the range of 60 to 90 with high 60s and low 70s would be the average. Higher than that is actually unhealthy, but common. <br>  <br>  Many other places in the world have cultures that cause the normal range to fall into 50 to 70 beats per minute. That would be in relaxed cultures were there is little stress or emphasis on being on time.  <br>  <br>  For exercise the rate can go up to 200 beats per minute for some people and still be healthy. Go much higher than that and most people will pass out or worse.|`|ZjhQ6PL8aa	About all your checking someone's pulse does is tell if it's too slow or too fast.

iF9tJy3Laa	Typically its quite normal for the limbs to "fall asleep" frequently throughout the day if one is not very active or is not in good physical shape.  Also ht reason this happens is poor circulation through the veins to that given spot.

8UTwY1bOaa	i went about the same thing last week, it was nothing<br>  <br>  but i think you should get it looked at or look at self examinations on youtube <br>  <br>  but i suggest doctors|`|oAAr4aEJaa	It's more likely to be your sperm duct than cancer, either way go get ur knackers looked at by a doctor|`|Chib4b8saa	You need to have it checked immediately! It could be a number of things and probably is something non life threatening; but never the less, it could be testicular cancer. The sooner it's found, the better the outcome. There was a guy who was only 18 in school to become a nurse or something; but he found a lump and it ended up being cancer; so please do have it checked out. Best of luck to you!|`|vmCkQFbLaa	if its on your ballsack then its just probably a cyst, only a few would be tumors...but check each nut and rub it around, feel every square inch and see if you feel any lumps on there, if there is GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR it might be a scar tissue or something else, god forbid but about you lump on ballsack thing, i would also go see a doctor...it should be that serious..<br>  GUYS RUB YOUR BALLS TO CHECK FOR CANCER!!|`|AA12020717	get it checked out by a doc but this could be just a fatty lump that sometimes appear.

NXYJxnc0aa	Early decay appears as a whiter area, we call this (incipient decay) This would not hurt since the enamel has no nerves. When decay spreads through the enamel into the dentin, it starts to turn brown/black. Sometimes it may not appear clinically brown or black though. The best way to tell is have your dentist take some x-rays and use their instruments to see if there are any tacky areas (indicating decay) Just to note, the white area could be something else, such as demineralization or fluorosis.|`|a1KqdXLXaa	Yes, a white spot could also be a cavity (but not necessarily).  It will not be painful until it is very advanced.  You should have it examined by a dentist.|`|3xoEFFOKaa	the black thing in the teeth is either dirt of food or a filling.<br>  cavities are yellow and look like mollers in fact u get cavaties<br>  from ur mollers. but u can ask ur dentist where ur mollers are and<br>  what they look like.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Cavities can hurt depending on how bad they are but their not just spots its a little hole too.

uX5hO3d8aa	If the weights are on your ankles, there isn't much added pressure on the knees or hips as others have stated.<br>  <br>  Most ankle weight are only 1 - 3 pounds. While it may not seem like much weight, be sure to slowly increase the amount of weight on each ankle. This will really help to develop your leg muscles and help you to burn more calories as it takes more force to move them.<br>  <br>  If your aerobics also require you to move your arms, wrist weights will also be beneficial for the same reason. Overall, they will make you stronger, more toned, and help to burn more calories.<br>  <br>  I know many fire fighter schools use weighted vests when training new recruits. This has the same effect. It makes their bodies more able to carry the weight and helps them stay in better shape.|`|sydaZ4Ziaa	they benefit you extremely when it comes to the actual workout, because having the weights on your ankles obviously adds more weight which means you burn more calories and gain way more muscle. <br>  the disadvantage tho would be you could damage your ankles, joints, and bones. you have to be careful not to turn your ankle the wrong way or it could do some serious damage.<br>  but if you can handle it, it will benefit your body by giving you a more rigorous workout.<br>  good luck : )|`|rXAUJtt1aa	If you want to lose weight it starts at diet.  Eat 5-6 smaller meals each day and understand a very basic concept....calories in...calories out.  Meaning that whatever food you take in and its caloric value must burned off...PLUS SOME...to lose weight.  You will lose one pound of body fat for every 3500 calorie deficit.  That means if you take in 1,800 calories in a day and burn 2,500...you will lose one pound in a five day period.|`|oWTXPtxwaa	wear them on your arms, so the weight is above your legs,that way you're legs are the ones working at it, if there at your ankles they just make you get weak ankles.|`|saBZQJMUaa	It will work out your muscles harder because of the extra weight and you will become more toned.  There are really good, but work up slowly!|`|oojO4WAraa	It could do more harm than good.  If your knees, hips or ankles start hurting, stop using the weights. The weights on your ankles can cause lots of stress on the knees and hips.

AxvG9B3waa	Unless you have  a family history of early-age colorectal cancer, this is very unlikely to be that. Given the stress, this is likely a manifestation of irritable bowel syndrome. A colonoscopy is not too dangerous on a 21 year old but is not probably indicated at this point. You could try increasing the fiber in your diet and see if that helps.<br>  <br>  Blessings|`|DunU13FNaa	have you looked up the condition called Celiac Sprue?<br>  It has to do with the food you eat, and how the body tries to deal with it. <br>  I wouldn't freak out too much, or jump to conclusions about colon cancer without going through alot alot alot of research and testing.<br>  Good luck is being sent to you through my screen!!!!

YKYh9Z72aa	there are several benefits to smoking marijuana but keep in mind that smoking is still damaging to your lungs..... just like cigarettes. check out the link it's really informative about the positive side of smoking pot. you're prolly gonna get a ton of idiotic answers on here from uninformed people..... that's just the way that our society works and i guess it's just proof that kids will believe whatever bs their teachers and psa's tell them without ever finding anything out for themselves. congratulations for being "above the influence" of others!|`|iF9tJy3Laa	there are none, you harm yourself but mostly you harm other people.|`|uJDPFp1Raa	I think the best benefit is that you get to enjoy a mild buzz that will NEVER kill you, or make you sick. Safer than alcohol.|`|dHg78Phdaa	how the **** do you harm other people? Thats some bull **** right there.<br>  <br>  The simultaneous opposing action of marijuana is akin to balancing our entire system. Such balance in the ANS can be understood as a charged equilibrium, which is defined as “well-being” experienced as physiological expansion and psychological contentment and responsible for health. (p. 29)<br>            The net effect is a highly functioning, yet relaxed, system with better fuel. This is why, with marijuana, the feeling is both relaxed and alert, which explains, in part, the experience of being “stoned.” Normally the body vacillates between the two opposing modes of being. The effects of the complicated marijuana molecule somehow actually integrate these two modes, simultaneously, as absolutely nothing else does. (p. 30)<br>            Although specific effects of marijuana in the body are well known, each has been taken in isolation without noting that both sides of the Autonomic Nervous System are conjoined. Instead of a perspective that sees the whole person and the simple holistic effect of marijuana, a myopic and reductionistic method of measurement has been employed, and marijuana’s profound meaning for health has been lost. (p. 31)<br>            Marijuana, by its effect on the ANS, enhances both sides of the brain. Through increased Sympathetic action, left brain perception is heightened, while, at the same time, right brain reception is enhanced. This is a physiological fact. More blood, and cleaner blood, is sent to the brain, as in the “fight or flight” reaction. And because of Parasympathetic dilation of capillaries, which signifies relaxation, the blood supply to the entire brain is increased. More blood means more oxygen and consequently clearer and broader thinking. Since marijuana works on both sides of the brain, the most noticeable effect, in our fast-paced mind set, is one of slowing down, which blends the thrusting competitive attitude with the contrasting viewpoint of nurturance to arrive at a more cooperative balance. This experience is, however, not innate to marijuana, but to the mental set of the subject. When we are mellow, tired, and relaxed, marijuana is energizing and affords alertness, determination, and even strength. This variation in the physiological effects has caused great confusion from an either/or framework. And the balancing nature of marijuana (both/and) has not been understood. It both stimulates and relaxes, simultaneously, which equates to an unpredictable variation in effect that is solely dependent on the state of its subject. When the system is sluggish, as with natives in warm climates (Africa, India, South America), marijuana has been used extensively and for centuries to energize it:<br>  A common practice among laborers... have a puff of a ganja (marijuana) pipe to produce well-being, relieve fatigue, stimulate appetite. (Chopra and Chopra, 1939, p.3)<br>  When the system is hyper-aroused, as in today’s lifestyle, marijuana calms. The significance of this fact cannot be ignored. It explains the increased creativity reported as a part of the marijuana experience, because when both sides of brain processes are heightened, both types of brain activity are greater. The left brain notices more, while the right brain receives more. This is the unification of logic and intuition. The term “expansion of consciousness” is explained physiologically as a “shifting of brain emphasis from one-sidedness to balance” (Sugarmena and Tarter, 1978), which fits precisely with the feeling called “high.” (p. 35)<br>            Marijuana ingestion has been shown to change the worried state by producing alpha waves, experienced as well being. (p. 36)<br>            When we ingest marijuana, the heart swells through capillary enhancement and is fueled more by more fully oxygenated blood, while, at the same time, its contractions and expansions are greater, allowing for stronger pumping action to the rest of the body (p. 37)<br>            As rigidity in the body is released or reduced by the action of marijuana, there is a corresponding reduction of mental tension that translates into a feeling of expansion and well being and explains the reverential attitude commonly expressed by marijuana lovers. (p. 39)<br>            As the body’s workings can become more harmonious with marijuana, the functioning of the five senses can be noticeably improved ....In our discussion, the trigger to the high experience is marijuana, but many other activities can also produce it, such as jogging, chanting, fasting, isolation, meditation, and prayer. (p. 41)<br>            The marijuana experience itself does not miraculously cure. Instead, it allows the body a respite from the tensions of imbalance, while exposing the mental confusion of the mind. The marijuana experience of balance becomes a learned and, over time, somewhat permanent response as the essential human tendency to homeostasis is reawakened and the natural healing process restored. (p. 49)|`|Ywu6quqZaa	It is good for digestion, as well as for curing common stomach sicknesses. It is good for healing asthma (oddly), is good to combat anorexia and fights nausea and vomiting. It is a good painkiller and is used for treatment of movement disorders.<br>  <br>  And, no it dose not cause permanent retardation. It dosent even kill brain cells, it only stuns them.<br>  <br>  It's also a good alternative to drinking because it wares off faster and alcohol CAN kill brain cells.|`|F9e0lY50aa	I dont know about everyone else's benefits, but it helps me fall asleep at night.

As long as you don't put weed first, and make sure you can supoport yourself and not screw up in anyway (including getting caught with weed), marijuana serves the purpose it was intended to.  Yes some people get screwed up, leave school and hurt family ect. But those are the kids and the people who arent smart enough. But Anyone can fix what they caused by smoking weed.

ufgv7oTjaa	Hmm... that's a tough one. B-12 does have a smell and a taste to it, although it's a small dose, so it's not so bad. If she can't get it out of food at all and you can't convince her to swallow a pill (even by saying it's something else or hiding the pill in food), then you might be forced to just open a capsule of B-12 and mix it into some food. I wouldn't do a liquid unless it's a smoothie, but anything mushy would be the easiest (pudding, yogurt, apple sauce, etc, etc). I would avoid putting it in hot foods or anything that will be baked or microwaved to maintain the maximum benefits and potency of it. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|yE2vM76naa	- - I suggest you speak to her doctor. <br>  When pernicious anemia induces mood swings along those lines, you have a situation on your hands where she should be getting injections until she is stable. THEN  worry about getting it in her mouth.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	You can buy a special kind of B12 designed for sublingual use. These pills are much smaller than normal B12 capsules, so should be a lot easier to hide in food/drinks after crushing.<br>  Another option is a supplement called "Shot of b12" sold at Wal Mart it's a liquid with a fruity taste, being a liquid should make it easier to hide in orange juice, etc.|`|AA11828439	That would be ILLEGAL!|`|PpWosZsIaa	Hide it in jelly or pudding|`|LMoJl7hFaa	B12 is a food supplement, empty the capsule and put it in her food.  Its just more nutrients.<br>  <br>  Was she on a drug and then got off of it too quickly.   That can give her a deficiencey.  Or she might have an unbalance of the Bs if you give her too much of the B12.  <br>  <br>  And often when a person is older, they can't change the B12 from cynocobalimine to menthylcobalamine.  I do know a brand of B supplements that has the B12 already in the mnthylcobalamine form.<br>  Find it here www.realfoodnutrients.com/neu/home.htm.  Its made for neuropathy but works well as a B supplement for someone who needs them. <br>  <br>  If you mom was getting enough of the right supplement and getting results she probably wouldn't not take it.|`|dHg78Phdaa	Talk to her doctor, he could probably tell her or sell you B12 but stronger or something.

AA12221820	ITS POBS. BCUZ UR NOT SUPPOST 2 HAVE SEX 4 THOSE 7 DAYS SO THEY MUST OF MESSED UP UR SYSTEM OR SOMETHING|`|HeBFxZVCaa	if your doc says its not chlamydia or a yeast infection get him/her to cheak if you have thrush as it has some of the same symptoms.|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	If you are diagnosed with chlamydia, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics, which should clear up the infection in 7 to 10 days. Anyone with whom you've had sex will also need to be tested and treated for chlamydia because that person may be infected but not have any symptoms. This includes any sexual partners in the last 2 months or your last sexual partner if it has been more than 2 months since your last sexual experience. It is very important that someone with a chlamydia infection abstain from having sex until they and their partner have been treated.<br>  <br>  If a sexual partner has chlamydia, quick treatment will reduce his or her risk of complications and will lower your chances of being reinfected if you have sex with that partner again. (You can become infected with chlamydia again even after you have been treated because having chlamydia does not make you immune to it.)<br>  <br>  It's better to prevent chlamydia than to treat it, and the only way to completely prevent the infection is to abstain from all types of sexual intercourse. If you do have sex, use a latex condom every time. This is the only birth control method that will help prevent chlamydia.<br>  <br>  If you have had the same partner then i would have a very long talk with them...
RgEtKVaKaa	The vagina is not easily visible.  Often women mistake their vagina for their urethra - the opening where urine (pee) leaves the body.  If you either look or feel (or both) you will find the clitoris which is the first thing you touch as you start your way to your vagina.  The clitoris is a somewhat hard, raised area.  If you were a male, this would have grown into a penis.  Next is your urethra - where your pee comes out.  It is not at all easy to see as it is not raised & does not appear to be an actual opening.  As a nurse, I have inserted a tube into many urethra's on my way to a person's bladder (the sack that collects your urine). The textbooks describe the urethra as rosebud appearing - not always & definetely not when you are using a mirror to find your parts.   Sometimes I have a difficult time visualizing the urethra & I have a far better vantage point than you will have.  The urethra lies between your clitoris & your vagina & leads directly to your bladder.  Next is the vagina.  From the outside, it does not look like an actual hole.  The vagina is very muscular - that is why tampons do not fall out. It takes a while to learn to use tampons.  Read the instructions in the box if you feel you need to use tampons - they are very helpful. If you don't insert the tampon far enough into the vagina, you will feel discomfort - just pull it out & start over. You will find your vagina. Just relax - this happens to all of us. Beyond your vagina is your anus - where your poop comes out.  Everything is usually in a straight line.  You will NOT see you vagina with a mirror - they labia (lips) cover the opening.   It is not a big hole - just a slit - if you spread the labia.  <br>  It is good to here that you are a virgin.  That is very cool.  Are you worried that your parts are not where they should or that they are not there at all?|`|vGxipYJnaa	There's no need to be embarrassed in front of your mom. A cribriform hymen isn't all that rare - and it's usually very easy to fix. Sometimes it actually resolves itself on its own. Since you're only 14, it may become more elastic and "normal" as you age. If you'd like it fixed sooner so that you can use tampons, then just see your doctor who can refer you to someone who can help.<br>  <br>  Planned parenthood could help if you really don't want to involve your mom - but they won't be able to fix it for you. It's nothing to be embarrassed about at all though.|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	that sounds kind of different, you're right.<br>  are you sure you can't get a tampon in there?<br>  if you're inserting it right, and it doesn't fit, then yeah, you should see a doctor about that. <br>  i hate to make you sound like an idiot, but are you sure you're looking at the right holes?<br>  try using a mirror.<br>  good luck.|`|qiYjhM4Gaa	after you have sex for the first time, have you ever heard of "popping your cherry"? it's also called "bustin your hymen" lol. alot of girls (most) will bleed from the first time they have intercourse. don't worry, i think you're fine. after you have sex for the first time, maybe two, it'll be different :)|`|Px8urrAuaa	There is 2 holes...That should be all that you see.<br>  Urethra- which you pee out of.<br>  Vaginal- menstrual blood.<br>  If you're worried about it, you can go to planned Parenthood, but honestly you should tell your Mom what's going on.

You're probably a little different down there than most, but nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your mom and let her know that you're a little worried about what's going on there. It's not something you should be embarrassed or ashamed about. Its a normal question. Consider yourself smart enough to notice it and brave enough to ask questions and seek answers. You can ask people all over the web honey.  My advice is the best answer is to talk to mom and go see a gynecologist. Even if you go to planned parenthood, they can examine you, let you know what's going on, and if it's something that needs to be fixed, they will refer to someone who can help. That simple. Nothing to be stressed about.<br>  <br>  P.S. It is cool you are still a virgin. It's the best thing in the world. I am not here to preach to you, but to give you a piece of advice. Hold on to your virginity as long as you can. Until you are old enough to decide who you want to gift it to. Hopefully your husband. :-) I made the mistake of giving my precious gift away too early. When I was 16.  Just remember once it's gone, it's gone and you can never get it back. So please make it special and with someone you love, and that loves you as well. It's so rare to see girls your age still a virgin. I am proud of you. Keep up the good work!|`|Qi0bSqCjaa	i think your vag is fucked up might want to see a doctor! as soon as possible. hope i helped! ps the tampon will not fit up your pee hole but if it does that would be ******* funny and hurt like a *****. p.s.s people who take picks of there vag are sluts dont do that!|`|TiRxOAKvaa	girl i;m 17 and have the same prob.i just means you got the good good but u need to be aware that we young ladies hve 3 holes in all.as far as the tampons......i cant use them either.hope i helped.|`|NdhFM3l0aa	consult your GP.

Electric and magnetic fields are part of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation which extends from static electric and magnetic fields, through radiofrequency and infrared radiation, to X-rays.<br>  <br>  Electromagnetic fields of all frequencies represent one of the most common and fastest growing environmental influences, about which anxiety and speculation are spreading. All populations are now exposed to varying degrees of EMF, and the levels will continue to increase as technology advances.<br>  <br>  As part of its Charter to protect public health and in response to public concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the International EMF Project in 1996 to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the frequency range from 0 to 300 GHz.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The EMF Project is open to broad participation<br>  <br>  The EMF Project is open to any WHO Member State government, i.e. department of health, or representatives of other national institutions concerned with radiation protection.

Electric and magnetic fields also arise from the motors and heating coils found in electronic equipment and appliances.<br>  <br>  Because the use of electric power is so widespread, humans are constantly exposed to electric and magnetic fields. Studies conducted in the 1980s showed a link between magnetic field strength and the risk of childhood leukemia. After reviewing more than two decades of research in this area, NIEHS scientists have concluded that the overall pattern of results suggests a weak association between increasing exposure to EMFs and an increased risk of childhood leukemia. The few studies that have been conducted on adult exposures show no evidence of a link between residential EMF exposure and adult cancers, including leukemia, brain cancer, and breast cancer. Based on these reviews, the NIEHS recommends continued education on practical ways of reducing exposures to EMFs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.greenlivingonline.com/article/dangers-emfs-and-your-cell-phone" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenlivingonline.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  "Limit cell phone use because of the possible risk of cancer," warned Ronald B.

The debate has brought to the public by a report published by an international group of experts in August 2007. <br>  <br>  The BioInitiative Working Group includes twenty scientists, researchers and public health policy professionals who reviewed more than 2,000 scientific papers and reviews on EMFs.

After he did that, his sister comited suicide because she was so sad that her brother did that. After that the two parents did the same. So no, its not for the better for anyone, not even you.

The fact that it is bad for you factors into this question because the effect it has on your body is what will throw of your period.<br>  <br>  One time, I took 4 bc pills because I had missed some. I was an absolute mess for about a week...super emotional, extreme cramps, headaches and moodswings. I didn't get my period for 2 months after that.<br>  <br>  My guess is that you are attempting to use the BC pill as an abortion aid. If this is not the case, I don't mean to offend you, but this is the first thing that comes to mind for how many pills you are taking. I say that because if you actually missed or forgot to take 8 pills, you would have already gotten your period. If you are using this in an abortion manner, know that it will not actually kill the fetus, just cause harm to it [and you]. Best to go to the doctor, and have a real abortion performed [or take RU-84 if you're less than 2 months].

We have them run 1 pole for every ten pitches they throw.  This helps to reduce the lactic acid buildup and flush the rotator cuff.

Train yourself to push all of the stressful thoughts out of your mind, as you lie in bed. It takes time but you can do it. (it worked for me)  You won't solve anything with excessive thinking, so lie down, & try relaxing your body, starting at your feet & working all the way to your head. It may take time to work but it will. If you have stress in your life, then try ways to eliminate that stress by talking to your parents or a trusted adult you feel comfy with.

AA11427075	Obviously Jodieee has not had any experience with your problem so I'm not sure why she would bother answering.  Why soldier through something if you don't have to?  All that stuff affects your quality of life.  Prescriptions meds even if you did have insurance cause horrible side effects (I have tried Paxil and Cymbalta for anxiety and depression and both were mind altering and made me totally sick even after the 1 pill I took... plus there are awful withdrawal symptoms and you can't get off them very easy).  Everything I have read about 5-HTP is good so far.  I just started 2 days ago.  My symptoms are relatively mild too but the insomnia is horrible and the anxiety / fatigue / depression is not fun.  Why not give it a try?  I have not read anything that says you can become dependant on it.  My side effects are hardly anything so far except a bit of fatigue which is helpful at night when I can't sleep!  If your sadness & nervousness are a result of low serotonin levels in your brain (chemicals that make you happy) it should help.  It prob. won't help the fatigue though.  Start off with 50mg a day and increase it to what helps... not more than 300mg.  I started taking just 1 50mg tablet before bed but think I will increase it to 100mg before bed and 50mg in the morning.|`|9IqzLDhnaa	i wouldn't take anything if i was you, you can become depend-ant on them, and may end up having to take them for the rest of yourlife. surely if the symptoms are very mild you can soldier through.

N3t7uv1saa	cardiac output decreases with atrial tachycardia because there is not enough time between beats to fill the ventricles.  It isn't a very pleasant feeling to have this so the best thing would be to see a cardiologist.  there are good drugs now that can control the atrial rate.  If it is regular and about 150 it can be very tiring and cause shortness of breath.  If it goes too fast you certainly can loose consciousness due to lack of blood flow to the brain etc.  Have it check and treated.

AA11091145	It was probably the amoxillin you were allergic to.  <br>  <br>  Taking any narcotic like vicodin releases histamine in the body making any allergic reaction worse.|`|LsAArkUyaa	It is more likely that you reacted to the amoxicillin. There really wasn't' enough time for the vicodin to get into your system. Also antibiotic allergies are much more common.

WpA7n8Iwaa	I've had at least 5 surgeries and there's really not much to them.  <br>  <br>  They give you something to relax before they take you to the room where the operation will be done, and that really helps.  It makes you feel very mellow.  Then, even if you think that you're wide awake, the anesthesia just knocks you right out.  It's not a gradual process at all.  It's like one minute you're looking up at a light, and the next you're waking up from surgery.  <br>  <br>  Nothing to worry about at all.  I hope it goes well for you!|`|HX2hkNj4aa	Actually you have a higher chance of waking up during an operation than you do not waking up. look up "Anesthesia awareness" hope that helps...
pWl7SHjTaa	seriously, It sounds like the grand old flu.

It sucks being sick, hope you get better.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Beri Beri
oRPvkExwaa	This is a terrible diet. Crash diets might seem to work temporarily but they're horrible for your body, and you will gain the lost weight back immediately after ending your diet. You need to eat real meals, with lots of fruits and vegetables and low in fat. Also, it's important to eat a good breakfast every morning to keep your metabolism up.|`|84vvo1EYaa	i have no idea who would even think to create that diet, but it definately does not seem like a healthy one to begin with. eating all the same thing all the time will get boring anyway. you need all different types of foods to get the vitamins that your body needs. just try to eat healthy and you will be fine. don't do something that is unhealthy for your body.|`|5oy46Dwuaa	noodles are high in sodium these will make you look bigger the complete opopsite of what you want, sodium dries out water giving you the bloat look|`|jYRz7i7Xaa	i think that having a low calorie diet is fine, but its should be from a variety of foods. If you have your heart set on instant noodles that's fine, but maybe  you could try to add some cooked or steamed vegetable to it to make it a little healthier. Another good tip for cutting back calories is not limiting your self to barley any calories a day, just cut back 500 a day based on a normal diet. So maybe limit yourself to 1500 or something around there, that way after a week you would have lost 3500 calories which is how many calories that are in a pound. <br>  *TIP* celery is one of the best foods you can snack on because it takes more calories to chew and digest then what are actually in it.<br>  <br>  Hope i could be of some help, just make sure not to starve yourself and loose weight in an unhealthy way. It is better to loose weight slow and healthily than fast and unhealthily. <br>  <br>  Good Luck Girl <3|`|Kfn2XlZAaa	nooooo no way, people always think that eating less helps lose weight but the best thing to do is eat correctly the correct amount of fruit and veg and fibre and protien carbohydrates to keep a healthy balance aparently not eating enough can make you GAIN weight
G6V4oRjKaa	Vaporisers work by building up heat, just enough to evaporate the THC crystals. Because THC evaporates at a very low temperature something like 200 C or 400 F the THC vapour can be inhaled quite easily from the bag without any adverse effects. The THC will get transported to the lungs and any residue will simply be absorbed by the organ tissue just like water. If you smoke it cannabis burns at about 2000 C that's a hell of a lot hotter than tobacco and smoking is probably the worst ingestion method of anything. that will burn you and all the toxic and poisonous carcinogenous residues wouldn't be good for your lungs either|`|fZgoUty4aa	the only thing worth using for cannabis is ..THE DUST BIN.......|`|OHfcGAgIaa	yea they're 100% healthier, and don't harm your health. Take a look at the volcano (probably the best), it's a bit pricey though.<br>  <br>  Alex K - WTF are you talking about? Do some research before answering with a load of crap mate.|`|fxDQqDjzaa	Health wise they are better for you then smoking. I like the effects from smoking better though.<br>  <br>  And to Father Jake do you care to share a source that says pot causes mental problems? That is completely false. If someone already has mental problems then pot could exacerbate them, but it certainly does not cause them.|`|2ncaaoFPaa	Nope, vaporizers ionize THC and bind it to the scale in the water. They turn pot into incense that can no longer get you high.|`|ZXdAimqXaa	I disagree, and I think they aren't very good|`|4bQVu38Yaa	I've got a Da Buddha vaporiser. Its great, of all the paraphernalia I own (way too much, haha) its my favourite. I could swear I feel healthier now I vape more than I smoke.<br>  <br>  Here's a copy of the review I wrote of it:<br>  <br>  So, my impressions. Firstly, the idea that a vape saves on weed is nonsense. I've been getting through weed faster than ever, but that's probably due to the fact that I want to use my vape constantly, just don't get sick of it.<br>  <br>  At first I didn't expect too much from it, my only other experience of a vape was a nasty metal heating plate one that just burned the weed and was incredibly harsh. This one is great though. I've never had a huge love of the taste of weed until I vaped some, it tastes great. No "smokey" flavour, just cannabisaliciousness. No nasty adulterants in the mixture, all the bits that get hot are glass and ceramic, so no flavours added from that at all. No harshness at all, seriously, you can't even tell at all that you're inhaling anything other than air. If anything the air feels cold!<br>  <br>  It's very versatile too. You can use it like smoking a joint, wee little puffs over a longer period, or with the bong adapter, you can (once you find the perfect temperature) fill a bong with vapour and replicate the "head mangling" effect of a bong hit, hits you like a beautiful, sticky, icky train.<br>  <br>  Basically, it's just as satisfying as smoking but healthier. Can't argue with that.<br>  <br>  It does work with legals too, but not as well as with weed, legals are much better smoked in my view. (Though I have only tried Yucatan in it, others might work better)<br>  <br>  I super-duper-recommend investing in one of these bad boys, you can get them from here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dabuddhavaporizer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dabuddhavaporizer.com/</a><br>  <br>  It might well be worth asking them to lie a bit when it comes to the value of it for customs reasons, if it's under ￡120 then you don't have to pay nearly as much, so ask if they can do that for you.<br>  <br>  Another thing to note (UK peeps only) is that it comes with a 2 prong plug, so you'll either have to find an adaptor, or a MUCH better idea, wire a 13A UK plug on.|`|06a1831b0b8ffd82f1a1af8d01d8f301aa	If your smoking it to enjoy 'A Smoke' then stick with joints.<br>  If you have a problem smoking then its a smoke free way of getting high but it still hits your chest and gets you NAILED!|`|AA12308931	Yes, get a vap! It works better I think, and tastes just great!
VWNiOxcvaa	Yeah artificial corrections(glasses, contacts, surgery) are a disgrace. We are so much better than that. They diminish real vision, they disfigure our face directly and in the way they make us appear to be stressed out. They also make people jut their heads forward and throw posture all out of whack. They bottleneck brain speed and memory. They reduce hearing and smell. They tighten our necks and shoulders locking our heads in place. People with artificial corrections are become more introverted and clumsy. Most people who get macular degeneration and retinal detachment are mostly people who have been wearing strong artificial corrections for many years.<br>  <br>  Most people can return to natural perfect eyesight by unlearning the incorrect vision habits, reintegrating the correct vision behaviors, and undoing the damage of artificial corrections and blur.<br>  <br>  Avoid anything that talks about eye exercises(eye pushups, eye aerobics, eye yoga) or eye potions, they have nothing to do with natural perfect eyesight and are a waste of time. Nutrition is important but does not change vision behavior.<br>  <br>  In order to effectively return to Natural Perfect Eyesight we must read the best books and get the guidance of a teacher who teaches face to face. I have a referral link to one of the best books on my website. I can interview a teacher you may be interested in to make sure that they are teaching correct principles and not eye exercises or potions.|`|FJpPCVTCaa	reduce your life stresses, as stress will bend your eye lenses out of shape disabling your vision. exercise and eat more vegetables. beetroot and cucumbers help you focus your vision better as they lower your blood pressure. also do eye exercises, and don't strain your vision when looking at things at the distance, just calm down as you focus on objects in the distance. also i find going on nature walks without glasses helps too.<br>  also avoid MSG and other excito-toxin food additives that destroy your vision. even food coloring as there is no information on how it impacts the health of your eyesight. it's quite possible to regain 20/20 vision within 3 weeks.|`|yNGWA678aa	What a disgrace.
PImvmP1paa	Your blood platelets aren't going to the wound fast enough to help form a clot which helps stop the bleeding. <br>  <br>  Your platelet count may be down, or you can be borderline hemophiliac. <br>  <br>  Get it checked out.|`|3hkArqvbaa	Hemophilia? Maybe you have a less severe form.|`|GcnujfHhaa	Maybe you just have alot of blood and you probably have been pricked in the veins|`|WqkOI7RDaa	I think it's called hemophilia, but I'm not sure. Do any relatives have this problem?<br>  You might have a clotting disorder that is causing your blood to not make scabs or clots. I'd see a doctor about it. If you were to get in a car accident or something, you could easily bleed to death. I think there are meds that can fix it.
4pw7zlRHaa	Depends on what insurance you have, but normally insurances cover any therapy up to a point. I have Capital Blue Cross and I pay 45 dollars every week to see my therapist and I've been diagnosed. I've a few insurances, but sometimes the place will find you help, as in maybe get you on medicare to cover the rest of the cost. They can also put you on payment plans. So, it really depends on the insurance your talking about. Plus, you could call the number on the back of the card and ask how much they cover and how much you pay. I made that mistake once of not calling thinking that my insurance covered it all.|`|m5h7jcphaa	healthplans.bebto.com - here is my health insurance plan. As I remember they can provide such a service.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	You should read your policy for some guidance.  I am sure most plans do not provide for extended therapy.   Frankly, my eyes glass over when I attempt read my policy for any problem.   I think I would go forward with one session and wait for approval or rejection.  With that ruling letter the insurer's third party administrator will tell you about the scope of your coverage like they have never told you before now!!   What was not clear and conspicuous will become "headline news" as to the portion that is not covered.  Try not to become angry because the medical community has plucked the insured patients bare.  I see the background problem of the docs trying to maximize the bounty under your policy.   So,  try one visit and do not reschedule until a third party administrator rules on the treatment plan from your mental health provider.
HD29O7Ataa	I don't think so, but I'm no doctor, and can't say for sure.<br>  <br>  I work out myself, and depending on what you do, your muscles can be strained (not literally) in the neck area depending on what you're doing. I know what you're talking about, but have never felt pain like you're describing.<br>  <br>  If you've got some of these symptoms, I'd recommend you'd make an appointment with a doc so you can get the real drugs :P<br>  -Headaches that are localized or following a "ram's horn" pattern on the side of the head, often starting in the upper neck or base of the skull. It can be one-sided or on both sides.<br>  -Scalp that is tender to the touch, even brushing your hair can be a painful experience.<br>  - Pain or pressure behind the eyes. Eyes are very sensitive to light especially when the headache is present.<br>  <br>  If you've got insurance, I'd recommend starting off with your family doctor, then if you've still got problems, he/she will probably steer you in the right direction.

You'll get them in time anyway...this is about the time you'll start to hit puberty.

You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|7W9W4G7saa	Oh my god!!

RgEtKVaKaa	I am a psychiatric nurse.  Do not increase your dose of Clonazepam without taking to your MD.  The dosage is NOT the same.  Maintain close contact with your MD during this change - call if you have questions.  How much Clonazepam were you prescribed - just 0.5 mg each morning?  Did the Xanex stop working?  Why did your MD change your medication? Have you considered short term counseling/therapy to help you with your anxiety? If your anxiety continues without relief AND you are not seeing a psychiatrist, I strongly encourage you to do so.|`|3dccLgsyaa	I'm not sure what you should do, but both drugs are very addicting.  I found clonazepam (Klonopin) to be extremely hard to taper off of.  The 2 drugs are also closely related.  Klonopin stays in your system longer.
dpgXzMenaa	Having vaginal sex alone isn't a very effective way to have orgasms for most women, because the vagina isn't the place where women's most direct sexual pleasure comes from.   The clitoris is.<br>  <br>  It might interest you to know that by the age of 12, 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that by age 15, it's 2/3 of them doing it *regularly* (many of them more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse.<br>  <br>  ... or that the very first thing sex therapists teach women who've never had an orgasm is how to masturbate - because that's the *only* sure fire way for a woman to learn how her body responds sexually and what will bring her to orgasm.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.    You already know that... so why not start there?<br>  <br>  If you can have orgasms dependably when you masturbate, you can have them dependably whenever you have sex with a partner... either by giving them to yourself during sex or by teaching your partner what works for you so *he* can give them to you.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	I didn't have orgasms with a man until I met one that didn't feel he was doing his job unless I had one (I had already been sexually active for 5 years when I met him - never an orgasm with others, just by myself.) So, needless to say, we ended up doing what I do to get myself off (clitoral stimulation & rhythmic penetration) and since then, I have not had a problem having an orgasm with any person I want to. Take charge of your sexuality and you will find it much more gratifying.|`|Lu8XFfNUaa	I'm in the same boat, because my boyfriend never wants to do anything to me that would make it better for me.

YnGwPBR4aa	Depending on your age you may be sick or you are suffering sleep deprivation. <br>  Teens need at least 9 hours of sleep every night<br>  Adults need at least 8 <br>  So if you haven't been getting this amount on a pretty regular basis it may be the problem.<br>  <br>  (Addition to answer) I also don't always get enough sleep and sometimes around 7:00 my cheeks will start to become red and warm.

It's important that you take days off from it and that do you not exceed the dosage.  Otherwise, you can build up a resistance to it and it won't work anymore (or else you could go in the other direction and become dependent on it).

CnSaGHqWaa	Somewhere along the way I had a partner who, while performing on me simply grabbed my hand (that would be my right hand) and placed it around my penis and started moving it up and down. Before you could say jumping jack flash I was doing myself in front of her. When I would start to pull off (no pun intended) she would gently put my hand back. At some point I totally got into it full on. She was definitely turned on and I was going bonkers doing myself while she was watching, what a turn on!! I would find it hard to believe that a man would not understand what was going on in this situation. Give it a try and see what comes of it:) There wasn't a word spoken and we continued this type of love when ever the feeling struck.

Sometimes I think about quitting when I am overly lazy for long periods of time. Then I realize it's me who is lazy, not the weed. Then I get up and do something. <br>  <br>  I used to be a distance runner back in my high school and college days. I smoked periodically then, but not enough to ever hurt me (this is back when I thought marijuana COULD actually hurt me). I have been picking it back up again, and weird as it may seem, I consistently run faster/more comfortably when I am high.

Pwybznsxaa	Yeah, this sounds like constipation! I have the hardest time voiding, too! Matter of fact all of the time. I used to take laxatives every now and then and they wouldn't work-so i then started taking double doses and it worked. But lately i haven't taken any and I started drinking these All-Bran Fiber drink mix singles. They're made by Kellogg's and you can get pink lemonde or tea and just mix in a bottle of water. They taste so good and i have been going regularly now. They taste like regular lemonde, for real! Constipation is no fun and after 2 or 3 days of not going-something has to be done.<br>  <br>  You're probably dehydrated from not eating/drinking and your bowels are a little stiff. Not saying you have an overall problem with constipation, but try that drink mix and see if it helps.|`|M3pRAe7Vaa	Since you are getting over a sickness, you need to give your body time to get back on its normal track.  First of all, your decreased appetite and diarrhea didn't provide any "bulk" for a bowel movement to even occur. Also, you mentioned that you had diarrhea when you were sick...did you happen to take any anti-diarrhea medication?  While stopping your immediate diarrhea, this can cause constipation for a few days afterward.  Also, you mentioned you ate a banana sandwich.  Bananas are known for causing constipation.   Also, an important factor is that when you were sick, you had a decreased appetite, therefore, were not eating the foods you normally would have to cause a bowel movement.  This is probably the main thing causing the delay in having a BM.<br>  <br>  You don't need to see a doctor at this point. Your normal track is off due to being sick, and you just need to give yourself time to get back on track.  Drink lots of water and eat high fiber foods, and also dried fruits, included dried plums.  These work wonders for bowel movements.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|qlO6UZZyaa	Your symptoms sound like your stomach is irritated and inflamed from some cause. When you are having any stomach effects like the ones you report Holistic Practitioners may opine that it indicates you are not digesting the foods you are eating. Simplifying your diet and eating only soft, simple foods like cream of wheat, and prepared baby foods may be of benefit. If you choose to do this for a few days, you should see an improvement in symptoms. Liquids ingested with your food may dilute your stomach acid and digestive enzymes. Avoid drinking excessively hot or cold beverages at this time. <br>  Ginger and natural lemon are good remedies for nausea. The gentlest way to use them is with room temperature Ginger Ale poured over ice, and/or naturally flavored Lemon Drop hard candy.|`|jU6hOadFaa	I would continue eating as many high-fibre foods as you can and drinking LOTS of water over the next couple of days.

KAwYumFfaa	Thank gudness u dont have strep throat, that is serious! Can lead to alot of disease, that strep bacteria..Sigh. I too suffer on a regular basis of tonsilitis, i medicate and sometimes i just let my body cope with the disease. I haven't been to surgery, tonsillectomy, though I've met someone who have been to surgery and she told me she haven't got any problem regarding her throat ever since! She's 40+ now and she had the tonsillectomy when she was yet 18. No need to worry with the surgery, cause success rate is high with that surgery and it is quite common procedure. <br>  One more thing, you can have the surgery after the tonsilitis. The doctor, i think, will not operate if the tonsils are inflamed. :)

pvYy6iTSaa	smiley - My guess is you are referring to smallpox vaccine and disease ONLY.  Smallpox virus is today known to be found in only 2 places in the world = a lab in Atlanta, Georgia, and a lab in Moscow, where it is tremendously safeguarded to prevent its use as one of the most deadly diseases and germ-warfare weapons.  The so-called smallpox vaccine is NOT made from the smallpox virus but rather from a related cowpox virus, and always has.  Giving the vaccine reportedly will result in about one death in every million vaccinations.  Though there has not been a single person known to have smallpox on earth in the past 30+ years, today some military forces and research medical lab workers do receive the vaccine for protection.  The vaccine has done a magnificent job in saving lives all over the earth.
Qkodga1Uaa	Hun, hugs for relizing your problem!<br>  I have Self Harmed many times and it is not easy to stop. One way I brought it up to my homebound teacher last year was a text to her and another time I had pulled my sleeve up to where she could see the cuts, and she brought it up. But I didnt pull the sleeve up right in front of her and I didnt try to hide my arm too much, but it is so much easier on you when someone you trust knows. Depending on where and how you do it it might be a possiblility, even if it sounds somewhat dumb.<br>  Or you could write a letter to her and just explain your feelings and everything you want to tell her.<br>  I am here for you if you need support! Just email me anytime: spasticmaniac@yahoo.com<br>  Please bring it up, I know it takes a lot of courage, but you can do it! hugs!<br>  xoxo|`|e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	I am glad you want to stop.  <br>  <br>  I know how scary it is to open up and tell anyone about it.  Its a big step, but necessary if you want to stop.<br>  <br>  I suggest you print out a few pages from the internet about self-harm.  Give the pages to your pastor when you have a private moment  and ask her to read all of it.  Tell her you want to talk to her in private.  Ask her if she'd call you to arrange an appointment after she reads the information you gave her.  The information you give her will break the ice.  It will also inform her about self-abuse.  <br>  <br>  There is quite alot on the internet about this.  I strongly suggest you read about it and see if you can find any coping tools that would work for you when you feel the need to self-harm.  <br>  <br>  I used to hurt myself.  I got help.  I had to identify why I was doing it and I had to learn coping tools I could use when the urges came. <br>  <br>  You are not alone.  You are a good person and you don't have to hurt yourself to get through the tough stuff in life.  There are good alternatives.  Find them and use them.

It won't make you big and bulky. <br>  <br>  you DON'T need to go on cardio machines for an hour each day. How boring and what a waste of time.<br>  <br>  Your BEST bet is interval training - alternating between high and low intensity on your cardio machines for 15- 20 mins max.<br>  <br>  Do a short set of weights followed by your interval cardio on your gym days. Your workout should be 45 mins max.<br>  <br>  If you want to know what exercises work best, you can download my free Little Black Book of Fat Loss Secrets report here <br>  <a href="http://www.danielmunday.com/fat-loss-secrets/" rel="nofollow">http://www.danielmunday.com/fat-loss-sec...</a><br>  <br>  good luck,<br>  Daniel<br>  <a href="http://www.danielmunday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.danielmunday.com</a>|`|qFTZ6ypyaa	sounds like all that is okay, but lifting weights is actually an amazing secret people don't focus on as much as they should ESPECIALLY women. by lifting weights your body actually burns more calories <br>   1. muscle requires more energy than fat and therefore burns fat even long after a work out <br>   2. women won't get bulky muscle, so no need to worry there unless you decide you want to drink 2 high calorie protein shakes a day, but i don't think that's your plan. you lose fat and get a little more tone and tighter<br>  <br>  so keep up the work, add some weights and you'll be lookin great!

nKuf2yl1aa	Panoxyl Foaming wash is excellent... keep using it, it's what my dermatologist recommended to me & I really like it. It's going to take around 1-3 weeks to start noticing any major difference. The key is to stick with it.. You may also want to try Panoxyl aquagel 2.5%... for spot treatment, I like that too.<br>  <br>  If topical treatments don't seem to work for you, you may want to consider internal medicine. Alot of girls with acne I know have had really good results from going on birth control for their skin. If you're comfortable with this option, it's one you should consider. Talk to your doctor about what brand of pills is right for you and your severity of acne. <br>  <br>  GL though... :)|`|w7XNcmihaa	I had this and I don't really think it works at all ! I use Clean and Clear, and it works well for me ! You should get a product with Benzoyl Peroxide in it (it says it on the front of the bottle if there's it inside). This really helps acne ! You can also go to <a href="http://www.skinid.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinid.com</a> and take the test and use the products, they are also very helpful !<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't let your looks get you down ! :)
tcGZFpUoaa	First of all, don't panic yet. Many women experience something like this in their life; I once had mine for a month! It's could be a hormonal reaction.<br>  <br>  Next, I'd call your OB/GYN and just ask her about it or even schedule an appointment. Don't be embarrassed, you have nothing to be ashamed of. (If you are dizzy or feeling nauseated, please see your doctor immediately).<br>  <br>  Thirdly, think about anything that's changed in the past month. Have you been more stressed out? Have you been working out more? Have you had surgery? A hormonal reaction could just be causing your period to last longer. Especially if it's lighter. The lighter it is, the longer it lasts. <br>  <br>  But call your OB/GYN and just ask.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Gosh! I sure hope you don't have fibroids.

I think it felt weird when you tried again because it used to be a habit and if you want to get back into a bad habit sometimes the mood doesn't feel right anymore because you've grown from quitting.<br>  <br>  Remember that you make the choices. You don't need to punish yourself, because the things that are upsetting you are doing that. Tell the doctor about your suicidal thoughts - they are really helpful and don't force you to do anything you don't want to (such as counselling) and it's all confidential so if you don't want to tell anyone you don't have to.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope things get better for you soon!|`|ds5MCdS5aa	First off, I would try just sitting down with your Mum, and talking really serious to her.  Show her where you are cutting yourself, and tell her it is a bigger problem then just "moodieness".  If you cant talk to your mum, maybe you could go to the school counsler and tell him/her your situation.  Then you AND the counsler could sit down with your Mum so that she would understand how serious this is.  Please don't let it go sweetheart!  Good Luck!|`|iF9tJy3Laa	Having a strong faith in god has always been great medicines, and that saves you the part from talking about it to someone who you dont feel comfortable around such as a counselor.

The Bible will make it possible for you to understand--and in time overcome--these problems.<br>  <br>  The Bible contains this promise: "For God has not given us a Spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7)."|`|78Xb7enMaa	If you don't want to go to your Doctor you could try an internet search for youth counselling and find somewhere in your area.

Please talk to someone, you deserve to take good care of yourself.  :0)|`|cg25f4vmaa	Wow buddy.. it looks like you're going through a really hard one! Ok well in my opinion, have you thought about why and how the cutting helps you feel better? If so, are there any other alternatives instead? I don't know you, but I really care. I've had suicidal feelings myself, problems with emotions, and hell, its not a good feeling at all. Feels like the end of the world doesn't it!.. I think that therapy is the best help out there. I'm taking therapy too, and its working a bit. To say the truth, I think that your mother should understand that you want to get better. I think maybe if there's a chance, you can tell her you're NOT just a moody teenager. You want to get help. You want to be better. Please do not give up. There's hope out there. You just have to find the right kind of help. And you are NOT ALONE. There's several people that feel the way you do buddy. You are NOT stupid. In fact, I think you're a great person, you want to improve, you don't want to stay this way, and just you asking for help, is already an awesome start! Never ever give up buddy! You can get better! Its really our choices and decisions that can decide our fate. Whatever feels right for you to do buddy!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped a bit <br>  <br>  & remember<br>  <br>  NEVER EVER GIVE UP!|`|xMJXJPrDaa	Everytime you feel like hurting yourself call this hotline 1-985-655-2500 this will help you and put a smile on your face.|`|NoTA4Tp5aa	A few of my friends have self harmed before but they only did it a few times.

You may think your mum is angry but she loves you and is probably just worried about you.<br>  xoxo<br>  The more you hold things inside the more it will bottle up and become something bigger than it needs to be.

I would just tell you mom you want to go to counseling and make sure she doesn't take no for an answer. If she doesn't listen go to your school counselor. talk to her or have her call your mom and get her to take you to counseling that way.|`|u0OuE30Kaa	Ok well I know exactly how you feel, when I was 14-16 I was a cutter and I did a ton of things. I went to counseling and it only helped so much because I soon found that I wasn't the one with issues, it was my mom. What I ending up finding was I was just being put down verbally by my parents, they where making me feel like an outside, different, stupid, useless, and many other horrific things. The one piece of advice that i can give you is stop for a moment, look at your life. Why are you doing this, is this just a temporary thing, what are you really getting out of this. One of the best things I can say to you is Ask Why? all the time look at the deeper meaning in things, like why cut, why is my mom acting in such a way, why do i feel so down. You will then realize soon that sometimes the reasons are small and pointless. In my situation I figured out fast that the problem I had was my mom's way of raising me. So instead of punishing my self, I used the anger, and sadness on a new energy. I created a new train of thought, I would use all the things my mom and dad did wrong to me and raise my kids the right way. By looking at my parents faults I am learning how to better my self. And you can use this for all aspects of life. Why is your teacher being so rude, why do some people dislike you, is it you or them. Many times it's just you putting the thoughts there. To sum it all up just stop and ask your self why on everything, you will soon see the other side of things. Asking why helped me get out of my depression and I've improved my self greatly. Try it for a week and get back to me. After 1 day you will see some changes.|`|vPAftdO7aa	You sound honest. I know you're most likely stereotyped a lot for "cutting" because a lot of teenagers do it for attention. It doesn't seem like you do it for attention, this seems real. I think you need to trust someone and open up fully. Go to your mum and be serious, don't be frantic, just sit her down and seriously tell her that you need someone to help you through this. If she doesn't take an action, I'm sure you could go to a school counselor and ask him/her to talk to your parents about you going back into counseling. <br>  <br>  Nobody is "rubbish." You have a chance every day to be the person you WANT to be, try it.|`|w8USgQMsaa	Hi, i felt the same when i was your age , i did not self harm but i was really depressed, i did not know what help there was, i suffered for years , but i now have it under control thanks to anti depresants ,i was really surprised that they work.<br>  You need to see your doctor they can help, make sure you mention your suicidal thoughts so they take you seriously, i have citalopram and its changed my life.<br>  Your depression is an ilness just like any other ,and should be treated as such, you only feel this way because of the ilness and antidepressants will help.<br>  I hope this helps.<br>  And you can take yourself to the doctor your mum dosent have to be there.
UwNKFSBeaa	psychologist.|`|3664e2604d702b7001b81d717396f845aa	Definitely a psychologist. Medical drugs should only be used as a very last resort in my opinion.<br>  <br>  What if your body learns to depend on them and you need them just to stay happy?<br>  <br>  What if once you get used to them you need more and more to keep them working?<br>  <br>  People can die from accidental overdoses because the prescribed amount didn't work for them so they took more. If you can fix your problems without them, then that is definitely preferable.|`|dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	If you're contemplating therapy, you actually need to see both to successfully overcome your issues. The psychiatrist will prescribe meds to help you get through the rough spots that you will address with the psychologist.|`|ae5e07d692af581a55681b5e8c0e5539aa	Psychiatrist<br>  I'm not very good at helping people solve problems with words. so to be able to prescribe something for them would probably help them out a lot more then i could
sR6Ta9dNaa	Try a relaxing hot bath and/or a hot tub. If that doesn't fully sooth the pain, i usually take tylenol, it helps me a lot, more then stupid midol. If those doesn't really help then try to really get your mom to get you on the pill. Tell her that it doesn't only help but,<br>  1. Regulates your period. <br>  2. Makes it more normal, really. <br>  3. Protects from many things, though tell her your not going to be a crazy teenager and do everything that contains a penis. <br>  4. Tell her the pain is unbearable and don't want to suffer any longer.<br>  5. Ask for the pill that only regulates the period, not protect against pregnancy.|`|Y67BsXXwaa	try a hot bath or hot water bottle or pain killers. if that doesn't work you could always go on the pill that help period paid! even if your mother didnt know. but only really use as a last resort . xxxxxxx good luck|`|pvjZEIDRaa	Try getting a hot water bottle thing or heatable bean bag thing and holding it on there...some ice packs can be microwaves...I find putting heat on it makes cramps a little less painful.|`|Ngj3lfYcaa	Take a hot shower or bath and exercise  a lot. it will ease the pain.|`|133fbaae12aea87a46be219fcee95c99aa	aww man i know exactly what your going through...pretty much the same thing for me.  i usually end up coming home from school on my 2nd & 3rd day.  when u get home take a nice hot bubble bath then go lay down on your bed w/ all the lights turned off & maybe some soft music on to calm you some & try laying on a heating pad [[if you don't have a heating pad i STRONGLY suggest you buy 1 or at least get an old sock, fill it w. white rice & tie a knot @ the end & lay on that]] & you can also try taking some Excedrin extra strength pills & then take a nap...trust me hun it helps alot|`|H0uovbcaaa	I'm 25 and I've have always had very bad cramps. The only thing that will help me sometimes is to take a relaxing bubble bath. Avoid caffeine while you're on your period and try to stay active (I know it's hard!) but walking will help alleviate the cramps. They also sell heating pads at Target or Wal-Mart that you can stick to the insides of your clothes that last eight hours when you can't stay home. Heat helps relieve the pain.
sXU3RrfWaa	My boyfriend and I are trying to figure out the same thing. The research on it yields such varied results. Some studies are showing that there is only a slightly lower percentage of men unable to have kids within a year if they have varicocele. My boyfriend is majorly stressed about this, to the point where if kids come up or I get my period he gets depressed for days. I blame this on his doctor giving him the doomsday talk that he has to give someone with varicocele for liability purposes. Dr's always give the worst case scenario.<br>  <br>  I think that the lack of consistent information on this is a testament to the fact that infertility or subfertility related to varicocele has to be judged on a person by person basis. My boyfriend and i are going to just keep giving getting pregnant a go.
dMMc8QYHaa	Just as much as your body tells you. All those facts about "perfect weight" are in my opinion pure bullshit etc etc, just for earning money so on so on. The best you can do is to eat good food and do exercises every day, then your body will have the perfect condition.|`|4IwTGwpyaa	If you're a yank or a Pom-  87kg is a fair weight. <br>  <br>  If you're from the far east - 50kg<br>  <br>  It really depends on what your society will tollerate. For example : In the US you can be what ever you like. However, in Japan, you may be politely reminded by your homestay mum, teacher, etc,  to take care of a weight problem if any.
RNCEdyJbaa	I'm one of those people who goes to the gym just about everyday (5-6 days a week) and have seen some great results.  The key is to do your cardio regularly and use weights on alternating muscles.  I know a lot of females are reluctant to use weights in their workout routine, because they think they will bulk up, but that is flat out wrong (women's bodies wont bulk up unless they take a lot of supplements, they just aren't built the same).  I definitely recommend you include light weights daily in your routine, this will definitely tone you up and give you much faster results.<br>  <br>  As far as giving your body a rest, you can do that by alternating muscles worked.  Even if you go to the gym just 3 days a week, I would recommend focusing on the following muscles together:<br>  <br>  Chest & Triceps<br>  Back & Biceps<br>  Lower body (legs)<br>  <br>  Also, you can work your stomach muscles everyday as they don't require rest.  In order to get real results, you should definitely mix up your workout routine about every six weeks.  To learn new exercises, just watch other people and carefully try it yourself, that is how most of us learn (you could also just ask someone to show you what they are doing).  As long as you know 3 or 4 different workouts for each muscle, and switch them up regularly, you will see great results which will keep you going back.  Hope this helps.|`|M3BFlxlraa	hi there, it really depends on what your trying to tone muscle wise, and your age is important too. I really dont know what girls do at the gym other then run on tredmills/stairmaster etc. and i only say that because i'm not a perv and go to the gym and watch girls work out but any way.<br>  <br>  So monday you work out your upper body, such as biceps and triceps.<br>  <br>  On tuesday work out your core, such as your abs (i think a girl with abs is hot lol) but you can do crunches<br>  <br>  wendnesday you can do legs and jog.<br>  <br>  Thats just an idea of what you can do. but remember its important to rest the muscles you worked out the other day and work another set!|`|AA11610779	Actually, I think you can go 6 days a week but you'd need to exercise only some parts of your body. For example, one day you exercise the upper part of your body, and the day after the lower part, and so on. You can do that easily if you use machines. But if you do aerobics (or steps, etc.), then every other day is good cos your muscles need to rest. It will actually be more effective.|`|MDgVPwU3aa	if it's to lose weight, 4-6 times weekly<br>  to maintain, 1-2 times weekly|`|XYAaRG1Baa	I don't think that there is a right answer to this question, it's really what you are capable of. I would suggest taking at least one day of rest every week, and if you are serious about toning up then go the other 6 days.|`|5oy46Dwuaa	see heres the thing you can go once say every two days or every other day but when your there you need to work more body parts harder.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  you go everyday but work one body part medium. and rest out the sunday<br>  <br>  <br>  id go with option two an d do it like this<br>  <br>  <br>  mon-bi<br>  tues-chest<br>  wed-tri<br>  thurs-legs<br>  fri-back<br>  sat-sholders<br>  sun-rest(<br>  <br>  i think i coverd the main parts up but also work abs evferyday thats how you get 6 pack

SkDomhoXaa	you need psychoanalytic therapy, it you have no good thoughts they will help you find out why|`|fofzdoROaa	Keep trying to impress your psychotherapist (if you have one, if not see one) with the lack of success of your previous treatment.|`|il9Tdmchaa	I would definitely get ahold of your psychiatrist and impress upon them that you do need some kind of medications.There are so many out there that work either singularly or in conjunction with others. CBT therapy never worked for me either. I did finally find relief when I was put on the right combination of medications. I also talk with a counselor but there again you need to find one that you really get along with. I didn't with my first two. You can do this. It seems like a lot of work but it really isn't that bad. I hope you can make this work. I've just gotten over a deep depression myself and I know how very hard it is to pull yourself up. Little by little you'll be able to also. wishing you strength and courage.|`|soJwuVdnaa	You may need to continue to try other types of medications until you find one that is right for you.  If you're trying SSRI's like Zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin, etc you may need to try a different type of medication.  Sometimes doctors are reluctant to prescribe other types due to increased side-effects, but you can only tell after about a month of continuous use whether the medication will work for you or what types of side-effects you might have.<br>  If you're not currently seeing a therapist, you should find a therapist that you "click" with.  If you don't honestly have a good relationship with your therapist the therapy may be ineffective.<br>  If you've tried everything and are still not seeing results an alternative method of therapeutic release may be in order. Several clinics offer group therapy, art therapy, cooking classes, yoga and other activities that are supervised and supported by a psychiatric staff.|`|cku5S9WLaa	Anti-depressant pills and CBT didn't work much for me either. Its not for everyone. Do you like photography, art, clay modelling, etc ? You can sign up for some evening classes. I find art quite relaxing/theraputic. You need to find something you enjoy doing. It will get you out the house and enjoy yourself.
YQ9YXcEkaa	The symptoms you're describing could possibly be related to lymphoma.  But much more likely they are being caused by a virus or other infection.  There are a lot of viruses and infections going around right now.<br>  <br>  Typically, nodes involved with lymphoma enlarge gradually, are painless, rubbery, and firm.  Tender, soft nodes tend to be related to a virus or infection.<br>  <br>  Your doctor is correct that sometimes lymph nodes can remain enlarged after an infection or virus.  The nodes enlarge as part of an inflammatory process and it can take time for this to reduce.  Sometimes the nodes are scarred and never return to normal size (this scarring can happen after an infection or after having lymphoma).  If this happens, it is not dangerous.  (I have multiple enlarged nodes scattered thru my chest following successful treatment for lymphoma.)<br>  <br>  However, since your fever is back, I would go back to the doctor.  This still sounds more like a virus or infection, but perhaps one the first antibiotic did not fully treat since the fever appears to be back now as well. <br>  <br>  Another option, if these nodes are in your neck and you don't trust your doctor,  is to ask about a referral to an ear, nose, and throat doctor for a second opinion.  My father also had lymphoma and he was diagnosed by a ENT who knew exactly what he had even before doing the biopsy.|`|121e1f783a4816a0618a114219dea02baa	Good lord you must be going through mental hell at the moment. I am afraid I have absolutely no idea if you have or have not got Lymphoma I am just an ordinary bloke with no medical training .What I do know tho is that you have got to go back to your doctor and have a good hard talk with him to make sure the antibiotics have cured your health problem.<br>  If you aren't100 percent convinced that you are cured insist on getting further investigations done . You might insist on a scan at the hospital to check .<br>  I hope you go back to your doc tomorrow , be iinsistent don't take no for an answer and take someone with you maybe a parent , partner or sibling.I lost a dear friend through Hodgkin's disease many years ago and I felt she had been badly let down by the doctors not taking her serious enough at the first signs and leaving things to go on too long before even trying to check to see what the cause was . I really do hope all is well for you  and hope that you push your doctors to fully check you out thoroughly.. take care and remember the chances of you having this is pretty damned slim but for your peace of mind at least youve gotta go back to your doc.

I suggest that you get a biopsy done as soon as possible. Good luck to you.|`|74BoPCASaa	The lymphnodes are usually not painfull , unless they are actually pushing on a nerve or something else. Before I was dignosed I had about 3 consecutive nights of drenching night sweats and fever. N o loss of appetite. Just a cold for about a week. A chest exray and a pet or cat scan, blood work should be done. I found my own symptoms and diagnoses on web md. The first doc i went to told me to wait a month and if the nodes in my neck had not gone away, then she would put me on a antibiotic. I was not comfortable with that. So I went to the university of Michigan hospital docs and they found the problem right away. I f it happens to be lymhoma it has almost a curable rate( depending on stage and type.   Good Luck and get a second opinion God Bless

When you loose weight, you're going to loose fat... therefore you will loose some breast size.  25 lbs in 3 months is very doable...<br>  <br>  and btw... 34 H and 5'6, with 155 lbs?   Your breasts must be as big as ur head!|`|cae6c8e25d6a61178ea135a0b7c41725aa	yes, you will loose some weight there too. don't have a reduction because a lot of women pay for making it bigger. better exercise and develop muscles around that area, in front and in your back. this will stop a ll the back pains and make your breasts smaller and more toned. at least they'll have a better shape and will be firmer from the exercises. lucky you, I would like to have a bigger size. I'm sure guys like your figer even not toned because of your size so you don't have to loose weight to become more attractive :). it's a good thing to have, not a bad one. I know it can cause problems but they all can be solved. just train your muscles.|`|5LrrwvQuaa	34 H?! really? wow the rest of you must be TINYYY.<br>  <br>  but anyways, if you expect to loose that much weight you will loose weight in your breast.  <br>  I always loose weight in my breast first. <br>  <br>  good luck hun :)|`|rQ1focfZaa	yes when you loose weight you loose it equally all over your body|`|51jR2Lmlaa	They will tighten up and become more "perky" but their size will not change by a lot.

Wait till you get em off then treat yourself to a nice professional teeth whitening :D|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	The strips are best for teeth with no braces because they must be touching the teeth to be effected.<br>  Ask your orthodontist before using them but Teeth Whitening trays would work best because the solution would work its way around the braces. Aqua Fresh makes them and I'm sure some stores like walmart,Target or Walgreen's make a generic version...<br>  <br>  Again just make sure you ask your orthodontist first.|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	They do lighten your teeth by a shade or two.  My dentist says that of all the brands on the market for home use, Crest Whitening is the best.  I have used them.  It needs to be repeated every now and then to maintain the whiteness.  They are gel strips you place on your teeth.  I don't know about braces.  Check with your ortho about this.  I agree with Ally.  Whitening with braces may result in uneven tones on your teeth.|`|AHoCSWofaa	there is an almost gel-like substance on the side that you conform to your teeth that start to almost "bleach" your teeth. as for braces, i wouldn't use them if you have braces. from what i've heard from friends of mine (and seen) is that when they take your braces off they clean your teeth so it's all one shade. since there are spots that have been covered by the braces, they haven't been exposed to life for a while. also, having braces won't allow them to conform correctly to your teeth. i haven't heard of them being bad for people wearing braces, but just to be safe, i wouldn't. nothing lasts forever in cases like this. you'll continue to eat and they'll discolor depending on you diet (esp things like coffee, sodas, etc..) the treatment will last a while but if you don't follow up with a solid dental hygiene then you might as well not do it. you could just use a pre-brush mouthwash and a good whitening toothpaste. you'll get the same results just not in 7 days. i hope this helped :)
FRfz2Tewaa	Cup sizes will vary for every young woman.  It depends on such factors as when you began puberty, and basic things such as what you eat or activities you do can contribute to changing cup sizes.  It seems that you have a larger chest for a girl your age, but bodily changes never happen in the same sequence for everyone.  Your body is just developing in it's own way and there is nothing wrong with that. =) Just be sure to eat right and exercise to maintain your health and everything will be okay.

UlNU2Iydaa	The way you eat is how we are meant to eat, though you sound like your metabolism is very fast if you don't stay full no matter what you eat. It is most healthy to eat many small meals and snacks throughout the day, but our society has made a tradition out of eating 3 meals a day. That means that your way of eating is not wrong, just different. If you are concerned about your weight then you can tweak the kinds of food you eat, and see what works for you. If your fast metabolism worries you, you could see a doctor to have your thyroid and other hormone levels checked to see if everything is the way it should be. <br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that you are normal, and you have a pretty healthy eating cycle as long as you are not over eating, you excises regularly, and choosing healthy selections for each meal. Everyone gets cranky when they are hungry, and some days you simply may not feel hungry while your stomach is telling you otherwise. Stress, life, illness, and pressures tend to suppress appetite regardless of the actual fullness of your stomach. From your listed symptoms you seem normal, but if it still concerns you or you find that you are suffering discomfort by living this way, see a doctor to be sure.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ftqiciLpaa	My best advice to you is to stop little by little because your body is used to that same daily routine if you start decreasing the ammount you eat daily it may help a lot, .. just go little by little until your body starts getting used to it again.. good luck|`|K2dNndE2aa	I agree with the first answerer....your body has gotten used to this cuz you always do that...This same thing happens to me with coca-cola..I have to have one around 12:30, 3, 5, then anytime after or I get bad headaches and if I get really nervcous and feel weird if I miss a time....it's cuz I'm addicted to it.<br>  <br>  Try cutting back...likeee, skip 10:30, for example;..and try to make it to 12:40. Then when you're used to that, then cut back another time, likee 4...keep cutting back until you eat at breakfast, lunch, and dinner...if you really feel like you need to eat, eat some fruit or something healthy for you as a snack.|`|i8AeUoKbaa	Thats normal.  How much do you eat on each sitting?<br>  Everyone gets cranky when hungry - it comes from the time that humans had to hunt for food so we get cranky and aggressive in order to catch food.  Some are worse than others.  I definetly get cranky when i'm hungry|`|723ae3923619bae2900e713f6d216e8eaa	Do you have increased thirst along with increased hunger? You may need to be screened for diabetes. Other than that it may be Hypothyroidism, Anxiety, bulimia, or pre menstrual syndrome. I hope this helps|`|i63kfmPxaa	more info needed, age, helps, if you in your teens it's most properly growth spurt. are you over weight?|`|hw85EC1Laa	Your body has got into this routine, as it is suitable to how your day is mapped out<br>  Like, you can't eat in lessons so pyhscologicly your mind isn't allowing it's self to become hungry. As for feeling cranky, this may be due to lack of energy- that you get from food.<br>  Jusy carry on the way you are, but if the amount you're eating worries you then change what you are eating.<br>  Or maybe you could eat more carbs, as they slowly release energy- unlike sugars which release it very quickly and then manke you feel down.
FExrXqsKaa	The short answer is you can't but there are some things you can do to take care of yourself and your son, and to encourage your boyfriend to get help.<br>  .Your boyfriend may need a legal consequence.....someone may have to press charges if he's stolen form them.  You and your child may need to leave and not return until you're satisfied he's well on his way in recovery.<br>  It is very difficult for someone to stop using on their own.  I would encourage you and his mom to attend some sort of self help meetings for your own support.  Alanon or naranon are two options.  You can learn more about these support groups online or by placing a call to a local substance abuse outpatient clinic.<br>  If your boyfriend ends up getting arrested see if there is a Drug Treatment Court available to him.<br>  You must first and foremost take care of yourself and your son and make sure you both are safe.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Tell him he either admits it and gets real help (a drug program) or you will leave him and take his son with you .  ... You need to stick to it . <br>     This is for you and your child .|`|CHRsYrQ0aa	sweet talk him tell him how he has a son and a girl friend to live for. Tell him how he is gonna die if he does not halt. How his son will have to graduate School with out his dad being present. Tell him how much harder your life will be. And try to get him to join rehab. set up and intervention.|`|52E9NR2Waa	Sorry that you are going through this....wow that's a tough one.  The only thing I know about this is that people absolutely can't get help unless they want help and admit they have a problem, and obviously that's the part you are struggling with.  If I were in that situation, I'd get down to the bottom of my feelings.  Tell him how much you care about him and want him to be healthy and happy, sometimes pouring your heart out instead of 'lecturing' helps (unless you have tried this already)..maybe sometimes people get so frusturated about situations like this that they forget to say what they really feel.  <br>  Good luck to you
Ldra6te8aa	Just keep yourself calm, and stay in a relaxed environment.<br>  If you worry about it, you will trip bad, AND A BAD TRIP IS HELL!!<br>  Don't do it at a party or outside, you might hurt yourself or get into a fight, do it in a safe place, like yours or a close friend's house, and have somebody sober (not high) with you guys to keep you calm if you start freaking out.|`|PPFonRYdaa	It's not as bad as you think.

Older brothers, uncles, cousins, classmates you can ask for tips on shaving technique?  shaving & pimples=ouch.  right after a hot shower is a good time.  as long as you are using a new fangled multiblade safe razor you aren't likely to cut yourself too much but you may want a bit of styptic around.  good luck.|`|fBVPYaAgaa	well just by some razors and shaving cream and do it when hes not looking. and you are ready because if you think you do then you do. also if someone can see it far away then definetly shave

Zgdxavnmaa	Theres not anything you can do. Just eat healthily and get the right nutrients because without these your growth will be stunted. When you do get your period remember to eat lots of things with iron and vitamins and minerals in cos you lose these in your blood. <br>  <br>  And just go with the flow, you will grow in your own time, and everyone grows differently so don't compare. And if you end up being short and small, don't worry- you'll look fragile (in a good way- like a doll) and sweet and having big boobs just wouldn't suit you if your small.<br>  <br>  Oh and you don't stop growing when you start your period (if you do I would still be only 5ft with A boobs cos I started mine when I was 12/13). If I remember rightly you stop growing (boobs etc) by 21 and stopp growing in height around 16/17 (or it could be the other way round lol)|`|yXPVKIvMaa	GINSENG.

These are naturally occurring chemicals that control the development of breasts, the growth of pubic and armpit hair and also control periods. <br>  <br>  Menstruation, or periods, are times when a girl or woman bleeds naturally from the vagina. Periods are a sign of health and show that the body is functioning as it should. <br>  <br>  It is a good idea for a girl to talk to her mother about periods, or if this seems difficult or is not possible, she might prefer to speak to a sister, a cousin or someone else she feels comfortable talking to. <br>  <br>  What happens in the body during a period?<br>  <br>  The female reproductive organs inside a girl's body comprise:<br>  <br>  <br>  the ovaries, which produce eggs and hormones. <br>  <br>  <br>  the fallopian tubes, which connect the ovaries to the uterus. <br>  <br>  <br>  the uterus (womb), a muscular organ where the egg can attach itself once it has been fertilized by a male sperm cell when pregnancy occurs. <br>  <br>  <br>  the cervix or neck of the womb, which connects the uterus to the vagina. <br>  <br>  <br>  the vagina starts at the bottom of the cervix and is the passage that leads outside the body. It does several things. It leads the blood out of the uterus and away from the body. The vagina is also the opening into which the man puts his penis during sexual intercourse and the channel through which a child is born. <br>  <br>  <br>  When a girl reaches puberty, her hormones become active. <br>  <br>  A hormone called oestrogen is made in the ovaries. Oestrogen affects the lining of the womb (endometrium) and makes it grow and develop.<br>  <br>  After 10 to 14 days, the ovaries release an egg, and begin to produce another hormone called progesterone. The egg has now moved from the ovary to the uterus through the Fallopian tube. If the egg has not been fertilised by a sperm, the production of progesterone stops. When that happens, the lining of the womb comes away with a little blood and the girl gets her monthly period. The entire process takes about 28 days.<br>  <br>  When do girls begin to have periods?<br>  <br>  Most girls get their first period when they are 10 to 16 years old. The average age is 12.5 years. Women continue to have periods until they are 45 to 55 years old when the menopause occurs. Periods stop during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  How often do women menstruate?<br>  <br>  Periods happen about once a month. They last for four to seven days after which there is a pause of about 23 days (three weeks or so) until the next period, although the menstrual cycle varies from one girl to another. In some girls it may be longer or shorter than 28 days or it may be irregular, especially in the first few months after they have started. <br>  <br>  It is a good idea to note the days your period occurs in a diary or calendar. This will make it easy to see exactly how many days there are between periods and makes it possible to work out when to expect your next period.<br>  <br>  How do you prepare for your first period?<br>  <br>  It is practical and reassuring to know that there are sanitary towels ready in the bathroom or bedroom to prepare for a first period. <br>  <br>  When a period begins, a sanitary pad is simply placed in the underwear to absorb the blood. It is also a good idea to have a sanitary towel in a school bag, just in case a period begins while she is at school. However, if a girl has not brought a sanitary pad to school and her period begins, she should be able to get them from the school nurse or from a teacher. <br>  <br>  When a girl begins her period, she usually discovers it by noticing blood on her underwear or on toilet paper after drying herself. She may also feel some cramping pain or discomfort in her lower abdomen. <br>  <br>  What do you do with a used sanitary towel?<br>  <br>  When changing a sanitary towel, wrap some toilet paper around the one you have used, or, if the new sanitary towel is sealed in a plastic bag, put the used one into that. Then place it in the waste bin which is almost always located next to the toilet. It should not be flushed down the toilet, as it absorbs water and may block the toilet.|`|QJHE3z1raa	stuffff|`|xkApmtr2aa	lol girl i didnt get mine til i was 14, im a late bloomer too.<br>  you cant really do anything to make you grow, it depends on your family and genetics and stuff.<br>  i just got my growth spurt. my friends always usued to clal me the little one because i was sooo short, and now im taller than all of them and this happened a little bit before i got my period, and after. so usually you dont stop growing til later in your periodd.<br>  dont worry, youll eb okay:)<br>  just drink milk and vegetables! not too much junk food, and keep excercising and stuff! <br>  hope i helped <3

AB8tKKNuaa	I am 16 and just had a baby and I have them all over my legs, butt, boobs, and belly. I know how you feel. They tell me the best thing to do is to use Cocoa Butter lotions and creams. I used them for awhile and they faded pretty fast. Although it is true that they never really go away, simple stretches, drinking lots of water so your body won't feel the need to store water (A major cause in stretch marks) , and applying lotions and creams on (after showers are the best times to do it) for a month or so will help them fade much faster. I started noticing a difference in just a matter of weeks. So good luck to you and no it isn't because your big, it could be just from your body holding too much excess water or it could be because you gained a little wait too fast and or lost it. That is what my doctors at the hospital told me. So no worries chika, hang in there!|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	sorry, stretch marks are scars and as such are permanent.  they fade over time, but never go away completely.  They are not a result of being fat, they are a result of rapid growth, suggest you get some body lotion with vitamin E in it and use it daily to prevent further scars from forming.|`|f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There is a lot of stretch mark treatment available on the market these days. Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin. It has a bioactive topical formula that has a combination of skin firming agents to reduce visible wrinkles and make skin appear firmer<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|F3txRHgaaa	i know how you feel it can totally knock your confidence i tried bio oil it waas gud but yxl works better give them a go<br>  xx
ToILKl6waa	Be calm and remind yourself that although it has the potential to rile someone up in worries, anxiety is physically harmless. Welcome the anxiety and encourage it instead of opposing it. If you do this, it is proven that the anxiety will not mount.<br>  <br>  Drink a bit of water and do not entertain your negative thoughts. Instead replace them with more realistic thoughts and focus on the nature around you. Take a deep breath and let the panic do its course. Begin confronting anxious situations as much as you can and you'll feel more and more comfortable. Realize it is nothing but a feeling that passes. The anxiety does not define who you are.

Your mind is a powerful thing, just remember you make your reality. Choose to be paranoid and you will be. Choose to be logical... and well you get the point. I think it will get easier as you get older. Try to focus on education for the time being(this should help you to overcome your issues in the long run). Try not to worry about what others think of u so much because in the end that won't matter as much as your education will. Just be strong and tough through it!!! You can either let these issues consume your life or you can view them as a challenge which you must overcome.|`|JNAyyZRMaa	thatz so sad!!!! im pretty paraniod 2, i always get the feeling that someones talking about me in a bad way. You prob. have depression, im srry 2 say. calm down a bit, and DEFINETLY talk 2 a doctor. maybe he/she can prescribe a medicine 4 u. Remember, you should have confidence about yourself. Try to set your mind away from these things and focus on more important things like school (lol but it IZ important!!!!) and family. Enter contests to boost your confidence (like GOOD contests dont gamble or n e thing), like maybe an essay contest or some kind of sport event. Join a community or outside sports team and try to win, to boost ur confidence about who u r. MOST IMPORTANTLY, talk 2 ur family. dont wrry- im pretty sure they WILL understand, and spend more time w/ other people. This will set ur mind off worries. Hope u feel bettr!!!!|`|tVF9O1Olaa	As the voices are laughing at you i would say you are suffering from low self esteem which can cause the depression and the anxiety/paranoia. This would also explain why you think people are only talking to you so they can laugh at you. <br>  Keep going to your meetings and ask about cognitive behaviour therapy as this helps change your negative thoughts to positive ones, also i recommend a book called overcoming low self esteem by melanie fennel. I was given this by my nurse as i was exactly the same as you.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|rDsKB0uXaa	idk

Here is a website that has more information: <a href="http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-appendicitis" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders...</a> <br>  But it could be something else. I suggest visiting your doctor ASAP.|`|kTlapd8Aaa	Your appendix might be infected. I would go to the doctor right away because you could die from it. <br>  Don't be worried, just go to the doctor.
f7mosa6vaa	I had two C-Sections with both my children and never had lower rib pain. Did you have a Spinal or some other type where you were awake when giving birth. I was in a lot of pain but only in that area of my stitches and when I coughed or laughed, but never after eating.  Maybe you have a Hyrniated disc, which is something that could cause you discomfort after eating.  I would go to my regular doctor and have him/her check it out.
xnZi0i8saa	No Bipolar itself has not really cause your mindset. As someone above stated... not all bipolars think that much. I am bipolar also and I also don't fit in but it's not just the bipolar it is because people are shallow and self centered and I prefer my own company. I sometimes would like to start a support group for high functioning, intelligent, creative bipolars but that would be considered elitist....|`|MPX0f5jzaa	I wouldn't say that has anything to do w/ bipolar disorder, you're just unsatisfied w/ American culture.

I can relate with you 100%. Cause you have opened your eyes and have seened the world for what it really is.
dpgXzMenaa	Anyone who tells you it's bad for you or "not normal" is either clueless or lying.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|kknSPYxKaa	That person that answered first, he/ she was talking all about having an orgasm.<br>  And that doesn't really answer your question.  I don't see anywhere in your question where you asked about an orgasm.<br>  But anyways, I'm actually going to answer the question for you. :D<br>  It is perfectly fine for a 14 year old girl to masturbate.  There is absoutley nothing wrong with masturbating, even when you are younger than that.  There are no long term consequences to masturbating, even when you are young.<br>  It is just for pleasure and it is so much safer than actually having sex.  My only advise to you would be to make sure your hands are clean and that you check underneath your nails to make sure there is no dirt that could cause infection.<br>  Also, make sure your nails aren't sharp because if they are you could cut yourself and that wouldn't be fun.<br>  And for those people that told you that it is bad to masturbate, don't listen to them, they don't know.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :D|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	I am a daddy of 2 girls that all grown up and have children of their own. They asked their mom that question. She had a girl chat with them and she told them what we both believe. <br>  Masturbation is fun, feels fantastic, healthy, not a sin, will Not make you go blind and it will NOT cause hair to grown in the palm of your hands oh, did I mention it feels fantastic. <br>  There is absolutely nothing wrong with masturbation. Enjoy your body and keep you sex activity to yourself. Do NOT discuss what you do with your girlfriends. Enjoy, oh did I mention it feel fantastic. :  )|`|yXPVKIvMaa	I started touching myself when I was 7 or 8 (but didn't understand what it was, it just felt good). My nanny would get so mad about it and I believe if you are raised in a very religious family you'd be taught that it's extremely "shameful" and a really "evil" thing to do.<br>  <br>  I started masturbating when I was 14, and now years later I'm still live and kicking lol.<br>  <br>  So pls, don't worry about it. It's normal AND healthy.|`|YWaUaPaSaa	Well I read in an article once that it is good for you and you can find out the things that you *<like>* like that. I also heard it helps some people fall asleep and that it releases endorphins which are natural painkillers. It probably also helps your heart becuase you heartrate goes up. IDK these are just snippets of things I have read. Although do not put anything hot or sharp or dangerous near you. And clean eveything before you use it and put it away.|`|C0aMI33Naa	yes, it is normal for everyone to masturbate.<br>  and no it's not bad.|`|7XPITB5iaa	your going thro puberty and its normal to want to do that. ppl do do it they jus dont say anything about it...

Either way you are going to have to see a doctor, so you would be best off having a doctor who knows what he is doing take care of it and not depend on chance.

The only thing I can think of how it is better is that you don't have to spit when you use it. Spitting that stuff into a bottle or somewhere else is just disgusting. And it does take longer for the effect. I just got two free tins of it when I bought camel lights, and it says to keep it in there for 30 minutes to feel any effect.

EdhW394qaa	if smoking in public places is banned, it will force smokers to realize the difficulty smoking is creating in their lives. Now not only do they have to worry about when they can smoke another one, but WHERE...it may lead more smokers to quit. I am a smoker, who is trying to quit. The main reason I am quitting...besides my health of course, is because it is just too much of a hassle now..and I cant smoke on airplanes!  Which interferes with my job if I don't fly. See where this is going, I just decided its too much trouble to keep smoking and killing myself!  So public smoking ban does work to deter smokers!

nxzPUrHKaa	One of the biggest misconceptions is the BMI (Body Mass Index).<br>  <br>  It supposedly takes into account your height n weight n tells you whether you are too big or too small.<br>  <br>  This has been proven to be HIGHLY INCORRECT n yet schools, medical clinics even TV programs use it to give sense to tell people they are either in or out of shape.<br>  <br>  Little do people know is that the Dutch are one of the tallest races on the planet. Asians in general are very small, so there BMI's are either too big or too small and yet they are all perfectly healthy.<br>  Muscle weighs more than Fat, so most professional athletes are deemed to be overweight, although they are some of the bodies people aspire to have.<br>  <br>  You see what I mean.<br>  <br>  People think you are too skinny, but you may not be.<br>  <br>  What you could do, is go into a gym, and ask for a Body Fat test.<br>  all it will tell you what percentage of body fat you have. (Its confidential)<br>  <br>  If you have a very low number then you will just need to increase your food intake (But they will be more than kind enough to help you with Diet Plans), and if they deem you as a healthy size, then you can pass on to all of your critics that you are healthy just the way you are:)<br>  <br>  The Most important thing is, that if you are eating healthy, are not balemic or anorexic, then you have nothing to worry about:)<br>  <br>  In time your figue will fill out slightly.<br>  Its your genetics:)<br>  <br>  you'll be ok :)|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	There is NO set, measure for any of us.

bmoCpcdraa	the best way to shed pounds is to drink no soda ,no diet soda, do not fry any thing .bake fish ,tuna no mayo, bake or boil chicken or turkey, bake enough to last 3 or 4 meals,use extra meat to eat  cold or mix in salad, bake some veggies in same pan to get good flavor,bake extra veggies to re-heat later, make big pot of soup ,with veggies and some chicken and cabbage etc.,make lots of extra so you can re-heat one bowl at a time, drink 6 glasses of water a day ,it is a must,i would carry them small water bottles around with me ,cause you can put the lid on them if they get warm then re-refrigerate ,try not to eat to much bread, try not to eat to late before bed ,eat lots of fruit and veggies, if you have leftovers in frig. you may be  more willing to eat them then a fat snack,get some sliced fat free cheese,you can melt a slice on some veggies to make them taste better, make sure you eat well, it is a healthy choice not a diet,,, hope i helped|`|Vhfb7UACaa	Probably about 175.|`|xfgVGqvXaa	The normal recommendation is that your BMI should be 18.5 to 25.

Of the people who try, only about 5% manage to lose weight and keep it off.<br>  <br>  My own experience is that exercise works better than diet.  The fitter I get, the more difference exercise makes.  I go running: four runs of 3.75 miles each week.  At the moment each run is taking me about 27 minutes, and it's noticeably easier to keep my weight down than it was when the runs were taking 28:30.

pvYy6iTSaa	Winston - A skin color change around the hairline suggests a change caused by some applied chemical.  Perhaps the hair-coloring tint has a substance in it which does not easily wash out from the skin.  Was the start of its appearance when hair-color was applied.  If the color is in the skin, perhaps applying some protective vaseline coating on the skin before the dye would keep the dye away from bare skin.  Some persons smart enough to avoid tanning machines or excess sun might apply a quick-tanning skin liquid for a more "attractive" or healthy appearing skin, or the product might contain some contaminant which the skin hold on to and produces the dark color along the hairline where applied?

If you ARE pregnant, you are running out of time to decide what you're going to do about it.<br>  <br>  Saying you don't have money and can't go to a doctor, please provide the answer is not going to work. You need to find the money/transportation/support somewhere.

hFs2lcfgaa	in one word, yes, but it isn't the same kind you get "down there" so i wouldn't be worried.  cold sores come and go so i would just keep using blistex but, there is no way to tell when one is coming|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	Yes.<br>  As long as a lesion is present, you can pick up the virus by sharing the same glass immediately after the infected person has used it.  This is true for anything that comes into contact with the lesion: chapstick, toothbrush, etc.<br>  <br>  Always best to use your own glass, bottle, etc.<br>  - - -<br>  Herpes simplex one is the virus that prodcues cold sores.  You will feel a tingling sensation right before the lesion comes out.  A full blown lesion can be prevented with a prescription called xovirax cream.<br>  <br>  My parents kissed me as a child (they didn't know any better about the spread of these) and I had cold sores every school picture day throughout my childhood.  Xovirax has all but eliminated them for me.

They are great as  I have tried some for my child who is suffering from sinus and some of them works. You see all of us are biologically different and what works for some might not work for you. Keep searching, never give up, eventually you will find one which will work for you. Home remedies are funny, once you strike a remedy which works for you, you will be cured within just a matter of days.

Delaying could cause permanent ear damage.|`|CnSaGHqWaa	I have suffered from sinus infections for years. Always the same once or twice a year, I would get a cold (lot of running nose) and take the normal over the counted medications. Eventually my cold would turn into a pain around my eyes to the point where I could only work a few hours a day and sleep was the only remedy, with a visit to the doctors office after I couldn't take it anymore. What an issue in my life!!  By the way, I'm not saying it will make it go away, I believe it helps your body prevent it.<br>  <br>  Like I said, I would get the infection once or twice a year, that is, until I started taking Apple Cider Vinegar. That was about 8 years ago, and haven't had a sinus infection since. Most people I know can't even stand the thought of taking a shot of Apple Cider Vinegar in the morning (suppose it would not matter when you take it) but that's what stopped my infections and I think it was and is worth it.
MClFrDE1aa	It could be related. Snoring can be caused by being overweight (this is the number one factor), undiagnosed allergies (this is the number 2 factor) or sleeping on our back. He should try losing just a little weight. It really helps. In the meantime, he should use a warm mist-humidifier at night. He should also use the tennis ball trick. You put  a tennis ball in a sock and pin it to the back of the shirt he sleeps in. Then, if he rolls over on to his back at night, the ball will nudge him back on to his side. Whatever you can do to help him stop snoring, it's worth it. Snoring has been linked to a 67% increased risk of stroke.

Without protein, your energy level will go down and you won't be able to function very well. Basically your body will shut down because your diet is not sustainable.

mMzXeOhmaa	You can get different types of birth control pills that you do not need to take withthin the first five days. I have heard so many bad things about depo shot. I have seen my friend gain 50lbs on it. and heard stories or weight gain. Even my gyn told me that. <br>  I got on mirena, because it works as soon as it is inserted, lasts for 5 years and not significant weight gain and most peoples periods stop. mine has. <br>  So i recommend talking to your doctor about all of your concerns he will tell you what is right for you and ask what the risks are for the birth control. Such as effectiveness, and side effects, ect. <br>  Good luck :] and Do not be nervous. They see that stuff everyday! My doctor told me it was a waist of time to be scared because they see that stuff everyday and just do there job. Lol I have gotten so many!!!|`|JUrcvLklaa	Gynocologists suggest that you start any birth control on the first day of your period, or the first sunday...  This is because your hormones are at their lowest at this point, and it also helps you to remember when to start a new pack (for pills)  If you start the pill or shot in the middle of your cycle (ie NOT at the begining of your period) then your hormones can be messed up and there is a greater chance that your birth control will fail and you will become pregnant...   <br>  <br>  I suggest that you visit the gyny, then follow their suggestions for when to start the BC...  Just use an alternative method of protection until then... They will tell you when to begin and all the instructions...  I also suggest that you look into the side effects of different BC methods and try and get an idea of what you think is best for YOU!. <br>  <br>   For example, if you have extremely heavy periods, sometimes BC like Loestrin24fe would be best to limit your periods to around 3 days...  Depo-provera is known to stop your periods completely while you are on it, but it is a 3 month shot and if you have adverse effects to it, those effects can last for up to 8 months sometimes...  Also I have heard of a lot of people having problems on it..<br>  <br>  Do some research on your own, and then talk to your gynocologist!
6MIKvXmzaa	Wow there are an awful lot of ignorant people out there.  Sex Ed is designed to make you aware of how your body functions, what changes are taking place, and how to deal with them.  They will discuss how specific STD's are transmitted and what the consequences are and whether or not they are treatable.  You will learn more in depth about HPV and the complications with Cervical Cancer.  And yes organs are discussed but you would think people could grow up a bit to help comfort this young woman who is concerned about what she should be prepared to learn about in an uncomfortable class.

xjHJlTx0aa	When you receive your contact lenses you should be instructed on removing and putting them on, cleaning and taking care of them.   To clean your contacts you should use a multipurpose solution like Renu, Complete, or (my fav)Optifree replenish.  Take out your lenses store them in your case with fresh solution every night.  Put them on directly from the case or you can rinse them with the solution before putting them on.  Rinse your case with fresh water and let air dry until you store your lenses again.<br>  Hope this helps|`|7H3CoXfIaa	You just have to empty the solution, then put new solution in and then put the contacts in, every night before you go to sleep, and you will then wear glasses maybe if you stay awake for a while.|`|6Wz01oZ4aa	Well you take them out nightly before you go to bed. To take them out, they will teach you that when you get them. You want to change your soution in your case everynight before you put your contacts into the case. You will want to rinse your contacts before you put them in. Protien can build up in them and make them blurry. If this happens just put solution on your contact and rub them between your fingers, And then rinse them again then put them into your case.  If you have anymore questions honey ask your doctor when you get them. They will answer them all for you.

There are many things it can be, but it just may be the way your heart works..

DvyWI0qJaa	1. Food cravings. Yes, it's a cliché, but food cravings sometimes can be a sign of pregnancy. Don't rely on them as a sure symptom (it may be all in your head, or even a sign that your body is low on a particular nutrient), but if cravings are accompanied by some of the other symptoms on this list, start counting the days from your last period. <br>  <br>  2. Darkening of your areolas. If the skin around your nipples gets darker, you may have successfully conceived, though this may also signal a hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy. <br>  <br>  3. Implantation bleeding or cramping. 3. About eight days after ovulation, you may experience implantation spotting, a slight staining of a pink or brown colour, as well as some cramping. This is caused by the egg burrowing into the endometrial lining. You might also see some spotting around the time you expect your period. <br>  <br>  4. Frequent urination. Once the embryo implants and begins producing the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), you may find yourself going to the bathroom more often. <br>  <br>  5. Fatigue. Feeling tired? No, make that exhausted. High levels of the hormone progesterone can make you feel as if you've run a marathon when all you've done is put in a day at the office. Fatigue is a hallmark of early pregnancy, though probably not a surefire symptom on its own. <br>  <br>  6. Tender, swollen breasts. If you're pregnant, your breasts will probably become increasingly tender to the touch, similar to the way they feel before your period, only more so. Once your body grows accustomed to the hormone surge, the pain will subside. <br>  <br>  7. Altered sense of taste. You may notice that your sense of taste changes. Some women say they have a metallic taste in their mouth, others that they cannot stand the taste of coffee, tea, or a food they usually like. <br>  <br>  8. Morning sickness. If you're lucky, morning sickness won't hit you until a few weeks after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But as early as a couple of days following conception, you may begin feeling nauseated and queasy. And not just in the morning, either -- pregnancy-related nausea can be a problem morning, noon, or night. <br>  <br>  9. A missed period. If you're usually pretty regular and your period is late, it's worth trying a pregnancy test. A missed period is the surest sign of pregnancy in a woman of childbearing age who usually has regular periods. <br>  <br>  And finally... <br>  <br>  10. A positive home pregnancy test. If you've waited to test until at least the first day of a missed period and a blue line appears in the test window, you're most likely to be in the family way. Make an appointment with your doctor to confirm the good news|`|RWxUqoD3aa	go to your GP to have a blood test to see if your iron levels are low, if you are stressed it could cause you to feel ill, or you could go to a family planning clinic to have a pregnancy test done|`|JghXh9dQaa	why dont you do a pregnancy test your no if your ill or not then|`|M6y69Y6gaa	You might not be pregnant.<br>  But it sounds like you're possibly suffering from dehydration.

I'm being serious, when i was younger and wasn't getting much pleasure from guys, i would use the faucet from the tub. Let the water run as if filling the tube for a bath and lay in there put your legs against the wall and let the water fall on your [ah-hem] lol. It will feel good and hopefully make you orgasm.

Ezcyodycaa	Ha HA! This is EXACTLY what happened to me! And....<br>  <br>  My doctor diagnosed me with ADHD, OCD, Chronic Depression, Anxiety/Panic Disorder, AND insomnia. Sounds crazy, but if you think about it all "mental illness" is is brain working outa whack and the symptoms it creates. My Psychiatrist told me what he thinks happened to me is that all the problems were connected and I needed to understand what my thinking process was doing to me, leading me to the point where I freak out.<br>  <br>  So, I broke down what my mind did when these kinds of situations were brought up to me. I remember sitting in class, trying to do my homework or read or whatever. I remember almost a dizzy feeling coming over me, like I would get all confused and have trouble focusing on words. Like, I could see them just fine...Normally I was great at reading and soaking up the information...but I would just keep reading the sentence, whispering to myself, my mind racing, feeling more and more confused. I'd slow the words down as I said them, but still just didn't understand what it said, or maybe I was afraid I didn't understand it. I'd start looking around the class. Maybe zone out looking at the clock. I'd start needing to get up, I'd feel so anxious. And then something would bring to my attention, "Oh yeah, I have work to do..." Then I'd try again, same problem. I'd start to look through my folder, look at my grade report, maybe to get some motivation to work harder. Ds and Fs or 0s for my assignments...my tests and essays however were all As...and I was still close to failing...It made me panic. Sometimes I would just try to stay calm. I might just give up and say, "I'll try again later". And I'd draw or something. Maybe just put my assignment away and pretend I was finished. My teacher knew I was smart. But she also knew I did not have a good history on turning my assignments in completed, if I turned it in at all. Half the time she would come over to me when she saw me doing nothing and would start talking to me. She knew I had troubles at home, lots of stress. She was a really good teacher. But her talking to me would just push me over the edge, and half the time I'd get sent to the counselors office because I would start to cry or hyperventilate, whatever. <br>  <br>  This was all also linked to me thoughts of what was going on at home. My Dad was always disappointed in my grades. He knew I was smart, but he always called me lazy. I just couldn't think straight. Oh GOD and then in reading they gave us all this hard material in Old English we had to read...The teacher would give us assignments to read a chapter and do some worksheet, saying it should only take us 15 minutes or so to do, but I would sit for like, 2 hours trying to read the chapter. I liked the stories, I liked to read, but I just...couldn't. And then my Dad would be disappointed in me, and he'd drink...and put on tons of weight in like, 3 years...I thought it was all my fault...gah.<br>  <br>  The only thing that kept me from skipping school was the fact the Orchestra was 8th hour and the music helped me think straight. It was like a drug for me.<br>  <br>  Eventually I was put in an Alternative Learning Class for "bad kids" and kids with ADD ADHD, whether or not it was diagnosed. They would put us all in there because then our grades wouldn't reflect on the mainstream school percentages. They just gave us these really easy to read big-print books and have us read them and do the reviews at the end, put in 60 hours of class, and we'd be done. It was a lot easier but I didn't learn anything new.<br>  <br>  So, basically the disorder in my life led to the depression which led to the ADHD which led to the OCD which led to the panic and anxiety and then I'd have trouble sleeping because of all of it. Sound like you at all? You feel down, maybe in a kinda funk, and then you just can't think straight, or as clearly, and then you start to obsess over it, and then you get all anxious and then you have trouble sleeping, maybe feel restless. Also consider that it could be ADD rather than ADHD. ADHD doesn't mean hyper like you're bouncing off the walls necessarily, in my case it was the rate my mind would start to go and the restless feelings. And I don't remember being like that when I was a kid, I think all the little details like diet and the stress level going up in down in my life as I grew up also affected the way all the "illnesses" popped up. <br>  <br>  The whole thing basically led to me being a complete psycho when I was 18 and moved out of the house. I managed to graduate on time, but I had to be in ALC for 14 hours every day to make up for all the classes I failed in mainstream in order to walk accross that stage. I worked real hard for it. But when I moved out and my Dad still wasn't proud of me, in fact he practically shunned me, I started to have hostile panic attacks on a regular basis any time the thought of my family came up or if he called me.  <br>  <br>  It wasn't till this point that I finally got diagnosed. My|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Don't listen to any of the idiots who are saying it's ADD this sounds nothing like that but it does sound like you may have a mild case of OCD|`|7haoi6xHaa	OMG! you are just like me. I have no idea what it is though, I'm sorry. =/|`|XyD7tITxaa	It could be ADD or OCD, or both, if that's possible. Sorry you are feeling this way.

You really should be much more specific, but here goes.<br>  <br>  Yes.<br>  <br>   I fell out of a tree many times when I was a child.  Years later, I lost my virginity.  So you CAN lose your virginity even if you fell out of a tree.<br>  <br>  If you are one of two parties in a tree, engaged in coitus, that is a penis is penetrating a vagina, and you fall out of the tree, you have lost your virginity.  Falling out of the tree does not negate the fact that you engaged in coitus.  (Of course some defined virginity differently, but the convention is that never having engaged in vaginal intercourse is what makes one a virgin.) Note also that orgasm need not occur, and indeed for many it remains an elusive idea, rather than a result of coitus(vaginal intercourse)<br>  <br>  Now, the question that you might actually be asking is, "Can you lose your hymen if you fall out of tree?"  A hymen is a membrane partially covering the external vaginal opening, often referred to as a "cherry".<br>  <br>  Yes, you can tear and lose your hymen if you fall out of a tree, but this does not mean you are not a virgin.  You might actually not lose your hymen from coitus (vaginal intercourse) and indeed some women  have parts of their hymen intact even after giving birth. <br>  <br>  So having or not having a hymen does not negate virginity, engaging in coitus(vaginal intercourse) does.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If|`|ANsznbWsaa	you can break your hymen....<br>  but that doesn't mean you lost your virginity.|`|95f9fbd65bd5cca87e4b843390b3468eaa	hahahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha you made me giggle... lmao!

The bump could be caused by that as well. But before you start taking over the counter treatments go to the doc to be sure. You don't want to take anything if you don't need it. But in the meantime, just eat a lot of garlic and plain sugar free yogurt [assuming it is a yeast infection]. Also, being sore and not able to sit down, i think that's cause he's too big.

As for the clear fluid, if you have been having sex or masturbating while having your period it's normal for there to be clear fluid because your vagina automatically lubricates when you're turned on to prepare your body for sex. This can happen during your period, I've had it happen. If you are having unprotected sex, you need to change that...it's so risky!! Not only for pregnancy but for STIs. It's so careless, and I've seen so many of my friends get pregnant because of it. You can make it sexy for him to wear a condom, like putting it on with your mouth...but seriously, you need to protect yourself and it can't hurt to take a pregnancy test to check or even to go see a doctor or talk to a parent, because you can get pregnant from pre-ejaculate even if he hasn't came yet.|`|Gc2TxixDaa	Clotting is normal but you can use the rule of thumb here...if the clots are bigger than a quarter and you have a lot of cramps go see your doctor.|`|DvyWI0qJaa	mmmmm....strange i usally get like blood clot kinda things but i dnt get them like u tho so i suggest go 2 da doctor or tell some1|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Ease your mind and see a doctor.|`|NSLE4JImaa	It's probably not a dead baby.

dpgXzMenaa	You haven't put it in far enough, and it's bugging the muscles and sensitive tissues near the entrance of your vagina.<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	Best source is ask your Mom if available.|`|ANsznbWsaa	you didn't put it in far enough. <br>  take it out, try again.|`|qM4QLi8faa	if it hurts then you have it in wrong.<br>  just take it out and try again..<br>  it takes practice before you can insert it correctly.<br>  <br>  and don't worry about "putting it in the wrong hole" cause you cant fit it in your pee hole and you would DEFINITELY know if you put it in your butt hole.<br>  <br>  use a mirror standing up with your legs open and try to slide it directly in.<br>  goodluck and don't sweat it if you can't get it the first few times.<br>  it took me a while too. :]|`|M6y69Y6gaa	Try relaxing yourself before you insert the tampon.<br>  Put your foot on the toilet seat to lift your leg and put it in at an angle pointing forwards, your vagina is at an angle in your body it's not straight up.|`|bhnPUzypaa	You've put it in wrong, take it out and re-insert another one, stay relaxed! If its in properly then you shouldn't feel it|`|DvyWI0qJaa	You may be worried and nervous about using your first tampon. Talk to your mom or a friend who has used tampons. It is important to first learn how to use a tampon and then, just relax! The more you relax, the easier the insertion will be. When you are nervous, your muscles tense up, making insertion even harder. For your first time, you may want to try using a tampon when your menstrual flow is heavy; this should allow the tampon to glide in more easily. Choose the smallest size tampon for the first time. By following these simple guidelines, and those that come with your package of tampons, your first experience with tampons should be easy.<br>  <br>  Sit or stand in a comfortable position. Some women prefer to place one leg on the toilet seat or tub, while others prefer to squat down. After you find a position that is most comfortable for you, hold the tampon with the fingers that you write with. Hold the middle of the tampon, at the spot where the smaller, inner tube inserts into the larger, outer tube. Make sure the string is visible and pointing away from your body. <br>  With your other hand, open the labia (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening) and position the tampon in the vaginal opening. <br>  Gently push the tampon into the opening, aiming for the small of your back. Stop when your fingers touch your body and the applicator, or outer tube, is completely inside the vagina. <br>  Once the applicator or outer tube is inside of you, use your index finger to push the inner tube (the tube where the removal string is visible) through the outer tube. This pushes the tampon into the vagina. <br>  Once the inner tube is all the way in, use your thumb and middle finger to remove the applicator or outer tube. . Make sure that the string hangs outside of the vaginal opening. Later, when you are ready to remove the tampon, hold the string and gently pull it downward until the entire tampon is out. <br>  <br>  <br>   If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not feel it. If you feel uncomfortable in any way, you may have inserted the tampon incorrectly or the tampon may not be placed far enough into the vagina. If this happens, just remove the tampon and start again with a new tampon. Remember that practice makes perfect. If you don't get it on the first try, your second try will most likely be successful. Instead of getting frustrated and giving up, relax and try again!|`|AA11294537	Hi there,<br>  <br>  It may not be in properly or up far enough.<br>  <br>  Remove that one and try again.<br>  <br>  Putting a bit of lubricant or Vaseline on the top can help make it easier to put in properly.<br>  <br>  Try putting you leg up on the edge of the bath or toilet seat.<br>  <br>  If it's in properly, you shouldn't feel it at all.<br>  <br>  Have you tried tampons with an applicator?  This can make things a bit easier.<br>  <br>  If this fails, just use a pad.  Tampons can take practice!|`|776d9a7322dfb39d4d173c68baffd730aa	You probably didn't get it in far enough or you used one that is way too big for you or you put it in wrong. Take it out immediately and wait maybe a day or two before you try again, maybe with a smaller sized tampon.|`|eNjMj48Kaa	it sounds like you dont have it in far enough. When you insert the tampon you should push it in until your fingers touch the outside of your vagina. Dont worry, if its not in far enough just get a new one and try again.|`|hw85EC1Laa	Don't worry, the first time you use them it may feel a little uncomfortable. If discomfort persists, then take it out, but if you keep using them you should fine them okay.|`|GTBl5IrYaa	you didnt put it in far enough, there is no way it can get 'lost' so dont worry.

efbedcf73d7894c8cb179a46753f2cb3aa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Well, it could be just an allergic response to the cream you used and probably there is nothing to worry about. But if it comes to sores, as they also called blisters, before they appear there may be different symptoms, like soreness and pain around the mouth and tenderness of the lips, a fever, a sore throat, or swollen glands. Some people only have very mild symptoms or none at all.<br>  <br>  The first outbreak starts one to three weeks after the virus has been contracted. The first symptom of an outbreak is an unpleasant tingling feeling in the skin. In children, the virus can infect the mouth and throat. The infection may be accompanied by a fever and general aches and pains. After a short while, a number of fluid-filled blisters appear. Cold sores usually break open after the blisters appear, and they leak clear fluid, scab over and then heal. This could take from some days up to two weeks. For some people, cold sores can be very painful. But the pain and discomfort of an outbreak can be minimized by the proper cold sore treatment. Within a few weeks the virus subsides spontaneously.<br>   <br>  I hope this will help!<br>  <br>  Regards, <br>  <br>  vrindaranyam|`|wWkXOfU6aa	cold sore... try medicine for it.... u cant really get a pimple on ur lip|`|K0oY5NTtaa	ya pimplsa r not on ur lip
uYz8ipcJaa	Yup you have anxiety disorder.<br>  <br>  It's a disorder if it's affecting your life negatively and you want to get rid of it.  It's affecting your grades!<br>  It may start to affect other areas of your life soon.<br>  <br>  You're not the only person.<br>  I am 16.  I have anxiety disorder, depression and other stuff.  I am perfectionist and I upset over grades, obsess over getting things right, panic and have to recheck and recheck and recheck things again and again, and social anxiety prevents me from going to talk to people when I really need to, even if it's as simple as asking one question about my job.<br>  I get chills, chest pain, start to shake before recitals etc...<br>  but emotional symptoms are greater.  I can't concentrate. My anxiety ruins performances, tests... I am depressed.  I have a hard time with relationships and don't have friends or close family.<br>  <br>  I've had anxiety disorder ever since I can remember.  I grew up with it.  It's not "a phase" because it won't go away so simply, and not everybody has it.<br>  A lot of adults still have that kind of problem, and it still affects relationships, jobs, and life.  Yes, it's a life-ruining problem.<br>  <br>  So you probably would want professional help, because that's the best thing that you could do right now.  For me, it's not helping THAT much, but it's better than nothing, and I can't do anything else about it.<br>  <br>  If you read things online and it fits you, you're pretty aware already, but you can't do anything about it.  That's very intelligent of you to realize something is wrong and to look it up.<br>  Since you think the descriptions fits you, who else should know better than that? Nobody!  So if you think you have it, most likely you do.|`|7vFylPygaa	yes. i was like that too and seeking professional help really improved my quality of life.|`|CA9G8X8faa	I feel this way also, I'm interested in seeing what people say.|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	professional people suck, like counsiling i mean. its a waste of money|`|LMsuGjcsaa	Yes it is.  From experience it will only get worse.  So tell your doctor and see if there are any techniques or even meds that can help you.  I am sorry you are going through this.

With a 1200 kcal diet it is possible to have a nice varied meal plan and enjoy your life a bit more and stay healthy.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	For a healthy diet you need about 1200 calories a day and your diet needs at least 5 servings of fruit and veggies a day|`|47184ufeaa	I think you need to eat more calories than 1000, to remain at a healthy weight.//<br>  <br>  <br>  And if you want another breadstick and pizza slice, go eat it.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	I know the feeling... Start with cleaning out your cabinets and fridge and get rid of all the junk food, if it ain't in the house you can't eat it, buy lots of veggies and fruits, I'vee been munching on grapes when I get the sweets cravings and that helps. You can buy a week worth of frozen meals (check the label for calories), it will help you with portion control. At work, munch on baby carrots and almonds.<br>  Can't give you advice on exercising because I don't believe in it...lol (my idea of exercise is a good brisk sit...)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: OMG I do the same thing! I don't eat till 2 or 3 pm and then anybody better get outta my way! You (and I) really MUST start eating little things through out the day, I had lost 15 pounds almost and all I did was eat all day long, a hand full of grapes, almonds, an apple, SOMEthing every hour, that way your metabolism stays up and you won't over eat later in the day (when anything you eat will go straight to your hips). Try not to eat after 7:30 pm.<br>  Good luck!|`|jhW8jHb7aa	Start with several small meals a day to regulate your metabolism and maybe try incorporating more walking into your days. That's an easier adjustment than most and will kick-start a healthier lifestyle.

CNSGz12zaa	Of course you should--Chiropractor's rely on feedback from their patients. I am sure he tried to help and still will, tell him you think it was becasue of what he did and see what he offers to fix it.|`|AA10731562	yes definately|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	sue him for malpractice|`|OaxwLOr5aa	sue him, especially if uve been paying him for these visits. n to bad if hes against doctors he dosent control u, honestly u shuldnt be so concerened of hurting his feelings wen ur health is at risk...|`|c4sn6g3xaa	I would discuss it with the doctor and if you can't come to some type of agreement, contact an attorney.|`|211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	Excellent Question!!!<br>  <br>  FIRST:  Get a copy of all your records.  If he gives you any hassle about it, give him a bullshyt story like, "I can't afford it anymore," or "I'm moving out of state and will need a copy of my records."  If he still gives you a hard time - there are still ways around that...<br>  <br>  SECOND:  Your primary doctor - the one who referred you to Physical Therapy, SHOULD have a copy of the records from the Chiropractor anyway.  Once he/she has a copy of those records, you can ask your doc for a copy.  Even if any of the doctors say they will charge you, it will be a relatively small amount and completely worth it.<br>  <br>  THIRD:  If you are really going to sue this guy, you NEED to have any and all records and information about him.  BE PREPARED!<br>  <br>  FOURTH:  Since this is such and excellent question, I would post the exact same question over in the LAW category.  That's what I did with my question about 2 weeks ago and got some really great im<br>  nput.  Ydefinitelyely did the right thing by coming here, now go there for moInformationion.<br>  <br>  I am going through a very similar experience right now.  I have some of the records.  Ha - unfortunately, they "forgot" to send them all.  Bullshyt!  I have not even begun, I'm still scrutinizing over the records.  They did charge me for the copy and my Primary doctor has a copy as well.  My second step will be to find an attorney on retainer.  I do not have the monies upfront for a lawyer, so I will have to go this route.  I hope to sue for as much as I can.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!  Definintely keep me posted by e-mail, I would be very interested in seeing how this goes.  In the meantime, work your Physical Therapy and I wish you good health!!|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	You are right.  It is best to not debate with him.  He is set in his beliefs about chiropractic treatment.  Continue with your regular doctors.  Just tell him you are undergoing other treatment or make a general excuse.  You do not owe him an explanation.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	If you feel that he is not helping you then just stop going.  If you feel that he is hurting you more than you need to have a conversation with him about that.|`|N8DxgAD7aa	If you choose a chiropractor than live with the consequences of your own free choice.|`|Sofk2yO8aa	Damn, i'm sorry to hear that. I think you should maybe look into getting compensation and taking this to court?|`|ugCaMO3saa	you should kick his ***|`|AA12240972	Whatever makes less stress for you then do it, although I think in the long run you would feel better if you just told him what really happened.  "You took advantage of me and put my physical health in jeapordy.  I will no longer be using your services, please do not contact me in way."  That should do it.  This guy gives all chiropractors a good name.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	not taking it further is a good choice.  however, even if the problem you're having was caused by the chiropractic therapy, doesn't mean he did anything wrong.  i've used them in the past and it is a continuing therapy, if you need it, which i do.  that said, my lil sis has a unreasonable fear of the neck adjustment so it always causes her pain and a few weeks of recovery after an adjustment because she's too tense to 'accept' the adjustment, pulling the muscles and causing spasms.  she still goes to a chiropractor but insists on  not having that particular adjustment, ever. i do my own, all the time.|`|pwgj7tCAaa	sue him!!|`|SLL8jT4faa	yes you should confront him.  I don't know how easy it would be to prove it, but if you haven't been in any accidents since then and there are none on your dmv record you just might be able to get treatment and payment.  definately confront him.  in the least he could tell you what to do to maybe make yourself feel better.|`|I12nj0M7aa	He's obviously afraid to admit he messed up your neck. You should sue him for malpractice.|`|4pYrkOuXaa	Yes and you need to see a doctor something could go wrong|`|fc61a820c63d7c06677681d5406d7929aa	Bingo.  Just quit going.  That is the only way to get away from a chiropractor.  He can bad mouth doctors all he wants but he is one too.  He just proscribes a different kind of medicine.  You will get no where arguing with him about who is best.  It's like arguing over pepsi or coke.  I go to one myself, and they are really teh experts when it comes to spinal allignment, but in my opinion, anywhere outside of that realm you are better off with physical therapy.  You will see teh muscles in your neck reagin form and function, and should be fine.
1EBn5A6daa	no they are probably from pressure points on your back when you are on the bench lift, try placing a small pillow under your shoulder blade area whenever lifting weights, if this doesn't help them to improve or go away then maybe it is the protein shakes but i highly doubt it since it is such a localized spot...good luck on beefing up

If you said stomach exercises you are going to be surprised.<br>  <br>  Doing cardio exercises is probably the single most important thing you can do to get a flat stomach.

When you do cardio exercises your body will burn calories and when you burn more calories then you consume you will be losing fat, stomach fat included.<br>  <br>  You can't have a flat stomach if you have a layer of fat covering your stomach muscles. By doing cardio exercises you will burn fat all over your body, reducing the fat covering your stomach, making your stomach muscles show.<br>  <br>  Choose the Best Stomach Exercises to Lose Belly Fat<br>  First you should know that you can't lose fat in just one section of your body, like your stomach. You can't crunch your way to a flat stomach without cardio exercises and a proper diet.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	Sit ups, crunches, push-ups, pull-ups, basically any exercise that doesn't require weights will build lean, "defined" muscles. Remember, AB workouts DO NOT burn fat around your stomach.|`|c1FAWmbraa	Crunches. And theres a type of crunches that i do thats harder and works better, its the same thing just the only difference is that you lay flat on your back and instead of having your knees bent and up you keep them flat on the ground and just do the sit ups laying down. Also you have to do some cardio like jogging on the spot or dancing. And you gotta eat right too.

The symptom of coughing up blood needs to be distinguished from the more general symptom of blood in sputum, where blood may come from other causes than coughing (e.g. nasal bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, etc.). Both coughing blood or blood in sputum are potentially very serious symptoms that need prompt professional medical attention; Suddenly coughing blood or coughing large amounts of blood is a medical emergency. <br>  <br>  Other than that, it could be Bronchitis, Pneumonia or Lung Disorders<br>  I suggest you go for a check-up|`|M3pRAe7Vaa	Usually the symptoms of strep throat include redness on the throat, fever, and extreme sore throat.  Coughing up blood is not a common symptom of strep.  <br>  <br>  There may be something else going on, possibly another kind of infection.  If you are coughing up blood, it is definitely something to be concerned about, please contact your physician.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|Bm9x9ydxaa	You should go to the doctor if you are coughing up blood :[

ft8t98Pnaa	you should try an epidural, or a facet injection.. when did you get your nerve block? if it was within the past week.. it could take a week or two before you start feeling it start to work. some people feel the effects right away some people it takes time. it depends on the person. <br>  <br>  <br>  Why are facet joint injections helpful? <br>  If the joints become painful due to arthritis, injury, or mechanical stress, they can cause pain in various areas. The lumbar facet joints can cause pain in your lower back, hip, buttock, or leg. <br>  <br>  A facet joint injection serves several purposes. First, by placing numbing medicine into the joint, the amount of immediate pain relief you experience will help confirm or deny the joint as a source of your pain. That is, if you obtain complete relief of your main pain while the facet joints are numb, then these joints are likely your pain source. Furthermore, time-release cortisone will be injected into these joints to reduce any presumed inflammation, which can, on many occasions, provide long-term pain relief. <br>  <br>  What is an epidural and why is it helpful?<br>  An epidural injection places anti-inflammatory medicine into the epidural space to decrease inflammation of the nerve roots, hopefully reducing the pain in the back or legs. The epidural injection may help the injury to heal by reducing inflammation. It may provide permanent relief or provide a period of pain relief for several months while the injury/cause of pain is healing. <br>  <br>  its something worth talking to your dr about. Its better than surgery.. with the epidurals you can get a series which is three in a row... spread two weeks apart,

tpnSRZl9aa	By ten months your bones are healed. After the bones heal it is possible to re-break them. I would immediately ice and elevate your foot. Icing will reduce the amount of swelling because it is a vaso constrictor. This will help limit the amount of fluid retention in your foot which is causing your pain. If your condition does not improve within a few days I would highly recommend seeing an Orthopedic Doctor / or Podiatrist.|`|f7GPOxooaa	give it a day or so if its still swollen i recommend you visit your doctor

You can use facial scrub or another home recipe is you use sugar to scrub your pubic and scrotum.

lPc7UEC5aa	I'm guessing weight is in kilograms...<br>  <br>  Yes, you're probably squeezing excessively if the weights are heavy causing shakes.<br>  <br>  No, 30 seconds - a minute is what you want between sets to be effective.<br>  <br>  Bulking requires tearing of muscle... then an off day or two to let them heal, then tearing again.  Proper diet and heavy lifting with fewer sets will bring bulk.  moderately heavy lifting with more sets gets you lean.<br>  <br>  don't worry about pull ups, the proper shoulder and upper body strength is needed for a lot of pull ups, unless you're training to DO a lot of pull ups you'll be fine.|`|Rez6KpoNaa	all that means is oxygen is flowing|`|h9RCLfgWaa	Never lock out ur joints when lifting.

ne0EjucSaa	umm find like a clinic that does it my dentist office only charges $150 per tooth|`|FfHedeQyaa	It depends on what part of the country you live in and how large the cavity is. In the northeast for a small cavity where only one side of the tooth is involved it is around $200. A larger cavity that may touch two or more sides of the tooth is $400-425. See if there is a college in your area that teaches dentistry. You can usually get treated there. Or, you may want to call a dentist and see if you can do a payment plan. Make sure you get it done or you may eventually need a root canal and/or lose the tooth.<br>  Good luck.|`|qixvH0kBaa	possess as much information as you could maybe is one of the options,however it is quite time consuming,here <a href="http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insur...</a>  is the resource i have ever had good experience.|`|S7rc6mp7aa	I paid only $45 for a filling on my teeth because of this great plan I have. www.healthsavings.ourperfectcard.com I signed up online over 5 years ago and they have saved me thousands of dollars since.

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	I have OCD and I'm working on my bio-psych doctorate, while this could be OCD it could also be OCPD or something else. OCD is characterized by obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts. You are describing intrusive thoughts, they come about because the individual's mind is racing so they think countless things subconsciously but the ones that cause the most distress are the ones which are paid attention to more. People are stimulus based, so if you think ten thousand things then you'll remember the thoughts which provide the most stimulation whether the stimulation is caused by fear, disgust or whatever. The reason why the obsessive thoughts seem to plague many people with OCD is because when someone encounters a stimulating thought that is disturbing they naturally want to not think like that so the focus goes to not thinking something, but you can't not think something it's paradoxical, by thinking something, whether you are trying TO think of something or trying NOT to think of something, you are still thinking about it and the more times you think about something the more times you will think about it in the future.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if that is incredibly clear, so to put it a different way, thoughts are a creation of the mind so trying to avoid thoughts is like mentally running away from them. The more time you spend with disturbing thoughts the more times they will occur in the future, whether you are focusing on them or running away from them they are still active in your mind. These thoughts you described are perfectly normal, everyone has them, they don't mean anything.<br>  <br>  What makes true OCD is when people obsess over trying not to think things so they begin to distract their mind with rituals like hand-washing, light switch flicking or anything to distract a person. I don't have compulsions or rituals, but I do waste time on obsessions so I have what is called Pure Obsessional-OCD. This may be the case with you as well since you didn't mention any rituals or strange actions.<br>  <br>  The important thing is that you don't focus too much on thoughts, allow thoughts to enter your mind and leave your mind without feeling that you have to act on them or that they mean a certain thing, many times thoughts are just combinations of random unrelated concepts. This is why violence in the media affects everyone, because the more times you see people get killed in movies or whatnot, the more violent concepts are put into your mind. For example, a Christian man with OCD might be going about his normal life but since he watched all of the Saw movies he has many violent concepts in his mind, so if he happens to think of one of them at the same time that he thinks of a religious figure like Christ then he may combine the two images and feel tremendous distress. In his mind it's as if he we were killing Christ or torturing him or whatever those lame voyeuristic movies are about.|`|wwdllMzYaa	im not sure what these thoughts have to do with your ocd<br>  is your ocd related to death? family?<br>  <br>  if you and your mum and having problems, you need to talk to someone about it, either her, or another family member you trust<br>  <br>  i dont think you dont loveher,i think your having some emotional isues that you havent been dealing with<br>  have you seen a doctor?<br>  i think you really should<br>  you really need to talk tosoemone<br>  <br>  this doesnt sound like ocd, it sounds like some from of depression, or emotional issues|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	What you write does not bring OCD to mind.  It also does not mean that you don't love your mom or your family.  It has more to do with you feeling alienated in some way.  It suggests some serious unresolved feelings and issues that are not necessarily ALL about your mom and you.  And finally, it sounds troubling enough that you really should get in some counseling situation in which you can be honest and somewhat comfortable.  You may need to try more than one counselor before you achieve that, but persevere!  You'll feel much safer!|`|4Zj2Ljwlaa	Sweetheart that's NOT ocd.<br>  <br>  What you need is a change of rhythm. <br>  <br>  Do something you always wanted to do, if you can in a different environment.<br>  <br>  Buy and eat fruit you haven't had yet. <br>  <br>  If you have things you like then hang on to them if you can.<br>  <br>  Children need to dissociate themselves from their parents. doesn't mean you don't love them, it just means you're becoming your own person.<br>  <br>  If you can don't let anybody step on you finding yourself. Hopefully people in your immediate circle don't have mental health issues. That can be like having prisoners or criminals for family, like heavy
yKgABCxUaa	Usually its not good to go without AF for 3 months.  That would be the point i would go to the Dr.  I had the symptoms you have, also with the negative HPT.  My dr told me it was due to the fact that my body was trying to have my period, having all the symptoms without the actual bleeding.  I am now on BC to regulate my period because with out it, i wouldn't have one.<br>  <br>  Also on a side note....they say that if you go with out your period for longer than 3 months, that lining stays in your uterus and can lead to types of uterine cancer later on.....|`|smGdv04paa	I'd say go talk to your doctor now. It's better that you go sooner rather than later - if it's serious, you can get help, if it's not, at least you'll know.<br>  Also, by AF do you mean Aunt Flo?
WMrNa3Doaa	I did, when I was a teenager.<br>  <br>  Mostly just talking to the therapist.  It's better than talking to a friend or relative because you know the therapist is not judging you in any way, so you can be completely honest.  They also tend to have more insight into why you might be experiencing certain feelings.  They can give you unbiased advice on what to do, and maybe even suggest some projects you can work on.  I also had a group therapy where everyone shared a little bit and there was a bit of role-playing.  Like, I always had issues with my dad, so someone would act like my dad, and I could tell them what I really thought of him and what was on my mind.<br>  <br>  I do feel that this helped. I didn't realize it then, but in hindsight it was a life saver. Literally.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	There are many kinds of Therapy. Two of the most common are Psychoanalytic Therapy, and Cognitive Therapy. Both have their benefits, no matter what therapy you are thinking of starting most likely you will be spending an hour speaking with someone about your life, things that bother you, and ways you can change yourself.  If you have a diagnosed mental illness you really should consider Psychoanalytic Therapy, this kind of therapy is one of the most well-known treatment modalities, and was Founded by Sigmund Freud. Psychoanalytic therapists generally spend time listening to patients talk about their lives, which is why this method is often referred to as "talk therapy." The therapy provider will look for patterns or significant events that may play a role in the client’s current difficulties<br>  <br>  I am diagnosed with PTSD and went to see a therapist i've been with her for the last 8 years and it has been a blessing. She is a Religious Counselor and has adopted a Psychoanalytical style. It's been alot of help. <br>  <br>  If you do not have a diagnosed Mental Illness or have been the victim of a tramatic event you may want to consider Cognitive Therapy. Cognitive therapists tend to focus on specific problems. These therapists believe that irrational thinking or faulty perceptions cause dysfunctions. A cognitive therapist may work with a client to change thought patterns. This type of therapy is often effective for clients suffering from very mild depression, or have had social issues in the past.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	i went through therapy and it was very helpful. id say if you are in therapy and it isnt working for you, find a different therapist. i was in group therapy, and we talked about common problems we have and the therapist was able to help us figure ourselves out, and being in there with ppl that have symptoms in common with you helps remind you that you are not alone.|`|AztCTaQlaa	I have... a year ago... it was nice to get out of the house but I don't think it helped me... neither did the drugs they had me try.. they just made me tired all day and so I sat around being depressed AND tired.

Z2YgGifCaa	During most appointments it is simply talking things over unless they want a sample, which of course is something you will collect at home.<br>  <br>  If they do anything, they may schedule you for a upper or lower GI, Colonoscopy, etc. All of which I have had and they're not as bad as they sound. Mostly the exams are embarrassing and a little uncomfortable. But you can find information on those on-line, just remember they're not as bad as they sound!<br>  <br>  So try to relax because chances are that nothing will happen during an office call as most tests have to be scheduled through a hospital anyway, at least that's how it was for me.<br>  <br>  If you end up having to have one of the above, please feel free to contact me and I'll be more than happy to give you more information in private. In the meantime just relax because it's better to go through all of this now and catch any problems early when they can still be fixed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!|`|pUvEmPrCaa	I have Crohn's disease, so I see a gastroenterologist regularly.  They're going to send you to a lab and order some blood tests so they can test for a bunch of different diseases and conditions and just rule out the things you don't have.  They're going to feel your stomach and check for tumors and obstructions and things like that.  They're going to talk to you really in depth about your symptoms.  Depending on what your symptoms are and what they think is wrong with you, they will schedule testing and/or put you on medication.<br>  <br>  There are no shots and they don't do any tests on the day you see them.  They are always scheduled at a later date and usually not done in the office.  You will probably get a sonogram of the stomach, which is like what women get when they are pregnant, except they're looking at your stomach and not your unborn baby.  You might have to get a barium x-ray, which is where you drink barium and they take pictures of it as it goes through your digestive system.  <br>  <br>  The more serious tests are the endoscopy, which is where they stick a camera tube down your throat and take pictures of your stomach.  They make take some tissue samples to test.  However, you can be put to sleep and it's a painless procedure.  You won't feel or remember a thing.  The colonoscopy is the same kind of test, except they go in through the anus.  They take pictures and tissue samples.  You can also be put to sleep and don't feel or remember a thing.  The sigmoidoscopy is like a colonoscopy that you are awake for.  It is slightly uncomfortable.  They go a few inches up the anus with a camera and take pictures and maybe samples to test.<br>  <br>  But there is no surgery or anything invasive unless you develop or have a condition.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	It's a first consultation, you will probably just talk about your symptoms, medications, that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  He'll probably do a brief physical exam, but nothing in depth. He might feel your abdomen to see if it has any tenderness or hard spots.<br>  <br>  Other than that, he'll schedule any additional lab work or diagnostic procedures that he thinks are necessary.|`|oojO4WAraa	They will talk to you and ask questions.  They may want a stool sample - which you can "collect" at home and return to the office.  I don't think they will even look at your butt - that is what most people worry about.  Gastro doctors and their staff are very understanding that this is a sensitive and embarrassing issue for most people.  Don't worry - and good luck.

pUvEmPrCaa	If your boyfriend can't respect you and treat you how you want to be treated during sex (especially when it's your first time) than he is not the guy for you.  He is a jerk and you shouldn't have to put up with that.  There are tons of guys out there that will happily do it missionary and do whatever you want to make you happy and comfortable.  That should be his number one concern.<br>  <br>  It's not up to your boyfriend whether he wants to take away your virginity or not.  It's your decision.  You decide who you want to lose it to and when you want to lose it.  But I feel like if you lose it to him, you're going to regret it later.  He's not the kind of guy I want would want to give the beautiful gift of virginity to.|`|Z2YgGifCaa	In my opinion he doesn't really care about you, he just wants sex. Plus there is a huge difference in a toy versus the actual act, so don't fall for that either.<br>  <br>  If your uncomfortable, don't do it and don't let him pressure you into it either. IF he truly cares about you, he will care enough to wait until YOU are ready.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!|`|vj93MNjBaa	No offense, but this guy sounds like a jerk.

M3pRAe7Vaa	I suppose I'd sit her down and ask her about her reasoning behind her food diary.  Obviously, it seems as if she is trying to lose weight by skipping all meals besides dinner, and getting her junk food in at that meal.<br>  <br>  If her goal is to lose weight, this would be my plan:<br>  I'd add up the calories she consumed at dinner, and show her how that isn't going to help lose weight, and help her create a healthy eating plan based on 3 meals and a snack, that allow her a cookie or so, so she can get her sugar fix.<br>  <br>  Show her the calorie comparison between her dinner and an entire day's worth of healthy eating, and how much MORE she can eat by eating 3 meals, and by eating healthier foods.<br>  <br>  Again, this is based on the assumption she is trying to lose weight.  I'm only guessing based on the fact that she skipped all meals except dinner, and then ate junk.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|1L7goFOEaa	omg holy s**t that is a lot of fricken food what a big girl i would kill myself if i was her

This is because your Immune system has fought off the infection once, and has learned how to beat it.  Your memory cells are now equipped to take it out and as soon as it enters your body again they will do so!  Why I say usually not is because in the case of a high mutation rate virus this isn't always true, For example we can't just immunize people from HIV because it mutates so rapidly that it would be impossible for our bodies to recognize the virus from memory cells.  Hope this helps and is not too complicated to understand, I'm a bio major and have lost contact with non-major vocab.<br>  <br>  If you are feeling sick, the reason is probably because you and the nurse/receptionist did not have the same thing and she gave it to you.  I wouldn't stress about it though you will be ok!  BTW don't ever take an antibiotic for a viral infection, it won't do anything and your contributing to the antibiotic resistance problem that we are seeing with MRSA.  Know the difference between and Antibiotic and Antiviral (usually you will not get prescribed and antiviral so ask)|`|T1Si1yvlaa	It is possible. Go see your doctor. Drink lots of fluids, and consume vitamin C.
dFHsAXDMaa	Well as a nurse I will tell you it is possible for her to be carrying the yeast infection but have it be kind of  say dormant in her.... if it is a yeast infection you would be extremely itching like wanna rip your penis off itchy.... seeing how she is pregnant I would tell you to go to your doctors have a swab test done and find out for sure because you do not want to give her something that could affect the fetus okay..... not saying it is an std but could be some sort of infection.....better save than sorry
YCXxP43Laa	Tylenol is more likely to damage the liver... in fact the abuse of this does cause many fatalities. Taking the amount you were taking would almost certainly have caused some liver damage. The amount you were taking far exceeds the safe dose, and just taking 25-20 pills ONCE would have caused a problem.<br>  You need to see a doctor urgently!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	everyone is different on how their bodies react to medications. 15-20 pills a day of tylenol pm is alot. im pretty sure that you may have had an underlying condition and when you took the tylenol it made it worse. it is very serious. you are now probably having kidney failure. Which means you would have to go onto dialysis. if you dont get this then eventually you may die. Your kidneys help filter out some the bad stuff in your body. and when you abuse them they fail to work. i wish you all the luck.
rhHgrohdaa	You really need to see a doctor. If money is a problem, then please get to a free clinic, or planned parenthood. In my own opinion, you have cyst on your ovaries, and you do not want them twisting or busting. That is dangerous. It could just be something simple. But it needs to be checked out. Hope you get to feeling better.
525m5qrTaa	It would be simple to say "take it easy" and you belittle medications while you are in denial...  Drinking to adapt social environments is a maladaptive behavior - in other words "YOU are turning yourself into an alcoholic", but still "your are not a fan of anti-depressants" - 5 to 6 shots of plain wrap vodka out of a bag just before an interview will steady you...<br>  <br>  You need to be sensible and practical; while in this present economic situation, you need to be smart...  If you read the paper or internet, notice the increase in Murder or Suicide, people are freaking out...<br>  <br>  One little yahoo answer is not going to resolve the life time issue that you have built up...  Get up off your donkey and push yourself to be better than that!!!|`|7x9lvbhAaa	st john wort you can find it in anystore that sell meds it over the counter it should help with the depression google it for more info you can find at store like wal-greens,wal-mart,cvs,etc|`|V2fyYSXQaa	i am exactly like that.<br>  & im in counseling.<br>  you should try that. go and talk to some one professionally <br>  i know its expensive, but its worth it.<br>  they can give you steps in helping you become less anxious.<br>  you should really think about it.<br>  oh, and it doesn't mean your crazy.<br>  you just have anxiety.
5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	As you eluded to, one of the most common things for this to be is a sciatic type condition.  <br>  <br>  Please clarify as to what you did in "regular" PT...the approach to treatment is highly variable, so it will be interesting to know what constitutes "regular" PT (ie, what treatments did you receive/exercises did you do?)<br>  <br>  One of the best ways to rule this in or out is to see a physical therapist who is certified in mechanical diagnosis and therapy. (Go to www.mckenziemdt.org ). It should be known within a few visits if this is really going to help.  <br>  <br>  BTW...I'm curious to know what you thought of ASTYM. How was it REALLY?|`|IuGTgck2aa	A steroid shot will only mask the pain for a little while, if even that. It won't actually fix anything. Also, after about 3 injections in the same spot, it will actually start killing the tissue. How long did you see the Chiropractor for? Chiropractic treatment isn't a quick fix and you should give it at least 4-6 weeks. Try it coupled with massage and it may help, but you need to give it time.
oi0eamukaa	Hi<br>  My dad lost over 50 pounds. I have a friend who did as well. It took a few months and a lot of dedication. The program is simple to follow if not always easy. If you are ready to try it, it can give great results!<br>  <br>  I lost over 20 lbs using it. And now I just do a maintenance program. I really like it.<br>  <br>  Please feel free to contact me if you have further questions. :)|`|Q0sFkasuaa	The key for losing those unwanted pounds is simple - eat less food and workout more often - the issues appear when we actually try to put that into practice! There are loads of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?! The sole thing which really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away 20 pounds, it really does produce results!
fTztIC22aa	Well, I've recently helped a mother with the same problem. if you're trying to lose weight the best cardio I can suggest is HIIT (high intensity interval training). It only lasts about 20 mins and you do it every other day so that sounds like it's the best solution for you. If you'd like the complete run down on how HIIT works and a regimen email me or yahoo instant message me.|`|AA11318212	I barely have to exercise myself so what I do is:<br>  <br>  I lift things instead of pushing or pulling them (like chairs, when I sweep or vacuum beneath them)<br>  I walk to where I have to go to if its just about two or three blocks away. If I'm carrying around two bags of groceries home, that counts as additional lifting for me.<br>  If I'm going up 4-5 floors, I take the stairs. <br>  <br>  According to my trainer-friend, do as much as you can with out over exerting your muscles and stretch and take water in between. <br>  <br>  I also jog on Sundays, for about 3 hours.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you need more of a workout, try doing the 30min turbo jam workout video, I've tried it and done it on days when I can't jog or go for a walk, its great.|`|CYCIlR7Eaa	Hi Jessica,<br>  <br>  It's hard enough for people to find the time so there's no problem in doing what you are doing. Even going out for a walk with the baby in a buggy is good exercise. Remember this is exersise as well. You might get board having to stick to the same routine so vary it with walks.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|wIpkGuRhaa	it can be just as u good but you need to make sure you are hitting your target heart rate all 3 times and since you are a mother i am sure you are always moving so if you hit your cardio heart rate and then go clean the house then hit it again then go to the park w your son then hit it again you will constiently be burning more calories because you are still burning calories from your workout and you are still moving so its like 2 times the calories|`|AA10241450	It's probably better to do the workout for an hour since it works more on your stamina however since your limited to your workouts it's fine.  Probably better to do 30 minutes and 30 minutes if you can work it in your schedule.  <br>  <br>  If you do go shorter speed up your intensity of the workout! Good luck!|`|BZMPax7Naa	Regardless of whichever way is better.  You are doing what you can and that is what's important
115Q6JYZaa	I am a nail tech and studied the medical field of it so let me tell you....NO...NO...NO...  This is a child and her nail bed is still growing.  First of all if the drill was used on the natural nail that is bad.  That should never be done with kids or adults.  If you need to email me and I will explain just how to take them off without hurting your daughter that will be just fine but they do need to come off ASAP.  There is many things that can go wrong and if it was done in an unclean salon then she could get a fungus and at her age it will take a while to get ride of it.  The nail tech that put on the nail on the LITTLE GIRL should rethink what he/she is doing and I really think they don't care.  Make sure she does not ripe one off cause that could take her nailbed off!|`|G2w8Dgtsaa	my god that is terrible, how dare she do that without your permission?? i would be so furious!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautytech.info/articles/nailrisks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautytech.info/articles/nail...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/acrylic-nails/AN01261" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/acrylic...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nails.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nail...</a>
I8lFqyyFaa	I don't know about the cramps, but the 3 week period is normal, initially anyway.  Most women will stop menstruating entirely on depo, but irregular bleeding is still possible.  On my first cycle of depo, I spotted the whole three months, but after that I never had a period again until almost a year after I stopped it.  That's apparently a typical experience with the drug I've found after consulting with other women who have used it.  See if your current side effects aren't gone with the next injection.|`|HHyny0JSaa	The depo shot doesn't work for everyone. I took it for 9 months and spot or bled almost the whole time. If this is your first shot then your body may be adjusting to it and you will probably experience some break through bleeding. Its common with the shot. Either give it some time or you may want to look into an alternative form of birth control such as the pill, patch, nuva ring or an IUD|`|4vdINuv6aa	Boy.. <br>  Yea, I have taken the shot one time and I never got it again. I had my peiord for two weeks straight and I had two peiords when I got the shot and both of them were two weeks straight. After my peiords, I had brown discharge then it turned black. I also had bad cramps. It's just because you're getting use to it. But, that scared me bad enough and never went back to get that shot.
xmibEEdcaa	Oh, ow.  Sounds like you pinched a nerve in your neck. That can be really painful.<br>  <br>  You've been doing all the right things for it, but sadly, sometimes that's just not enough. If the pain becomes truly unbearable, ask someone to take you to an urgent care unit or ER. They can give you a stronger pain killer or a muscle relaxant, which might be all you need for it to start to get better. Sometimes just getting some relief from the pain and tension for a short time is all it takes for your body to start to heal itself.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Maybe you got something out of alignment?  If it doesn't improve I'd suggest either a doctor or a chiropractor.  I hope you feel better soon.  The naproxen is good but, if not improved you may need a muscle relaxer which only a doctor can perscribe.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dHcP602caa	Take an ibuprofen with some water, it might numb the pain a little bit. <br>  Was it a sudden pain, as if you popped your jaw? Sometimes that happens to me and it really hurts my neck.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped, and I hope you get better. :)|`|i4so2FqMaa	sounds like a pinched nerve see the school nurse also in the mean time a finger message might just work if stays with u see a doc the last thing u want is a pain full head ache
I8lFqyyFaa	One blunt a month ago isn't going to show up on a drug test.  The only things that show up are chronic use that maybe you've taken a couple weeks off of, or a single use that just happened.|`|gktVbcEnaa	Absolutely. I would bet money that you will be clean. Just stay well hydrated and dont sweat it.|`|J1i9GDGiaa	yeah dude your good jus drink more water than usual jus b/c if you fail the test with your recruiter he'll help you out, depending on your branch [i doubt the air force would] but thats why you have a "pre piss test" yoyu'll be good dude jus dont smoke anymore hell if you work out a lil you can sweat that **** out lol

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  These exercises much more effective then push ups or sit ups:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|hOvQLaEQaa	Hi there xiiskell!<br>  <br>  There are heaps of ideologies on how to get good abs and exercises are hard to show in words but for general things to go by I did some research and found this article for you by Mike Darwin;<br>  <br>  "It all comes down to calories. Remember that it takes 3500 calories to burn a pound of fat. Take 3500 more than what your body needs and your body stores it as fat. So, you <br>  need to cut down on your daily calorie intake, pump up that protein, stay away from foods with highly refined sugar and saturated fat, fiber up your diet, and drink lots of <br>  water. Couple these with lots of cardio exercises and in the end, lose the fat, shed those pounds, and reveal the tight, tight muscles underneath.<br>  <br>  After you have trimmed down that excess fat, you can now concentrate on building up the perfect six pack. There are a lot of abdominal training exercises that would do wonders <br>  for your would-be abs - crunches, reverse crunches, knee raises, side leg raises, side crunches, back extensions, the works. Working on your abs two to four days a week, every <br>  other day, doing four to five sets per sessions, and ten to twelve repetitions per set would definitely be a great start.<br>  <br>  Through it all, though, you should not be expecting too much too soon. You just simply cannot spot reduce that belly flab or any other part of your body, for the matter. <br>  A week or a month's worth of exercise may not even yield tangible results, and if it did, there is still no assurance that you will be losing exactly what you wanted to lose <br>  in the first place. But you should not be too hard on yourself nor should you resort to pushing yourself even harder or worse, to the point of starvation.<br>  <br>  Abdominal training, point blank, is hard and it requires a lot of imagination. But when you get comfortable with the routine, training your abs would become next to instinctive.<br>   So, just keep at it. With a little perseverance and a little more attention to detail, you will well be on your way to getting those tight, killer abs that could definitely <br>  turn heads around to a full 360 degrees. You are sure to get ripped abs fast!"<br>  <br>  Also if you check the sources box at the bottom here there is a great course for you to check which has some free manual which could help you out.<br>  <br>  Keep up the hard work champ, you'll get there.|`|hFfcf6Szaa	You can't burn fat in certain spots, but you can burn it all over by doing cardio.  Ab exercises will help define your muscles, but if there is a layer of fat over those muscles, no one will be able to see them.  Running, biking, swimming, walking, rowing, playing sports are all good cardio exercises, mix it up and use resistance to burn the most calories.  Eat healthy foods and stay away from salt and soda that can make you feel and look bloated.|`|fTztIC22aa	Yeah, it's called cardio. You need to eat about 6 small low calorie meals a day and do proper cardio and also anaerobic exercises and this will help you get the weight off while building up your ab muscles and other muscles so you don't look puny.
