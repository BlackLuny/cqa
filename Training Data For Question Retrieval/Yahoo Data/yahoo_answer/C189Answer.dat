e5CuEiPfaa	I walked to help me dilate, and I was still overdue! They had to end up inducing me. I hope its different for you, but for me it didn't work! Good luck and Congrats!|`|a98nJlnEaa	my dr told me when i get to 35 weeks i should walk for an hour a day.. i probably wont because walking for 10 minutes already gives me pain..|`|28QPS6V9aa	I started walking about a month before my due date and I walked about a mile, two days a week. It was 95 degrees outside so I really couldn't walk too much. Gosh, I still remember the awful swollen ankles I got from those walks! They seemed to do the trick though because I had my daughter at 39 weeks. When I was in labor I walked almost the entire time around the hospital. It really didn't help much since I was in labor for 28 hours, but it sure was better then being stuck in bed!|`|AEXJcpmHaa	I walked everyday about a month before my due date and it didnt help anything BUT when i started having contactions every ten min for several hours once they slowed down i went on a mile walk.....i gave birth to my daughter about 12 hours after my walk....i dont know if it helps dialtion but its good to bring the baby down into your pelvos and it keeps labor going once its started and gets you going into "actice" labor sooner.......congrats and hope your delivery is smooth and great! My birthing exp went very smoothly and maybe all the walking helped me out with that too i dont know though....
e98eb6bfbd976f30fe5455f0fb6ae9d8aa	How far along are you?  And yes - it can be perfectly normal to have colostrum (pre-milk!) coming out of your nipples whilst pregnant.  Try not to stimulate them.  You can buy disposable breast pads if there is a lot coming out to protect your clothes.<br>  <br>  If the fluid is foul smelling or strange colored I would call your Dr to make sure you dont have some kind of infection.<br>  <br>  P.s. None of my business but you should probably think about how to tell your folks,,, guess they are going to find out at some point and you might benefit from their support in the meantime!|`|kprKXEOSaa	It's called colostrum.  Your milk doesn't come in until a couple days after the baby is born.  It's totally normal.|`|KH6HAZdBaa	you'd better be telling your parents.|`|XpLufXKFaa	It is colostrum (google it). You will be leaking up until you give birth. You need to buy a breastfeeding bra (without an underwire) and breast pads to avoid unwanted messes. <br>  <br>  You need to tell your parents. They are going to find out sooner or later. If you are mature enough to get youself into this situation you need to be responsible enough to deal with the consequences. I know you don't want to hear that, but you really need too.|`|w9jx0JYLaa	Yes it is normal for them to discharge, it can happen anytime in pregnancy, although some people dont experience it at all.|`|mvVDeL5uaa	the white stuff comeing out of your nipples is probably milk
eNj4bbKBaa	i started showing at about 4 months and i have a pretty average weight and figure. it was mostly just feeling bloated and looking chubby around the middle. sometimes if you are very thin around the middle you can show super early. congratulations!!! i'm happy for you and your new baby :)|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i started showing around 16 weeks...<br>  i was too small to fit into maternity clothes but too big for my own clothing.<br>  <br>  just go up a few sizes until you fit into maternity clothing|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes, i can relate!!  I am almost 14 weeks and showing already.|`|YuA7a08Maa	I was showing by 15 weeks and this is my first child.  I'm incredibly short (5'2'') with a small torso.  There were some people that thought I was showing a little at 8 weeks.  Now I'm 20 weeks and strangers notice.  It's different for every woman and every body type.  I notice on the weekend when I eat less and rest more that I am showing less.  I think a lot of it is bloating instead of baby at that stage.  I would bloat in the evening every day for several weeks before I really started sticking out...everybody said I looked huge when I saw them at night.  Good luck!|`|98WKYtfwaa	I started showing at 14weeks.
caM1Syyfaa	I think your question is legitimate. I am also surprised about how much work being a full-time mom is. Before I got pregnant I thought the house-wives of my male colleagues were just lazy. Now I am on maternity leave, trying to learn for some extra qualification too, which I can only do in the night, when the baby is sleeping (and I have only 1 child, not 3).<br>  <br>  I think the best thing to do it guilt management. Try to forget about all that list of priorities once in a while, and make an appointment for yourself to do whatever you want to do: dine out with hubbie, go for a pedicure, read a fiction book etc. And stick to it, despite all the other priority tasks not being fulfilled yet.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Don't worry they grow before you know and then their gone. You will make it through and you won't even remember how hard or crazy it was. Just keep in mind their only at these ages once so enjoy them. The rest will work itself out.|`|DdLfaEzNaa	It is very hard, I was thinking these same thoughts just the other day.  I think one reason that it is harder is that you are 100% responsible for the well-being of your child, whereas if you are the baby-sitter, even an older sibling, that weight of the responsibility rested on the shoulders of the parents, not on you.  You didn't have to make sure they grew up okay, you only had to take care of them for short periods at a time and didn't have to provide the basic necessities of life for them.  <br>  <br>  It is hard, but keep plugging away at it and they'll be okay (and so will you).  Try to take those times when they are napping or away and do something that will bring you a little relaxation--some old hobby you enjoyed before having kids or trying something new.  <br>  <br>  Remember, too, that they will grow up way too fast.  I love that my oldest is now school age because he's experiencing all sorts of great new things, but I miss him curling up with me on the couch to cuddle with me just because he wanted to be close.  Those moments are rare with him now, but I cherish them with my younger ones.|`|oiJITSNZaa	You must remember is life all about you or others? Kids sense when they are a "bother" and thus behave even worse. Life isn't all about me. Grow up and your kids will too! You must learn contentment in every stage of life or you'll never get anything out of life! You prob couldn't wait to get married and have kids now you can't wait till they grow up, next you won't be able to wait till they leave teen yrs and settle down, then you'll look back and wish they didn't grow so fast. Contentment my friend is the answer!|`|T7nLDjlEaa	that's God way of saying Ha, should of used a condom!
QRXtkYrzaa	Well, the official stat is that when everything is perfect, you only have a 30% chance of conceiving each month.  I tend to think that's kind of an unrealistic stat seeing as how easily teenagers or people not even trying to get pregnant get pregnant after having sex only a few times or so.  <br>  <br>  This is the end of my first month TTC. I am due for AF on Tuesday so maybe I'll update you if something happens!|`|o1yy6KABaa	It can depend on alot of things- ie age, if you were on the pill, how long you were on it for, theres alot of reasons.<br>  We have been TTC for 8 months now, I was on the pill from a teenager(bad periods) until last year, it actually took 3 months for the pill to get out of my system and have my cycles return to how they used to be before I went on the pill. <br>  My doc told be that 75% of women get pregnant within the first three months off coming off BC, around 10% pregnant within 6 months and the other small percent take closer to 12 months.|`|9jSmmIxfaa	I got pregnant my first time trying, but its really a luck of the draw. If this wasnt your month you weren't meant to have a november baby, mabey your meant to have a december baby!! Keep on trying it will happen when its meant to. I promis =)<br>  Baby Dust to You!|`|0hQkcDhjaa	Hi there. Not to worry. Most women will conceive within six months, and it's not considered a potential problem until you've been trying for more than a year. Here are the stats from the NHS (unfortunately it doesn't give stats for months 2-5):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Infertility/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Infertility...</a><br>  <br>  I know exactly how you feel though! I just started taking fertility meds and haven't had any luck yet. It's been three months for me, too. Good luck to you, and don't be discouraged!
49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	Usually the mother gets custody more often except in cases of where it would not be in the best interest of the child to stay with her such as abuse, neglect, she does drugs, etc.  Then the father would most likely get custody.  HE would have to go to court to try to get custody from you though.  Most of the time these days men don't seem to care enough to do that.  Sorry to say it, but it seems to be the way things go these days although my hubby and I got his stepson four years ago after he was abused, neglected etc. from his maternal grandma for that many years... we had just found out how bad it was.  You don't need to worry about this right now, because chances are you would have custody.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You would have to go to court for custody.|`|H2ZMDc4Iaa	I am in he same situation with you. I dont have any reason to believe my boyfriend and I will be seperated, but im still concerned the baby could be taken from me in that situation.<br>  <br>  From what i understand a court almost always sides with the mother, but in some cases where the mother for whatever reason seems to be "unfit" and the father the better parent, he will be given custody. Alot of it depends on personal circumstances.|`|MRV9rNyjaa	legally neither of you would have custody of the baby until you go to court. but however most of the times the mom will keep the kid until they go to court. i hope nothing like that happens to you, it can put so much stress on the child. and if it does, please please be nice to each other if not for your sake do it for your baby boy!|`|EJl2RvDfaa	unless you are proven unfit yes the baby will stay with you|`|AA11542929	u dont put him on the birth certificate then ur ok..|`|azE51WGRaa	You would have to go to court for custody but unless he was deemed unfit, it would probably be joint (equally shared) custody. This man is the father of your baby forever and even if things go sour between you two, I would hope you wouldn't let it affect your son's relationship with his father.|`|kbrW9hSRaa	yes hun u get your baby why wouldn't u the baby is always with the mom unless the dad try to get the baby by saying u r unfit.|`|Xj13LFL3aa	you would have to go to court <br>  and they will decide who is best <br>  fit for the child
6bSIAne3aa	Well... I think so...<br>  <br>  I had toxemia during pregnancy and my daughter had toxemia during her pregnancy.|`|NopTr18taa	not always, but there is a chance.. I didn't have the same sort of pregnancy as my mother at all.. I was the one ill the entire time, she never had a day of illness..
kaqPSgTVaa	She's right. They go by the date of the last period NOT by conception date. The date she gave you was that not hte date of conception.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	your due date goes by the first day of you last menstrual period. if your last menstrual period was 10 weeks ago then you are 10 weeks.
TC21ao0Paa	Sometimes the Piticon does not work in the labor process, in other words, it fails to increase your dilation of your cervix and/or stimulate your bag of waters to break. Pitocin will cause cramping because it will increase the strength of your contractions.<br>  <br>   I had this problem with my first pregnancy and, I should of opted for the C-Section.<br>  <br>  Have you felt a warm fluid leaking sensation ? Not all women will have the " gush " of fluid indicating that their bag of waters have broken.<br>  <br>  I would recommend going to the hospital based on your present symptoms.Your Doc can take it from there. If he/she suggests breaking your bag of waters, then I think that you should take their advice. In breaking your bag of waters, it should " get things going ".<br>  Again, let your Doc take it from there.<br>  I have had 2 pregnancies, the first was a vaginal delivery ( which I decided not to have a C-Section). My second pregnancy, with a breech position baby, and, my Doc tried to turn her around but, I <br>  ending up with a C- Section.<br>   Due to my own personal experience, I'd take a C-Section any day over a vaginal delivery. <br>  <br>  I hope that this helped and Congrats !!|`|AA11908398	Yes, you could still go into labor.  I would just call the oncall doctor and explain how you are feeling to see if they feel you need to go back.  I have heard many stories of people being sent home and then going into labor.  Call the dr.  I have been induced with all my pregancies, and it takes time.  I wasn't necessarily showing any progress for the first few hours, but after the three jells, I started to slightly contranct and then they started the pitocin, and that began the contractions.  Did you get jelled?  if you have any questions you can email me and I will try to help you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	I have heard of that happening once sent home. Sure, you could go into labor tonight. Just keep monitoring your contractions and how far apart they are. You never know. I was induced, too, but stayed in the hospital. How long were you there? It probably took me a good 10-13 hours before I even started feeling any contractions at all. It took much longer than I expected.
9wqmJMx0aa	Our son is not big on the sweets.  At his 1st birthday, he just stared at his cake and maybe dipped his finger in for a small taste.  No big messy cakeface picture for us.  But that's not anything to worry about.  We have tons of other pictures to celebrate the day :)<br>  <br>  Don't push a food on him that he just may not find appealing right now.  Sweets can be really overpowering for a baby.  If he loves cheerios as you mentioned, perhaps place them on the cake directly to at least get him interested in the cake.|`|4ilM2hCwaa	So he doesn't like cake,  No big deal - may be a good thing in the long run.  Get him ice cream for his birthday, or pudding, or whatever he likes.  Cake is not mandatory, the cake face picture is not a parental requirement|`|P1xlrvAaaa	You mentioned he has tactile sensitivities.Does he have any other sensory type issues?My son has sensory issues and also hates cake,but he loves sundae's so we got him a sundae and every one else ate cake.Here are some things you can try with him for his tactile issues.<br>  <br>  1)buy foam soap put it on a mirror or in the bath tub and see if he will play with it.You play with it as well so he will imitate you.Also get some foam letters for the bathtub and put them in there slowly(one at a time) while he is in there.<br>  <br>  2)Start with silly string and work your way up to silly puddy and play dough.This doesn't have to be messy just spray it in one place.<br>  <br>  3)put some foam soap on his hands and allow him to "problem solve" on how to get it off<br>  <br>  My son also doesn't have any pictures with cake on his face.Justfind something he likes Cherrios or not and just let him be happy.Good luck.I hope this helps!!!!|`|M5jF5w5Taa	If the picture is important to you, how about giving him chocolate pudding? Decorate it with whipped cream and sprinkles, etc., and it will look festive enough for the scrapbook.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Definitely don't MAKE your child eat cake just for some pics sake!!

Hf5doDxsaa	The funny part is...<br>  <br>  You posted this question because you presume to be a better mother for breastfeeding your baby.  But, what kind of mother purposely tries to stir up trouble with innocent people on a genuine website.  I'm sure your children are going to grow up to be just like you...YAY!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	actually i was bf and my brother wasnt and of the two of us he was always the healthy one! the first time i ever remember him being sick was when he was about 10 and he got the stomach flu.  i think its rather judgemental to say someone who isnt bf will have a child that isnt healthy or developing optimally. the hardest part of bf for me was that i have very sensitive skin and no amount of lanolin or gel pads would help with the pain. and since we were on wic we did only needed to buy about one can of formula a month for our son so it wasnt such a financial burden. plus i did work at the time and it wasnt going to work for me to pump at my job.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Oh here we go again....<br>  <br>  Does it really matter? Why are you so bothered? At least their children are lucky enough to be fed - think of the millions of children starving out there. There are more important things to be worried about than whether a child is formula fed.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Feeling resentful about having to breastfeed again this evening, Fajina?<br>  <br>  Edited: I resent my mother for a variety of things.  I start fights with her about them (when I've been drinking), not with strangers.<br>  <br>  Edited:  No body is going to be able to answer the question you are really asking, again and again.  It's too personal.  No one here is going to be able to answer "Why did Fajina's mother not care enough to breast feed her, when Fajina hates breastfeeding and resents having to do it, but cares enough about her own daughter to suffer?".<br>  <br>  I usually don't advocate formula, but you dear, should think about coming over to the dark side.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I "gave" in to formula because I stopped producing. Damn that Pituitary gland tumor... Thank God there is formula or my baby would have starved.<br>  <br>  "Actually, Dmg, I feel very resentful towards my mother for not breastfeeding me"<br>  <br>  I'd also be resentful towards her for naming you something that sounds like vagina.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Go away<br>  <br>  EDIT: I think the reason you're trying to stir up trouble is because you feel inadequate as a mother.  You're pretty pathetic.  Instead of acting like a total a s s, why don't you go stick your boob in your kid's mouth?<br>  <br>  EDIT 2:  My daughter is 8 months old and has never been sick.  She is also reaching developmental milestones earlier than most babies.  I guess I can contribute that to FORMULA!!!!!!  Thank you Enfamil!!!!!|`|XkHiFJMKaa	I breast feed my first and she was the sicker of my 2 kids. talked later walked later etc.<br>  the second girl i bottle feed and she was never sick and developed quicker.<br>  <br>  I love both my kids and it dosent matter how they were feed.<br>  get over it|`|AA12034666	When I had my son, I tried breastfeeding. For one whole week I tried it. He just wasn't getting enough to eat. No-way, no-how. He wasn't getting any sleep, and was always hungry. In desperation I pulled out the formula. It worked. He was contented, and slept happily for 4 hours. I sent my husband to the grocery store for a case, and I kept it up. The formula prices weren't all that outrageous. And neither were the medical costs because ours weren't increased in any way. At evey regular Well Visit, he was always progressing normally, was happy and healthy, and was always at the top end of the scale. Had I continued to "fight to overcome" just for the sake of saying "I Breastfed", it would have only caused him physical distress -- and his pediatrician bore that up. <br>  <br>  My son is now 28. He's 6'3", 200 pounds. He's healthy, fit, and in the Air Force. I don't think formula harmed him one iota. <br>  <br>  But dear, you have no right to resent your mother for what you think she should have done. It was a different world when you were born than it is today. When your mother was born it was a different world than when her mother was born. Attitudes change with the era. What's "right" today may not be tomorrow. There was a time when all newly pregnant women were given a particular hormone therapy because it was deemed "a good thing" for the baby's development -- 25 years later 3/4 of their offspring had ovarian cancer. You can't judge -- it's not your place. All you can do is what you think you should do at the time.|`|dgRTkccBaa	What challenge of breastfeeding was hard to overcome? I never produced enough milk for my twins so they were constantly hungry and screaming, and one had latching problems. I was trying to heal from a c-section, I was losing weight rapidly and was barely able to stand up let alone care for my babies properly.  In the end I felt that having a mother who was well rested and healed enough to care for them was more important that being breast fed for my babies.  It was also nice to see them finally getting enough to eat.  Both my kids are happy, healthy and developing normally.  You need to realize that not everyone's situation is the same.  It must be wonderful to live in a world where everything is so black and white.  Your medal is in the mail.<br>  BTW, simply being breast fed does not mean a child will be healthier.  I was born a preemie and could not nurse and was formula fed, my younger sister was breast fed until she was a year old and I've always been healthier than her.  She's got a horrible immune system, a person with a cold just has to look in her direction and she catches it, and I hardly ever get sick.  It's been like that our whole lives.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	ok the part that was too hard for me to over come was that i wasn't producing enough milk to feed my child which in turn made her jaundice worse so it was either keep not feeding my kid enough and let her starve and be sick or keep breastfeeding because if i don't people like you will be on my case. i choose to feed my kid<br>  i DO NOT nor have i EVER had increased medical costs because of formula. once i switched to formula as a matter of fact my daughter stopped seeing the DR so much because she started gaining weight and becoming healthier. as for financial burden  i would PAY ANYTHING to make sure my child is healthy so i don't care if formula is 20 bucks a can if that is what my kid needs to be healthy that is what i will pay. and i KNOW that my child is as healthy as can be for one because she has done EVERY developmental stage early and she is in the 90th percentile for her age. so i couldn't have done THAT bad now could i?<br>  oh and by the way my child is NEVER once been sick except a runny nose during teething. so don't tell me her immune system is bad because that's bull... she's healthier then ANYONE i know!|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	What challenge of breastfeeding was too hard to overcome?  None<br>  <br>  What was so hard that you gave into the financial burden of formula prices and increased medical costs?  I and my husband are intelligent, and earned enough money to buy formula, which by the way did not harm my daughter at all.<br>  <br>  How do you measure the peace of mind of having a healthy baby who is developing optimally? I bet a kid raised by someone like me on formula spends less in therapy bills the a kid forced to suck on your teet, subjected to your inane rantings.<br>  <br>  * Is your life really so lacking that you have to ask so many vapid yet provocative questions to people who you don't have to look at in real life and expose the level of your bad self-confidence?|`|SjX72fPyaa	Wow really? Your at this again??<br>  <br>  Anyways, I switched to formula because my daughter couldn't latch properly no matter how many lactation specialists we saw and she was losing to much weight.<br>  I'm honestly quite happy with my decision to formula feed because now I know exactly how much my daughter is eating. And she is still happy, healthy and exactly where she is supposed to be when it comes to her weight even without the breast milk.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i am still breastfeeding my 14 month old baby <br>  <br>  some dont feel comfortable breastfeeding, <br>  <br>  others want dad to be involved. <br>  <br>  some go back to work and feel it impossible to breastfeed. <br>  <br>  my sister - in - law is a stay at home mom who always complains that they are broke took her baby off the boob at 3 months cuz she said the baby was too hungry and she wanted to go out and drink. <br>  <br>  to women like those i get annoyed because while breastfeeding is not for everyone, formula is EXPENSIVE and breastmilk is free <br>  <br>  Elijah/Kassie/Ellen whoever you are that keeps changing your name from embarrassment !!! you are a leech on our society and a pathetic excuse for a mother. maybe you should spend some of your money on your baby instead of going out and drinking! welfare is for people who need it not for losers like you who take advantage so you can go out and get drunk|`|rAkWoweOaa	Lol. My stepmom took my little sis to the pedi and there were so many sick babies there, and being the busybody that she is, she asked about their feedings and what not, and guess what..... 3 out of 5 of the babies that were sick were BREASTFED! We all know breast is best, but give it a rest already.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i tried so hard to breast feed i did for a week ,he had latching problems . so when i got home he couldn't eat so i had to switch to formula.|`|955YoHvVaa	I think your baby sucked your nipples right up your a-s-s- again tonight. Grow up.|`|mfiA5Hcwaa	All through my pregnancy I didn't want to breastfeed, but I think that there is so much pressure from health care providers nowadays that people like me feel pressured into doing it. I did it for 5 weeks and hated it, the feel of it felt completely wrong, my baby didn't seem to settle as he was never full. After I put him on formula he was much happier and slept through - I don't think people should have to pay for formula as not everyone can breastfeed! My little one is now 8 months old and perfectly healthy, I was happy not breastfeeding so it made me calmer around him.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	What challenge of breastfeeding was too hard to overcome?<br>  My son had a poor sucking reflex and couldn't suck hard enough to feed himself.  <br>  What was so hard that you gave into the financial burden of formula prices and increased medical costs? The thought of my son having to be hospitalized due to weight loss made the cost of formula a mute point.  Also, those hospital costs were avoided by feeding him formula, and he has yet to be sick unlike his breastfed cousin who has been sick for the last month.<br>  How do you measure the peace of mind of having a healthy baby who is developing optimally?  I have peace of mind knowing that I did what is best for my baby and he is developing great.  People are amazed that he is only 3.5 months old.  <br>  <br>  You are an extremely judgemental person and I feel sorry for your children.  They may be physically healthy due to your breastmilk but they are going to ne psychologically messed up having a mother like you.|`|GAMypxIFaa	I think that is sad not to at least try to breast feed I mean that is why we have breast, i had my daughter the Sunday before last and it hurt pretty bad the first week but i dealt with it because it is the very best for her, and was made especially for her. My nips feel fine now and my baby is wonderful. Some moms can't breast feed though for medical reasons and some can't handle the pain, i am proud to say i breast feed and it is so much easier.<br>  <br>  For those of you who would rather get messed up then be a good mom you shouldn't have had children.|`|PwhrTNZraa	I'll answer the actual question and stay away from the drama thanks. <br>  <br>  I did not GIVE IN to formula.  Unfortunately some of us CAN'T/COULDN'T breastfeed, no matter how badly we wanted to do it.  My daughter literally starved for 2 days because I wasn't producing enough milk, I was even given medication to try and help bring my milk in, didn't work.  I would then breastfeed and supplement with formula.  Finally, I started pumping and much to my surprise, I was only producing about 5oz in a WHOLE DAY.  It's not fair to come down on women who use formula instead of breastfeeding, no matter their reasons.  For me, it wasn't a choice I was able to make.  I wanted to breastfeed, but it just wasn't meant to be for us, I shouldn't be made to feel guilty because my body didn't cooperate and I had to use formula.  At least my daughter was well fed.  She's now 3 1/2, ahead of many kids her age (very smart), and she had her first bout of the flu about 3 weeks ago.  Until then, she'd only had about 2 minor colds a year, never had a fever, then she started preschool.  Choosing formula didn't cause any extra medical costs (we live in Canada, we don't have to pay for our medical anyhow), she sees the Dr once a year for a checkup, and she's developing optimally.  Until you know the REAL facts, you need to give your head a shake, and get real.  Not everything in life works out perfect, or as planned.|`|zHG5gjBZaa	Why post such a controvesal question..This subject is painfull for some.<br>  <br>  I had complications in my delivery therefore resulting in being away from my baby for 4 hours and when I tried to breastfeed (as I wanted to breastfeed due to our first son on formula and he was sick as a baby I didnt want that to happen to this baby) and he would  not no matter what we did latch on so the midwife suggested i bottle feed him as he was so hungry.<br>  <br>  We find it hard finaciallybut he is more a priority then us having luxaries such as expensive body wash and the best ever deserts, so we cope and also he has serious silent reflux so it now costs us more. <br>  My baby is developing optimally as he sees a health nurse every week and our family doctor every second week.|`|XXo0uHcbaa	I breast fed my son perfectly until he was 2 weeks old. He was a happy, health, full baby and then all of a sudden my breasts stopped making enough milk for him, so i had to supplement with formula. And guess what?...He's still a happy, healthy and full baby. I still breast feed but i only make about 2 to 3 oz, not enough when you have a baby that takes 4 and 5 oz. in a feeding. It's not always the mother's choosing to go with formula, so chill out.|`|a415a5f9dcd03c53caa40dad1bb3e839aa	I am having a problem with your question being a real question and not being a critical statement.<br>  <br>  I breast fed my daughter for 3 1/2 years.She never had a bottle.  She is healthy as a horse.  I could nurse her cause my husband and I had made a plan.  I stay home to take care, he goes out and works.  Now my daughter is grown and has 2 boys of her own.  She nursed both, but her milk quit around 8 months because she was working 2 jobs and pumping herself, but not getting enough rest.  The babies were nursed and they are also healthy, just like their mother.<br>  <br>  Please understand that not everyone can nurse for whatever reason.  I was the lucky one an did, very successfully.  It takes an entire village to raise a child.  Maybe the young mothers need to hear we are there to help encourage them to nurse and do it successfully and I did and do.  I give free counsel to anyone who asks about breastfeeding.  It is one of the hardest things a young mother can do but well worth the effort.  So please don't be too tough on people that don't or can't.<br>  <br>  My mother did not nurse me either so I have horrible asthma and allergies.  She rationed she was not able because she was too young, that was true.  She did try to nurse my younger brother, but she let her nipples bleed, so she stopped after 2 weeks.  My daughter bleed, but she just put lanolin on and listened to me to put the baby on the other  breast till the bleeding stopped.  The baby was not latching on back into her nipple far enough so he was sucking the end which equals blood.  All better now.  Some women just need some good old education in nursing before they have a baby to know what is all involved.  My child cried, but she did not stop.  My mother had society telling her that a bottle was better then bloody boobs.  I am not scared but she is.  Oh well.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Are you always this rude?  I will still answer your questions though:<br>  1.  When my daughter was born, she latched on correctly, but when she nursed it felt like knives stabbing my breast. i was a first time mom in the hospital dreading feedings.  I even got help from the lacation consultant who encouraged me to try formula.<br>  2.  First of all, I can afford to feed my daughter.  The medical cost is the same as it would be if I were breast feeding.  my daughter is 5 months today and has NEVER been sick. <br>  3.i my daughter is developing normally.  She is in the 50th percentile for height and weight, and is developmentally ahead of most kids her age.|`|aaDQFkhKaa	I breastfed all four of my kids with one exception.  My oldest refused to breast fed at five months. I tried to stick to it but gave in to formula.  Looking back I wish I had tried harder.  I feel that I do not have the same bond with her than with the other three (who were breast fed till at least a yr, the youngest 8 m still breastfeeding). I totally regret it! When will people see that breast feeding is good for you, for your baby, and your pocket book?  If God did not intend us to breast feed our babies we would not have breast!!!!<br>  <br>  I understand that most mother have hardships (ie illnesses and so on) for not breast feeding their babies, but to not bf because you want to go out and drink is very seflish!! You should not have had a baby if you cant take care of it.  I breast feed my kids and paid for my formula, why should I pay for your babies formula because you are still growing up yourself? (for Kate)|`|ibeYAlwpaa	i gave up breast feeding after 4 weeks =)<br>  I feel i made the best decision for my circumstance, and it doesnt even bother me a little bit that people could actually think that i didnt do good enough :)<br>  I believe i have healthy baby, who gets all the nutrients she needs. Her dr also believes that. Whaddya know, babies can be healthy and not be breastfed. :P<br>  <br>  <br>  ** also my baby was born 5 ilbs 11 oz && lost over 1 pound and wasn't gaining ANY weight... and it was a DIRECT result from breast feeding.**<br>  <br>  && im okay with the decision i made<br>  <br>  edit... my daughter has literally never been sick, and shes 15 months... her immune system is working amazingly so far...|`|c73QkZ2haa	When my babies were getting dehydrated and the option of inserting an IV was considered and they were becoming jaundiced and had red pee from Urea crystals(when they did pee which was not at all often) and i still didnt even have colostrum coming in I "gave" in. God you know some people dont make this choice it is forced on them. And how does giving a baby formula result in increased medical costs? Thats BS. My kids are hardly sick. My 6 year old has never even had the flu or the flu shot. My twins are healthy other than the fact that one of them had a hernia or wait was that caused by the formula? pft...|`|z6IekuwSaa	Some women have diseases that do not allow them to breastfeed, Sometimes the babies are born with things that do not allow them to nurse, like retractable lip tongue tied. Some women's' milk actually does not come in. (my hubs says that your stupid and his advice is to read a f-in book). I tend to agree|`|8U0Wtop2aa	My daughter liked to breastfeed constantly, not for the food but for the comfort, and i was so tired i couldnt get out of bed.  I know it i sgreat to have a newborn and bond over breastfeeding, but there is no reason dad cont make a bottle and feed her.  Breast pumps didnt work well for me either.  My daughters are all healthy and beautiful.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	welll sleep deprivation and/or collic baby will really do you in, Being judgemental isnt helping anyway. some woman only do so after a hard struggle. <br>  <br>  the nights can be so hard.|`|mapqQDrMaa	i breastfed my daughter until she was 4 months old,<br>  after that i had to work to provide a roof over her head...<br>  even if you only breastfeed your child for a short time, it still makes a difference|`|y8b4Cp2Yaa	I thought breast feeding would just be a pain and it would interfere with my drinking. The costs don't bother me because WIC (taxpayers) pick up the tab of the formula, so I can go out and drink. I am at peace in mind because I know Im providing the best for my child. The formula is better than alcohol milk.
D0oqTblpaa	I don't know about being pregnant but some tests are very sensitive.  Were the lines both dark?  If the first one of lighter than it wasn't a fertile day.  That's what I'm guessing happened.  The lines of Clear Blue Easy show up no matter what but they have to both be dark blue to be positive. It's a stupid test.  I'd rather just see one line that means yes or no but it doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MOsStEbqaa	Some women have used them as pregnancy test. All you can do is take a real test. <br>  peeonastick.com they have great info on this site.|`|5axGfFofaa	No...it is getting to know your cycle and may miss your peak in the beginning or you may not have ovulated.  Keep using it as directed and if you get your period, you will get better results next month.  If you do not get your period, do a test!  Dont be discouraged....I promise it works.  I have gotten pregnant 2 times with the first month I used it both times.. ( I had m/c in Dec and just found out this week I am now pregnant again)
P544Sbmqaa	All he is doing is allowing federal funding of EMBRYONIC stem cell research.  Embryonic stem cell research doesnt even come from abortions.  In fact, by the time an abortion happens, its too late for embryonic stem cell research.  In order to do embryonic stem cell research, the embryos has to be less than 14 days old.  Most women dont even know they are preg by 14 days.  Embryonic stem cell research is done on the embryos that are trashed after IVF.  Get yourself educated about the issue.|`|AA11440601	You are correct. It is a sick question.<br>  <br>  Not all stem cell research is immoral. Only embryonic stem cell research is immoral.<br>  <br>  Catholics believe that life is a sacred gift from God and needs to be treated with all human dignity from the moment of conception to the point of natural death.<br>  <br>  For this reason, the destruction of human embryos to harvest embryonic stem cells is immoral. <br>  ? The end never justifies the means<br>  ? A moral good can never come from a moral evil<br>  <br>  Here are just a few of the common myths about Stem Cell Research:<br>  <br>  Myth: Stem cells can only come from embryos. <br>  <br>  Truth: Stem cells can be taken from:<br>  ? Umbilical cords<br>  ? The placenta<br>  ? Amniotic fluid<br>  ? Adult tissues and organs including bone marrow, fat from liposuction, regions of the nose and even dead bodies up to 20 hours after death<br>  <br>  Myth: The Catholic Church is against stem cell research. <br>  <br>  Truth: The Catholic Church approves three of the four types of stem cell research:<br>  ? Against Embryonic stem cells<br>  ? For Embryonic germ cells (from miscarriages)<br>  ? For Umbilical cord stem cells<br>  ? For Adult stem cells <br>  <br>  Myth: Embryonic stem cell research has the greatest promise<br>  <br>  Fact: Up to now, no human being has ever been cured of a disease using embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, have already cured thousands. There is the example of the use of bone marrow cells from the hipbone to repair scar tissue on the heart after heart attacks. Research using adult cells is 20-30 years ahead of embryonic stem cells and holds greater promise. <br>  <br>  Based on the “The Ten Great Myths in the Debate Over Stem Cell Research” by Tadeusz Pacholczyk, Ph.D. <a href="http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Adult stem cells are currently used for the medical treatment of:<br>  ?

AA12033653	There are risks involved with co-sleeping.  The baby could get tangled in your bedding, or could get rolled over on, or could slip under your pillow, the list goes on and on.  <br>  <br>  Both of my sisters are products of co-sleeping and nothing ever happened to either of them.  One major down fall to co-sleeping that not many people talk about is the weening part.  The older of my younger sisters slept with my parents until she was 7 because that is where she had always slept.  My parents got their bed back 4 years later when my youngest sister decided she wanted to sleep like her big sister.  <br>  <br>  My friend started co-sleeping with her daughter, and when it came time to ween her from sleeping in the same bed (she did this at about 15 months) My friend ended up losing her queen size sleep number bed to her daughter.  Her and her husband have moved into the guest room.  We joke all the time that they lost their bed to a toddler.  BTW the daughters sleep number is 70 LOL!!|`|c8DjmWXxaa	it's more than just an adult rolling over, baby could go under the duvet and find it hard to breath, a baby that hasn't develop there neck muscles yet won't be able to move into a different position in order to breath, also a baby can over heat.<br>  i suggest not doing it until baby can move.<br>  if you do take baby into bed (and we all have) be sure not to do it when you are realy tired, you don't want to fall asleep.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	It is really only dangerous if the adult has been drinking/doing drugs and is not fully aware, otherwise you know the child is there and will be conscious of it.|`|K0FabRAIaa	I let my babies sleep in my bed. I nursed them and letting them sleep in the bed with me was natural.|`|5jT9cO2haa	I was totally against this before I had a baby, BUT after the late nights I let my baby stay in bed with me after nursing and he was fine.  He now sleeps in his own crib but it was nice to hold him in my arms and fall asleep together. I am also a very light sleeper so maybe that helped out.|`|iH2whFkHaa	It's safe when you take the necessary precautions--no fluffy soft bedding, no crevices baby could get trapped in, no smokers, druggies or drinkers in the bed, etc. One of the ones people overlook alot, I think; is NOT having the baby sleep in the middle between you and your spouse. The baby should sleep with mommy away from any other persons in the bed since mom is more aware of the baby's presence. <br>  <br>  I've co slept since my son was newborn--now I only do it part time because my legs get very tense when he's next to me and hurt in the morning if he's there all night. <br>  <br>  One thing worth mentioning is that many of infant deaths that are said to have been caused by sleeping in adult beds; are NOT due to co-sleeping. They are due to the baby sleeping ALONE in an adult bed and becoming injured or suffocated as a result of being left alone.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Just because it never happened to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen. It can happen to you. I wouldn't sleep with a baby in my bed cause I'm all over the house and I'm a heavy sleeper. But it works for some people.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	I am very vocal about my opinions, I kinda have to be because my mother thinks she's a know-it-all about babies. So I get good practice at verbal sparring with her. I have had to defend my opinions about raising my child not only with her but with my child's pediatrician also. I am waiting until my baby is at least a year old before immunizing her because the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) states that people with low, compromised or abnormal immune function shouldn't be immunized. A child under a year old has a compromisedd immune system because it hasn't developed yet (states the AAP). So she agreed that if i bring her in by at least two years old to start her immunizations she wouldn't bug me which is fine by me since I was planning to immunize her anyway just not so early in her life. I'm a very outspoken person no matter where I am but I'd like to think I think a little more soft spoken when I speak on the interent because you cannot see the expression on someone face or hear the inflection of their voice through the computer (and those things can speak volumes) and I know that I have no right to judge how someone else is raising their kids if I don't want them judging me.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i would say yes i am<br>  <br>  if someone was having a conversation with me and asked my opinion or just asked me a question about something i would give my honest opinion and tell them what i thought. if they couldnt handle it, then thats their problem<br>  <br>  i do find that most people on here hide behind the computer.|`|AA12033653	I do not say anything on Yahoo Answers that I would not tell someone in person.  I am very opinionated and I typically hold back a little on YA, so I do not offend anyone LOL.|`|iH2whFkHaa	Well if someone asks my opinion about vaccines, bfing, circumcision, homebirth or whatever it may be; they better be ready to hear everything that I think about it lol. Of course take into consideration that in real life it is different since you can clearly see a person's expression, hear the tone of voice, see gestures etc. Sometimes it is easy to seem judgmental and condescending when writing things on the internet as opposed to talking in person; even when you don't mean to. So you may think these convos don't happen in real life but they just seem more toned down because you can very obviously see if someone is being harsh or not.<br>  <br>  It is very rarely that people ask me questions like that though. <br>  <br>  Just last week my husband's uncle and aunt were talking to me and we got onto the subject of vaccines and they were so so confused and shocked when I said vaccines are dangerous lol but I continued to explain and they were like haha you are crazy but I guess he will be fine.
AA12033653	I am planning on getting what ever I can!  With any labor you don't know how fast you will progress.  I am going into my first delivery with the mind set that I will take what I can get!

GU3RauKOaa	Yes, season his food! People who feed their toddlers bland food often end up with a picky eater who only wants plain pasta and chicken nuggets.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't add too much salt as he doesn't need the sodium but other herbs and seasonings like pepper, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, parsley, etc., are great! They will help him expand his taste buds.|`|nDEVWjCEaa	No  if it isn't bothering your son then it should be fine .. but other heavier spices i wouln't give him right now.  im not too sure about salt though... ask your bf if he would only like to eat bland foods....|`|CQVzUcw7aa	You could try using not as spicy things first, then see if he can handle it. Slowly make things a little spicier up until you get to the point where it satisfies you.<br>  <br>  But just to make sure, call your doctor.|`|BsJDl6YOaa	As long as it isn't giving him a diaper rash when he goes potty or crying excessively i don't see it to be a problem but i wouldn't go any farther my daughter has some of that as well. and she is fine|`|E7IPy6cDaa	no, that stuff is fine. why would you want a child to eat a bland diet? as long as you arent using hot sauce i dont see whats wrong with your child enjoying flavorful food.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Nope! He's fine. Let him eat what you eat. My daughter at that age loved jalepeno peppers! Hey if you eat healthy your son will too! Same foods same diet! Good luck|`|nxVGEKeUaa	you can season his food, after all his taste buds have develop and he likes things that taste good, just as well as you. Just be careful of the salt intake. Just like you and me he does not need a bunch of salt.

VudhjHi2aa	Well Let me think.<br>  In My personal opinion it's your choice. Do you mined that your 2 yr old is still sleeping in the same room as you and your hubby? If you don't then more power to you. Me on the other hand would want to help him to start sleeping in his own room soon. So mommy and daddy can have adult time. <br>  <br>   About the baby I think it is perfectly normal for a young child (especially one that is still stuck to the boob) to still co-sleep. I did with my son when I nursed him. And even when I had to stop nursing I still did because when the baby is still getting up every few hours it's just so much easier. <br>  <br>  But then It came to a time with my family that it was just time for him to move to his BIG BOY room. My Hubby was not ready at first so I waited a lil but longer and the first night I put him in his room just for the first part of the night. And that worked, Both my husband and the baby got a real good nights sleep.(YEAH)<br>  My son just loves to be in his own crib he can't sleep very well any place other than his own bed. (He just sleeps better and longer in his crib)(guess I am lucky he loves it so much)<br>  <br>  Talking about this reminded me of my littler sister who slept with my mother gosh till Jr. High ( I think) I know she slept in her own room a few nights before but for the most part she liked to sleep in the room with my mother. And she took up most of the bed and my mother sometimes had to get out of the bed and move to the couch. Now I personal think that is way to long but my mother was on her own and I guess it was good for the both of them to have someone there.

I personally love it because I get both.  She is sleeping in her crib now and I get to have time for myself.  I love waking up with her and see her look over at me and smile.|`|TUSNeUCcaa	I co slept with all 3 of my children up until they became the Big Sister or Brother  then they naturally progressed to their own bed as it got too crowded with Mummy, Daddy,New Baby & them & because I demand fed they weren't keen on getting woken up several times a night with my youngest he slept with me till he started Kindergarten then he told me he was a Big Kid now & went to his room with his older Brother Co sleeping doesn't work for everyone I think it's a matter of personal choice|`|JAdNkzENaa	co sleeping is not for everyone. we choose to co sleep because it easier. to those moms who tough it out and put their babies back in their cribs kudos to you - id rather snuggle. we also dont believe in the cry it out method so everyone's entitled to their own opinion right ? =)|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	I co-sleep every night, but it is ok with me because I want him to be close. especially when he nurses at night.|`|Uz8BZN6daa	I recommend NOT to, ever.  Children need to know from a young age which is their space and which is their parents'.|`|PIfaJRuoaa	I don't have a problem with co-sleeping.  Whenever I go out of town the baby sleeps with me.  He also sleeps with me during naps, and occasionally if he wakes up to eat around 6, he'll go back to sleep with me for about an hour.  The rest of the time he sleeps in his crib, in my room.<br>  My obgyn has 4 kids and she co-slept with all of them and she swears by it.<br>  Some people are really against it.  I do know someone whose husband rolled onto their 3 week old and suffocated her, and she passed away.  I believe you can co-sleep if you are careful.  I love the extra time I get to snuggle and bond with my son...  =)|`|zHG5gjBZaa	We are in the exactly same thing. Our two year old slept with us from about 5 days and is now in his bed in our room (big boy now). Our baby is 8 weeks old and wakes at 230am and I put him in bed next to me until 430 when he has a feed I use a back protector so he cant roll either way and I put him next to me.<br>  <br>  You have to trust yourself that you wont roll on your baby we never did (my husband and I) I used to joke that I slept with one eye open. If you are confident go for it place baby higher up in the bed then you and don't use a heavy comforter.<br>  <br>  Alot of my family criticized us for this method but it worked for us and we are extremely close with out toddler because we had this extra bonding experience. He just happened to be ready to jump into his toddler bed. Good Luck|`|GNLYxY7kaa	i love to co sleep w our 8 month old but it does interfere with our sex life! i love snuggling my baby so i cant help it. my hubby tries to put him in his bed and i try and stop him lol. i did the same as you tho...when he feeds at night he stays in our bed|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	It's totally up to you.

kiAQi91laa	I like the name Laura as much as l like my own name Cathrine.  There's just isn't any spark when saying the name.  Since, I'm having a baby girl soon, I've been looking at all the new names that came out like Chelsea, Kayla, Kylie, and Hailee.  <br>  <br>  If I had enough balls I'd change my first name, but it's a bit of bold move coming from a catholic family...we're all named after Saints.<br>  <br>  The good thing is, our names such as Laura, Cathrine, Marie, Teresa...etc... etc...   do sound a lot better than even older names such as Ina, Agna, or Helga!!!  <- there are a few people in the world still naming their daughters with these names.  Ina was one of my grandmother's name and none of her descendants were named the same.|`|SAvpk6Isaa	Laura is a very beautiful name. Its very common and is of Latin origin, and its meaning is "the bay, or laurel plant". In classical times, a crown was made from the leaves of the bay laurel for heroes or victors as a symbol of honor and victory. So yes, I do like the name Laura. :)
AA11603234	Try a different kind of pacifier. We had a 'Soothie' given to us by the hospital. He loved it but couldn't keep it in. Then we tried a Playtex Ortho-Pro (or something like that) and it molded to his mouth much better and stayed in. HTH!|`|hLohtlPEaa	Just be patient. He will soon be able to put it back in his mouth himself. Put him in a bed closer to your bed until he's a little older. I put my daughters cradle next to my bed so I could just reach in and settle her. I got much more sleep that way.|`|MUbQsm2daa	My sons use too do the same. The only way to stop this happening is to try not using the dummy as much at night when he is sleeping. Expect a few bad unsettled nights but (you are already having those) and keep trying too settle him without the dummy it will probably take 3 or 4 nights. Save the dummy for the day time until he is older and able to keep it in and or put it in himself.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	This is the same age as my daughter started sleeping much less. She was so alert and active (still is) and didn't seem to need as much sleep during the day. She only had about 4x 30 min naps during the day but then slept 3-5 hours straight during the night. So all up she was getting just enough sleep. If you've got an active baby they might start sleeping less during the day sooner...but if it is affecting his night sleeping then he probably needs more.<br>  <br>  Have you tried putting him to bed without a dummy? Sorry I don't have many suggestions for you but he will probably start to sleep heavier soon which means losing the dummy shouldn't wake him up.|`|m71EaUU0aa	My son was the same way, and we found that it didn't necessarily have to be in his mouth.. in his circumstance he either wanted it in his mouth or when it fell out from sleeping, he would tuck it behind his ear lol. Try having it right next to his face...for a few nights when he wakes up from dropping it, try just putting it right by his face, pushing against his cheek or something so that he can either sleep with it like that, turn his head towards it and suck on it, or figure out his own way to get it in his mouth...it took a few days for him to figure it out, but it ended up being the only way to soothe him even after he stopped using it...it always had to be by his ear lol. Weird I know...But he was the same, he had reflux 2, so I thought I would share.

G83yqe75aa	Ways to Build Up Your Milk Production<br>  New mothers sometimes fear that they won’t have enough milk to feed their babies. They hear stories about other women who “didn’t have enough milk,” and they worry that they might be in this category. But when you look closely at the situations of these other women, the problem can almost always be ascribed to lack of information, lack of encouragement, or faulty nursing technique by either mother or baby. You need to tell yourself that millions of other women nurse their babies, and you can, too. Following one or more of the suggestions below should increase your milk supply within a few days.<br>  ? Nurse your baby more frequently for several days, using both breasts at each feeding. This is the single best way to enhance your flow of milk.<br>  ? Wake your baby, if necessary, to feed him more often.<br>  * Pump or express milk between feedings. But don’t get discouraged if your pumping yields as little as half an ounce of breast milk. Your baby is almost certainly getting more than this. Even the best pump is less effective than a vigorously nursing baby. (More about pumping in Chapters 16 and 17.)<br>  ? See a lactation specialist if your baby is not suckling well or nurses only a few minutes at a time.<br>  ? Cut back on your schedule. Do less. Rest more. Nap at least once a day, more often if you can manage it. Ask someone else to help with marketing, cooking simple meals (or getting take-out food), and doing basic laundry. Most people like to help a new mother, so take advantage of this willingness now. You can always reciprocate later on.<br>  * Even though everyone wants to see the new baby, ask visitors not to come for several days -- or even weeks -- unless they’re people who will wait on you, not expect you to entertain them. Let your answering machine take phone calls – which you can return later when you’re not so tired. Well-meaning family and friends can wear out the new mom.<br>  ? If you can, take an occasional day or two off from work or from other obligations (by, for example, having someone come in to care for your other children) so that you can focus only on nursing your baby.<br>  ? Check your diet. Are you eating enough? Are you eating the right foods? Are you drinking enough fluids? Some women find that eating or drinking more seems to produce more milk. Keeping a glass of water or juice near the spot where you nurse is a good idea. You don’t need to drink any more than you need to meet your thirst, but some nursing moms find that they are thirstier than usual.<br>  ? Make a special effort to relax, as suggested in the box on page tk. Of course, this is hard when you’re concerned that your baby isn’t getting enough milk—but the more you can relax, the more milk your baby is likely to receive.<br>  ? Develop a few affirmations that you can repeat to yourself, such as: “I am a bounteous supplier of milk for my baby”; “I am doing the best thing I can as a mother”; “My baby is growing fit and healthy from my milk”; “My milk is my baby’s perfect food.”<br>  * Visualize your baby at a little older age, looking well fed and  happy.<br>  * Galactogogues: Virtually every culture in the world has recommended certain foods or substances to nursing mothers, in the belief that they help to make milk. In China, nursing mothers have been urged to eat “a mixture of pork fat and red gram (a type of bean), cuttlefish soup, shrimps’ heads in wine, and a special sweet wine made from glutinous rice, given together with the larvae of the blow-fly.” In India, it’s garlic, tamarind, and cottonseed; in France, powdered fennel; and in Nepal, chicken soup, buffalo milk, butter, and rice. In the U.S. vitamin B complex, brewer’s yeast, and the herbs fenugreek (also called fenugeek) and blessed thistle are sometimes recommended, as is the controversial prescription drug domperidone, which has not been approved for any use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (See Chapter 10 and the Websites Appendix for more about drugs and lactation.)<br>    Cheston M. Berlin, Jr., M.D., a professor of pediatrics and pharmacology who has an interest in drugs and lactation, has concluded that the effects of such potions may be largely psychological. The mother thinks that a certain substance will increase her milk supply, so she relaxes and has a good let-down reflex, thus “proving” its value.<br>  As we have stated, though, the best way to build up your milk supply isn’t what you eat. It’s what—and how much—and how often—your baby eats. The cutting edge research of Dr. Peter E. Hartmann’s Australian team (discussed in Chapter 3) has  confirmed what many breastfeeding experts have known for years: that emptying the breast is the best stimulus to milk production. The more often you nurse your baby and the more vigorously she nurses, the more milk you’re likely to have.<br>  ? Believe in yourself and trust your body.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	I offer one side for about 10 minutes and then I switch her to the other side. The next time I nurse her I would start with the side I finished nursing her with. You should continue to pump a little after nursing. It will build your supply and you can use in the future when you need to go out, go to work, or if you get sick (husband can help with the feeding)<br>  <br>  If my baby gets full from nursing on one side and refuse to nurse on the other side, I would pump.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i think you re doing fine - i was always worried if i was rotating my breasts enough to make sure one didnt over produce but that never happened. come to find out it takes like 5 days-2 weeks for your milk to dry up. pump after you nurse. pump both sides<br>  i have large breasts and after my baby was done, i could sometimes pump and get 4 oz on each side. 5 is great|`|c8DjmWXxaa	breast feeding is hard, you are doing well, it is ok to swap baby over, your body will produce the exact amount of milk your baby needs and more, he will want more as he gets a little older, so your body will naturally produce more, the only problem is not to allow yourself to stay full if he is not hungry,your breasts will start to hurt, then you need to pump, if you don't it can make you ill, when you do pump (and you will) do not throw it away, it is precious, and in the middle of the night if daddy is about he can then get up and feed him the pumped milk, that's what i always did.<br>  i miss those nights. really i do, its special, persevere for as long as as you can, your baby deserves the best he can get.<br>  some mothers cant manage it for long, as i said before it can be very difficult.<br>  good luck to you both.|`|HvSWapZraa	They told me to do half and half!|`|B6tGYfEgaa	Hi! I had several different (not so bad, but problematic) issues with breastfeeding myself. My daughter is now four months old and it's all perfect and easy and smooth. I'm glad I stuck with it and my main message to any new breastfeeding mother is to stick with it, IT GETS SO MUCH EASIER. this is the best website i found, and believe me, i did tons and tons of research: <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/</a><br>  i found that the best for me was letting her drain one side and then moving her to the next. i let the baby make the 'decisions' on how much she wants. plenty of burping was important for us (burping after first and then after second breast). drinking tons of water and being relaxed and breastfeeding as often as possible keeps the supply up. i pump from one breast at the same tme that she's feeding on the other, as unromantic as that is (because the milk is coming in while she's feeding). i can go on and on but i find that everyone is different, milk supply and feeding techniques and every baby is so different, that the most important thing is to do what's working for you. good luck!!!!!!!!!!! i admire and respect any woman who plows on, because i know from firsthand how diffcult it is/can be, and as i said, my issues were not too big.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	It sounds like you are doing great. 5 oz is good for only breastfeeding 9 weeks. Just keep doing what you are doing and it will gradually get easier.|`|wphLaVs6aa	Pumping 5 oz while not missing any feedings is amazing! I wouldn't go crazy with pumping in addition to nursing. You will need to pump when you are at work to maintain your milk supply and feed your baby while you're not with her. So if you have one day 's supply in the freezer, you'll be fine for your first day and can pump at work and replenish the supply. I understand wanting to build a stash, and you can, but just be aware that consistently pumping in addition to feedings (rather than only for missed feedings) will increase your milk supply. That sounds great, right? The problem is, you can end up with an oversupply problem, which results in 1) a fussy, gassy baby; 2) an overactive letdown, meaning milk comes out of your nipples far too fast and baby gets overwhelmed and sometimes refuses to nurse. Oversupy is fixable, but it's not fun fixing it. <br>  <br>  I had a similar strategy as you before I went back to work and ended up with oversupply issues. That's why I bring it up. I recommend pumping just once a day while you're with your baby full time. Don't worry about the mother's milk tea or boosting your supply. Just remember that you want enough milk to feed your baby and not a whole lot more. The supply and demand balance is pretty fine tuned and sensitive.
QP46eVi4aa	No sources needed <br>  All the answers to this one is NO<br>  <br>  You need to speak to your mom about all this and let her explain the birds and the bees|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Unless her pillow is stuffed with a male penis she can't get pregnant.

kiAQi91laa	Since you started dating November of last year and conceived shortly after.  No specific time was given by you, but knowing you're 5 months pregnant now you conceived in November.  You both were shocked about pregnancy and it is natural to want to bond with the person you conceived the child with.  I really do think he wanted to build a stable relationship with you initially, but it's just not working. <br>  <br>   <br>  I don't think you have overreacted when you're talking about trust issues.  If he did something that warrants your lack of in trust in him or you just don't trust in him regardless if he has done nothing wrong.   There is just no trust...maybe it can be regained over time, but right now it's just not there.  This lays a heavy toll on any marriage or relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am glad your independent, because I learned to be when I left my ex-husband.  Right now you need to concentrate on your stability at work and for the future of you and your child.  When I was with my ex husband we had to get government assistance, but as a single mom I supported everything for me and my children.  No support needed from my ex-husband or from the government, but do what you can.  If you need help from your ex then he should be paying for child support and some single mothers need help and there are government programs that can aid.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't waste my time concentrating on the "what" or "if" of the relationship you had with your boyfriend.  Let time pass to see if he can ever gain your trust or is even worthy enough to have a committed relationship with.|`|3cVPWJhDaa	I think that if you can't trust him then why stay with him? You and your body don't need to be stressed right now that your pregnant it's not good. You two could try and work it out but if it doesn't work then be strong you could take care of your baby and yourself. Just try not to worry to much about it. If he wants to be with you then he will, if not then he ain't worth the hassle. Good luck to you and your baby.

The technician poked my stomach repeatedly with the ultrasound wand and eventually she moved (reluctantly). I would ask your doctor about checking the sex and if it will be too late. Could she possibly see you earlier and check the sex herself if so? I don't think there is much you can do, besides trying the jolt of sugar or caffeine ahead of time, but the ultrasound tech CAN wake them up and get them to move by poking your stomach (and it shouldn't hurt them). <br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope you find out soon!|`|CFFuFof1aa	Drink you a big glass of orange juice before you go.

Had enough support to help a baby sit, was somewhat slip resistant (at least the one I had was, mines only available in canada *lol*) and because it was a bit squishy my son wouldn't try to stand (thank god)|`|0LBRPVOqaa	i never used a baby bath tub. i just bought a Comfy Bear Bath Sponge from walmart, laid it in my bath tub and laid my daughter on it. worked good for us!<br>  now she is one and we bought a dora the explorer bath mat so she doesn't slide all over the place in the tub!|`|hxdWDY3Iaa	Get him the bath tub he can sit in....|`|3CuJ3CAoaa	Have you tried a Bumba seat? thats what we use and it works great...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bumbobabyseat.com/orderbumbobabyseat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bumbobabyseat.com/orderbumbob...</a>|`|AA11795652	I haven't tried all those tubs, but I have a simple blue oval plastic tub with no fancy gadgets, grooves, ramps, or anything and I love it.   I would put it on the counter-top so I wouldn't kill my back and I would bathe my son in there and just use one hand to support him and the other hand to wash him.  He loved it too.  It has wavy rubber strips on the bottom of the tub and the bottom of the inside of the tub to keep from slipping.  I still occasionally use it for him and he's almost 11 months so it's obviously roomy and I like that I can put enough water so he's not cold and the water goes up pretty high.  I would use it more but since I have a 4-year-old (who also used the same tub), the two kids take baths in the big tub together now since he can sit up.  I can't find the tub I have online and I've tried looking but I saw a pretty good decent tub at Wal-mart that would work.  My mom got my tub for $5 at a consignment store and it was in perfect condition.  I still cleaned and sterilized it and used it for my daughter up until she was 3 for when I wanted to give her a quick bath and not fill up the whole tub.  Hope this helps you somehow!|`|AA12033653	<a href="http://www.safety1st.com/uploads/products/medium/2754_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.safety1st.com/uploads/product...</a><br>  <br>  I received one of these as a baby gift.  I was skeptical of this until I saw a picture of my boss's baby in it.  I asked her about it, and she said she loves it.  She said it is the safest most convenient way to bathe her son.  She told me that she wished she would have had one with her first son because she had a lot of the same issues that you have found with the other ways to bathe baby.  <br>  <br>  The only other suggestion I have is, what my parents did.  Put a wash cloth in the bottom of the kitchen sink, then fill it half way or less with water and bathe the baby in there.  The wash cloth makes it so the baby does not slip and slide.|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	I got this for my shower. It has worked great for me. my baby was 3lbs when I brought her home and is now 10 months and 15 lbs about 25" long and is now sitting on her own. It has worked great the entire time. It's nothing special, just does the job. the spa, is lame and doesnt really work, but I love the tub. <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2908734" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  This is the one I am thinking of buying, because the baby can sit in it more assisted.<br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2403667" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|WlU3NFu6aa	For some reason my work computer blocks teh safety first links, but my daughter has this <a href="http://www.lullabyebaby.com/juvenile_sol/baby_bath_seat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lullabyebaby.com/juvenile_sol...</a><br>  she's been using since she was about 9 months.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	<a href="http://www.nextag.com/munchkin-duck-bath-tub-baby/search-html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextag.com/munchkin-duck-bath...</a><br>  This is the tub Dane uses.

SxPhldhhaa	Yes, I definitely think it's good discipline. In fact, to me it would've seemed more awkward if she didn't punish her kids at all for something they did wrong. It's nobody else's business how you discipline your child, as long as you're doing it right - and a time-out is a very appropriate punishment. I wouldn't have minded what others thought.|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	Yes, whether it's in public or not, people need to punish their kids. no-matter where they're. kids need to be punished, and i think the kids being embarrased makes them not do what they did b4 that got them in trouble<br>  so, i don't think it's a bad punishment. <br>  it was  a good punishment, and it shows the mom was a really good mom.|`|8UlhnEc0aa	yes, i think that you should discipline kids nowadays because there little gets and if they don't get disciplined they will never learn. Better to do it whilst there young because it wont be as embarrassing as when your older. My mum disciplined me in public and its was embarrassing, so i learned not to do it again.|`|fNv2Re6baa	Yes, I believe that it is fine to do that in public. Or if you are shopping and your kids are old enough but misbehaving, get them to wait outside the shop. Also take privileges. But yes, I think it is perfectly appropriate.|`|AA10349002	The embarrassment is what makes it good discipline.   I think it is ok.|`|Pp6mteQdaa	You bet it's ok. If she did nothing they would think what they were doing was fine, then every time the go into a public place they can do what they want. It doesn't help to tell them that you'll punish them when you get home, because they don't care about that until they are home, and the punishment begins.  With children, the best bet is to be consistent. Next time they are there, I doubt the little fingers will be hitting the buttons!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	Where ever I go I tell them pick a corner.. I dont care what people think . They probably hit their kids and could learn from ME. If there is no corner ..find a tree and face it ..because time out is portable and can be used anywhere
eba7fefdf839622869be8b19d9b9ca2baa	Thats exactly what my mom said.<br>  And it will be awkward to tell your mom <br>  "Hey, Mom I'm going to go have sex soon, I want on birth control" I mean you can't say that...<br>  <br>  Just be like:<br>  "Momma, I am start to be having cramps bad, and when ever I do decide to have sex I will know that I am protected and I won't make you a young grandmaw." :D|`|qnOiHSgKaa	Just flat out tell your mom, i want to start taking birth control because i'm not sure whats gonna happen in the next couple years and i wanna make sure i'm prepared.<br>  <br>  i mean if you're anticipating it, she won't assume you're already having it.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	Why do you need it now? Are you planning on having sex? It honestly does sound like you want to have sex because she said you can get birth control. Remember, birth control fails, why not just prevent a pregnancy all together -- please abstain for at least two more years.<br>  <br>  However, if you must ask, just say you want it in case something were to happen. But please, make it with a BF of at least a year. Too many people regret their first time. Be careful hun.<br>  <br>  Also, you could tell her that you want it in order to make your periods lighter, and shorter. But considering you recently talked to her regarding the pregnancy matter, she will know; and that's okay.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mom about this stuff -- it will be beneficial to the both of you. Tell her what's on your mind, and see what she wants to do. Maybe she will let, maybe not. <br>  <br>  If you do get on birth control, use a condom too. Birth control solely protects against pregnancy; not STD's. Make sure that you are ready both physically and emotionally before you have sex of any form. <br>  <br>  I'm 15 and I'm nearly 24 weeks pregnant. I was stupid -- yes. I would hate to see other teenagers make the same mistake I did. (not saying that my daughter is a mistake.) Think about what you're doing. Think about the consequences. <br>  <br>  Oh, and before you go on birth control, you have to have a full exam at the Gyno. That will be way more uncomfortable than talking to your mom -- trust me. Lol. Think carefully about this decision; as it may not be the best one. <br>  <br>  It's great that you're still a virgin. Try and keep it that way. Lol. I hope you find a solution. Email me if you want, I always reply. Message me for my MSN address if you want. Good luck. -x-<br>  <br>  -Violet|`|UcgWrGaAaa	You could text her.  If you do ask though, she will think you are going to have sex.  There is no other reason to go on birth control, well, if you have female problems, but if you can't discuss it then you're not ready either.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	It's great that you and your mom are honest and have a communicative relationship where you two can talk about these things. I would tell her your not planning to but want it available for when you do want to. Having it around so you can take it when you're ready is a good thing. Tell her you just want to responsibile and make her proud of you, I know it sounds cheesy but trust me she wants to hear you say it. <br>  <br>  That being said taking it just because is not a good thing it prevents the absorption of important vitamins and minerals. Without supplements you can get osteoporosis because of inadequate calcium intake. Here's some info . . . <br>  <br>  Nutrients that can be reduced by the use of Oral Contraceptives (OC):<br>  <br>  Folic Acid (Folate). Birth control pills tend to cause folic acid depletion and increase the risk of cervical dysplasia and vascular thrombosis, stroke, and possibly megaloblastic anemia.<br>  <br>  B-vitamins. As several B-vitamins are affected negatively by birth control pill use, a B-complex supplement is suggested, especially vitamin B6 if depression is present.<br>  <br>  Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid). Levels are lowered by OC use which interferes with the metabolism of ascorbic acid. Insufficient intake of ascorbate is also associated with an increased risk of cervical dysplasia.<br>  <br>  Selenium. Selenium absorption may be reduced. Selenium is an important nutrient for cancer prevention.<br>  <br>  Nutrients that can be increased by the use of Oral Contraceptives:<br>  <br>  Calcium. Calcium absorption may be increased with exercise and short term OC use, but in one study no benefit was seen with exercise and chronic OC use.<br>  <br>  Copper and Zinc. Copper is generally increased and elevated copper is associated with an increased death from cardiovascular disease. Copper and zinc tend to antagonistic, so an elevated copper level will result in a lower zinc status.<br>  <br>  Iron. Premenopausal women using oral contraceptives may have a decreased need for supplemental iron, as the use of OCs can increase iron stores. Iron testing may be appropriate in long term users.<br>  <br>  It is a must when you begin to take contraceptives to take a daily vitamin pill and it would be a good idea to take an extra calcium pill also. You are still growing and developing your body needs these things to develop correclty and healthily. I learned these things the hard way because my doctor didn't tell me when I started on birth control,  2 years later I was on the verge of osteoporosis and my iron level were way too high. I didn't find out this stuff until I got a stress facture in my foot which almost never happens at age 19. Please be careful with your body it is the only one you get and do your own research when it comes to birth control. Do not depend on your doctor to tell you everything you need to know, it's not that they don't care they just don't have the time. And if your birth control has too many side effects for you don't just sit there and take it, switch to a different kind. You'll never know how it will effect you until you take it but keep trying different ones until you find one that is right for. Remember they only keep you from getting pregnant, it won't protect you against STDs so have her buy you some ocndoms to so you can be completely prepared when you need to be, most men are asymptomatic so do not trust him if he says he doesn't have anything make him where the condom anyway, if he doesn't want to tell him no. Your body is a temple, respect it and demand that others do so also!

ZLpgjLPyaa	Actually pcos is the bodys attempt to make you ovulate(you still get positive opks) but you do not release an egg. You can get an LH surge so then it looks like you ovulated on an opk but indeed you do not ovulate. I have gained weight over the years(after depo) also i had a normal 28 day cycle and then after my loss it went to 35-37 day cycle then after my hsg i havent had a period since december. PCOS is the buidup of the attempt at making an egg, it isnt actually cysts it just looks like tiny little bubbles all over your ovaries. Also i have pcos but do not have any hormonal issues and no other signs. Alot of women do not know that they have pcos because they have been on birth control which suppresses ovulation but once they come off then your body tries to ovulate and then the buildup starts and then you will gain weight and then your hormones will get out of whack(eventually could take years) then you will have abnormal hair growth, acne, weight gain etc. You will have to get a vaginal ultrasound to see if you have pcos. EVen women with normal body weight and regular periods have pcos, it is sometimes left undetected for years.|`|jzAfst8Taa	pcos is when you make to much male hormone and not enough female hormone to help the egg mature and release instead it turn into a small cyst.

But in the meantime just watch yourself for any typical allergic reactions you may get. Or if you feel more comfortable then you could always go to the ER.

ZLpgjLPyaa	The uterus is normally suspended in a straight up and down position or slightly forward toward the belly in your body. A tipped uterus is the term used to describe a uterus that is tilted backwards or forwards away from the belly. The condition is also referred to as a retroverted uterus or tilted uterus and all the three terms are interchangeable. There are also a few other alternative terms that can be used to describe this situation. Common substitutes include:<br>  <br>  retroflexed uterus <br>  tilted uterus <br>  backward uterus <br>  retroverted uterus <br>  <br>  Fimbriated Ends: the fringed and flaring outer ends of the fallopian tubes which capture the egg after it is released from the ovary.<br>  <br>  <br>  So with this said..lol I think that you have a tilted uterus and your tubes are both to the right(they are usually one on each side) and that the dye went all the way through to the end of your ovary. SO i think that it may be more difficult with the tilted uterus, and the tubes could be a problem if they were pushing on one another but that doesnt seem to be the problem since the dye goes all the way through. So there is no blockage just the tilted uterus.

trXjBRlRaa	Yes. They are early signs of pregnancy. How long ago did you have unprotected sex? Have you taken a home pregnancy test (HPT)? Have you seen your doctor for a blood test (the most reliable method in learning if you are or are not pregnant)?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|soFzO7C2aa	those definately are SOME symptoms but at the same time a lot of it can be nerves in thinking that you are. i would definately get a blood test because HPT's can be wrong and i don't think you want to gamble with results like these! Good luck girl
nISYAHkfaa	Yes, there is a very high chance.<br>  <br>  Sorry you're having difficulties . . . and I hope this month aunt flow stays home! =)|`|ZvkX9uNraa	You need to get an ovulation predictor kit. Not every woman ovulates on a 28 day cycle. When I became pregnant I was using an OPK and I ovulated approx 26 days after my LMP. When you get a positive OPK test, that means that you will ovulate within the next 12-72 hours. This is how I became pregnant after months of coming up with negative pregnancy tests. Best of luck!!|`|CFFuFof1aa	Yes, it is very likely that you are pregnant and the dates sound right. But quit worrying and stressing about being pregnant, believe it or not it can make it harder to conceive. It sounds like you are doing everything right.|`|ecLVTXKUaa	These dates depend on how long ur cycle is...|`|sFGgPTk3aa	The few days before and after your ovulation date are your best chances, but you only want to have sex every other day.  Good luck!
Ojgqd4xNaa	Ready-to-Feed is slightly more money.  I paid a little over 9 dollars for 32ounces of Ready-to-feed, and for 115ounces made from powder, it's 27.99, so for 28 dollars, you would only get 96 ounces of formula.  But don't use my numbers, I have to use Similac Alimentum, and I'm just using them because I don't know the prices of the other stuff.<br>       <br>  Ready-to-Feed is great because you don't ever have to measure, it's always perfect, and great for odd number of ounces.  Like if you baby is drinking 3 ounces, you don't have to try and measure half a scoop of powder.  The down side is it sucks to travel with.  You have to keep it cold, and try to find a way to heat it up.  If your baby is on a good schedule with eating, which my daughter wasn't for a while, then you can plan ahead of time, and use a car bottle warmer, which takes 30min to heat up a 6ounce bottle.<br>      <br>   The powder is easy to travel.  You can just bring a thermis with hot water, and mix it where ever you like.  You do have to mess around with mixing, and measureing, and it never comes out exactly the same.  I've also heard it stains less, but this is somthing I really can't agree with, because my daughters clothes don't have any stains on them from when I used powdered before, or Ready-to-Feed now.  I just take care of her clothes good.  The RTF does have sort of a darker color to it.<br>       <br>   So if your somone who is out and about a lot.  I would say go with the powder.  It is also cheaper.  It would be a pain to do both, and more costly.  The RTF in a normal formula needs to be used within 72hrs, the one I use is 48hrs.  So unless you out all day for 3 days in a row, you'd be wasting a ton.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|w7FSmSTnaa	Ive used both because the hospital says only use premix for the first 6 weeks beause of something in the packaging in the powder that can make them sick. Premix is VERY expensive about 8.00 a container and it would last about 1-2 days if that and that was when he was eating less as a newborn. We switched over to powder and that runs about 25.00 a week or so. Yes the premix is easier but not by much but saving the money was worth the extra minute it takes to make the powder.|`|uCLenopbaa	if your baby will drink room-tempeture water than powder is easier. all you have to do is pour bottled water into a bottle, and add the powder and shake- no warming it up.<br>  <br>  but if he/she will only drink warm formula that premixed is easier, so all you have to do is dump it into a bottle and warm it up. instead of mixing and warming.<br>  <br>  it all depends on the baby.  but powder is better if your going to be away from home for a long time (so you don't have to worry about it spoiling)|`|PBI3tCKaaa	I use powdered, but if you are very busy here is what I do:  I make the powder formula in a pitcher(based on how many scoops he uses a day) and refrigerate it and pour it for my son throughout the day.

For this reason it is NOT safe to mix it with hot tap water.  <br>  <br>  Nor is it safe to use hot tap water to mix any formula because hot water heaters can contain many contaminants at high levels such as lead because the water evapourates and heavy metals build up.<br>  <br>  Liquid formula (ready to eat and concentrate) is contaminated with BPA because the can linings contain BPA which leeches into the formula when it is heat sterilized.  I don't believe that any formula companies have replaced the can linings with BPA free linings as of yet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infactcanada.ca/Newsletters/2007-Winter/safety_guidlines.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infactcanada.ca/Newsletters/2...</a><br>  E. sakazakii is a highly virulent bacteria which is resistant to the high-temperature processing methods used in food production. If infants, especially those who are newborn, low-birthweight or premature, are infected with E. sakazakii, it can cause meningitis, necrotizing entercolitis, and sepsis, and is potentially fatal. As a result of reports of baby deaths from E. sakazakii contamination in recent years the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have declared this a significant public health hazard and have convened two expert meetings on the issue: one in 2004 and more recently in January of 2006. After reviewing the scientific evidence the 2006 meeting produced a report noting that both manufacturers and governments must act to reduce the health risks associated with the intrinsic contamination by E. sakazakii. Studies reviewed by the meeting noted that up to 14 per cent of formula packages may be contaminated by the bacteria.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/pif_guidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publicatio...</a><br>  Powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness and death in infants due to infections<br>  with Enterobacter sakazakii.

This is because, using current manufacturing technology, it is<br>  not feasible to produce sterile PIF. During the preparation of PIF, inappropriate handling practices can exacerbate<br>  the problem<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  In general, sterile liquid infant formula is recommended for infants at the highest risk of infection.

To avoid this, use cold water and let the water run for a couple of minutes before you use it if that tap has not been used for a while, overnight, or all day. You can then heat this water on the stove. Catching the water you flush out of the tap in a container and saving it for plant watering is a good conservation measure. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dcwasa.com/waterquality/faqs.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcwasa.com/waterquality/faqs....</a><br>  Is it okay to use water from the hot water tap for drinking, cooking, or making baby formula?<br>  Hot water generally comes from a hot water heater that may contain impurities that should not be ingested. Some of these impurities might be metals from household plumbing that are concentrated in the heating process. Additionally, these impurities from the household plumbing dissolve more rapidly in hot water than cold water causing the amount of impurities to be higher in hot water. Therefore, cold water should be used for all drinking and cooking uses, as well as for baby formula. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ewg.org/newsrelease/Infant-Formula-Makers-and-Canned-Food-Producers-Called-On-To-Remove-BPA" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewg.org/newsrelease/Infant-Fo...</a><br>  “Liquid formula is the biggest culprit in exposing infants to a toxic hormone-disrupting chemical, but kid-friendly foods like canned chicken noodle soup and ravioli also have high levels of BPA,” said EWG Senior Analyst Sonya Lunder. “BPA was initially used as a sex hormone.

The premixed formula is WAYYYYY more expensive. However it is easier and in a way safer because you don't run the risk of using contaminated water or contaminating your powdered formula can.<br>  <br>  But since I'm sure you will be very careful to use boiled water, wash your hands, and keep the formula can clean then there is really no need to buy the premixed. You might carry a few small bottles (they have ones that pre packaged bottle nips attach to) in your car for emergencies, or bring some small cans when you are out and about. Good luck and congrats!|`|c73QkZ2haa	While the powder is alot easier when your out and about but i found that the powder gave them more gas and they spit up more often so we switched to the liquid concentrate and with the brand we are using i actually figured out that we save about 5 dollars a month by buying the liquid concentrate rather than the powder. They dont have alot of options for premixed formula around here its pretty much liquid concentrate or powder that you add the water too.<br>  Its alot easier to mismeasure with the powder as well and it doesnt mix easy so sometimes the nipples get clogged.

I had to use the Ready to Feed formula for my daughter so I never had to deal with the powder.  I loved it.  It was so smooth. No bubble, lumps, or mixing.  I Just opened the can, filled the bottles, and stuck them in the fridge.  A minute (or less) in the bottle warmer and we were set.  When we went out and about I had a bottle cooler that held 2 bottles and took that with us.  I either ran the bottle under hot water or used the car bottle warmer to heat it to room temp and we were good.  I even had the "Night and Day Bottle Warmer" that I kept in the nursery that kept two bottles cold all night and had the built in warmer.  It was the best.<br>  <br>  I am so in love with the ready to feed formula that I want to use it again, even though it was pricey.  I am actually looking into a third option: concentrate.

I can just mix the bottles at home and keep them in the fridge.  and that would be the same for on the go....cold bottles in bottle cooler and have to heat them when out.  But it would give me the liquid that I have gotten so used to.  I would strongly recommend the liquid if you can afford it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i prefer  powdered; less expensive, easier to take along; you just get one of those little dispenser cups, avent makes a great one that can be a snack cup later, with the powder in it, and bottles with room temp water and mix only when you need it....and at home i have a 'dr brown's formula pitcher' and i can make 24hrs worth at once......

Ovulation usually occurs around the 14th day of your cycle (day one starts the same day as your last period).  Sperm can live inside a woman's vagina for 2-5 days when she is fertile.  To figure out what day of your cycle you ovulate on use a ovulation predictor kit (OPK).  You can also try monitoring your basal body temperature and cervical mucus.

You could wash and dress the top half of patients for other people on staff so all they had to do is come in and pull up the pants of your patients.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	You could try getting a job for a home health agency. You would actually be working at a patient's home rather than in a nursing home, where lifting would not be going on as much. I work for my in-laws who own a home health agency in the office, and I know that the home health aides (they're all CNAs) clean a bit for the patients, sometimes make them breakfast or lunch, and give them their meds. It's much easier than working in a facility! If you are anywhere near Omaha, NE, you could email me and I could help you out. =) If you live far away (which you most likely do), google "home health agencies" in your area and give them a call. Good luck! I'm glad you're taking care of your body so your baby can grow in a healthy way. <3|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Since you're probably familiar with the wording on charts, diagnosis', and what happens everyday on the job, see if there's any way your supervisor might transfer you to something like a ward clerk, where you do a lot of the filing of charts, coding, etc.  Also, see if there's any way to transfer you to something like janitorial work, where you wouldn't have the lifting, but they'd still have qualified person on staff.|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Is there anyway to be put on a medical leave by your doctor?  I'm an orthopedic nurse and not many of us manage to work too far into our pregnancies where I work, its just too physically demanding.<br>  <br>  Remember to take care of yourself.|`|SBeDh1f0aa	I am TTC and a CNA as well. It probably isn'ta  good idea to strain yourself! However, I worked with a pregnant women up til her 7th month! I tried to make it easy on her lol, cause lord knows I'd be worried about my baby! You can always get a job through Caregivers, or some other organization that pairs you with one person, and if you can't do alot of lifting or anything like that, they can match you with a client that has different needs. CNA is hard work! Especially if you work in a facility with lots of people, low staff, so more people for you! Check out Caregivers or something.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	i was a cna when i had a miscarriage too. i was about two months and it was so devastating i feel for you. you can have your doctor wright a note to your nurse manager and put you on light duty. maybe they can put you on the desk for a couple months. when you are out on the floor you are exposed to so much. like x-rays, people getting nuclear testing done, people on contact isolation. and that's just when you know what there sick with. i took care of many patients who didn't even tell us they were hiv positive. good luck.|`|TXB5wVlSaa	I would recommend speaking with your doctor.  If your doctor feels the risk is too great, then he/she can give you a note/letter for work stating your inability to do certain things, why, and for how long.  This way, you could still keep your job.  They can't fire you because you're pregnant or because you medically can't perform certain duties for a short time.  I'm a CMA and used to work for an ob/gyn.  We used to write notes all the time for people who needed to work with limitations.  Good luck!|`|xqqYXUNHaa	When pregnant with my first child, I was doing the same line of work and I requested light duty, due to my condition. They did not have any light duty available and this allowed me to obtain my unemployment benefits due to early pregnancy... I live in NJ I'm not sure if that differs from state to state, I am not at all trying to scare you, but these weeks are the most crucial ones of the pregnancy, they cannot obligate you to lift and you so early in pregnancy, request light duty asap... Then according to your options try to call unemployment ofc in your state and ask questions and explain your situation. Don't risk it... I didn't and will do all the same way if I had too. If you have to search for another job even cashier don't notify them that your expecting until a few months in...  May the LORD open doors and guide you to what's best ... :)
GWveqx61aa	well first you should take a prenatal, and try regularly for around 6 months, or if you dont want to wait you can go to the health store and try false unicorn root(havent tried but heard it works), soy iso flavones, take it like its clomid, cd3-7. vitex take daily, there are many things and you and the health store clerk can talk it over, they might have a fertility formula they prefer, and just becasuse you tried a year and a half dont mean something is wrong with you.it could have been your husband. it could just be you werent having sex at the right time, you should chart your cm starting now, and get familiar to when you ovulate, only have sex once in a period of 24 hours, he can take selenium and zinc to boost his sperm, and wear boxers,?~☆good luck☆~?
zXIDR1INaa	Just because you gain weight doesnt mean that weight is going to go to your baby.  Your baby will grow according to schedule.  If you are starting to dilated and you fear you might go into preterm labor you should speak with your doctor and possibly lower your activity level.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	Eat more...|`|8IrIYPBAaa	you are probably gaining enough weight even though it doesn't seem like it..i am 31w4d and due on may 5th and im only at 126lbs. i was also very small (less than 100lbs) when i became pregnant, and since then, the doctor said my weight gain chart looked very healthy..i am gaining the proper amount of weight in the right amount of time for someone my size! Just ask your doctor and they will be able to tell you if everything is normal! And, all that weight you are wanting to gain wont necessarily go to the baby either...good luck with everything and congrats and your little one!!!|`|JreuGwJYaa	you eating doesnt mean your baby will gain that weight. 25 lbs for 30 weeks is a good weight. I've gained 7 lbs and I'm 27 weeks. But what you really need to be worried about is your babys lung maturity. Thats why they dont want babys to be born before 35 weeks.|`|ZYS2E0dtaa	The best advise I can give you it to relax.  Just because you are dilated 1cm, does not mean you are going into labor any time soon.  I have had 3 children and each time I was dilated 1-2cm for weeks, so don't sweat it.  Your body will start having contractions from time to time, until you actually go into labor.  <br>  <br>  With my first child I did go into premature labor when my grandfather died.  I think I went into labor because I was so upset.  So I would suggest just calming down and if you are really concerned, call your doctor.  Don't just eat and eat, just because you are eating a lot doesn't mean that your baby is getting extra nourishment.  Think about women who have horrible morning sickness and barely eat for weeks (I would actually lose 10-15 pounds each time I got pregnant from being so sick from morning sickness).  My doctor assured my that my baby was fine and that my body knows what is doing.<br>  <br>  So I would recommend again to just relax the best you can and to eat really healthy foods, so you know your baby and you are getting all the vitamins and minerals it needs.  Lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein.  If you are having contractions, rest for a little bit and drink lots of water.  Being dehydrated can cause contractions.  But the best thing to do is call your doctor if you are really worried.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
uAnw9LAQaa	Ok first off dont kill yourself and tell your mom as soon as possible waiting will only make it worse, you need to look at all of your options. Abortion..which I highly disagree with, Adoption...in my opion your best option, or if you want to give up the rest of your life and also your parents to keep these babies. You did the right thing by getting medical attention now pleas for you own sake and the babies tell your parents! Good luck and dont listen to any of the negatives..people make mistakes and you learn from them and get stronger!|`|th45yP4Xaa	tell your mom in private.|`|byQDwPv8aa	Unfortunately, these things happen and hiding it isn't going to help. You need all the support you can get at such a crucial development time and your parents, although angry and disappointed at first, will come around and be glad you told them.|`|qJaKF24naa	I would start by telling whichever parent your feel closer to first or whichever is more laid back.. then they can break the news to the other one. Good luck and dont wait too long to tell them. Maybe consider giving the babies up for adoption since at 14 you cant really take care of them and provide what they need.|`|kkhJH6k2aa	abortion.<br>  <br>  go to a planned parenthood and get the info. you don't need to have parental consent as far as I know. <br>  <br>  do it before it's too late or you get a case of conscience. if you don't want them don't have them. you shouldn't have to live with the mistake if you don't want to.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Sit them down and tell them that you are pregnant.

At first my parents totally freaked, but hello... its obvious you know they are going to.  Just know that the initial reaction, is what it is, an initial reaction.  My sister is now twenty five and has another baby, just as precious.  She stayed in school and even got her college degree, there are so many programs to help out teen moms.  This is your choice so don't let anyone sway your decision.  Just know that whatever choice you make, keeping the babies, abortion, or adoption, there are choices and people willing to help, you just have to help yourself by going out there and doing it.  You made a grown up decision and had sex, now you have to make another grown up choice.  Good luck and know your not alone.|`|Z76VC9Rjaa	Prettyyy weird... Well that happens when girls want to have sex  and they don't think about the consequences. How about if you get a job and your boyfriend too. Wait until your belly is showing and tell your parents there's nothing you can do and I don't thin abortion is an option you have to deal with what you did.|`|DsvT9jJ4aa	well sweetheart its going to be ok...Its a mistake u made and there are options...you can abort or u can adopt or u can have it...eaither way u will be fine...tell your mum and dad and yes they will be cross but if u dont want to atleast tell a close friend that u trust and only tell you mum and dad if u choose to keep it..If u choose to abort just do it and dont tell...WHat they dont know wont hurt them...But your very younge so whatever choice u make i wish u all the very best...and also dont listen to people like that f'n idiot that wrote that first comment ok xoxox|`|fPxxAgNSaa	I do believe that it's the guy that's supposed to use the condom on his peepee, and not the girl over her head.

Since you are so close, keep in mind all the things you love about her, and that whatever it is shouldn't change the respect and friendship that you have. If she is gay, so what?

O954jjpcaa	No easy answer. You are probably done.  Lots of people get the on again off again phenomenon, but usually, once it has been gone for a couple days or more, it is gone.  Sometimes, it will come and go for a couple more days, but it sounds like you are at the end.<br>  <br>  As for the discharge, this could signify that you are restarting ovulation, but it can also just be discharge.

My daughter is now 8mths and i still havnt got my period back.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	Likely not ovulating yet if you're breastfeeding, but theoretically possible.  It is very normal to have this pattern of bleeding/discharge for up to 6 weeks.  Beyond that, it could mean retained placental tissue and you should see your doctor... you'll get an ultrasound to check.<br>  <br>  If you have any signs of increasing pain, increasing bleeding, clots, foul smell/discharge, fever, then see your doctor right away.
sIr2fWh6aa	I'm completely Pro-Life and I agree.  I feel that people (especially YOUNG KIDS) are having unprotected sex because they "forget to use protection" or "they don't care" and then run get Plan B just to end the pregnancy before it has a real chance to start.. Therefore, killing off any potential baby that is trying to attach.|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	I don't think plan B is anyone's ticket to just have unprotected sex.  When used properly it is used if your birth control fails.  Therefore, I don't believe it's like an abortion pill.  We already have an abortion pill that does terminate pregnancies, and that's RU486.  Plan B cannot terminate a pregnancy that has already begun to flourish in the uterus.<br>  <br>  That being said, unfortunately not all women are smart, are still having unprotected sex and depending on plan B to come to the rescue.  It's very sad.|`|AA10529334	Its not a fetus or viable until implantation - get your facts straight.|`|JITTMjasaa	I think that any time you terminate a pregnancy it is killing a little human, plan B included. I see it as God giving you this wonderful gift and you throwing it back in his face. It is not right but I do believe that women should have a choice. I can't say that having a baby when your not ready is fair to the child (sometimes it is such torture they actually wish they had never been born). I think that people just need to have better morals ie. don't have sex if your not ready, always wear a condom, only abort if you were raped/too young/a risk to yourself or baby's health, have sex for love not popularity/money/acceptance/out of spite/to get off/or some weird fetish, and love yourself and one another. We all deserve better than this, so why do we keep hurting each other?|`|wUVUXHZtaa	Plan B cannot terminate an existing pregnancy, therefore it does not cause an abortion. <br>  Off topic....Now that they are advertising Plan B, I think more women are going to use and abuse it. Which is dumb, you can pay the same amount to get birth control for an entire month as the 2 pills you are given with Plan B.|`|eTPJNcilaa	No abortion is ending an already existing pregnancy. Plan B simply stops a pregnancy from happening. I do think that people may abuse the Plan B pill now that it is more readily available. Hopefully people will be smart and remember that STDs are on the rise and condoms need to be used.|`|AtLP7QwMaa	I feel like plan b is like an abortion pill just like the mini pill they stop a fertilized egg from attaching.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	From the time you have sex until the time the fertilized egg implants in your uterus is DAYS.

HoonZJMgaa	Spotting can be a sign of placenta previa or placental abruption as well as many other things. I suggest you returning to labor and delivery so they can check you out. If they cannot figure out why you are bleeding or spotting, you should go on bed rest as much as possible. Sometimes we as mothers have to know what's best way before our babies are born.

tivpa7Vlaa	i hate to confirm the pain is one of a kind. well there are things that happened b4 active labor starts(thats the bad part) but bleeding,bad cramping,bearable contractions etc. so its not like the more un-bearable pains start first..dont't worry it wont just sneak up on you. for me i was doing my long walks to activate labor and the day b4 my due date and i felt a squirt of water in my crotch area and believe it or not i was so so happy cause i knew it was over and i am finally gonna meet baby. i called my mid wife and she advised me to go home,shower,have a nice dinner and come into the hospital cause i wasnt feeling any type of pains. i admitted and just waited to see what my body would do..all nite just like period cramps, then bleeding, more water. by 9am my due date they gave me some poticin to help bring on my contractions. O..M..G! the cramping got worst, then it was contractions every 5 then 2 then 1minute apart. so by 4:10pm i finally got epidural and i thought ahhh yess i can get a little sleep..nope! i started feeling the baby moving down toward my hole..this is where i was feeling very very scared cause i know the nitemare of pushing was coming. by 5pm i was pushing and he was born by 5:22pm. my mid wife sniped me a little cause someone told me its better to get cut than to rip so i told my nurse if she knew i was gonna rip just cut me and she did. i got a little bit of stitches not a lot. baby cried for the first time  and it was just an amazing moment in life. after baby comes out you feel so revived...like energy came from nowhere. i felt like i could run a marathon. first two month with baby is very tough...like you couldn't imagine how it feels to cater to baby all day and nite with absolutely days of no sleep. now baby is 3mths and its alot easier baby sleeps for 11 hrs probably wake for 1bottle or pamper. now its better. well have a safe delivery and the best of luck|`|8d76f8b8e5f5db785811fc316c86ca44aa	Nature takes over...but it will be very painful.  But what a great experience.  Just keep an open mind and don't expect anything just go with the flow.  You will be fine...more than fine.  Then you will have a great story to tell other moms-to-be!|`|WvWFmwQoaa	OMG lol i feel the same way exactly the same im a first time mum and iam so scared im 34w & 5d and i think i might go a couple of weeks early but iam already packed and ready as much as i really don't want to go through all the labour pains and stuff i want to hold her but get her out in a much less painful way (carnt think of any way possible lmao) but i just wanted to say that your not the only one feeling like this lol i am feeling the same as you SCARED OUT OF MY BRAIN :( and all day and all night i think about it because people have also told me that is it going to hurt like HELL... <br>  well i just wanted to say your not the only one out there lol :) good luck and i hope everything goes well :) congrats|`|nlKZRNqmaa	Don't stress too much. When your body is ready you will know. Everybody is different...you might get contractions first without your water breaking or vice versa. You might have to be induced... so many things could happen. Luckily your OB should have an after hours line you can call with any concerns you have. It is painful... but you will live through it. There are different ways to deal with the pain.. including an epidural (which I have had twice and is great). In the end when you see your baby all the pain and work will be worth it. Good Luck!|`|8IrIYPBAaa	i think this is normal for every women..I am due in about 8 weeks and getting nervous more and more as each day goes by! I have wondered some of the same questions you have..they say that when your labor comes, you will know..also, if your water breaks, you should NOT wait to go to the hospital, go immediately. well i cant give you a labor story because im waiting to see what its like myself!  Good Luck hun!|`|AA12383391	its normal to feel excited and scare at the same time. considering this is your first one too. my friend totally forgot how scary delivery was for her 2nd kid until her last week of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  so the answers to your questions. i dont have a kid, but from what i know.<br>  you go into labor when you're dilated more than i think 9 cm or so?<br>  contractions happens slowly, when they are not closely coming, you can wait a bit, because if you go to the hospital too early, they will sometimes send you back home until you are closer to labor. i believe my friend went to the hospital when her contractions where like 5 mins apart, because it comes faster and sooner after awhile. <br>  <br>  i hope those helped you a bit. im not an expert, but thats what i know from what she told me=) i know everyone reacts differently! CONGRATULATION on your baby!! GOOD LUCK!|`|FLAtdWrmaa	When do you go to the hospital?  You need to discuss this with your doctor!<br>  <br>  You certainly and immediately call or go to the doctor when your waters break, and TELL HIM/HER that your waters broke.  Let the doctor give you direction from there.<br>  <br>  If your uterus no longer has the amniotic fluid around your baby, this could trigger the baby to try to breathe.  This is not what you want to happen when you're not even in labor!!  There's nothing there for the baby to breathe in, except his/her own wastes (called "mecomium").  Even if you are rushed into an emergency C-section (and your baby is born even full-term and otherwise healthy), once the kid has mecomium in the lungs, there is little the doctors can do to save your baby's life.<br>  <br>  This didn't happen to me or anyone I know:  there was a woman on the obstetric floor who lost her son this way -- her waters broke, she went to her weekly doctor's visit and never told him about it, and didn't go into labor until a week after the waters broke.  I thought at the time it was pretty cruel of the hospital to keep her on the obstetric ward, where she could see and hear living babies constantly.<br>  <br>  Regarding pain:  there is absolutely no way to predict how "comfortable" you will feel -- at any stage of labor and delivery.  As a base, just think of labor as the most strenuous and demanding athletic event you'll ever undergo.  And, unlike, say, marathon races or iron-man competitions, you can't stop in the middle if you feel you must.  It may or may not be actually painful for you, but it will almost certainly take everything you've got!<br>  <br>  If you do have pain, don't be afraid to use pain-reducing drugs, or relaxants.  The modern ones have been thoroughly tested, and the chances of mishap are really very small.<br>  <br>  And congratulations!|`|FncCxdu7aa	Well my labor lasted 2 hours with my son. I had no real warning signs other than i had to pee really bad but i couldn't and ended falling off the toilet from a contraction. that was at 9:00AM got to the hospital at 9:20AM had my son at 11:45AM same day i had an epesiotomy not sure how to spell it (the cut the vagina so it doesn't rip) and they had to use a suction cup. my son was also 9 lb 7.6 ounces that why it was hard to get him out, my labor went fast because i was 16.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	I was scared of the delivery with both of my daughters. Im sure if we plan to have another Ill be scared about that one too. I knew labor really started when the contractions I was having hurt and continually got worse. Its a feeling like youve never had and you will know when it comes, unless your water breaks first then thats when your labor starts. You should go to the hospital when your water breaks and have them check you. they will send you home if youre not dilated enough. go to the hospital when your contractions are about 5 mins apart. <br>  <br>  I gave birth the first time with an epidural and the second time with an epidural that completely wore off before it was time to push. Childbirth is painful but I forgot it the next day. The pain is worth it in the end. Congratulations to you! You will do fine. Your body was made for this and your instincts will tell you everything.|`|l0J5vd0Haa	it is pretty scary but dont forget there are lots of pain relief options available. there is a book called labour of love and another called birth skills which have some really great ideas for dealing with the labour and the pain. if your waters break you should go to hospital and if the dont but the contrations become 5 min then you should also go to hospital. if you are ever unsure, call your dr or the midwives at the hospital, they deal with first time mums every day and dont feel dumb for asking! i was on first name basis with lots of the midwives at the hospital before i had my daughter!!!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	You will know it's started because contraction will start and they won't go away, they will get closer together until you feel the need to push. I wouldn't go to the hospital until you are three minutes apart. if you go sooner it can stall your labor; being in an unfamiliar place, all the lights and sounds the monitor (you can refuse it no matter what they say) and people trying to tell you what to do. I would bring a house dress or night gown to labor in, you won't want to be put in a gown. I wouldn't describe my labor as painful just very intense. You will be fine, just remember once you go through labor and delivery you feel like you can do anything because of what you just accomplished. I would also suggest getting a doula. Check out www.dona.org  A  doula is a knowledgeable, experienced companion – who stays with you through labor and birth. They will help you stay calm and focused, the hospital staff will not sit and hold your hand through every contraction or give you praise or help you find comfortable position or have very helpful suggestions. If you are that nervous about this event you should definitely have a doula.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	I want to have kids and am so scared about labor also.....but it helps a little to look at everyone around and be like if they can do i can do it haha
vACBeHSfaa	You can see cervical mucus again at the end of the cycle.  It is usually because your progesterone is dropping.  Progesterone is what dries up or thickens your cervical mucus.  Once it stops being produced, you can see some of that mucus again.  Unfortunately, it probably means your period is on its way.  Sorry!  :(  I know that it sucks.<br>  <br>  How long is your cycle usually?  I would wait to test again until around Tuesday if you still haven't started.  I hate wasting money on pregnancy tests, so I usually add a day or two.  Good luck & I hope you get your ++++ soon!!!!

qHwI9ev8aa	Since my first will be 2 1/2 by the time the second arrives we're reusing furniture. I didn't get anything too cutesy or gender specific so I would be able to reuse it. Getting hand-me-down stuff doesn't make your second baby less special, it just proves you are fiscally wise parents.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I only have my first child right now, but so long as it isn't several years in between, I will totally reuse the furniture.  However, we only have two bedrooms in our condo, so unless we sell this place and buy a new one, they'll have to share a room anyway...and it's not like we could fit a second set of furniture in our room.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I got a new crib for the second baby, and had to buy some stuff new bc my sons stuff was hand me downs and it broke since he is now 2 1/2 years old. I saved all my sons clothes though they were all brand new and I took very good care of them so this baby will use all of his old baby clothes. I plan on passing down the high chair. I'm all for saving money, if you dont have to buy it why do it then??|`|cEgI5ogLaa	Yes we are planning to reuse almost everything (needing a few new things like stroller, high chair, bath matt ect) but mostly re-using the things bought for my daughter. I got pregnant when she was only 7 months old and having another girl so it actually works out really well! Everything is still like new because babies don't really do a whole lot of damage to things so yes we plan to reuse! <br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Toni Lynne|`|7geLpG6Oaa	Reused everything except the high chair. I tossed it out when we moved to a smaller place because it was huge. I found one on clearance for $25 though. My daughter also wears hand me downs from my son. I figure they are babies and they'll never know. no big deal.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	reused all the furniture. it was all unisex (the stroller, jumper, swing, bouncer and crib) because we didnt know what we were having the first time.<br>  <br>  plus, if its all in great shape why not?|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i half to but everything again (not new) i solid my sons stuff|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	I reused  each of my furniture pieces seeing as my boys are 22 months apart. We just went over each piece to look for needed repairs and added a few extra touches to the furniture for our 2nd son. We also plan on reusing the toddler bed. The saved money can be used on other expenses in the household.Good luck~|`|WGCa811vaa	We reused everything.  I saved it all, I knew we were going to have more kids.  I did get a new highchair because my first one was a hand-me-down and had seen better days but that was all I bought for the second one.|`|ZMMHNnuUaa	why would you buy all new furniture ...unless it is damaged...my sister is about to have her second baby and she is using the same crib...basinet and changing table with the new baby as she used on her 16 month old...hope this helped|`|385e84e81fffdd40bacfb06c4579774aaa	i reused everything from clothes to crib since my girls were only 18 months apart but after being used twice i am going to buy all new stuff this time around|`|c9sXhnKpaa	Well babies are expensive enough without the added expense of buying new furniture for them too, so if I were you I would re-use all your first baby`s stuff for the second baby.
cEXzXkqnaa	Why don't you contact an adoption agency like Gladney Center for Adoption  in NY|`|bo4MguzVaa	Adopt me!!!<br>  <br>  I would think with all the babies that get stuck in foster care, that they outta give one to a stable and independent woman.  Who better to raise another productive member of sociciety? <br>  <br>  More power to ya!
ntdGOZqGaa	No not all women breast get bigger. Breast size has nothing to do with breast feeding a baby unless they are too big and baby cant breathe. When you get your milk in your boobs will get somewhat bigger from that too. Good luck|`|hAuemuWTaa	Not at all i am on my third pregnancy and with all i didn't get much change in my breast and with the two children that are here now i successfully breast fed my babies. I can't speak for the third as it not born yet( 4 wks to go yeah!). <br>  So don't worry, if u have trouble at breast feeding than there is specialist out there to help u solve the problem.|`|vygYFdsSaa	It shouldn't. Not all women experiencing a dramatic change in their breasts.|`|ZXFg6D16aa	mine became big after i gave birth and started breastfeeding!|`|1U7yLEf9aa	No. lol they WILL get bigger once you start breast feeding. BELIEVE me...|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	nope mine were the same and i nursed for 16 months
vygYFdsSaa	Very early symptoms are rare, but not unheard of. Those symptoms however could be attributed to any number of things, so try not to worry until you miss your period. Best of luck x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes you can. I started getting symptoms with my current pregnancy at 3 weeks or a week after conception.|`|eoV0NWjSaa	WOOO the little girls growin up! was this the first time you had unprotected sex? if yea, congrats! ok yea i think you're pregnant congrats! who's the daddy? send me a pic ok kiddo?|`|af2e80262205de82271aa1bc92cd7775aa	unprotected sex is NOT the way to go
4hxgRpBIaa	Aw, I'm due in July too ^_^<br>  Anyway, I would hold off on the sex until you can ask your doctor about it. It may just be a small infection, but you never know... It could be something else. Better safe than sorry is what I say! ^_^<br>  Also, before I was pregnant (like a year or two before) I would have similar types of pain and it ended up being something with my cervix which is why I say wait until the doctor okays it...<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!! I hope it works out =P|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It could be infection. Have you brought this up to your doctor? You really should.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	The discharge is normal. Try using a lubrication. I've been using lube since I was around 8 weeks.|`|AA10458750	It may be a yeast infection (which is super common during pregnancy)with the burning & stinging symptoms, ask your Dr. to do a swab test a find out....you don't want to go through labor having an infection! The dryness is another lovely effect of the pregnancy, water will help! Drink a full glass or two before you intend on gettign busy, it should help.|`|vWb8fquvaa	It could be painful because you are swollen from all the hormones. <br>  <br>  Discharge is always funky while pregnant.<br>  <br>  You can try a water based lubricant to help out with the dryness. But check with your OB before using it.|`|LkgrqlKXaa	Use a water based lube. You can get a generic brand that doesn't have any oils in it and ask your partner not to go to deep. If you're dry it's gonna hurt.
vygYFdsSaa	Gotta love morning sickness!!!! You'll probably start vomiting eventually, be happy you haven't gotten to that point yet... and also count yourself lucky I've been extremely constipated my whole pregnancy|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's pregnancy. :) This is all normal.|`|MwcNwpIvaa	It's called morning sickness. But it can last all day. It's just a part of pregnancy for some people, especially in the beginning. It won't last forever [although it may seem that way] and you have nothing to worry about.|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	I had it all the time, I was feeling like I was gonna throw up and I never did... in the beginning of Pregnancy. it is worse than actual nausea as when you throw up you end up feeling better but like this a feeling just does not go away... once or twice I even made myself throw up as I was so fed up with it. It will pass eventually or will grow in to a real nausea :)<br>  about going number 2 often trust me you are lucky some women dont get to go number two like even once a week during pregnancy so just enjoy :)|`|p4R1c6fraa	Join the mommy club....you're going to love it!!! I'm 17 weeks and still throwing up.The first problem you have I had in the beginning but it should get under control.Your body is just doing it's thing.I hope you feel better soon enough though.Congratulations on the pregnancy!!!!|`|pJ7icz0taa	It's called MORNING SICKNESS!!!  Nothing to worry about.|`|AA10500537	you may have a touch of stomach flu just rest  and if you don;t feel better see a dr.|`|U1gGAStKaa	hahaha you sound like me LOL!! I know exactly how you feel, im 11 weeks and still feel the same and it started at 5 weeks. PPL keep saying keep your fibre up or you'll get constipated and Im thinking if I have any more fibre I will need to carry a bucket around. LOL I have been throwing up so much and gagging at most foods and smells and even throwing up if I drink my drink to quick or have too much. It sucks, Im kinda adjusting but its so hard. The good thing this week is I havent woken up feeling sick as a dog, it takes a few mins to kick in :) plus still have most of pregnancy symptoms. The tired thing has been so bad, especially at work I swear if I dont blink fast enough I will go to sleep standing up. I have been resting so much and havent cleaned the house for 6 weeks. Hubby helps though LOL! COngrats on being pregnant with your second and I wish you all the best of luck and hope all goes well :)  I am feeling your symptoms it sucks I know :) take care and put your feet up!|`|O954jjpcaa	Totally normal.  Do not worry.  Some people get that horrible feeling  like bad motion sickness for weeks. I hope for you that it doesn't last long.  I get horrible nausea from the start and it lasts for 20 weeks.  The pooping problem is lousy too.  I get constipated for a week, then have horrible diarrhea, then back again.  Good luck!|`|qmaRcGA3aa	I was like that at week six too. Its normal. I am 11weeks and still havent thrown up. Its normal to feel like u want to gag.... Ha good luck|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Yup. Thats how it is during the 1st trimester. The key is to keep something small on your stomach at all times. Drink ginger ale and eat saltine crackers or ginger snaps.|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Morning sickness! ...The name is just a decoy, it happens all-day, every-day for me!|`|vWb8fquvaa	Welcome to pregnancy. Congrats!|`|XqzH0l0Maa	sounds normal. stool softner?|`|NXzWu2QAaa	It sounds like its just the beginning of morning sickness.  Those symptoms are exactly what i had when i found out i was prego,  actually its how i knew!
eYs8DpbBaa	If you want to talk to her about growing up talk to her like a grown up. If she has questions tell her how you felt at her age. All those things must be scary for a young woman.

Tell her the best of your knowlege and you should be great!|`|LRbcznGxaa	when I was ten they made all the girls and boys go into two different rooms for sex education.

O3EtP4vOaa	I am not familiar w/ the implant but ovulating and having your period are not the same thing.  When you ovulate it is generally around 2 weeks before your perios starts.  You have a egg white discharge around this time, followed by @ two weeks later your period.  So if you had the implant removed a few weeks ago I would say you are probably ovulating or having a hormone change and you will have your period about 2 weeks from now (roughly).  The spotting you had was probably just due to the implant being removed, you could have spotting at random times while your hormones regulate themselves.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would call and ask your doctor. Have sex to cover yourself in case you are ovulating but call and ask your doc.|`|YNH2fmYWaa	its possible youre ovulating. your period will follow approximately 2 weeks after, if you are currently ovulating.<br>  <br>  might as well just have sex every other day and hope for the best!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|vWb8fquvaa	Ovulation comes first, then your period.
HLKb961Qaa	It's designed to be inserted into the vagina, close to the opening of your cervix, where the sperm will be after ejaculation. It's made to be similar to the mucous that comes with ovulation, so it creates a simulated environment to help the sperm stay viable and swim more effectively to hopefully increase the chances of pregnancy.

I was on bedrest from the time I was like 25 weeks or so :-[ And, then spent a month in the hospital before delivering. <br>  <br>  The night before I had her the nurse called the dr in because, her heart wasn't accelerating. So, the next morning it was the samething... so, they did a biophysical profile first thing... she wasn't moving, practicing breathing, and her heart still wasn't accelerating. They took me back for an emergency c-section... they even had to open another OR  up just for me. She was really gray and small when she came out.

They gave me the medicine to make me contract at 8 am broke my water at 10 am and I had her a 1:26 pm. I'm currently 26 weeks and hope this labor will be as easy as the last one.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the Baby and Hope all goes well with your labor. I pray you can make it a few more weeks.|`|CMQnJhodaa	With my daughter I was induce at 39 weeks and had a c~sec after laboring for almost 18hrs!!, Maddy was 5p11oz  and she is now 8!! <br>  <br>  I had my son at 35 weeks and was normal delivery this labor was 2h22min, He is only 20 days old and weighed 4p 10oz!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck with the rest of your pregnancy and I'd be soaking in the 'bed rest' while you can!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck<br>  <3 k|`|8XqzxKz9aa	First of all sweetie everyone goes different. There are many obstacles and stages that come into play when a women goes into labor. Is this your first child? Why are you on bed rest? Did you mother have children early? These are all things to think about. <br>  <br>  For myself, I was induced at 37 weeks due to complications. However, when I went in to get induced, I was already 4 cm dilated and 90% effaced. They gelled me at 7:30 am and nothing happened for 3 hours. They gelled me again at 10:30 and still nothing happened. At 3:30 they gelled me again and put potassium in my IV and I went from a 4 cm to a 10cm in a matter of 30 minutes!!!! I screamed for the drugs, they gave them to me and it stop everything!!!! They still had me push but I was not contracting anymore to help the baby along. Well after 3 hours of pushing I finally had my son. He was born 7 pm. So over all I was in labor I guess form 3 and half hours. But I was induced, from the first gel to the end it was 12 hours. <br>  <br>  I read loads of books when I was on bed rest!!! Also I got into TV shows that you could watch online for free. ABC.com has loads of great TV shows. I know its hard and keep up the good work! OH I also made alot of baby blankets! That was totally fun and helpful when the baby came! <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!!|`|7geLpG6Oaa	I had my son at 36wks 2day due to severe preeclampsia. Was already in labor when I got to the hospital. Labored for 12-14hours before having an emergncy c-section due to my deteriorating condition. My daughter was born via repeat c-section, 3 days before he due date. I think she would have camped out in there, she was comfy.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	40 weeks and it was a 12 hour labor the first time and 37 weeks and I dont know how long the labor was total. I got to the hospital at 9am and had my baby at 1145 the second time. I only had to push 20 mins the first time and 15 the second.|`|vFkFQQBAaa	With both my children between 40 and 41 weeks. <br>  It must be difficult to be on bedrest but follow doctors orders. That will insure the best outcome for you and the baby.<br>  How many weeks along are you right now?? Hope the time goes by fast and soon you'll be enjoying your new baby....|`|lxJoXNZwaa	I delivered on my exact due date - which was my mother's birthday too.  So my mom said that my daughter (her granddaughter) was her greatest birthday present ever!!  I was in labor for over 24 hours.  It was long - but I would do it all over again in a heartbeat!!|`|qHwI9ev8aa	I was induced at 41 weeks + 1 day. Labour lasted 14 hours. <br>  <br>  You poor thing being on bedrest!

How far along are you?|`|0DLelfkyaa	I havent ever had a baby... im not even married but anyways my sister is in the hospital right now and so today is the 6th she is due on the 16th and so my little niece will be most likely 9 days early!|`|OfLyP6mgaa	My son was born at 39 weeks, 2 days. I was in stage 1 of labor from Sunday until Tuesday afternoon, then had my son Wednesday morning. I pushed for 2 hours, 45 mins :(|`|UseJjREjaa	I had my first son at 36 weeks 3 days and he was 5 lbs 8 oz.. he was 18.5 inches long and had a 8/9 apgar and was perfectly healthy.  Born after 4 pushes!  only 15 minutes of pushing.<br>  <br>  Then I had my twin boys at 36 weeks exactly and they were 4 lbs 6 oz and 4 lbs 8 oz.. Which was very very good because they were also 18.5 inches and had 8/9 apgar scored.. All my boys were perfectly healthy...Especially since I only gained 18 lbs during the twin pregnancy!  <br>  Born after 4 and 2 pushes... 5 minutes apart and the bigger baby (baby B was breach)  But still healthy vag. birth!<br>  <br>  The twins are now 2 months old and already weigh 11lbs!!!  So good luck to ya n don't worry!<br>  <br>  With my first labor was 9 hrs and I had an epidural..<br>  With the twins I was in labor for a lil over ONE hour.  I was pushing when I got there so no epidural!  That sucked birthing twins with NO PAIN MEDS!  Ha ha.. for twins they treated me good.. no stretch marks, no pain meds, no nothing..

Wjdpm4xNaa	Hi, this is the best pic I have of my son where you can see the buds in his gums...it's kind of blurry though so I dont know how well you can see them...After seeing this pic I realized his teeth were coming through...<br>  He was 5 months here<br>  <a href="http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2413/66/60/508045184/n508045184_2657800_3008987.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...</a>|`|n6XYYyoLaa	it is fairly common to happen at 3 mos or even before, so if the symptoms are there....my dd CUT her first at ten weeks exactly, has been a rabid drooling monkey since, with symptoms other than that coming and going in cycles with no others showing through, although they do usually swell up...she's nine mos now...weird, huh?|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Are you noticing top teeth or bottom teeth? I wish I had a picture uploaded but I don't It's at home on the laptop.<br>  <br>  Just for info, the bottom teeth were difficult to recognize until it actually broke through, but when the second bottom tooth came in I started tor ecognize a little bit of swelling where the gum was obviously up a little higher that the rest of the unteethed(?!) gums.<br>  <br>  The top teeth were super obvious. You know like Han Solo's frozen body from Star Wars? The top teeth literally seemed pushed out rom the gums above the gum line where they break through. You could run your finger up there and feel the bumps of tooth. And it moved down until it came in. The other top teeth on the outside of the front two did the same thing.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 8 months old and already has 5 teeth. You may notice sleep pattern changes, and my daughter does a signature rub of her nose/upper lip area a lot when her teeth are bothering her. That's my sign to give medicine or teething tablets. At 3 months my daughter just drooled like mad crazy and 6 months came tooth #1|`|ki5hZbcTaa	I don't have a pic but what does that mean? My 7 month old just got 3 teeth and it's like the very top of it is poking thru and it's really sharp!|`|TJusfEnlaa	here is one of my son right before the two bottom teeth erupted<br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1420268&l=0f3de&id=688351377" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=14...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ps. he was about 5 months when this pic was taken|`|MeYILJeSaa	I wish someone would answer this! My son is 3.5 months and I was wondering the same thing. I tried to search for pictures, but no luck. :(
4sjW4Ig5aa	As suggested, positive reenforcement is a beautiful tool at your disposal. There's more to it than just stickers and rewards. Kids hear so many No's, Stop's, Don't's, etc. that they start to tune them out. Try phrasing things positively. Please walk inside. Sit nicely in the chair. Use your inside voice. etc. <br>  <br>  Follow that up with praise for a task well done. ie. I like how gently you pet the puppy. Thank you for using your table manners. What a great job you did picking up your toys. Your getting to be such a big boy!<br>  <br>  At this age he is craving his independence. And why not? He's nearly a whopping 5 yrs old! lol. Let him make decisions when possible. Be careful with this one though. Don't offer him choices that you aren't willing to accept. Also keep the number of choices down to 2 or 3, any more than that, and it can become confusing. For example, instead of, "What would you like to wear today?" ask "Would you like to wear the blue shirt or the red one?"<br>  <br>  Besides positive reenforcement, try and let the punishment fit the crime. Made a mess? Clean it up. Ripped up a book? Instead of taping it back together, throw it away. Help him understand that his actions have consequences. <br>  <br>  Most important, say what you mean, mean what you say. Threats are meaningless.<br>  <br>  Have patience and good luck!|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	Give him a choice,You can put your toys a way or i will throw them away.<br>  <br>  What i do with my daughter she will bring toys out in the living room and when she is done she thinks i should have to put them away.So one day i told her alright you can put them away or im gonna throw them away.She said throw em away.So i got a clean trash bag and started putting them in it. She screamed and cried taking one toy out of the bad at a time taking them to her room.<br>  <br>  Just an example.But i give my kids choices 1 good one one bad one.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I would take things away, games, toys tv time whatever I would take it away. But i wouldnt just give it back to him either he would have to earn it back by listening to you and doing what he is suppose to . I think 5 years old is old enough to understand completely and time outs dont work they barely work on my 2 1/2 yr old. Good luck|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	At this age, positive reinforcement works well.  Make a behavior chart for him and most importantly you have to be consistent and follow through everytime.  Start by making it a little easy at first then  harder, little by little.  It can start with he gets 5 points if he picks up all his toys or clothes.  If he gets 15 points you reward him.  Then you make it a little harder, like 25 points and so forth.  You don't have to spend money on this.  Kids his age are happy with little trinkets from the 99 cents store or by telling him he has earned a cookie at snack time.   You will see the difference he will want to be good.  Don't reward him until he deserves it.<br>  <br>  Also, he might throw a tantrum at first, but DO NOT give in,  he has to go through this.  He is not use to being disciplined this way, but be patient.  If he cries or kicks or gets angry, then oh well.  Just walk away from him until he calms down and does what he has to do.  Remember that as strong willed as he is, he needs discipline and you are the parent, he is the child.  Don't let him forget that.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	You can simply take the things that he likes the most like a favorite game and take them away, but not for a a few hours but for a day or so, put it in your room where he can't get at it.  You can also have him do lil chores and things when he acts out, saying okay well then if you have all this energy to why don't you help me clean the table.  And those sort of things...|`|OI3bf4yjaa	For taking the toys away, don't give in. If you take them away, you take them away. If he makes a big deal out if it .. tough. He needs to earn the toys back. As for timeouts.. have you tried sitting him in a corner? That works wonders! If NONE of those things work.. that's when I would resort to spanking. I may get a lot of thumbs down for this, but a light tap on the bum will make him realize that you're not playing games.. and that you need him to listen.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	He is thinking the wrong thing of course. Tell him that if he doesn't stop you will ground him for a month. No toys and no TV for one week. If he starts crying ignore that is how they learn. Don't ever give in to him. Here is a secret about toddlers they think that if they cry parents will give them what they want.
ntdGOZqGaa	He is 6 he understands about a baby coming into your guys life. I would just explain to him that you are ok and the baby will be fine. And just brag on him about how he is going to be the best big brother in the world. Maybe you guys could spend more time together like playing board games or cards. Or maybe even watch cartoons together or watch movies. Give extra hugs and kisses I dont think there can ever be too many of those. Good luck and congrats|`|46StihsPaa	Let him sit in bed with you! Watch TV together if you have a TV in your room and talk a lot. Ask him about what he'll do when he's a big brother. He's in school isn't he? If he is arrange lots of play dates with his friends from school or his neighborhood friends (ask the moms to pick and drop because your pregnant and having a tough time, they'll understand) Get him to read and tell you stories always ask about his day. <br>  <br>  Basically talk with him a lot and spend more time together. He'll appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the new child (and the older one) =D|`|ki5hZbcTaa	does he attend school at all? When he's home, have him camp out in the living room or other common area so you guys can spend time together. Read books to each other, watch your favorite cartoons. Have him play games with you. It shouldn't be too difficult. Good luck with him and your new baby!|`|ePhsBJE5aa	you should  breast feed your child even if you are sick or anything like that, if you wont give him/her milk he may suffer in future .hope this may help|`|WiveFaO3aa	Take a Grammar class with him that should be fun!|`|4XypeG1daa	im pretty sure he doesnt come out six years old
AA12383391	from my understanding, heavy bleeding is normal to a certain degree only. when you say heavy, if its only a little bit heavier than your regular period then its normal, but if you need to change your pad every hour or less there is a problem. your body is pushing out all the baby stuff out of the system. good luck! and drink lots of fluid, it helps!!|`|T3OGT4Ntaa	A lot of crazy things can happen after an abortion.  Did they not tell you what to expect?  You might want to go to a walk-in clinic just to get some real medical advice.|`|uLlwcUbsaa	Maybe call your doctor and ask. Especially if it gets worse.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would call the clinic back and ask them if that's normal. I'm not sure but it sounds like something they would know for sure.|`|S4DNQkFraa	I've never had one, but you're suppose to bleed heavily because your body is ridding it of the baby and all that. If the bleeding stays heavy and you feel woozy and or light headed, you should probably go in. G/L...I guess....I'm pro-life, but as you stated, it's your choice.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	I had one about 7 years ago, and i got very heavy bleeding, it is normal, dont stress if it persists for longer than a period then go to the ER or to a doctor, or even back to the hospital to let them know whats going on, dont worry if anyone says some mean stuff to you in answers, ignore them its not worth it, and like you said its your choice.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	You can have blood clots that will cause the opening of your cervix to be blocked causing little or no bleeding.  When this happens you may have to do the procedure again.  If you are getting it heavier now this may be what happened.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	I would go see an Ob/Gyn in private practice...NOT Planned Parenthood. Sometimes heavy bleeding after abortion can cause death. So get checked out just to be sure!!!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	As long as you don't go through more than 4 pads in an hour you should be okay. If in doubt call the clinic. What kind of abortion did you get?
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Hmm Im not sure that your doctor would be able to tell whether or not your pregnant if you are only 2 months along. At 2 months along your uterus would still be behind your pelvic bone in some cases. Your doctor wouldnt be able to tell you accurately whether or not you are pregnant just based on feeling your stomach. <br>  As time goes on during pregnancy your uterus moves upwards, and your doctor could definitely be able to tell if you were further along then 2 months. <br>  When you are only 2 months along, the only real accurate ways your doctor could confirm a pregnancy is through either ultra sound or a blood test. <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	seems to me that a simple blood or urine test would prove you are or are not pregnant.  relying on feeling the uterus alone doesnt prove anything.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If you were 2 months pregnant the doctor would know. It's their job. Also, your uterus grows during pregnancy.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	I'm guessing your doc reduced his statement down to 'layman's terms' or what the average women (that would be us!) would understand:  when he said your uterus was "small", he prob meant that it was the normal size, which is smaller than a gestating uterus---even one that's "new" at it. Bet your doc did a pelvic, right?  While examining the Inside of your vaginal/uterine area with one hand, gently pressed from the outside at the same time?  From that, he can tell (even before the urine test is back!) if your pregnant or not in many cases...b/c the uterus gets just a bit bigger early on and takes on a more spongy feel than a 'non-pregnant' uterus.  Soooo...your uterus is most like NOT any smaller than the norm...you might not've understood the way he stated it.  Hey! if you're concerned: call 'im back!  That's what you pay the big bucks for!  :-)|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i agree with everyone else, the doctor should have been able to tell you whether or not you were pregnant.
1WBimx1laa	I was pregnant for a month while I was on BC. I didnt know I was pregnant so I didnt keep takin it on purpose but my daughter is fine. They say if you dont do it over a month it really doesnt matter but the sooner you quit taking it the better.|`|VK0L73ziaa	If you get pregnant on BC and you don't know it won't hurt the baby. I don't know where some of the people got there information, but some here are right others are desperately wrong. BC is to prevent pregnancy and it ISN'T 100% at all. I do agree however that if you do end up pregnant and find out do stop taking it.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Birth control has no effect on pregnancy. Your baby will be fine. I was taking birth control 3 months in my pregnancy! (I had no clue I was pregnant). My daughter was fine! Just stop taking it|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Well you want to stop taking it as soon as you find out your pregnant. However some people get pregnant on the pill and dont know it for months and there baby is usually always ok. But once you find out you need to stop taking it immedietly.|`|yrx6GxDcaa	If you find out that you became pregnant while using the pill, it may be helpful to know that there is no conclusive evidence indicating that the pill will harm your baby in any way. Fetuses exposed to the pill during early pregnancy are not at increased risk for developing complications or birth defects. That being said, using the birth control pill while pregnant is not recommended, so if you think you could be pregnant, it may be a wise idea to stop taking the pills and use an alternate form of birth control, like condoms. although most research generally shows that pill use will not harm an existing pregnancy, it is important to point out that there is not a lot of solid research in this area. Researchers rarely study pregnant women due to fear of potentially harming the fetus. While not conclusive, there has been one published study that suggests that taking birth control pills during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital urinary tract abnormalities in the baby.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	It can cause an abortion but also can cause serious birth defects. Its a very common thing because many women don't realize that they are pregnant then continue to take their pills....they probably would abort and not even realize...or else eventually have a baby and see that it has defects.|`|p4R1c6fraa	The pill should be discontinued the moment you find out you're pregnant.I don't think it will kill the baby but it isn't good to take while pregnant.Why would you? If you think you are pregnant and need to know asap then get a  blood test if you haven't had a positive HPT.Good luck.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	It will not harm the baby nor kill it. You need to stop taking it once you find out your pregnant, even if your taking it for any other reason than birth control.
prqrQcd1aa	Because they don't care about the health of their children, as they themselves are probably not very healthy. An occasional trip to burger king or where ever will not make you overweight or obese, but bad eating habits passed down from generation to generation will.<br>  Also there is the problem of people eating for comfort, and the parents not seeing anything wrong with this. If a child is always hungry and you are always feeding them crap, then guess what happens... nothing but weight gain. Sometimes parents need to see the underlying cause of the over eating, and get the child help for it... but then again sometimes the parents themselves need to get help for it too!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	There is no excuse for it.<br>  <br>  Some people want to complain that it costs more...it doesn't.You don't have to buy organic in order to make healthy lifestyle choices.They are just too lazy to actually put forth work when driving to BK is much more easier.<br>  <br>  I was raised on that crap too.I enjoyed it, no doubt! lol but I did have issues growing up because of it.I vowed I would never have my children go through what I went through.<br>  <br>  All the sugar, preservatives, growth hormones, and pesticides are the reason why people have so much health issues and cancer now days.<br>  <br>  <br>  I feed my son mostly organic and if not organic, natural foods.He is a very healthy kid with barely any illnesses (thank goodness)|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Cause they are lazy and healthy food costs a lot more. I 10000% agree with you though and try and be as healthy as possible with mine.  Its pretty sad and disgusting when kids get all obese like that...and have heart attacks at like 10.  They also need more excercise.|`|NBBRWd5Gaa	they were prolly raised eating the same thing so they don't know any better (and too stubborn to change their habits).  oh well, it's too late for them, but at least your children will start eating healthy when you become a father :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I dont think its because they are trying to make her obese its more then likely the way they eat. And thats good that you are making the choice to eat healthy. Dont let anyone get you down about that. I try to feed my son the best that I can we dont eat out all the time but everyonce in a while we do. But my son eats all of his veggies which he loves and is limited on junk food,cookies,donuts and etc. Fast food is fast and you dont have to spend time cooking it, and I think that is the main reason why people eat it all the time. I know when I dont want to cook sometimes its easier to order pizza or grab a burger. And thats fine as long as its not a everyday thing, plus its really expensive. Hope this helps and keep up the good work
AiJeS6I1aa	A good quality book - either one for babies, like a picture book, or one for when they are older.<br>  <br>  I like:<br>  <br>  -Baby! Baby! by Vicky Ceelen  (beautiful picture book for infants with lots of cute pics of babies and animals)<br>  <br>  -Baby Cakes by Karma Wilson<br>  <br>  -The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle<br>  <br>  -Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown<br>  <br>  -Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? by Bill Martin Jr and Eric Carle<br>  <br>  -anything by Dr. Seuss<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, "collections" are very nice.  You can get the complete tales of Beatrix Potter, Winnie the Pooh, Curious George, Dr. Seuss<br>  <br>  So many good choices!  I wouldn't be able to pick just one!<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and make a nice dedication in the front.|`|dHREHByPaa	I would give her something she can use forever. A photo album dedicated to her child would be great. I have 4 kids and always appreciated things like that.|`|roytWpP9aa	a gift card to any specialty Store for babies is a nice, practical girt. clothes are nice too|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would send her a congratulations card with a gift card she can use to pick up things she may not have gotten at her shower....can't hurt...|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Babies first pair of shoes possibly? I know I would never get rid of my daughters fist pair of shoes and my parents still have mine also
vygYFdsSaa	Discharge is absolutely NOT the old eggs dropping out LOL. Of course you could be pregnant, you're having unprotected sex!! Take a test|`|YNH2fmYWaa	why are you thinking your pregnant in the first place?<br>  <br>  if your periods are irregular you would have to track to see when you are ovulating. <br>  <br>  the best thing to do is take a test.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|bo4MguzVaa	what are people telling you?  weird, i dont think your old eggs drop out with your discharge   lol<br>  <br>  your egg that wasn't fertalized breaks down and comes out with your period.  thats what the period does.  when you have a unpredictable period it may be more difficult for you to figure out when exactly you got pregnant or if you are. <br>  <br>  If you are having uprotected sex then it is a matter of time that you get pregnant.  If you aren't married:  use condoms please, STDs suck big time, you dont want any.  You really should be tested if you have had unprotected sex, some stds give you weird symptoms that you may not recognize as an std.  And some don't give you symptoms at all, they just cause major damage internally until you figure out you need to be treated.|`|hhocL3aWaa	About the eggs.  There is no such thing as old or new eggs.  You are born with all the eggs that you will ever have.  And usually only one or two are dropped at once.  The best way to figure out if you are pregnant is to take a test.  Also, you do have more discharge during pregnancy.|`|YbCISxYZaa	i'd go to a ob and take a blood test its the best way to find out if your preg. also you might want to take an ultrasound just to be in case
sMuMfuAgaa	I agree that that is kinda dumb. If you love him, wouldn't you want to try and be friends and not enemies.Most people I know when they have a crush on their enemy they try and break the whole "enemy" bond.Just tell him...if you love him then it shouldn't be hard and I don't understand how you could be enemies but love him.That just makes no sense period.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	tell him about the text and how it was for someone else.<br>  and tell him that you like him. <br>  you need to tell him how you feel or he'll never know...|`|7lTIiL60aa	This just sounds dumb u r enemys but u love him ur enemys byt u txt ??????? Umm get a hobbie|`|YlveXYHUaa	ahhh thats so weird my real name is also emily p...only the p stands for putnam. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh about your question.....<br>  <br>  what??
vejBlTO5aa	No, its totally personal choice. If pads work for you, then why bother with tampons. Besides, they have a risk if left in 2 long (especially the bigger ones).|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You obvioiusly still have your hymen which is why it hurts to wear a condom. Totally fine. I have a lot of friends that only use pads anyway.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I hate using tampons, but if you decide you want to go swimming with your friends, get the smallest tampon that will work for you, relax as best you can, and it shouldn't hurt to put it in. It's not silly or weird to have that problem at all. Some people just aren't comfortable with tampons. The reason it hurt though, was most likely because you weren't relaxed. If you tense up, it's hard to put in a tampon.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I don't think so at all! I've had my period like 7 years and I don't really use tampons. I know how to use them, and I will if I have to (like if I'm babysitting and the kids want to go swimming or something) but I prefer pads. My sister has had her period like 12 years and has not even tried using tampons once...she says she can't stand the idea of it haha. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you haven't really been sucessful at placing a tampon yet....it isn't supposed to hurt. Make sure you are getting it up far enough and at the right angle (the directions included in the box will explain the angle and all that) if you are sure you are inserting them correctly, you might try switching brands. I started out trying tampax pearl tampons and found them so uncomfortable, but I started using playtex and found them so much more comfortable. But my mom is the opposite....she's like how can you even stand those playtex tampons!? It just depends on the person, so it could be helpful to try a couple brands. good luck!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	The first time you tried the tampon it could have been rubbing against your cervix and caused you some pain. Next time you try don't put it straight it but angle it so it doesn't hit your cervix. Practicing putting it in might help to find out what's comfortable for you. If you do not want to use one though that is fine and completely normal, you do what feels right for you.|`|A03NJA26aa	I am 17 and I don't use them. I prefer the pads and I will keep using them. I feel that tampon's are uncomfortable too and I don't swim much anyway so I don't worry about it. Maybe when we are older it won't feel so weird. right now it is your choice, do whats more comfortable for you.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I will be 26 and I do not use tampons. I did try them out when I was in high school but I just could never get the hang of them. Some women/girls  prefer to use just  pads, others prefer just to use tampons while others use both. Really it’s all about what personnel works for you.|`|BvHRriEyaa	Of course it's not weird!!<br>  <br>  I have had periods for coming upto 13 years now and the only time I really use tampons is if i'm gonna have a bath! At the end of the day they are there as a choice, you don't HAVE to use them all the time or even at all if you don't want to.<br>  <br>  The pain could be because you're not inserting it right or because you aren't bleeding enough for the absorbancy you are using, maybe a mixture of both. Also the fact you panic won't help, you have to be relaxed or it won't work no matter what you do.<br>  <br>  If yu still want to try, I recommend you use tampons with a plastic applicator and of course get the lowest absorbancy, use them at a time when you have time to be in the bathroom for a while so you aren't rushing or anything. Familiarise yourself with the instructions beforehand too. <br>  <br>  Remember it can take quite a few tries before getting it right so don't worry, and if you find they aren't for you I promise you it's really not a problem, there are millions of women who prefer not to use them :)|`|1U7yLEf9aa	You aren't doing it right if you think it's too tight. The human vagina is able to stretch to fit a penis and even let out a baby. It's supposed to be the size of a lemon. ?.. Anyways, I know an 11year old girl that uses tampons and it has nothing to do with tightness. You just have to learn to propperly use one. If you don't want to use one of course you don't have to. Just wait till next week to go swimming :).|`|Aj99vuqYaa	I didn't start using them til I was 16. I started when I was 13, almost 14. Just before 8th grade graduation.. sure made for an interesting graduation =P <br>  <br>  But it's not weird at all. I still don't like using them, but will when I want to swim, or if I go to school or something.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	No, its a personal choice. If you don't want to, no one can tell you you have to.<br>  I'm fifteen, and I've had mine for around three years, and I've tried, but they're just not for me. <br>  It may be worth it to try again, you never know, but its entirely up to you.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Kind of. <br>  <br>  I have been using tampons since I was 14. I've had my period since I was 11 and I am 19 now. <br>  <br>  They are the best things under the sun. <br>  I will only wear pads at night. <br>  <br>  I </3 pads. They suck and feel gross.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	I have the same problem, and I'm 18.<br>  This may help... Probably not as good as my parent's explaining it to me, but it's the best I can do.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen</a>|`|y8p5GHaZaa	Im 18 and I don't use tampons.  I can never get them in right.  I mean I think most girls do, but it's not weird not to.|`|jY31JaCeaa	i started wearing tampons at 13/14|`|P0JNLIpRaa	no, it isn't weird at all.<br>  <br>  I'm about the same age, and i just started to use them<br>  <br>  It is your own personal choice what type of feminine hygiene products you use, don't feel pressured to if you are not ready<br>  <br>  but yes, tampons do have their advantages... like swimming.<br>  <br>  It jsut takes a little time to get used to inserting them<br>  <br>  the first few times it may be difficult. This is probbaly because you are scared and panicky (as you mentioned) This makes the vaginal muscles contract. In order for these muscles to become more relaxed, you need to be completely relaxed too<br>  <br>  maybe trying to put one in, in a different position will help you... and tampons that come with applicators are more convenient too<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out<br>  best wishes|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	That's not strange at all. Its your personal preference. Just b/c someone else is doing something doesn't mean you have to follow suit.Alot of times the reason a woman feels pain during tampon insertions is b/c they don't follow the directions in putting one in. Its a good idea to look at the instructions your first time. Also,try Tampax Pearls...in the slimmest one they make due to your hymen being in place.I still wear pads occasionally at 23 almost 24 yrs old...I don't feel silly just more comfortable at times~|`|XCDd3hELaa	no not at all Im 15 and I only used one once for like an hour. I have never tried sex either, it probably hurts because you arnt relaxed enough, and you didnt push the tampon in all the way. lol<br>  its all good though because it's your body, and if you don't like tampons dont use them, i like pads better anyways.|`|WSwkPljYaa	Not at all! <br>  <br>  I got my first period at 12, and used pads for a few years. Then when I was around 14 I noticed most of the girls I knew were using tampons. I felt almost like a baby using pads, so I wanted to try tampons. I bought some and it was extremely painful inserting it, I wasn't doing it right. It took a lot of practice and I still used pads until I was 16. I'm 17 now and I only use tampons when I'm at school (I'm afraid pads will show through my pants!) and when I'm swimming. I still prefer pads because they're just easier, and I just wanted to use tampons to be like everyone else, or so I thought. Now I know a lot of girls that wear pads. It's not a big deal what you use that time of the month<br>  <br>  It takes practice learning how to insert them, so I recommend to keep trying if you really want to use them. I use Tampax Pearl. Use what you want to use. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|oRaYQNXxaa	This isn't weird. Its your own personal choice mainly. But I would talk to my doctor about it though. You shouldn't be feeling pain or discomfort from wearing a tampon. The only reason that I can think of that might be causing you problems is that your using the wrong absorbency or something. Or you didn't put it in far enough. <br>  But if you are doing things correctly and are still experiencing pain and complications you should talk to your doctor and get checked out. There might be something causing you to have these issues. <br>  Best of luck ok :) And honey don't feel awkward about this.|`|zdWDkadraa	Not at all. I'm in my 20's and I just don't like them. I've used them many times in the past, but not at all in the last 5 years. If you don't feel the NEED to use them, stick to pads. If you WANT to try them.. keep trying until they feel normal.|`|XrKviWgSaa	not weird at all, personally i can not stand to use pads at all, i have used tampons since my second period. and i started when i was around 11 and i am now 18.|`|ZMMHNnuUaa	i personly don't think it's wierd.<br>  i am 18 and it might come to your suprise that i have never used a tampon...and don't really plan on it...the idea of them just freaks me out...hope this helped|`|Fc2DkArMaa	Yes, I think they're much easier to put in once you've had sex. Don't worry though, it's only a preference, but tampons do make your life that much easier!|`|OVMb4V7Maa	No, it's not weird. I got my period at 10, almost 11, and didn't start wearing tampons until like 15.|`|AA12383391	it's not weird that you don't use tampons. i dont use them cuz it feels weird to me. hahah|`|AA11079476	its perfectly fine i just started using them and im 20|`|oy6iy4i8aa	no. doesn't matter how old you are u just have a preference.<br>  It doesn't matter!|`|jJZFShbeaa	no. i dont really like them and im 16|`|on5NQxhkaa	It's unusual, but not "weird".<br>  <br>  I would recommend just trying. I hated wearing them at first... but if you learn to put them in correctly they do not hurt or feel uncomfortable. It just takes practice, like riding a bike LOL. Once you get the hang out it you got it.<br>  <br>  I personally love tampons, I do not ever wear pads anymore because it is SO much more convienient, comfortable, and less messy... plus I can swim and play sports with no problem. Also, pads can get kind of smelly if you are not careful... sometimes I smell that odor when people wear them for too long.<br>  <br>  For the sake of keeping life easy, I'd recommend you keep trying tampons. But I'm not saying you are weird, I'm just giving you personal advice from another girls POV.
vygYFdsSaa	Yes, morning sickness is common anytime of the day.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yeah, that's pretty normal. I had nausea that always started after dinner and went until about noon the next day. Why they call it "morning sickness" I'll never know because it can happen at any time of day.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i use to wake up feeling like a million dollars everyday during pregnancy but as the day progressed and i ate i felt crappy and at nite i would feel a bit sick so i enjoyed the mornings more than the night during pregnancy.|`|p4R1c6fraa	"Morning" sickness comes when ever it wants to.I got sick yesterday at 7:30am and then again around 10:00 pm.I seem to get sick if I go to long without food.Example: if I go to bed at 11:00pm and don't get up till 9:00am I can get sick b/c I'm to empty.Certain foods can trigger it too.I've noticed things to acidic cause it for me.Try to stay hydrayed too.Everyone is different.If you are getting so sick everyday that you can't function then talk to your OB/GYN about an anti-nausea medicine.I hope this helps.It's my first baby and I'm 17weeks.|`|peQGGFPYaa	Well i sure hope so because that is me. for the most part i get sick if i wait to long to eat even like 10 minutes after thinking im hungary.
iiUKFLY3aa	I once did the same thing. First the test said negative but then a few hours later it said positive. though I was not pregnant. But it sure tricked me.  There is still a chance for you though. It may have been too early too test or not enough hCG in your urine[the pregnancy hormone it detects]. good luck :)|`|YNH2fmYWaa	you could be pregnant, you just need to make sure that your looking at the test within the time frame it gives you. <br>  <br>  if your "period" was only brown spotting and didnt fill up pads/tampons, that could have been implantation.<br>  <br>  but as we all know this is the waiting game.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|0utvlthbaa	Id say you are pregnant. A positive is a positive no matter how faint the line is. Its rare to get a false positive. The bleeding you did have sounds like implantation bleeding as that is brown in colour and just how you described it. Good luck xx
vygYFdsSaa	I just responded to your last question asking you to describe this ovary "tightness" in a bit more detail?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you are pregnant you should make a doctor's appointment it could be any number of things, ectopic pregnancy, nothing serious, ect.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Are you pregnant? If you are and it is early on what you are most likely feeling is the formation of the corpus luteum, a cyst that forms on your ovary during pregnancy and releases hormones making the pregnancy viable. It's a completely normal thing. I know that I felt an odd sensation early on in pregnancy as well and asked my OB about it and that's what he told me it was. I don't know if I would have described it as a tightening, it was more like the sensation associated with ovulation, sort of a dull pressure or ache.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	I don't think it is your ovary. There is much more in there than you may realize. I don't think your ovary would be tightening and if it did you would not be able to feel it. You should have some blood work done (for everything in that area)|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I honestly wish that I could help you hon but I am afraid all can say is that ireally don't know what it could be. I suggest going to a walk-in clininc tomorrow morning or calling your doctor.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	you mean tight? .. u should google it .. ull get more acurate ansers then here ... and it all depends how far along u are, what u mean by tight, do u feel pressure? any dull pain .. on which side of ur abdomen does it hurt? we cn narrow it down if we know more about how u feel<br>  <br>  welll if ure 5 weeks pregnant i would most definatelly go get an u/s. i dont mean to scare u but there is always a chance for ectopic pregnany, u wouldnt feel much of any pain that early on ...<br>  <br>  ohh check this web out.. just found it .. looks pretty cool, u can point on the woman on the right of the screen where it hurts or ure having discomfort and it tells u what it could be<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/bodymap/465770146" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/bodymap/465...</a>|`|9THRCVtOaa	its a cyst
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Absolutely not, you need to come up for air sometime! I go out leaving the baby with my husband or au pair/room mate and I take my pump with me if I'm out for more than 3 or 4 hours. Like the other Answerer said just wait until they have kids and that will teach them.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Not if it ultimately makes you a better mother, I guess.  I personally have no interest in going out once a week (my youngest is 2 months also), but once a month would be nice. Congratulations, by the way.|`|62b4d7610d61a9537e22693aedeb72b9aa	umm well it kinda is.<br>  i mean maybe once every 2 weeks would be a little better.<br>  but idk its ur choice really. if u feel ur baby is left in good hands while ur out then thats all that matters.<br>  its kinda the same as if u were working a part time job u would be gone everyday. so i mean its ur call hun. but im just saying leisure purposes should be a little less often than if u didnt have a baby.. :D<br>  <br>  but in all honesty its not my business or anyone elses. <br>  <br>  im guessing ur friends were prolly just lookin out for u<br>  dont feel like a bad parent. im sure ur a great mommy. :D|`|YJV2TU6taa	No. Just wait till they have kids, they'll think completely differently.|`|AA12109789	I don't think you are going out too much...I am just jealous of you!<br>  <br>  My son just turned two months and I am breastfeeding as well.  He eats every 2 hours so if I go somewhere, I usually take him with me.  I also have a 16 month old son so usually if we go anywhere it's the three of us and my husband.  I can count on my hand the number of times I've been out without either of the kids since my son was born.<br>  <br>  And going out w/ just my husband?!? Ha! I haven't done that in over a year! <br>  <br>  But as for too often, no...you stay at home with him all day so you deserve a break.  I truly believe that.<br>  <br>  But I do caution to not let it happen too often.  I am actually surprised you got the reaction you did because most people I know think the COMPLETE opposite way.  They work all day with their kids in daycare and then go out all night leaving their kids with a babysitter.<br>  <br>  They would think I'm absolutely crazy!  and would never think you go out too often.<br>  <br>  But I would say that you are already giving so much to your boy by staying at home with him and by breastfeeding - so many mothers don't even give that.  If you are able to have a couple hours a week to yourself - take it!  You are still putting your child first.  That is what matters.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	tell them to mind their bussiness!!!!!! do they know you need a break to keep yourself sain? do not let these people bother you, their opinion doesn't even matter, i really hate when people get in other peoples bussiness like that, if you know ur not a bad mother that's all that matters!!!! ohhhhhhh, u just don't know how mad it makes me! i'm due in 4 days, and i always say how i can't wait to go out, hello..........i've been pregnant for close to a year i deserve some time for me too!!!!!!! I can't wait for someone to say something to me about going out, im gonna tear them a new *** hole!!!!|`|xV3e72e1aa	Well, considering you spend all day every day with him, you probably need a little time away!  A lot of moms work during the day, so going out once a week might be too much for them.  But you get to spend all day with him, so you probably spend more time with your baby than most moms do.  Plus, I'm assuming that you go out at night, and your baby is most likely sleeping then.|`|WZQKevt8aa	Having time to yourself regularly makes you a better mother. You are not leaving him every night to go out. You are with him every day, all day apart from one night for 4 hours! (half that time he is probably sleeping anyway!), you need time to yourself. Just tell them that they have no idea what it's like having kids and they shouldn't judge you or try to give you 'advice' until they have had their own kids!|`|mnvl5GlEaa	being a full time mother is VERY stressful.  you might need this once a week alone.  If you have a trustworthy person to take care of him, while you are out, i wouldn't worry about it.  once they have their children they will think differently- it's not that you don't love them, but sometimes you just need time for yourself.  this will help keep your stress level a little lower.|`|5YVSX6Ggaa	I say good for you! you need time for yourself to regroup. you can't be a good mom if you don't take care of yourself. it's not like you are out every night. I have a six month old and i do not get out hardly ever and i need to. i am envious. Wish i could get a little me time and couple time.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I dont think it is. Gives you some time to be out the house with other adults.  wish I did that. I dont I havent had a break in forever and it's driving me crazy(not literally)! Im with my kids all day every day...cant wait to start nursing school!|`|DHDLVEaCaa	Na You need time out with frineds. You are doing the right thing. Ignore what they are saying.|`|KHcCtJbCaa	Wait til' they have kids, boy will they get a reality check!  With my daughter I never went out, like ever.  At a year old she had only been watched once.  Now my daughter is 23 months old and my son is about two months old.  I just lost one of my really good friends that I lost in touch with after I had my children.  I've realized more than ever that as a parent you can't lose touch with others, friends, family and the human race just because you have children.  You need to be happy, you need to have an "out".  If going out one night a week makes you feel like a person, and makes you happy then it's perfect.  Because as mothers we need time to ourselves, and be able to spend time with others, otherwise we won't be able to do our job as a mother.  Remember if your not happy your child isen't going to be happy.  So you are doing the best thing for you and you child.  Best of luck.

They are defenseless and helpless and depend on YOU...what is wrong with you?<br>  <br>  CONTROL yourself....and grow up  YOU ARE A FATHER...act like one.|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	To stop breastfeeding would be neglecting the babies needs, which are more important than yours.<br>  Play with your own "toy", dude.|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	Your right its selfish if your girlfriend wants to breast feed she should do it not stop cos ur missing out grow up or move out.|`|F32uPjAraa	You selfish pig. Your child will benefit from breast milk. Breast milk is by far better for your child than formula.|`|AA12167030	News flash, ace but your needs (and hers!) are forever second to the needs of the child you two created. Breast feeding is 1000 times better than bottle feeding; it creates a stronger bond between mother and child, the baby gets protection from the mother's immune system longer because he or she is ingesting a product of the mother's body, and the baby is less likely to develop bad teeth because he or she won't be going to sleep with a nasty bottle swishing sugar water all around his or her mouth. You gave up your right to put your own needs first the day you conceived a child, so grow up and act like an adult!|`|aztQDdMXaa	Ha ha ha, you poor thing, I can imagine your a boob kind a person. But just don't tell her this, because if you do, she will go against you and get mad thinking that you don't want the baby. <br>  Tell her you miss her "alone" time with you,but don't get her attention away from the baby. <br>  The baby does need it's mama's milk.<br>  ha ha ha<br>  =>_<=|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Play with yourself, you sound like a giant tit.|`|MeYILJeSaa	So you want her to neglect what's best for your baby when it's going just fine? Wow, way to go Dad!|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	troll.|`|1thElV58aa	Stop being a selfish brat, babies need their mothers natural milk not formula its harder for the baby to digest. a Womens breast is for babies not man play toy. Even if you did tell her its not like she would let you anyways.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Don't put your want and needs ahead of your child, and there should be no reason you cant play with them, she will produce more than enough for both of you.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	Get over it! It's not like she will be breastfeeding forever. Let her breastfeed if she wants and can. There is a big difference between breastmilk and formula. You can still play with them if she will let you. You just might get a little milk on you lol. The health of your baby is more important than you getting to play with them. If you don't feel the same maybe your just not cut out to be a father. There are alot more sacrifices you are going to have to make aside from not getting to play with her breast.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Breastfeeding is the most healthy thing she can do for your child.  Are your toys more important than your child's long term health?<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is the most intimate thing a mother and child do together.  Are you willing to deprive them of their relationship?<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is the best way for a woman to lose weight after pregnancy.  Do you want her to retain all her baby weight?<br>  <br>  You're ridiculous.  It's HER CHEST, not YOUR TOY BOX, and she has the right to breast feed as long as she wants to and as long as she feels is appropriate for her child.  If you can't handle that, I wouldn't blame her for dumping you!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	well, seeing as how breasts are for breastfeeding and not for your sexual pleasure then yes, you are being selfish. I did not breastfeed because I truly could not but it is so much better than formula. I would be pissed if my boyfriend asked me to stop doing something that is truly wonderful for my child. Stop acting like a whiny child, I'm sure it's getting on her nerves. If you want breasts so bad go to a freakin strip club. There aren't any mommies there and I'm sure they'd love to let you play with their boobies.|`|vlvOkbaAaa	It's normal, but she can't breastfeed when the baby's sleep. So that's no big deal.|`|cIn8BkYHaa	It's questions like this that no matter what anybody says everybody is going to have a different opinion on the matter.<br>  <br>  I suggest you let her, it's better to breast feed, you'll get them back eventually, be patient. Think of all the things she had to go through to carry that baby.<br>  <br>  And neglecting your needs? just because she might not let you play with her breasts doesn't mean you have to go without any contact from her. So relax and think about her needs and your child's needs.|`|lxJoXNZwaa	Don't be a baby, she's already got one.  You should be happy that she is nursing!- be a good dad/man - she's doing a great thing for your baby!! - You can still play with "them" during your alone time - you can even enjoy the benefits of breastmilk too - cheers to you!! lol|`|WyvZa1J4aa	you probably cant.|`|AEXJcpmHaa	youre dumb........super dumb.....|`|4WZMto1oaa	Oh my god breast feeding is the best thing for your baby if she dose not want she not going to you just have to live with it maybe you should see a counselor because being jealous of your 2 month old baby is so not normall at all and if you were my boyfriend i would be so MAD at you|`|QE71sNC3aa	Doesn't she have 2 breasts?... I don't see the problem... lol. If you're feeling neglected... get in there!|`|Fa130w6Gaa	Grow up!! Your baby's health is more important than your needs! Formula is not the same as breastmilk. It does supply the nutrients but it doesn't give the baby the antibodies from the mom.|`|u48Wzj3yaa	You need to stop neglecting the baby's needs.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding, if possible, is far better for the baby. And it is her right to do so.|`|EhAiyJmHaa	Your girlfriend is using her breasts for what they were put on her for!  I have been breastfeeding for 12 months and about to quit.   It doesnt sound selfish, it IS selfish.... She should quit when she is ready, dont force her|`|XrKviWgSaa	stop being selfish and realize that breast milk is better for the baby. you can still play with them, she might feel weird with having her boyfriend play with her boobs and then an hour later go and have her child feed|`|4d2B1hRBaa	how about growing up and realizing the beauty in breastfeeding? you said it right on... you are being selfish...AND immature!|`|50fDeNWXaa	If she is able to breastfeed her baby let her. Is having her to your self really more important than your child's health? You need to really consider this if you want to be a good father to your child.|`|AA11738671	Actually, formula is NOT the same thing. In breast milk, the baby gets antibodies from the mother so the baby has a better immune system and it healthier in the long run. You need to be more understanding and supportive--having a baby requires a lot of sacrifice and not touching your girlfriend's boobs is not that big of a deal. It won't last forever--it will be done with soon enough, but first of all it is her choice, and while you are affected by her choice, that baby has to come first because it is helpless without a mother. You're lucky to have a girlfriend who is such a great mother. She is sacrificing her appearance and her body, and all you have to do is go without fondling her chest. Stop complaining, man up, and be a better father.|`|akZrlqOqaa	I think your baby needs milk more than you need to juggle your girls knockers around. <br>  <br>  Wait it out.|`|2QLEwlVKaa	You should get her a pump so she can still give her baby breastmilk without breast feeding.|`|kTchGkdSaa	well firstly, grow up a little and think about the baby. the baby should have natural milk from its mother, not formula out of a company. And secondly, have you thought of talking to your girlfriend about how you feel? try and play with the baby equally, your not two year olds!<br>  <br>  If you talk to your girlfriend she will know how you feel and think and she might want that!|`|VZ90Erh7aa	YOU ARE A ******* ASSHOLE!<br>  try thinking about your child instead of yourself jerk<br>  do you want your child to be healthy? or do you want to have your stupid "toys"?<br>  Get a life jerk off|`|2pNHOCONaa	why did you bother conceiving a child with this girl when you werent even prepared to give her at least the best milk there is for any child?|`|CMRHWmt5aa	What an ***!

fQLeIAh1aa	Perfectly normal. CONGRADULATIONS! Welcome to the 1st trimester lol. Diarrhea, nausea, exhaustion, cramps, mood swings the hole 9! its only going to last a few more months. Then some things will let up and some will be well, more fun..........<br>  <br>  <br>  www.babycenter.com<br>  www.americanbaby.com|`|XEiIYjT7aa	You're perfectly normal! :D I didn't get morning sickness until week 6, but you could be getting it now, it's not that odd! Diarrhea is normal too, in fact I had it in the beginning as well. Just make sure to stay hydrated, and know that mild cramping is completely normal. Your uterus is stretching and your little baby is trying to make a comfortable home. A lot is going on down there, and your body is just tryping to cope.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	Ya, it's ok - but not if you are having it over the next several days.  If it gets bad the you need to get to your doc sooner.|`|vygYFdsSaa	You're fine. Pregnancy makes our bodies do all sorts of crazy things but luckily diarrhea is not a signal that anything is wrong :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I'm sure its ok, as long as you are drinking lots of fluid to replace the fluids you lose you should be ok. All cramping at first is normal and you will get more cramps and pain as time goes on. As long as you arent bleeding there is nothing to worry about. Good luck and congrats on the babe|`|hAuemuWTaa	The diarrhoa is a bug and will go in time but if it get really bad and u lose too much fluid i advice to take urself to the dr or er. In the mean time drink plenty of water and eat dry foods and avoid fatty and oily fooods for now stick to little fruit like watermelon. Ur baby is ok and be fine, the cramping is due to the diarrhoea.
eTPJNcilaa	It sounds to me that she may be hoping for a marriage proposal. She also may have just wanted to see what your reaction would be. Whatever the reason the best thing to do is just talk it over with her. If you already agreed that you would marry her if she was pregnant Im guessing that you really love her. You probably want to work things out with her. Just ask her for her reason of doing this. Has she ever been dishonest to you before? Sometimes people just say stupid things. Just talk to her first before making any decisions.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Seeing this again, and answering again..I'm just gonna copy and paste.<br>  <br>  Okay, there is a few options here. She lied about being pregnant which is totally ****** up and if she did that you should dump her, cause even going to the extent of considering abortion for a "joke" pregnancy does say a lot about her capability of being a parent. she seems very immature.<br>  <br>  Now another possibility is that she was indeed pregnant and went through with the abortion in turn told you she was "just kidding" and that's the reason why there will be no baby in 9 months. Either way she's clearly not the girl you thought she was.<br>  <br>  A woman capable of lying about a pregnancy or even got an abortion doesn't deserve a guy like you. I'd say dump her and focus on school. Then you don't have to worry about this situation again.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I know this will all be hard but, I think the best option for you since there is no baby..is to focus on yourself.|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	It may very well be that she is not coping very well with you being gone.  It is the ultimate most horrible thing a woman could do, lie about being pregnant to the man she supposedly loves with all her heart.  Makes me think she is not happy about something.  I would suggest you take some time to cool off, you have a right to be pissed and angry.  But yelling at her or coming at her in a really negative way will just make things worse.<br>  <br>  Give it a few days, reassess your relationship.  Are you sure you want to marry her?  Have her be the mother of your children?  It's time to ask yourself the tough questions.  If the answer is still yes, then you will need to talk to her about why she did this.  If not, just give her the walking papers and go on with your life.|`|AA11901821	u sound like a serious guy, and really u need to chill. take some time off from the girlfriend because u hate lying. If u dont feel like talking to her, let her know, n then have her respect u by not responding. I mean, u are entitled to be mad n thats ok..<br>  As to why she did this, it would seem that she knows that u are a serious guy and wanted to play a joke, OR, she wanted to see that if she were pregnant, if you would stand up, and be there for her.<br>  Women are strange. I'm a woman, so I should know....lol<br>  Men see things one way - black and white, but we girls see things in all different shades.<br>  Dont worry so much about what she said of what she did. just let her know u were peeved, as u dont think the topic was somthing that she whould have made fun of and then take some time alone to figure this out.<br>  One word of advice. Alsways Use a condom, and finish school, and think about the fact that she *isnt* pregnant,  as a *second chance* for you to do what u have to do for yourself, (finish school) without all the added responsibliites of a child.|`|WxSQA1ZKaa	Maybe try and see things from her point of view, in terms of where she is coming from. She is probably very confused and scared and conflicted right now, and probably having a hard time. I am not taking sides, I just think that often it helps to step into the other person's shoes with these sorts of things, because part of it is probably  you guys miscommunicating. I would give her some space, give yourself some space. Give both of you some time to think and get perspective. Its a really hard situation that you are going through, all you have to know is that you will get through it and be ok.|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	Alright, my advice is to take some time to yourself and figure out what it is exactly that you want out life, and out of this relationship. You two have been together for some time, and have been through some troubling times no doubt. I don't thing she's insane for putting you through this, but I do think that she didn't think it all the way through. It could be that she told you all of this to see what your reaction would be and then just got too tired to finish the conversation like you said. It could also be that she wanted to see if you would leave or stick to what you two have talked about in the past. She could just be freaking out because you are no longer there and she's used to you being by her side day in and day out. She could have been fine with you leaving, but now that you've actually left, it's taking a toll on her and she doesn't know what to do. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hun, the only thing that I can honestly tell you to do, is to sit down, take a deep breathe, and focus on you and what you want to do with your life. I know that it might be hard, but try your best. When you've figured that out, call her back and let her know what you have planned, and don't let up on what you want.|`|43f703a117f1434d70de1356556b8006aa	It sounds to me like she is doing this for attention.  What mature woman lies about being pregnant?  It's a really serious issue to lie or even joke about.<br>  <br>  I think you are justified in dumping her, because personally  I wouldn't trust her after this.  She could start lying about other things.  Trust is very important in long term relationships.<br>  <br>  I hope you make an informed decision.  Think about the future.
2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	first off, no one ever told me i was following the crowd. furthermore, people need to mind their own business. i've only heard of 2 people named aaliyah. one being the singer and the other is my friend's little girl who already had that name when she was adopted from russia. it's a very beautiful name and isn't that common. my kids are victoria and kyle. i chose those names because i just love them. and at the time i didn't know anyone whose kids had those names. but now they seem to be more common that i thought they'd be. :) i also really like the names nicholas, nicole, cameron (boy or girl) and miranda. <br>  <br>  best wishes!|`|Aj99vuqYaa	My friend's name is Paris and in grade school when a police officer came in and was talking he made a joke with the teacher later and was like "who would name their kid paris anyway?" *refering to Paris hilton* and my friend raised her hand and was like "Uh, my dad." he let her kick him for it =P Course she was little and didn't wanna kick him hard lol but still. <br>  <br>  People are just too busy making fun of others lives... as if "celebs" are someone to judge others by. Really, they try to make the NORMAL sized people and sensable people look like they're horrible disgusting freaks. Also, if you have the same name as one, people try to insult you and be like "oh... you named it after... *insert whatever name here*" and you're like "no i liked the name, now get a life"<br>  <br>  Name your child what you want *as long as it's a sensible and decent name (not like Apple or Oak or Tree)* give them something that's unique without going overboard. Your name is completely acceptable.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Because you are only 38w2d it might not be successful. The thing about castor oil is, that it will only work if your baby and your body is ready to go. Being even a little bit dilated doesnt prove the baby is ready to be born unfortunately. <br>  I might give it a couple of more days. My sister tried it when she was pregnant with 2 of her children, it worked like a charm. Within 8 hours of taking the castor oil, both times, she was holding her baby. Good luck and congratulations on your new baby.|`|5f6XnInEaa	What's wrong with actually waiting until you are due?<br>  <br>  Waiting 2 more weeks will not kill you, but castor oil can kill your kid.<br>  <br>  If your own discomfort is coming before your kid's health, I seriously would not have thought about having a kid If I were you.<br>  Selfish woman.|`|AA10916164	Seriously... I'd forget about the castor oil.  Get out and walk around... walking helps or have sex if you can. The semen helps your cervix.  Baby is ready when they decide.  Not much you can do.  I am 34 weeks and will be starting Red Raspberry Leaf tea to help my cervix, I've heard it helps.. but my doctor isnt so sure it helps that much.  <br>  <br>  Does your doctor know you are trying the castor oil ?|`|70dzGtQIaa	I tried this at 41 weeks pregnant and it did nothing for me. I was also 2 cm and 80% effaced before I took it. It still did nothing. I guess it just depends on what you want to do, but do keep in mind it can cause meconium. I'm not trying to hate; just keep you informed. Good luck!|`|M6AySVxOaa	I don't know if your doctor prescribe castor oil or not but it should be pointed out that castor oil is a toxic substance. You should ask your doctor.

2HETgiwgaa	Sorry, I can't answer about the timeframe - I'd suggest contacting the clinics or Fertility New Zealand.  But, I do know it is faster if you find your own donor (friend or relative).  The fertility clinics in New Zealand advertise for egg donors, and I've also seen private advertisements in magazines like Treasures.  <br>  <br>  If you can find a private donor, the restrictions are more relaxed. For example normally egg donors have to be aged between 21 and 35 but if you have your own donor and understand the issues of using eggs from an older woman, they may be willing to use eggs from a woman who's a little older than 35.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust :)

kaqPSgTVaa	There is no form of birth control that works 100%. I don't believe there is a certain age you have to be, consent laws probably vary from state to state. You can try Planned Parenthood. They'll be able to help you out there.|`|YNH2fmYWaa	birth control is not 100% effective.<br>  <br>  if you or whoever plans on going to a regular doctor and are under the age of 18 you will have to have a parent or guardian go with you.<br>  <br>  but i believe you can get birthcontrol at any planned parenthood.|`|O2oG7kiEaa	abstinence is the only 100% guarantee. but since you don't really seem to be looking at that route, you should get some form of birth control and have the guy use a condom too, just to make sure you are doing all you can.  how old are you? your age kinda decides if you can get birth control without parents permission, it also depends on the place.|`|yf4o7aNwaa	abstinence. if you're not ready to maturely talk about it with your parents then i don't think you should be having sex.
ZIq2IzOmaa	Plan B is not something you should take lightly. It is a SERIOUS dose of hormones and it can disrupt her cycle. She should have read the directions that came with her medication completely so she would know what to expect. <br>  <br>  Have her call her doctor and check in with them about what's happening and when she should expect her next period. Most likely what she experienced was some breakthrough bleeding. Her uterus has been disrupted by the Plan B and the exertion of sex caused a little bleeding. <br>  <br>  If the two of you are having sex, you need to get her on a regular form of birth control immediately. She CANNOT take Plan B often, it will make her sick. At the very least the two of you need to learn to use condoms correctly and use them every time you have sex. <br>  <br>  Plan B is not an acceptable regular birth control. It is for emergencies only.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Could be her period.Could not.Nobody here can diagnose her online!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  FYI, Plan B could affect her cycle this month and potentially future months.|`|29zyJ95Eaa	It could be her period..

My periods come on irregularly.<br>  But then again I am in my teens, haha.<br>  I don't know what happened but she's not pregnant and it's probably her period. Tell her to wear some pads or tampons, whichever she uses and then a few hours later see if there is still blood.<br>  Then it's probably her period...|`|dRjB0isAaa	I don't remember how Plan B exactly works, but I have heard that it can mess up a woman's period, which of course would happen if the Plan B pill contains any artificial hormones to prevent the pregnancy (like the Pill).

xUNowEfQaa	keep putting baby on you; he'll help increase your supply more than the pump.  But, the pump is better than nothing. <br>  <br>  Increased supply comes from increased demand.  Feed or pump OFTEN to increase supply.  You should be pumping out at LEAST what he's taking in.  If he eats 30 ounces in a day, you should be pumping at least 30 ounces in a day.  Try to get more out than he takes in if you can.  That means pumping at least as many times as he eats (10 or more times per day) or more often if you can't get very much.<br>  <br>  If your body doesn't put out as much milk as he eats (like if you supplement with formula for instance) it will DECREASE your supply over time, rather than increase it, and you may have to stop before you're ready.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/relactation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/relact...</a><br>  Relactation or induced lactation (for those who did not give birth to their baby) is essentially a two-fold process:<br>  <br>     1. You will be teaching (or re-teaching) baby to nurse at the breast, and to equate nursing with comfort. If you're having problems getting baby to nurse, see Help -- My Baby Won't Nurse!<br>     2. At the same time you will be developing (or re-developing) a milk supply. Developing a milk supply requires nipple stimulation (via baby nursing, hand expression, pumping or a combination) and milk removal (once there is milk to remove). If your baby will nurse, regular and frequent nursing sessions (even if baby is just learning in the beginning) will be very helpful.<br>  <br>  If your baby is 4 months old or younger it will generally be easier to relactate. It will also be easier if your milk supply was well established (frequent and effective nursing and/or pumping) during the first 4-6 weeks postpartum. However, moms with older babies, moms who did not establish a good milk supply in the beginning, and adoptive moms who have never breastfed can also get good results. Keep in mind that breastfeeding is not just about the milk. Your child will get numerous benefits from breastfeeding even if you do not have a full milk supply.<br>  <br>  If baby is willing to latch on, then nurse often (at least every 2-3 hours). Also, offer baby the breast for comfort any time you see a chance- at the end of a feeding when he is not hungry, when he is going to sleep and just waking up, and whenever he needs to comfort suck. Even if baby is not getting any milk at first, the nursing will be signaling your breasts to make milk.<br>  <br>  What if baby will not latch? Keep working at it - some babies have gone back to the breast after many months of bottle feeding. Even if you are not able to persuade baby to latch, you have the option of re-establishing your milk supply via pumping and giving baby your milk via bottle or cup (this is called exclusive pumping). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby/back-to-breast.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...</a><br>  Introduction<br>  <br>  The following techniques have proven helpful for a wide range of problems with baby refusing the breast. Some of the babies who might benefit include:<br>  <br>      * a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeed<br>      * a previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed again<br>      * a baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)<br>      * a baby with nipple confusion<br>      * a baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)<br>      * a baby on a nursing strike<br>  <br>  Even if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect "two steps forward and one step backward."<br>  <br>  If you're getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesn't Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.normalfed.com/Help/babyget.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.normalfed.com/Help/babyget.ht...</a><br>  "My Baby Just Doesn't Get It"<br>  <br>  There are lots of reasons why a baby can't seem to get the hang of latching on and nursing well at first. While your baby learns how, you need to: 1) keep him fed, 2) keep your milk supply going, 3) keep in touch with breastfeeding specialists... and 4) keep the faith! Your baby will learn how. These babies did.<br>  <br>       Emily just didn't get it.  She would root, but she didn't seem to understand latching on.  Like almost all non-nursing babies, she could suck just fine on a finger. Her mother worked on positioning, and began using a rental pump to make sure her milk supply would build whether or not Emily began nursing soon.  She bottle-fed Emily, using formula to supplement her still-low supply.  Over the next few weeks, she tried different positions, a nipple shield, a feeding tube, and finally just stopped trying for a week. "Look, Emily," father said to daughter, "The whole world sucks.  There's no reason you can't."  A little more time with the nipple shield, and Emily started nursing.  It took her a bit longer to become fully competent, so her mother continued to pump and offer an evening bottle.  By 6 weeks, the formula and the breast pump were gone.<br>  <br>       Daniel just didn't get it.  He would try and try to latch on, then give up in frustration. After just one visit from a lactation consultant, Daniel and his mom "got it together".  It was a simple matter of positioning.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	Yes, be sure to drink lots and lots of water and other fluids this will help keep the supply up. Keep trying to work with him. Sometimes your nipple is a little too big for their little mouth. I had this problem the first week or two. Also, try to relax concentrate on feeding your baby while your pumping. That may help your milk to come down.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	Yes..just keep pumping every hour until all of a sudden you have about 7 ounces. You'll be amazed.<br>  And if for some reason that doesn't happen...then be happy that formula is around to nourish your amazing 8 day old.<br>  Congratulations.

There is the exception of lower back aches and tender breasts because those usually come along with periods as well and even if you weren't to get your period a lot times you will get period symptoms (weird).  Anyways around 6 weeks I started getting really nauseous, I also got the back aches and tender/veiny/swollen breasts.  I had severe headaches and I peed almost every 5 minutes lol.  The one thing I didn't really get yet is constipation.  The nausea is so bad though that some days it is impossible to move, and i'm 24 weeks and still have it.  I think you could definitely still be pregnant, don't think you aren't just because you have no symptoms, they will come in time.|`|AEXJcpmHaa	I found out i was preg and 4.5 weeks....only symptoms i had was bigger boobs a little and some light crampiness....like i was going to start my period....nothing really noticable at all|`|EmhBDHMtaa	you don't really start having symptoms until about 6 or 8 weeks....but test in the morning if neg retest next week this time if you haven't gotten your period by then.

55b8fb502d696b2763b1fa2013c036b6aa	Very much so. Being overweight usually causes you to have abnormal periods, which makes it very hard to conceive. Its also unhealthy to be overweight already, before you are pregnant. Its better to be in good shape.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	Yes, it can contribute to hormonal imbalances which screw with your ovulation.  I was overweight when trying to conceive and my periods weren't even coming on their own.  I had to take Clomid.  However, the doctors thought I might have PCOS, so in my case, it was probably not JUST a weight issue.|`|2Dy6jZBtaa	actually a lot of doctors believe so because there is a good amount of evidence that weight is a factor in being able to conceive. one being overweight can effect ovulation. its because women who are overweight produce more estrogen because there is more fatty tissue. also, there may be a problem on the fact that women who are overweight tend to have a harder time because the sperm cant make it to the cervical mucus for some number of reasons...also if the male is overweight, overweight men tend to have a lower sperm count or low sperm viability...overweight women also can have health problems that can effect becoming pregnant such as a thyroid disorder or PCOS. if you are overweight, you should consult with ur doctors on how to loose weight safely while u are trying to get pregnant, if being overweight is in fact hindering ur ability. againt it cant hinder ur ability, but it may not, its always best to talk it over with ur doctor and do a number or tests to figure out if it possibly might be contributing.|`|2HETgiwgaa	It can - I am heavier than when I got pregnant with my son, and have not been able to get pregnant this time TTC #2 for more than 2 years.  I'm older, too, obviously - but I'm working on losing weight because I know that it can make a difference.  I read a study that showed, even if you aren't so overweight that it interferes with your period, a higher BMI is linked with what they call "subfertility".|`|4Uuehq2Faa	Im overweight and 12weeks pregnant, it took 4 months with my boyfriend to get pregnant, it depends on other factors too, not just weight, i have PCOS and overweight, if i can get pregnant you can somehow too :) keep being positive|`|YNH2fmYWaa	it can, not always but it depends on the person.<br>  <br>  some studies show that it does|`|qzY6TuQmaa	nope big girl here and i get pregnant real easy and so does my husbands aunt shes bigger then me and she has 6|`|zHRTD7mnaa	No obesity has to do with your overall body mass.Being able to conceive is based on four things.If the woman's female reproductive organs (Cervix.uterus,Fallopian tubs)work properly .If she is fertile.Last but not least if the male sperm is fertile enough to fertilize her eggs,or if her body takes to artificial insemination.That's when the eggs are placed into her body by a doctor to be fertilized either by the man through intercourse or sperm that has ben donated.Being fat doesn't stop you from getting pregnant.|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	No, with an occasional yes.  Just like being too skinny keeps you from getting pregnant.  Look at Nicole Richie.  The baby needs some "fat" to survive in the womb.  A lot of people have written about this online on different sites, and I feel that stress & health problems is a major contributor for not being able to conceive.  Also, sometimes the men is the reason why it's not happening.  If you're too overweight or too skinny, you'll have irregular periods & won't ovulate.  And just because you have a period, it doesn't mean you ovulate either.  Some dr's told me that if I get my period, I'm ovulating.  For 6 months I used ovulation kits, and 2 months I didn't ovulate, but had my period still.  I don't think any "professional" really knows what's going on.  They change their mind often.  Try not to worry about it & do what you need to do to have your precious bundle of joy!|`|hIoxij6eaa	I have heard that if you are overweight then lose even just a small amount then your chances of falling pregnant go up.|`|0utvlthbaa	Nope i am over weight and i get pregnant real fast, i just have problems keeping them inside xx good luck xx|`|EmhBDHMtaa	um i've heard it reduces your chances...it's best for a doctor to make that conclusion.|`|510MC9SVaa	yes, being overweight can cause problems with getting pregnant.|`|olopisx7aa	No. Overweight ppl get pregnant all the time.|`|H3BnjA92aa	Yes, that is true. My gyno. spoke to me about it. It is especially difficult if you don't have regular periods. Try a fertility monitor.
kaqPSgTVaa	Well since you have those symptoms before your period it's really really hard to say. It's best to wait for Sunday to test to be sure. You may still get your period.

Bm5TLWgdaa	DO IT! youll be fine. if he says no then you know he wont want to.<br>  and it wont hurt if you do. all you can do is ask. the worst is say no. then that means look for others. plenty of others wont be as lucky as him to be asked by you.|`|CTO5w03jaa	If he is really your friend first before anything i think that it would be cool and he is older so all the girls will really think you are cool to have older friend. he probably say yes after all its for u....smile|`|QjRXjiF2aa	If you have been friends for that long, I say why not. I now alot of seniors who were dating freshmen, and they came back to go to their prom.  I think its really cute.  Even though you aren't "dating" I'm sure he'd love to come party with you on prom night =D|`|D83u6VvTaa	No. It wouldn't be lame at all. A lot of people take friends to prom because they have a better time than taking someone that they are dating. If you're really that close it shouldn't be a big deal for him at all. <br>  <br>  Go for it!|`|yIRcd5X8aa	It does not hurt to ask =D<br>  When i was 17 i went to prom with a 20 year old.

Go for it girl!!|`|pZGVI9dPaa	All he can say is no and I'm pretty sure you can handle that seeing that you two are friends. I would ask him. It's worth the try.|`|ja7kdPIGaa	He'll probably say yes, but might think it's weird since you've known each other for ever and cause of the age diff. <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|896be109453cf76b326ad27023084d3caa	Ask him , life is short ... accept whatever answer he gives you and don't tempt himinto sex of any kind because you might get him in trouble ... short and sweet!|`|SqxuwtCsaa	Sure, go ask him maybe he wants to go, and he dont tell you nothing..Good luck|`|0nLdieBLaa	go for it! of corse he'll say yes.|`|rkkHQwkKaa	no|`|5tqh0akYaa	I think its okay, since you have known him for awhile. best of luck :]|`|kRaVa0Wraa	i'm guessing he would hate it....once you get out of high school, you generally DONT want to go back. also, your school probably has a rule saying that students that aren't in highschool can't go to prom. my school does.|`|2aJ7gHQgaa	I think you might have more fun if you went to prom with someone from your school.  If your date doesn't know anyone, it might be awkward for you to talk to other people or hang out with your friends.  But...if you really like him and you think the two of you would have fun, it's worth asking.|`|ugCp0krVaa	I did the same thing.  I asked a college friend to take me to my prom and he did. I was 16 and he was 19.  We had a good time as friends only. <br>  <br>  Just let him know how much it would mean to you, if he went with you.<br>  I think he will be okay with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SEKseW8Caa	he'll go if he likes you...<br>  but maybe a little too old... ?|`|AA10248312	Considering how long you've known him, it probably wouldn't hurt to ask him.  I'm not sure how much fun a 20 year old would have at a prom... might depend if he went to the same school, and how involved he was with things at school.  If you go with him, you'd probably have to stick with him most of the night, you don't necessarily want to leave him by himself when he might not know anyone.<br>  <br>  Is there no one in your school right now that  you'd want to ask instead? Give it some thought .. well, you probably already have.  How about guys you know that are your age and go to other schools?  Is it possible to ask one of them?<br>  <br>  Another question would be,  "is going to the prom that important to you?"  <br>  <br>  If a guy is one year out of high school, then going to a prom with a girlfriend who's a year younger isn't a huge deal... but being two or three years out of high school is another story, especially if you're not really boyfriend and girlfriend. <br>  <br>  It might impress your friends if you go with an "older" guy, but is it something that HE would want to do?  Going to a prom is not cheap these days (it never was, actually)... so is it something he'd want to spend his money on?  You'd be in a better position to answer that than I would.  If he's taking a semester off from college, is it because of money problems?<br>  <br>  I would probably advise you to go ahead and ask him if you think that doing so wouldn't affect your friendship if he says no.  If you value the friendship (you obviously do) and you think that asking him might adversely affect it, then you probably shouldn't ask him.<br>  <br>  If simply being at the prom is your main objective, perhaps you could ask him only if you can't get a guy your own age to go, either from your school or from another school.  Again, imo, I don't think that a 20 year old would enjoy going to a high school prom with someone who's "just a friend".  <br>  <br>  But, on the other hand, going as "friends" can be the BEST way to go to a prom.  No pressure to do stuff you shouldn't be doing.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Go ahead and ask him... worst that could happen is he says "no".  He's not going to stop liking you just because you asked him to a prom.  He'd probably be somewhat flattered.|`|J1rrfQk0aa	If you guys are good friends, I'm sure he would go to the prom with you. There is nothing wrong with taking a friend to the prom, many people do it. It's not always possible to time being in a relationship with a social function - its better to go with a great friend and have a blast than to go with someone you hardly no, go alone, or not go at all.|`|tSwCd5kvaa	Our opinions don't matter. It's how you feel and how you think you should approach. If I told you to don't go, and you really wanted, then my opinion is wrong in your views. Just remember and think about this, don't do anything that you would regret.|`|3xz9lgB4aa	I dont think anybody can answer that question.<br>  but you wanna go with him so ask him.<br>  dont be afraid of rejection, its not like he'll stop talking to you if he doesn't wanna go.<br>  Also, wondering if he wanted to go will annoy the hell out of you ><|`|rslrxUoWaa	It would be really cool to ask him to prom and although I don't know either of you, if theres no reason for him to say no why would he?|`|8XqzxKz9aa	I would say no. That is lame for a college student to go to prom no matter the relationship. Plus he had his time in high school, why go back?|`|pNlsQAlNaa	i think you should go for it. if hes a good guy and a good friend, which he should be after 10 years, he'll say yes.|`|0DtWgXxUaa	If you're friends, he wont reject you. Just ask him to go with you, 'as friends'. :)|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	The worst he can say is no right?<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask him of you want to. <br>  Don't let anyone else make your decisions for you.
Bjad8v8Maa	It sounds like she has a very broad diet already.  You could try some things like grilled cheese, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, mac and cheese, avocado, kiwi fruit, pancake, french toast, scrambled eggs.  Toddlers can be very picky and may need to have the food offered to them many times before they will accept it.  We all have different pallets and if she doesn't like her food mixed up, that is OK too.  It sounds like she really likes things that are fresh.  You may also try to add something for her to "dip" her food into like applesauce or catsup.  My 12 month old LOVES to dip!  Keep offering different foods and don't get too frustrated with her.  Good luck!|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	Sounds like you first need to get her completely off formula. Pediatricians recommend that children be put on whole or 1% cow's milk at the age of 1.She should also be introduced to juices.There is no reason why she shouldn't be off baby food and eating table food some now.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I'm confused, perhaps you should try sentences.<br>  <br>  If your baby will eat bananas, yogurt, peaches, pears, sweet potatoes, potatoes, peas, corm on the cob, chicken strips and toast why do you want her to eat junk like take out, packet food, baby food, or "chicken" nuggets -do you have any idea what "mechanically separated chicken" is?!|`|AA12181093	At 13 months old, she shouldn't be on formula at all.  Wean her off it now & get her on whole cow's milk only.  She needs the fat in the milk for brain development.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep letting her feed herself.  That's a part of her learning & growing process.  Yes it's messy. Put her highchair over an old sheet or 2 old towels.  She can have a bath after eating.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Offer her the Gerber Graduates line of food for toddlers.  There's sooo much available to choose from too.
qHwI9ev8aa	The tests are very accurate, it looks like you're pregnant. Very few things can give you a false positive. Make a doctor's appointment and in the meantime gets lots of fluid and eat healthy food.Don't restrict yourself, eat when you're hungry. Your iron levels might be low (can make you dizzy) so eat some red meat and dark green veggies. Also remember to take a prenatal vitamin and folic acid.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Being hungry all the time is normal in pregnancy. You are probably feeling dizzy and getting weak because you need to eat more and that is your body's way of telling you.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Well, since it was positive, I am guessing you are pregnant.If you are unsure, go get another test or go to the doctors.Nobody can diagnose you online.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	yes i had that i had to eat alot with my 2nd just when u do feel dizzy eat something small|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Well, if it was positive...then you are pregnant....the other symptoms sound like a flu....|`|rslrxUoWaa	Go see a doctor ASAP|`|AA12383391	uh...the test says it all doesn't it?? 2 lines makes a positive! instead of going on here to ask a questions because you're concern, i would of spend the time calling a doctor and scheduling a check-up...<br>  <br>  congrats on the baby!|`|H9OFtkeoaa	Stop fooling around.  If you even think are pregnant go to a doctor or free clinic now!  You are not dizzy and weak at times, at every 30 minutes you are dizzy and weak all the time.|`|51cd856f9c2a18d1e26ffbefc3cea6d8aa	go to the doctor|`|vpekuSQnaa	uhm, the p - test said yes, so i'm guessing yer prego.

It sounds strong and handsome. It's a great name :)<br>  Scottie sounds like a cute name for a puppy or a nickname for a boy.<br>  Caden sounds ok, but not as good as Dylan.<br>  Joel is a good name, but it's just too plain, in my opinion.|`|v9bTfQGMaa	Dylan|`|6yD5k9Azaa	Kaden <br>  Dillion|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Caden is really cute. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|mgCvQx9jaa	I love Joel, and Dylan is nice although I prefer Declan.<br>  <br>  Dylan Joel is a really cute name though, and the nickname could be DJ.|`|U2w775zZaa	I love Joel and Scottie absolutely gorgeous.

IYULF7NDaa	highly unlikely....but test In a couple weeks to be sure.|`|256cVXsmaa	Some of those aren't pregnancy symptoms that you mentioned.  Also you don't even get symptoms that early.  It takes about 6 weeks to feel pregnancy symptoms and even then it is rare.  You are freaking yourself out and making yourself paranoid which is making you feel symptoms that aren't really anything to worry about.  I used to do this all the time before I got pregnant.  Stop stressing out or you won't get your period. If you missed your period than you can take a test.  I would wait 3 days after you miss your period for accuracy.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test in a few more days. 14 days after sex is usually the "magic day" when most women are able to get positives if they are pregnant.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Tooth sensitivity and headache are not pregnancy symptoms. Frequent urination is but it can also be attributed to many other things. Its too soon to take a test, wait until you miss a period. It is unlikely that you'd get pregnant by having sex the last day of your period tho|`|DTVJtHYLaa	i'm kinda goin throu the same thing right now..I would hold off on a test for a couple more weeks it's possible you are but at the same time it's not it all depends on when you ovulate!|`|zRQmWC5saa	I dont think so, maybe its all in ur head|`|k2jnCIYeaa	no your not those aren't even symptoms of being pregnant. plus if you are its way to early to tell. cept for having to pee alot but like i said its way to early for you to tell if you are or not. <br>  <br>  just wait 19 days after you had intercourse and take a test|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	wait to see if you get your period if you are the hcg levels are not high enough to test correctly|`|axaD1D0Caa	Im not totally sure but I think you should reax and wait to see if you miss your period...
Cx5Zo7IIaa	What I did was fed my baby every three hours, keep them awake for 30 - 90 min (max) afterwards then lay her down for a nap. Repeat. I found this schedule worked for me because I can always count on when she was going to nap so I could use that 90 min nap time to clean the kitchen, do laundry or take a nap myself. At first she would only stay awake for 15 min and now she's 12 wks old and stays awake for the 90 min. she knows when it's nap time because I still bundle her and in less she's gassy fussy she's out in a few minutes. It's a very simple uncomplicated schedule that got my baby sleeping through the night at 6 weeks. Baby's stay asleep longer if they are bundled tightly because their own jerkly limbs will wake them up. Don't start the bad habit of rocking her to sleep because you'll be stuck doing it still in 6 months. Sometimes they only need to cry for a couple of minutes before they will put themselves to sleep. If you have to rick her make sure she is bundled first so she doesn't miss the being held feeling when you put her down.  Good luck|`|n6XYYyoLaa	your baby makes her own schedule for quite a while, you just adjust around her unfortunately...she's only been in the outside world four weeks so she feels safe in mom's arms and insecure laid down alone... a 'swaddle me' by kiddopotamus, ten bucks, should help...we had two, used them from the beginning, and my dd has always slept through the night....but at any rate, it should help keep her asleep when you lay her down....and don't lay her down on a cold sheet; if it is really cold in your house, lay  a heating pad there for a few mins, and then  move it when you are ready to put baby down....good luck, but you have to accept that for quite some time your schedule will be the same as her schedule...hth|`|T1q4GWLkaa	I'm not sure you really can.  You can establish a routine, but she might not pick up on it and start sleeping when you want for months.  My daughter, thankfully, has slept through on her own and even though she wakes up when I put her in her crib, she plays and goes back to sleep on her own.  I think if you continue to be responsive to her (no it is not spoiling), she will eventually trust her needs will be met and will feel comfortable falling asleep on her own.  That doesn't mean come running at the tiniest whimper, but I wouldn't leave her bawling in her crib either.  I still rock my daughter to sleep most nights at five months, but she always wakes up.  I do it more to get her in a sleepy mood...otherwise she will play in her crib in the dark four an hour or more before sleeping.  LOL.  Once your daughter doesn't need to wake to eat and feels secure that you will come for her if she needs you, she will establish her own schedule.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Good luck at that age you really dont have a schedule. Until the baby is sleeping through the night you are at their beck and call. As far as rocking I dont know, my son is 2 yr olds and sometimes I still will rock him to sleep he likes it and I dont mind. They say to put them down when they are almost asleep. Good luck|`|9q2RmVHRaa	You can't.  Baby will eventually fall into a pattern of sleep through the night and staying more awake during the day.  During the night when she wakes, don't play with her.  Just feed her, burp her, and change her then put her back to her own crib.  Babies will learn that night is for sleeping and the day is for playing, but currently your baby is so young they do need to eat more often than an older infant.<br>  <br>  It is a mistake to have your baby fall asleep in your arms every time.  When your baby is tired, lay her in her crib.  She will soon learn to fall asleep on her own.  You are not a bad mother because she cries.  As long as she is safe, dry, warm and fed you are doing everything correctly.|`|TlFnIei0aa	It's possible!!! My daughter is 5 weeks and has been sleeping well at night for a week now. It took us a week to get her in the schedual though. She sleeps for 5-7 hours when we first put her down, and another 3-5 (depending on how ong she slpet when shefirst went down) hours after feeding in th middle of the night.<br>  <br>  In th morning keep her awake for at least an hour.<br>  Only let her sleep for 2-3 hours in one block during theday, and keep her awake for a bit between sleeps. And only let her sleep for a total of 7 hours during the day.<br>  <br>  Feed her well before bed, if she falls asleep while feeding wake her up to keep feeding. You want this to be her huge feed for the day.<br>  <br>  It will be hard at first, it will seem impossible to wake her up.<br>  Also if she wakes up when you put her down it's OK, I know it seems mean to let the cry, but they actually don't for very long, they soon fall asleep. If she cries for 15 mins however, pick her up and comfrot her before you put her to sleep again.<br>  <br>  Oh and play soft music when its bed time, let her learn a certain song means go to sleep, I don't actually do this myself but I've hard it works wonders. Also burning lavender oil in an electric burner is meant to be relaxing for babies.<br>  <br>  I have a very happy and content little baby so doing this isn't cruel.|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	Some helpful tips might be to make sure she is around as much daylight as possible during the daytime hours and keep it nice and dark during bedtime. This helped alot in my household...they tend to learn day from night that way. Try giving her a bath right before bedtime and rubbing her down in lotion...it helps calm a fussy baby quickly. Make sure she gets full when she does feed...if she is hungry you will be up a whole lot. Sometimes a pacifier helps to soothe a baby and let them know they are safe by swaddling them during bedtime. I know each of my sons slept through the night at 3 months old with these tips and tricks. You can expect to be getting up to still feed and change her at least several times a night but if a nightly routine is established you will grab a few extra zzzz's here and there. Good luck~
49UDvibqaa	Sylamina, is a navajo name
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, I think that is a very personal decision that you need to decide for yourself. I don't think random people on the internet can tell you what you should do with your life. If you feel like you cannot be with her after that then I think it is pretty obvious that you should end the relationship. Basically, only YOU know the answer to this question, so listen to what your heart is telling you.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	well a baby shared is way more of a commitment than a marriage so y not get married? i mean baby is FOOORRREVEERRR....!!! if you want the baby step up and take claims...maybe she would change her mind|`|vygYFdsSaa	It really depends how you feel about the girl. Ultimately its the woman's choice, she doesn't really *need* your approval. That being said I think its messed up if a girl has an abortion without discussing it with the father/considering his opinion. You'll have to decide if your girlfriend killing your child together is something you can get past.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	I completely agree with Jess.<br>  <br>  If you didn't want kids. Don't have sex. That's the only REAL way of preventing children. Pills and condoms don't always work--- i know someone who had BOTH those fail for her, TWICE.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Well it is her body, I believe that you do have some say but when it comes down to it, her body. I dont think its worth breaking up with her about but unless there is other things involved. Good luck|`|eKOgRHa6aa	How about being supportive?? You can impregnate her another time when SHE's ready not just when you are.|`|iLlEoIiiaa	I think abortions are so wrong. I understand if you two are not ready for this child and there is nothing wrong with that but abortion is not a birth control. You also do not have to get married just because you are having a baby being married does not make you great parents! Maybe you guys could talk about adoption if you guys dont want to keep the baby. There are plenty of women and couples out there who can not have babies who would love to take care of yours. I think you guys should sit down and talk about all the options there are and decide on the one that is best for the both of you.|`|AA12383391	do you really love your girlfriend? im sure she is upset about the abortion also, because its her baby too. for you to break up with her because she doesn't want to keep the baby seems a little cold blood to me.if you both are not even ready to get married, how can you be ready to take on the role of being a father? it's not just buying a doll from Toy's R Us and play parents with, then return it or put it away after you got a feel of how it is. i think you should be supportive her decision and man up.  of how old are you? maybe next time use protection...|`|3ixmHSwmaa	It's already too late for you bucko. You will either have to bear the burdon of killing a future human being or raising one.<br>  <br>  Next time keep the stupid thing in your pants or learn about protection!<br>  <br>  *Sing As If No One Is Listening*: Luv your screen name! I think your "friend" is playing you like a fine fiddle. Try doing a little probabilities analysis on her situation and decide for yourself.|`|98bxBr20aa	dunno<br>  my answer is use protection.
00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Depending on how long this girl has been with your family she may later not become as clinging. Your sister is probably just so happy to a home and a mom and sister now. We often take many things for grantee such as having a family and home. Also depending on this girls history whether she was in a group home or orphanage  and for how long. Could also explain her great joy and wanting to spend as much time with her new family as possible.  In her mind she might be thinking this is a temporary situation or that you might send her back. Even if your mom has told her she is for keeps she may still have these feelings.  Once she realize she anit going anywhere again her clinginess may not be as much and she is likely to also want some time to herself as well. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you can set aside some time each day to have sister time.<br>  <br>  Its understand you are adjusting too after being any only child for 16 years.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	It really sounds like she is starting to feel comfortable and loved in your home. She will start to want to do things by herself after awhile. I'm sure it's emotional for her right now. She does need to be with someone she trusts, and that person just happens to be you. Make sure she feels acceptance from you and your family because that's what she needs to gain confidence. If she knows you will be there for her later, she will feel more comfortable leaving you alone for awhile. She's just a bit unstable right now and needs to know someone loves her and cares about her. She needs to know someone wants her around. She will gradually start to want to be by herself, but right now it may be hard for her to even think about being by herself. Think about it, you were an only child for 16 years and now your life is changing. She didn't have parents or a family to love her and care for her for 14 years and now she does. It's going to be much different for both of you from now on.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It might be scary for her to be in a group of people all at once, but if you have a friend over then she might get comfortable with them as well and spend time there, so that you could have time alone. Maybe there is a group you can join while she is having mother/daughter time with your mom and she could do the same for you to spend time alone with your mom.|`|AA10529334	Aww poor Natalie had it good didnt she - didnt have to share anything at all now darn, along comes another kid.

Children from Eastern Europe suffered so much.  Try to get an interesting book or magazine that she could enjoy without you.  Also, does she know how to work the computer?  Find a hobby for her that you can do with her sometimes.  <br>  <br>  It's not cool to get a sister at 16, but let this be the reason why you get wings or a shiny halo.  She needs love and a friend/sister.  There must be a good reason why God has made her your sister.  <br>  <br>  Be an angel to her and for her.  You can do it!
T1R6UZDOaa	I love the name Camden.  I would definetly put it on my baby name list.|`|SndrZbn8aa	It reminds me of the city, Camden, in New Jersey.

yoNXldH8aa	Some brands tend to leak from the top but my son was allergic to all brands but Huggies which sucks for us because they are one of the more expensive brands of diapers but oh well. My mom said I was allergic to everything but Huggies also so maybe its genetics? lol|`|qX3ixlNyaa	I am pregnant with my 5th and I prefer Huggies.|`|0cx4imxHaa	Pampers|`|OgzHcNMsaa	People like Pampers but when my daughter sleeps they leak at the top. Her Huggies havent leaked at all. However Pampers aremuch softer than Huggies and I've heard horrible diaper rash stories when dealing with huggies.|`|33O7ZTRRaa	I prefer both Huggies and Pampers, but you have to find what works best for your child.  I tried using Huggies and Pampers with my oldest, and he peed out of them, but did great with Luvs.  But when he got a little better he did fine with Huggies.<br>  With my 8 week old I've only used Huggies and Pampers and both work great for him, so far.<br>  <br>  I like Pampers Sensitive wipes the best.|`|qIWUC1Ceaa	i don't think it really matters on the brand, that just happens. My hubby had a diaper party and i have not had to buy diapers for six months so far. I have been using pampers swaddlers which is about the most expensive diaper out there and still have all kinds of leaks. When these diapers are gone i will just use what i can afford, they really are all the same. With my other three i pretty much used Luvs, so i will probably use them.|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	I love LUVS!! <br>  <br>  Before I started using Luvs, my son would leak out of the top of every diaper I tried. I was at the point were I would put a diaper on him normally, the wrap another diaper around his tummy (girdle-style) and then put training pants on him!! It was a nightmare!! I tried Luvs and we haven't had a leak yet!|`|Q49EEdzbaa	It doesnt matter what brand nowadays to use because diapers are so expensive and the ones with no brand name are just as good as the brand. With the off brand pampers; your baby can only wet them no more than twice; but how many times can they wet really without them letting you know one time is uncomfortable.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	All diapers work as long as your baby doesn't have sensitive skin,but to avoid leaks and for rashes,I prefer Pampers.
7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	No, it is great parenting, it teaches you a life lesson.  If you want something done, you have to do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Sit your sister down and say, I know you dont get how much I dont like you hitting me, so to prove it, when you hit me I am going to hit you twice as hard back until you learn.<br>  <br>  She will get the point.|`|vCSQnIlRaa	Hit her back she'll learn her lesson. I've learned the best way to learn or teach a lesson is to actually experience it. Leave a nice little bruise for her and I bet it will come to an end. If she don't stop your mom will have to if you both keep beating the crap out of each other.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Ah siblings..... hit her back and stop being a wuss.

Stand up for yourself.  Hit her back a couple times and she will stop.  Your mom is probably just tired of you two fighting.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Your sister is assaulting you.  If your Mom won't do anything about it, tell someone who will, like a police officer or teacher.  Both your sister and your Mom are doing something wrong.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Chances are if she confronts your sister, she's gonna keep doing the same thing so I think you should find a way to handle it yourself.|`|1neMZoRLaa	.maybe she wants you to settle your own differences? you gotta be more specifichow mcuh older is your sister?(or younger perhaps??)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	maybe you deserve it?

Ojgqd4xNaa	Try moving him around a little bit. Like kinda lift him so his body hangs slightly, and his torso is stretched.  That will allow the trapped air to move up, if it is stuck.  It helped my daughter to burp if I moved her around a little.  I've also read that carrying them around after will help, probably the same concept as moving them around!|`|deIzFnV8aa	It helped me to jiggle my daughter on my knee for a few seconds. I could actually hear the air coming into one big bubble and jiggling aroudn in there!  Then I burped her either over my shoulder, or by sitting her up and leaning her forward with a hand agaist her stomach. usually I got a burp much faster that way.  If you rub his back do it with an upward motion (as you probably already do).<br>  <br>  Anything that puts pressure on the tummy will help a burp come out, like tummy time or carrying them with an arm across their tummy. However, these things are more likely to bring up so spit up as well.<br>  <br>  Breastfed babies take in less air when they nurse, especially if they are quiet eaters, so there is not actually a burp to get out 100% of the time. That is part of why I liked the jiggilng method - I could usually hear if I needed to keep working at it or not.|`|dWJdUw8Qaa	Try moving him up and down like sit ups a little that normal helps us or I lay her across my legs and pat and move her legs a little.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	put him between your legs. Crunch his legs up and rest him on your one leg. then pat his back the legs up will put pressure on his belly and the same with laying him on your leg gives you a better postion to tap the gas out LOL
ay8tXLD2aa	I do have similar pain to what you describe, and saw my doctor for it months ago (my LO is 8 months now).  I delivered by c-section and I have massive build-up of scar tissue / adhesions from the surgery.  If you delivered by section, then it's something to think about...if not, no suggestions, but still DEF something to see your doc about.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You really should be asking your doctor this question.
S5GP2nlUaa	It's perfectly normal. All it is is your little girl getting ready to be born soon and her deciding what way to move about.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	sounds normal... I am about the same amount of weeks and have been having aches and pains as well. If you are really concerned contact your OB... good luck|`|JITTMjasaa	I'm not entirely sure but she could be dropping. The fact that your tight makes me worry a little though. Definitely contact your Dr... Congrads! Good luck, don't sweat the small stuff, God Bless
is132TSYaa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  It really depends where you got the electric shock from , and what its CURRENT was (not voltage). Serious electric shocks can however, affect unborn children if the current happens to pass through them.<br>  <br>  Not to worry though, If the shock entered through your hand it will immediately travel the quickest route to the insulation (ground) Biologically speaking it will travel up your arm then down your main vertabrae/spine. Thus avoiding the womb.<br>  <br>  Also as the shock continues the current becomes less strong and more unresponsive, therefore hardly any current (if any at all!) would enter your baby.<br>  <br>  Hope this Eases your Mind. And congratulations :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You may want to check with your doctor.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	it could, i would call your doctor and ask if you should get checked for that
3LEPfzVhaa	No, I think that's fine. Its almost what I would do if I was going somewhere. Its good to have a lot of time, in case something happens, plus it makes you more organised.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	How is going on the internet part of getting ready for your day? The rest seems reasonable enough.|`|BvHRriEyaa	If it works for you, I don't see the problem, it takes me about 3 hours just to wake up lol|`|jY31JaCeaa	why dont you pic out ur outfit the night before?  Thats what i do, so in the morning i just slip it on|`|vvBb1ZPjaa	ya. i get like 20 minutes.|`|22bkUtWNaa	I probably wouldn't do internet in the morning, but I guess that's a personal preference. I also think you probably won't spend as much time on choosing your outfit and getting dressed (10 minutes is a pretty long time), and I certainly don't take 20 minute showers, but maybe you do. Also, if I were tired, I probably wouldn't get out of bed by 8:05. It would be more like 8:20. So you might want to budget some time for snoozing.|`|788IKdCSaa	I think its all just fine, maybe a little long in the shower, just a little.<br>  And picking out your clothes before bed, works out better than in the morning. But 10 minutes picking out an outfit is very short compared to me, i spend like 15-20 minutes decideing. Haha.|`|Ciipqlcnaa	Yes it is a bit too long, maybe spend less time on your shower, also if you can pick your outfit when you go to sleep and lay it out on your chair so that you don't have to pick your outfit in the morning!<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  Byee|`|QH02h9REaa	I think that's too long. But then again i'm a dude, so i don't need make-up time and it takes about a minute or two to get dressed|`|lj3hNR9baa	As long as you get to your destination on time it's all good.|`|8rTHANk5aa	mabe take your shower at night and wash ur face in the morning.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	1. That is too darn long, to get up in the morning.  You should only take an hour.<br>  <br>  2. 30mins. on the Net, does not need to be part of your morning routine.<br>  <br>  3. No place in the routine, do you mention, brushing your teeth.<br>  <br>  I only take an hour<br>  <br>  1. 15mins. to shower<br>  2. 15mins. to get dressed<br>  3. 15mins. to take meds and, eat breakfast<br>  4. 15mins. to brush my teeth

vw201sblaa	some of them are ok. its names like shawniqua and crawlifawnda that get under my skin, the way you spelled emily was irritating, but simple changes like, Krystal for Crystal, or Tomas for Thomas, or Stephany for Stephanie are ok. its the outrageously different ones that annoy people|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I don't think uniquely spelt names are necessary. Whats wrong with the classic way? It doesn't make them seem more original, names are spoken more than they are written. If a unique name is necessary I think it is much better to look to other cultures and use one of their names!|`|QkwVDpPjaa	i like the original ones,<br>  i've seen jayke for jake<br>  and emely for emily<br>  my daughters called stephanie and my sister thought we would spell it<br>  stephny i think thats just short + ugly..<br>  i agree with the first post it seems to be the young mothers trying to call their children unusual names.|`|JvBGKmpyaa	I really don't like them.

tivpa7Vlaa	i guess the extra discharge that comes with being in the last trimester get too much air contact. how about u lay off the liners(could be harboring bacteria that makes the vagina smell) for a while just wear cotton panties and use baby wipes every time u use the bathroom. try to change underwear 3times a day after freshing up down there. if u are having sex tell hubby not to come in you even though the sperm can help activate labor. try other options.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	There is nothing wrong at all.

E2UXN7J1aa	Agreed. It just really upsets me when I see people saying that it is abuse. That is not abuse at all. I have seen abuse and swatting your kid on the bottom when they just won't respond to other forms of punishment is not even close.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	I completely agree with you.<br>  Your argument is well-worded, and pretty much how I myself have been feeling about the topic.<br>  <br>  My first form of discipline will not be spanking, I am going to try other methods first, and hope that they will work for me.<br>  <br>  I will not completely shun the idea of spanking, it has worked for generations before, and no child has ever died from an ever-so-slight tap on the butt.<br>  <br>  Call me old fashioned, but these days there is a significant increase in the number of young out of control children, and vandals.<br>  I DO think this is a productive of 'tough love' being outlawed.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	I think spanking is lazy because its the "easy quick-fix option"<br>  I would rather come up with some other way <br>  for e.g putting the child in a naughty spot whenever he/she misbehaves<br>  It might take longer, but worth the wait as once the child has calmed down they apologize and give a hug most of the time<br>  Have you watched supernanny? it is a good example of other techniques<br>  I think its best for another option and spanking should ONLY be a last resort.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I am anti-spank and I would not call an anti-spank mum 'lazy', it is down to each parent to choose how they punish their child and it isn't down to me or anyone else to judge them.<br>  <br>  Anti-spank parents can't be called lazy either, they seek other methods to punish their children, which isn't lazy.<br>  <br>  I think spanking is just a heated topic on here, it is very easy for people to get wound up about it.|`|5nwDq07Uaa	As a grown up 21 year old (well, I hope I am) who was brought up in a spanking household, I know there were some definite pros and cons. As a pro, when I got in trouble, my Dad swatted me with a wooden spoon and boy oh boy I never ever did that again! <br>  <br>  But my mother really had some trouble controlling herself. Once I didn't do enough piano practice and she practically took the spanking thing too far and I ended up with bruises. As a teenager and an adult, I'd love to enjoy playing the piano but I just can't anymore out of fear. It's a debilitating thing to have in the back of your mind...
fBGIUSfaaa	breastfed or bottle fed? breast really shouldnt be a problem.. it its colic you would definately know about it as she would have a certain time of just crying-sometimes for hours and usually at night. if bottle fed perhaps switch formula.. by the way at that age perfectly normal for her to poop for every feed she has as digestive system is still getting used to food. and they are fine to be runny as she is not actually eating food she is having liquid. The colour should tell you if there is anything wrong with her tummy.<br>  Also if you are breastfeeding, be careful with onions and other gas producing foods as this will be passed on to your bub as well... i found out the night i ate coleslaw.... lots of gas for bub. id take it easy on the infacol as it could all be perfectly natural depending on what is going into her system.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	best person to talk to and ask these questions is baby's doc...don't take answers from YA; hth, gl|`|hWe8vhKKaa	she could be colic try giving her boiled cooled water just a oz hopefully it should help.it helped my baby<br>  <br>  wish you all the best|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	It probably is colic.  Lay her on her back and softly bring her knees towards her belly.  Kind of a soft rocking motion.  That will help loosen the muscles in her tummy and relieve the gas.  You can also buy a small hot water bottle. (not a heating pad)  They are made out of soft rubber, that you can fill them with warm water.  Lay her so her tummy rests on top of it.  While she lays on top of the bottle softly rub her back. This too will relax those little tummy muscles.  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Z5Ut2ZSzaa	My baby is the same all the wind comes out the wrong end.<br>  I put it down to colic so tried giving her infacol but it only made things worse.<br>  I stopped giving her it and just try rubbing her belly and back quite often, i also lie her on her back and move her legs in a cycling motion this helps to relive the wind.<br>  she still burst out crying with a big scream for no reason at all but not willing to try infacol again.|`|ePhsBJE5aa	she might be suffering from colic,this is because of breast feeding you might be eating appetite that is rich in proteins and other ingredients.I hope this may help.|`|5bcd24aaf56518f68f3b66519c581d5caa	it probably is or her food is not agreeing with her i would talk to her doctor. Maybe you could try putting her on your lap tummy side down and pat her a little bit. that may make her tummy feel better. I would defentily talk to her doctor about this.|`|dN8qDAPSaa	<a href="http://answerall.kickme.to" rel="nofollow">http://answerall.kickme.to</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.
HSe6n5Tlaa	You are wrong.  I am Caucasian and was born with eyes so dark brown, they look black in my baby pictures.  My husband had one son before we were together who was born with dark eyes.  But our two children were born with blue eyes, although they did keep them. They are 2 and 3 now and both still have big blue eyes!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	You are wrong. MANY caucasions are born with brown or green eyes!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I did not misunderstand the question, some babies are born with blue eyes and then they may or may not change to a darker color. But many babies are born with dark eyes.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Most caucasian babies have kind of dark slate blue eyes when they are born, and then they gradually change to the color they will be for the rest of the person's life.<br>  I think the other responders have misunderstood your question.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	Most babies are born with brown eyes w/ a tint of blue color, then the eye color changes.|`|TontucbDaa	You can have any color eyes! All about the genes...|`|hrMhhB4Saa	my son is full white and his eyes werre BLACK when he was born.. he;s not 9 months and still a very very very dark brown|`|6hA0O06xaa	Your mother porbably just forgot.  I am pretty sure most caucaision babies are born with dark blue or grayish blue eyes.  Blue is actually from an absense of pigment in the part of the eye you can see.  The channels through which the pigment (if there is going to be any) travels to the outer layer of the eye aren't formed until the baby is older.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	My son was born with eyes so dark blue they were almost brown. <br>  <br>  BUT your mom may just not really remember :)  Babies eyes can change color very quickly after birth so maybe yours changed very fast.|`|qI5W6eyjaa	Yes, There is a med that Dr.s use that changes there eye color to blue, but it dose go back to there normal color over time.|`|qJBMdL7gaa	I was born with brown eyes :)
on5NQxhkaa	He's struggling with whether or not he believes in God... maybe the way the pastor spoke to him about God made him start to question if he was really an athiest. He is obviously angry because his mom is sick and that's why he was lashing out at God. That's a common thing to do.<br>  <br>  Religion isn't black and white.. some people have more faith than others, some go back and forth between what they believe, some just don't know. He is trying to find out what he believes, and I would suggest you just be there to talk to him if he needs it.<br>  <br>  Personally I am an athiest but I have gone through times of belief and doubt about God over the years so I kinda get what this kid is feeling. I lost my dad to cancer when I was 19 so I know what it's like to be angry that someone you love has to be the one to suffer.. it's just a tough situation.<br>  <br>  I wish him and you the best.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	He's not Atheist. I think he's angry at God because he thinks He did this to his mother. You can try talking to him. Tell him it's not God's fault.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	its common when some one is sick to either turn away from god, or go to him. Keep making go to church if that helps him.|`|9Z31gnvKaa	he is obviously confused, i have been at that point before and my father was a preacher. Luckily i reached the age of reason and sorted out my beliefs. although my parents werent ill, and that would have made it worse. <br>  <br>  Maybe try sitting down and talking to him straight up, ask him what he believes or if he dosnt know what to believe, hopefully he will open up and shed some light on the matter. If he has no one to talk to maybe thats why he's contradicting himself, maybe he just needs somone to help release all the built up emotions. That was probably why he said that about the pastor, just needed somone to talk to him.<br>  <br>  Oh and i wouldnt try to force/persuade him on a certain religion that will not help at all lol.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I know exactly what this kid is feeling. Im 14, my mum is critically ill with type 1 Diabetes and has been given until June to live. My dad died when I was 3.<br>  <br>  Over the past 18months or so I have really started questioning my beliefs due to what has happened to myself and my family, because isnt God supposed to be this wonderful person who creates miracles and saves people and things. When something goes right, everyone wants credit and everyone wants responsibility, nobody thanks God. However when something goes, well.. wrong, people dont want responsibility for that and they wont take credit for it, they automtically look for someone to blame, and of course that blame is landed on God. <br>  At the moment he is just trying to figure this out, that God does not have control over everything, he chooses when we are born and when we die, but he does not choose how or why. You need to explain to this boy this, that there is a time for everyone to be born and a time for everyone to die, so it may be a little sooner than wanted, there isnt anything you can do about it, just enjoy the time you still have.<br>  <br>  I have a twin sister who is now also "atheist" or so she says, and I think that it may be for the same reason, she doesnt know how to handle life as it comes and goes. He will mature and he will learn to understand.<br>  <br>  "Every song has a CODA, a final movement, and ending. Whether it crashes out or fades away.. every song must end, but is that any reason not to enjoy the music"<br>  Think about that quote.<br>  <br>  EDIT - oh and do not try and convince him that he's not atheist, ask him if he would like to come with you to church, and if he says no, then say something like "thats ok, i respect your decision" he will come round eventually, in the mean time you have to respect that he has a lot going on.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AjqO1aJgaa	How can you help him? Get him Pastor Gerry's phone number.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter right now what he believes. It only matters that he has someone he's comfortable talking to.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Sounds like he is angry and confused.  He says he is an atheist because he can't/doesn't want to believe in a god that would cause/allow is mom to be so ill.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should worry about or push the issue of faith.  Just be as supportive as you can.  Since he liked talking to the pastor, maybe you should arrange for the two of them to talk more . . . maybe have weekly discussions or something.  It could really help him out.  Don't force it though.  If he doesn't want to talk to the priest, don't make him.|`|rBq189W1aa	Jesus Christ woman, how dense are you? He sees 'God' as taking away his mother, of course he's going to reject 'God'!<br>  <br>  You can help him by letting him talk to you about stuff. Instead of constantly butting heads with the kid and trying to make him do everything your way when his mother is dying, try to work *with* him to get through this.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	You received good answers from others here. I am only posting because it has to be said: MrMike, you are the reason that so many people are completely revolted by "atheists". Good job proving atheism as the breeding ground of ignorance and immorality.<br>  <br>  Edit: I would add one more thought. It's OK to blame God. We all do, many times for many things. Trust me, He can handle it...He's a big boy. The Biggest, in fact.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Key words here he "says" he is an atheist... I'm going to admit that i went through a period in my life where i called myself one at about that age too, it was shortly after my great grandmother had died. He's going through some things that he doesn't understand, it is a stage that he is going through. Honestly the best thing you can do since he is so curious is give him a bible to read... Sometimes people have to just read for themselves what it says instead of having others "preach" to them what they think certain things mean.<br>  It worked for me at least..|`|qRElKKjXaa	I'm 17 and about half the kids I know have been "atheist" or "agnostic" at one point. In a way it's a trend like skinny jeans. <br>  <br>  He probably feels confused about God, and betrayed by him. His mom sounds like a devout believer and is probably a good woman, and he feels like a just God wouldn't give her such a horrific disease. Instead of admitting hurt or anger or outrage, which shows your vulnerability, it's easier to just say that you don't believe in God. <br>  <br>  I think he does believe, and he is just overwhelmed and freaking scared out of his mind. One of my best friend's is dealing with her mom's cancer right now, and her younger sister is also suddenly atheist. It's a coping mechanism. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could talk with the Pastor and ask if he'd be willing to meet with Sammy once a week or so, not to preach, but to listen, advise and support. You might also want to see if there is an adolescent therapist he could talk to. He needs to have a safe place to express all his emotions - to cry it out, be angry, be scared - everything. Also see if there is a sport or fun activity, like an art class if he likes painting, that he could do after school to have a healthy distraction from his grief everyday.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, avoid talking about religon with him too frequently because if you talk about it too much he might think you don't respect his viewpoint or are forcing your beliefs on him, and he'll likely be resentful. Listen to him if he wants to talk about it, but don't pressure. And most 14 year olds can stay at home alone for a couple of hours. <br>  He will sort out his religious beliefs in time. <br>  <br>  I hope your friend gets well.
cEgI5ogLaa	My first pregnancy I was showing around 16 weeks, my second I was showing around 13 weeks. I have had friends whose pants didn't button anymore by 2 months pregnant, every pregnancy is def. different. My 2 have been polar opposits and they are both girls! lol.<br>  Congrats to you and good luck, Toni Lynne|`|ntdGOZqGaa	With my second I got a bump around 14-16 weeks. With this one oh lordy I'm not joking I was showing by 2 months and it wasnt water or bloating bc I'm still huge lol. Every pregnancy is different and every women is different. Hope this helps|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I actually started showing at 3 months.|`|ROJans2Taa	I guess around 3 mths, only I could really notice it, no one else, by I guess 4-5 mths I really sort of popped where people were asking, one girl I work with who I hadn't told and is very blunt, told me when I was 3 mths maybe I should take up walking again since it looks like Ive put on a few pounds,lol. I told her shortly after why I was getting "chubby" best luck and congrats
WoxMH0wZaa	Have them over for dinner. and during a lull (perhaps while you are getting ready to serve dessert or something) just tell them you want to ask them something, and then say what you told us. Just say something like, "I think you are really great parents, very intelligent, and have strong values which is very important to me, so I wanted to ask you if you might be interested in being godparents for my child?" chances are they will be flattered you asked and say yes. good luck!|`|giKCTfnfaa	invite them over for a nice dinner.  over dinner, ask them and state the reasons you put in your question (strong christians and good morals and values).  i'm sure they would be honored.|`|dPxcoeP0aa	start off by telling them how you trust them, and you see them as very caring people. and if something would ever happen to you, you would want your child to be safe, and with family. and you see how they both are, very responsible. then start saying how you know if you would be killed or critically hurt, you would want them to be there for your child. and if they would.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	I would meet up with them somewhere..at their house or go out to eat...sit down with them and just start explaining how you feel..let them know you would be very grateful and happy for them to be the godparents of your child! good luck|`|jgtfWjE4aa	meet them in person and bring it up casually into the conversation.<br>  <br>  they would be flattered, i'm sure!<br>  <br>  i'm glad you're picking good people.|`|ObkOzJpSaa	just talk about parenting and support and just bring it up
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I'm on the other end of this, I am a step mom to a 6 year old girl. I have been with her dad for 4 years. She calls me mommy. She knows she has 2 mommies. Her dad and mom have joint, even though we have her more. Her mom absolutely HATES me. She's totally jealous of the relationship I have with her daughter. She refuses to talk to me and is rude to my fiancee when I'm around (like when we pick her up or drop her off)  I hope eventually she will understand that I love her daughter like she is my own.|`|AA12175970	I like my ex's girlfriend. She seems to balance him out. At least, he has held a job since he's been with her.  And he has been paying child support since they got together. They only see my daughter once every several months, so I have no reason to be threatened by her. I wouldn't anyway, though, as I am remarried and happy and I hope they will be very happy also.|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	i have mixed feelings cause my ex likes to start crap|`|E7trCwHOaa	IMO any mother who says she's not at all threatened is lying.  There will always be a small part of me that would rather snap a woman's neck than see her 'acting' my role in any form.  That's terrible, yes.  But at least I'm honest.<br>  <br>  That being said, yes, I do respect the girlfriend, as much as I can.  Her lifestyle, maturity level, and drug use are not within the standard of people I generally befriend, but she's kind to me & my daughter, so I give kindness right back.  I respect her as a person, and for trying to be a good girlfriend, and for not trying to get involved in conversations about my daughter.<br>  <br>  She does not care for my child, though.  Their "extracurricular activities" have caused me to refuse to let my ex take my daughter anywhere without me.  They can come see us, but my daughter's not going anywhere with them.  For the most part, yes, I'm fine with the way that she treats my daughter.  Except for the smoking in front of her, which makes me very angry.|`|N5rS9A9paa	Mom for over 27 years now.  I have lots of children, natural, foster & adopted.  I am also a single mom.  I have never had a problem with insecurities with the other "moms".

Not what you wanted to hear, huh?<br>  <br>  The other women vocally appreciate what I have done with the kids.  So, more it's like they respect me.  I appreciate the fact that they do love and care for the kids when they are around them.  Otherwise they wouldn't be seeing them at all!|`|VZmaDZjVaa	well my child lives more with my ex husband and his new wife.  I am fine to her I say Hi and am totally nice to her but she is such a B@#$% to me.  I have done nothing wrong to her my son or my ex.  I have no idea what her problem is.  The most important thing for me to do is never let my son know I don't care for her.  I keep my emotions to myself.  It's best that the children don't get inbetween and hear negative things about their parents they will resent you for it.  I am very happy that they are doing a good job with my son and he seems to like her but her main problem is with me I guess she just doesn't like me because I was with HER man for 11 years lol whatever she needs to get over it we both are married now and need to move on.|`|4504a9128e8081cf927e43ed902520d1aa	im a stepmom and at first there was insecurities on both our parts (my boyfriend was only introduced to his girl at a year and a half) but now we get along better than my boyfriend and his ex, i do most of the pick up/ drop off. although sometimes i know that she is jelous becasue her daughter is more comfortable with me cuz im there more, but i actually know that she is gratefull, becasue when she gave her girl over to my boyfriend (she was struggling finacially etc.) i helped him a lot and he most likely wouldnt have been able to handle it himself|`|667822ca57e3ce38e958dbffbebfb566aa	Be happy loving & positive or your child will pick up the negativity.

So now I'm remarried and have a third and my first two don't even know they have a sperm donor. Hell he won't even work so he doesn't have to pay child support. But when I saw him 3 weeks ago he wouldn't say hi kiss my a$$ or even look at his kids.<br>  <br>  I think each situation is as unique as the people involved in it.|`|BOWVGCHnaa	I am a stepmom to a 17 & 12 yr old.  The first year my husband & I were together, his ex-wife was totally nasty to me.  She eventually apologized to me & told me she was wrong to behave the way she did.  We got along great for a few years.  Now, once again, for no reason at all, she hates me.  It's a roller coaster ride with her.  It shouldn't bother me, but it does.  She's turned the kids against me.  We were once close.   I would just like to say to all of the bio-moms reading this;  I understand that you may be hurt that your relationship didn't work.  I can understand that you don't want someone trying to take your place w/ the kids.  Not all of us are like that.  Think for a minute that maybe we genuinely love these kids & want to do right by them.  Isn't it better that we all get along & the kids have one more person to love them?|`|BykL0txuaa	I don't even know my ex's girlfriend or wife as the dad hasn't bothered to be involved in my children's lives.<br>  <br>  IF they were, however, and the girlfriend or wife cared about my children, I'd be happy.  Would make it less of a burden to worry about them if they were visiting their father.  If I knew the female of that house cared about the welfare of my children, I'd feel more at ease.  I think I would only be threatened if I happened to still want the man for some reason (which I don't) or if she acted like the better mother since I hate people who try to look down on others.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, what would I care as long as my kids were safe and cared for?|`|jRDgej0Xaa	I am a step-mom and honestly tried to get along with his ex BUT she felt threatened by my realtionship with her daughter, so we do not get along.

Your baby deserves to have both parents.|`|thLgiy2Eaa	Ok, My son's father is married to the woman he had a child with at 17, they broke up for a long time (8 years) and in that time he wasn't able to do much for that boy, when we got together we started taking his son every other weekend, and I did everything for him. When his mother said he needed clothes, I bought them. When she said she had no food in her fridge, I gave her a gift card to the grocery store! I made her son a part of my family in the three and a half years I was with this guy, then I get pregnant and tried to show her that we wouldn't forget about her son and she caused a scene at my baby shower (shouldn't have invited her i know) after 9 months of being parents together he ran off on  me and married her, now she won't let him call, and she won't let him be a part of our son's life. I have absolutely no respect for her what so ever, and none for him either, because if he was any kind of man he would stand up and be a father no matter what she says.

okUzIvMVaa	you should do a scary movie night if there is going to be boys and girls at the party. because at this age, they of course have feelings for each other, or at least think they do, and the most that they are going to do during a terrifying movie is scream, and maybe hold hands! and they will all be in the same room, so you dont really have to worry about them doing something you dont want them to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  if its all girls- you could have everyone bring in stuff to decorate tee shirts with. and you would provide the shirts. alot of fabric glue type stuff, or sparkley stuff would work. you know, wahatever. and they wil have fun doing it, and that can be something for the guests to take home. while the shirts are drying watch "chick flicks" like a walk to remember or maybe mean girls or something.  <br>  <br>  <br>  either way, just make shur theres lots of food and pop!<br>  <br>  =]|`|jchCJZxTaa	I had the best 13th birthday party last year<br>  People are still talking about it and it was in MAY!<br>  what i did was<br>  - we have a small backyard<br>  - we hired a marquee<br>  - we hired a juke box<br>  - and got all our friends to bring plastic chairs<br>  - the party was based in my garage<br>  - we hired a disco ball<br>  - we had a fridge with many drinks in it<br>  - and cranked up the music <br>  - it went for 2-3 hours but i think it should have gone longer<br>  and people are still trying to beat my 2008 party <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  and happy birthday to your to be 13yr old|`|5lXouSKAaa	It doesn't necessarily have to be a theme.

If it's nice out, outdoor parties are always fun. I'd suggest going out to dinner maybe, with her friends and letting them sit at a different table on the other side of the restaurant to make her feel older and more responsible. Then, after, you can have all her friends come over for a big sleepover. Good luck and have fun with it!
JGpirCtLaa	It's because there's 10 Emily's and one Emmaleigh.<br>  It's also a lot cuter. I like Leigh a lot better than Ly.<br>  I love unique spellings because they make you unique.<br>  I know a girl named Meghan and that's such a common name, but nobody else we know spells it like her, so everyone calls her Meghan with an H.

s8VY7uReaa	If possible, you should avoid taking other medicines, or herbal remedies, with the contraceptive pill. If a health professional prescribes medicine for you, you should always tell them if you're taking the pill. This is because some medication can affect the way that the pill works.<br>  <br>  Antibiotics can affect how oestrogen (the active ingredient in the contraceptive pill) is absorbed into your body. This can make the pill less effective, and you'll need to use an additional form of contraceptive, such as a condom. You should use the additional form of contraceptive while you're taking antibiotics, and for one week after you stop.<br>  <br>  There are two main types of pill. The first is the monophasic, or phasic pill, which you take for 21 days, and then take no pills for the next seven days.<br>  <br>  The second is the 'Everyday' pill, where there are 21 active pills and seven inactive pills which don't contain any hormones (placebos). These look different to the active pills. You take one pill a day for 28 days - three weeks on the active pill, and one week on the inactive pill, with no break between packets.<br>  <br>  If you're taking monophasic, or phasic pills, and you get to the end of your packet, while you're taking antibiotics, don't have the usual seven day break. Start your new pill packet straight away.<br>  <br>  Similarly, if you're taking the Everyday pill, while taking antibiotics, and you get to the end of your active pills, don't take the seven day course of inactive pills. Start a new course of active pills.<br>  <br>  If you're taking antibiotics during the first seven days of your new pill packet, and you've had sex within the last 5-7 days, you should seek medical advice because you may also need emergency contraception. This is because the antibiotics may have disrupted the normal protection provided by your pills, and there is a chance that you might have become pregnant|`|rJgrwIodaa	The same percentage as it would be if you weren't taking the pill.  Antibiotics completely nullify birth control pills.  That's why your doctor will tell you to use condoms or other forms of protection if you're on the pill and have to take antibiotics.<br>  You could get pregnant from having unprotected sex just once if you're taking antibiotics while using the pill.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	That is what happened to me thanks to a very poor GP who told me that amoxicillin for my kidneys would have no effect (she has now 'retired')-although I am glad now as I have a wonderful daughter.<br>  <br>  I have searched online for a percentage and likelihood but I couldn't find one, but going by my own case I would say it is likely...however it may not happen to all women, but the risk should not be taken if you don't want to fall pregnant.<br>  <br>  If you take antibiotics doctors recommend that you use condoms for the time that you are and for 7 days afterwards.|`|lwlZMhiqaa	Certain antibiotics make the pill ineffective.  So if you don't want to get pregnant use backup methods of birth control.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Well it depends on the dosage of your antibiotics and your BC pills.  But it's a lot more likely then just being on the pill.  That why it says when on antibotics be sure to use another form of BC other then the pill.|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	that's how I ended up with my gorgeous nephew my sis in law mixed both and fell pregnant.  Use condoms if you are going to have sex will taking them.  Your doctor should have explained this to you in the first place since it will say on your file you are on the pill god damn N.H.S!!!|`|PLgNsOF9aa	It's likely because something in the antibiotics cancel out your b/c so its like not taking the pill sort of. I know of someone that had a baby a few months ago because she got pregnant taking antibiotics for a tooth she had pulled or something. She was on the pill just forgot about how it was to be affected by antibiotics..|`|claUGpVRaa	Don't know the percentage but it is a possibility!<br>  Sometimes it is antibiotics that can make the pill not work, other times just vomiting can affect it too (I fell pregnant while on the pill after being sick and throwing up one or two, not sure)<br>  <br>  If you are on the pill and have to take antibiotics then make sure you use another form of contraception as well for the duration + a few days to be on the safe side.|`|zY9PdRGjaa	dont know the percentage but i can tell you that that is how my cousin got pregnant!!!|`|4wnn2GbYaa	yes i does so don't sleep with anyone....if u do use protection  ok.... so about 100%
723QHuicaa	From your profile -<br>  About me: I am a mother of two teenage boys and a very attractive new step son. I am pregnant again with my new hubby :] <br>  <br>  <br>  So... 2 teenage boys, 1 stepson, another baby stepson (unless its the baby you refer to attractive, which kinda freaks me out) plus one new born.<br>  <br>  Sorry, dont believe you.

Uh, no i don't think you should for two reasons. A, he probably won't take it since he isn't used to it and B, your new mik is for your new baby who needs all of it so he can grow big and strong. <br>  It does seem a bit strange, but then again, wet nurses were doing this with complete strangers years and years ago so what is the real difference? You may come up against some bias on the subject but if baby thrives still and the 9 mth old is happy i guess there is nothng truly wrong with it|`|a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	no but if his been bottle fed i doubt he will know how to breast feed.|`|tkqGwbtHaa	no, women actually do that a lot. surrogacy.|`|qZml9VRmaa	no i dont think there would be a problem with that...

Tell her she has only been on this planet for seven years and the last thing she needs to worry about is whether or not her butt looks good. Dont even want to imagine what else is going on.....|`|kJZsqC8uaa	So why ask if you already have an answer. Of course seven is too young it doesnt have to be sexual but health wise, she may not wear them right and that can cause yeast infections. why does a seven year old need to worry about a panty line?|`|MW3Br5V8aa	VERY inappropriate!! for u to even think its ok!! and she has a BF??? i wouldnt of even taught of her "parade them around for her boyfriend" thats horrible!|`|z0ro3VkJaa	**** no.<br>  <br>  **** no.<br>  <br>  **** no.<br>  <br>  How in the **** do you even have to question this?|`|vA5z3aPmaa	UMMM yeah, unless you are a whore raising a whore|`|nkSRIq0Iaa	Eww.. you suck! Thanks for the points though <3|`|0MA0wEDMaa	ugh i dont even know what those (pantylines g strings) are and im 13!?!?!?!|`|kprKXEOSaa	You're either a troll, or completely insane.<br>  G-strings aren't healthy, the string being right up against the rectum and rubbing back and forth increases the risk of vaginal and urinary tract infections.  They aren't healthy for adults, and they are certainly a terrible choice for a little girl.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	"her boyfriend will not see them"?!

3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	It does sound like constipation.   Have you added anything new to his diet recently?<br>  Adding extra fluids will help.  You can use plain water if he will drink it, or dilute prune juice.  If he's eating solids, avoid apple juice and bananas for a while - the pectin in these fruits is binding.<br>  Tummy rubs will help, and if you get desperate, you can try rectal stimulation.  Use a rectal thermometer with lubrication on it.

VMASMHX6aa	I'm afraid that whenever that's happened to me it's turned out to be pre-menstral spotting and my period has arrived before too long.|`|tSKBsbIyaa	Yes my friend,<br>  Me too in d same situation last month. I did my IUI and then faced the same thing. Little late after my regular dates and that too with light pinkinsh and redish spotting on first two days then again third day was little more bleeding n then forth almost gone.<br>  But my bad luck, i checked lately which shows negative.<br>  In short you should not conclude, do your test after a week, if you are not following any special treatment for TTC. That will give you the true result. ill then all the best.<br>  Take care<br>  Baby showers on you.. :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The price of the test means nothing. I tested positive 4 days before my period was due with a dollar store test. The type of test means nothing. They are all FDA approves and therefor work.<br>  <br>  With that said it's possible to not get a positive until a week after your period was due (if not a little later). Just hang in there and keep testing. The pregnancy hormone doubles every 48-72 hours so it would be safe to test again in a few days.

SRzswqTeaa	I tried to do some research for this question!  I'm sure if I looked I might be able to find something, but it is not an easy thing to make a study of I'm sure.  I know a lot of women who were effaced by 36 weeks, even dilated - and still went to 40 or more weeks.  I really can't give a number, but it is pretty common.  Unfortunately, neither effacement OR dilation will give any indication of when a woman will go into labor.  Some women dilate up to 4 cm and become 100% effaced, and walk around that way for a month.  Some women are not dilated and effaced at all, and hours later they give birth. So as you can see, this is something that would be very hard to do a study on.  You should easily make it to term, and don't worry about your due date too much.  Baby will come when he/she is done cooking :-)|`|Axcy1DYlaa	I dont know...but if it makes you feel better I'm 36wks on Tuesday and not effaced at all. Asked him "what does that mean exactly?" He said "you're right on schedule!" <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

lJf6pSbaaa	i disagree with dumplingmuffin.. do NOT tell her its special beer. she will be asking for it in public and that could get you into big trouble.. and i mean BIG. so dont do that. keep it out of reach.. or put it in a cup l ike somone said.. try to divert her from the beer by making her a different snack.. like mabye you should have apple slices and caramel [lowfat] or baby carrots.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	You can get into big trouble and have her taken away for this. Why is it in her reach? I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING A (oops sorry) 2 year old is asking for beer? Dont repremand her after all is it her fault she got into your beer? are you old enough to drink beer? Maybe she would be better off with someone else like your parents. You need to put on your big girl panties and be a responsible mother.|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	a 2 year old asking for beer????<br>  <br>  Yeah your a terrible mom.I drink socially but never around my kids.And if i was to i sure wouldn't teach her what it is.And beer is nasty i seriously don't see a 2 year old enjoying it, FAKE maybe??|`|AA11383122	as everyone else said WHY was the beer in a place that she can reach it. Are you sure you are mature enough to take care of your child.. Also how does your child know what beer is called. Also what is a 19 year old doing drinking|`|nDEVWjCEaa	My husband has given my daughter a sip of beer ( i gave him BIG crap for it) but i can't say that she asked for it after wards.. In canada the legal drinking age is 19 so if that's where your from you are of age but other countries i don't know..<br>  Try not to drink in front of her anymore... out of sight out of mind... <br>  but I don't agree with giving her her own "special beer" that will just encourage her more..<br>  I don't think you are a bad mother... just in a bad situation<br>  Oh and stop spoiling her yes that may be part of the problem.... a 19 month old DOESN'T need to have everything she wants...|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I personally don't drink in front of my child but then yet again that's me. I'm like that because I had an alcoholic for a father. If you are going to have a beer whats wrong with waiting until she is asleep or pouring it into a cup that she cant see what it is. Also I would explain to her that is something she cant have bc she isn't an adult and plus its nasty or something. But if you tell her its nasty you cant sit there and drink it in front of her, bc she sees you guys drinking it so then she thinks she is able to have some too. Good luck|`|IRZWz2HIaa	Well to be honest if you have a 2 year old daughter and your a single mom maybe you should consider not having beer in the house. She is young enough now to not really understand, but  it will get worse as she gets older. She needs to be around it at some point in her life, so when she gets freedom she doesnt drink like crazy. But with a child of 2 yrs of age in the house its best to keep it out. I know that sounds hard, but its the best way.|`|AA10063059	can you not give her some fizzy lemonade occasionally ,and pretend its her special beer,at the age of 2 she shouldnt be able to tell the difference and at that age everything is a game amyway|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Don't put beer anywhere she can get to it. Or better yet, don't have any at all.|`|V3ZyGJMtaa	For one thing i hope you have learned something from all this. But as for getting her to stop for one thing you need to get the beer out of you house is somebody hears her and reports you you could have somebody showing up at your door and they will take her also you could go to jail for it.... Once you loose your baby its hard as hell to get her back i have a friend still fighting for hers. And second just act like you dont understand what she asking for. My son went to his grandpartents house for the weekend and come home saying a not so nice world and everytime he said it we asked him what he was saying after a few day and getting really upset nobody knew what he was telling us he stop as if it was baby talk and hasnt said it since. As long as you are getting on to her or acting on her doing it she going to keep on just to get the reaction out of you if nothing else. If she only had a sip one time she doent know what it is she just knows you wont let her have it anymore.. BUT I SAY AGAIN THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE IT IN YOU HOUSE WITH A SMALL CHILD MUCH LESS WITH YOU BEING UNDER AGE YOURSLEF... You might not be getting judged for what you did but you can be judged for what you doing now. I understand you did some not so smart things at 17 but its time to make up for it now and be who your little girl needs you to be...|`|eiLwwbw9aa	you should not drink in front of her... <br>  <br>  if you do put in a cup that she wont know what it is...<br>  <br>  a spanking on her butt/ a little pop on her mouth wont kill her and maybe she needs you to give her some discipline in that way... i dont like to do it either but they learn fairly fast<br>  <br>  right now she is at the age where she is testing your and her boundaries... she needs to learn which she can and can not do...<br>  <br>  forget about spoiling her... there is a time a place for rewards....<br>  <br>  my husband is the good guy and i am the bad guy... it sucks but someone has got to lay down the law or you will be walked all over and be humiliated when you are out in public because her behavior wont stop there..<br>  <br>  o and i noticed with my babies that if they are on a schedule(sleep, eating, etc) they tend to behave better... <br>  <br>  i hope this is somewhat helpful
VMASMHX6aa	I'd recommend you go to www.fertilityfriend.com and sign up for a free account.<br>  <br>  There is a MASS of free info on that site including an e-mail course that you can sign up for that tell you everything you need to know about temping.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	If your period is 7 days late, then go ahead and take a home pregnancy test!!!  <br>  <br>  For BBT Charting - you have to use a basal thermometer or a digital thermometer that reads to the tenths.  Take your temp 1st thing as soon as you wake up, before you even get out of bed.  You also need to take it at the same time every morning.  Record you temps every day starting from the day you complete your period.  During your fertile time, you should see a rise in your temp. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Loads of Baby Dust!!! <br>  <br>  BBT is great for finding out your most fertile time and ovulation, but not so great for finding out if you are pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  I use fertilityfriend.com to track mine....and they have alot of info and directions.  I use the free service, and don't pay for the full use of the website.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i am doing it for the first time and i am surprised to see the variation in temp. i use digital  thermometer early in morning without moving, eating or talking. then i am plotting it on 2 graphs which i printed and on 3 websites.<br>  so in the follicular phase the temp is on lower side, then around ovulation it will go down and then AFTER ovulation it will go really high called thermal shift. then for next 2 weeks or so it will remain high. if it is high eve when AF is supposed to comee this shows u r pregnant otherwise just before AF arrives it will go down again. the length of this after ovulation high temp shold be more then atleast 10. if remains high for 18 days or so then u r pregnant.<br>  Baby dust :)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	To be honest I hated taking my temperatures...it actually stressed me out more because of trying to make sure it was taken at the same time and trying to interpret the readings.  So I stopped doing that and opted for checking my cervix and fluids...you can do it anytime of day and is more accurate.  Once i got fertile fluids and my cervix was really high (almost to where I couldn't feel it) and soft I knew it was time to start having sex.  And it worked.

And have him step out of the room at some point so she can tell you what the baby is.|`|an1b4pXxaa	I never understand how people can think that the baby's gender is a 'surprise'. Unless you are very unlucky and happen to have some sort of hermaphrodite there are only two choices, how surprising can that be?<br>  <br>  I think it is best that you know ahead of time and get mentally prepared, pick a name etc, the technology is there, you should use it.<br>  If your husband doesn't want to know don't tell him but I bet you can't go 20 weeks knowing without slipping a 'him' or a 'her' into the conversation. Lol.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I was in the same situation. We didn't find out at the ultrasound, but had the tech write the sex down and seal it in an envelope. Once it was sitting right there, and the temptation was greater for my husband as well, he decided we could open it. Actually, I was crying one night that I really wanted to know and he just went and got the envelope, unsealed it, and handed it to me with a smile. Once we opened it, he was glad we did. This time around there was no argument... We agreed to find out at the ultrasound. If that doesn't work for you, maybe he would agree to let you find out without telling him. It's really your choice. The tech this time asked me if I wanted to know, because she said it wasn't his choice... It was in me! :)|`|JFbWyKKDaa	I kinda didn't want to find out either, but then I thought it was better to find out because you can be more prepared to buy boys or girls stuff. You can always get unisex items tho... my son uses a pink bouncy seat we got from my sister's little girl. He doesn't know the difference and he's almost grown out of it.  Maybe your husband could walk out of the room for a second while the ultrasound tech tells you the sex of your child then you can keep it a secret until he/she is born so you both can be happy about the gender. It can work-don't give up.  See what he thinks about that. Congratulations on your new baby!|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Ask the sonographer to tell you in private. Although i know of many that won't tell you out loud if one partner doesn't want to know. They'll simply put the answer in an envelope, or use a code only you know. My hubby didn't want to find out the sex of our baby either. But the sonographer let it slip without thinking. By the time we discovered it was in fact a twin pregnancy he figured he already knew one was a boy, so he may as well know the sex of the other. If he'd had a choice he wouldn't have wanted to know as he wanted the surprise element. He's not disappointed at knowing 2 more males are joining the family though, so i really dont think it mattered, he was simply being difficult.. If your partner is that insistent on not knowing, Tell the sonographer beforehand, so she knows to tell you in private, or have him slip out the room or something. It would have been impossible if i knew and hubby didn't, because i know i'd let it slip accidentally. How do you go 20 weeks without mentioning "him" or "her"? However if your baby is anything like our second twin, it won't be an issue as they'll be a little exhibitionist and be in a legs splayed position putting everything on display..|`|mFQydvncaa	you find out and let him step out when she tells you! i know plently who have done that! you can prepare for the child in secret. I know people who purchased clothes and hid them in bags. Just so daddy got the suprise!<br>  <br>  I had to know because i am the type that needs to be ready! i hate babies in green and yellow so i was all about finding out!<br>  <br>  goodluck!
vACBeHSfaa	You can see cervical mucus again at the end of the cycle. It is usually because your progesterone is dropping. Progesterone is what dries up or thickens your cervical mucus. Once it stops being produced, you can see some of that mucus again. Unfortunately, it probably means your period is on its way. Sorry! :( I know that it sucks.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope you get your ++++++ soon!!|`|AA11079476	it can relate to ovulation|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	The discharge can definitely be because of Clomid, or any other hormone changes in your body.  It sounds like cervical fluid.  Clomid is supposed to stimulate your ovaries to produce an egg.  Normally during your cycle, you produce the discharge (cervical mucus) a little then, around ovulation.  The cervical mucus is supposed to help carry the sperm to your egg.  Maybe try taking a pregnancy test right now will help?  It's hard waiting to find out every month if you're pregnant, so if taking a quick pg test will help relieve a little of the tension I'd do it.  Good luck!|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	It sounds alot like ovulation. The message board TTC on www.whattoexpectwhenexpecting.com might help you out alot. I'm a member their and alot of people have your same issues.Seeing how your due for AF tomorrow not really sure if that could be it or not really~
zb5sSaGKaa	To be due on the 12th June 2009, you would be 25 weeks pregnant today and conceived around the 05/09/08 (depending on your cycle length). <br>  <br>  If at 24 weeks you was to have had a miscarriage it would be classed as a stillbirth, the baby would have been around 30 centimetres long and weighed around 600 grams so you would have noticed it (that's a lot bigger than a jelly-baby). Also at this stage the baby would have been viable, meaning you would need a birth and death certificate.<br>  <br>  Just noticed on your profile, you have asked the same question 5 times. You really need to get a life and grow up.
ZVUrLZpXaa	GET LOST YOU F - ING TROLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	I don't think the jelly baby is possible not unless you drank acid before it
9wtpCNb6aa	Hun, im really sorry to hear about your miscarriage.  i too have been through one and can completely understand how you feel.<br>  <br>  However, im a bit confused, you say you were 24 weeks pregnant when you miscarried?  Had the baby stopped growing much earlier do you know?  because at 24 weeks, your baby would be pretty much a fully formed baby, and certainly not the size of a jelly baby.  I was only 11 weeks when i miscarried and mine was how you have described yours.  <br>  <br>  Regarding the letter, im not sure you receive a letter or not.  i wouldnt imagine so.  I certainly didnt.  <br>  <br>  One thing i will say, is you should definitely attend some sort of councelling, its something i didnt have, and still to this day, if someone mentions it to me, i break down.  <br>  <br>  I hope your feeling ok, and just remember, everything happens for a reason.  This one was not meant to be.  Thats how i see it.  <br>  <br>  Take care hun x
cX5ctGSNaa	Only way to know is with a pregnancy test, some women still get a withdrawal bleed whilst pregnant (technically not a period, but still a light bleed) especially if on the pill due to the forced drop in hormones (when you take the hormone-free sugar pills) which signals the bleeding. A pregnancy test wont be affected by the pill, the HCG hormone is the one picked up in a pregnancy test, and is unlikely to be affected by the pill<br>  <br>  Although I still would say your chances are pretty low, considering you are on the pill and had a bleed.<br>  <br>  And the pill does NOT cause birth defects|`|VJiWuikpaa	if you think you are pregnant you should stop using the pill as  you could damage your baby|`|7a35e1d6e3906d179e99e16ca6707209aa	the chances are 99.9%|`|YjlU5Bqnaa	i wouldn't worry!|`|o9p5kn1Baa	very slim. your supposed to have that bleeding. ive been on Yaz for a year as well. as long as your taking it every day, at the same time, and not taking any other antibiotics that would decrease the effectiveness, your fine|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	That's nothing to worry about.

IqcQ7pnfaa	She keeps on touching her tummy. She was going crazy and all in front of her parents. She was having some pregnancy symptoms like morning sickness. The father of her child died. In the end, she regretted all the things she has done. <br>  DEFINITELY PREGNANT!|`|RwujkZeLaa	maybe|`|8rTHANk5aa	he gets her pregnant..dad makes him leave..he crashes and dies and the girl regrets everything
K1kZlWY8aa	I was the same way as you =).<br>  Just stay at school, it is the best thing to do. Once I had my daughter, my bf and I both moved into our own house and he is still at school while I am finishing my last year being self-educated, which may be a good idea.<br>  I work a part time job right now. I suggest giving up at least one of those jobs until you finish school.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun, having a baby is hard but so very, very fulfilling =).|`|01ntBgaPaa	Well I know that although school is important so is having money in the bank as well as not over-stressing myself. <br>  <br>  I had three options - Health - Work - School and decided that there was NO way i could to all three so i chose to continue working 1 job and do my schooling online. You may only need 4 credits to graduate but to you have the right classes so you can walk the stage?<br>  <br>  I say work for as long as you can and take care of your health and the babies. Although school is important, you may have to make a choice between that and working. That choice is your choice. <br>  <br>  Best of luck and congratulations on the little one
1jwbQaZTaa	you would know by now if it was twins, especially at 20 weeks, looking at the ultrasound you would have seen them. my best friend was abnormally huge with her first, they say she had an extreme amount of amniotic fluid.<br>  <br>  p.s., dont tell your wife that shes "HUGE", pregnant women dont like that as much as men think. use the word glowing, that one is nice.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	again. It's not twins. they would have found a twin at this point. she just has a big belly!
qX3ixlNyaa	Yes, sperm can live 2-3 days. My doctor says to have intercourse every other day when you start to notice signs of ovulation. Female sperms live longer (2-3 days) where male sperms live much shorter. Hope this helps and good luck.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	72 hours after sex.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It depends on all the conditions and the strength of the sperm. There are too many factors to say for sure how long it will live. It can live up to 6 days if all conditions are right, but on average it live 2-3 days.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well when they say 5 days they mean that they can but only if fertile fluid is present (egg white mucus).  But yes 2-3 is the typical.  You can still get pregnant by having sex 3-4 days before but the chances are less than if you had sex closer to ovulation obviously.  When you have sex 3-4 days before the males usually die...they are quicker but not as strong...the females are slower but stronger and live longer.
LGynXkUTaa	When i first heard my babies heartbeat, it was 176.  Second time it went down to 174.  Last time, (My 20wk scan)  it was down to 155.<br>  <br>  Everyone was 100% sure i was having a girl cuz of the high heartbeat. But, it's a boy!<br>  <br>  My husband and i did all the old wives tales just to see how accurate they'd be.  Every single one said we we're having a girl.<br>  <br>  It was fun to guess around for 20 weeks and hear everyone's idea of what you're having.|`|1ntD4FQtaa	Well im 38weeks and my babys heartbeat is different all the time, so i dont think you can go off heartbeat for the sex of a baby. when mine was going high, the midwife said its just the baby moving about so it shows the burst on the monitor.(if that makes sense to you.)<br>  Good Luck && Congrats<br>  x|`|MlobKtcLaa	wow a girl! I was told anything that high was a girl|`|4Hn8LeD2aa	Yeah!  It's a girl!!|`|YliGP4mtaa	IT'S A GIRL!|`|n9UzkkFLaa	It's possible.<br>  Both my sons heartbeats were 140|`|AA11981363	with my 1st I went in for my 1st ultrasound and the heartbeat was 180, and it turned out it was a girl. With this baby the heartbeat was 156, so I don't know.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't take it as an accurate gender indicator, anything is possible. I guess the important thing is that heart is pumping blood like crazy YAY<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|i4zKc2bhaa	both of mine were high and girls, but that doesnt mean anything. My co-worker has had two girls and one was high and the other low. I think its somewhat of a indicator, but not 100% by any means.<br>  <br>  and wow....thats REALLY high
hieQHR0daa	I wouldn't worry too much about this. She will come round. When she starts reaching for food from your plate she will learn to cope with lumpier things because she will have to chew for herself. Pureed foods are easier for her. You say she is eating fruit and finger foods so she can chew and swallow appropriately.<br>  Just stick with it, she will get there.
Jf3DIPcNaa	I'm guessing you are talking about your boyfriend or husband? Your question was a little hard to read. <br>   <br>  Hormones in pregnancy are very out of control. They cause your body to change in drastic ways. They also affect your moods. One day you are fine and everything rolls off your back, the next day you are flipping out because of something stupid. <br>  <br>  You have very little control over this and there is pretty much nothing you can do to stop your feelings. You can try to stop yourself from saying or doing things that you will regret. One thing you can try is to just notice when you feel angry or frustrated and go into another room and try to cool off before you snap at someone. Take deep breaths. Think about your baby in your arms and how happy you will be and how whatever is happening really won't matter then. <br>  <br>  Also, it may help to just explain to him that you are hormonal and can't help it and you are really sorry when you get snappy or mean and that you don't mean it personally. If he knows that you can't control it, he will probably be more understanding and let it go. <br>  <br>  We all get moody and that's ok. Like I said, it's the hormones and it's not your fault your hormones are raging out of control. But you can try not to be mean to other people because of it. And yes, sometimes you will be nasty to someone, later just apologize and blame your hormones. Most people understand.|`|3a2111cbdbb21d29109b011360342334aa	i don't think you're pregnant . you're just tired not of him but of everything , You love him and he irritates you so you're in a two way road . you don't know what to do . <br>  i think you should sit and have a talk . not childish talk , adult to adult . you'd better tell him what you expect and listen to what he says . <br>  if it didn't work you'd better see a consultant .
4Uuehq2Faa	I dont agree with it because if the child comes out stillborn or with a life threatening situation the young child watching will get very distraught and upset, especially seeing their brother and sister stillborn :(|`|dHREHByPaa	I think that is a little crazy. I mean, I understand that is a natural part of life, but no way. Why would someone want to desensitize their children at such a young age? Why would a child want to see their mothers private parts? Wow, I totally agree with you.|`|hAuemuWTaa	No way not at all i say it's wrong if we don't tell them about sex coz we think they are young than y do we let them see something for grown ups, this will be nasty to watch for any infant. my god no.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	I think its a little young too. If i seen my mom go thru all that & see everything going on down there i wouldn't be right.. Lol<br>  Too graphic for them your know? <br>  <br>  <br>  I think if the child is older like 12++|`|Cah6nfV5aa	I think that's a little to young. I feel it would scare them and make them think you were being hurt. I think maybe the youngest I would allow is maybe 7 depending on the maturity of the child.|`|x6oAKWe6aa	It was scarring for me when I saw the video in sex. ed when I was twelve...|`|EmhBDHMtaa	i wouldn't i don't think that is right...it will probably scare the crap out of them.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	No. thats so nasty and seems so wrong. Im sure it would be scarring and im glad as hell I never saw my mother give birth.|`|ZXFg6D16aa	I still think thats to young of an age!! i agree with you!|`|7jXChfBNaa	gotta agree with ya. never in a million years...|`|VHHis05Naa	My daughter would be terrified, I think.  She's only three.  I think it depends on the child, really, but it wouldn't be a choice I'd make for my family.|`|giKCTfnfaa	my midwife asked if i wanted to let my son stay in the room when my youngest was born.  i must have given her the most god awful look when she asked because she said "i guess that's a no". i couldn't imagine letting my 5 yr old watch.  he'd be traumatized for life!!
tTRO1FA1aa	I have to say that out of my three births my waterbirth was my favorite. I actually labored in the jacuzzi tub during transition, which was a huge help. The water helped me float, allowing me to find comfortable positions with minimal effort. I could also control the temp..too hot just turn on the cold...too cold just pump up the hot. I really enjoyed the bubbles during labor but had it turned off when I started pushing, for obvious reasons! Lol<br>  <br>  The water also really helped me relax, was soothing, comforting, comfortable, and helped keep my vaginal skin elastic, which meant no tearing! I noticed a marked decrease in pain and or discomfort once I got in the tub and got settled!<br>  <br>  When it came time to push I had my hubby behind me, my feet on the edge of the tub, my midwife in front, and the baby on the way! I felt in control, happy, and even though it hurt, I really think that it quickened the entire process. This was my first and my active labor was just 5 hours, only 45 mins of pushing.<br>  <br>  Once she was born it was really neat to see her come out in the water. Of course she came out clean! Lol Well, at least not bloody. She was quite calm, but started crying within a few moments of having her umbilical cut(we waited till it stopped pulsing before we cut to give her all the oxygen she could still get from me).<br>  <br>  All in all I say that if you have the chance, go for it. Sometimes it may end up not being what you want or need, but even if you only get to labor in water, like I did with my third, now almost 5 months, its still a great experience and not to be lightly dismissed!<br>  <br>  Go for it, congratulations, and I hope all goes well for you!!|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i wonder the same..i seen it tons of times on "a baby story" looks good but u can't get any pain meds, ivy etc. i had my son 3 mths ago and i didnt get an epidural till after 8hrs of serious(painful)contractions...i was literally begging for that d@m epi! wit every contraction i thought "ok this one will kill me" i can imagine the water feeling good but not taking the edge off the contractions. the women i seen on tv having water births seemed relieved once they finally got into the water but still was feeling lots of pain  for hrs at a time so the doctors had them going in and out the water...|`|Coc593Ikaa	Check back with me in 2 months and I'll let you know!
RleHNAwWaa	I miscarried on March 21st 08 and fell pregnant about 6 weeks later I did a test on June 29th 08. I am now over due by one week. When I got the positive result I honestly thought that because I had miscarried that the hormone had not left my system so I was really shocked and it took ages to sink in. Sorry for your loss xxx|`|SiIuJXvwaa	when i had my miscarriage i got pregnant about 2 months later i did a test about 3 weeks after intercourse and i was pregnant. it depends on how far you are gone and how strong the pregnancy hormones are in your body but remember don't race in to having another baby just yet because your body mightn't be ready just yet so soon   good luck xx xx
bst23Cq2aa	There are three common rashes that can occur in young babies:<br>  <br>  Milia: This is a very common rash and is seen in most babies. It can start from one week to three weeks of age. The rash looks like tiny white or yellow spots on the baby’s face and neck. This is caused by secretions of the tiny glands in the skin of the baby after birth. Although parents can find it upsetting it does not cause the baby any discomfort and will disappear without treatment in four to six weeks<br>  <br>  Seborrheic Dermatitis: is also seen in babies from about one month of age. It can present as pumps on the skin that are smaller than Milia spots and has yellow crusty areas that are flaky and dry. It frequently occurs in the eyebrows and scalp and can also be seen on the neck and shoulders. It is best to consult your Doctor because it can be treated successfully with steroid creams available only on prescription.<br>  <br>  Infantile Eczema: is another common skin condition in young babies. It usually starts between one and five months of age. In eczema the skin has patches of raised areas that are red and occur in different areas of the body including the face. Some babies with severe eczema have allergies to milk while in others no specific cause can be found other than a tendency to dry skin. Some babies will grow out of eczema as they get older while in others it will be a problem throughout their childhood. The treatment of eczema includes moisturising creams and bath oils. Severe eczema is often treated with steroid creams and other ointments prescribed by your doctor.<br>  <br>  It is always advisable to have a baby’s rash checked by your health visitor or Doctor so that the correct advice treatment can be given<br>  <br>  have a look at this website which might help<br>  <a href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/help/bodykey/Questions/Index.aspx?nodes=fddLsBIQBHc%3D" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/help/bodykey...</a><br>  <br>  if you are concerned you should take her to get checked out. there is no such thing as being overprotective, i know i would take my children if i was worried and concerned.|`|d1csiCLKaa	You are doing the right thing by taking her to the Docs.<br>  <br>  My daughter recently had a red/pink rash behind her ears on her neck and on her tummy, hers turned out to be a bad heat rash as she gets very hot at night, no matter if its cold outside.<br>  <br>  Im sure she will be fine, if she is ok in herself then don't be to alarmed.|`|hmX4ko0Eaa	If she's getting over a virus it could be a viral rash. It's the body's final way of flushing out the system. Good to take her to the GP and get it checked out.|`|IjkPBYlkaa	it might be allergic to something your feeding her|`|CwXe7OgIaa	My bub has conjunctivitis at the moment and a rash on face and neck, totally normal doc told me.

S5Lsbh0taa	Black it's self isn't a colour. 'Pitch' is a descriptive term for a 'shade' of black- but true black has no reflection of light what so ever. It absorbs all light therefore 'pitch' black.<br>  <br>  (Maroon doesn't even come into it really, its a colour, very dark shade in the reds.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever noticed that when your wearing very dark colours you feel warmer Even very hot than when you wear whites? That shows the opposites in the two 'colours'  and how they work when it comes to reflective light. <br>  <br>  All the best with your assignment|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Technically, Serenity is correct. Black is the non-reflection (absorption) of the color spectrum. Black is generally considered a "shade" rather than a color by people who care about these things. <br>  <br>  "Black can be defined as the visual impression experienced when no visible light reaches the eye. (This makes a contrast with whiteness, the impression of any combination of colors of light that equally stimulates all three types of color-sensitive visual receptors.)<br>  <br>  Pigments that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye "look black". A black pigment can, however, result from a combination of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called "black".<br>  <br>  This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the lack of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment.' -wiki<br>  <br>  I would go with Maroon - but I'm an artist (ie - one of the people who "care" about these things. LOl!)<br>  <br>  My Dad was a mathematician (he even wrote textbooks) and he would have been appalled to hear trig described as a swear word. However BAD can refer to an angle in sines, so maybe your teacher is making a bad pun.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	Trigonometry is another form of math.  very advanced math.  And what does it matter if it's a swear word?  You got freedom of speech, use it!<br>  <br>  And pitch black is the darkest.... how is this a math question?  Whatever... and maroon is red...|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I would also go with maroon. Black is not a color but the absence of all color.|`|HvTLwNNSaa	well, i think pitch black, because it sounds the darkest|`|3lFDvyY9aa	Pitch Black|`|P5wOmSVoaa	the darkest colour that actually existed was WHITE.

Z1e3Cxjoaa	At this point you could go either way.  The pill is suppose to regulate you and maybe this particular pill isn't right for you.  You might want to try a different one.  Take another test in about a week and see what it says.|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	wait 2 weeks to test.  Ur probably not pregnant
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Take a pregnancy test, an early detection on because they detect the lowest hcg count. If you were it may still test a positive or a faint line of some kind other than that there's no way to tell. It could have been just clots though, I've had the same thing happen and I'm sure it was just coagulated, so to speak, thick clumped blood.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	We can't tell you. You need to visit a doctor and get checked out...|`|rh9CRcXraa	I would definately go to the doctor.|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	I use to have that happen all the time before I was sexually active so I know I couldn't have been having a miscarriage. But you still might want to go to the Dr. and get checked out just to make sure everything's fine.
kaqPSgTVaa	Not if you have a regular 28 day cylce. It's far too early. If you have a 24 or 25 day cycle then it's possible, but still pretty unlikely.  You'll most likely not get an accurate result until day 27 or 28 if you have a 28 day cycle or day 24 or 25 if you have a 25 day cycle.|`|yp9rEMSraa	You are going to take it too early and get that BFN....You should wait...baby dust|`|SwJIeyCJaa	Ido not think it would show the correct result so you'd better wait for 10 days.You might be pregnant and might stress you if you think you aren't.<br>  Good luck!!!|`|qoyokiSiaa	Well, I will say one thing a blood test will show up if your prego or not. It takes less time then urine WAY less
qzY6TuQmaa	i had that it got worse it ended up b-ing a infection
Vad64Jjoaa	Because people go about things the wrong way. Instead of understanding that we are all mothers raising our kids the best way we know how and trying to help out (you know the whole it takes a village thing) they criticize to get their point across. BFeeding is best, but if you don't then so what? As long as the baby is happy and fed then what else matter's. I love this section and come on here often to find advice for problems I might have and solutions to the problems. I am glad we live in a time that we can just click a mouse and find many answers and simple solutions to what ever is going on. I would love for the feud to be gone ; ) I love you all and thank you.|`|ybexjS2Paa	I know what you mean, for me it's a personal choice and the most aggressive people don't even have kids of their own. I breastfed my son for 8 weeks and stopped because I didn't have any more milk coming. I tried everything and we both were so stressed out that my doctor and midwife said to change it to the formula. With my daughter I breastfed her for 4 months until we both got bad pneumonia and ended up in hospital for a week. She didn't want to eat and my milk was getting weaker every day until it stopped coming. I'd love to feed them both longer but under the circumstances I couldn't. I don't get why people have problem with other people choices. What's their problem?|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Frankly put, it's because some mothers view their way of parenting as the ONLY way, any way other than theirs is inferior in their eyes.<br>  <br>  I am recovering now from a stint of breast cancer, and even stating on this site I would be receiving a double mastectomy, some people oyt there STILL gave me a hard time.<br>  <br>  Point is, I have a very healthy son ( and no more breasts :() , so while some people think formula feeding is 'selfish', I'd like to hear news from the person who can breastfeed, with no breasts! <br>  <br>  People are always going to debate this, it's a pity it has to be an issue at all.|`|yIdgG8b1aa	Well on here you get some right idiots going into 1 because they can basically, they don't know the person & seem to think it's ok to be rude & horrible because it's a website & not face to face, i was told i should die because i don't breastfeed... lovely women in person i'm sure lol. <br>  As for the breast vs bottle thing, well i am bottle feeding & i can tell you i honestly wish i had breastfed. I am having problems with bottle feeding like wind & needing to switch her formula ETC. Its alot of hassle if it don't work and trying new different things, with breast it's mothers milk that we all know is best so i don't need to explain the pro's of breastfeeding but for me i had a rough pregnancy & just wanted my hormones to settle down & go back to normal, if i was breastfeeding i would have been the mad woman from hell for another ex amount of months lol. I know it sounds like nothing but i honestly thought i would suffer from PPD when i was pregnant as my hormones were such a mess & i think we are all scared of getting that so you can see why i just wanted to get back to normal. But i do feel terrible for not breastfeeding & with my next baby i will def atleast try to do it, we all learn by our mistakes hey : )|`|UseJjREjaa	I don't really know.  I've had ppl attack me for bottle feeding all 3 of my boys.  But with my oldest son I NEVER produced any milk even after I had him.  Plus my husband was very interested in feedings (in fact he did most of it)<br>  <br>  Then I had twin boys.  Well I don't know how many mothers out there with twins that were able to breastfeed.  It just seems very hard to me.  Any other way I didn't produce breast milk til after they were a week old.  So I went on ahead and kept bottle feeding.  It is alot easier with twins.  Because I did try  but they were simply too big for it.  They wake up at the same time to eat and it was too hard to hold them both to feed, etc.|`|fBGIUSfaaa	usually the people with the problem probably dont have kids... everyone is knows the 'perfect' way to raise children till they have their own! If a mother cannot breastfeed for any reason bottle feeding is fine, breastfeeding is natural and healthier for bub but in reality its not always easy, stress, fail to attach properly, lifestyle complications-mother going back to work... as long as the baby is healthy and fed and growing well and is loved it shouldnt matter. As mothers we do our best and thats all we can do.|`|leAePwHVaa	because lot of moms thinks they are better person and mother when they are breast feeding...they think that its their ultimate achievement...duhhh!!!! i dont mind, i breastfed my baby for 10 weeks until i lost supply...my baby had a very hard time latching, she's always having gas pain because she cannot latch properly...i switched her to formula and she's ok...she's also never been sick...<br>  the thing is as long as your feeding your baby, i dont care...<br>  and there are lot of self centered people here...wheww<br>  <br>  and it really made no sense to me the thing that if you love your baby, you will breastfeed...how can people say that...how about those people who cant because of various reasons...does it mean that they dont love their baby or theyre selfish?|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I wont put anyone down for their choice, but I do advocate nursing because there is a noticeable difference between my babies and bottle fed babies. My son never had a sick visit in the doctor until he was 1 after I stopped nursing. :)|`|5f6XnInEaa	I know, it's bothering, isn't it.<br>  <br>  I really don't care what someone else feeds there kid, as long as they are feeding it!
CtENASfvaa	well parents are not stupid ESPECIALLY mothers...most likely she already knows that something is going on...just tell her sometimes when you make a big deal out of nothing you'll be surprised at how she reacts (ex:when i told my dad i was pregnant he just said "ok" and i was waiting for him to go crazy) parents are aware of when is going on nowadays and hey some of them did way worse things when they were your age just stay calm and talk to your mom like a grown up it might even help if your boyfriend is there with you to show that you guys are serious and that he is there to support you but please please please make sure you get on birth control if your not already being a mommy is not easy especially at 16 and you never know relationships dont always last forever...good luck though wish you the best of luck with your relationship as well|`|8rTHANk5aa	tell her everything u just typed. that should explain everything.<br>  if she yells back. you have to keep calm and prove to her that your an adult now and can make your own choices..if she flips out that you start reasoning, but KEEP CALM...|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	He committed Statutory Rape!!!!  It doesn't matter, whether, or not, you consented.  You are not the 'Age of Consent'.  He is considered an adult by law.  You are still a minor.|`|XN0sRoqpaa	tell your mum.<br>  <br>  NOT US,.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Ok......my opinion is he is too old for you and your mom will think the same....I mean I'm 18 and wouldn't date someone of your age, see what I mean. Also if you live in the states then lawfully he shouldn't have had sex with you whether you consented or not. If you live in the UK then he also shouldn't have had sex with you because you are underage at 15, doesn't matter that you are 16 next month, when you had sex you were and still are 15. So yeah, just tell your mom. There is no particular way to do it...you just sort of do it. I mean it can't be that difficult if you think you are ready to have sex then it should be like really easy to tell your mom that you are dating someone.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	You'll be 16, age of consent. <br>  She can't really say anything, honestly ..
iNE2nl5taa	Welllllll, first off you will need to make sure the baby is yours. even though you already know or think you know there has to be paternity test to prove.<br>  Thennnnn, take her to court get rights to the child see it everything weekend or other weekend.<br>  And sad on your part but you will have to pay support for the next 18 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  Word of advice: try and work things out with the mother of your child this day in age children need their parents and if it doesn't work out alteast be friends for the kid. Setting a good example for the child.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|ivH8tRtsaa	You have the right to make payments for the next 18 years! LOL<br>  Seriously though, you do have legal rights. You need to get the kid legitimized. A lawyer can help you with that. After that, you have the same rights as the mother until a judge says otherwise. As long as your life is somewhat straight and legal, you can get court ordered visitation and maybe custody if you can prove yourself more fit than the mother to raise the child. She can't stop you from being the father. Get the law on your side. Talk to an attorney. By the way, I am not a lawyer and this is not an advertisement. I am a father of five by four different women. Believe me, I know what I am talking about. Good luck and don't let the mother take the anger she has for you (what did you do?) out on the kid. The kid needs a father. She is being very immature. Let the courts handle this for you. Anything you do otherwise will be held against you.|`|vCtCW8ODaa	as you were not married she doesn't have to name you as the father on the birth certificate, in fact she can only name you if you go as a couple and register the baby, as this seems unlikely you could go to court and request a paternity test, if that happens then the court could grant you some visitation rights and as previously mentioned the right to support the child for the next 18 years|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	ask a lawyer<br>  but off hand, you can insist on a blood test to establish paternity, which will give you the right to be a father and 18 years worth of child support|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	lawyer up. ask for a dna test just to b positive u should have the rights to c him/her. next time condom it up|`|NJqH1PCNaa	u can sue for custody to see the kids at least a month|`|WchGezIAaa	your rights are pretty much nothing compared to the mother sadly.<br>  Its unfair huh?<br>  Thats part of the Abortion Debate going around.<br>  <br>  Anywho<br>  Good luck working it out.

YlveXYHUaa	that's so sweet that she loves you so much...<br>  <br>  just give her some time. she'll get used to you and then the clinginess will probably decrease. this is one of those times you should probably sacrifice for the sake of someone else. if she's technically your sister now, this is the time to make it count. you're making her life shine, why do anything to disrupt something so great?|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Usually families take a while to adjust to adoptions, especially in cases like yours, where the adoptee is older and suffered some abuse in the past.  She has probably lost people she cared about before and is afraid of losing you and your mother too.  If your mother adopted her through an agency, they might know family counselors who can help with her attachment issues.|`|x1qKGmzSaa	just tell her. she may get upset, but eventually she'll get over it. dont be mean or anything, just tell her you will in a little bit or something<br>  <br>  :)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Maybe she is afraid. I dont know her past but maybe shes afraid to leave you because you will leave her life. Just talk with her and tell her how you feel. Dont forget where she came from and what a good life you have had compared to hers.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Clearly she thinks right now that you hung the moon and you should savor that. I understand what you are saying, though. You are just a kid yourself and you need some time with your friends, of course. A good idea might be to work out times here and there where your mom has time with your new sister alone and you have time alone. Then both you and your mom also have time where you know she is cared for and you have time to yourself.
7CFoUX07aa	Advantages- call/text your friends, family, relatives for socializing and emergencies and other people plus it makes you look cool <br>  <br>  Disadvantages-bills, if you got caught texting in class phone be taken away parents notified get you grounded|`|oGHtaaCkaa	K, first of all teenager is one word. <br>  <br>  Advantages: emergencies, talking with friends etc.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages: I'm guessing the bill and getting distracted too easily.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Advantage: Getting a hold of someone, in an emergency<br>  <br>  Disadvantage: Brain cancer from extended use.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I don't see any disadvantages. <br>  <br>  You can control how many minutes they use. Say they use up all their minutes you can put a block that will disable the phone from going over. <br>  The same with texting. <br>  <br>  You can control what numbers they call and what numbers call them. <br>  You can set it up through the wireless company. <br>  You can set a list of their friends numbers in which they are allowed to call. <br>  <br>  You can disable picture messaging if you are worried about them sending nude pictures. <br>  <br>  If you have verizon its only $10 dollars a month for unlimited texting. <br>  <br>  Teens can use it to keep in touch with your peers. No cell phone equals social disability. <br>  Parents can use it to call their teens when they are out and away from the home.<br>  Pay phones are rare so cell phones are good in case of an emergency. <br>  You can add a line to your plan for only $10. <br>  And some of the phones are free.<br>  <br>  So you do really have a lot of control over the phones and it really can be inexpensive.|`|AA10397522	teens should have a phone by the time they hit high school, at the latest.  Theyre going to doing extracurriculars, sports, etc. and they need a way to communicate with you and their peers.  I got one when I was in 7th grade and my parents never regretted it.|`|8rTHANk5aa	provides protection when needed<br>  always has something to contact people with<br>  <br>  one heck of a phone bill
dHREHByPaa	I would definitely get s second opinion. That doesn't even sound right. Did they test him for epilepsy? I mean people don't just have seizures without something being linked to it. Take your son to a different doctor. Go out of town if you have to. Good luck and I will pray for him.|`|kWXik6phaa	it sounds like either epilepsy or neonatal myoclonus. i would call the doctor back and demand an earlier appointment. i ahd to do that with my son and it took us almost 3 years to convince the dr. he was seizing. he had a normal eeg and a normal CT scan and MRI scan. it wasnt unitl he started turning blue and having problems iwth behaviour that they officially diagnosed him with epilepsy and he has firing in the occipital lobe. i would do whats right for your child and switch doctors.good luck to you|`|ob9oJpKbaa	My friends daughter used to have a similar thing happen to her when her temperature got too high. They were called Fibril Convulsions. It was something she grew out of, and by the time she was 3 or 4 she no longer had them. It can be a very scary experience- we used to spend hours keeping her cool with wet towels etc.<br>  <br>  I would definitely demand more answers from your doctor, and if you he/she wont help you go to another. They should also be giving advice on what to do when these seizures happen. Don't stop until you are satisfied with an answer, and your mind is at ease about it. Good luck.|`|vEBfp8yHaa	This is serious!!!  What kind of retard is your doctor!!!!???  Your baby could have brain damage if these continue!!!!!!!  Every seizure kills a part of their brain - if you don't want to end up w/ a vegetable baby better get yourself to a better doctor!  NOW!!!!|`|UtNtSv8Iaa	if they're getting worse then i would bring him in immediately. something isn't right. bring him to a different doctor. that sounds really scary. make sure they do something about it. good luck|`|V3ZyGJMtaa	Find a different doctor in a different practice. If you have a childrens hospital near you at all i would take him in right away...|`|wUVUXHZtaa	Remember, the doctor works for you!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can always go to a different doctor and get a second opinion.|`|MwcNwpIvaa	Find another doctor. Having seizures as any age is not normal or okay. The fact that your doctor is not concerned about a premature infant having seizures worries me!|`|WoxMH0wZaa	The next time he has a seizure, take him to the ER. and get a referal to a neurologist. the neuro will read the eeg and perhaps do other tests like an MRI. If your baby is continually having seizures, there is most likely an underlying cause like epilepsy...which can be controlled with medication. My sister who is 3 years old has epilepsy, and when she had her first seizure, my parents took her to the ER and they basically just sent us home and said to come back if she had another. and when she had another, they refered us to a neuro and said to quit going to the ER. After trying several medications, she's now been seizure free about 2 months. Go with your best instinct....if you don't think your baby is fine...then push for treatment. better safe than sorry.|`|B7nqTcttaa	I would be going some where that you will get an actual helpful opinion. What kind of mother can just turn a blind eye to seizures? You are definitely right to worry. I know i would if it was my child. Even if it is something he may grow out of there must be something you can do in the mean time to fix it a little. Just look around for a better doc. Sorry I don't have better advice and good luck, I hope all turns out well :)|`|dwvVg4A3aa	obviously seizures are not "normal" or "nothing", babies just don't have seizures for the sport of it. You need to talk to your private pediatrician, and /or get a second opinion and a referral to a pediatric neurologist.|`|wYiaokysaa	You should definitely get a second oppion, I have had a lot of quack doctors.

Also, it's not a very good reason to name them that just because you like some book series so much. These Twilight fans are taking things way too far...|`|kpJN1W3Vaa	Girl, you been doin' too much weed. Cullen ... eh, not a bad name.

RMB9JUfuaa	I understand your frustration, I have a 19 month old girl as well who is going through the same "terrible two" stage right now. Tempers, constantly grabbing things they aren't supposed to be touching, etc. Just remember to take a step back and remember even after all of that, she is still just a baby who is very curious, she is testing her limits and needs to know bounderies. The best thing to do at this time is to sit down and discuss disciplinary actions, such as time outs. (Remember that not one discipline works for every child, you will both have to work together as parents to find one that fits and works for the lil girl). If you do use, let's say time outs, stick to it and when you have already gave the lil one a warning not to touch something, and she does it again anyways, put her in her designated spot right that second. Also, look up super nanny online for some tips geared toward her age group for discipline. But most of all, as tiring and stressful as it may be, don't let her get to you. Trust me, this will pass soon enough! :-) try to keep her occupied as best as you can too. Maybe just getting stickers and having her stick them to a paper, that's one activity that allows me to have a sit down break with my daughter, she enjoys it, and its great for her fine motor skills, lol. If you need any other help or support, feel free to email me. We are all learning parents trying to do what's best. And atleast you came forward with your frustration rather than hide it. Good luck!|`|AA10943329	I am thinking you are a troll and trying to get a rise out of people. <br>  If not then you need to grow up. she is a baby thats what they do.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Wait...who's the 19 month old here?<br>  <br>  Her daughter is acting like a 19 month old. Sounds perfectly normal. Maybe you're just not cut out for the job as her boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Joshilan: Not every child is like your son. His girlfriend's daughter is definitely not abnormal. Good for you, having a potty trained 20 month old, but not all children are alike.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Talk to her and tell her how you feel.|`|AA11383122	number one potty training isn't impossible. But that kid is too young to be potty trained my baby's doctor didn't want me to potty train till my little one was 2.<br>  Also the kid doesn't seem that bad you sound like the jerk. Remember if you don't like your girlfriends kid break up with her cause i'm more then sure her kid comes BEFORE you.<br>  Also i'm sure she didn't think oh i'm going to hit that AS*HOL*. I'm sure she just threw her sippy cup.<br>  I wish my kid would eat a lot. That is a GOOD THING. I'm lucky if i can get two meals in a day with my kid.<br>  What is wrong about the child drinking from a sippy cup all day???????????????????? Nothing the child should be able to get liquid when it's thirsty.<br>  Kids want everything they can't have also WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING WITH A INFANT REAL MATURE... If she wants something she can't have change the subject give her a favorite toy instead.<br>  <br>  You sound too imature to be thinking about caring for a child grow up first.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Yea she sounds like a little turkey he-he she seems like she needs guidelines and needs to be told NO. You just need to talk to your girlfriend and tell her look the 19 month old needs some discipline she isn't too young to be told no or taken away from a situation. She doesn't need a sippy at night bc that is just a bad habit and plus not good for the teeth. And she isn't too young to be potty broke you just have to take the time out to do it. Good luck and talk to your gf if the 19 month old is like that now whew good luck in the future|`|1U7yLEf9aa	All babies are different. She will start calming down when she gets older. You just sound annoyed. It's fine for her to want a bottle or sippy cup at night and to do all of those things. She doesn't know any better. You shouldn't have got with someone that already has a child. Saying those things ^^^^^ to her probably wont help. Any mother will chose her baby over a man. Just remember that she is just a baby... her brain is so tiny and she doesn't know any better.|`|nQQs4HFgaa	Wow seems like you have your hands full. Be honest with her if she is worth it she will listen to you maybe she is feeling overwhelmed about it too and doesn't know what to do. It's not to late to fix this with some work her child can become a great and happy child.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|r4E2zXL8aa	It's a toddler, what do you expect? I don't think you're cut out for the role of a parent. Get out of the relationship, for the child's sake. How is a 19 month old toddler out of control? Please... Get a life! And don't forget to grow up!|`|TVx4iWlGaa	That sounds like all 19 month old children. Btw shes a little young for potty training.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	answer honestly. tell her whats going on. tell her what your afraid of. thats all you can do in this situation. <br>  go crazy in your life or let your life drive you crazy!|`|NOjcTeT4aa	She isn't your child ? Well if you are gonna be in this girls life as her father then you and her mother need to sit down and discuss your "rights", like can you spank or punish, does she want to discipline her child herself. Does this girl call you daddy ? Because if so then you should have the right to act as her daddy.<br>  <br>   Just out of curiosity, i don't mean to be rude, but you have a infant with this woman, but she has a 19 mo with someone else, why did you get into a relationship with someone with an infant ? What kind of woman is your girlfriend that she rushed into another relationship and became pregnant again so soon, with another man.|`|UseJjREjaa	For the ppl saying that she sounds like a normal 19 month old that is crazy.  My son is 20 months old and he does nothing like that.  He goes to bed at 8 sleeps straight til noon.  He doesn't hit or throw things.  He kisses his little brothers (twins) not throws stuff at him.  And no it is NOT too early for potty training.  My son is already almost completely potty trained and I only started with him 2 weeks ago!<br>  <br>  An answer for you is to just just tell gf how you feel.  If she truly loved you she would realize that it could tear you apart.  Children (esp from a diff relationship) can be a mood breaker for anything.  You need to set up some ground rules with this little girl.  I'm sure she is a sweet little princess once you explain to her what is right and wrong.  <br>  <br>  My little boy if he is doing something bad I'll walk up to him and tell him no.  IF he continues he gets a slap on the hand.  When he starts crying I get down to eye level with him give him and hug, look him in the eye, and expain why that happened to him.  He ends up fine within seconds later and usually won't do it again until at least the next day.  Children must be taught over and over again until they get it right because their brains cannot process so much yet.|`|V3ZyGJMtaa	A child is just that a child they do what you teach them is right. I have a 2 year old that would not dream of acting that way. The only thing you can do at this point and talk to your girl about what is going on and the way these kids are being brought up.. A child will act out at any age and they will have day where it seems like all they want that day is to drive you crazy. However that should not be they live everyday, There has to be limit with everything. What you teach them today will effect your tomorrow. You need to thing about your baby as well how is he/she going to be acting in a years time. You need to make a change if not for you but for your baby. Talk to your girl. As a mother dont attack her sit down and find a way to tell she look this is this with out tell her you child is a demond because if she feels you are attacking her or her baby you are SOL. Good luck
giKCTfnfaa	get her a nice card with an iou for a night out with the girls  to celebrate her 21st birthday after the baby is born.  you could also get her a gift certificate to get a mani/pedi or to a nice spa for a day of relaxation!|`|dwvVg4A3aa	Although you said you didn't want it to be baby related, like the other lady said, she's not expecting anything for herself if the shower"s on her birthday. Trust me, I know, my shower was on my birthday. If she's a first time mom she's probably really excited about the baby and won't mind pregnancy/ baby related stuff. Like books, etc..., in fact it's probably what she's expecting, if anything!|`|tZ1XPd1paa	Aww! Ill be 38 weeks pregnant when I turn 21 lol. <br>  <br>  Honestly, your friend probably isn't expecting anything for herself since she's having the shower oh her bday. So, it really depends on what she likes to do. Anything from a gift card to a book to a cd. Something simple!|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I suggest a gift voucher for something relaxing. If she is wanting to have some drinks once her child is born, get her some wineglasses and engrave them with her name and happy 21st. I love that.|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	jewelery maybe? (you can get cheap ones at wal-mart)|`|cFSpYoDfaa	nice pair of shoes|`|FyAHNpQbaa	make her a coupon book for after the baby is born. put in things like "redeemable for one night of babysitting so you can have some me time", "redeemable for one day of helping around the house", or "redeemable for one girl's night out"<br>  trust me, she will appreciate it.|`|v0QWwmwGaa	I just had a b day on sunday and i really wasn't thinking about myself... im having my baby shower on sunday... well i wanted to have done it on my b day but my family didn't want me to.... so im sure shes not really thinking about herself at the moment... but im sure she will like anything u do get her...|`|TLbzXMhhaa	I think a nice bath set would be great. With a nice bubble bath, lotions, candle etc..This will make her relax and make her feel nice as well. Maybe a pair of comfy slippers to go along? Make it like a spa gift. They would have a great gift set a Bath and Body works, or even if there is a Marshalls or TjMaxx around you. They have great gifts like that for really cheap! Good Luck!|`|qk4k709Aaa	Im not sure what kind of things, your friend is into, but for my friends birthdays, I always make them a scrapbook with all our memories and fun stuff we've done.. its cheap, and comes from the heart, those gifts always mean more.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Not a mucus plug, just discharge which is normal to have more of when you are pregnant. I lost 20 lbs in my first trimester and spent the second trimester gaining it back then gained another 20 in my last trimester, don't worry about it. Baby's are parasites (by definition they are) and will take what it needs from you, so your baby is fine. Try not to worry and eat when and what you can. By the way if your doctor dismisses you again whatever your concern no matter how silly get another one, you need someone who will listen to you and address your concerns. Finding a midwife is always a possibility and they are so much more personable.|`|VHHis05Naa	It sounds like you might have Hyperemesis Gravidarum.  There are medications you can take for some relief.  Ask your provider about these.  Not being able to keep fluids down will lead to dehydration, which will make you feel ten times worse.  Please get help!   I don't know about the mucous plug thing, but it could just be heavy discharge (very common in pregnancy).|`|UTb5chyJaa	hey sweetie, i can atleast help you with the nausea, ask your dr. for phenergan. its what i take im 7 mons preg and expecislly the 1st 4 months i had horrible morning sickness, it was all day, all night, i couldnt even keep down water, but the phenegan HELPS i would swear by it. this is my 3rd pregnancy and i always loose ateast 20-30lbs thee first 4 or 5 mons, but then it gets better and i start to gain weight. in 7 months,after loosing almost 30lbs, i have gained 7lbs. the medical term for that kid of morning sickness is Hyperemesis gravidarum- that is what i have, ask your doc about it. but as far as the mucus goes, i loose stuff like that all the time- ur mucus plug is really large, u cnt miss it, but ask the new do if u r worried. try not to stress, thats not good for baby and take ur prenatals they r very important when ur sick like that. GOOD LUCK AND BEST WISHES!|`|bbe253b8bd16b56edbb017e1a281d44eaa	Being nauseous can be hard during pregnancy. Some women get it much worse than others. If so you will lose weight at a rapid pace and it might become necessary for your doctor to prescribe something for your nausea.As for your mucous plug...you won't lose that till much later in pregnancy.Sounds like the you might of just been having thick cervical discharge or even an infection of some sort.If your losing your breath and having cramps that hard go to the ER immediately!Signs of premature labor are cramps(can be in the belly or stomach),bleeding,thick bloody show,and a feeling of change in your cervix.Visit the er if you keep having issues...better to be safe than sorry~
PtqN5WM3aa	I've had 5 kids, and every single one of them walked/talked/etc. at different ages. Why pediatricians tell mothers this crap is beyond me. It's like a race that all kids of "this age" should be doing "that". Your child is a child, not a robot.  She will develop skills in her own good time, not when an "expert" says she should.<br>  <br>  It's great to try to help your child with reading and talking, but don't make it about that. You're supposed to be enjoying this baby, not waiting for her to do something to a timetable. Let her be a child. Relax and enjoy this time. It doesn't last forever, and the time you spend worrying about this is wasting this precious stage.<br>  <br>  Listen to your own instincts and have fun with your little one. xxx|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If she just turned 1 only saying mama and dada is normal....|`|gyzMxjAiaa	You don't have to do anything but talk to her . It is common for development to leap ahead in one are while the others have to wait a while. It will all even out in the end.|`|on5NQxhkaa	You know, I am no doctor but I don't believe that there is any kind of relationship between the development of motor and verbal skills... I did take a child development class last semester. I think it varies for each child.. there is obviously a "norm" which a child will typically be close to, but I don't think a fast development in one area = a slow development in another... some children learn quickly, some slowly, some at different speed in different areas... I don't think there is much of a pattern to that.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I dont know my son said mama at 6 months and by 9 months he was saying hi, bye bye, and a few other words. He crawled at 6 1/2 months and was walking by the time he was a 1 yr old. so i dont know how true that is i have never heard that before. He has always dont things early way before he should have, but he was just busy busy busy too.|`|yZDyUfSNaa	I'm probably going to echo a lot of your other responses...every child is different. Sure, maybe there is a correlation between a child who focuses and advances early on motor skills being a bit behind in verbal skills, and vice versa. But who knows exactly, they are children and don't care what some chart says. <br>  <br>  My son hit most of his motor developments before or on target with the charts as a baby. His language, too, but maybe a tad slower than the "average baby." By one, he said three words, mama, dada and tickle. Which, by the way, is totally normal and not "behind," so I'm not sure why your doc led you to believe your daughter is developing slowly in that area. As for my son, he slowly picked up words until he hit somewhere between 16 and 18 months when his language exploded. Seriously, he went from a handful of words to speaking in entire paragraphs. Yesterday, we went for an assessment at his future preschool so they could determine which class would best suit him, he's 2.8 right now, and they were amazed at how well he talks and how many words he has (well over 800 by now -- I stopped counting awhile back). They gushed and gushed. Proud Mama moment for sure, but I must say it's all him and just what he's into. And, here I was worried when he was one and only said three things. lol.<br>  <br>  As for motor development, he's always hit them by the time the charts say but that is definitely not his focus. Heck, while he's been able to clap since he was a baby, he just now is getting into it and excited about it. So, is my 11-month-old daughter, who is much more into her motor skills than my son ever was. It's very funny to watch actually.<br>  <br>  Anyway, my point is that every kid is different, and sure, if a kid focuses on one thing or another, sure, maybe other areas will come a little slower. But, the range of normal is HUGE and every child really is different. Your daughter sounds perfectly normal in the language arena and advanced in the motor skills department. Her language will come, just keep doing what you're doing.|`|FetBJb3Laa	My hubby who is a doc himself says that the mother is a best pediatrician...... and i firmly believe that. My daughter who will soon be turning 3 was also very late in her verbal skills... and lots of people used to comment but we have to remember that each child is an individual in herself and will develop skills differently..... moreover there r five sets of skills a child develops--- language, social , motor, cognitive and gross motor......if a child has prob with any 3 or more than 3 sets only then there is reason to worry.... good luck and enjoy the baby and its babbling too!!!!!!

c105398fe806f764ecd6ed4f3d1dd45baa	One thing I learned very quickly is that you CAN have a runny nose during pregnancy, also stuffy, and nosebleeds to boot!  It does sound like you're pregnant, but like everyone said, it may be that you are testing too early to get a positive from an at home pregnancy test.  I hope your blood work provides you some answers!  <br>  Something I read, and I just read this so don't bank on it, but that women who are trying to get pregnant can experience the symptoms, or confuse other symptoms for pregnancy.  I guess there were a couple of times in the three or four years we tried that I was dead convinced.  However, that does seem like a lot of symptoms to be confused about.  :)  I really hope that you get the answer that you are looking for!|`|qoyokiSiaa	Well.... it kindof sounds like you are prego and just because the hpt's were negative doesn't mean your blood one will also. Due to the fact it takes longer for a positive with urine than with the blood. I think that if your body hasnt taken it regular route then I believe you are with child. Good Luck|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	You have the same reaction to a cig that you had when you were pregnant with your 1st child, and you keep feeling hungry & nauseous.  I'd love to say you are pregnant, but you could also have the flu.  Runny noses don't usually happen when you're pregnant.  Then again, being pregnant does temporarily make your immune system weaker.  Try taking another pg test.  Sometimes the Hcg hormone isn't strong enough.  As each day passes, it'll get stronger until about 8-9 weeks of pregnancy, and then drop off from there.  Good Luck & possibly congratulations!|`|jCGyJn5Oaa	Wow i am going through the exact same thing. Usually my breasts start to hurt a few days before my period however this month they started hurting over 2 weeks early. I took a hpt a week ago and it was a BFN. I have had 2 blood test from the doc this past week, and its a BFN, however I feel pregnant and wasnt planning so I know that this is not in my head. My lower belly above my pubic bone is swollen and hard as well. Also the sides of my lower belly feel rather tight. I had the gyno test me for ovarian cyst and he said i didnt have any. Tonight I threw up and when I press on my belly it feels weird and makes me wanna puke more. <br>  <br>  I started bleeding on the 2nd however my period was not at all normal. It was very light pink slimy! and overly bright red and very little. Usually i spot brown for a few hours or a day and then the next i get a medium period for about 3 days changing my pad about 4-5 times a day and then it tapers off gone by the 4th day. This time i spotted pink when using the toilet. I went into the gyno and demanded an examantion and he claimed my period was there cause he saw a lot of blood. he gave me a maxi pad and sent me home...when i got home there was nothing on it. Go figure and i have not bleed or spotted since. So basically i had 2 days of spotting and less than a tablespoon of blood in total. Had a few huge clots and a few small ones. Never ever in my life has this been normal. <br>  <br>  I did another HPT and still it says NEGATIVE.<br>  <br>  Not sure when my period is due because it has been rather irregualr in a way for the past 4 months from a previous ovarian cyst and surgery...it comes between the 25th and 3rd.<br>  <br>  My breast did stop hurting about 2 days after i spotted when the spotting stopped. usually on a normal period it stops hurting the day i bleed.<br>  <br>  Any help would be appreciated and advice as i have had numerous m/c and have not had any children. I am almost 30.<br>  <br>  Also I have had some cramping on my cervix. I reconize that cramp during previous miscarriages or pregancy before i miscarry. It isnt bad though. I have felt it about 3 times and very small pain.<br>  <br>  i usually am hurlded over in menstrual cramps...this time when i had the suspected period it was a differnt kind of cramp. More like an achiness and very bad back pain.|`|fKhjdqCGaa	It does really sound like you are pregnant. It could possibly be too early for you to test with a hpt. Blood tests are way more accurate, so even if you didn't get a positive hpt you could get a positive blood test, so don't give up yet. Best wishes;)|`|yp9rEMSraa	You might be prego but dont have enough hormones in your system yet....When did you take your blood test?  You might have taken that too early...I would wait till about a week or a few days past 45 days....i have an irregular period and i know how hard it can be to gage when exactly you are suppose to start and not start...you have the signs on being prego but some of those signs are signs that you are going to start your period also....I hope that you are but i think for a truly accurate reading because you are so irregular you might need to wait longer....<br>  Best of luck and lots of baby dust to you

I'm sure they aren't taking it lightly and you making them feel guilty about it does NOT help! Mind your own business! They didn't ask for your opinion on it!|`|Og09Q7ylaa	As far as I know, those are the only available options for a medical abortion. You may want to consider a surgical abortion, though. Don't let the religious whackos make you think that you are "killing a pwessus ickle baby." It's a blob of tissue that has no thoughts or feelings.|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	I only thought there was one...

Coc593Ikaa	Calm down, this all makes sense. <br>  <br>  Pregnancy is dated NOT from conception, but from your last menstrual period!<br>  <br>  Ovulation generally occurs about 2 weeks into your cycle.<br>  <br>  Therefore, while you are 7 weeks pregnant, conception was only about 5 weeks away.<br>  <br>  So, when hubby was home in early Feb, you made your baby!<br>  <br>  Got it? All is well. Congratulations!<br>  <br>  ADD: Go by the ultrasound. Early ultrasounds are very accurate. HCG levels are not used to date pregnancy, as there is such a wide range of "normal". What I told you fits with the ultrasound.|`|quieXSekaa	I think that means you ovulated about 18 days into your cycle if you concieved on the 2nd-the 4th of feb. Which means your period was sometime around the 15th of January? Maybe  even a little bit later then that. Either way, That is what would make sense to me. I mean, look at my situation...I ovulated a whole week late and got  neg tests for a whole month and all of a sudden have super strong positives, so I'm obviously further along than 4 weeks. Hope this helped.|`|pod9nzo7aa	You will just have to find out in 9 months.
9Qf4khqLaa	Don't get pregnant until you're able to have stable medical insurance. Are you married? Does your partner/you have a full time job with benefits? Insurance isn't the only factor you should look at if youre trying to concieve.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Hmm, and people say that there is nothing wrong with the American health care system. Well, you could always take a long trip to Canada. <br>  <br>  No, but seriously, you have other options when it comes to having the baby like having a midwife assist with a home birth. I'm not sure how medicaid works, but if you can't afford insurance, maybe it's not the best time to be thinking about having a baby. I really don't want to be harsh, but diapers, formula, and other necessities can be really expensive.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Why would you get pregnant without insurance? Your child will need good health insurance as well and medicaid isn't the best coverage.  If you can't afford a baby, don't have one. It's pretty simple. Get your life together and learn to take care of yourself before you bring a child that depends on you into the world.|`|YG288fG4aa	Dont worry about what these other people have to say, if you want a baby have a baby and let the state pay for it, that's how they do it in canada and other countries. Other countries dont even have to pay for healthcare, its free!|`|yp9rEMSraa	You will be eligible....i dont live in FL anymore but i did at one time for almost 12 yrs....if you dont have insurance it will be covered....you can call and talk to someone about it but you will be covered.....|`|22bkUtWNaa	You should be careful to make sure that they won't charge you more if you apply AFTER you are pregnant. Insurances will treat pregnancy like a "pre-existing condition". Good luck!
QSybnIU3aa	i am 40 weeks +2 days now and i found sex really awful the last time we tried. the same as you i think, really sore and uncomfortable. i totally went off it though throughout my whole pregnancy for some reason so im sure my man will be pretty glad when the baby comes!!<br>  <br>  the only answer is dont do it if it doesnt feel comfortable, you havent long to go now anyway so dont torture yourself. <br>  <br>  i didnt like the thought of it and keep picturing the baby!! i know thats silly but it can be enough to put you off. <br>  <br>  just chill out and find other ways to have fun together. ;-)<br>  <br>  good luck with the rest of your pregnancy too xx|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Yes.

Good luck!|`|kziIf0r6aa	It all depends on how long ago your period was if its been more than a  month you might need to wait a couple more weeks before you do another test.  Otherwise get a blood test|`|Z3mLmDaJaa	get a blood test done there more acurate x good luck|`|Z7qxXNl0aa	well thats weird but maybe you should take a blood test and  see...but thanks for answering my questions...you might be pregnant
45xNJ7Ncaa	It's possible.  I just ovulated two eggs 2 days apart according to sonograms I had done.<br>  But you stated it's unconfirmed ovulation.  My guess is that fertilty friend was wrong this cycle.  I don't like those sited because they base ovulation on previous cycles or on a set number based on how many days you tell it your cycles are.  The problem is that cycles change and ovulation dates change.  A woman can go months or years having 28 day cycles and then suddenly have a 30 day cycle making ovulation later than what she's use to.<br>  I'm big on OPK but I know PCOS can interfer with regular lh levels so I would suggest having your ob/gyn help you.  He/she can see if your insulin levels are where they need to be and may even feel that Clomid may help you.  <br>  I would say based on what you stated, that you ovulated on the day or within 2 days of the EWCM.  LH is what causes the EWCM.  It's our bodies way of ensuring that sperm can get to the egg when the eggs released or about to be released.
E2UXN7J1aa	The baby will qualify now as well.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	If she gets it for her then yes. If you get it for her then no.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	No. Not unless the baby has a disability and she applies for it for her baby. But no she wouldn't get more for having a baby...|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Not unless the baby has a disability also and applies for SSI and gets approved.  The baby doesn't automatically receive SSI simply because the mother does.
Og09Q7ylaa	Yes, I am going to comment on "ur" language. And yes, it is possible to get p-r-e-g-n-a-n-t based on the information gives. You can take an emergency contraceptive if it has been 72 hours or less since you had sex.|`|YG288fG4aa	Pregnant. Possibly. Get birth control.|`|lrVbZdSDaa	If you are saying that he was inside of you for a few seconds, and then pulled out before anything really happened, especially with only one inch inside, no it's highly unlikely.<br>  <br>  It's not impossible, but if that's the story I'd say the chances are basically very nonexistent.  You have nothing to worry about for now.|`|ZcpefUf7aa	No and if you still fear it get the plan b pill it works as long as u use it within 72 hrs.  Did he pre nut???  If not you should have nothing to worry about.|`|V3ZyGJMtaa	you shouldnt but every body is different but i wouldnt see how you could be if you got up right way and cleaned up
rSXZOU5zaa	eh. its kind of hard to tell since those are the only symptoms. <br>  Good luck, though!<br>  :)|`|QSodlfMraa	honey take the test and congrats :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's quite a bit early for morning sickness that may be from something else. Just hang in there and test when your period is due.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Good news, it could very well be pregnancy.<br>  Bad news, it may just be your mind playing with you because you're putting too much thought into it.<br>  The only thing anyone could advise is to wait 3-5 days before your period and take a 1st Response Pregnancy Test or wait a few days after your missed period if you can wait that long.<br>  Good luck and barrels of baby dust!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	it's far too early for any morning sickness symptoms...they start at about 5 weeks<br>  <br>  good luck though<br>  <br>  4 Years??? You need IVF|`|3AMaOT7Naa	Maybe... And if you are really pregnant Congratulations! :)|`|fothUfW0aa	take the test!:)
UseJjREjaa	I wonder the same thing.  It seems like such a waist when u buy a 20 dollar outfit that they were once and end up selling it for 2 huh?<br>  <br>  Alot of yard sales and stuff around here sell onsies for like 10 cents<br>  bags of washclothes for 25 cents<br>  Whole outfits for 2-5 dollars<br>  <br>  I bought a almost brand new $40 bouncy seat at a yardsale for $7!<br>  I got a swing, basinet, carseat, 5 trashbags of BRAND NEW clothes and bouncy seats, plus much more for $100.. It was great because the women kept everything in really great condition plus her son was born the same month as mine just a year apart so everything was the right size for the right season..<br>  <br>  Wow this totally isn't answering your question but I'm bored and figured I'd inform you of my used clothing stories ... HA HA|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Probably just put them together as outfits and sell the outfits for 2-5 bucks a piece. As gently used as they are people don't want to spend to much on used baby clothes.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	i think you should GIVE them to a charity shop<br>  <br>  edit - you could sell them as one bulk load...and u could look for second hand stuff for ur daughter too...ebay springs to mind|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	I don't think your prices sound too out of line especially considering your circumstances.  Look for a free internet classified listing in your area.  If you have to pay to list them in a newspaper all your profits will go to pay for the ad.  With any luck someone will come in and buy it all.<br>  Good Luck, I hope things get better for you really soon!|`|AqVNrh8Haa	Try putting ads at various websites like myclozet and craigslist to get buyers.|`|MFWEkkd9aa	Why don't you give it all to charity?  <br>  That's what we do :) <br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x
E2UXN7J1aa	No. If it got infected that would be a big problem.|`|vUiUoamVaa	Yes, but why she would want to?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	a fake one.<br>  <br>  a real one NO WAY. . plus pregnancy is a time for glowing and being delicate.. not inking yourself.<br>  <br>  save that sh*t for later|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	It would be wise not to.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	no.|`|T1P6Ym3vaa	how about a big water melon for a stomach after she has the baby it will be a raisin. what are you nuts, whats next tattoo the fetus before it's born maybe pierce head to make an easier delivery you just cant wait to get a tattoo til after the baby is born whats the hurry|`|3xz9lgB4aa	No, she has to wait till after she's done breast-feeding|`|Kb9VusIfaa	NO!!! why? wait until the babys born. dont even get a tattoo that baby will be so embarrasesd to have parents with tattoos.|`|TU6hZ2Beaa	Don't do that. It will effect to the children.|`|040b69609e6a031b503a985b8d63b350aa	not supposed to or get their hair dyed.|`|kziIf0r6aa	No way|`|sIr2fWh6aa	NO!|`|xWoJooeMaa	as long as its not on her belly|`|LCzgIzdfaa	NO!!!
rSXZOU5zaa	Not now. There is a plan b pill, you have to take with in 3 days of having unprotected sex. If you are pregnant now, the only other pill you could take is an abortion pill.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can't do anything to prevent pregnancy now. You either are or you aren't. All you can do is wait and see if you get your period. If you don't then test. It's all you can do. The morning after pill only works within the first 72 hours and doesn't terminate pregnancy so it's really too late.|`|h2CyxOEnaa	dont do it again|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Are you sure you're 23? Anyways, that's irrelevant. You can get the plan B pill from your doctor. If you end up pregnant, you can;<br>  Get an abortion=(<br>  Have a miscarriage (cannot be self-induced)<br>  Have the baby and become a mommy (given the way you type, I would advise against it)<br>  Have the baby and give it up for adoption<br>  Have the baby and give the father full custody<br>  <br>  If you don't end up pregnant, use birth control next time.|`|52U22fiAaa	You can avoid becoming pregnant by taking the PlanB pill within 72 HOURS OF UNPROTECTED SEX.  If it's already been that long (which is HAS), then you would already be pregnant and if you ARE pregnant then it's called an abortion....you can't avoid being pregnant if you already are-get it?  <br>  <br>  Abortions are bad, btw.... bad bad bad.  Use a condom next time.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	"becuming" really?<br>  anyways.....<br>  <br>  go to the drug store and take a test<br>  then go to planned parenthood andget on birth control<br>  pill (daily)<br>  patch (weekly)<br>  shot (every 3 months)<br>  IUD (good for 5 yrs)<br>  or see what your other options are|`|rYCud1IQaa	Sorry honey but I don't believe that you're 23... surely a 23 year old would know a bit more about sex. Whatever, I could be wrong, that's just my opinion|`|trXjBRlRaa	At this stage you cannot avoid pregnancy if you truly are pregnant. There is a "Morning After" pill you could have taken, the morning after, but a month later won't help you.<br>  <br>  Take a HPT (home pregnancy test). If positive see the OB/GYN or go to a clinic such as Planned Parenthood. They can help you.<br>  <br>  There are many good people in this world that would love a baby and you can help them by providing a child if you are not in a place to care for it yourself, or fortunately you still have the right to choose abortion.|`|O3vmW6foaa	Cytotek is a drug that helps induce labor/misscarriage in a woman about 8-7 weeks pregnant. It can be used up to 10 weeks, but it's not safe or effective after then. <br>  <br>  It is not as effective taken orally as it is when placed inside the vagina against the cervix.<br>  <br>  Please take note that self-administered abortions after 9 weeks pregnant are strongly not advisable as parts of the placenta may remain behind in the mother until they start to rot. These retained fetal products in the mother can lead to death, if they are not removed (has to be done by surgery).  <br>  <br>  You are 3-4 weeks now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12393475	You will probably have to go to OBGYN or planned parenthood or something. If it was only a day or two you could've purchases Plan B (morning after pill) which is used up to 72 hours after unprotected sex, but this was last month.  You can also try purchasing a home pregnancy test to see if you could be pregnant.|`|oLj0VTX5aa	Uhm, you had the option of using pills immediately after your unprotected sex, but you don't really have the option of pills, now.  I really suggest you call Planned Parenthood and consult them over the phone - it is free, and they could give you more options than strangers on the net.  <br>  <br>  Use condoms - $8.00 for a box of Trojans, and less worry unless they break.|`|QB9szNYMaa	You should have used protection. Using the morning after pill could have aided you after you had sex, but it's too late now. The best thing to do would be to get a pregnancy test from a supermarket and make sure before doing anything else.|`|3F8XBNDNaa	To be honest, you've left it far too late to take precautions now. Do a home test and make sure you use contraception next time.|`|SmOefD5Raa	No, you need to have this baby and learn your friggin lesson.|`|4MzimIyFaa	pl use condoms avoid  ur pregency.|`|dM5u6UyHaa	It's still the first week of March, yo.
vNgDz5Jnaa	It's pretty high because that's right around the time she ovulates.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If she's ovulating there is a good chance of pregnancy. If this happened within the last 72 hours she can go to the pharmacy and get the Plan B morning after pill. It will prevent any egg that may have gotten fertalized from implanting and therefor no pregnancy.|`|rPywKtJRaa	well high....they would be lower if she were on a pill of some sort....<br>  Planned parenthood.....72 hour pill.....<br>  <br>  no pill huh?  if its a girl can you name her after me?   lol <br>  Joking.|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	chances are very high anytime the condom breaks,i know people that have gotten pregnant even when the condom hasnt broken. seeing she's not on any form of birth control chances are even higher. all you can do is take a test if she misses a period.<br>  good luck
lj3hNR9baa	Well, hope that your parents take the news that you got some girl prego good, and pray that her parents don't beat your ***.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Can you afford a child on a troll's salary?|`|qsqmykzsaa	well, you are in a mess now.<br>  you will firstly have to make sure she is pregnant.<br>  then parents will have to become involved.<br>  <br>  Good luck mate.|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	if she has a missed period then she will be able to do a home pregnancy test and it should be accurate. chances are high that she's pregnant.|`|EgUxu5kjaa	TROLL alert!<br>  you're an idiot!|`|cmoGATT9aa	ohh dear...<br>  wait a few weeks them buy a pregnancy test to ease your fears...|`|yNoENquTaa	i know this is easier said than done but the next thing to do is get a test to make sure she is pregnant and then tell yours and her parents. i'm not sure how they will respond. my mum was shocked and i was 17. and then the next step is to take it a day at a time. decide if you'll have the child and then you'll have to go to the doctors once a month usually for the next little while. make sure you're supportive and loving as this is a very stressful time. if you've got any more questions just jump on here and ask. you'll get lots of answers. =]<br>  best of luck and (maybe) congratulations.<br>  ???|`|b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	You are both the same age so neither gets arrested.  Now you know better. Take her to planned parenthood and see if the morning after pill is an option. At 14 the menstrual cycle can be quite irregular. Just stay away from her vagina until she has her period. From now on use condoms when you have sex so you can avoid having to ask this question. It's not all fun and games at 14 to be a parent..|`|VRSUyeqbaa	she very well could be, you will have to wait until she misses her period to be absolutely sure....if you are freaking out now, maybe you have learned your lesson?|`|e3a22386f5c6f18e62c9c97c3ced4a84aa	If you're in Malaysia, there's a statutory rape law which could put you behind bars.<br>  <br>  She should go see a OBGyn for conformation|`|3goRDv0gaa	well just cause she missed her period dont mean she can be pregnant<br>  <br>  but its VERY LIKELY!|`|oWlrhhyIaa	I doubt trolls are actually able to reproduce, so quit worrying!|`|52U22fiAaa	That sucks for you.  <br>  <br>  Consider adoption.|`|XKhNw221aa	You have two options, and both start with "A", just pick the right one.|`|AA11507024	you'll just have to wait and see|`|azE51WGRaa	Well, here's the deal. Go out and get a test done either at planned parenthood or at your health department. If it comes up negative, then ask for birth control because either place will readily have them available for you. If it's positive, then you'd better tell your parents (and hers too) because unless you give this baby up for adoption (I don't think you can really afford $500.00 for an abortion..yes, that's how much they really cost, thank god), then your (and hers too) parents will end up with the wonderful joy of supporting your child until you get old enough to get a job. Good luck with this...you gotta grow up and face the facts. You did this, now you have to live with it whether its good or bad.|`|fNdWcGIYaa	Im sure you didn't mean for anything loike this to happen but my situation is worse i was like raped and i am 13 and pregnant. I don't know but i think that you should tell someone weather it is your um her mum or even you brother or best friend you really have to tell someone you trust. I know situationmsd can be tempting. You should tell the gurl that you should never have an abortion if you want help or want to talk to someone in a similar situation and similar age please add me on msn or email me on pink-angel-kitty-101@hotmail.com|`|q31cxfCTaa	Your parents need to know first thing. Don't put it off. She needs care and both of you guy's parents probably will be willing to help her. If not go to someone that loves both of you and who you trust. This is VERY important because there are a  lot of risk if she doesn't get the right care especially because she is so young. Be there for her. Understand that she is going through a very difficult situation.<br>  you can email me anytime for anything:ceceliaeparsons@gmail.com <br>  questions, problems, anything.|`|HkDUxkS4aa	What did you expect was going to happen if you had sex at ur age, with NO CONDOM... maybe you will learn a lesson with this...<br>  <br>  Buy a test and get her to pee on it, then you will find out...How late is she more then 2 weeks? If Not, it could be nerves.<br>  <br>  Also she could still be too young to be able to carry a child in her young body even tho she had her period<br>  <br>  Honestly, use your brain next time!|`|oc5Fq8Gpaa	ok, well there several ways to take care of this:<br>  <br>  A.Have her get a abortion<br>  <br>  B. Have her have the baby, then put it up for adoption.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  C. Have her have the baby, then keep it.<br>  <br>  and one day u have to tell ur parents and she has to tell her parents so most likly there will be drama and it will be emotional.  I WISH U GUYS GOOD LUCK!|`|GmQosBg9aa	your an idiot of taking advantage of her like that.<br>  if she is pregnant stay with the baby!<br>  you have to help her.<br>  this is what happens when you don't think!<br>  grrr|`|3F8XBNDNaa	Well that was a silly thing to do wasn't it! Ask her to do a home test or go to a clinic, this is the only way you'll know for sure.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Hahahaha! "Can you afford a child on a troll's salary?" I'm sorry that was hilarious. Oh and thanks for the 2 points.|`|6UDSSn0aaa	Dear child God cannot help you now !!!|`|DUjr9tNUaa	...|`|eRCLtUZ2aa	well how would you know she's pregnant|`|PBQA8tJ0aa	chill you dont know yet...|`|AAjMQtzUaa	i would wait until you are certain that she is pregnant, and if she is stick with her it takes 2 to tango and it is both your resposibility, telling your parents will be the hardest part but you will get through it, just remember you are very young and once the baby comes along make sure you take advice and all the help you can get, but believe me even though you are both only young you will love the baby what ever and take the responibility of looking after it and taking care of it as much as you can and also go and do some more study so you can get your self a good job when you are a little bit older so you can look after your child, i dont believe in telling you to tell her to have an abortion because you are at an age where you both knew what you were doing and now you have to have the responsibility to deal with it, maybe next time you will be a little more careful, but good luck with the test results...........
wNtW1hXLaa	Hi! I have a 3 month old daughter. Just give yourself time. Eating a healthy well balanced diet, drinking plenty of water and getting as much sleep as possible will help your overall well being. It will get easier and you will get better at squeezing things in. Morning and afternoon walks in the fresh air with the baby in the pram is a good way to get back into the swing of things. If the weather permits on your side of the world! Swimming laps is wonderful as it simultaneously works every muscle in the body but is low impact. What about a yoga or low impact aerobics dvd that you can put on when the baby is asleep or playng. In time, focus on cardio and getting your heart rate up (eg. cycling, jogging, boxing) to initially shed the pounds. Then you can move on to ab crunches and weight training to tone up again. Good luck and enjoy!|`|HlX9tmndaa	I know you're really, really going to hate to hear this, but it just takes time.  I was in a funk after I had my son.  I remember WANTING to go shopping (my guilty pleasure as well), but just not bringing myself to be able to.  You may find that in time, you'll love looking at those cute clothes again.  In the meantime, talk to friends, family, anyone who could understand what you're feeling.  I found that getting a new haircut and color helped me.  Somehow just doing something a bit different with myself was nice.  Realize that it takes time to lose the baby weight in a healthy way for you, and give yourself time to adjust to everything. Make sure to set aside some YOU time...that was one thing I didn't do, and I should have.|`|zHG5gjBZaa	I too know how you feel this depresses me big time.. I have lost since my bub born 15kg the first 9 kg just went straight away and now its soooo slow.

I try to get out of the house more and get some fresh air. its hard after haveing a baby cause you dont fell good about yourself. i use to have abs and now i have long huge stretch marks and two stomach. not to make it about me but maybe it will help knowing your not alone.  do the thing you enjoy doing now. and concentate on your baby. they are the best thing in life. and my daughter is really all i care about. your baby will make you feel wonderful.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	you can start by knowing that you didnt eat burgers to gain that 20lbs...and a little exercise can help you feel good about yourself. i always was a fitness fanatic. i worked out during my pregnancy and still gained 45lbs. thankfully i walked out the hospital 20lbs lighter it gave me a head start. i hit the gym 3 day after i gave birth and every other day since.  i lost alot but its hard to move the last 10lbs...i realized that it takes time for you to lose pregnant weight cause its not like calories or fat....so in the past three wks i stopped working out and now the weight is falling off....time and a little exercise is good too and lots of sleep when you can get it|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	It took you nine months to grow that belly and put on the pounds, it may take some time to come off.  I know you are anxious, and it will happen.  It just takes time.  Right now your hormones are fluctuating like crazy which makes the weight harder to loose.  Also you are probably sleep deprived, that doesn't help either.  At least you have a good excuse. The weight will come off, it's just a little harder.  Drink plenty of fluids go heavy of the fruits and veggies and it will come off!<br>  Good Luck
uIAOcAMZaa	I would avoid anything starting in a B or ending in a -r. Taylor Baker, for example, sounds awkward, as does Bonnie Baker.

AA11223092	bedwetting is normal. i myself, now 16. have been a bedwetter from 7yrs old all the way to 11yrs old. every singe night i would wet the bed. but i finally grew out of it. the most common reason for bedwetting is an undeveloped bladder and/or deep sleeper.|`|fNv2Re6baa	When my daughter had the same problem, I used to wake her up at 11.30pm, when I usually went to bed, and I would take her to the toilet be she returned to her bed and fell straight to sleep again. This, as well as not letting her drink many fluids close to bed time allowed her to empty her bladder in the middle of the night. After only a couple of months, she was fine and didn't need to be woken up at all as she could last the entire night. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and keep persevering!|`|72LvOwEhaa	<a href="http://givinginfo.reads.it" rel="nofollow">http://givinginfo.reads.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|jf8nrfHZaa	If you go to www.goodnites.com they have a lot of advice for kids who wet the bed. I would also recommend getting some.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Bed wetting into early adolescence is quite normal for both boys and girls...   <br>  <br>  I wet the bed until about age 11..  My parents and I tried everything from limiting liquids to wet alarms (alarms that would go off in the first seconds of wetting... they are supposed to wake the person so they can stop and get the the bathroom... didn't work I slept through the alarm) to my parents waking me in the night to go... Etc.... <br>  <br>  What finally worked for me was a mental suggestion I gave myself...  I wore my pajamas inside out one night and woke up in the morning dry (for the first time in memory) I convinced myself that it had something to do with wearing the pajamas inside out...  I wore my pajamas inside out for the next several years waking up dry...  It wasn't until I was married that I started wearing my pajamas right-side out again...  Whatever works... <br>  <br>  Talk with your son about trying various methods, let him make suggestions, having him be part of the process of finding a solution will help him feel impowered and less adrift...<br>  <br>  In the meantime purchase 2 complete sets of bedding and 2 plastic sheets...  Place a plastic sheet on the matress and make up the bed with the layers of bedding..  Cover with the other plastic sheet and make up the second layer of bedding...  When your son wets at night he can easily get up, pull off the upper plastic sheet and everything above it, change into dry pajamas and sleep in the lower bedding...  <br>  <br>  Teach your son to place his bedding in the washer in the morning and you are set...|`|l195kTc6aa	yes my boyfriends son who is 7 now has recently started to wet the bed out of no where....and he doesnt see his mom much, cuz she is a bit of a mess...but we noticed that there is a pattern he wets the bed after he see his mom on a vist that night....and we think it is emotional stress...this is our theory....but at the same time it can be normal...so maybe make sure he goes to the washroom before he goes to bed and dont let him have to much to drink 2 hours before he goes to bed....hope this helps....google it it's pretty normal.
2n0vR0OMaa	Barbara Coloroso who has written several great parenting books says before you pick an argument with your teen ask "Is it illegal, immoral or life-threatening?" If it isn't let it go, pick the battles that are important to win.<br>  Be consistent, Let them help in the decision making.<br>  If you make threats, make them realistic "You're grounded for a year"is hardly going to happen.

r7q8LW7Aaa	I found that too - I never used it again. My daughter is now 3 and has dermatitis on her scalp - I'm not blaming that shampoo, I'm saying that she obviously has a very sensitive scalp.<br>  If the cradle cap comes back - give him a bath and wash his hair well, then just use a fine toothed plastic nit comb to pull the gunk out. It's not pleasant, but it's gentle and it works. I did that with my second and it hasn't came back since.|`|50lIaC8zaa	Oh, I used it on my LO when she was younger and she was fine, i don't remember it making her head red!!!<br>  <br>  Is there a number on the bottle or the box you could ring and speak to them?

I took my daughter off it after a week of using it, It smelt very strong, too strong. Tasted terrible! I wouldn't put it in my mouth and didn't want to put it in hers and her stools went very watery. I thought it was really bad and chucked it in the bin! As a result of it i don't like the brand Dentinox and think it's way too strong for babies! Sounds like it could be the same with the shampoo judging by what you say. I'd use a different brand i was you.|`|hmX4ko0Eaa	It's the rubbing action you use to massage the shampoo into the scalp that causes the redness.

T0gv52CDaa	Getting a 4 week old on a schedule is nearly impossible.  All you can really do is make sure that being awake during the day is a lot of fun - read to her, play with her, sing to her, etc.  Starting at the time you would like her to go to sleep, make life very boring.  Keep the room dark, hold her and feed her, either sing lullabies or play soothing music, but don't bring out any toys or start any fun activities.  Eventually she will learn that night time is for sleeping and that day time is for fun and games, but it will take some time.|`|59821ioeaa	Probably not at this point. There is hope though...my 2 month old is now sleeping through the night. The trick is to try and keep them busy and awake during the day. Eventually they find their own schedule, good luck.|`|kBVCZK0Haa	sounds like she is on a schedule sounds just like my daughter. She even cluster feeds in the evening it drives me crazy, this is what i do cause it works for me. Try side feeding lay her on your bed and lay next to her and feed her if she lets go see if she still wants it. My daughter will let go then start fussing 5-10 mins later its like she already has add ha ha. but eventually she falls asleep, after about an hour. but if you do this she will probably wake up at 12, 4 then 7 that's what my daughter does now i almost liked it better the other way cause she only woke up twice at night. i hope this helps.|`|pXSKSS3daa	No, it really is not. At that age their sleeping and eating patterns are still very sporadic. Most babies don't get on a natural routine until closer to 3-4 months.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Unfortunately, a baby's sleep patterns are usually controlled by their bodies (vs outside factors) until about 3 months of age.  There might not be a lot you can do....<br>  <br>  I am really impressed if your baby is up from about 3 pm to midnight. Most babies that age stay up for only about 2 hours a time w/o needing a nap.  If you try and watch closely for sleepy signs (yawning, blank stare, face or ear rubbing, turnign head away from you), you might find she will actually be willing to go down for a third nap in the evening (probably still waking at midnight to feed).  At least a late afternoon or evening nap might help her be less fussy from overtiredness late in the day.<br>  <br>  You can always try a bedtime routine or sleepy cues (like swaddling, singing, etc) to signal to her that it is time to sleep earlier, but that is something else the often doesn't catch on until 3 months or so.<br>  <br>  If she is being pretty consistent in her nap and night sleeping times, you are pretty far ahead of teh game already compared to most babies her age. I think you may just have to match her schedule to hers instead of vice versa for a few more months.  It doesn't sound all that incompatable with a typical work schedule.<br>  <br>  One thing that will help you out is that 4 weeks is a great time to introduce a bottle w/o fear of nipple confusions. I assume you are starting to do this anyway since you are going back to work soon.  Maybe your husband would be willing to do the first night feeding and watch her until she goes to sleep at midnight, so you would be able to get a decent night's sleep before feeding her at 4.
bslnV3Ovaa	Money wise it wasn't too difficult until they hit the school years. One more addition didn't make much difference as far as the grocery bill and other things. Hand me downs (clothes and toys) came in handy, the third child was much easier to take care of due to more experience and the other siblings helping out and entertaining. The money crunch began during the school years....because this is when the child technically becomes "one". Their own school clothes, own books, own supplies...but buying in BULK helped that a lot too. Actually buying in bulk cost about the same as having 2 children. Day care will obviously cost more..I was a stay at home mom until my youngest entered school. My youngest was and is the biggest joy of my motherhood. If your going to have another child do it now.....it's a lot easier when your younger...look at it as these are the mothering years. You won't regret it. I returned to school for my nursing degree when my youngest went to school. Since you are already taking online classes your one step ahead of the game. Good Luck Dear!|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	I'm the mother of three older children and our family income is the same as yours.  If you are good at budgeting, using coupons, shopping at thrift stores and yard sales, you will have everything you need and do well.  My third child had colic, so I really had a rough first couple of months.  Then there was a time I had three children at three different schools and I did alot of running.  You will do fine.

I had 3 who were in school and had a forth after 5 yrs, so it really doesn't matter! Go for it  and GL!|`|EHmLgpr6aa	We have three with two on the way and my husband makes only a bit more then yours. I would say however, if you are going to be pursuing a career at the same then I wouldn't suggest it. The reason I say this is pregnancy is EXHAUSTING enough, and you put two kids on top of that and your walking dead. Then when baby comes, you'll surely have your hands full. Personally, financially you'd be fine so long as the cost of living isn't outrageous. <br>  I look at it this way- children aren't as expensive as people make them out to be... it's LIFESTYLES that are expensive.|`|VZZs5N7Raa	My husband and i were doing great when we had only the 2 kids. Then we decide on a 3 because he wanted a son. Now the problem is we did not anticipate how expensive it would be now to raise another child, and the time and energy that goes into raising three children. Now it is so hard. My husband work in a hospital making 79 thousand per year i am in nursing school full time and work part time from home making 27 thousand and it is hard. Kids are alot of work i love my kids to pieces but with everything going sky high a gallon of milk is now $4 and a pack of diaper is $20. Our family income is more than yours and we are finding it difficult with three kids to keep up our life style and give the kids what they need. Good luck to you|`|a5ef125f73c7e0507eb991485e86abc2aa	Well, I had my daughter and was on my own at nineteen. I vowed I would not be one of those young girls that continues to have babies w/o care of having a stable family. When my daughter was five I met a great guy and we were married a year later. We had a son right away, and we wanted more, but I wanted to enjoy the new baby. My daughter was in school full time and I worked part time (my hubby only made $10/hr full time and then did part time pizza delivery. We lived in a two bedroom. Anyway we went to our best friend's wedding and had a REALLY good time. We had our second son nine months later. We have struggled, but it was a little easier with great family and friends, not to mention my second son gets all my first sons clothes (it saves a lot). It also helps that my daughter was born in Sept, my 2nd Feb., and 3rd July, which means plenty of time to save for parties and presents. Honestly it couldn't have worked out better. It's been a tough road, but worth it. I know it is important to have money to provide the basics, but you don't need to spoil them. I think it teaches them there is much more important things. My daughter is in 6th grade and my sons are still at home with me. Although we couldn't afford preschool for either of them, they are very smart and I know they will do well when they go to regular school (my son will start this year). For their social skills, I worked at a health club with free daycare for 4 hrs 2 days a week, and also had  church and church outings. All my kids are a blessing and they do well in all aspects. God has blessed us more than we could've asked. Good luck in your desicion making, really sit down and talk long and hard with your hubby. I hope I helped a little.|`|4aa60d2f8f77565f9209f279c1f9dcacaa	We have three children as well and live quite comfortable on 36,000 a year. The biggest things that help us out are budgeting and just plain being thrifty. (I love the Tightwad Gazette by Amy Dacycyzn) <br>  <br>  The biggest thing I experienced going from two to three children was exhaustion, especially since the youngest are only 2 years apart. Other than that I wouldn't trade it for the world, except maybe to have another. lol.|`|EkjoXU8eaa	I am a mother of three grown children.

You can make it on the money your husband brings in. God will provide your needs. I wish you luck whatever you decide. 3 children are no harder than 2. It gave my girl another little girl to play with. Good luck and God bless.|`|j5NqrQMXaa	dont have another kid until you get you schooling done.|`|sFVc4zkRaa	We have 5. The biggest change was between 3 and 4 Then the 5th was no biggy. Most people say it's the 3rd thats a bigger adjustment. As far as money, we are only making it with God as the head of our home. He provides us all the money we need.

All kids are hyper and you should look out for signs like tantrums, not listening to you (ignore you), and if you are concerned you should take her to a dr and they will test her.|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	yes|`|217bae54c617b0aaf543f873e23468deaa	I'd say yes because one of the questions I was asked was does anyone in your family have it.  Both my kids are ADHD and we think their dad is undiagnosed ADHD.|`|6ede278dac24f42ef2fcfa1b950c9f9aaa	I got it from my Dad and he uh ... uh .... what?|`|Fce7xiJSaa	The tendencies are inherited in some families.  Sounds like your daughter may have some possible symptoms, but you don't say how old she is.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you could also be looking for symptoms, or reading things into her behavior.  If her behavior is a problem for her, get a good evaluation.

I know lots of people whose nickname has nothing to do with their real name what so ever. Think of all the Flounders, Boons, Weasels and so on out there.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	maybe Cole. =]|`|hWe8vhKKaa	cole would be the closest|`|BMri9tITaa	District.  Or Wash.

Good name.|`|ovBNlMTsaa	coke. short for cocaine|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Colbi is what I would choose I think for a nick name.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Carl is a good nickname.
YAiKlPkMaa	They think they deserve the same pay as a daycare. I think for $8 an hour they better be doing arts and crafts and cleaning the house.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	This seems to really vary where one lives, and who and what the circumstances are. Casual babysitters, often teens, get paid less. I know in our city, there was a serious movement the last few years to ensure they are getting minimum wage.<br>  We just didn't use babysitters with our family, no need to do so really. We did everything together - and if I had to go out, or when I worked casual some evenings, my husband was at home.<br>  When I was starting babysitting in the '70s (yes, old..)  when I was 10 - started out getting 35 cents an hour, then it went up to 50 cents after a while. Those good old days not only included babysitting, but washing their dinner dishes, and other stuff like vacuuming, too!|`|AkFag8tNaa	Actually, if any "non skilled" job should be higher paying than it used to be, it should be babysitting. We are after all talking about putting a child's life in the hands of someone other than it's parent. I babysat for 2 dollars an hour and believe me, if I hadn't been friends of the family, I would have balked.<br>  <br>  I understand that it's not the same as daycare but when people get paid more to dunk fries in grease, I guess it gets me worked up.....|`|AA11327039	I think it depends on the neighborhood and what the family can actually afford.  If you live in a 1000 sqft house then you're probably a bit more down to earth and the neighbor kids are willing to do anything for a buck......but if you live in a 4000 sq ft house the neighbor kids probably have higher priorities...meaning they want you to dig deeper into your pocketbook.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	i know, when i was a kid i was paid $5, for a whole day, up to 8 hours, now i see spoiled teenagers wanting $25 an hour, babysitting isn't even a job, $25/hour as as much as a teacher makes, are you a teacher? no<br>  i understand that the price of things has gone up, but still, that doesn't mean you get the same amount as a lawyer, or a surgeon|`|0vjBjkHvaa	my mom babysat as a teen and she told me she got paid 5 to 8dollars per hour depending on the family for all kids.and that was in the 70's. im 14 and i babysit and my minimum is 7 per hour in the morning and afternoon and 10 per hour at night and im CPR/AED certified. that is a really low reasonable price for these days. ive seen people ask for 15 per hour! its 5 to 10 max is a really good price these days. and btw i don't choose my prices the parents do. some pay me more.|`|m2cxGTwgaa	im certified, 16, and get 8$/hr.<br>  i dont think its over priced because teenagers<br>  1. have other things to do.<br>  2. could have a normal job, but is helping you<br>  <br>  its hard for adults to get babysitters sometimes, and they usually pay more, to be able to keep the sitter, and keep her interested. i used to sit at leaast twice a week and yould get, 80-ish bucks every 2 weeks.<br>  it was better then a normal job, price wise, but i didnt like all the friday nights, and every few days after school, so i quit.|`|Qydtjz2naa	I babysit for the same family every sunday, I get five dollars an hour for two kids, sometimes three kids.  I think that's a fair amount.  I have a friend who got paid $20 an hour, and it was at night so all she had to do was put the kids to bed then watch t.v.  I think that's crazy.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Hell I would babysit for that kind of money.Beats the hell out of flipping burgers for less money...................or digging ditches.<br>  <br>  I never had a babysitter when I was a kid,but my female friends would get about $5 for a night.|`|a8IRxC4raa	Several reasons, the most important of which is that kids who sit have choices about jobs nowadays.  Why sit for two bucks an hour when you can get a better job that pays more?<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	It's a good thing I don't often need a sitter. I guess I am a tight wade because I wouldn't pay a sitter more then $3 an hour.|`|AA11296044	It really depends upon the activity and the baby sitter.  I pay mine $10-$15 depending upon duration and what is involved that day.<br>  <br>  I have very active 7 year old boys and a great babysitter who always brings activities, keeps them well entertained.  She is 17 Y/O and certified.  She get paid $10/hr before 9 pm and $15/hr after.<br>  <br>  I consider it money well spent.  She will often bring baking projects, science experiments and games.<br>  <br>  I used to make $5-$10 per hour depdnging upon number of children. That was 10-15 years ago, I too was certified.<br>  <br>  A good baby sitter is absolutely skilled help.   When I am out I want to ensure my children are enjoying themselves and expereicing activities which they may not get to do on a day to day basis.  I hire a good baby sitter so that my children are not parked in front of a TV.  They are learning how to make potato batteries,  zucchini bread and all and all having a great time.|`|ko3Larigaa	I dont do the dollar per hour thing I get paid around 15-30 dollars for each time i babysit which is usually for 4-9 hours. <br>  <br>  I put the kids to bed most of the time or I go after they are asleep and still get paid around that much.<br>  <br>  It usually because the parents feel bad if they are out late so they feel like they should pay more. that what my neighbors do. <br>  <br>  I got $15 last nite for 8 PM -11 PM|`|1uekFEhVaa	I'm fourteen and I babysat a kid for 7 bucks an hour.<br>  She was a brat, but it was worth it.|`|txv7TIgiaa	WHO IS GETTING PAID $8 I ONLY GET $3 PER HOUR I WORK FOR THE STATE OF OREGON! where do you live?|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	It mostly depends on where you live and how many kids you have.  I live in Charlottesville, Virginia and everything is expensive around here!  I babysit for one lady that has 3 kids for $14 an hour.  I didn't ask for that much, she offered it.  I probably would have asked for $12.  I babysit for another lady with one child for $10 an hour.  I don't work for less than $10 an hour.  There's no point in it unless they're right next door.  I don't see how anyone could expect to pay less than $8 or $9 an hour.  It would just be rude.  Gas may not be too expensive right now, but if that's the babysitter's only income, then there's other things to consider too.  $3 an hour is not at all reasonable.  That money would be all used up in gas by the time the babysitter got home!|`|j2mRop0laa	I think more and more babysitters are getting *certified* and taking CPR and first aid classes. That increases their value.<br>  <br>  As an adult, there is no way I would take a job paying $2 or $3 per hour. <br>  My time is worth more than that.<br>  <br>  As a teen I would have only done it if it was minimum wage. Otherwise I would have gone to the movie theater and sold tickets for 5.15.
z6IekuwSaa	I've tasted it all. lol. cereal, the few veggies and fruits she's tried. I even accidentally got a squirt of breastmilk when I was trying to unclog her bottle. lol. My hubs laughed cuz the same thing happened to him, he set me up! lol I think it's good to know what your kids are eating (jarred food wise)|`|rjVALevtaa	Nope, baby food is very bland to adults, although it isn't to babies. If he's happy with it that's all that matters to me.|`|SIhEme03aa	Yep, so far I've tasted all the fruits and veggies. I'm a little wary about trying the meat though.|`|G6eBvDz8aa	I will & I've tried her formula.. Enfamil is disguestinggggggggg!!!|`|PeEIuzP5aa	Yes i would test taste the food, your baby can not tell you if the food test bad or not. the other thing is that you might want to do is, is your child 4months? if he/she is you might want to start them on table food that you know that it taste good and your baby will love it. I did with both of my two children and they both turned out fine. in case you where wondering what i gave them i gave them potatoes, peas, corn meat and put into a blinder.|`|AA11197832	Yeah, I was curious as to what I was shoving into my baby's mouth.  So yes Im sure Ive tasted them all.  Veggies (ick) and the fruits.  There's absoulutely nothing wrong with that.  Oh unless you really enjoy it lolol.  J.K.|`|delMvf8iaa	Yes I sure did and a lot of it was nastey .So I now make all my babies food .Its cheaper and taste better.I blend what ever we have and make it the right texture for her.I|`|CpWGvDvRaa	yes, my hubby and i have tasted everything our kids eat. Still do with our son and he is 11. We call it "checking for poison"; which is followed by a "mooooommmm" or "daaaadddd" and a big sigh. He knows...lol|`|IOU6zo9Raa	i have tried all of them. If it was nasty, like the turkey, I completely understood why she wouldn't eat it. It didn't taste like turkey anyway!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I always taste everything.  Why make my son eat something that I won't even eat?  And also, I do it to test the temperature of the food to make sure it's not too hot, or too cold.  Sure some are gross to my tastes, but he enjoys most that I have given him.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I have tried anything I have ever feed my son.  I wouldn't feed him something that I wouldn't even be willing to test.
IXBl5l5kaa	Darn, I guess someone thinks the TV is going to swallow your baby whole lol....<br>  <br>  I'm sure you are like me, possibly a full-time working mother with house work on top of all that and sometimes, if it entertains your child, the TV is helpful noise and scenery.<br>  <br>  I have Baby Einstein Monet and it's ok. Kind of weird like the 1st one said. The puppet guys are the creepy ones lol. But I like the colors and the concept of the seasons. She's 8 months old so she doesn't get that part obviously, but she paid attention to the colors when it was on. <br>  <br>  We watch a lot of Noggin and Sprout network as well if we have the TV on when she's around. Normally it's just whatever I'm watching because sometimes Little Bill and Oswald get old lol|`|dW4DbkCLaa	I rented a baby Einstein video from Netflix for my 7 month old, I believe it's called Neighborhood Animals, and I thought it was really cute. I think I liked it more then my little girl because she was playing with her toys and rolling around on the floor and I was watching it. lol|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Ryan is also 5 months and the EXACT same way as your daughter. He will look past at the TV, he loves TV. He got a baby Einstein DVD for Christmas. I was not at all impressed.  I will usually have Disney channel playing in the mornings ( I also like the noise). They have a cute program by the Baby Einstein company called Little Einsteins.  Pretty much any show will catch Ryans attention|`|AA12243380	I like them a lot, but yeah, Mozart is a remedial one.  Try the My First Signs video!  That's a great one!|`|CpWGvDvRaa	My daughter loves them! We watch together and interact along. She cant point out colors, numbers and shapes now. She is 16 months. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: cathrl69: It is all in how you talk to people. Opinions are welcomed and accepted, but you have to know how to be cooth about it. <br>  <br>  There is a difference between opinions and rants. Play nice with others and they will play nice with you. Be a jerk and you will just look ignorant. Have a very pleasant day. :)|`|5c500787631901c9ca4d11eaca666897aa	There was a study done on this that showed that the videos actually can have a negative impact on iq scores. Babies learn from interacting with their environment, and the two dimensional tv just doesn't cut it for them. TV is fine for kids, but they aren't going to learn from it :)|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I think the baby Einstein movies are almost creepy.  I received a few and have popped them in on occasion.  I swear they brain wash my child!  Seriously, he will stare intently memorized by the screen.   It kinda freaks me out.  <br>  <br>  But when I have something on such as a soap opera during the afternoon, he pays no attention to it what so ever.  So, if anything,  I would say baby einstein is worse TV to have on then adult television,  because it does keep their attention solely on the television instead of having them go on about their business, play, and discover around the house like they should be doing.
Jy2RF9Szaa	It is very difficult to tell from what you've posted whether these issues are specifically tied to the child's adoption, or if she would have learning issues regardless of her background. So it's difficult to know if she needs adoption-related resources, or just learning-related ones. But assuming she needs adoption-related resoucres...<br>  <br>  Many children's hospitals have "International Adoption Clinics" with doctors who specialize in the health and developmental issues of international adoptees. These hospitals often offer consultations and assessments and can refer families to appropriate counseling/treatment services if necessary.<br>  <br>  I know that the University of Minnesota's program is one of the oldest, and is well respected. However, I noticed that there is also an International Adoption Clinic at MUSC in Charleston, SC. (I don't know anything about that one, so she might want to do some research on it before she decides, but... it might be a starting place since it's closer to home.)|`|yDWcYXl5aa	99.9% of schools don't have a doctor who could make a diagnosis that a child can't be helped.<br>  <br>  This child sounds like she's suffering from RAD (reactive attachment disorder), and needs acceptance, love, caring, and specialized programs to help her get through these feelings.  Of course a child like this is going to pass low on an IQ test.  She learned Russian for the first part of her life, and is having a lot to catch up on now.<br>  <br>  Please pass along to the school that I would never move my child to a school who says something like that about a child.  And let's face more here, most schools in rural communities of South Carolina don't deal with Russian adoptions very often.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.  I wish I knew more to tell you.
lkhCeAdJaa	Hooray for you!!<br>  I think your biggest adjustment will come in the form of surprise.  You will be surprised how absolutely EASY it is to have a single born (if it IS a single born!) baby compared to four at a time.  You will be surprised at all the whining you hear from other mothers on this sight who only have one baby and complain they can not possibly get everything done because they have that one baby.  You will feel renewed and alive to have such an easy job to do because,  after all, having four newborns at a time is something most of us wouldn't be able to handle!<br>  <br>  That's my prediction;-)<br>  <br>  I'm so happy for you!!!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	That is fantastic news and I hope things go well for you! How exciting!<br>  <br>  I'd say the sleep schedule will probably be the biggest adjustment. I know in many ways it will be for us, and our youngest is only 2 1/2. That and getting a routine down, although if you have older kids you will probably do great with their help. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|j2mRop0laa	OMG !! Candace! Awww I wish I could send you a virtual hug. That's amazing news. :)<br>  I'm really very happy for you. Thrilled!|`|AkFag8tNaa	That's great! I'd say the biggest adjustment will be getting up in the night again.....|`|AA12145826	OMG!!! Congrats Candace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sure the girls are SUPER excited to be big sisters!!<br>  <br>  Your biggest adjustment? Getting used to all the new contraptions that they have out now to make your life "so easy" with a newborn (you'll wonder why you didn't have them when the girls' were little).|`|UA8zGGTsaa	I'm so happy for you first of all, and second, your biggest adjustment will be only having one newborn to deal with, so I think it will be a lot less stressful. And you have ten helping hands in the house if you need some sleep.|`|32866571f9996aa9d609f6f782586569aa	Congratulations, and look yourself.  I had one girl and then twins with a gap of 19 years between them!  Being that bit older I was just a bit more tired but thats to be expected.  My lovely tidy house is now a chaotic mess and you know what, I wouldnt change it for the world.  I found I was that bit more relaxed with them too.  Enjoy!|`|CyeYMaUuaa	Wow, congratulations!<br>  <br>  Be the best mother you can and remember that you will have 5 helping hands- your quads and your husband.<br>  <br>  Is it alright if I add you? My email is acting up and I also have 5 daughters (1 is in heaven).|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	Congratulations! That's great news! I think the biggest adjustment would be the other child(ren) getting used to not having all the attention in the world but after a while, I think they will get used to it.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Congratulations! I'm so excited for you!!! Throw some of you luck my way!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	yay!!! thats sooooo great!!! yay for you.  awwww i've very happy for you congrats!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	CONGRATS!!! I think you will be great. A big readjustment-but a great one.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Congrats :)  I am so happy for you.<br>  <br>  I am in the same boat, it's been 9 years since I had a baby in the house (almost 10) but we will both have to get back into the sleepless nights and the having the be baby proof again.  No more just leaving little things all over the floor :)|`|xVEqBjDVaa	AWHH! yay!!! I am so happy for you!<br>  I think probably just having to get used to have a baby in the house will be a tough one. I would think.|`|Ds3SzraCaa	Congrats Candace!!|`|UIILEn0Uaa	OH MY GOODNESS!<br>  Ms. Candace!<br>  Congrats!<br>  Thats wonderful!<br>  <br>  I'm not EXACTLY sure what the question means.. but thats ok, right?<br>  I think that this baby could bring all your family closer together.  The only problem that I'm thinking is,<br>  theres probably going to be only one baby, and four older sisters.  There could be a few argunments.. over stuff like Whos turn it is to babysit(they probably all will want to)  But your baby will be very loved - i know that for a fact.  You are a great person, and I bet your husband is too, and with four older daughters - well, this baby can get no more love(:|`|TQW5E6olaa	Yay!!! congrats! Do you think you'll have another set of multiples or has it been confirmed its one?|`|F8KmTbqjaa	OMG baby #5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Your a brave lady!  It will be so easy after having 4 babies at once!  Good Luck to you and your family........im sure your girls are so excited to have a little brother or sister!
CdJtH0xdaa	I'm not in school =P<br>  Your last day of school is six days after my twentieth birthday|`|rPUewmhsaa	Most definitely. <br>  I get out May 28th.<br>  It kind of depresses me because I've really liked this year and I only will have one year left at my school. My school is currently 5th through 8th grade. During this school year they built a second building right next to the original. Next year the new building will be the Intermediate for 5th and 6th grade and the current building will be the Junior High for 7th and 8th. But either way, I'm still going to be an 8th grader next year and I've loved my school a whole bunch. It's only 3 years old (well after this school year it will be). <br>  So yeah, it depresses me. :(|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	I'm not sure when my last day of school<br>  is but it's like half way through June.<br>  <br>  The winter seems to be going by pretty<br>  slowly but once it gets nicer outside it'll<br>  go by really fast.<br>  <br>  I'm excited! :)|`|vp1K0bxwaa	My last day is June 9th I believe.<br>  <br>  It's gone by at a decent pace, but I wish it was the week after next.|`|kVZoeh9paa	yea, i can actually remmeber the first day of school! :P  and thats comin from the girl with short term memory.<br>  <br>  i think im out around july 15th not sure..|`|E6T9DPT9aa	very! 7 weeks left! last day 8th May!<br>  xxx|`|v9bTfQGMaa	Not really<br>  <br>  Last day: June 10th|`|o3rTWrWPaa	yes it has but im ok with that :)<br>  june something.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Im guessing you live in the US?<br>  I live in Australia so our school year is very different to yours.<br>  We started school on February 2 (that was the start of the new school year) and we finish school on December 1st this year and have the equivalent to your summer break.<br>  We have 3 sets of 3 week holidays in between also.<br>  <br>  So I have only been at school for just over 4 weeks haha, its gone pretty fast so far.|`|LQ7rROMSaa	They really do mean it when they say the high school years go fast.! Sophomore year is already ending for me. We were supposed to get out May 27, I think, but because of the snow days we had we're making it up, so I have school until June 3. My summer's going to be short, though. I go back August 17. Ahhh, lol.|`|UIILEn0Uaa	Yes it has,<br>  each hour seems long, but then the day seems short, and so does the week, then the month.. then the quarter.<br>  where is time going?<br>  <br>  My last day of school will be June 2, it would have been earlier, but we had a few snow days.|`|b2ef69c67e136d3bdd82ab0851201d08aa	I graduate May 19th!

Basically the last two weeks are the Edusoft test which is like finals, Day On The Green, 8th graders going to Paramount Great America, 8th grade promotion dance and the ceremony...<br>  <br>  Basically the last two weeks of 8th grade is just chill time. The Edusoft is easy and doesn't really count since grades are turned in like the first week of June or the last week of May.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Yes, this school has been one of the fastest I've had.  Summer is like right around the corner, but it feels like we just ended summer not too long ago.  My last day is umm I don't know, I'll go look.<br>  <br>  Edit: The last day for our school district is June 4th, but I get out earlier because I don't have to take 5, out of 8, finals this year|`|emkT1a6raa	My school lets out June 16th, then until the 23rd we have tests. Only 100 days to go until June 16th :-)|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	Yes, very fast.<br>  Umm, I'm not sure, depends when my last exam is.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, of course you know that there is a possibility of pregnancy here, but if I were you I would not worry too much about it yet, at least until you test again! If you have not even missed your period yet it would be unlikely for you to be be getting morning sickness/nausea already. That shows up a bit later most of the time. I don't remember having a dry mouth, in fact I think a more common symptom is excessive salivation, but that doesn't mean it is not a symptom, I'm just unfamiliar with it.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that I tested with an early results test with first morning urine about 5 days before I was due to have my period and I did get a fairly obvious positive result. So it is up to you if you want to test again now or not. If you do, I would wait and take it in the morning so the hormones would be more concentrated in your urine. But, again they are less accurate before you actually miss your period, so if you get a negative result you should probably wait and test again.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you. And I don't blame you for not wanting to tell your mom or MIH that you are suspecting pregnancy if you don't know what's going on yet. :]|`|vygYFdsSaa	Hi sweetie. Try not to symptom spot too much, it'll drive you crazy. Dry mouth can be attributed to many many other things than pregnancy. Have you missed your period yet?? If its too soon for a test its generally too soon to be feeling morning sickness, perhaps you are just ill. Good luck xxx|`|ppG2smDWaa	How don't you know someone that has been pregnant? What about your mother?|`|r9Cuqpw7aa	Okay you can calm down, I don't think that you are pregnant, when you begin to suspect that you are you'll start to notice way more "symptoms." Maybe you actually wake up with drymouth pretty often, but you never noticed until now. S'far as getting sick in the morning you said you just changed your sleeping schedule, right? Then the sickness is probably because of that, nothing more.
LUg9dgb5aa	Well, at school start off by smiling.<br>  and, make small conversation if possible.<br>  Like, if your with friends, and he is too,<br>  go up and start talking to them. Soon,<br>  you guys will be friends. It might take time,<br>  but after a while, things wont be so arkward.<br>  Good luck. [:<br>  <br>  what i mean is, go with your friends. and start talking<br>  to him, and his friends. If, possible. If not, just smile,<br>  and maybe he'll get the picture that you want to be friends.<br>  Try messaging him too, and just say. "Hey, whats up?"<br>  If he's a jerk, then you know that this isnt the type of person<br>  you want to be friends with again. and if he's friendly,<br>  then he obviously meant what he said! Good luck, again.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	Smile & just say "Hey, what's up?"|`|I64JOuMKaa	if he's asking your friend if you hate him<br>  i'm pretty sure he misses you , maybe being together or just misses you as a friend.<br>  <br>  wait for him to come to you first<br>  because if you come to him first<br>  then he will be like oh she misses me too she probably wants to get back together etc etc !<br>  you know guys LOL<br>  <br>  wait for him to msg you , or tell your friend to tell him to talk to you<br>  and if you wanan get back together maybe you can try<br>  but if you just want to be friends straight up tell him<br>  just be like<br>  heeey! i miss us being FRIENDS .. =) hows life? LOL<br>  <br>  good luck !|`|4HQfk7V8aa	I think you should find a time, maybe during changing classes, talk to him and tell him that you would rather be friends than boyfriend girlfriends.  There will be people around, so you wont be alone with him.  He will understand.|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Well you broke up with him because he was a butt so why would you want to be with him again. He will probably just do it over.
MHOxPs8Oaa	Honestly I was a pretty spoiled kid, but I looked forward to going to my grandpa's. He lived 5 hours away and I loved seeing him.  I loved going to the park, because where I lived we had a swingset, but I couldn't ride my bike or anything else because I lived in the mountains.<br>  <br>  Edit to Rainbow Sparkles: I have no idea where you live, but where I do Mac & Cheese is still cheap and so is the zoo.|`|j2mRop0laa	Everything is handed to them in school and activities. They get rewarded for everything a trophy just for trying.<br>  <br>  Lynn, I got an easter outfit and a basket with chocolate when I was a kid. My husband will probably buy the girls a wii game and a basket. Crazy times...|`|faLD7RiVaa	Saturday morning cartoons is definately a good example. Another for us was going out to eat. At the absolute most we went out once a week and that wasn't even regular. W/so many fast food restaurants and dollar menus it's almost a way of life for most people. (We still only do it once in a while but more frequently then we did when I was a child). <br>  Video games, we went to the local arcade after we busted our butts saving up enough money to go. Now everyone has at least one in their homes (we have 5 family systems, 5 handhelds-2 of which aren't played due to upgrades, a desk top w/multiple games on it as well as internet access and finally a laptop that we just purchased w/internet access to multiple games).|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I think the way of life is completely different now. When I was a kid, it was okay to eat Macaroni and cheese when we were broke and going to the zoo was affordable. Now days even Mac N Cheese is expensive and the zoo is a $50 trip.....<br>  <br>  <br>  When I was a kid, I always got a sticker at the grocery store but it seems like my son gets a toy everywhere we go.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Before I opened that, I had the same answer lined up!<br>  Maybe the cinema? It used to be such a big thing but it's not such a deal anymore.<br>  Plus I think kids expect too much now. Now we're supposed to get them gifts and outfits and toys just for Easter but my generation were over the moon to get a chocolate egg!|`|1uvrkDWNaa	I remember as a kid, going to McDonald's was a rare treat.|`|f6qmRicQaa	I'm with Betty C, going out to eat.  When I was a kid it was such a treat.  We only went once a month!  It was a nice place with fantastic food and we always got to bring a friend.  Now it's no big deal.  I agree with the cartoons as well.  And Easter!  You guys are right.  I mean we dyed eggs and then the adults hid them and the kid that found the most got a prize.  Now there are toys, and huge ridiculous baskets.  Times have certainly changed.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My daughter loves going to walmart- because she gets a sticker. New toys are a special treat, we go to the mall to walk around and let her run around there ( my husband has Tuesdays off and we live in a small town there is maybe 20 people at the mall at 1) She gets to go and look at all the puppy and kittys in the pet store ( i HATE that place, she loves it). When I was little a special treat was just a special day with my mom, we would go to DQ and get a treat or something like that. My daughter will learn that the simple things in life are the most important.<br>  <br>  EDIT- so here is one i remember going to the doctors and was excited to get a sticker. My daughter who is 2 got some blood drawn. She didnt cry and was great. At the end the woman offered her either a TY Bennie baby ( or what ever those things are) or gushers. I was shocked those TY things are like 5 bucks a pop. She picked the gushers lol. OH also I understand the zoo thing, We do have a free so and we take advantage of that in the summer but sometimes in the winter you want to see those furry little animals. If we went to the state zoo it would easily be a 50 dollar trip ( we have been there once)|`|tBtOTiQDaa	christmas<br>  my family wasn't the richest, i only got a few christmas presents, and those that i got weren't the best either, not to say i wasn't thankful, but kids today want $500 ipods, and $6000 computers, and designer socks for $80, i was luucky if i got anything

Fish from time to time, when meat it's either chicken or minced.|`|08a1322a8b7849e448d2bb758fb41239aa	It's not a good idea to give them what you eat because of all the acid food we do eat can hurt their stomach's most of it is common sense. Don't give them too much fried food. Eat healthy so they eat healthy later on when they grow up. You might want to hold off on the red meats for a little while longer. Have to start small. I was feeding my kids beans and rice. They liked it then and they still do now that their older. good luck|`|BOzeeAN2aa	hummus is good for variety...chick peas, tofu...my son likes sandwich meats (turkey, chicken, ham). My son didn't really eat meat like hamburger till he was about 18 mos. I think it's something they have to come to terms with on their own.  At one point I had to sneak the meat into other things that I fed him...|`|sVn0Sy7taa	breakfast time my son just loves his toast, with jam or even just butter - sometimes he eats some bran for breaky, with me!!!<br>  <br>  my son LOVVVVVES jam sandwiches, they are his fav!<br>  tiny teddies, apples, biscuits, grapes & he absolutely LOVVVES noodles.. they are just some of what he eats for lunch<br>  <br>  at dinner time tho <br>  for dinner time tho he gets some vegies & marinated steak seems to be his favourite!  he loves it, also marinated pork!.   he likes taco mince as long as its not spicy!!  i also buy him frozen packaged fish portions which i cook up for him and he loves them too!|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My son is 18 months old, and he's been eating most of these things since 12 months or sooner.  He never really ate much baby food -- just went straight to table food.  He didn't have any teeth until 12 months, so some foods like steak and raw veggies are much easier to eat now that he has some front teeth and 3 out of 4 molars.<br>  <br>  Breakfast -- oatmeal, Cheerios, Rice Krispies, waffles, scrambled eggs (he likes his with cheese on them), pancakes<br>  <br>  Lunch -- leftovers from the night before, tortilla roll-ups with cream cheese/turkey in them, Gerber toddler ravioli or other meals, chicken nuggets, hot dog, Spaghetti O's, peanut butter sandwich (he just decided he liked sandwiches recently), yogurt, cheese<br>  <br>  Dinner -- spaghetti with ground beef in sauce, fish, chicken (cooked pretty much any way -- with BBQ sauce, with Italian dressing, dipped in ketchup, etc.), ham, turkey, lasagna, chicken fried rice, stir fry, quesadillas/fajitas/tacos, pork tenderloin, pizza, steak (although sometimes it's too tough), macaroni and cheese, other pastas, rice, applesauce, bread<br>  <br>  Fruits (served with a meal or as a snack) -- We haven't yet found a fruit he doesn't like.  He'll eat grapes, banana, apple slices (without peel), pear slices (with peel), blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, kiwi, grapefruit, oranges/clementines, watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapple chunks, etc.  Usually, we have fresh fruit, but he'll happily eat canned, too.  We just get the kind in "light syrup" (fruit juice) rather than the sugary heavy syrup.<br>  <br>  Veggies (served with a meal or as a snack) -- He loves raw veggies with Ranch dressing (carrots, celery, cucumber).  He also likes canned peas, corn, and green beans (the no salt kind).  He's not a big fan of most other veggies, but he'll usually eat a few bites -- baked/mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, refried beans, baked beans, kidney beans, lima beans, cooked carrots, etc.<br>  <br>  Honestly, just keep offering bites of what you're eating, and it won't be long until she's eating exactly what you are with every meal.
58G7ZAJpaa	Same boat.  I have the ligament pains when I sleep.  I roll over and try to get comfy, and my side screams "****" that hurts!  I'm up every night every 2 hours or so to pee, and then it takes me at LEAST 30 minutes to get back to sleep.  I have a 3 year old, that I'm taking care of single handedly right, and it just seems to be harder.  The only that I've noticed that DOES help, is soaking in the tub for 30 minutes or so before I go to bed.  I also lay on the couch and pop in a movie when possible.  Those are the ONLY things that seem to help.<br>  <br>  Sorry!  P.S. we share the due date!!<br>  Congrats and Good Luck!|`|57c8048751bb6dd1a49dc351791d9b29aa	I am in the same boat, especially if I push myself too hard.  I normally do dromedary droops.  Then, while on all fours, I have my husband rub my lower back.  Getting on all fours and resting with my head on the floor, belly between legs seems to pull some of the pressure she puts on me down and off my back.  I also kicked my husband out of the bed.  I surround myself with pillows and put a pillow between my legs to align my back while I sleep.  This helps out the back problem.<br>  <br>  As for the peeing, it just gets worse.  But trust me, the first night after you give birth, it is awesome to be able to sleep and not have to go to the bathroom!  It won't be much longer.|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Im not in the same boat.. YET.. but Im sure I will be when I get that far along. I was felt the same way with all of my little ones. Its hard to find a comfortable position that doesn't bother your back, but I found that using a body billow was very helpful. Putting the pillow between your legs can be helpful for your back, I know it worked for me. <br>  I seriously hope that you ll be able to sleep soon.|`|wT4MQkdzaa	Definitely in the same boat. I'm about 28.5 weeks and last night was the worst! Sharp pains...it hurts more to lie on my left side.

aEeCCHVlaa	My children are all grown now, but my favorite part about being a parent is the love they still show to and for me.  Along with the love comes all the things you mentioned.  Since my wife passed away, I am alone, but not lonely.  They email and call me every week and that cannot have a price put on it.|`|CFFuFof1aa	Everything, of course I love the hugs and kisses. I also love that she relies on me for everything, and that she loves me unconditionally. But, my absolute favorite thing to do is to watch her learn something new. I feel like she is so smart and I get so proud of her. I love watching her grow into this intelligent independent little girl.<br>  Congrats.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	All the little things.  Like having her come home from school and say she drew a picture and was thinking about me the whole time.  Or how at night when I hear her say her prayers and she says, "And please keep Mommy safe and keep her belly baby healthy".  Or when she comes up to me and kisses me for no reason and when I ask why she says, "Just because I love you silly."|`|AA10236694	the unconditional love my son and i share .|`|oP504BtFaa	My daughters are fourteen so hugs and kisses and definitely not as abundant as they used to be! Hugs, yes, kisses, pretty much only at night. Right now my favorite thing is watching them grow and learn and be mature young ladies. I love seeing them with their friends and peers and how they act and knowing that they are wonderful girls - and that I had at least some bearing on that.|`|C22jeMVhaa	Everything that everyone else said is definitely high on my list of favorite things. My kids are a little older. My favorite thing is them not knowing I'm watching them and seeing them make the right choices. Example: The other day my kids were at a park and a woman out walking dropped her bag. Everything spilled everywhere. My kids where the only ones that stopped playing to help her get her stuff. It was nothing major, but they helped a stranger in need and I am grateful to know that what we try to teach them is sinking in. It's awesome to me to watch them become responsible adults, even if they are just kids.
f0503b7c948aabdd21ad5f5ddaca7e86aa	She is scarred.  Please go easy on her.  I am terrified something is always going to happen to one of my kids.  It is a horrifying world out there and it sounds like your Mom is like me and is terrified that something might happen to you.  Ya'll are just going to have to work together taking baby steps.  I am telling you right now she will NEVER stop worrying about you.  She will eventually start to let go a little bit at a time though.|`|oK6sZ2fmaa	Your mom needs to start giving you a little space I agree, but she'll never let you go .We mom's are just like that. Is there a friend or close relative you could go to and ask them to talk to your mom with you and see if there's a way she could give you a little space so you can earn her trust? Good luck!|`|P5Iq6nufaa	You need to find a middle ground. Your mom is just worried about you; most parents worry about their children, especially at your age. Trust me, it will not stop because you turn some "magical" age of 18. You cannot stop her from worrying, and you should make her happy by calling when you get to your friend's house. You need to show her that you will be safe; have her go to the soccer game with you one time so she can see there are adults present who will look out for you. As for the grounding, is that the whole story? Are you sure you didn't do something to deserve to be grounded? Your mom has a side to the story too and we are only hearing yours. Talk to your mom. I bet she is not as unreasonable as you make her out to be.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	I think you should be happy that your mom cares and is not doped up and not worried about you at all. However, I understand where you're coming from. I think you should sit down and speak with her. Maybe you can reach a mutual agreement. Let her meet your friends and their parents FIRST so she can feel more comfortable about where you'll be.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	tell her exactly this - ask her if you have done anything to make her distrust you and your judgment. also that her smothering you  will inevitably push you away if she doesn't lighten up a little bit.|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	Your mom loves you but she is paranoia,well on the bright side 3 more years left.|`|yzakyjNKaa	sit down and talk to her tell her how you feel  and make a plan with her that both of you agree to  somthing that will help her  not to worry  about you  and make sure she knows that she raised a great kid and that you know how to protect your self    tell her that youll call to check in every 2 hrs or so (good excuse for a cell phone if you dont have one)|`|ppG2smDWaa	When you are 18 and she has to.

I took my three year old to the grocery store with me and i think it was early december so the hype was really up with santa clause coming and all that jazz. There was a man in the same aisle as us and he was definitely and old biker sort of guy but he had long grayish white hair and a long beard. My daughter had one of those mini carts so she was walking pretty much on her own. she walked up to the man and said "Hi santa! will you bring me a chair for christmas so i dont have to sit in my naughty spot all the time"  I was probably the color of santa's suit when i apologized to the man. but he thought it was pretty darn funny.|`|uLLQovSyaa	HA! I like to hear funny and embarrassing stories that kids say and do!Last year my oldest son was in kindergarten and they were allowed to leave at 1pm or could stay all day like the other kids.His teacher was pregnant and due in December.One day she had to leave from being sick or something and either that day (or later in the week) my sister picked him up at 1.They were in her car riding along or maybe parked and eating, anyways he said something about his teacher and not wanting to get what she had.My sister told him she wasn't sick she had a baby in her belly.he was like "no she don't!"And at some point he wanted to know how it got there and asked"did she eat it?"LOL!|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Haha well this isnt really funny but my mum was going out with her friend this morning and she had this dress on and she looked really nice, and my sister was like "nah mum you look hot" and im "like ignore her your just too too hot" and my sisters like "no your so hot that i can see the steam coming off you"<br>  my mums just like "ok girls, stop your scaring me"<br>  <br>  :)|`|89owZt6Haa	when my son was about 4 I asked him which of his favorite disney movies he wanted to watch.

She says ( pointing to my tummy) " mommy- baby in there?" I said " yep hon a babies in there" She hands me a duck and says " mommy- Baby need a duckie" I just smiled giggled. She was so serious when she said it. Then she tried to fit it in my belly button. I said she would have to wait till the baby was a little older. She sighed got down and said ok mommy. I still giggle think about it. She will be a great big sister.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thats a really cute story about your daughter. My aunt who is only 18 years old then me told me once that cooties were like brain lice and ate your brain, I was 5. I was terrified of cooties for a good 2-3 years. She still laughs about it.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	My husband came home today (Not my daughters Bio father) and my little one skips into the kitchen, pulls herself up on the chair and says to him "we need to talk".

c5AJGcYcaa	virgin or not, if you have sex unprotected you can get pregnant.|`|XpWjdPg2aa	No, she has the same risk as somebody who's not a virgin... you shouldn't have unprotected sex anyway though. Just use a condom or get on the pill... or both. It's not a very hard thing to do. Talk to Planned Parenthood, they'll keep things confidential.|`|fwro8soqaa	No. It's one of those rumors that float around high schools. Like you cant get pregnant if you have sex standing up, or in a hot tub.  It's been my experience that when it comes to sex, most high schoolers make things up if they don't know the answer.|`|AA10976444	Unprotected sex, virgin or not , has the same risk...pregnancy.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	No, but don't do it.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	For God's sake, Can we PLEASE get these children some sex ed!?!

Best thing to do is not do it until your ready, sex doesnt result in pregnancy all the time but dont dont risk it.|`|SzMH2na0aa	It depends on what time of month you have sex if you are ovulating or now that increase you chances of pregnancy.  It doesn't have anything to do with being a virgin or not.
8VlDuMFOaa	You and your boyfriend are both 20 right?<br>  You both made the decision to have unprotected sex and as a consequence you are now having a baby.<br>  I think honestly it is time to stop even worrying about what your dad is going to say and start thinking about how you and your partner are going to support and raise a child together...you are both adults, and maybe if you start showing some levels of maturity and make a plan, your father might be a little more accepting.<br>  He is the least of your worries ....bringing a baby into the world is massive.<br>  Does your boyfriend atleast have a job?<br>  At 20 you are both adults......I know it may sound harsh, but maybe you should have considered what can happen from unprotected sex - and now that you are pregnant, start taking responsibilites for your actions.<br>  Sit down and talk with him....WITH your boyfriend....yes he will be initially angry, but if you can prove to him that you are willing to do what ever it takes to raise a baby on your own, he may be a little more forgiving.<br>  <br>  btw...I should also say, that I am sure once the baby comes along, your dad may be more accepting than what you may think...he probably said those things about your cousin because he wanted to protect you and scare you somewhat.|`|Lmiu6oBHaa	Your 20 you should be free to do what you want!

You just need to sit down and have a conversation and tell him that you are sorry that you disappointed him, but what's done is done, and you are going to do what ever you have to do. Of course, he will be disappointed and angry at first, but he will come around I promise. It sounds like he loves you a lot.|`|AXEqOEloaa	Even tho you are still in high school you are old enough to get a job and handle your business, if you are as scared as you say then you should have taken precautions. This is an issue with a easy solution,you are grown now act like it.|`|LzJJn1m7aa	you will be ok i dont know any parent that stayed mad after the baby came. Dont have an abortion no matter what he says-you will resent him and your self the rest of your life if you do cuz its YOUR BABY! you can do it get a job now and you and your bf can support the baby 20 yrs old is fine to have one. just look forward to the new life you have inside your stomach, if all else failed you would still have your baby after all if you keep it.|`|nIE5Qtiqaa	How are you twenty years old and still in High School??? But, the fact that you are 20 years old should tell you something, YOU ARE AN ADULT who can make her own decisions. I'm only 18 and was terrified to tell my dad that I was pregnant in fear of what he would think of me after that. He had told me before to wait and have babies when I could support them and he would say things like "Please don't have any babies right now".When I told him, he wasn't bounce-off-the-walls happy about it, but his reaction was 10X better than I expected. EVeryone told me it would be, but that didn't matter because no one knew that my dad was "different" than everyone else, so I do feel your pain. I swear it won't be as bad as you think it will. When your parents find out, they will more than likely ask you a lot of questions rather than lecture you. If your dad does act mad and scream at you, don't take it personally. Truth is, he's just doing it because he cares about you and he knows the overwhelming responsibilitys that parenting can bring. (He is one, ya know) Sometimes men tend to act angry in order to cover up fear, and it's natural to fear for your child no matter how old they are when you find out news such as this.My advice is, get it over with. The sooner you tell him, the sooner you can drop that huge weight off your shoulders. Just sit down and explain to him that you have something to talk to him about  that's difficult to share. Tell him the news, give him time to react before you continue talking, and then answer any questions he may have. Good luck!!!|`|txv7TIgiaa	i got pregnant at 17 my mom was an alcoholic and she flipped out and kicked me out so me and my bf got are own place and are raising our baby girl well she is 15 months you are a n adult get a job and get your own place w/ your bf...your dad will forgive you and love his grandchild when he or she arrives...finish school good luck i think you can make it fine...|`|5ZNBXW8Saa	you think you have got it rought sorry.

npBp2TkPaa	well if she won't listen to you about it she obviously isnt that great of a friend anyway..<br>  and to go out with your ex boyfriend when you dont like the idea of it is just wrong<br>  both of them are not good friends, you dont need them in your life.<br>  "the only people you need in your life are the ones who need you in thiers"|`|1s3nddaYaa	o goodness. one of my best friends said that my b.f is worthess and she would never date him, nor touch him with a 10 foot poll, cuz he cheated a lot and slept with random chicks and his attitude was horrible. well i got fed up and left. and they wound up sleeping together 3 times. i think a friend should not even think about dating a guy that you dated. a lot of girls are like that and that girls also slept with my b/f two cousins, and this other girl slept with  my b/f his two cousin and their friend. but if she does she isnt your friend.  girls are mostly drama anyways. you can find someone that respects you more. friend wise and b/f wise|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	He`s just trying to get at you, to make you jealous and wished you had stayed with him.  He possibly does not even fancy your friend.<br>  Explain this to her, and then SHE might not fancy him either.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Tell her how she's making you feel, not just that he's no good and most certainly, tell him to back off.  And I think you should let your best friend know that she's acting extremely immature if she's going to let a guy, who's not even worth your time and shouldn't be worth hers either, come between your friendship with her.That or you could let her do what she wants and see what happens when things go wrong.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Rise above the immaturity of  your ex B/F.If you and your best friend break up your friendship over a boy , both of you are very sad.. I have great respect for you telling him to take a hike when he asked for sex.. Boys will put the make on a snake when their testosterone kicks in..If I were you I would completely ignore and not answer any communication with him.. thats what he wants..Hopefully your friend will see through him.. If not she too will get a lesson in life called growing up..|`|SWsDa1iXaa	don't let your friendship be screwed over. be happy for her and when she cries to you on how he dumped her, you can say, i told you so.|`|EY0wnkh3aa	LOL at first I thought your name said Natural Dirty Edward!! But ya  mean you tried to convince your best friend what he was like but she wouldn't listen. If you keep trying to convince her that hes' not a good person she's going to continue to think it's because your jealous. She probably told your ex that she thinks your jealous and that's why he asked you on myspace. Just let her make her own mistakes. Ya it's hard because she's your friend and you want to protect her but she's not going to believe you on this one so let her go out with him and then she'll see what he's really like. As for him, he's a total pig. You're friend will end up seeing his true colors and dumping that douche. Just don't go between them and save yourself the drama. Good luck :-)|`|rag4oABQaa	Well, if he broke up with you because you wouldn't have sex with you, he's probably trying to make you come back and do whatever he wants with him. As for the friend, I would try and get some proof that he's intentionally trying to be hurtful. The guy sounds like all he wants is to get laid, not to have a meaningful relationship.|`|Gbcp7hDIaa	He's obviously trying to make you jealous. If your friend won't listen to you, then you're gonna have to just let her do what she wants. Maybe get some other friends to voice their opinions to her first? She's probably flattered by the fact that he likes her, but a good friend normally won't go for another friend's leftovers (:<br>  <br>  Ox.|`|tu1m1dkoaa	I would just let it go with her if she won't trust you on anything. Expecially if your trying to look out for and help her make the right choices. And he probably is just trying to make you jealous because he knows that you to are best friends and maybe just wants to know if you really liked him or not.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Let her make her own mistakes. You warned her, now let her do what she wants. And stop trying contacting your ex, he's just going to make you out to be a psycho ex-girlfriend.<br>  Let her know that you are only worried about her, but you will support whatever choice she makes.<br>  Then be there for her when it ends.|`|NYJgiVxraa	hes a jerk. hes just another i want sex-aninmal and thats it on the face of the earth. tell the jerk that uve moved on with ur own life, and ur not worth his time whatsoever. and then tell ur friend that u r the one that dated him, u had the experiences with him, she needs to listen to ur honesty about him because you do not want the same things to happen to her. belive me, some people repeatedly make mistakes if they are not getting fired at about it. if she rejects him for dating, then he can learn a lesson and take a hint at the butthole he is.|`|11mJ0RHhaa	If she thinks your just being a jerk then shes not a true friend, if i were you i would just continue to tell her hes no good but if that dosnt work out just dont talk to her for a bit and then she will eventually know you were telling the truth about the guy.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S that guy sounds like a douche|`|FNb7a2kMaa	It does kinda sound he is trying to make you jelous, but he might actually like your friend.<br>  <br>  Too be honest i would stay out of it, if he is as bad as you say he is then she will learn for herself.<br>  <br>  Just try and stay friends coz if it all goes pear shaped she will need her pal<br>  <br>  x|`|JkDzvcqKaa	this is nearly the same situation my friend was in<br>  <br>  just try and talk to ur friend or get som1 else to talk to her that she trusts!!!<br>  <br>  if she doesn't listen then ther is nothing u can do but sit back and watch. but if he screws her with then all u can do is do nothing or just to be ther to help ur friend even tho she didnt listen
PBI3tCKaaa	Yes it did.  Sweetheart, no offense but through your questions you can worry a lot over things that could be explained in the book what to expect when your expecting.  I really think you should pick up a copy.

We are expecting her 6th (4th top tooth) in any time in the next couple weeks since we can see it coming in. <br>  <br>  She's only 8 months old lol. 5 teeth is crazy. But don't get too excited.

5ujzs0k3aa	tiny sips of pedialyte, a bite here and there of a cracker, sipd of ginger ale will help his tummy but mostly after he starts keeping some things down.  Pedialyte pops are wonderful as well.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Just little sips of pedialyte or gatorade. You could also do some 7 Up or Sprite.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	lukewarm fluids -1 Tsp every 15 minutes till he can keep them in his belly and increase the amount slowly.  avoid foods, let him rest, wash hands well, and increase his probiotic intake (try the kind that dissolves in water).  follow up with the pediatrician.|`|vk3CsYJ9aa	if you can get a hold of some mint and chamomile, sleepytime tea, or sometimes sucking on soft peppermint sticks can help, as well as candied ginger root. Also catnip brewed as a tea and add a little to the pedilyte will help to calm the tummy and will not harm him. if he can kep that down after a while you can try dry toast. (you can add the other teas to the pedilyte or just let him drink them warm like warm milk .|`|jlSzYpZSaa	Try small, like a couple of teaspoons of water if he hasn't thrown up in 30 minutes. He keeps that down after 15 minutes give him a little more. Work on keeping fluids down first. If he keeps the water down for an hour, then give him small amounts of pedialyte in 15 minute intervals. If he's doing okay with the pedialyte after a half hour give him a saltine cracker. See if he holds that down and then give him another. Crackers, water and pedialyte stay down, try some jello. All that stays down, give him bland foods. Nothing acidic that will upset his belly. Applesauce, toast, Popsicles, juice, flat ginger ail or flat sprite or 7-up. Stay away from dairy products until he's feeling better, as they can curdle in his belly and make him throw up again.<br>  <br>  If he throws up again, start the process over.<br>  <br>  Too much fluids and/or food is too much for an upset belly. Keep the amounts small otherwise he'll throw up again.
DuLhv7Ajaa	Because people that choose to be morally bankrupt want others to approve of their bad decisions. And if you call them out for being morally bankrupt they want to make you the bad guy.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	I just think the term bastard sounds awful to begin with.<br>  <br>  I know the meaning behind it, but it has taken on a negative attachment, regardless of what its original meaning was.<br>  <br>  I don't think the use of the word 'bastard', is appropriate in most situations, it may mean one thing, but is construed as another.<br>  It is not clever or witty, it is offensive.|`|MOsStEbqaa	The term bastard is just offensive in its self. its even harder for women who are with the baby's father and they are in a great relationship. I'm not married and we don't plan on getting married before the baby is born and i know it will hurt when people we say that just because i know that my baby has two loving parents who will be with it all the time.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	because of people's conception of the word.<br>  the denotation of the word is the 'child born out of wedlock' definition. however, the connotation of the word now is rude, derogatory and offensive. <br>  words dont change their original meanings but new meanings get added to the words every year. language changes.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Because it sounds rude. I would get angry if someone was to call my child that in my presence, I don't care technically if she/he is supposely a bastard base on a dictionary. Being engaged and 32wks pregnant, getting married before the baby is born is least of my worries.|`|IOp3knBjaa	I'm sorry, are you pregnant? This may be a legitimate question, but is being asked in the wrong category. My children do not fall under that description however I still think its rude. It is said to be rude in my opinion. There's no reason to call a child that no matter what circumstances it was born into. I think anyone that would refer to a child as a bastard should grow up. Maybe just my opinion though....|`|T48smu01aa	Cause most of our terms now a days have changed kind of like a "***" is a cigarette but if you were to say it someone might get offended b/c your calling them a ***. Our like your so "gay" as in happy it has now changed to you are so "gay" as in you like other girls or guys....It might sound stupid the way I worded everything but i just typed what I thought haha hopefully it makes sense :).....And Bastard now a days is just a hurtful nameinsteadd of a child out of wedlock.
LUg9dgb5aa	Not all teens are like that, we know. [:<br>  Your lucky your school is not like that,<br>  my school is so bad. People get high at lunch time, :/<br>  But, the reasons why people tend to stereotype us teens,<br>  is because well based on this new generation. It is the truth.<br>  Nowadays, SO MANY TEENS do drugs, and are getting pregnant.<br>  Yes, not all of them. In fact, ALOT of teens arent like that. But<br>  at the same time, there's more than enough who are like that.<br>  My school is normal, dont get me wrong. But it still has those<br>  teens that are out there getting high, giving blowjobs, and crap.<br>  The best way to just forget about those stereotypes, is prove them WRONG. Prove to them people, you arent like that. Ignore them, and live your life the way NORMAL teens should be. I really understand you, though. Stereotypes are just wrong. Good luck, :]|`|hUYaaXBvaa	people of every age group are stereotyped<br>  thats because some stereotypes are based on facts, and people cant look beyond those boxes<br>  as a teen i remember my friends and i being stalked by creepy security guards at a museum as one annoying thing<br>  some stores only let a few teens in at a time too<br>  and also, particularly older people, think teens are loud, wild, irresponsible and annoying<br>  but then again we stereoptype those older people s being curmudgeons<br>  ages will always be stereotyped as long as a smattering of people fulfill those expectations|`|VuGMOf4Caa	Yeah i think its funny, but most teenagers are ruining it for others. <br>  <br>  Even yahoo answers is stereotyping us, look where the Adolescent section is.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	yes.<br>  <br>  i mostly hate how i can't go into a store with more than 1 friend without being stalked the whole time by the security guard.<br>  <br>  it really, really pisses me off.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	No, I think it's funny.<br>  <br>  Obviously they're all just jealous of my youth and energy. ;P<br>  <br>  But seriously, no because I know I'm not a bad kid and it surprises people when they hear about my accomplishments and it kind of spits their accusations back into their face.<br>  <br>  And I think any faults of our generation can be blamed on the previous generations.|`|LklBuVAXaa	I'm not a teen just making an observation.  Teens do the same thing to adults all the time.  Teens think adults are clueless and have nothing to offer.  That's why they ask questions on yahoo answers instead of asking their own parents.<br>  <br>  All teens think parents are "over protective".  When in fact...its just that we've been down that road before and are offering "real" world experience on a topic.<br>  <br>  Trust me...when you become a parent you will be telling some teen the same thing that person told you.  Mark my words....<br>  <br>  So it doesn't bother me.  Opinions are like A_s_s_holes.  Everyone has one.|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Omg I know!!!! I'm only a freshman in High School and I haven't done any of those things ever. I mean I know a lot of people who have done both but whatever that's their problem. I hate when my older siblings make mistakes and my parents are all like well you'll probably do the same so blah blah blah! and The same thing at school. God I hate that.|`|04F4149yaa	My parents think that because teen girls my age have sex with older boys that I am as well...I think it's wrong to have sex before the age of 16, so they are just plain ignorant.<br>  <br>  Drugs make you stupid...I'm too smart for them.|`|quYp2Ajtaa	well our generation is pretty screwed up. Trust me, you may not see it, but there is A LOT of bad stuff out there. I had no idea until I got older, and it was right in front of me! They just want to protect you.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	I agree so much.

I'm 17, a virgin, and staying that way. Never once have I tried alcohol or drugs or any kind, except from doctor-prescribed medication. I'm very proud of myself on not being a s-l-u-t, idiot, moron, or immature little bee-otch.<br>  <br>  I work with kids all the time, I babysit, and I love taking care of my 7-year-old niece, Mia. I have a wonderful family. I have friends who aren't involved in any of that crap.<br>  <br>  But, the truth is, too many girls my age ARE doing these horrid things. Half of them don't even know what birth control is, let alone knowing that condoms are cheap, or how to put one on. (Condoms, with perfect use, have 2% failure rate. With TYPICAL use, there's almost a 20% chance of failure. I doubt many teens can put on a condom perfectly.) <br>  <br>  There's a girl on here (the name won't be disclosed, but I'm thinking she's a troll.) who's 14, pregnant, smokes pot, drinks alcohol, goes clubbing, and her mother is also pregnant with twins at the same time. She claims to have perfect grades, lots of money, and a loving boyfriend. Yeah, sure. I've pretty much labeled her as "Troll of the Century". Either that, or, "Biggest Moron on Earth, Content on Ruining her Child's Life." <br>  <br>  I just hate that, because of my idiotic peers, I automatically get labeled as "one of those teens".<br>  ~Emily-Maria|`|RLtzqQB9aa	you obviously go to an imaginary extremely posh private school on a dessert island if your school has no drugs or sex or anything :)<br>  <br>  or your just a very ignorant little person :)|`|sKTmxnx1aa	Yes!  I'm thirteen, and when I turned thirteen everyone was like 'oh, so now are you going to start doing bad things with guys?'  I was like um no!  Just because some teenagers have sex and do drugs does not mean I'm going to!  I care about my life!  Or when people ask me how old I am when I'm out with my Mom, and I say thirteen, they are always like 'oh, I feel bad for you' to my Mom.  Like, just because I'm a teenager does not mean that I'm going to trash my life!|`|nwZ1ZtRbaa	Yes, it bothers me. What bothers me more is when people act like our generation is the worst. I mean come on, like none of the teens/kids from past generations were doing bad things. Every generation has their bad apples. I am 17(almost 18) and I have never done drugs or had sex, so of course it would bother me if someone thought I was doing those things just because of my age group/generation.|`|nXktcA5Yaa	Yeah it bothers me a lot because everyone thinks that when I'm out of the house, they say I smoke, drink and do irresponsible things, when in truth I just visit the library most of the time. It's pretty annoying because when I say I don't do these things they say I'm not cool. What the hell does being cool have to do with irresponsible things!?|`|28QPS6V9aa	All people are stereotyped for their age, not just teens. Get used to it. When you're 21 you'll be stereotyped as always partying and drinking and the stereotyping doesn't stop there. Such is life. Just ignore it. If you're not doing those things then it doesn't matter. You know you're doing the right thing and that's all that matters.|`|wubrSdheaa	yes it does alot because me myself am a very girly person so that comes out as a prep who only cares about breaking a nail<br>  <br>  people dont want to be my friend cause they think im very stuck up...<br>  im just any other teen that wants friends amd just cause the way i look doesnt determine my personality i kno that didnt answer your question but i needed to get that out|`|gFViQVViaa	Being stereotyped is awesome especially when the manager of a store has a talk with you about shoplifting as you walk around looking for something to buy as in pay for, or when people say your friends are trouble just because of how they look and don't like them for that reason. IDIOTS stereotypers suck!!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	no one has ever stereotyped me that way but once & it was my uncle saysing he thought i was on drugs because i was screaming at him when he was arguing with my aunt but yet he is a sexual assulter.. <br>  i was upset they were fighting & have never dont anything but that really is the only thing anyone has said about me that i know of|`|AXkuxtzcaa	Yes I hate that. I am 17 and i get stereotyped all the time. I hate stereotypes all together; the whole idea of categorizing people is absurd, and yet we always do it. The fact that I have been on this earth for 17 years says nothing about the person that I am. It is annoying but we just have to ignore it I guess.|`|5UEugyzvaa	Yeah i hate when ppl judge me before they meet me. i DONT do anything like that, not that anybody says i do. but we have this big dork at my school EVERYONE says really mean stuff about him, i feel so sry for him.|`|cc4d599aa91088b8c88ae90414266222aa	yes!!! it drives me crazy. people seem to think that teens don't have brains and aren't capable of making good decisions. just because you see stupid teens around the streets and in movies/on tv does not mean we are all like that<br>  <br>  (im 15)|`|rag4oABQaa	I feel the same way. The people who stereotype the teenagers never once remember that lots of them were branded as crack-head, druggie hippies. Nope, all they can see is this generation of 'hooligans'.|`|GzXDRRYLaa	Yes i would bother me, but its more of less they not sterio typing you its the generation there sterio typing.|`|aRCKguzDaa	it bothers me soooooooo much.|`|zLoIkjoJaa	yes it is really gay|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	It did when I was a teen.|`|0WKkXIyKaa	yes it does. <br>  <br>  perhaps it's being in a group in a shop, and you get shifty eyes from the clerk because they think you're going to steal.<br>  <br>  And maybe it's not like that at your school, and it isn't at mine either, but in other places, it is like that, so it is a stereotype, only because those "type" of people do exsist.
2HETgiwgaa	Yes the nausea, fatigue, backache and feeling emotional all can be.  You may have tested too early.  Have you had your period yet, and if so, was it normal for you?  If your period is late, missed, or unusual for you there's are good chance you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Get yourself a multi-pack test if you think you are pregnant (so you'll have a spare test if you get another negative and want to try testing again in a few days), and make sure you use first morning urine which will have the highest level of hCG.  If you did test too early and you are pregnant, the hCG levels will be much higher now (doubling every 48 - 72 hours) and the chances of a false negative will be lower.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)
cPtuDMFYaa	All you can do is not think the worst or her and stick up for her. Is she is still going to school everyday i'm guessing people would bully her or something. You can't do anything but be nice. My friend got pregnant at 12, and I was 11. All I could do was just forget about it. It sounds weird I know but she prefered to just carry on as normal, she didn't want it to change her life/friendship with people.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Just be there for her, thats all you can really do. And can I say I am really proud of her for not aborting. Thats a very good decision, and adult decision. I hope her parents know about it though.|`|txv7TIgiaa	try to get her to seek counseling because you can't handle this alone, she will need more help...|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Be a close friend, listen to her, she's going to need a shoulder.|`|nlteggWIaa	just be there for her , that's all you can do

You and your friend need to know that open adoption is NOT legally enforceable in the U.S.  <br>  <br>  If one of my daughters had been raped, I would have supported their decision to either terminate the pregnancy or raise the child, but I since I was adopted, I would not support adoption, as I know the kind of pain that can give a child.  <br>   <br>  My daughters would never surrender a child, because they have lived with the trauma from adoption. It doesn't end with the adoptee, it runs generations deep.|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	I feel sure someone has already mentioned adoption to her.  Since she's 14, she's probably getting plenty of input about what others think she should do.  Just be a friend to her whatever she decides--don't try to influence her.  This decision is forever, and if she ever regrets what she does, you'd hate for there to be hard feelings between you about it.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	Assuming you want to HELP her, refer her to this page: <a href="http://www.girlmom.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.girlmom.com/</a> and offer your unconditional support for whatever choice she makes.  Why put her and her child through a lifetime of trauma because you just don't like the idea of her being a young mom?  She needs to be empowered and supported right now, not cut down and judged.  You COULD be just the friend she needs right now...or you could be tremendously hurtful.  Your choice.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	She won't be 14 forever.... I had a friend who was 12 and never regreted keeping her son.... she actually never considered adoption.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Her baby, her body, her choice and you should keep your opinions to yourself.  Try being supportive instead and find out what help she is entitled to so she can raise her child as the worst thing you or anybody else can do is coerce her into surrendering.  Trust when I say it is wrong to try and sway her into adoption- if she decides on that option at a later date then it should be entirely her choice not yours.  I know from experience how much adoption affected my life and my son's - he had a good upbringing but we are both damaged by his adoption.|`|Alyvp37Maa	Dear Kat,<br>  <br>  Honestly, its not your place to suggest adoption.  Although she is very young, it is her body, her baby, her life, and her decision.  You can be a good friend and support her with the decision she has made.  That is the kind of friend she needs.  Its not fair that she was raped and now pregnant.  Life is NOT fair.  It sounds like she is handling things fine.  You might actually suggest rape counseling or support groups but please don't pass judgment on her or her decisions.<br>  <br>  I wish her the best of luck.|`|zs1C1G1waa	Hi Kat,<br>  <br>  Your friend sure sounds like she needs a lot of support right now.  Fourteen IS young, but she doesn't have to place her child for adoption, and she won't be 14 forever.  It will be hard, but with her parents' support (hopefully) and good friends like you to help her, she and her baby will be fine.  Children grow up all the time in single parent families with grandparents, close friends, and relatives helping out.  I'm sure she's aware that adoption exists.  If she isn't looking into it, she must not want to do it, and that hopefully means her family will help her out.  So, I wouldn't suggest it to her.|`|UViJ899Daa	you can't tell her what to do but what you can do as a friend is be there for her and support her whatever her decision is. you can also help her by looking up some counselling or groups that tackles those kind of situations.|`|AA12127693	It's her decision.  You should not coerce someone into making this type of decision - sorry - but it's not up to you.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Don't bring up adoption.  If you are her friend, you will support her decision and not try to sway her one way or another.<br>  <br>  If she is 14, trust me, someone has already brought it up.  <br>  <br>  If she wants to keep it, help support her decision.  It is the bravest one she could make.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Are you adopted?  Do you know what adoption does to a mother and child?  Do you understand that it would further damage her?  If she chooses to make the best of a bad situation, I admire her very much.  If it were me, I would have had an abortion straight away. <br>  <br>  ETA:  Open adoption isn't enforcable.  The adoptive parents can move across the world without telling her.  Like another poster said, she isn't going to be 14 forever.  Even if her family doesn't support her, there are people in this world who will.  She doesn't have to give up this baby.  You should really listen to your friend and try to understand that she is trying to do the right thing.  The right thing for her.  That is what she needs.  She's been through enough without a judgemental friend coming along and trying to sway her in a direction that she doesn't want to go.  I still commend her for her decision of keeping her baby.
LSkeAPBIaa	My family is close friends with another family that have two moms. They have two children from sperm banks|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I do know children who are in this situation however they are all fairly young 5 and under so I wouldnt know how to tell you about how they feel.<br>  I can tell you though that the children are growing up healthy and loved and are thriving. <br>  Now in two of the cases I know the children's parents are gay so it's a different situation. The other one is a single woman whose bio clock was ticking and got pregnant thru sperm donor, she has now 3 yr old  boy and girl twins and they're doing fantastic.  <br>  I dont think the children if raised in a loving environment would frown upon their mom.

SIDS is the leading cause of death for infants in developed countries, and yet the causes are not fully understood. Past studies have linked breastfeeding with SIDS prevention, and this research shows that infants who are formula fed are twice as likely to die of SIDS than breastfed infants"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mamapundit.com/2009/03/new-research-lack-of-breastfeeding-doubles-risk-for-sids/" rel="nofollow">http://mamapundit.com/2009/03/new-resear...</a><br>  <br>  "...routine formula feeding -- even when done properly by parents -- is itself a contributor to overall rates of infant morbidity and mortality in the United States. This is because -- despite what manufacturers' advertising would have parents believe -- today's commercial infant formulas, while a marked improvement over the homemade concoctions of years past, still represent a flawed and highly inferior imitation of our own, species-specific milk.<br>  <br>  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics' most recent member survey, a majority of baby doctors see slightly more formula-fed babies than breast-fed babies admitted to the hospital for instances of malnutrition and failure to thrive. But this represents only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the differences in rates of morbidity and mortality between formula-fed and breast-fed infants in this country. When the overall health of formula-fed infants in the U.S. is compared to that of breast-fed infants -- even after controlling for variables such as parents' socioeconomic backgrounds -- it becomes clear that formula-fed babies are sicker, sick more often, and are more likely to die in infancy or childhood. However, parents often lack access to this information, and in fact, are often the recipients of misinformation, thus denied the ability to make truly informed choices regarding how they will feed their babies. Although the phrase "breast-feeding is best" is tossed around so liberally as to have been rendered almost meaningless, many Americans are under the mistaken impression that today's commercial infant formulas are nearly identical to human milk. And because of this, parents who routinely approach other important infant health and safety issues in a thoughtful, deliberate way are largely unaware that in epidemiological terms, the decision to formula-feed when breast-feeding is an option places their child at demonstrably higher risk for a wide variety of ailments.<br>  <br>  "Parents are not adequately informed regarding the real risks of artificial milks [infant formula]," says Nancy Wight, MD, FAAP, IBCLC, and a neonatologist at Children's Hospital in San Diego."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/1999/07/19/formula/" rel="nofollow">http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/1999/07...</a>|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no offense but this is a bad question to ask here because a lot of people are going to get on your case about it. of course we all know that breast is best however about the only two cons i can think of with formula is that it can be expensive and that it isn't as good as breast milk. the pros with formula was that i didn't have to breastfeed everywhere i went with my daughter because all i had to do was get out a bottle, my husband was able to help, she was just as healthy if not more so on formula, it's easy to make, easy to keep and baby's tend to take better to a bottle rather then learning how to take from a breast. but that was my case.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	First of all, I am going to duck from all of the negative comments that are going to be thrown around!<br>  <br>  Second of all, that is completely your choice, and I respect you for it.<br>  <br>  PRO'S- You know how much your baby is eating. <br>            - Others can participate in feeding the children, which I must say with twins, could really benefit you, especially if you are feeling Post natal.<br>            <br>  CON'S-It can get expensive for you<br>           -Formula is a little tougher for babies to digest, which may result in a bit of gastrointestinal trouble, such as reflux, posetting etc.<br>  <br>  I'm all for a woman to choose what they feed they're child, look at me, I have no breasts, am recovering from cancer, but that still does not stop some people from judging!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Hmm..some pros... unlike breast milk, the taste and quality of formula remains consistent and is not dependent on the mother's dietary choices. Mothers who breastfeed often have to limit their intake on certain foods, since some things can have a negative effect on her milk. The formula digests more slowly than breastmilk therefore formula fed babies remain satisfied longer. <br>  <br>  Some cons would be the cost. Formula itself, can be quite costly.. but formula fed babies need a few additional supplies. Bottles, nipples, bottle sterilizers, sterilized water, bottle cleaning brushes ETC.  The nutritional quality of formula is alright, but cannot compare to breastmilk which provides antibodies to help prevent infections and illness. That is probably the biggest disadvantage of formula.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped :o)|`|sw2R5A9iaa	instead of stressing -just do what is comfortable for you and your family.|`|AA12243380	Well, I formula fed my twins too and the pros in that instance was that like you said, my husband could help, it was less taxing on my body than breastfeeding twins would have been.<br>  <br>  The cons to it was the expense!  Formula feeding is expensive in general but when you double it that makes it even worse.  Another con was preparing the bottles, washing them, etc.  It was a big pain compared to breastfeeding.  I am breastfeeding a baby now and it's nice to have it be free and it's nicer not having to clean bottles.  lol<br>  <br>  As for health, my twins are healthy but they did get colostrum and breastmilk for 3 weeks so maybe I gave them an immunity boost?  I would encourage you to try to breastfeed them at least for a couple of weeks.  I did and I don't regret it at all.  :-)  You don't have to stick with it or even try but that colostrum is really good for them.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, by the way!|`|TWCskV2aaa	Like everyone said the cons are the cost! I use a store brand and it is EXACTLY the same as the name brands...it is even recommended by my doc and it is the only formula that didn't constipate my daughter. Here is the cost comparison <br>   <br>  Similac: Around 26.00 large can<br>  Walmart parents choice: 13.67 large can<br>  AND walmart will send you a 3.00 coupon once a month if you sign up monthly through email or phone.<br>  Congrats, good luck with the birth, and good for you for making the decision that works best for your family!!|`|VCCKfT3taa	The only strong CON that I can think of is price (up to 150 dollars a month in my state!), and the general disgusting looks and wagging fingers and nagging lectures from advocates of BFing when you let them know what you're doing. <br>  <br>  Srsly, some people will make you feel like a lazy, under motivated, impatient, selfish, all around bad mother for either giving up or not trying to breast feed. <br>  <br>  Gosh.|`|dPHUbKbmaa	You can pump your own breastmilk and put it in a bottle if you want your husband to participate in feeding.
AZSIoSNoaa	My best answer would to be either go to a doc, er, ect. or just wait it out and see. It could be implantation bleeding. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|CFFuFof1aa	I would go to the doctor and have them check the levels of HCG in your blood. They will probably make you come back in 48 hours (if you are pregnant) to see if the HCG levels have doubled. If they haven't doubled, then you would be pregnant and the bleeding would be normal. A lot of women have light periods there first month or so being pregnant. It definitely sounds like you are pregnant, but the blood test will be the only way to be 100% sure. I doubt its implantation bleeding because that is normally just spotting and wouldn't take up your whole pad. You might possible be having a miscarriage too.(I have had two recently, one in Oct 2008 and one in Feb 09) I pray that you aren't having a miscarriage, but the only way to tell is a blood test.Good luck, hun.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	it totally sounds like your pregnant. It took me two negatives before i got my positive. I just tested too early. Implantation bleeding is normal and happens in about half of pregnancies. very early on. As long as it's not bright red, heavy bleeding, it doesn't sound like a miscarriage. You need to make an appointment and get seen by a doctor. they will do a blood test to confirm a pregnancy.|`|v0DuLwLDaa	its called spotting =]|`|Fr9BBqCWaa	go to the nearest clinic (no not an abortion clinic) and get checked for free or next to nothing. parents don't have to be involved. you could have had a misscarrage (that they now call "spontanious abortion" for some reason. the almost exact thing happened to me.  it is important to see the md so your hormone levels can be checked.  they told me that if the "pregnant" hormones were not goiing away it could cause problems in the furure.|`|YIb23obFaa	that just happened to me this month i thought i was pregnant i was for sure our period came on same time and our ovulation was the same i was soooo sure i was pregnant and i started bleeding it was very light and stopped for like 10 mins and i had called my boyfriend and told him i thought it had been implantation but then its still going i am on my period. sometimes it tricks you but you might be since you said it was watery but mine was too. i had the bladder infection feeling and everything just take a test if you dont get any more blood.
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	It definitely sounds like you had some pregnancy symptoms. They could also be period symptoms as well though. Thats the hard part when it comes to figuring out if you are pregnant. The large amount of watery discharge is a huge sign of pregnancy. Many women say that they felt like that started their period, only to find a large amount of discharge. <br>  It does sound like implantation bleeding. That usually starts around the time that your period would start. The amount of bleeding can vary greatly, some people feel as though theyve had a full on period, while others only have a very small amount of bleeding. <br>  Bleeding early in pregnancy could be for a couple of reasons, implantation, sex and irritating the cervix.<br>  I would give it a couple of days, about 3 days after the spotting or bleeding is done. Buy a test and test with first morning urine. Good luck.
sK67bBy5aa	Normally if the baby doesn't drop then you have to have a c-section.|`|AA10976444	My first never dropped...they thought I'd be pushing for a while...I surprised them and pushed him out in 33 minutes.  No worries.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	i would think c-section, but i might be wrong.|`|98WKYtfwaa	If your baby doesn't drop by the time you're fully dialated and ready to push then an emergency c-section will be on the cards. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, some babies don't drop until the last minute.|`|3oSQQt6maa	Wish you the best, and good 'baby'luck!!!!!!!!!

The baby is getting ready to drop :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
r7q8LW7Aaa	Sounds like the real thing to me. Take a bath - it will either stop false labour or speed up real labour.<br>  You;ll know soon enough! <br>  Good luck.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think I would stay home as long as you feel comfortable. Now I know you said they were painful, but have you tried a hot shower or hot bath? Maybe walking around the house. Pacing always helped me. Massage maybe or trying to get on all fours and move around a bit. If your back hurts a lot, it could be back labor. <br>  <br>  You could go to the hospital, but they might just put you on a clock, so to speak, once you get there, if your contractions aren't regular. They may give you Pitocin to speed things up, or you might get an epidural and it could slow things down. <br>  <br>  It all depends on what you feel comfortable with - more interventions or less. You could always try hanging out in the lobby and walking for awhile and then checking in when you really feel things are starting to happen. Do you have a birthing ball? Sitting on one of those can help you dilate. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cdoLcoc0aa	False labor or B.H contractions are irregular and less painful than real labor. If the contractions you are feeling are five minutes apart you are quite possibly looking at the real thing. Go to the hospital and get checked out. Good luck.|`|3fa42e1d5f13f37e2ec069fe32521d2caa	I am a nurse, it sounds like real labor contractions to me. You need to go to the hospital.|`|SdVrwd6daa	i would go. if the contractions are that bad that you can't move then you should definately go.|`|xZWP2mqjaa	I think it's real labour. Phone the hospital and tell them that even though the contractions are not 5 minutes apart you are finding it difficult to cope with the pain. They'll probably tell you to come in. They did with me.<br>  And, not to make you feel worse, but it was probably the sweep you got yesterday thats done it! I did exactly the same as you and if I'd known how damn painful it was going to get I wouldn't have had it done. But....it's done now, so get on the phone and get yourself into hospital and start some pain relief.<br>  Good luck!!!!|`|ELcwi4XRaa	go to the hospital, if its not you can always go back home, you want to make sure the babys not under any pressure, and if you are in labor they can give you medication to speed the process up.
zHy0z7sAaa	You don't sound dumb.I actually had a yeast infection last week and I had only had 2 before in my life.I'm 29, just had a baby via c-section 5 months ago and I actually wondered if the yeast infection was from all that.They can actually be caused by hormonal surges and I guess everything is trying to get back to normal in our bodies so I can't rule that out.I think my yeast infection was caused by my period coming on. I highly doubt it was from the oral sex.As far as if having them more often now that we've had babies, I hope like hell we don't.lol.They suck so bad.But i've never heard of a woman having recurrent yeast infections from birth or c sections.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	take a bath with Selsun Blue and see your gyn.  increase your probiotic intake.|`|rjVALevtaa	The birth of a child doesn't cause yeast infections. Are you on birth control pills or have you recently been on antibiotics? Those are two medicines that can often cause yeast infections.<br>  <br>  And no, yeast infections aren't caused by oral sex. Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the vagina.|`|dW4DbkCLaa	I get yeast infections sometimes too and I had my daughter via C-section 7 months ago. I think it's because of hormones and also I am taking the pill so that could be it too. You should try taking acidophilus every day. It's a probiotic you can get at any grocery store and it helps alot. You can also take AZO Yeast which is also availble at any grocery store. I take both of these everyday and I haven't had a yeast infection is awhile.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	Yeast infections can be caused by throwing off the ph balance of your vagina. It is possible that the oral sex caused it if mouths and/or hands are not clean.  Be sure to have him wash up.<br>  <br>  I have also gotten yeast infections from antibiotics because they get rid of the good bacteria down there. <br>  <br>  There are medicines over the counter that can help you and if it's really bad, you can get a prescription from your doctor.<br>  <br>  I don't believe it's from your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|I6qfoJaiaa	A yeast infection isn't really an infection is just the ph getting out of balance down there. It's normal after child birth and while pregnant, hormone levels changing can effect moisture levels down there. Also sex, medicine, being sick can cause one. Wear cotton underwear, no thongs for a while, stay dry and clean and you can get an over the counter yeast treatment. Some women find a difference if they eat a yogurt a day.|`|AA11728165	It's totally common to get increased yeast infections any time there's a major change in your hormones. This means pregnancy, childbirth, going onto birth control, going off of birth control... So yes, it probably was caused by the fact that you just had a baby (c-section wouldn't have anything to do with it, just the fact that your hormones are adjusting to not being pregnant anymore). You shouldn't get them more often now, though. It's just part of the adjustment of your hormones, so once you adjust, that really won't be a factor anymore. I went on and off birth control pills several times and I got one every time I started birth control and one every time I ended it. But just one each time :) <br>  <br>  What everyone said about PH and antibiotics, etc. is totally true, too, but I would say that in your case, it's probably just a hormone adjustment thing. I've gotten one every time I've gone on antibiotics, by the way.

There's no need for anybody to be rude to anybody else for their personal choice. That includes you. As alike as we all are, we all have our differences. Some people do feel pain a bit more acutely than others. That doesn't mean they are weaker in the head.<br>  Go live in somebody else's skin for awhile. Maybe you'll see just how different things are in there than you are used to now.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Honestly I see the rudeness and judgmental comments coming from both sides of the spectrum here, which is absolutely ridiculous. Even your comment here is suggesting that people that opt for medication are weak-minded. That's a very personal decision for people and everyone has thought it through so people in general really should be more respectful of each other, unfortunately that's just not how things are sometimes.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Because they feel the need to critisize because the people who don't want to be doped up are being bad parents. This is my first child and I am planning to give birth natural. Nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  These people just get their kicks out of making nasty comments and never have fully grow up. Don't listen to them.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	I have honestly seen nothing of the sort, if anything, I have seen the situations reversed, and a lot of women getting catty at those you DID have an epidural.<br>  <br>  The reason why people would do such a thing, is quite simple.<br>  Many mothers view birth/parenting as a great big competition, and think that they're way is the only way.<br>  <br>  But, I do have to say, your answer is slightly disrespectful to those that DID have an epidural, while you should only be targeting those who have given you a hard time, not every epidural receiving person.<br>  <br>  You are basically being a hypocrite.<br>  You are calling every epidural receiver weak, and than is completly uncalled for, and you should feel ashamed.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	I  think all it is is just that a lot of times women that give birth without an epidural act like they are somehow better mothers or like the world should congratulate them or something. it doesnt really matter how you give birth, the point is that you are still giving life. also it gets irritating all the women who act like they would never ask for an epidural but are screaming for one when the pain really hits. it makes me want to say told you so. the bottom line is so what you gave birth without one, toughing out pain does not make you woman or mother of the year!|`|kdSuwt8paa	Go into an old cemetry and see how many women died in childbirth and how many babies died at birth.    The statistics have improved and although some of that is due to antibiotics some of it is also due to the doctor intervening when necessary.   The sensible thing is to hope for a natural birth - but to be ready to accept help for yourself and/or the baby if need be.   Saying God made us this way is all very well, but he also gave us an appendix and we sometimes have to have it removed!  You are disrespectful to the people who had an epidural so why do you feel that nobody should be disrespectful to you?|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Well, it's all personal choice and everyone has an opinion.  Some want epidurals, some don't.  Some feel the need to voice their opinions about others personal choices.  Personally, I think it's silly.  As for natural vs. epidural, it's all up to the person.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Amen sister! But at the same time, pain doesn't effect everyone the same. I am going natural (if I don't have to have c-section) but to each their own. My sisters are rude to me about not wanting drugs, saying "you will change your mind when you get in there" and "you are stupid to elect to have her without drugs". I just smile and go on, just ignore them. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	PAIN TOLERANCE - its a lot more complicated than you obviously know! it depends on your culture and your up bringing i know it sounds weird but its true!|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Im not sure of the posts you are speaking of. I am as far away from having a natural birth as you can get. Ive had 3 c sections and Ill have my 4th in July. <br>  I am not against anyone that wants to do it naturally. I say, if you can do that, all the power to you. <br>  However, I am also not against those that decide on having an epidural or other forms of pain medication. Any way that you decide to have your baby, is a very personal decision. Its no ones business but your own. We have to remember that as mom's, we have to decide what is best for us and our babies, we all have the best interest at heart, right?|`|xZWP2mqjaa	I think it has a lot to do with the whole "to posh to push" society today. Women want to prove they are 'all woman' by having babies, but don't see why they should go through the whole childbirth process. <br>  I'm pregnant with my 2nd and will not choose epidural this time - I didn't last time either - but that's my choice. I am not comfortable with the idea of having a needle inserted so close to my spine. That's not to say my birth was all natural. I still had painkillers (which wore off before the end and they wouldn't give me any more!)<br>  At the end of the day it comes down to personal choice. I don't think any worse of a woman who chose to have an epidural and I dont think any more highly of the woman who did it all natural and felt every single ounce of pain for 72 hours. Each to their own. We've all gone through it, we're all heroes!!|`|KTnXWo1Caa	I'm not against it, but I would prefer drugs.<br>  <br>  Reminds me of Knocked Up...when she insisted on a natural childbirth and then was like WTFFF in the middle of it. :)<br>  <br>  More power to you! I can't tolerate that kind of pain!|`|fMnzjULCaa	Actually I've noticed just the opposite. People usually seem to put down people that want to have an epidural. Kind of like what you are doing in your question. I am by no means weak in any way, however I am choosing to have an epidural b/c if it's going to make the pain more bearable, why not? Our bodies are meant to do a lot of things, but if science can aid in the comfort or pain relief of these things then I don't see a problem w/ it. Why do you feel like you have to make a big deal about having your baby natural? Are you bragging? Do you think it makes you a better person/mother than me? I don't know what somebody said to make you angry but I have never once seen somebody who had or is getting an epidural on here criticizing somebody who isn't. I have seen people be criticized for getting one though. & I also have seen people telling others to wait until the labor & see if they still want to do natural, but I don't think that's a major deal. In any event, when somebody tells me they did it naturally it doesn't change my opinion of them good or bad. People need to stop forcing their beliefs on others (no matter what the opinion is).|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I have nothing whatsoever against a woman wanting to give birth without anything for pain-  I had my second child with no pain meds, and I had my first with an epidural.   I will get an epidural again if I have time and I don't think that it makes me weak to take pain relief.  Does it make a cancer patient weak to ask for pain meds when they are dying?  No.
iE7k6Vzraa	It is so hard to bond with a baby in the NICU- especially the premiez because you don't have that freedom of being able to just grab them when they cry its is such an ordeal with all the wires and not very comfy for either of you.<br>  You can do it I know it seems very overwhelming but it soooo much easier at home. Hang in there and make the nurses help you and ask lots of questions.<br>  When my son was in the NICU I thought the same thing .Its gonna get a lot easier with each day trust me. Good luck.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	It sounds like you may be experiencing post partum depression along with the normal anxiety of caring for a preemie.  Most moms don't have to be talked into holding their baby most are jumping at the chance which makes me think you may have PPD.  See your doctor as soon as possible.  Be at the hospital as often as possible and help in the care of your little one.  While mine was in the NICU I fed him, changed his diaper, his clothes, gave him a bath at night, anything they would let me do, I did.  You can do this!  Work with them and you will feel comfortable by the time he comes home!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Hun it's natural to be scared when you first bring your baby home, especially if you have a tiny little preemie.  When I got my son home I walked through the door, sat him in his moses basket and thought "Right, where the hell do I go from here?!"<br>  <br>  It comes naturally to most of us, you'll be able to care for him, keep him safe and nurtured.  My sister's baby was a preemie, she was still tiny when she came home, I'm sure my sister was terrified but she coped amazingly, and so will you.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a great support system around you, don't expect too much of yourself at first, as long as you are there to love him and take care of him you and she will thrive.|`|AA11296044	Just keep going back and keep holding him and getting more and more comfrtable with him.  Ask the nurses a pile of questions, any thing which comes to you mind, I assure you they will be happy to answer anything to help you adjust to motherhood.<br>  <br>  Look around you area for groups of other moms with preemies to share your fears and thoughts.  You are not alone, having a baby is the most frighting, yet wonderful things on earth.   <br>  <br>  You can do it, you will do it and everything will be fine.<br>  Congratulations!|`|bMvAmMTaaa	sounds like post partum depression. you can do it, but it will just take some time. it is a new situation for you, and you probably wasn't expecting to feel this way. make sure when you do take him home, you have someone to help you if you feel it is getting too much.<br>  <br>  hope everything goes well for you, just take one step at a time. x|`|MGO1CEYSaa	I believe you're just overwhelmed with the whole experience, the whole fact that this is real, and you made it that far. He's your baby, and all yours, no one will ever hurt him. He depends on you now, you gave him life. Be strong for yourself and newborn.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	You're his mother!  You can do it!  Gather up all the help you can find and just get yourself ready.|`|yw7AeZn2aa	Visit the hospital a lot now while the nurses are there to help you and show you what to do- its like free baby care classes.  Tell the nurses how nervous/scared/overwhelmed you are and I KNOW they will find a way to help you feel more comfortable.  Its a great way to get used to it now while you have them to help you. <br>  <br>  You can do it!!! Make a list of what you are scared of/don't know how to do and give it to your sons nurse- they will help you!|`|0SHOXqb4aa	Give yourself a chance.  Even with a full term baby you would be emotionally a bit all over the place due to hormonal let down, which can carry on for some time, and you've been through the trauma of giving birth to a preemie.   Remember that your baby will not be allowed home until he is ready, so you have nothing to fear.  When he comes home, let everything else go for a few weeks and concentrate only on him, and then ease yourself back into the world..  Every day will see him a little bigger and soon he will reach milestones and all this will seem distant.  Enjoy your baby and congratulations.|`|VCCKfT3taa	Just remember the basics for now. Poo, food, cuddle, sleep. <br>  He'll mostly sleep for the first month, all day. You might not be able to sleep while he does (I found it impossible and spent the first 3 weeks working off of 2 hours of sleep a day) but just lay down and rest. <br>  <br>  Your hormones are letting down from the build up they experienced right before you gave birth; now that it's over you're literally "crashing". Give this a few days to run it's course.<br>  <br>  If  by the end of the week, you still feel sad or overwhelmed all the time, I want you to make an appt. with your gyn or regular doctor. Tell them how you're feeling and they might prescribe a mild antidepressant. That's what they did for me. I took Zoloft for the first 2 months, and then was able to take myself off of it. It helped me get through the beginning. <br>  <br>  Take lots of pictures as well! Even if you don't feel like it. You'll need them when he's 2 years old and you're tearing your hair out wondering how you'll get through his toddler years. You an look back on those adorable baby pictures and fall in love with him all over again.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I remember my mom telling me how afraid she was to take me home. <br>  She was afraid she was going to mess something, anything up...<br>  Then a nurse looked her the eyes and held her hand saying <br>  "You have never been a mom before, and she has never been a daughter before, She won't know if you mess up"<br>  Just relax you will be fine. You are going to be a great mom.|`|5saz2WV0aa	It is ok and totally normal.<br>  when i brought my son home i was crying all the time, and to be honest he really scared and intimidated me. <br>  i didn't feel like i was doing anything right and when he would wake up and start to cry i would feel a huge dread like here we go again will i be able to do it right this time?<br>  the first couple of weeks i was on automatic pilot. it was all very hazy and stressful but when u HAVE to do something, then u do it.  i didn't worry about even picking up the phone. if someone would come and visit my husband was instructed to send them away. i didn't check my mail NOTHING i couldn't deal with people or anything. i completely disconnected myself from the world. <br>  if that's what u need to do then do it. sleep as much as u can and don't worry about anything else. life will eventually go back to normal.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	The love you have for your baby will become stronger than your fear. Hold your baby and really look at him. Look into your baby's eyes, stroke his cheek. The more you hold your baby the stronger he will become and the less afraid you will feel. In no time he will be tearing through the house and breaking things LOL. When I was born I was 4 lbs and my mom cried all the time when she had to change my diaper. And now I'm perfectly healthy. You will both come through all right.|`|AA11600455	you will do fine. my daughter was full term and i was scared to hold her. now we are just fine. you will be fine. i believe in you|`|mHOoYLjwaa	It's okay.  :)  First off, let me tell you, you are COMPLETELY NORMAL.  Feeling like that does NOT make you a bad mom, or a bad person, or a freak.  You have an unbelievable amount of hormones hijacking your body right now.  You also have a preemie, and that's got to be unbelievably stressful.  I had a normal birth, with a healthy son that I was looking forward to, and you know what?  I felt like they handed me some stranger's baby when they gave him to me.  I felt terrible, but that's the truth.  He was just a baby.  I didn't feel any huge surge of love, or life-changing emotion, or even (I'm embarrassed to say) affection.  I just wanted to be left alone, and instead I had a needy infant who looked nothing like me, and I couldn't stop crying about how guilty I felt that I didn't want him, and that I didn't love him.<br>  <br>  So please believe me when I tell you that it's okay to feel that way.<br>  <br>  Here's my really big secret:  I felt that way for 3 MONTHS.  It took 3 months for me to fall in love with my son, And meanwhile, everyone else was going crazy about how wonderful he was, and wasn' t it great, and wasn' t it just the most incredible, wonderful, life-changing experience ever?!?!  And there I was, feeling guilty because I felt like I could just move to another state, and not miss him in the least.  Then one day it just clicked, and I'm sure it will be that way for you, too.<br>  <br>  So, don't feel guilty or bad.  You'll be just fine.  It took me some time, and it might take you some time, too.  What helped me the most was skin-on-skin... I would hold him against my stomach/chest (just a bra, no shirt) and have him be in just his diaper.  It made it feel more real to me, and calmed us both down.   Maybe it will help you too.  <br>  <br>  It probably doesn't help that you have tons of people staring at you while you're trying to bond with your kid, either.  You'll be fine. Just take it one day, one hour, one minute at a time, and you'll be just fine.
CdJtH0xdaa	It's not a bad idea. Go for it if you want to.|`|A3zAXntxaa	Um, I guess it's a pretty okay idea? Social effect, maybe that everyone will think you're a liar and won't believe you when you're ACTUALLY going out with someone. Pros, you'll fool people I'm sure.. Cons, unless you start having actual feelings for the dude, nothing except people think you're a liar.

Not to mention that you never know that if by acting more affectionately toward the other you might end up developing actual feelings. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's a good idea. Come up with something else, something funny and foolish but for the day of April Fools not starting before that. <br>  <br>  Additionally, consider all those around and those who may be affected by the idea of you two going out and how they would feel about it.|`|b0Z8c6wJaa	I think that would be funny.<br>  <br>  The pros are you can make a good prank out of it if you don't screw up. The cons are people might take you seriously.<br>  <br>  Other than that, cool.|`|4AH0mN1Aaa	I think you guys should start up a fight club.<br>  Pros: you'll be extremely popular and cool.<br>  Cons: Death is likely|`|4RTKq5t4aa	be careful do not let emotions over take the prank|`|rOfFOcwpaa	hahaha I love pranks, if it's something noone would expect go for it!|`|ne0EjucSaa	To make it moer believeable youd have to kiss!! so this way its more believeable|`|w1BC4paiaa	I did that one year- we actually did it because his bff <3d me, & my bff <3d him. We thought it might send them into each others arms or something. We were young. We both have a weird sense of humor & thought it was funny at the time but it made our BFFs pretty mad considering.<br>   They eventually got over it but everyone else thought it was funny.<br>    If people have asked if you were going out before the shock value of it wouldn't be that much. It worked for me because we were the LAST people anyone expected to be dating. <br>  <br>  To make it more known, instead of just doing facebook, youshould have him ask you out somewhere everyone will see! At lunch maybe? People's mouths dropped open when we did it, literally. If you don't think you'll get that effect, others might find the joke lame. If that works out well you might even "break up" loudly, & once again publicly.<br>  <br>  So my advice is totally do it, just as long as you two don't have anyone who REALLY likes you, & as long as you're sure people will be surprised. Haha.|`|z7PQ1xaVaa	it's not really a real prank. think of it this way, how will everyone react when you say "just kidding! we're not really dating!" if friends did that to me I'd be like "Oh really?" and get over it in less than a minute.
CdJtH0xdaa	That's really sad, and I'm sorry. If I were you, I'd have a little talk with them. Ask them why they're acting like this, because they have no right to be treating you like this. I can't actually believe your mom said to you, "I didn't want kids", and your dad said to you, "Nice choice for a slut". Honestly, they don't sound like very good parents to me. Honestly, I would talk to them about how you feel, because they're being rude and unreasonable. You need to express how you feel. Then, if they still continue to act as though they don't care about you, I'd consider cutting them out of your life.|`|z5olpY6gaa	Blow up at them.<br>  Being a good kid hasn't gotten their attention.<br>  <br>  Sit down and ask 'What's your problem?'<br>  That's what I would do anyways.<br>  <br>  On a normal day, they come home, and don't say anything. Meet them at the door and ask them if you can move out, because they don't care about you.<br>  That will get their attention.
gxdej2deaa	no i would not<br>  <br>  back when I was applying to college, I didn't apply to any out of state private universities because I didn't want to make my parents pay two or three hundred thousands dollars for my education (even though they were capable of doing so)<br>  <br>  i think it would be irresponsible to send your child to an institution that you cannot afford<br>  <br>  as for the child, they could argue that they are not getting as good of an education. I say that's bullsh*t...you can get just as good an education at a public university. Plus what is really important is how a student uses his/her time, not which university he/she goes to.|`|lzEuuseJaa	Private colleges tend to offer very good financial aid, so your question is very hard to answer. At Harvard, if the parents make $60,000 or less, the parents are not asked to contribute. $120,000 to $180,000, the parents pay 10% of their income -- a huge deal when the actual cost is $50,000+. Between $60,000 and $120,000, they pay less than 10% of their income. Very often private colleges end up costing less than public, because of the financial aid. And then there are student loans.<br>  <br>  I don't think (lottery?!) I'll have several hundred thousand set aside for college for my son (high school will be over $100,000, LA private school, ugh), and we likely won't qualify for any financial aid, but I'll send him, somehow. He's likely to go into a field where the cost of private college would make sense and raise his income so it would be worth it. Hopefully there will be some sort of merit-based aid available.  = )|`|AA11296044	Private school doesn't always have to break the bank,  we already do send the children to a private school, granted one which the tuition is very manageable only a couple hundred per child, per month.<br>  <br>  If my children were accepted into a school which was outside of the price range, however the institution was well accredited and a great opportunity I would find a way to make it happen.

I would pick up a second job and reevaluate my expenditures.<br>  <br>  If the school was worth it, they would go.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	As the daughter who is anticipating her acceptance status letter by March 25th to a private, Catholic, all women's school in Indiana... yes, I would send my child. I am very blessed that my parents both have secure jobs and are willing to pay for FOUR (not the five that I will need) years of my college education. The last year comes out of my pocket. <br>  <br>  There are scholarships, grants, loans, everything under the sun to help kids get into such schools. But if I ever have children, they will get four years out of my pocket and nothing more. :)<br>  <br>  Edited to add: I forgot to mention that I live in lower Alabama.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Well, it depends on what you mean by "can't afford."  Most people can't really afford private college at all.  You have to be quite wealthy to be able to afford private college for even one child.  <br>  <br>  I will do my best to send my child to the college of his choice.  There are loans available, and we have already started a 529 plan for him.|`|AA11104372	I will try to send my kids to the college of their choice, but if it isn't affordable, they will have to get jobs and loans.|`|VHHis05Naa	I'd save the best I could and if they insisted on a certain school, I'd rely on them to bust their humps to get financial aid.  If they want it that badly, they can help out.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	No, I attended a private school for a term and not only was it a terrible school but it was  $10,000/ term and I didn't get any financial aid. I took out loans and I will be paying them back for that one term. My kids will take what I can give them and if they don't want that they can earn their own money to buy whatever they want.
nGwbqpQCaa	nope, i am satisfied with my size ;)|`|LQ7rROMSaa	Yup, even though I already have big boobs, haha. My mom bought me them; I guess she didn't realize they make my knockers huge.

Cg4fWi3Baa	I can't pick. All the stages are great and all the stages have their challenges.|`|uP08b6K4aa	Every single scrummy year!!  When they get older, you look back to when they were babies and toddlers and think "My god where did the years go?!" and although it was hard work, you'd do it all over again if you could.<br>  <br>  I especially loved the 3-4 age though as they'd entered into education and were learning all sorts of things and bringing things home from school and nursery, so very proud of themselves even though the paintings resembled nothing!<br>  <br>  Would love to do it all again.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I loved every stage because they were learning new things with every stage that made me so proud to be there mom. My oldest daughter is 5 and I am loving this stage with her right now because she is old enough that she loves all the girlie things. We paint nails together and she puts on her fake make up while I do mine and we sit and talk while I do her hair.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Ah, I enjoyed all the stages! I guess I'm lovin' the one she's in now the most... (7 months), probably because she just started crawling!|`|AA11296044	I enjoy them in different ways with each passing year.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	The whole schaboodle!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My daughter just turned two and gosh its hard to pick but I loved when she was just a little baby. Looking at her and knowing that i help create such a amazing little being was pretty cool to me. Now at this age watching her learn something new every day is amazing to me. I think that the younger age because it was a very healing thing having her be born for my whole family ( moms side, we had lost my cousin 10 months before she was born) and in that she was so important to my step dad and he passed away when she was 7 months. I miss him every day but i know he would be so proud of her if he saw her now.|`|z03coR1Oaa	to do truthful all the ages are great i have three children eldest is 11 and i love that age because we have girlie day together and we can have some quite grown up chats. my middle one is 7 and is still at the age where he give me a kiss at the school gates and is very cuddle and not ashamed of me lol. then there's my youngest who's 3 and such a bundle of funny a proper little comedian and very affectionate. so you could pick good points with what ever age they are but then again i'm quite sure i could pick some bad points too but i'm on a high about my kids at the moment so i won't go in to that one.lol|`|bHfuVh6kaa	I love my son with all my heart and soul and always have and will- I can't say I didn't enjoy my son during any of those ages - we only had him from 18 mnths as we adopted him- but they were really tough times for all of us too- my son was diagnosed with autism - it was a real struggle sometimes we were just living minute to minute - but we got through it and did have some wonderful times too - and the bad memories do fade lol <br>  <br>  I have enjoyed my son more since he was six and things got easier - (I am sure he would say the same about us lol) and now he is 13 he is an absolute joy to be with - funny kind generous and happy - I really do love having him around - he is the best company and he is the light of our lives|`|COzmvtTdaa	god thats a hard one. my daughter is only 2 but it seems to keep getting better and better, although during her short life, whenever people have asked me her age and i've given it, they always say,, ahhhh thats the best age, whatever it has been.|`|i4I0cuudaa	I am a mum and a granny.  I enjoyed every stage with our children, all those you suggest plus the teenage stage.  they were great fun and brilliant company (still are)|`|NopTr18taa	I've enjoyed all my boys' stages. My oldest is 7 and my youngest is 3. Fun times fun times. :)|`|36Za71rEaa	my son has recently turned 5 and I can honestly say the "bestest" age was all of the above.|`|AA10943257	3-4
aDQgLEbuaa	In my class we had it for one day.  We had to have it the whole school day, and then we had to take it home over night.  We didn't work with anyone, we did it by ourselves.  It was so much fun though, I wish I could do it again.|`|yB5go5wbaa	are you talking about baby alive?  it's on all the time and you have to take care of it all the time.  we never got paired up with anyone, but your teacher might pair you up.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	In my class we didn't get paired up and we had the baby from Monday morning to Friday afternoon and it never turned off. That was years ago though..
dPmK83UYaa	What will the doctor do?<br>  If your baby is under 3 months old, your doctor will probably ask you to bring him in so he can be examined. She may tell you not to give your baby any fever-reducing medicine until after she has taken an accurate temperature reading.<br>  <br>  If your baby is 3 months or older and has no other symptoms that suggest a serious illness, your doctor may advise giving him children's acetaminophen (or ibuprofen, if your baby is at least 6 months old) to bring down the fever. If his temperature isn't lower within an hour, ask your doctor whether you should switch to a different medication — ibuprofen if you've been giving acetaminophen, for example.<br>  <br>  Unless your baby is less than 3 months old, your doctor will probably tell you that if your baby is reasonably alert, taking fluids, and has a temperature that you've been able to keep below 102 degrees F (38.9 degrees C) with the recommended dosage of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, you can wait 24 hours before bringing him in. Because fever is often the first symptom of an illness, a doctor may not find anything significant if your baby is examined too early.<br>  <br>  No matter how old your baby is, if he has symptoms that suggest a serious illness or infection, the doctor will instruct you to bring him in to be evaluated, either to her office (if you call during working hours) or to an emergency room.<br>  <br>  If fever is a defense against infection, is it really a good idea to try to bring it down?<br>  Since fever is part of the body's defense against bacteria and viruses, some researchers suggest that the body may fight infections more effectively when its temperature is elevated. (Bacteria and viruses prefer an environment that's around 98.6 degrees F, or 37 degrees C.) A fever also tells the body to make more white blood cells and antibodies to fight the infection.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if your baby's temperature is too high, he'll be too uncomfortable to eat, drink, or sleep, and that will make it harder for him to get better.<br>  <br>  If your little one's fever isn't affecting his behavior, you don't need to give him anything to lower it. Offer him plenty of breast milk or formula to prevent dehydration, and don't overdress him or bundle him up when he's sleeping.<br>  <br>  If your baby's body temperature is higher than normal because of extra clothes or a scorching day, help him cool down by taking off a few of his layers and letting him rest or play quietly in a cool spot.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	All you can do is give him some TLC. Comfort and rock him. What you may want to do it raise his mattress at one end so he is not flat on his back when he sleeps. I am not sure if he is rolling over yet and that but if not than raising the mattress might help him breathe more at night. Get a humidifer that you can add vicks into. They sell them at Wal-Mart. Plug that in his room so the room is full of vapour. Other than that just cuddle him and help him feel better. You'll have to monitor the fever. Most times a cold just has to run it's course. If he starts vomiting and that then I would take him to the hospital. My son had a bad cold and cough when he was just 2 months old and I did this all for him and he slept better with his head raised at night. I just put a phone book under one end of his mattress. Now your son is 5 months old and moving around alot more so it's up to you if you want to do that. Best of luck.|`|VCCKfT3taa	If a baby is three to six months old and has a fever of over 101.0 then that's a good time to rush them to the hospital. (Once they reach 6 months, that number goes up to 103.)<br>  Some babies will do nothing but sleep when they're sick and some can't sleep at all. Just be sure to hold him and comfort him as much as possible. He'll only keep you up for a few nights at most, but a sick baby needs to be cuddled. That's the best thing you can do for him. ^_^<br>  Also, let him sleep in your arms if you can! It'll help him breathe, since when you have a head cold it can be hard to sleep straight on your back. <br>  It's okay to schedule a doc's appt when they open back up, to have them listen to his lungs and make sure he's breathing okay and to calm any fears you might have. Don't worry about feeling silly, I've done it twice now.|`|SaX09eNtaa	I have an 11 month old and she's been sick before like that. Unfortunately, the degree for a temperature is much higher than you may think.  They say 103 degrees and higher is when the Dr would see them.  My daughter has had the same symptoms and her Pediatrician says to use a cool mist vaporizor, alternate between baby Tylenol and Baby Motrin (they work differently) and use saline drops in his nose for the stuffiness.  Also, you could try bathing him in the Johnson & Johnson (?) Vapor Bath.  Hope this helps!!|`|IOU6zo9Raa	don't let temp go over 102. just keep suctioning his nose, using a humidifier (or sit with him in the bathroom with a hot shower running) keep giving tylenol or sitch back and fourth b/t tylenol and motrin according to the directions however many hours. He needs to sleep, but it's hard to do when you can't breathe. Lay with him or let him sleep in your arms
IFDfpbFJaa	I always gave my dad a present on mothers day cause he was a single dad raising me by himself. He was my dad and my mom. It was just a little way I could make him smile on the inside when times were really tough and stressful for us.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I understand the idea and meaning behind it but your right we already have mother's day.|`|QR6IHIZxaa	i think the person meant it to be something new for single parents all together, yes it is kinda silly lol but i think she meant it for all the right reasons. I think its an okay idea, on the other hand my fiance says its wayyyy stupid lol, and he wants me to write ' if it was a good idea the card companies would have already made it' lol... <br>  aniways i think the person means well :]|`|w5kQ98Fxaa	I think it's a fantastic idea.<br>  <br>  What other days in the year do single mom's get honored?<br>  <br>  Yeah, we have Mother's Day to say 'thanks for being my mom' but what day do we have to say 'thanks for being my dad too'.<br>  <br>  Now we just need a Mother's Day card for single dads.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	LOL, that's taking it a bit far!<br>  Wow, the world has gone crazy with commercial crap...|`|MA9XuLlHaa	that is **** up. single mom get on my ******* nerve.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Maybe it isn't really for the mom as it is the child wanting to show their appreciation and recognize that they did do the role of two parents, if that's the case|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Um, yeah.  I think most holidays are a government's conspiracy for people to buy things.  I mean, Father's Day is nice but that is beginning to take it a bit far.
3Hm5eJfVaa	Same idea but not same thing. Baby Einsteins are geared for infants and little einsteins are geared for toddlers and preschoolers.|`|mhfgvvrJaa	No dear they are not the same thing!|`|CpWGvDvRaa	No; little Einsteins is more of cartoon and for toddlers. My daughter likes that one too, but she is sort of off tv now and obsessed with being outside. She is 16 months. :) We let HER choose what she likes and does not like. She liked TV for awhile and now she is more partial to other things. :)  Don't listen to anyone on here who will try to take away your child's freedom of expression. :)|`|LzwghKMOaa	they are not the same thing... Baby Einsteins is moe for babies and little einsteins is fi for pre schoolers. My 3 month old daughter loves baby einteins.. I bought her 14 dvds.. and 6 of the cds
rN0b4jWHaa	No -__- we tried that, my brother bought tickets for us and him and then the guy who you give your ticket to asked for an ID and i was like oh ****..so yea doesn't work unless your with your mom or something.|`|w5kQ98Fxaa	Should be.<br>  <br>  My friend saw like 1000000000000 R rated movies in his early teens because his dad would call ahead and pay for the tickets on a credit card, my friend would turn up with one of the rest of us and we'd pick up the tickets and go into the theatre without anyone bothering us.<br>  <br>  That is mainland Europe though, not the USA.. Authorities here are way less uptight about age limits and violence/sex etc.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes and no. it depends on the person taking the tickets. they have the right to I.D. before they allow you entrance to the movie even if u already bought the ticket.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Well, yeah.  They aren't going to question him when they check the ticket.  All they really care about is if you have the ticket or not (talking about the ticket checkers at the door that is).|`|5ec33564f14c948f72d08b070f65250eaa	Yea he should be fine.  And if not we always find a decent looking adult (not rapist looking) and walk in with him as though he's our dad or something.  My friends and i havent been caught yet.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	No, it is not. He needs to be eighteen or older to buy tickets for an R rated movie.|`|6OplSEQkaa	i know that here in mass, as long as the person under 17 is with a 17 year old when enterin the theater then u get in.|`|H6LxeWZfaa	Yess im pretty very sure.<br>  unless the worker is super paranoid<br>  they should let him|`|Av9jeRAkaa	ummm..I dont....i guess soo...|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I've gotten into R rated movies since I was 13.<br>  The movie attendants don't care.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	sure, i don't think it should be a problem.  most ticket takers could care less who walks in and usually don't pay attention (or put two and two together) to who's going to what movie.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Yes, how do you think little kids get into R rated movies, older people buy their tickets for them. Plus most places don't care.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I'm sure he won't get in trouble, but technically if they catch him, they'll kick hin out.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	I don't think so.
rFtKFp03aa	Shower in the am.. bath at night... :) <br>  <br>  Need that bath to relax at the end of the day|`|aDQgLEbuaa	I shower at night.  There is no way I could get my butt out of bed to shower in the morning.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Shower in the morning, bath at night.|`|R5YkSeLEaa	in the morning|`|IsQckOXraa	at night <br>  so i can sleep in!<br>  :)|`|7sIGQIbxaa	well I recommend you to shower in the morning so you feel like starting your day. for me it really wakes me up for the sleep I long for, so I can start my day. But I do recon mend to rinse at night but not your hair the oil in your hair gives you volume without it your hair wouldn't be shiny and have volume..that is why hairdressers recon mend you to wash your hair every other day.The oil disappears from your scalp by washing your hair every day..so just rinse at night and wash in the morning..|`|dPHUbKbmaa	I shower in the morning and again at night. The nighttime shower is more like a quick rinse. I just can't stand going to sleep with hairspray, gel, etc. in my hair.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Both.<br>  <br>  I feel gross from the day<br>  <br>  And I like being clean when I slip into my 1000 Count Egyptian Cotton Sheets. :)<br>  <br>  Then in the morning because I do my hair.|`|qQ3D5Yz3aa	Always in the morning - definitely helps me wake up.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	Every Saturday night whether I need it or not.|`|tAFPbAUaaa	First thing in the morning|`|Cz9medZEaa	I love to shower in the mornings|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I shower in the morning mostly because I don't get off work until 2am and on my days off I am just ready to sleep early. Jaiden sits in her bouncer when I take my baths. <br>  <br>  I told my husband that I'm going to start taking bath/showers at night now because I need my personal time. As soon as I walked in last night she woke up so that was a no go. Better luck tonight?! <br>  <br>  If she is asleep when I get home I'm going to do my bath time, and when I'm off and he is watching her, it's my bath time lol. I don't always want my daughter in the bathroom with me.
966w9UQTaa	I had boy/girl twins on Wednesday, so whatever it says it'll be right lol|`|AA11197832	I entered in my son's conception date and the results were correct.. He's a boy alright lol.<br>  <br>  I also entered in the information for my current pregnancy and it said girl.  Im so hoping it's right lol.  I want a girl this time around!!! <br>  Good Question|`|isH4APEcaa	me and my boyfriend have said it'll be a girl and the predictor said so too...now all i have to do is wait and see!!|`|333e3165a0426e11bbd47089d6ab94a6aa	no said i had a boy and i had a girl :)|`|fbe8face4c64fd238c4d4c3fd28046a7aa	sorry it was wrong. hopefully it will be right for you:) Good Luck|`|TczFL0p0aa	oh yay i hope i get a boy!|`|VdnAH78Xaa	haha mine was right!|`|hWe8vhKKaa	it was right for me|`|M6c0hUefaa	Nope, it was wrong, but I never knew my EXACT conception day, so I guess it 'could' be right :)|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Haha wow it was right :)! Interesting!|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	haha - nope it was wrong!  It said boy and I have a beautiful 7.5 month old little girl!!!|`|vGxipYJnaa	Yes - correct for all three of our kids.. although I couldn't be sure exactly what the day I conceived was.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Mine was correct for my little girl.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Nope.|`|AA10015577	I did this with my first and it said boy, he was a boy.  I did this with my second and it said boy, we just found out two weeks ago, it's a boy!  Coincidence?  I also did this for 6 other people and only one time it was wrong.  I know that it is 50/50 chance though, but it's all in good fun, more fun if it turns out right!<br>  <br>  I didn't use this chart predictor.  I just tried it and it said girl, wrong.  This one was a bit weird and different.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	No! it said I was having a girl and I got a almost 9 lb boy.lol. I really dont know the exact conception day tho.|`|AA11347204	Wrong for my son right for my daughter|`|M9M6nTZeaa	It was very accurate! I wish I had've done this when I was still pregnant! I wanted to know so bad! LOL!|`|9dvmMRX4aa	Nope it was wrong lol sorry|`|SjX72fPyaa	It was right for me lol|`|f4zg7LHLaa	wrong. it said girl, i have a handsome little man!|`|heDtLdz5aa	nope..it told me i was having a girl...and i had a boy is is 16 months now
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Thats exactly what happened for me. <br>  When I was almost 21 I gave birth to my first little girl. I was on top of the world. My husband and I decided that we wanted another little one. We tried for 3.5 years and nothing. I was sad, but decided that I was lucky to have my first little girl and to be happy. <br>  After I decided to give up, I realized that I was unhealthy. I took some time, I adopted an exercises routine, I ate better, and I lost 56lbs. Just as soon as I did that, we were surprised by our daughter. I know it was because I adopted a better lifestyle for myself. Since our second daughter we've added 2 more little boys, with no problems at all. <br>  I am a firm believer that being healthy can help a lot with getting pregnant. <br>  Lots of luck on getting pregnant!!|`|xZWP2mqjaa	Whilst getting yourself healthy isn't a bad idea before getting pregnant, there's no guarantee that doing so WILL result in pregnancy.<br>  I have PCOS and I'm overweight. I got pregnant the first time within 2 months of not using condoms. Wasn't expecting it obviously (my doctor's way of telling me I had PCOS was "Well, you never really wanted kids anyway did you") but it happened.<br>  I'm even heavier now than I was when I got pregnant with #1 and yet, within 3 months of having my coil removed, I was pregnant again. <br>  So, change your diet by all means and get yourself into the best shape you can to cope with the pregnancy but I don't think it will make it easier to conceive.<br>  PS. My best mate, also PCOS sufferer, had unprotected sex for years with her long-term boyfriend.  She'd been told she had NO chance of children due to the severity of her condition. She now has a 4 1/2 yr old daughter. And not to her long-termer - they split up, she met someone else and fell pregnant within 6 months.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	i was just after going on a diet when i got pregnant. was after cutting out all the crap food like sweets and chips. me and my partner had been trying for awhile then when i went on the diet i got pregnant nearly straight away. i don't know if it was just the timing or if the diet actually had anything to do with it tho. best of luck :)|`|M1u6fdZCaa	I dropped to 116lbs (I'm 5'8) right before I got pregnant...I became extremely active and once I became pregnant, I wasn't so concerned with how much I will weigh, even though my doctor was wanting me to gain a lot...I also didn't plan on getting pregnant, it just happened right after I lost weight|`|4E2BoVptaa	My OB told me that TTC would be much easier if I lost some weight. I had been TTC for two years. So, I went on a diet. I started working out more. I lost 40lbs and got pregnant fairly quickly!! So, dieting worked for me.|`|NTfIJa7zaa	My husband and I TTC for 3 years before I finally got pregnant. I am overweight and lost about 40-50 lbs before conceiving. So I am pretty sure that helped. Good luck to you!|`|T48smu01aa	I lost 10 pounds becoming pregnant I didn't exactly do it the healthy way either I was 135 at 5'2 and so I kinda did a crash diet a big no no but I did it and I lost 10 pounds in a week with just drinking slim fast and exercises and of course tons of water.....so I then was about 123 125 when I became pregnant ha ha now I am 167 at 7 1/2 months pregnant ha ha I eat everything in sight :) I als took prenatal pills for 3 months  b4 getting pregnant......I also heard with PCOS if you take in a ot of folic acid it helps with getting pregnant faster, I am not completely sure I would ask your doctor though it doesn't hurt to take extra folic acid :)<br>  Good luck!|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Well I finally got the motivation to lose my previous baby weight, then decided to TTC again. I lost 30 lbs (bringing me down to 135lb) and was doing the weight watchers program (without meetings) and going to the gym daily. I am not sure if this contributed to conceiving in 6 months or not but I felt a lot better...good luck!
29b4e5d522e3e0d96e9b23d1811a302baa	I think your parents are a little to controlling and afraid of losing you. (Are you an only child?) If they tell you that if you move out and they will never talk to you again, what is going to happen in the future if you stay with them and let them control your LIFE? Will you be able to chose the job you want? Will you be able to marry? Will they even try to pick your husband? If you have children and you live with them, who do think is going to raise your children, you or them? Yes parents do know is best, but unfortunately for them it is your life when you turn 18. You are going to have to decide what is best for your life at some point in your life. Me I would maybe think about the college thing. The way the economy is going, it might be better to stay home and go to a local college, unless you got a full scholarship from the school. But you need to sit down and talk to them. Maybe you should turn the tables on them. After college, tell them that you are going to find the job YOU want. Maybe you will get a little apartment after that think about getting married to the person of YOUR choosing, not theirs. And if they don't listen and they still say you have to listen to them, then let them think they're winning and when they are not expecting anything pack your things and get out. Tell them the reasons why you left and why you left this way. Make sure to include that, when you meet the perfect guy and get married, maybe they be invited to the wedding and when you decided to have children, that maybe they will get to see the baby. ( if you do get out like the way I say always keep the door open for them, but on your terms. You never know they may change their minds) I know cutting parents out of your life is will be extremely hard, but sooner or later you will have to leave the nest. If you decided to leave make sure you have plenty of money and a place to stay; you don't want to go back to your parents with your tail between your legs and telling them you were wrong and they were right. If you do, you might never be able to have the life you want.  <br>  ****OR****<br>  Since you have a best friend maybe your best friends parents can talk to them. Listening to other parents might help them let go you, but you might patience and wait for the moment to move on with your life. AND talk with your best friends parents as well, they could be your life saver.|`|3oSQQt6maa	That is a little too much from your parents. You should just talk to them about how you feel. THey are more than likely afraid of leaving you alone to make decisons. But they have to let you grow up sooner or later.|`|f6qmRicQaa	When I was your age I had a friend who's dad was the Islands prison warden.  He was tough as nails, strict and ridged in his rules.  He and her mother were a lot like yours in that they didn't let her have a life.  She didn't go to dances, wasn't allowed to participate in extra curricular activities and couldn't spend the night at friends houses.  They wanted her to go to the local collage, and like yours had her life planned for her.  She felt trapped, like she didn't have a choice but to follow their plan.  I mean what do you do when you want to go to collage and your parents will only support you if you go where they want you to.  How will you support yourself.  You know what she did?  She went to her collage anyway.  She applied for a scholarship, got student loans, grants and packed her bags come the fall after graduation, which was after she turned 18, and went to start a new life.  She got a job, went to school and after 4 years of struggle she graduated.  It's been 10 years since she graduated collage and she hasn't even gone to visit her parents.  <br>  Look at some point you will be old enough to make these decisions for yourself.  You will be mature enough to ignore your parents threats and live your own life.  Their demands on you for your future are just that, THEIR DEMANDS, you don't have to play their game.  When your mature enough you'll realize this and go on with your plans.  If they don't want to talk to you then it will be their loss, it won't be your fault.  If your willing to work hard to achive your goals they will be yours.|`|tKb7i5jtaa	You should pull your parents aside and say, "Listen to me. I am your daughter, and I love you guys. But I need to be able to make my own decisions. I feel as if you don't trust me and that I am totally alone. I want to go to this college, not the local one. I want you to be a part of my life, but I am almost an adult, and if you refuse to talk to me if I move out, then you are not only going to lose me, you will lose what you are trying so hard to protect." Sorry, I know that sounds corny, but parents will listen to corny stuff. If this doesn't work, or makes them mad, they may be a wee bit crazy :(|`|ofCRTXw9aa	Yepp your parents seem crazy. They're way too over protective. I really do think you should go to that college thats further away. Theres no way they would actually pull through with never talking to you, seeing as they are so overprotective of you. They do care and all, they just dont want you to turn out like those skanky girls all over the place, and they probably think that if they start letting you do things (even small things like hang out with female friends,) that you'll start becomming like every other girl. They also probably think you'll do stuff behind their back. Some parents are like that. They're just scared of how you'll turn out or what you'll get mixed in with. In their heads, what they're doing is good for you, but in reality it will make you want to push them away from you. My parents used to be this way. But i rebeled, and got a boyfriend. They have REALLY gotten better since then, because I guess they saw that even with a boyfriend, I wasn't becomming like every other teenager out there. I think you should just start doing SMALL things that they don't like. & explain to them that you will be an adult in a year (or even less) and you need to start gaining control of your OWN life. & whatever you do, DO NOT follow what they want you to do with your life. You get the job YOU want, and date who YOU want, and do what makes YOU happy.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Wow..you sound like me back in 1965. I was never allowed to date, go to any school functions, basically nothing. I graduated high school on the 5th of June and joined the Army on the 9th. I left for basic training and never lived at home again. The military will train you for jobs or even pay for collage. Don't know if you want to do anything that drastic.

You just have to ask the deli too see the labels, unless you can find some pre-packaged meats. My diabetic grandfather always had low sodium lunch meat.

enTV6zktaa	NEW MOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! stupendo!<br>  cmq bella ed edward riprendono la scuola come sempre, il compleanno di bella si festeggia a casa dei cullen ma bella prendendo un biglietto di auguri si fa un tagli alla mano e jasper (che è il meno allenato all'odore del sangue nella famiglia dei vampiri cullen) attacca bella ma edward si para davanti x preoteggerla. bella è scioccata e jasper dispiaciutissimo xche n si è saputo controllare ma il resto della famiglia non permette che qll sera bella e jasper si vedano x parlarne. da li edward è molto timoroso. inizia ad avere un atteggiamento diverso, come se si stesse stufando di bela, e balla se ne accorge subito. un giorno  edward le dice che devono parlare e esordisce con una frase che è 'bella stiamo per adarcene' . a quel punto bella inizialmente capisce la famiglia cullen e lei. ma poi edward le spiega che è solo la famiglia cullen che se ne deve andare xche essendo immortali sono gia li da tre anni e non sono cambiati di una ruga in viso quindi devono cercare un altro posto o avrebbero destato sospetti. edward fa promettere a bella di non cacciarsi nei guai e poi se ne va di colpo. bella inizia a sentirsi male e a vagare nella foresta cercandolo x tre giorni. poi lo ritrovano i ragazzi di lapush con i poliziotti. bella viene riportata a casa e dopo essersi riposata fruga in camera sua e vede che non ci sono piu i regali della famiglia cullen e il cd che le aveva fatto edward con le sue composizioni di paino x lei, allora ricorda quella sua frase prima che se ne andasse 'sara come se non fossi mai esistito. tutto tornera normale x te'<br>  da quel giorno bella è spenta. non cerca piu gli amici di scuola e anche quelli dpo un po non si fanno piu sentire. non ascolta piu musica. non fa niente di niente anzi fa lo stretto necessario x sopravvivere. fino a che non incontra jacob.<br>  in quel periodo jacob è il suo raggio di luce nel cielo, la sua goccia d'acqua nel deserto, la sua unica ragione x alzarsi la mattina. da li rinizia a frequentare un po di amici e, per assecondare suo padre, bella esce con jessica la classica pettegola della scuola. questo passaggio è importanta xche bella sente la voce di edward x la prima volta. erano lei e jessica in un vicolo buio e si avvicina a una banda di ragazzi che le sembravano minacciosi mentre jessica la prega di andare via. la banda le prega piu volte di rimanere ed è li che bella sente la voce di edward nella testa che le dice 'sei un idota non fare cose stupide ti farai ammazzare non essere sciocca'.<br>  da li blella decide di provare qualsiasi cosa rischiosa in modo da sentire di nuovo edward. infatti con jacob ripara due moto e, mentre lei va x la prima volta, sente di nuovo edward. <br>  un giorno xo vede jacob triste e lui le speiga che i suoi amici(di jacob) si stanno comportando in modo strano, si sono tutti rapati a zero, sono sempre iu muscolosi e hanno lasciato da parte lui e un altro suo amico. ma li è solo un accenno. la verita si scoprira dopo.<br>  infatti giorni dopo anche jacob non si fa piu sentire e bella è disperata e si chiede xche. il padre le risponde che sta male e che appena fosse stato meglio si sarebbe fatto risentire. ma non è cosi. bella un giorno va a trovarlo a lapush e lo vede con i suoi vecchi amici, anche lui rapato a zero e parecchio muscoloso. lui è ostile con lei  ma alla fine le spiega che i suoi amici non fanno neitne di male. ma che sono licantropi e che anche lui adesso si è trasformato x le prime volte. le spiega che i licantropi sono nemici naturali dei vampiri, si muovono altrettanto veloci(niente trasformazione in luna piena o cose del genere) ma invecchiano e si possono rompere qualche osso, anche se guariscono 10volte piu velocemente di un umano. quando sono trasformati in lupi sentono ogniuno il pensiero dellaltro all'interno del branco.<br>  un giorno l'amico di charlie( il padre di bella ) muore d'infarto e bella e jacob ne discutono sulla scogliera, parlando e passeggiando. ad un certo punto jacob viene chiamato dal branco a distanza di tre chilometri xche sentono l'odore di victoria da quelle parti e lui le dice 'torno subito'.<br>  a quel punto bella si ritrova tutta sola ed è un po che non sente piu la voce di edward nella testa, allora decide di buttarsi dalla scogliera x finire in mare, cosa che aveva gia visto fare dal branco per divertimento. ma una volta caduta nell'acqua gelida, non capisce piu qual'è il fondo e qual'è la superficie allora smette di lottare e si lascia portare giu mentre la voce di edward è disperata. bella si risveglia sulla riva in braccio a jacob e la pirma cosa che vide nel mare in lontananza è una specie di fiamma rossa che si muove con il vento lontano, all'orizzonte del mare.<br>  dopo che bella di è riposata, jacob le spiega che mentre lei stava affogando, victoria la stava er catturare e che la fiamma che lei aveva visto erano i suoi capelli rossi.<br>  mentre jacob e bella tornano a casa di bella, jacob sente odore di vampiro vicino alla casa di bella. mentre la sta per portare via e correre, bella vede la macchina del papa di edward, il dottor cullen, fuori da casa sua. allora prega jacob di fidarsi e di lasciarla entrare in casa. jacob le augura buona fortune e lei entra e vede una figura dall'altro capo del corridoio buio.<br>  FINE

z6IekuwSaa	First, pumping in no way will show you how much he is eating. <br>  2. You can increase your milk supply by feeding on demand, pumping after a feeding, fenugreek, mother's milk tea, prescribed reglan, staying hydrated<br>  3.You should not be concerned as long as he is gaining weight and giving you diapers to change<br>  4. Sleeping has nothing to do with eating, they sleep longer when they are developmentally ready to do so.<br>  Your body is establishing a supply right now. Give it a few more weeks and everything will work out. He will get more efficient at the breast with more practice and he could possibly get his nursing time down to even 5 min. It gets better with time. Hang in there!<br>  <br>  Also caffiene and sleep deprevation contribute to low milk supply. And how much you are pumping is how much I was makin when my daughter was that age. One day though your body just knows and you start producing high amounts (getting ready for a growth spurt)|`|yB5go5wbaa	you're making enough milk - babies are much more efficient at nursing than a pump is.  he's got plenty of wet diapers.  newborns just nurse a lot to regulate your milk supply so that a feeding routine for them can be established.  he doesn't need anymore, so don't supplement!  you're also coming up on a 3 week growth spurt (I just got done with it, mine's 1 month old) - and they seem like they're nursing all the time and not getting enough.  eating every 1 to 2 hours is normal.  mine would literally eat every 20 minutes for 20-30 minutes at a time.  it's exhausting, but it is getting better now; he's been going 3 to 4 hours most of the time between feedings.<br>  <br>  the reason for the decrease in your amount of pumping is just because your supply is regulating.  your body wants to run as efficient as possible and won't make more than is being demanded.<br>  <br>  just keep nursing him on demand and don't supplement!  congrats on your baby and for breast feeding :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	What you can pump has nothing to do with how much milk you have, regardless of how good the pump is.  The pump just doesn't stimulate supply the way the baby does, when the baby nurses as the milk level drops the breasts make more milk faster the emptier the breast.<br>  <br>  On the other hand a baby with nipple confusion can't get the milk that is there, so it really wouldn't matter how much milk you have.  A baby that hasn't been nursing well can prevent you developing a full supply.<br>  <br>  The fact that your baby is more than 5 days old and less than 4 weeks old and not having three poopy diapers a day or more is another sign that the baby isn't nursing as well as they should be and simply not getting enough fat and calories even though they are getting enough fluid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVDec97Jan98p123.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVDe...</a><br>  In answer to the question, "Is baby getting enough?" a second question could be posed, "Enough of which?" In the early weeks wet diaper counts give only part of the answer. Because the nursing newborn takes in plenty of foremilk before receiving the richer hindmilk, it would be difficult for an infant to produce several bowel movements per day without being adequately hydrated.<br>  <br>  However, the opposite can easily occur. Since feeding practices, ineffective sucking or other problems may diminish the mother's milk supply or prevent the baby from receiving an adequate portion of hindmilk, it is possible for a baby to be adequately hydrated yet have an inadequate calorie intake. Frequent urination remains one valid indicator of adequate newborn hydration from foremilk intake. Multiple daily stooling is an indicator of adequate newborn calorie intake from hindmilk. Both factors are needed to fully assess neonatal breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Since a lack of daily stooling may be associated with inadequate newborn calorie intake, it is also a predictor of poor infant weight gain. Early detection of this symptom can be crucial for the baby's health and the continuation of breastfeeding. In severe cases, an infant's low calorie intake may lead to weaker sucking, diminished milk supply and critical dehydration. While less serious conditions may be improved at various stages of breastfeeding, it is much more effective to establish a generous milk supply and hearty weight gain in the early weeks than to have to work to achieve them in later months.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  On occasion a mother calling with a deceptively simple or unrelated question will describe notably infrequent newborn stooling when asked. Sometimes it has been overlooked or, using the criteria for older babies, labeled normal. Sometimes, under the advice of family, friends or health workers, this has already been treated as constipation. During the 1990s mothers have related such treatments as: changes made in the mother's diet; various supplements for baby including glucose or corn syrup water, fruit juices, or pureed fruits; various types of anal stimulation, anal dilation and enemas of vegetable oil. In cases of infrequent newborn stooling, babies are often known to have or are later found to have poor weight gain.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/avoidingnipple.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/avo...</a><br>  One study found that 95% of babies will become confused if given a bottle during the first 3-4 weeks of life. For some babies it may take many bottles before they show any nipple confusion; for others it can take only one or two. For this reason it is best to avoid offering your baby a bottle before he is 4 weeks of age.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/b-protocol_increase_bmilk_intake.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/b-protoco...</a><br>  Protocol to Increase Breastmilk Intake by the Baby<br>  ("Not enough milk")<br>  Handout B: Protocol to Increase Breastmilk Intake by the Baby<br>  by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPC. ? 2005<br>  Revised: January 2005<br>   <br>  <br>  Here is the way I suggest mothers proceed for "insufficient milk supply" (actually, most mothers have lots or could have had lots, but the problem is that the baby is not getting the milk that is available).<br>  <br>     1.<br>        Get the best latch possible. This needs to be shown by someone who knows what they are doing. Anyone can look at the baby at the breast and say the latch is good. The accompanying diagram shows how to get a good latch. If a mother has plenty of milk, the latch does not have to be perfect. But, if the milk supply is decreased, the baby will get more milk if he is latched on better. Get good “hands on” help. Videos can be seen at www.thebirthden.com/Newman.html that show you how to best latch a baby on.<br>  <br>     2.<br>        Know how to know the baby is getting milk. When a baby is getting milk (he is not getting milk just because he has the breast in his mouth and is making sucking movements), you will see a pause at the point of his chin after he opens to the maximum and before he closes his mouth, so that one suck is (open mouth wide-->pause-->close mouth). If you wish to demonstrate this to yourself, put your index or other finger in your mouth and suck as if you were sucking on a straw. As you draw in, your chin drops and stays down as long as you are drawing in. When you stop drawing in, your chin comes back up. This pause that is visible at the baby's chin represents a mouthful of milk when the baby does it at the breast. The longer the pause, the more the baby got. Once you know about the pause you can cut through so much of the nonsense breastfeeding mothers are being told—such as “Feed the baby twenty minutes on each side”. A baby who does this type of sucking (with the pause) for twenty minutes straight might not even take the second side. A baby who nibbles (doesn't drink) for 20 hours will come off the breast hungry. You can see this “pause” on the videos at www.thebirthden.com/Newman.html<br>  <br>     3.<br>        Once the baby is no longer drinking on his own, use compression to increase flow to the baby. Compression can be particularly helpful, but don't forget trying to get the best latch possible first. Babies tend to pull at the breast when the flow of milk is slow, so it is useful to know how to know the baby is actually getting milk and not just sucking without getting milk. When the baby no longer seems to be getting milk, and is sucking without getting milk, this is when to start compression, while the baby sucks, but does not drink. Keep the baby on the first breast until he doesn't drink even with compression. See handout #15 Breast Compression. You can see this how to use compression on the videos at www.thebirthden.com/Newman.html<br>  <br>     4.<br>        When the baby no longer drinks even with compression, switch sides and repeat the process. Keep going back and forth as long as the baby gets reasonable amounts of milk at the breast.<br>  <br>     5.<br>        Try fenugreek and blessed thistle. These two herbs seem to increase milk supply and increase rate of milk flow. There is more information on the handout #24 Cabbage Leaves, Herbs, Lecithin.|`|CFFuFof1aa	I wouldn't be concerned. I think instead of pumping every 1.5 hours, you need to wait to pump for about four hours. My milk didn't come in for a few weeks as well. My doctor told me to feed the baby, and as soon as she got through, to pump each breast for about 10 minutes. So I would feed her, then pump each one for about 10 minutes each. It took about a week but after doing that, it came in, and I mean I could have had enough for two babies. Just do that for a while, and whatever you get extra just put in the freezer. The urination and pooping sounds right. Your body will only produce what the baby eats, so by pumping after the baby gets through, it will make your body think that it needs to produce more. Good luck, hun!!|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	The amount of milk you pump has absolutely no relevance. Baby is much more efficient than even a hospital grade pump. My daughter has been nursing for 22 months, yet I have never pumped more than 1/2 oz total from both sides.<br>  <br>  It is more likely that he is going through a growth spurt. Nursing every hour or so is *normal* for a newborn. So is waking up every hour or so, especially during a growth spurt. The reason he sleeps longer with the formula is because it is so hard on his little tummy to digest. <br>  <br>  There really isn't anything to be concerned about. Trust your body and your baby, and continue feeding on demand. So long as he is having wet/dirty diapers, and is not losing weight, you can rest assured he is getting enough. <br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that supplementing with formula can be a slippery slope. Especially this early in the game, it can really mess with your supply. If you are hoping to breastfeed long-term, I'd strongly consider dropping the formula feeding as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  As far as getting more sleep, have you considered co-sleeping? Maybe even just for naps if you're not totally comfortable. Once you learn to nurse in a side-lying position, it is easier to rest and take a cat nap while baby naps. You can also take comfort in knowing that this pattern won't likely last much longer. He is still so little - he will switch things up on you again soon, I promise. Just let the housework go and concentrate on nursing him.

Yet I have seen so many moms whose babies have looked healthy, nursed well, met developmental milestones one right after the other and have lost all confidence in breastfeeding due to someone telling them that their baby's weight was not on the charts. This someone was looking at the scale and charts, rather than the baby.<br>  <br>  In the first 24 to 72 hours after birth babies tend to lose about 3-10% of their birth weight and then regain that weight over the next 2 to 3 weeks. If a mother receives lots of IV fluids during labor, the baby could be born "heavier" because of the increased water. The somewhat higher weight could be measured if a baby were weighed right before it peed for the first time. The difference of this extra fluid retention might only be a few ounces, but some parents are told to be concerned when, at their baby's two week checkup, the baby is a few ounces under birth weight.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  If you have been told that weight gain is not acceptable, look hard at this list of questions:<br>  <br>      * Is your baby eager to nurse?<br>      * Is your baby peeing and pooping well?<br>      * Is your baby's urine either clear or very pale yellow?<br>      * Are your baby's eyes bright and alert?<br>      * Is your baby's skin a healthy color and texture?<br>      * Is your baby moving its arms and legs vigorously?<br>      * Are baby's nails growing?<br>      * Is your baby meeting developmental milestones?<br>      * Is your baby's overall disposition happy and playful?<br>      * Yes, your baby sleeps a lot, but when your baby is awake does he have periods of being very alert?<br>  <br>  If you have answered yes to the above questions, you may want to progress on to two important questions which the "charts" seem to ignore.<br>  <br>      * How tall is mom?<br>      * How tall is dad?<br>  <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  There can be nursing problems that can cause slow weight gain; an inadequate "latch-on" is probably the only common breastfeeding problem in the first weeks. This is an easily remedied problem with the right help. In the best of circumstances, breastfeeding should be assessed within the first day or two after birth by a skilled lactation expert. Good hospitals have these LC's and IBCLC's on staff and, if not, please line up a consultation within the first 12 hours of life. Your pediatrician can help you with this. If not, call La Leche League and ask them whom they recommend in your area. This is a crucial step in becoming a parent and must not be skipped.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <a href="http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#WeightLoss" rel="nofollow">http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#We...</a><br>  What is Normal Weight Loss?<br>  <br>  It is normal for breastfed babies to lose from 7% to 10% of their birth weight, and it can take up to 3 weeks for the breastfed baby to regain birth weight. Weight should always be calculated from lowest weight ever, not birth weight, for the most accurate picture of the baby's growth. See "Why Babies Lose Weight" for more information.<br>  <br>  A breastfed baby's rate of weight gain may vary widely. A complete picture of baby's growth should be viewed, not just an assessment of weight gain. Growth in length, and head circumference are as important as actual weight gain. Genetics play a part in how baby gains, as well as where and how the baby is weighed. Weight checks should ALWAYS be done on the same exact scales and in the same type of clothing (or done with baby naked).  <br>  <br>  ---------<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkcalc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkc...</a><br>  In exclusively breastfed babies, milk intake increases quickly during the first few weeks of life, then stays about the same between one and six months (though it likely increases short term during growth spurts). Current breastfeeding research does not indicate that breastmilk intake changes with baby's age or weight between one and six months. After six months, breastmilk intake will continue at this same level until -- sometime after six months, depending in baby's intake from other foods -- baby's milk intake begins to decrease gradually (see below).<br>  <br>  The research tells us that exclusively breastfed babies take in an average of 25 oz (750 mL) per day between the ages of 1 month and 6 months. Different babies take in different amounts of milk; a typical range of milk intakes is 19-30 oz per day (570-900 mL per day).<br>  <br>  We can use this information to estimate the average amount of milk baby will need at a feeding:<br>  <br>      * Estimate the number of times that baby nurses per day (24 hours).<br>      * Then divide 25 oz by the number of nursings.<br>      * This gives you a "ballpark" figure for the amount of expressed milk your exclusively breastfed baby will need at one feeding.<br>  <br>  Example: If baby usually nurses around 8 times per day, you can guess that baby might need around 3 ounces per feeding when mom is away. (25/8=3.1).|`|5c500787631901c9ca4d11eaca666897aa	If she has 6 wet and 4 dirty diapers a day she is getting enough. ALL babies drop some of their weight after birth-they're designed to use the "brown fat" that they've acquired just for that time. My baby lost weight after delivery too and the hospital guilted me into using formula. But i spoke with a lactation consultant and went back to just using breastmilk, and she gained back her weight and then some at her one week dr. appt.

The 7% rule is merely to get those few moms and babies that do need help to a lactation consultant sooner rather than later.  There is never any harm to seeing a lactation consultant, hence the conservative rule.<br>  <br>  Most babies that loose more than 10% are also normal and healthy, babies born to mom's that had a large amount of IV fluid may also loose more than 10%<br>  <br>  10% of 6lbs is 9.6 oz-so dropping to 5lbs 6.4 oz is considered NORMAL.  So your baby is right at the line of concern. However again I must emphasize that means getting breastfeeding help; not formula.<br>  <br>  Of concern is the fact your baby only nurses 6 times per day.  Its best to aim for 8-12, now not all babies will nurse that much.  I have one that wouldn't nurse more than 6-7 times per day, and slept two 6 hour stretches at night and yet managed to gain TOO MUCH weight according to the charts (10oz per week his first 4 weeks).  But your baby is at the low end of normal so you should consider at least trying to nurse more often.<br>  <br>  I would also strongly recommend that you don't switch sides after 10 to 15 minutes.  I would burp the baby and then give them the same side, use compressions to make the flow faster.  If the baby shows no interest in the first side THEN offer the second side.  4+ poopy diapers a day strongly suggest she is getting enough fat and calories, but switching after a set amount of time cause problems.  Also a breastfed baby that needs to burp a lot is probably not latched on all that well and may have trouble getting out all the milk that is in the breast.<br>  <br>  A lactation consultant should also be able to check for tongue tie which would explain both the low gain, long nursing, and slow bottle feeding.  There are many other professionals who can assess tongue tie if this sounds like your baby:<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVAprMay02p27.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVApr...</a><br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/faq/az12.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/faq/az12.asp</a><br>  <br>  I hope I have been clear and given you some good resources to help find an answer to your specific questions.  If I missed something or you need clarification feel free to e-mail me.  I'm not a lactation consultant, but helping nursing moms get the help they need is what I do now to "give back" to society.  So I have a lot of facts and resources crammed into my poor brain.<br>  <br>  ============<br>  <br>  <br>  As to your specific questions:<br>  "Would my daughter still get the same benefits from breastfeeding than a baby that is solely breastfed if she was given formula too?"<br>  <br>  No, absolutely not.  While it is certainly true that every drop of breastmilk is beneficial there is a vast difference between exclusive breastmilk feeding (direct or from a bottle) and mixed feeding.  Also, while no one can tell you how many oz of formula it would take before any baby would become sensitized to an allergen (such as milk or soy) -if they ever would most formula risks are dose dependent to a degree.  So replacing half the feeds with formula is worse than formula once every couple of weeks.<br>  <br>  Also I can tell you that if you don't build your supply the first 6 weeks you may never have a full supply, and you are far more likely to have difficulty with low supply the whole time you nurse.<br>  <br>  For more on this specific topic:<br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.org/bfacts/bottle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.org/bfacts/bott...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed.com/articles/issues-for-mom/the-case-for-the-virgin-gut-3451/" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed.com/articles/issue...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.health-e-learning.com/articles/JustOneBottle.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.health-e-learning.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  ---------------<br>  "Would it be incredibly foolish to ignore the midwife and continue to solely breastfeed?

In the early weeks wet diaper counts give only part of the answer. Because the nursing newborn takes in plenty of foremilk before receiving the richer hindmilk, it would be difficult for an infant to produce several bowel movements per day without being adequately hydrated.<br>  <br>  However, the opposite can easily occur. Since feeding practices, ineffective sucking or other problems may diminish the mother's milk supply or prevent the baby from receiving an adequate portion of hindmilk, it is possible for a baby to be adequately hydrated yet have an inadequate calorie intake. Frequent urination remains one valid indicator of adequate newborn hydration from foremilk intake. Multiple daily stooling is an indicator of adequate newborn calorie intake from hindmilk. Both factors are needed to fully assess neonatal breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  --------<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/b-protocol_increase_bmilk_intake.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/b-protoco...</a><br>  Protocol to Increase Breastmilk Intake by the Baby<br>  ("Not enough milk")<br>  <br>  Here is the way I suggest mothers proceed for "insufficient milk supply" (actually, most mothers have lots or could have had lots, but the problem is that the baby is not getting the milk that is available).<br>  #<br>  Once the baby is no longer drinking on his own, use compression to increase flow to the baby.

The baby sleeps through the night. Not necessarily. A baby who is sleeping through the night at 10 days of age, for example, may, in fact, not be getting enough milk. A baby who is too sleepy and has to be awakened for feeds or who is "too good" may not be getting enough milk. There are many exceptions, but get help quickly.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  4. The baby feeds often and/or for a long time. For one mother feeding every three hours or so may be often; for another, three hours or so may be a long period between feeds. For one, a feeding that lasts for 30 minutes is a long feeding; for another, it is a short one. There are no rules how often or for how long a baby should nurse. It is not true that the baby gets 90% of the feed in the first 10 minutes. Let the baby determine his own feeding schedule and things usually come right, if the baby is suckling and drinking at the breast and having at least two to three substantial yellow bowel movements each day. Remember, a baby may be on the breast for two hours, but if he is actually feeding or drinking (open wide—pause—close mouth type of sucking) for only two minutes, he will come off the breast hungry. If the baby falls asleep quickly at the breast, you can compress the breast to continue the flow of milk ****.

Your baby gets more than you can pump.  My baby was 5 lbs 8 oz at birth, and only dropped 3 oz before leaving the hospital. My doctor wanted me to supplement with formula, not replace a breastfeeding session.  She said to only supplement until my milk came in also, not afterwards.  I was also worried about her not getting enough, so I went to a lactation consultant.  She weighed my baby, then had me feed her right there, then weighed her again, to see how many oz she ate.  She was only taking in about 4-5 oz, but was completely satisfied.  She gained weight quickly, and by 1 month, was at 8 lbs.  (She was premature also, by 6 weeks).  I would NOT supplement formula, if I were you until you get her weighed.  Also, you may want to ask if you can weigh her before and after a feeding, if they have a scale that measures to the exact ounce.  That could give you reassurance.

My daughter nursed nearly every hour when she was tiny.<br>  <br>  Also, a midwife is NOT A BREASTFEEDING EXPERT. She is a childbirth expert, yes, but if you need breastfeeding help, you need to find a lactation consultant or a La Leche League leader. If you seek out an LC, find one with the initials IBCLC after her name, not just a nurse with a few hours extra training.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question, no, it is not the same as exclusively breastfeeding. She is missing out on half of your breastmilk, and formula can cause problems. Google "virgin gut" for more.<br>  <br>  In your situation, I would probably try to nurse more often before considering formula. Also, you might try using breast compressions to make sure she is getting enough fatty hindmilk.

That is like every 4 hours (should be every 2-3 from start of feed to start of feed). Yes, it's normal to lose a bit at first, but she's at the very high end of what is acceptable. How are her diapers? How many wet/poopy? I would say feed more often (every 2 hours right now) and if her diapers are low, get an SNS and supplement with formula that way.

Consult with baby's doctor and your lactation consultant if baby is not gaining as expected. <br>  Dirty diapers: In the early days, baby typically has one dirty diaper for each day of life (1 on day one, 2 on day two...). After day 4, stools should be yellow and baby should have at least 3-4 stools daily that are the size of a US quarter (2.5 cm) or larger. Some babies stool every time they nurse, or even more often--this is normal, too.

I just had my baby a month ago and she lost quite a bit off the bat. Because your baby is so young you should definately not let your baby go longer than 4-5 hours without eating. I had a C-section so I was in the hospital for 4 days. While I was there they told me if she went 5 hours without eating they would have to run glucose tests to make sure her blood sugar was ok. So I had to wake her up a couple nights after 4 hours. Also, about the other post. I'm sure it just took a few days for your milk to come in and that's why your baby's weight dropped. If you feel like breastfeeding isn't getting her weight back up, which it should now, you should supplement only a little formula AFTER you breastfeed her. This way your milk supply won't go down and she'll only need a little formula. While I was in the hospital they had me give her 20mL of formula after I breastfed. But again that's while I was waiting for my milk to come in. If you have any other questions or just need to talk, email me I'd love to talk to more moms.|`|VCCKfT3taa	Her weight will be able to answer your question.

0SHOXqb4aa	The baby's size is primarily determined by the size of the mother's pelvis.  Sometimes nature gets it wrong though, and a c section is unavoidable.  But that's assuming that the baby is full term and that the mother doesn't smoke or drink during pregnancy.  These 3 factors can result in a baby being smaller than it would otherwise have been.<br>  <br>  However there is some evidence to suggest that a woman's first child will be a similar size to her own size at birth.

But of course the weight of your baby also varies depending on how far along you were when you gave birth. Usually the baby will take after one parent or the other. For example, big babies can run in a family. <br>  <br>  With our last son, he definitely took after me. I was 8lbs 3 oz. at birth and he was 7lbs 11 oz. at birth. My husband was a very small baby (about 5 1/2 lbs at full term!) so we're pretty certain he's taking after me!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I'm not sure to be honest.  I was born 7lbs 7oz, my ex was born 6lbs something.  My son was 7lbs 8oz.  Could just be a coincidence.<br>  <br>  My brother and two sisters were all 7lbs 7 or 8oz too.|`|AA10976444	I think that genetics does play a part.  I am 5'8" and heavy...hubby is over 6 ft and 250lbs.  Our forst son was 8lbs4oz and was 24"long...Our second son was 8lbs 8oz and was 22 " long.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	No.  It has more to do with prenatal nutrition than anything else.|`|8WbfmK5daa	In my personal experience I don't think it does.<br>  <br>  If birth weights are similiar to parents I think it is more of  coincidence than anything else, as every person and every pregnancy is completely different.<br>  <br>  I was 9lb 14oz when I was born and my partner was just as massive at 10lb 12oz and our little girl was born on Monday, 4 days late, weighing 6lbs exactly.|`|1485ed10658f5fff9f00587d44259041aa	I think it may influence it, but there are SO many factors.  Just look at the variation between kids within a family.  My husband was 8lbs 12oz at birth and I was 6lbs 8oz.  My son (first born) was 9lbs 10oz at 5 days late.  My daughter (second born) was 6lbs 6oz at 13 days early, but 18 days more cooking wouldn't have made her as heavy as her brother!  I gained 35 with my first and 25 with my second, so that could make a difference, too.  It is probably partially genetics and part diet.  Good luck to you!|`|VCCKfT3taa	All I can tell you is my own experience:<br>  <br>  My mom was a "big baby", I was 10 pounds, my sister was 11, and my daughter was 8 pounds.<br>  <br>  My husband was only around 6 or 7 though, if I recall...<br>  <br>  Then again that's only me.|`|YlLmAADraa	nope, not at all. this woman i know was like a 3lbs baby and she had a 12lbs baby. deffinitly not the same.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	No, I don't think so.|`|irP2yTMWaa	no my daughter 5lb 11oz my boy 8lb 12oz<br>  <br>  me 6lb 10oz my hubby 7lb 12oz|`|AA12300309	nope- don't think so|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	no
a35650a2d4dd8438b175c12703752380aa	Sorry for your loss <br>  first to involve the children would be a good way of saying good bye to their brother allow them to draw a picture or make something for them to give to their brother which will stay with him forever it will be special and tell them he knows that it came from them,allow them to take part in the service and burial to let them see that he is gone but there is also a special place where he will be for everyone to visit ,i know that your children are very young but you'd be surprised what they will be thinking and they will be wanting to ask lots of questions sit them down and it will be hard for both of you but you will be able to talk and ask them what they want to do don't exclude them as they may think that they have done something wrong.<br>  I know that your grief is overwhelming right now and nothing in this world wil take away your pain and you have to keep on going but so is your children's your doctor or family nurse should be able to tell you about all the agency's which will help you all to cope with the loss ,<br>  And for those who say that time is a great healer they are wrong as the loss is with you constantly but you will get through it you'll have good day's and bad days.<br>  Hope that you all get through your coming days an don't be afraid to ask for help even your under taker wil give you great advice ,i know this through the experience of loosing  my son who was stillborn and my two older children were lost and didn't know what was going on so we had to sit down and talk through all the tears and snot and the wanted to give their brother something we also left a few things and they went to the funeral and grave side and i'm glad that this is how we did it for there sake ,|`|tdxurIr9aa	I think it's the hardest thing to lose a child, I would let your children go to the funeral, that way they will see their brother is not coming back, it's an ending, but don't let them forget him.<br>  My heart goes out to you and your family, time is a great healer.|`|2V87n4PKaa	im so sorry you lost your son. but hes in a better place.<br>  i would have your two older kids go to a phycologist, at least for a little while.<br>  ask them if they want to go. if they feel they cant handle it, dont force them.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	God - I am SO sorry for your loss. I would say look for bereavement support groups maybe through the hospital or online for your area. I would probably take the other children to the funeral. it will help with closure. take care -|`|GiMJULi7aa	im very sorry for your loss. My condolences. The best thing to do would be spend as much time with your children as possible, and you should find a good psycologist. For the funeral, I think you should take then just to the ceremony, I think the burial would be to much for them, but maybe you should ask the 7 year old if he wants to go. And again I am very sorry for your loss, hang in there and good luck.|`|QSUg9vNLaa	I'm so, so sorry for your loss.<br>  Maybe your children should see a phycologist.<br>  and they should go to the burial and the funeral, i mean<br>  its they're bother.|`|11mJ0RHhaa	NO COUNCELING, you do not want the children to feel like they have emotional problems, it will put the negetive thought in thier head (especially the 7 yr old)<br>  <br>  I would suggest talking to them about it.<br>  <br>  say something like this...<br>  <br>  Its all natural, He is in a much better place now. He would have been hurt badly if god hadnt taken him now.<br>  <br>  something like that, idk what religion you are but if your christian that will probably comfort him a little.<br>  <br>  Eat as a family for the next month or two and pray for him around the table.<br>  <br>  Take them to the funeral show them that they arnt the only sad ones so that they know its okay to cry<br>  <br>  And live your normal life, dont take them out of school for a LONG TIME, only for a bit they need to be more social, more than ever.<br>  <br>  To sum it up--  Pray, Talk about it, No councelling, Take them to the funeral,Have them in school|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Im so sorry for your lost, Its never easy to lose some one. Especailly a child. I think it would be a good idea of your children and yourself and your husband to go to some kinda of therapy. When a close family friend lost there 4 year old son to cancer they all went to therapy, individual and family. Include them in everything when it comes to his funeral. Ask the 7 and 4 year old if they would like to write there brother a letter ( im guessing the 4 year old and your son are twins) Maybe see if he wants to do something special for him as well. They can either read them at the funeral or just include them with him. Ask your children what they would like to do for there brother in saying goodbye. Again im so sorry.|`|gknPGlDCaa	Im sorry for your loss :( I know that probally means nothing to you but i cant imagine what your going through <br>  I would teach your children about death here and explain where there brother has went the 7 year old may know but the 4 year old might not, it will proablly be worse for them dealing with greif if they dont know whats happened ask them about the funeral, its there own brother they should make the descion even if they are young. dont tell them they not coming and dont push them into it, let them know what happens before asking for theyre desicion. <br>  My heart goes out to you and your family xoxo|`|vlQ8bdF7aa	Im so sorry about your loss. I cant even begin to imagine how u r feeling. When i was nine my sister died, my parents dint allow us to go to her funeral and although im not angry with them for making that decision a always felt it was something i wanted to do so i could say goodbye to her.<br>  I would allow your children to attend the funeral but have someone on standby to tke them home if its to hard for them. <br>  Let them know that the graveyard will be the place to say goodbye but although they wont be able to see their brother agan, they will be able to visit his grave and still talk to him even although they wont b able to aee him.<br>  I wish you and your family all the luck for the future x|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I can't begin to express my sorrow for your loss. Hearing something like that makes me appreciate my children even more and how blessed I am to have them healthy and safe.  You are trying to be too strong...I think it is important for your children to see the reality of your feelings and emotions.  Be human, be real, let it out, they will learn more from that and will learn that it is ok for them to express thier feelings. Enlist any extended family and friends you can to help care for your children so you can be there for them, but be there for yourself and your spouse too.|`|32866571f9996aa9d609f6f782586569aa	My heart goes out to you all.  If it was me I would let the children go to the funeral and the burial as it might make it easier for them to understand.  It would be a good idea for the children to speak to someone who specialises in this.  I think yourself and your husband also need to speak to a bereavement counsellor.  Keep talking to each other and as a family you will remain strong.  Take care of yourselves and god bless
4E2BoVptaa	*HUGS* Sweetie. First of all, let me say that I am sorry that you're having to go through this. Pregnancy is hard enough without the added stress. But, I do have some suggestions. Take the ones that you like and ignore the ones that don't work for you.<br>  <br>  #1) You or your husband can work from home. I know of some ACTUAL jobs online that are fairly easy to get. They're not buy into programs but actual W-4 employment.<br>           -Alpine Access- They hire ppl to run their phone banks for customer service and technical support from home. They pay about 9.50 an hour. You choose your shifts. They do have benefits. I have some friends who do it while they are pregnant and it has been a life saver for them!<br>           - Care.com this site is for child care, senior care, tutoring, and things like that. It's a quick way to get cash coming in fast. You couldn't do it because you're on bed rest, but your husband could. It's an actual job, not something you buy into.<br>          ** I have a few others, if you're interested, let me know**<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Get on state aid. Tragically, some ppl look down on welfare, but you pay taxes your entire life... so if you truly are down on your luck and need some temporary assistance.. then apply for it and use it. That's what it's there for.  You wouldn't feel ashamed to go to the doctor if you had been paying into an insurance place. Welfare is sort of a hard times insurance that you pay with your taxes ever time!<br>  <br>  3. Check into disability and unemployment. If the doctor has put you on bed rest, you qualify for state disability pay (most likely). You husband, unless he was fired most likely qualifies for unemployment. It's not a lot of money, but it helps!!!<br>  <br>  4. Talk to your church. Most churches don't advertise the fact that they financially support people during hard times such as these.. but most churches do have programs designed to help ppl just like you!!! Call your pastor and talk to him. It's a pride swallowing thing, but it will ensure that your bills get paid and food is on your table.<br>  <br>  5. Get enrolled in school. The Spring semester is wrapping up and summer will be starting soon.MOST schools offer online classes, which you could take from bed and MOST schools pay living expenses!! I know that I had to depend on that a few times. Yes, you'll have to pay it back later.. but it's a lifesaver when you need it!!<br>  <br>  ** I truly hope hat one of the five options listed helps you!!!|`|6xwdFvdpaa	im am sorry to hear this babe but you really need to try and stay calm, i know this will be difficult and i know its hard for you especailly being pregnant has well, you need to clam benefits if you can plus you will get alot of help if you can do this as you will recieve a ￡500 for being pregnant if you are in england,<br>  just remember that you still have each other at the end of the day and you both will be able to get through this hard time, just stay strong for eachother and try and stay positive i wish you all the best hun x|`|T48smu01aa	well for one hummy things will be okay don't worry and don't stress god will take it under his arms as long as you believe....second you husband should be able to qualify for unemployment so he should file as soon as possible. you can ask your doctor for a note and you can actually go on disability if your already not so you don't have to stress about work.....do lil things like sign up for WIC and stuff like that don't be ashamed either some many people are in this situation so don't thinkn your the only one....be happy things will work out....just be grateful you will get to keep your child and it will be healthy and you have a roof over you head to keep you uys warm and safe....and just budget :) it will work out I promise :)<br>  Good luck sweetie and congrats!!
s4LWmcTjaa	I don't believe moms who put their kids in daycare are bad mothers at all.  If you need to work, then you need to work.  Simple as that.<br>  <br>  But that being said I do think it's ideal for kids to be cared for by one of their parents.  I know it's not always possible, but it's the ideal scenario.<br>  <br>  I think daycare has it's good points, but think of this:<br>  <br>  1- In daycare, kids don't get that one on one attention and interaction with their care givers.  As a stay at home mom, I get to spend more time teaching my kids and giving them more attention and I'm very in tune with their needs.<br>  <br>  2- Yes I do agree that day care can be wonderful for learning social skills and interacting with other kids, but they can interact with other kids and learn social skills through play dates as well.  They also learn social skills with spending time with me.<br>  <br>  3- Staying at home with them allows me to model what a home life should be like and how to learn basic skills for caring for the home.  I'm showing them how a wife (or husband if my husband is home) plays certain roles in the family.  My kids are learning how to do basic things around the house and learning how a mom (or dad) is supposed to be interacting with their children.<br>  <br>  To me those reasons above are good enough reasons for me to stay home with my kids if I have that option.  I want to be home when they leave for school and be home when they come home.  You never know how much of an impact things like that can have on a child.<br>  <br>  But I still believe that if you have to work, then that does not make you any less of a mom.  It just means your schedule is different than mine :)  I recognize that some parents just don't have a choice.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Depends on why. If you don't have to and you choose to I think you are a bit of an idiot and probably sort of lazy. But I understand circumstances where you have to. "Socialization" is a pretty word for giving your child to someone else to look after. You can "socialize" your child yourself if you care enough to make the effort.<br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  Texas momma, you answered that perfectly. That is how I see it.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i don't think it is bad if you work, or just need a little break through out the week. but if your neglecting  it just so you can go drink or something that is wrong|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I am sorry but when I read the part about "luxury" I stopped reading!  I have sacrificed a lot to stay home and raise my daughter so luxury has nothing to do with it!  I cant imagine missing out on so much  of my daughters life.  As far as the interacting with children goes I have at least 15 other stay at home Mom friends with kids my daughters age that she sees weekly, we go to the park almost daily, we have a Mommy & Me meeting once a week and we also have a Mommy & Me sign language class baby massage class and with summer coming up a swimming class!  She gets tons of interaction with other kids!!!!  <br>  <br>  I have no problem with parents who put their kids in day care.  Everybody has to make their own choices for their children..........I would just never do it and its my right to feel the way I do about day  care!  Like I said before we have sacrificed a lot for our family to live off one income.  I would not change it for the world!  I have not missed out on one minute of my daughters life.<br>  <br>  Nobody is right or wrong weather you stay at home or work you can still be a good parent.  I have never heard of somebody saying a working parent is "un fit" I have just heard people bash Mom's who  don't raise their own kids.  Its like the breast vs. bottle battle people are just very passionte about being stay at home Mom's!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Most day cares don't teach those skills to the kids. They say they do but they don't have the time to teach in the one on ones like you would want. I think you have the right idea with a mix of things to promote the social skills and the stay at home to teach the skills kids need to succeed. I have seen both stay at home and daycare kids turn out bad and good. It really comes back to the parents in the end.|`|VHHis05Naa	No, I do not.  I wouldn't dream of judging another mother for a choice they made that was best for their family.  I don't walk in their shoes and I think motherhood is a tough job regardless of what you choose.  My daughter is in pre-school in the mornings and LOVES it.  She has friends there and has learned so much.  She used to be very clingy to me and has now learned that doing things on her own is fun!   The women who look after my child during that time are so caring and my daughter loves them...actually loves them!  I don't see what is so wrong about letting other people into your child's life to make their world a little bigger.  It's not the same as daycare, since she only goes for three hours a day, but still.<br>  <br>  The only mothers I judge are those who harm their children either with neglect or abuse.  How the heck could I assume I know what is best for someone else's family?  I don't!  I know what's best for mine, and I'm sure someone out there disagrees with that.  OH WELL!|`|a8IRxC4raa	I don't think mothers (and fathers) who use daycare are bad parents.<br>  <br>  OTOH, kids learn to socialize, to share, to wait their turn, to raise their hands, etc, just fine without daycare.  It's a personal decision.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|mZ3jta2daa	No i do not think it is makes people a bad mother. Mothers need breaks to even if they are a SAHM|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think anyone who would call a parent who puts their children in day care a 'bad parent' is an idiot and apparently have never had to struggle for things in their lives. i think when it comes down to it most people be it mothers or fathers would love to stay at home with their kids but like you said it's just not possible. for someone to judge some one else's parenting skills solely on the fact that a child is in day care is a complete jack a**!  and i am a stay at home mom so i don't want anyone thinking that i am defending my own choices because i am not. i couldn't imagine going to work all day, being away from my children to come home and have a ton of house work, dinner to put on the table and kids to look after so i say any parent that goes to work needs to be commended and NOT put down. everyone whether they stay at home or go to work ...works hard and others need to respect that. there are plenty of parents who do stay at home and still don't take care of their children properly but no one calls them a bad parent? give me a break. parenting and whether you are good or bad at it should be based on the child. if the child is happy, healthy and well cared for THAT are the ONLY things that should matter. every parent has to make the right choices for them and their families. and most times those choices are extremely difficult... people need to respect that.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Well, I'm not classified in the single mother or low income bracket. But, I know that when the time comes I want my kids to go to daycare, at least part time, so that my kids can see me being passionate about other areas in my life. My kids will know they are more important to me than anything, but for me, it's going to be a matter of needing to interact with adults in my career of choice. I know I won't be completely happy staying home with my kids full time. I'd feel like I was missing out on my passion for work and then feel like I was cheating my kids of my complete and utter happiness. I figure as long as I'm aware of that and am doing what it takes for me to be happy, my kids will be happier, too, because I am. Not to mention, they'll be prepared really well for school. I respect mothers who can stay home--it's often physically and emotionally exhausting, and it takes a lot of willpower. I also respect those mothers who work full time to provide for their families and have their kids in daycare. It takes more than staying home to make a family unit complete and fulfilled. It also takes more than the appearance of a good family unit that sends their kids to daycare while the parents work if there's no communication and love there and everyone's stressed all the time. It's all about finding the balance that works for your family. What works for me and my family may fail miserably if implemented in my neighbor's home.|`|3dSCbIcEaa	I dont think they r bad parents...i think people that beat and starve their kids r bad parents.  I understand that it isnt always possible to stay at home and i think that daycare is great for their education, and social skills.  It bugs me though when people say they have no choice but they have two car payments, a brand new house, cable t.v. etc.  They do have a choice, they could move into an apartment, buy cheaper vehicles, and spend time with their kid, if that is whats important to them.  But if that is not whats important to them, and all the stuff is, it is their choice. it just bugs that they use the excuse that they have no choice.  Another thing that irks me is when moms bring their newborn babies in.  It is so sad for those babies, i've seen how a few daycares work, and it seemed to me that they were just warehousing the kids.  Do parents believe that the daycare will care for their baby as good as they will as the parents?  Do they think the daycare workers who earn minimum wage will love and attend to the baby the way a mother would?  I know other people literally have no choice like single moms etc and for them i understand that daycare is neccessary.<br>  Just to point out:no i dont think they r bad mothers, at least they arent abandoning their kids at home while they go to work|`|SrcoG7JRaa	I'm a working mom and I think SAHMs who want to confine us to our homes all day are totally out of touch with reality and with the modern world.<br>  Women work now. We have a choice, and if it's your choice to be a SAHM, that's dandy for you, but I also have a choice to be a working mom, and I'm sick of getting crap for it unprovoked. The people who think they have a right to tell me that working is being abusive and I should sit around at home all day are the kinds of people who want to set us back 150 years - before we had a choice. I choose to work, you choose to be at home; let it be.<br>  <br>  I have 3 kids and admittedly, none go to daycare. They come to work with me and the elder two are homeschooled. If I had a regular job, they'd be in school or daycare and I wouldn't have any problem with it.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I am a stay at home mom but I don't think that people who put their kids in daycare are bad parents. We struggle on one income and it is horrible sometimes but we just bearly make it. I feel very lucky. It isn't anyones fault that they have to work. The economy is so bad right now it makes it darn near impossible to live off of one income. I applaud the mothers who go to work each day and come home to take care of their homes and children each night. It isn't easy to stay at home all of the time, but it is't easy for those who have to work all day and then come home and have to take care of things either. No one should criticize either form of parenting as long as they are involved in their child's life and are doing everything in their power to bring them up right.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I think it ridiculous and extreme to call a mother unfit or label her a "bad" mother because she works and has her children in daycare. <br>  Financial circumstances mean that some mothers are not in a position where they can stay home and raise their children. Many European countries have PAID maternity leave in which the mother can stay home for 1 or even 2 years. In Australia, most business and companies have to offer three months paid maternity and a year of unpaid maternity. I am a stay-at-home mum because I can afford to stay at home,although there are a few financial sacrifices, being able to be with my son 24/7 is worth the financial/material sacrifices. <br>  I'm not attacking any mother, but personally, I don't understand why a mother who could afford to stay at home with her infant, would instead decide to return to work. Or why, if you knew you could not afford to stay at home more than 6 weeks, you would make the choice to have a child, knowing that a stranger was going to be the primary caregiver of your baby. I think, for at least the first 12 months, mothers should do all they can to stay at home as much as possible with their infants.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter goes to daycare! and i dont care if that in ome peoples eyes makes me a bad parent...i know im not i know by working im doing whats best for my child and id rather that than struggle on benefits. some people are to ignorant to see the bigger picture! MY DAUGHTER IS IN DAYCARE AND LOOOVES IT! yes i put her there....handcuff me now and send me to mommy jail;))))))))|`|UwwNpgntaa	well it depends if they are working mohers then definitely no theyre not bad mothers bcuz u knw their also doing it for their kids. whats bad is if they are hella rich and dnt need to work and they leave their kids in daycare just so they could shop or hang with their friends|`|dVAiuqZCaa	I would love to stay home and be with my kids,but they would go hungry.Would that make me a better mom?I don't think so.I have no choice but to work.Those people should mind their own bussiness!|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	My sister goes to daycare because she 6 years old in kindergarten she just had her B-day.She gets out at 11:40.I am 11 and my mom was going to put me in daycare but she saw it was  not suitable for me.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Daycare for children is fine if needed because parents are working...sending them there when you are a stay at home mom is wrong.  They do not need that learning you are talking about, they will learn it just fine by you teaching them and when they get to school age.  It is much more important to be home with your children and raising them and not having someone else do it. working women is one of the main downfalls of the family unit.  I understnad that financially most women need to work ( I've been there too) so it is understandable if the kids are in daycare, but if you have the choice to not work and stay at home then you should keep your kids wiht you everyday unless there is something important you have to do and need to put your child in the daycare.|`|hiMO0dzKaa	I think this is an issue that will continue for all time.  There is no one answer or no one best solution.  I truly don't believe its about staying at home or daycare.  Its about the quality of time spent with your kids and the morality you instill in them-regardless of who is watching them. I work in criminal law and the odd thing is....a huge majority of my criminal clients had stay at home moms.  But what does that mean exactly?  Doesn't mean they were given a lot of attention and it doesn't mean they were with their mothers 24/7. Being at home with mom is NOT always the best answer if that time is more quantity than quality. Not all mothers are capable of being SAHM's and that's ok. I really think it comes down to the quality of care your child receives and the quality time spent with mom & dad. If being a SAHM fits the bill then great!  If not, quality child care is out there and that's just fine too.|`|peQGGFPYaa	I think it is extremely wrong for people to say that working mothers are bad parents. Not everyone can stay home with their kids! I stay home because i have two kids and it would be just as expensive as any check i would get from any job so either work and use the check to pay for daycare and thats it or just stay home. so i stay home with my kids i love it but i think its wrong to say that if you work you are a bad parent. just like i think its wrong of working moms to say staying at home is easy, because it isn't, you never get a break from the monotony! Who knows you could be a SAHM and be the worst parent in the world!
JvM44Bx5aa	I would recommend Graco Passage Travel System, Abbington.<br>  <br>  It is a lightweight, affordable stroller which will provide your baby comfort, safety and the most secure way to travel, with a double infant head support.<br>  <br>  The price is only $199.98.   It includes a three-piece set which is a passage stroller, Snugride infant car seat and a stay-in-car adjustable base. <br>  <br>  You may see more details at the following on line store:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/graco-jogging-strollers-20/detail/B001PUEVGS" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/graco-jogging-s...</a><br>  <br>  Congratulation!|`|PxvRob35aa	HI. We have four kids and think bought Graco for the last two. We buy the three wheeler version as we live in the country but also its easy to push round towns. They can be smaller than others but to us thats a plus. When buying any pushchair make sure it fits in your boot!! I bought one that was too long. Argh! But the Graco is a Fantastic budget travel system. Amazing what you get for your money. The base is really useful as you just pop the car seat on it then transfer it straight onto the pram. Of course they are safe dont worry about that. The only minus is the hard wheels as it can be a bit bumpy but day to day shopping etc should be ok. To be honest we got a second hand 3 wheeler too, with tyres and got endless punctures so that eliminates that. <br>  I think people can be snobby, but for your budget, a sensible one, go for it.<br>  Good luck with the birth.<br>  P.S Babies R us are usually cheapest or have offers on. Shop around.<br>  Same product, different prices.|`|2bk7RL0Kaa	In our experience these tend to be too heavy. Loola is very good because you can have your toddler face YOU a bit later on. (With Graco they can only face forward.) Loola is also lighter and more compact - fits into a smaller car when folded up. I have no idea how much it costs but it is definitely worth it.
LZ4QYrPXaa	my son was about 10 an half months. so i think i was pretty lucky! <br>  he started taking it at 10.00am for an hour after getting up at 7am so by 4 he was grumpy so i kept him awake a bit longer on a morning so now he goes down around 11.00/11.30 and aleeps for an hour an half and he is fine when he wakes up! <br>  <br>  I suppose they just do it when they are ready xx|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	My son seemed to move to 1 nap a day when he was 15 months. He kept it up for almost a month, but no he's fluctuating between one nap and two, depending on the day. He's having some terrible teething-related problems at the moment, though, so don't know if that's affecting him wanting to sleep a bit more?|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	my daughter was 2 weeks old when she gave up sleeping during the day, she would go to sleep about 11pm until 7am from she was 2 weeks old, she is now 29 years old, she has 2 kids the youngest 2yr 4m and she stopped sleeping during the day a few months ago but she knows when the night garden finishes at 7pm its time for cot, she occasionally has 45min sleep in the afternoon but upsets her bedtime routine.|`|8zXiqIK0aa	bout 9 - 10 months ish. <br>  x|`|ppG2smDWaa	1 1/2 years old|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Around 2 for all of ours.  Now that I've hit my 50's, I'm back to one nap a day myself.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Very early.  My son has napped consistently once a day from about 3-4 months old.
hqPaGhBoaa	Did he just start doing that after the accident, or was he always like that?<br>  <br>  If he just started doing it after the accident, I would def. sit down and talk with him about how you would never leave him anywhere and that he doesn't have to worry about stuff like that. It may just take some time for him to get back to the way he was...that wont last that much longer if he keeps getting reassurance. You may even have to have that talk more than a few times.<br>  <br>  Otherwise if he has always been like that there may be some kind of other problem that is going on that may need to be addressed by a physician.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  Also...I was a childcare worker for 3 years and it is always better to just tell your son that you will pick him up when you get off work, and then give him a hug and tell him you love him and just leave. Parents that linger around and try to get their child to stop crying make the crying last way longer than it ever does otherwise. His teacher should be able to get him involved in something and diffuse the situation pretty quickly. Never ever sneak out of the room to avoid the crying..that will make it worse.<br>  <br>  Don't feel like a bad father, you aren't, obviously you care alot. Seperation anxiety is very very common for that age, and it will get better.|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	That definitely would be the cause of his clingyness. If children are clingy, the best thing to do would be to take them places like the local Y or something and tell them that you are going to be right back in an hour or so. That will get them used to being away from you, and they will have some fun too! Also, sometimes you have to let them cry, no matter how bad it might hurt....(I hate to see kids cry too!)
uB4ZQOEDaa	I think it's fantastic that your partner is planning t stay at home with baby.  However I think you are probably planning way to much - Your whole planning system will probably go to plot when baby arrives anyway.  My mum always says "if you wait till you can afford to have a baby then you never will"  - just go with the flow and see how motherhood suits you .  i wish you and you're partner every happiness.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	You get a full year of maternity leave, 9 months of this paid. Not usually in full but usually around 90%. So you shouldn't really need to return until 6 months after the baby or later. If you worked right up to the baby was born you could have the first 9 months of his/her life with the baby without suffering too much financially as you will still be getting maternity pay at the majority of your normal pay. I wouldn't advise going back before 6 months though!|`|WPI0Z47saa	No one can answer that but you and you may not even know until after the baby arives. You have o go with the flow alot of times when you have kids. It is nice to plan things in advance, but you will learn very quickly how fast plans change once children are in the picture. You have to stay flexible. Good luck.|`|Wpmkdwvtaa	6 weeks vaginal birth 8 weeks c section is what doctor recommends my doctor gave me ten weeks but i would save enough money for 8 weeks plus the week or two you return to work before you get your first paycheck again.!! Its better to be safe then sorry and do not forget to add the newborn babys finance's in as well diapers, formula, all the good stuff!! Good luck and im a planning freak too its a bit tougher on you cause dad is staying at home my situation is different my husband works and so do i so we still have his income rolling in and im on temp disability while on maternity leave so its still some sort of income!!|`|i4I0cuudaa	Take as much time with your baby as you can afford to.|`|5c500787631901c9ca4d11eaca666897aa	As a fellow planning freak, I can relate! I gave birth 8 weeks ago and my planning from conception has paid off. Being prepared really takes a load off from having things to worry about when your getting no sleep and have no time to do anything! <br>  If your lucky enough to have a full year of matenity leave you probably aren't in the US and/or are very lucky! The rest of us have to use accumulated vacation/sick time. If you are in the US you may be protected under FMLA (if you've been at ur job for a year and it has more than 50 employees-your covered). That means your elgible for up to 12 weeks of time off (unpaid unfortunately). But what you might  not be aware of, you dont have to take the full 12 weeks concurrently. What I did was take the first full 8 weeks off, and will work half weeks until the 12 week mark.  If you use it intermittently like that you can continue to work part time so you have some income coming in. Also look into short term disability if your job offers it, if you enroll before or early in your pregnancy you'll be elgible for benefits after delivery, that'll give you some cash flow as well. <br>  <br>  Another thing that can factor in how long you're off is if you're planning on breastfeeding. If you are and want to continue after you return to work, it's recommended not to give baby a bottle until 5 weeks to avoid nipple confusion. But you can start pumping to build up a supply right away and then be ready to go back to work at the 5 week mark. <br>  <br>  Good luck in all your planning, and although a lot of it does go right out the window when baby comes, most of it is nice to have arranged for beforehand to make less stress on you!.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	It took be 3 years of trying before I conceived, and didn't return to work until my daughter was at school and then i worked part time school hours, I am of the older generation and I believe its the mothers place to stay at home with the baby as for finances if you are in the uk you get maternity benefit for 1 year after birth, its about ￡100 per week, when you return to work you only need to work 16 hours per week and you claim working tax credit which is about ￡100 per week - it is worked out on the previous 2 years income, why cant he work and you stay at home. If you are in the UK go to the website - Entitled to and it works out what you would get.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	this is something that will be entirely up to hun<br>  <br>  no one on here can say as you have no idea what life will be like after you have your baby <br>  <br>  you may feel like this now but once baby is born you might have a complete change of mind<br>  <br>  and you never know what yours and your baby's health will be like after you will have to wait and see im afraid|`|B5MDTdtPaa	stay off for as long as you can afford maternity pay/until it runs out if you can afford :)
OI3bf4yjaa	It sounds like any temper tantrum. My daughter is 7 months and she bangs her head off the floor purposely when she's angry! She also flings herself backwards.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Yup...and it only gets worse ) =|`|SaX09eNtaa	Wow...finally someone in my shoes!!  My daughter is 11 months old and she does the same thing!!  She will throw herself back, throw whatever she may be holding, and flail her arms.  Honestly she started this a few months ago, and the first time she did it, I basically got wide eyed and kinda had to laugh, cause I was thinking, OMG what was that!  I have googled this same question before wondering if this was typical considering that my son, who is now 10, NEVER did that.  At least not until he was about 2.  And...believe it or not, most of everything I found pointed to little girls doing it!! Wow so our daughters ARE hormonal even as babies!! LOL.  I just try to ignore it, I want to laugh (she doesn't do it alot) so I turn away, so she doesn't see me.|`|Ym7H3x49aa	You need to give her a good slapping.
6QXmeaiJaa	I brought a couple of things after my 12 week scan and then when I had my next scan at 21 weeks and found out what I was having, then thats when I really started to buy things, But my advice to any expectant woman is only but what you need, i.e a couple of baby grows, nappies, creams and an outfit to come out of hospital as so many people will buy stuff that they will grow out of before they have even worn it.|`|a6884b4116269b3d1288c76d227f8f70aa	Hello.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Firstly congrats on your pregnancy :)<br>  <br>  I started buying the non bulky things from about 12 weeks bits of nappies and clothes... im almost 30 weeks now and ive just got my pram and monitor to get...<br>  The real answer is get things when you want to get them.... <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and ur family<br>  <br>  xx|`|385e84e81fffdd40bacfb06c4579774aaa	ive always started the minute i find out the sex lol|`|35fbf16abade59a8f36febbe3ffae540aa	after the 20 week scan.alot can and does go wrong.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I didnt buy anything until a month before my so came home from the hospital, i wouldve been about 36 weeks then|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	About 4 weeks before the due date.|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	i'm 18 weeks tomorrow and i've already got a stroller and car seat. i'm getting the bassinet next weekend. and hopefully the crib by the 20th. it's always a good idea to start planning the nursery. especially because the farther you get, the more tired you get. i'll be getting decorations during my 5th - 7th month too.<br>  <br>  whenever you feel like it go ahead and start. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|758cDKEFaa	i waited till after my 20 week scan and i knew that my baby was healthy and what i was having.<br>  i ordered my pram at 20 weeks cos it takes 14 weeks to be made and delivered then at 28 weeks we got the nursery ready.<br>  by 35 weeks we made sure everything was ready in case the baby came early - which he did!<br>  this time round ive bought a couple blankets and sleepsuits but i have my 20 week scan on te 18th so ill buy loads more things then!|`|4x5ajsUpaa	To be honest once I was past the 12 week mark I started buying little things like sleepsuits and mits but I think I was around 22 weeks when I started to get the bigger stuff.<br>  I was lucky though because I got my sisters pram which was like new as she hardly used it for her little one, I also got her cot.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	i started buying some clothes around 13 weeks. im 24 weeks now and im going to start buying the more essential tings like cots and bottles just to have everything ready when the baby comes.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I'm will be 13 weeks on Tuesday & I already have a few sleepers & onesies... I also bought a Bumbo Chair and we already bought all the nursery furniature (we got a really good deal on a Crib/Dresser/Chaging table set)... We've picked up some odds and ends like cute picture frames for baby's room and cute little decorative things. I'm going to wait until after my baby shower later on during the summer before I buy anything else. I"ll just see what I need after the shower :)|`|58G7ZAJpaa	My husband and I started doing some shopping not too long after we found out.  (he was being deployed around the 16wk mark).  We bought the crib, and some neutral things.  After we found out the sex we buy things separately now. He orders online, and I go to the store to pick things out.  I'm 29 weeks, and our son's nursery is almost complete with the furniture and such.  I wanted to get the big things out of the way before I got TOO big since I have to do it alone!!  We're hoping to be near complete within a month of the arrival, so I can relax and get some rest.<br>  <br>  You can shop whenever you'd like.  There's NO going wrong in that.  I was actually advised through Yahoo Answers to do so, because I was concerned that I was going shopping too soon.  <br>  <br>  Go shop!  Baby stuff is FUN!!|`|f6391b0b92f0565b5a109f16dc70afdfaa	I'm 19 weeks pregnant with my #2. So far I got my travel system. I only bought it in advance cos when u buy on the internet it takes about 3 weeks to get it delivered plus is a tandem and I wasnt sure if it was the right choice and returning would have ment another 3 week wait for another one to come through. <br>  <br>  Once I have my second scan and everything is fine I will prepare my hospital bag and start buying bits and bops. I think I will get da crib/cot 2 months prior. U never know if they wanna come early. <br>  <br>  <br>  I like to spread my shopping so I don't panic towards the end and I am not hit by a massive bill. <br>  <br>  I live in a one bedroom flat so I dont have a nursery to get done but if I had a bigger house I would definately start looking around for furniture and find the best deal.<br>  <br>  Choose what's best for ur needs.<br>  <br>  Gud luck!|`|Ri2I8Ofuaa	hey i have a few little things just clothing and im 12 wks on monday =) i think its best to start earlie just buy a few things each week. its really hard to resist buying!!! i had a dream about a baby bath and i "need" to get one now lol  xxx|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	Im 26 weeks and not buying anything yet.

OCMq6FTdaa	if your willing i would say go for it, if she is truly unhappy. people say things like 'let them tough it out..." i remember having a misrable time in 6th grade, and after a lot of talks w/my parents that summer they put me in a privet school for 2 years, 2 of the best years ever.|`|Lor20kXcaa	In the UK, no it's not a good thing.<br>  <br>  In some regions of the USA, they have home-school kind of classes, where the children meet and socialise with others of their age group.<br>  There are no things like that in the UK, so your daughter would not really meet children of her own age.<br>  <br>  Personally, i think that a lot of home-schooled children miss out on a lot of social skills, simply because they are not at school. <br>  How are they going to learn basic school yard politics, how to talk to some people without offending someone else, how to deal with a belying teacher, how to settle and resolve arguments between friends etc.<br>  <br>  Please, find a good councellor to talk to your daughter. It may just be a small argument that blows over, or she may be truly unhappy, or being bullied.<br>  <br>  Switching schools is a far better idea than homeschooling, for her social skills and life.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	To find out the rules and regulations regarding homeschooling, I suggest you visit this site: <a href="http://www.HSLDA.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.HSLDA.org</a> and find the link for England.  There will probably be links to associations and organizations near you that can help you, too.<br>  <br>  Homeschooling has been a WONDERFUL experience for our family.  And, though I have not read the other answers yet I am sure there are, or if not there will be soon, some suggesting it causes people to be social outcasts.  School is not the only, and it is definitely not the best, place to socialize.<br>  <br>  I wish I could give you more information, but I am in the U.S.A. and I am sure the process is a little different here.  I wish you the best, though!|`|2V87n4PKaa	if you take her out of school its juts going to get worse.<br>  whats going to happen when she goes to colledge? she cant be homeschooled for that.<br>  have her continue going to school, and have her have regular meetings with a counseler|`|FvhCUHjxaa	I wouldn't do it unless you know somebody who is certified in home school and has a college degree in some sort of teaching. It is easy to withdraw her from school and you can remove her whenever you feel it's necessary. I am against home schooling unless the parent has been through significant training to teach their child, I know too many people who are socially and academically behind their peers due to home schooling, but if you do it correctly, there shouldn't be a problem.

A purple one for my little girl born Dec 16th 2008.  So she is not even quite 3 monthes.  She is only 11 pounds right now.  She is doing great in it and loves to be feed in it and likes to just hang in it.  Granted I watch her like a hawk because she is so small.  There is definitely  a pinch of slouching going on.  She doesn't look uncomfortable.  I put her next to some hanging toys she can swat at.  I think this one of those when the body is ready to be able to sit up comfortabley then you will know it.  He is not ready just yet but probably very close.  Every human is a bit different and we all grow up at our speed.

But it depends on sales; sometimes one store might have better sales than another.<br>  <br>  Also, craigslist or freecycle.org or ebay are good places to get baby stuff sometimes.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Walmart.|`|HIRYscJlaa	proabably Kmart or Walmart, definately not babies r us they are expensive|`|gEyCvH1kaa	i say walmart and target is about the same.. i go to both for diff varieties to get all my baby stuff
3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Go into business for yourself. Ask your neighbors if there is anything you could do that they will pay you for doing.<br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|0Kw2yVp4aa	i was 13 and i was working i could only work in the summer but w.e i worked at a tots camp just look online and talk to people that u know if there are willing to pay for ur services.|`|nwZ1ZtRbaa	Some places won't let you get a job at 15. You might wanna check out the laws in your area. When teens get jobs it's usually at grocery/clothing stores or restaurants/fast food places. Just go in and ask if they're hiring and if they are ask for an application to fill out and give back to them. Sometimes they'll give you an application even if they're not hiring, some places are always accepting applications. And it's good to call back after a few days to check the status of your application. If you can't get a job there's things you can do for people like mowing lawns, babysitting, etc. Good luck.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	In some places, you can. Where I live, you must be 16, but in other states it is 15. First, you should ask the minimum age you must be. Usually the places you can work are grocery stores and sometimes fast food. You ask for the job application and fill it out and return it.<br>  <br>  Just a warning though- you won't make "fast money."|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Considering that more than 4 million qualified adults in the US are unemployed, good luck. <br>  You'll definitely need a work permit though. <br>  <br>  And no job you're going to get will give you 'fast money". Minimum wage jobs are more like slave labor.|`|AA11784984	I most states with a work permit I believe you can work.|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	States have a minimun age for children in workplace, with exceptions for relatives.  In MN it's sixteen.  But don't let that discourage you.  Start hiring out for odd jobs.  You'd be amazed how fast money can add up.  When I was a kid I - mowed grass, shoveled snow, threw hay bales, cut/split/stacked firewood, washed cars, umpired youth baseball, tended blocklayers, looked after houses when the owner was away, babysat,  the list is only limited by your imagination.  Times are a little tough right now, but you'd be surprised how lazy people can be.  What doesn't seem like a lot of money to them is a windfall for you.  In case this seems like a stupid answer, I bought my first car at fourteen, and had it all fixed up by my sixteenth birthday.  Good luck.|`|5iQO45ZNaa	yes you can get a job but you cants work at the cash register untill your at least 16. <br>  you can get a job pretty much anywhere they will hire you. ex. fast food resturanst, clothing stores and grocery stores<br>  you go in and ask if you can apply for a job or have a job application|`|Uup8eypsaa	yes, you can get a job.<br>  you can only get a job at certain places and working with certain things (i.e. a grocery store, running cashier or mopping isles)<br>  and you have to get working papers, then go to the place of interest and apply for a job with the manager.|`|clZNh1VWaa	i had a dishwashing job at a restaurant at that age, it was under the table so... but people are cracking down these days, but that would be your best bet.
8kaDm2D8aa	i've been looking all over for that too, it's called a folded diaper cake.  these are the only instructions i can find.<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2116265_easy-diaper-cake.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2116265_easy-dia...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.alexandersplayroom.com/pc/ARTHTMDC/ZZART/How+To+Make+A+Diaper+Cake.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexandersplayroom.com/pc/ART...</a>|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	you tube has a bunch of vids to help.|`|1485ed10658f5fff9f00587d44259041aa	I found really great directions on YouTube when I made one not long ago.  I received the one with the fanned out diapers as you are describing, from an expensive online company as a gift, and just used that to help me.  I made a cake that was partially rolled, but the outside was fanned, and it looked great and was sturdy.  Here's what I did:<br>  <br>  Use an 8oz bottle for the center.  I rolled about 7 diapers, rubber band around each, then placed the rolled diapers around the bottle.  I put a big rubber band around that.  Then, I took the diapers in a stack, and spaced them out around the rolled diapers until it looked right and as full as I wanted it.  I secured it with a big rubber band, then went over the rubber band with a ribbon.  I then rolled enough diapers to go around the top of the 8oz bottle and added the fanned out diapers, but I didn't put as many in, as to make a skinnier layer.  For the top, I put a 4oz bottle (it will go right on top of the 8oz, coming together in the middle of the middle layer).  I went around that with some rolled diapers and then fanned out around that with very few diapers.  I folded receiving blankets around each layer and added "goodies".  It turned out really great. <br>  <br>  I think if you watch the YouTube videos (most are of the rolled cake, but you can find a couple with the fanned cake) you will get a pretty good idea of how to do it.  Just play around with it.  It wasn't that hard to do, and I actually had fun.  :)  I have directions on how I made mine, but it's on my school laptop which I won't have access to until Monday.  I'd be willing to e-mail them to you if you'd like so you can make my combo cake.  Good luck and have fun!
5h8bYsKdaa	it could be both. i start to show around 15 weeks too but i also notice it could be from food and constipation.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	I started showing very early and definitely had a bump by 15 weeks. I liked to eat too and with my first I gained 70 pounds! This time around I am trying to be good about what I eat and hopefully won't gain too much. Good luck and Congrats!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	By 15 weeks you would start to show a bit so sounds normal to me.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	<a href="http://www.gurgle.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.gurgle.co.uk</a>|`|fHgbL046aa	I'm 22 weeks pregnant. I was 153 pounds before getting pregnant, but I lost 6 pounds when I found out I was pregnant and gained 1 pound back. My stomach looks fat and squishy. I don't have a pretty baby belly and wonder if I will. With my first pregnancy I was thinner and started showing around 6 months. I had a nice pretty bump. I haven't even felt my baby move yet.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	its probably the baby. when my stomach started to get harder that's when it started to show :) congrats
nlteggWIaa	i thought when you get married you were meant to tell each other everything ,and i think i would be very upset if you hadn't told me there could of been something wrong with his child and plus he would of been there for you so you could of talked about it and not kept it to yourself stressing . but on the other hand i can see why you didn't tell him , just be honest don't keep these things to yourself stress is not good for you or the baby|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	I've never even heard of a "soft marker' sorry. If your dr said not to worry than I wouldn't.<br>  I wish I could be more helpful. Hopefully you'll get some informative answers.<br>  I'm sure everything will be fine. Good Luck!
MHOxPs8Oaa	Well I know from babysitting I would always eat the person's food.  But I would always clean up my mess and usually if the kid was taking a nap I would clean up the house because I was bored.  I would be mad if that happened. So yes you did the right thing. Why on earth would you pay them both $8 a hour to begin with though?|`|PH3vvbrdaa	course u did the rite thing i wouldve paid them even less good 4 u!|`|UA8zGGTsaa	That's just ridiculous. You didn't overreact, I would have screamed and never hired them again! Babysitters are teens trying to show the world that they can be responsible, not to come to people's houses and act like a 2 year old!|`|Jucak0HLaa	I think that is perfectly fine.I babysit,and am 15,but I would never leave the house like that.I always make sure to clean up after,and I follow the parents rules.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Of course it was rude what they did, but I think it was unfair to cut their pay.<br>  After all, you hired them as sitters, not cleaners.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes, that is okay. did you grant them permission to even help themselves ?|`|ko3Larigaa	Oh my gosh. I babysit for my neighbors and Im 14 years old and I would never do that to someones house and if the kids decided they would make a mess I clean it up after them. <br>  <br>  And I wouldnt use them again because what they did was wrong I think you shoudl have went back to $4 dollars because of what they did that wasnt right. <br>  <br>  But you really didnt overreact. you did the right thing. Most parents I know wouldnt do that. I hope you find more good babysitters. =)|`|yzakyjNKaa	in my opinion  they got more then they deserved me when i babysit i make sure it looks better then it did when they left  and expect that when i have a baby sitter  for my kids|`|rBq189W1aa	They're lucky you paid them at all. There's no reason they should be making the house any untidier than it was before you left. I take it you won't be hiring these girls again?|`|2V87n4PKaa	you did the right thing<br>  those girls should have enough respect to keep the house neat|`|qissG2T1aa	Yes ,you do the right thing and you're to kinds for them
GIlTkQu6aa	hey Demetre remember me?<br>  i think it is getting a little too out of hand. i saw all your ?s. im thinking 3 things. 1, you and your family need a family councilor, 2 it might be your over exaggerating or lying, or your house is chaotic. if your not lying than please PLEASE get a babysitter while your at work. why is there so much violence? i don't think spanking is working anymore or your not spanking them correctly. first you need to calm yourself and your brother. then have a talk about why he is getting spanked and why he is doing that ect. then you spank him, not enough so it scars him but just enough so it will make him cry for about 5 min. you were right with spanking him but you need to do it correctly and i don't want you being sad. you are supposed to not want to hit your kids. i feel bad for you guys and you're in my prayers. you NEED a family talk on hitting|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes you should take her to get looked at. Your not a bad parent, you are trying your best but I suggest that you look into some options of help. I do not think it is a good idea for them to be home without supervision!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Dude. Seriously.<br>  If you are this obsessed with spanking, go a forum. You can google them. I am sure you will find what you need.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	yes take her there.....and call social services for help! i mean jees this is not right at all. beating his sis like that is really not good..if it is the truth.....|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you need to figure out a different way to take care of these kids. if this kind of stuff keeps up they are going to take them away from you. your brother needs some SERIOUS help. and your sister needs to be taken to the ER. i can't believe you would feel bad for spanking your brother. especially after what he did to your sister. you need to get some help in the house whether its counseling a family member SOMETHING. if you leave it like this someone is going to end up dead or in foster care.|`|d36OrpbDaa	it sounds like Luke has more problems than ADHD.  he needs to get some help.<br>  <br>  maybe bring him to the doctor and tell them what is going on with him.<br>  <br>  as for Claudia, yes, take her to the ER.  and don't EVER leave them alone together.<br>  <br>  just don't ever leave Luke alone with any of your siblings.  he's already shown he's harmful to others, and when you're not around, they aren't safe.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	yes you were right to do that but you need to take ur sister to the er to make sure he didn't re break her wrist.<br>  and take him to the psychiatrist he might be bipolar to|`|foJm2Yftaa	I say you should get her in the emergency room and it was right to spank him, after all he is supposed to respect her not hit her!|`|rBq189W1aa	Gee, I wonder where he's getting the idea that it's acceptable to hit people?<br>  <br>  STOP SPANKING YOUR SIBLINGS. There are other ways of dealing with unacceptable behaviour. Look into them.|`|s2X1Wcliaa	It looks like you need to get your brother checked out. He may have bipolar disorder, too.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	take your brother to get looked at maybe he can get some meds <br>  ER YES!|`|2V87n4PKaa	you should take your sister to the doc, just to make sure shes ok<br>  as for your brother, you did right by spanking him.<br>  if you can afford it, you should take him to a doctor, or pchysiatrist or something! he cant go on hurting your sister like that!<br>  <br>  also, i think your sister is old enough to defend herself and to discipline her brother. tell her if he starts to beat her up again, put him in a closet or small room and leave him in their until he either apologizes or until hes in there for an hour|`|peQGGFPYaa	I feel sorry for you man i have read your other questions. I dont think spanking is working at all in your case in fact in sounds like it is working the exact opposite of what it should. You guys need to go to a family counselor. I don't think she needs to go to the emergency room, unless the tylenol doesn't work. If worst comes to worst you might need to get social services involved. i know that sounds horrible but this is alot of responsibility that just got thrown on top of you. no matter how mature you are this situation has to be difficult. Luke seems to be a threat to the well being of others in the household maybe he needs anger management of possibly consider military school.<br>  Best of luck to you, you will be in my prayers.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	You are the parent you did the right thing in correcting and spanking.  But yes bring Claudia to the ER, stop listening to the advice of others and head out...  You should take her to ER.  <br>  <br>  By the way you were right in spanking him.  I know he has always been your brother but now you are a parent and a guardian, I know it will be hard but with time the mindset will change.|`|txv7TIgiaa	wow that sounds like a lot of pressure!!! i think you may need to seekprofessionall help for your brother because you want to nip this hitting women thing in the butt asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i think you are doing the best you can...|`|za3Cqcvsaa	Bring her to the ER and you're not a parent. You're just a guardian.|`|nrQy2uauaa	Are you the sole guardian? Is there another family member who can help you or take your siblings? You didn't do anything wrong and it sounds like you're trying your best, but you're too young to raise three kids who have emotional problems and are grieving. Maybe you all should look into individual and family counseling. Your sister needs to be taken to the doctor and your brother needs immediate anger management counseling. If he continues to hurt her, CPS will intervene. If you don't take your sister to the doctor, CPS can charge you for neglect.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	You need help with your family. You need to take your sister to the ER immediately- there could be some injures that you cannot see.  Your brother needs professional help here- he may be bipolar as well, or he may be acting out in his behavior.  He is 9 and lost both parents, this is hard on any child- get him some help- and you need help with the children. You are the care giver for your sister and brothers, and I do not think spanking was inappropriate.
a1uoxczTaa	what does driving have to do with bringing you teenager to a wedding?|`|fSKQrR7Uaa	Probably not a few. Maybe one celebratory glass if you are there just to make sure she is controlled and does not go overboard. And it might be dangerous if she is really drunk or even just a little woozy to put her behind the wheel. Tell her you will happily buy her a cab ride home if she has had something to drink.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	One drink could be enough to kill innocent people. If you are wise, you would not allow your 15-year-old daughter to drink and drive.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Wait you want her to drive after she's been drinking?  If so, that's a ridiculous idea.  Don't do it.|`|xvey8ixPaa	You sound like a teenager PRETENDING to be an adult. Bet I am right.|`|6OplSEQkaa	you're an idiot|`|sCKJzcNpaa	do it for the lols|`|XrKviWgSaa	you are stupid if your letting your 15 yr old drive after a couple glasses of wine|`|91217feb6370ce6af68bc6c0985c99e5aa	What the balls and that has what to do w/ a wedding?|`|KPAOU0kaaa	Yeah... no. Someone could get seriously injured, or even killed. Then how would you feel?|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Are you nuts? I personally think that you are posing a great liability on yourself, your daughter's future, and other people.  Just teach her that no matter what you don't drive in that condition.  Be responsible.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	If this is a joke, it's not funny.<br>  <br>  If it isn't a joke, you are beyond pathetic.|`|HZ0dltJtaa	I sincerely hope that you posted this question just to get a reaction out of people, and that you aren't serious. What kind of example do you think you'd be setting to let her drive AFTER allowing her a couple glasses of wine? Wow, I'm disgusted.|`|pj5bUjbQaa	considering the questions you have asked in the past...  you must be bored so you ask ridiculous questions in order to entertain yourself when people actually think your serious.|`|LUg9dgb5aa	Uh, thats NOT a good idea.|`|ZQsO1T4oaa	that's how Innocent people get killed.
OH8c4LDfaa	First, I would see if you could get extra credit or help from the teacher, GOOD LUCK!|`|p0prrzf2aa	no, you shouldn't. if your remembering words that good, why are you making D's? where I'm from you have to take 4 classes like french or spanish in order to graduate, idk if it's the same for you but i'd go ahead and get it done|`|6OplSEQkaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
4E2BoVptaa	They will re-do that test somewhere between 28-30 weeks when your cortosol levels are at their highest. That's when they tested me again, and that's the explanation that my OB gave me. So, I wouldn't worry until then.|`|AA10976444	I had my 1 hour test at 24 weeks...was high, and went for the 3 hour test...eneded up with insulin dependant gestational diabetes.  The earlier the better.|`|fHgbL046aa	I only got one with my first pregnancy and I'm 22 weeks pregnant now and will get one at 28 weeks of pregnancy.|`|8wVj8odOaa	I've never heard of anyone ever have the GTT so early! Just seems a little too early to be having the test done IMO<br>  <br>  I've always been tested around 30 weeks. At about 30 weeks your levels should be between 60 and 140 anything else is questionable and you'll be subjected to the 3 hour test.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	i have the glucose test next week and ill be 25 weeks. the way they do it here is they take three blood tests with you drinking lucazade in between. one blood test every hour. long process :) if you feel like you need to take another one talk to your doctor about it|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I am surprised you had one done that early to be honest.  I believe the number has to be under 140.  I would think he would make you do another one around week 28
aEgYElA8aa	There is such a thing as subchorionic bleeding, something to do with the placenta not attaching in places.Ive read it on quite a few websites. Look it up on google.It doesnt cause any harm to the baby, providing the bleeding stops. Thats the only thing i can think of.xx|`|1vnwW3n5aa	if there are clots than that a miscarriage   but if not that could be implant of the egg  so i would go get checked just in case|`|w42vjbYYaa	so they said it wasnt a miscarrige?.. it does sound like it to me, i experienced it and the symptoms sound very similar.  you should maybe to see what another doctor's point of view is, i would go see two doctors.|`|AA10976444	I had the same problems with both my pregnancies.  I didn't have any of the cramps...but with my second, I had a clot the size of a quarter.  Both pregnancies had unexplained bleeding, and I carried both to term.  I was told that in late pregnancy, sometimes blood clots attach themselves to the placenta, and sometimes it happens early as well.  After I passed the clot, I never had anymore bleeding....good luck to you...I know the stress because I ahve been there twice.|`|50lIaC8zaa	I did have bleeding when i was about 6 weeks pregnant with my second not any pain though. I also had tiny clots in it (they said its ok, they only worry when the clots are the size of the palm of your hand), i went for a scan and they saw a heart beat and said everything was fine. <br>  The bleeding stopped after about a week and my LO is now 9 months old :)
azE51WGRaa	If you can, try drinking more milk. Usually people who bruise easily do so because they're not getting enough calcium in their diets. When you're pregnant, then your body gets even less because a lot of it goes to the baby. Down the moo juice and see if it helps. Congrats =D|`|qimX2B1Aaa	use cocoa butter|`|4E2BoVptaa	There are several possibilities. The most common are anemia or lack of calcium. Both can be checked by your doctor!
u6jP7BQNaa	Two is normal, although some do it longer.|`|942f313b2c81b37310c7808f5ed1d1a9aa	When they stop putting "everything" in their mouth, will probably be when they stop teething .And I believe kids put things in their mouths out of habit after the teething period .. My niece stop chewing on things just recently and she is almost 5.. and I still chew on my pencil and iam 24yrs old :D|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Honestly? I agree with Rhianna G. So babies are just mouth babies and grow up to be mouth kids, teens, and adults. <br>  <br>  Every kid is different.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	never, it never happens lol. Have you seen a 17 year olds pen?|`|sw2R5A9iaa	i'm still oral -look around all smoking adults are.  this never changes, so stress less.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	My son is two and I still catch him putting things in his mouth all the time. :)
8wVj8odOaa	that happened to me with my last pregnancy. It took about a week before I started 'leaking' out of the other nipple. I say give it a couple of days to a week and if there is still nothing, speak to your doctor. You've still got 10 weeks, so there's time.<br>  Now here I sit, 38 weeks and 4 days and I'm plum dry still!<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	It is fine and it is normal. <br>  Mine did not leak at all in my first pregnancy and I was so afraid I would not be able to breastfeed my son. <br>  It worked out just fine and I did so beautifully.<br>  If it bothers you too much, talk to the doctor and allow him to reassure you.
l4mMBe5Aaa	Most drying racks and dishwasher baskets are pretty standard - they all have places to put all kinds of little pieces...  We used Playtex Ventaire bottles, and we put the tops, bottoms, and vents in the bottom of the dishwasher basket, and the nipples in the top (we have 2 of the baskets in the link below - they were baby shower gifts!).  Our daughter is now 12 months old, and we no longer use bottles, but the basket still works great for sippy cups and all of their components.  I even use it for small things (like cookie cutters!) that I want to run through the dishwasher.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Assuming they are dishwasher safe, just put them on the top rack anywhere they fit well. In my dishwasher they fit well in the mug rack.<br>  <br>  I never heard of a special drying rack. What's wrong with the same one you dry everything else on? Either your daughter is old enough for non-sterilised bottles which are washed with everything else or she isn't.
1ddcbe75f31dd36391d2ce294a3e3c02aa	yes i think you will be dialating soon, dont be suprised if you end up in the hospital in a week or two. Look for your mucus plug... when u lose that then you will know labor is near
CdJtH0xdaa	I haven't seen them anywhere in supermarkets. I think they're only available in ice cream trucks.

mb8VVoLBaa	either in school suspension<br>  regular suspension<br>  a week of detention, or expelled|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Suspension or expulsion.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	You can claim harassment, "you felt threatened", and self defense.

NTfIJa7zaa	My doctor told me that eating fish was fine during pregnancy (2-3 servings a week). He said the fish you need to stay away from are the fishes that you generally wouldnt consider eating anyway. He even mentioned tuna fish and that it is very good for me. I also read an article a couple of months ago about a study that was performed on women who ate fish during pregnancy. They found that the children of the mothers that ate fish had higher intelligence levels.|`|FxAD44Moaa	oh and salmon doesn't have that?  since when?|`|AA10976444	You can still have tuna...the canned kind.  You can limit it to 3 x per week.

IRlVBGWOaa	Ha Ha!  This happens because parents don't give a rat's ***.  I have a 4 year old and wouldn't even think of taking him to a museum or equivalent.  Some people are just rude and inconsiderate....plain and simple.<br>  <br>  *****And I agree with Trish....it doesn't matter if you are a parent or not.  It doesn't take a parent to know that you should not take children to museums if they aren't going to behave.  Its called "being polite"; some parents haven't heard of it.|`|xi7mq1xGaa	I know exactly what you mean. This annoys me greatly, because as a teacher of a Nursery class who have in the past sat and watched a play quietly that went on for an hour and a half, I know children are capable of watching things properly, sitting still, paying attention etc so why don't parents realise this?! Some people have said don't take your child to a museum at all. I disagree - take them and show them appropriate behaviour. Children generally just want attention. If they have your undivided attention talking to them about exhibits etc then they (usually!) won't misbehave. The trouble comes because when people have their kids out in public they suddenly seem to think that other people will watch their children and they don't have to bother with them for a while! This also occurs in places such as restaurants. I cringe when I see 4 year olds running round a restaurant, getting in the way of the waiting staff and generally causing chaos. I know every one of the 26 children in my class would be able to sit still during a meal - fair enough not a long drawn out one, but up to an hour. Maybe not with their parents - I don't know if all of them would expect such behaviour, but definitely if they came out with me for a meal! It is the adult's job to be sitting with them talking to them, explaining good behaviour, praising them, and just giving them some attention. My grandma once told my mother she'd privately used to think my mum was much too strict with my brother and me, but having gone out for the day with us when we were very young she said she'd realised that we could be taken anywhere and we would behave ourselves. I plan on raising my kids in much the same way.|`|pe1k46Uhaa	clearly you aren't a parent, stop moaning,weren't't you a child once, did you never misbehave, or do something you weren't supposed to...or were you that child berated and scolded by your parents the moment you opened you're mouth. museums have always had a stuffy reputation and its only in recent years they've come to realise that the only way that they will survive for the next generation is to open themselves up to change..hence my museum in Cardiff has activity mornings every weekend with emphasis on FUN....something which You are clearly lacking.<br>  <br>  Oh and P.S, Trish if you think im a twit..(mmm..strong language!!) bear in mind that I am not only a father to 3 gorgeous kid aged 4, 6,and 8, and know exactly what im talking about, you clearly come from the land that time forgot...where children should be see and not heard...wake up love and smell the new millenium!!!|`|i4I0cuudaa	Why do parents let their children behave badly anywhere? Some twit said you are obviously not a parent - what rubbish.  I am a parent and grandparent and have never let children run wild anywhere they shouldn't.|`|aLNLl482aa	Good luck with this one fella!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  LOLOLOLOL<br>  <br>  *legs it*|`|yzakyjNKaa	the only museum that i would take my kids to is the childrens museum they are supposed to run around there and play and scream its all new to them but not us but yet still fun|`|VHHis05Naa	My daughter is at the art museum right now with her Daddy.  She is very well-behaved and enjoys it.  We take her on the free day once per month and there are plenty of children there.  My daughter never runs around wild anywhere.  She is on the shy side and sticks close to Daddy.  I don't see how bringing a child to a museum is such a bad idea.  It totally depends on the kid.|`|8dhe15MUaa	it not just museums|`|AA12362903	As the mom of three little boys that can get out of hand if not watched closely, I completely agree.  I make sure not to take them by myself and usually bring either my husband, teenage niece or sister.  We always make sure to stay right with the kids.  What we do is to take them to a children's or science museum where they'll find things that interest them as well.  They know the rules (3 strikes and you're out.  If you act up you go in time out for a bit, once more and the time out is longer, third time and we leave).  We have a museum membership that gets us into most museums in the country for free so it's no big deal for us to take them home.  They've learned so much at the museums and have such a great time so we keep going.|`|muX5G72Vaa	Oh God I couldn't agree more. Last time I went to the Science Museum in Kensington with a friend, there was an annoying little brat running around screaming, while the mother just sat on a bench chatting to a friend. My friend and I were at the museum for study purposes, so that really ruined our trip.<br>  <br>  Why don't they just take their kids to the park?|`|32866571f9996aa9d609f6f782586569aa	Totally agree, wouldnt dream of taking my pair into a museum until they're old enough to understand and appreciate it.  Spoils it for everyone else.|`|2pxiK9waaa	That's what strollers are for...people should really figure that out... and if your kids are too big for strollers and they're still acting like that, then there's a good chance there's little to no discipline at home.

Which I think is garbage.  It's not human nature to be a jerk!  It's an a$$es nature to be a jerk.<br>  I don't get why some people attack others for no reason.  Really, does this make people feel better.  I mean, yes by all means stand up for yourself, and voice your opinions, but don't put some one down because they choose to parent different then you.  I have been attacked, and that's exactly what it is attacking some one, and I have pretty much never been rude to any one on here.<br>  If I don't agree with some one doing something or their style of parenting, I don't even bother to open the question, never mind waste my time answering.  I think there is some people on here that really need to grow up, and stop playing the internet bully!|`|eu6UQElYaa	I've seen it the exact opposite to be honest.<br>  Breastfeeders seem to criticize formula feeders more but formula feeders tend to throw more downright hateful comments at breastfeeders.<br>  Spanker's tend to thumbs down and criticize non-spankers<br>  Anti-Circumcisers do seem to thumbs down and criticize more than the circumcisers<br>  I agree with your vaccine view.<br>  I've seen more anti-cosleepers criticizing than co-sleepers.<br>  <br>  That's just what I've noticed anyways.

I get a lot of thumbs down when I try to answer questions nicely about breast feeding and co-sleeping, because people think just because I support these things that I'm anti formula feeding or anti co-sleeping.  it's really a two way street for every issue.

That's why that particular subject starts a lot of stuff between people.<br>  <br>  Since circumcision is never a neccisary procedure unless there is a severe medical need then it's not a parent's right to make that choice.<br>  Sorry to say but it's not.<br>  <br>  It's the boys body, not the parents and therefore unless there is a sever need then it's not the parents decision for making.<br>  The parents don't have to live with the conciquences of the choice for the rest of their lives so why should they get to make it?<br>  Circumcision is more of a human rights issue more than anything else, not a "parent's" issue.<br>  <br>  I haven't heard much of a debate on the other topics much other than breast feeing. I don't care what people chose, however formula doesn't do much to your child other than feed them. Breast milk does so much for the babies but it really depends on the parent because I'm all for breast feeing, but as a baby I refused to drink it so I had to be on formula. I think the baby decides more of that than the parents. My mom didn't get to chose I chose for her lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually the spanking part I don't agree with because. I am all for spanking kids and I don't like it when people don't. (I mean if they have a good kid then theirs really no need but what I hate are bad kids that only get timeouts it's like the parents don't get that the time outs aren't working.) but it really depends.<br>  <br>  Parents have the right to make choices for their child that are definatly needed and don't efffect them for the rest of their lives in a big way.<br>  Like altering your childs body isn't apart of those decisions in my mind. But if you are for it, do it but don't be suprized if it effects your relationship with your son who resents you for it.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	I have noticed it but I have to say that the formula feeders DO criticise the breast feeders and the spankers DO criticise the non spankers. <br>  I have seen it.

These people are what the yahoo community call ''trolls''|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I'm personally sick of being called a  breastfeeding "nazi".<br>  I feel way more judged for offering breastfeeding support then I think formula feeders get judged. (Well except for Amanduh and all her accounts, but she doesn't count, she's just an idiot.)<br>  I get criticized all the time for being a non-spanker. I've been told many times my kids are going to grow up to be brats....<br>  And I get flak all the time for for co-sleeping.

It would behoove everyone not to judge.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could argue that people come to this forum with the expectation that they will find highly differing viewpoints.  So, if someone wants to be very opinionated about something - great - so long as they back it up with legitimate references.  But of course...very few people actually put legitimate references and so the back and forth begins rather easily.  There's a reason why Y!A puts that source box down there...<br>  <br>  But yes, I notice the trends you have as well, except with the circumcision thing but that may be just because I never look at those questions because I don't care (and I didn't circumcise, so I'm counter-your-theory).|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I haven't noticed so much criticism, more just people explaining their opinions and explaining why they think that way. Some people incorrectly take this as criticism, maybe because they know deep down they're not doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  I've noticed far more formula feeders criticise breast feeders for criticising them than I have seen any breast feeders criticise anybody (and the only ones I did see, like Amanda, were extreme and probably trolls.) There's no expression as a "formula feeding nazi" yet people think it's okay to say that for people who promote breast feeding, and have you seen how many yuck comments somebody gets for breast feeding past 2? <br>  <br>  However when it comes to spanking and circumcision, when people think another child is being harmed, yes they might criticise. I get that. Personally I'm sick of people posting questions about how their son's circumcision got screwed up. I agree with Connor, it's not a simple "parenting choice". Anti-circumcision people simply provide facts about why it's not a good idea and rebut reasons for it. By contrast pro-circumcision people say stupid things like "you don't want him to have an ugly penis do you" <br>  <br>  I haven't seen much vaccine criticism, but I have seen criticisms of co-sleepers (somebody even posted the other day that co-sleepers had no sex life at all! If she thinks sex is only in bed at night I would say she doesn't have a very good sex life lol)<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Parents and people in general are passionate about their beliefs. But you can be passionate and still rationally explain the reasons why you choose to formula feed, breast feed, co-sleep  or whatever the case may be without verbally attacking those parents who's parenting style differs to your own. It is possible to give advice and state why you disagree with, for example, spanking, without resorting to insults.<br>  It's possible to debate without the name calling and insults but, it seems, that some parents on YA, don't have the capacity to debate their case or cause without feeling the need to degrade and belittle the person they are disagreeing with.<br>  I do disagree with your "general trend" theory though. On YA, it seems the minority don't spank so I have been attacked for not believing in the use of hitting as discipline. Many parents believe that a parent who does not spank does not discipline and some believe those parents to be lazy and lax in their parenting abilities. I have been attacked for breastfeeding my son who is 23 months because many parents on YA are against "extended" breastfeeding. I've seen an equal amount of abuse between and against those who vaccinate their children and those who choose not to. I think, what it boils down to, is having the maturity and knowledge to inform and state your side of the arguement without resorting to childish slurs and needless rudeness. Those who can rationally debate and defend their parenting style usually have valid points which are worth reading and I take an interest in such answers despite my own, sometime conflicting, viewpoitns.|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	Ask a formula feeder about breastfeeding past a year and the critisism is just nasty.  Heck, ask a breastfeeder who weaned at or before a year.  You can't lump groups together.  What you are seeing is just the most vocal of the groups.  It's not reflective of real life and real attitudes.  I think in real life, most people just don't care.<br>  <br>  Critisism comes from all sides and whether one side is critical or the other side is defensive depends on which side you happen to be on.|`|VCCKfT3taa	I've noticed it too, it can get pretty brutal. I even read an answer that implied that one mom was "letting her child die of loneliness" by letting her fuss in her crib for a few minutes. <br>  <br>  Pro BF/ Pro Formula<br>  Pro Spanking<br>  Anti Circumcize<br>  Pro Vaccine<br>  Don't really care about the co-sleeping issue. ^_^|`|942f313b2c81b37310c7808f5ed1d1a9aa	Yes, I have noticed those trends also....I had  people, who dont have any kids criticize me about how to raise my son on yahoo answers and in general .. * breast feedng and co sleeping wil spoil your child* circumcision is evil .....I also believe some people on here, say things to keep things interesting and arguementive?? I dont judge other moms on how they want to raise their children. They were the ones who went through the labor and pain, not me.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	yep ive noticed that too. I try not to judge because im not living there lives and i dont know why they made that decision. Im also a formula feeder, last resort spanker, agree with circumcising, pro vaccine and a co-sleep so i guess i lie in the more non judgmental categories lol.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	I've noticed it too, especially the breast feeders criticizing formula feeders.  I wish we could get along.  We're women, and we should be helping each other, instead of putting each down.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Yes, but that's life. Peoples differing opinions conflict in a lot of places, not just on yahoo.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Yep I completely agree with what you said.|`|3oSQQt6maa	Yes i have noticed that too. It's crazy.|`|AA12373801	yea i see it|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Here is what my opinion is about anyone on YA<br>  <br>  It is all in how you talk to people. Opinions are welcomed and accepted, but you have to know how to be cooth about it.<br>  <br>  There is a difference between opinions and rants. Play nice with others and they will play nice with you. Be a jerk and you will just look ignorant.<br>  <br>  There is a certain way you can say something to someone, even if it is a differing opinion, and it come across as adult behavior. <br>  <br>  The main problem is that there are too many kids that get on here, or even adults who have never learned how to treat others nicely. <br>  <br>  Usually those people are angry at the world and misery love's company. <br>  <br>  Now, I am sure I will get a million thumbs down for this. But as you are thumbs downing me, ask yourself why; because you think it is funny? (Immature behavior) Because I upset you for some reason? (perhaps the truth can annoy people) <br>  <br>  Regardless, I hope you all have a wonderful day and smile more. :)|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Oh yes, I have noticed!<br>  <br>  On feeding I have seen one woman, who will remain un named for the sake of not causing an argument, purposefully stir trouble regarding none breast feeding mothers.<br>  <br>  I am a none spanker, but I wouldn't criticise a spanker.<br>  <br>  I am pro vaccine, but received a torrent of abuse when The NHS lost my daughters vaccine records which resulted in her having measles (it is against the law for them to vaccine without the records being passed from a health care provider, it is also against the law for them to get lost) and was told I was a poor mother for an NHS mess up!<br>  <br>  In the UK circumcision isn't a huge issue unless you are religiously inclined to do so, so I remain indifferent on the matter.<br>  <br>  Co-sleeping, indifferent again. I am too paranoid to try it!<br>  <br>  <br>  I have seen this trend and it is pathetic. People come here for help not to be judged!<br>  <br>  \ETA: I think The Christian Mother and Emilees Mommy have summed it up perfectly, especially regarding how we are women and should help each other.<br>  <br>  BTW I am open to opinions other than my own, I just don't see harsh words as necessary.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	I didn't breast feed, I didn't co-sleep, I used disposable diapers, I vaccinated my child, and yes I do spank my child, these were my parenting choices. I truly believe that there are some posters on here who think they "know-it-all", when in fact NO one knows it all. It's a matter of respect, and giving respectful answers. I don't criticize others for their parenting choices, yet I am criticized. I know I'm a good mom to my special needs child. I have followed this motto since the day my son was born.. Happy Mother=Happy Baby. <br>  <br>  That's my two cents.<br>  <br>  Edit: And Yes I did circumcise my son.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I've noticed it and it really bugs me. Of course you're not going to agree with everything people say, but to start debates and critise others for not making the same decisions as you is pathetic. Everyone raises their children as they see fit, and why people can't accept that I do not know.
a8IRxC4raa	We call things by their proper names.  There's nothing shameful or embarrassing about any part of the body unless we make it so.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|2pxiK9waaa	I'd use either vagina--you can break down the parts later, or private parts. Don't say pee-pee. Not so cute when she's eight and still calling it that. It's better to be honest and politically correct to an extent. You can break it down later, but when you go for your 3 year checkup with her, the doctor is going to ask whether she knows the name of her body parts and if they are the correct terms. They did with my nephew and he knew his penis was there and the doctor said it was really important that he knew the right terminology--especially if anything "sketchy" ever happened to him.|`|8RfmosODaa	My sister calls it a bug, lol. But I think you could say vagina. My son is 3 and he knows its a penis. You could also go with pee-pee or private area?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Her privates and that's as much as I'm getting into it. She can go ask her mother.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	I will say "vagina".  I'm not going to try to teach her all the different parts (vulva, etc).  It's not necessary.  When I'm referring to my crotch area, I call it a vagina.  <br>  <br>  If you want to confuse your poor daughter will all of those "big people" words, go for it.  But when she's older, she'll call it a "vagina" like everyone else does!!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	You should be complertely comfortable telling her the correct wording for all bod y parts...it is a persons own discomfort that makes these words wrong for a child to know.  There is no point in teaching her it is called a pee pee...that sounds worse if you ask me.  She'll just have to learn the right word later and really...how is it any different than telling her a leg is called a leg or a nose is a nose...you don't make of names like sniffer for nose so why make up names for other parts.  Don't make a big deal of thigs and they won't be a big deal.|`|eZAz6orMaa	haha aww! why cant you say vagina? or  this is what makes us girls and different from boys.<br>  the word vulva is slightly scary and pee-pee is a little immature and weird.|`|CyeYMaUuaa	Girl parts.<br>  <br>  When I was little, I called girl's part's the doodoo, and boy's parts the dingle. Lol.|`|peQGGFPYaa	i call it her privates or her lady parts.|`|AA11537580	always called my daughters vulva a vulva<br>  it makes it easier to teach them about sex and bad touch later|`|2V87n4PKaa	my mom called it my "ching-ching"<br>  ugh...<br>  <br>  i would just use tell her the real name|`|rBq189W1aa	My daughter calls hers her vagina. While it may not be completely accurate, it's close enough, and at least it's better than "hoo-hoo" or some other embarrassing baby talk names parents invent for that part of the body because they can't deal with calling it by its actual name for some reason.<br>  <br>  You're right though, 'vulva' is a weird word.<br>  <br>  Vulva.<br>  <br>  Vul-va! Sounds like a Lee/Kirby comicbook monster from the 50s!|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	Tell er it is her vagina I mean really do you call your head a cat<br>  or your ears telephones? I am 11 and I wish my mom would have told me the proper names because when I read a magazine I learn briefly then went on the computer and found out what it was and about what is the proper name for my private parts,and everything else when I was 9 and also found about STDS.<br>  The website is <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/</a>|`|1cd1a1b76e941fcfe0cfccd731dc0f09aa	ill tell her they are her private parts or her vagina, no need for other names, they might just  confuse her later when we do the sex talk.|`|uBvd2BZxaa	no bootay<br>  no coochay<br>  no ifs ands or buts|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Tell her what it really is. You call other things by their correct name like knees and feet and eyes and this should be no exception. I hate to hear adults still say things like pee-pee and pickle. Can we all just say what they are, it sounds so silly to use a made up name and if she learns that first she will never be comfortable using the real words.|`|VHHis05Naa	I've told her what the parts are when she asks, but she prefers to say vagina.  I also tell her when she asks that it is her special parts that no one should touch except Mommy to wipe her and bath her and the doctor to check her when Mommy or Daddy are there.  I think calling it pee pee and then calling what comes out pee is confusing and will not help protect the child.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	It depends on how far along you were, and how much HCG you had in your system. The farther along you were, the longer it will take for the HCG to leave your system entirely. Some women are slow to have declining HCG, and can take up to a month before they dont have any. <br>  The key is whenever you start your next period after the miscarriage, the HCG is gone from your body. Your body wont be able to menstruate with having a high level of HCG in your body. Once the HCG is gone, youll have a period, and that signifies that you have no more. <br>  Good luck with ttc.|`|azE51WGRaa	Sometimes it can take up to 6 weeks for your body to stop making the hemoglobin hormone (which is responsible for giving you a positive on a test). I'd wait another week or two to take another test. Every woman's body is different, so you might be able to get an accurate result then. Good luck and I'm so sorry for your loss..|`|0zZZHXvVaa	it can take up to six weeks sometimes even more|`|y360AXDmaa	I'd say about 2 or 3 weeks.<br>  If you can, wait. If not go to the doctor and get a blood test.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	When you have a full term birth it takes about 6 weeks for the pregnancy hormones to disappear completely, and less time than that the earlier you deliver or miscarry.  It depends on how far along you were in the pregnancy.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	It can take up to 4-6 weeks for your body to "restart". You should listen to your doc and wait at least a month or two before TTC again. Good luck.
VKQzj4Pmaa	If he went right to sleep, then I guess he didn't have an upset stomach; otherwise I think he would have been fussy about it, and would have been difficult to put back to sleep. <br>  <br>  Was he trying to do a bowel movement? Maybe he was trying to push? Is he constipated? Does he have gas? If it was a one time thing, I wouldn't worry too much about it. If it happens often, then your best bet is to make a doctor's appointment.|`|AA11100890	Babies breathe with their bellies.

I was with her father for two and half years, when he left me when I was 33 weeks pregnant for someone else. He doesn't pay child support to her (YET, he will get a kick up the ar$e soon), he smokes and drinks like there's no tomorrow, he doesn't bother coming to see her.... (FYI he's changed in the past few months, he was never like this before). As a result of what he's done to me, I have PPD and have no confidence. He's a waste of space.|`|AjxP6Wrzaa	Got pregnant when I was 16, had my daughter when I was 17 & am now 18. I found out I was pregnant on my 17th birthday. Happy birthday to me! =] Lol. My daughter is now 5 months & 1 week old. Taking care of her is hard at times. But I wouldn't take back getting pregnant for the world. My daughters father is not a bad person. But he would rather be somewhere else doing something, then taking care of his daughter. He hasn't fed or changed a diaper since she was about a month old. Which is sad, I know. But all in all, I love being a single parent to my daughter. =] Just recently my daughters two bottom teeth came in! I was sooo excited when they did!!|`|FU2dpr8Uaa	I'm a single mother of a 15 day old boy. My baby's daddy comes and goes whenever he feels like it and whenever he feels like being a parent to my son he'll stop by to see him. I was really annoyed and pissed off at him to begin with because throughout my whole pregnancy he did the same thing; just come by one or twice a week to sleep at my place for a couple hours and considered that spending time with me and really wanted me to have the baby because it was a boy. He never gave me any physical or emotional support. I pretty much cried my eyes out throughout most of my pregnancy. I felt very guilty as though I didn't want to keep my own baby but I was just stressed out and worried about what would happened to my son when he was born. I wasn't financially stable, I was in my early twenties, and within my nationality beliefs I should be married before having any children, but I wasn't. IT was rough. I went to an adoption agency and tried to see if I could get an adoption done but since my baby's daddy didn't agree with it I couldn't do the adoption on my own. I think this was just his way of trying to "control" me. <br>  <br>  When I had my son at the hospital my baby's daddy did come with me and held my hand throughout my labor but as soon as he was born, the same thing again. He would just come and go whenever he felt like it. I lefted the hospital the following day and since then my baby's daddy has never spent one night with my son. I take care of my son 24/7 and get up with him everynight. My baby's daddy comes by every other day or every few days to see him for a few hours a day. Its sucks that I'm tired all the time and feel as though I don't ever have any time to do anything, its frustrating, especially when I'm a new parent, breastfeeding and had a fever for the past few days. But now since I've been getting use to it, its not too bad. I love my son very much and I wouldn't trade him for anything. I just know that if I don't take good care of him no one will, especially his dad, since he's only around went he wants to be. <br>  <br>  My baby's daddy isn't a bad person, just not a good parent. I feel bad I have to file for child support even though he asked me not to, because I know he'll help me out financially but I can't let him try to "control" me and my personal life by trying to blackmail me because we have a son together. I never planned on being a single mother and I've always dreamt of having that perfect family where my children would have both a mother and father figure in there life but I guess life has its ways. I know my son didn't chose to be in this situation so I love him even more, because only a mother knows how to love their child the best!|`|7HzfgRmwaa	I have a precious 12 day old little boy. The daddy and I were together for a year. Planned a child and a future. I got pregnant. He cheated on me. Then left me when I was 9 weeks pregnant. Hasn't been in the picture since. I did the whole pregnancy without him and labor and plan to do the next little while without him too. When my son is a few years older we will go find that SOB so he can pay child support and so my son can know his father.|`|ArYvBhkpaa	Well my daughter is only 11 days old,but still.I'm 15,and her dad made 18 in January.We were at a party,so you can figure that out.I haven't heard/talked to him since I was about 16 weeks.

If not,  and he's reasonable, you have a chance to work this out to a good mutual agreement.<br>  <br>  Parenthood is very over-whelming as I'm sure you know.   He prolly has pain from the divorce too.  When I divorced, my kids didn't talk to me for years - and I was a very good dad.   I'm still estranged from my daughter but she's doing well - she just couldn't accept heer.<br>  <br>  My son and I are fine - and he is fine with my new wife.<br>  <br>  Enough about me - the point I'm trying to make is that men, more than women can go into parenthood with the absolute best of intentions and screw it up royal.   Beware all you couples out there;  having children sometimes magnified the problems in relationships.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway,  with your brother - if he's reasonable, and he won't act like ajerk to you, try explaining to him that this just isn't going to work.  Tell him how you fell - either like a doormat. or taken advantage of, however it is you feel.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't, or isn't able to hear you, think about moving out - you are not a babysitter service.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well if you can afford to move out i would do it just because he sounds like a real jerk to live with. if that isn't an option just tell him straight up that you are sick of his crap and refuse to watch HIS kid for him whether it's one day a week or every day of the week. and if he did go for custody i would be there at the hearing to tell the judge what an idiot he is when he has her especially if the mother is doing a good job caring for the girl.|`|AA11887900	On Saturdays go out with your son, go to the library or the mall or something BEFORE he gets back so that he has to deal with his child. If he has to watch his own child because you find something else to do on Saturdays, he may think twice about seeking full custody. Or he may actually start to become a decent father.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Why would you want to call social services on your own brother?  Damn, I'm glad I'm not related to you!  Why not just confront him and tell him to get his act together?  <br>  <br>  And if you don't want to be a live-in babysitter, move out.|`|613731c6b9480676d95389bc1f932d98aa	are you his sister or mother? You sound like his wife.  If you dont like it move on. I dont see any reason to call social services.  Personally it sounds like you have major issues.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	dont do his job for him...walk away and the call social services anonimously if you want and address your concerns...he doesnt deserve this child at all!|`|htD82ij1aa	Well if there is a custody battle in the works you might want to speak on behalf of her mother, it sounds like you know your brother shouldn't have custody of the kid and as his sister you make for a powerful witness, usually in custody battles they will ask family members what they think, so just be honest when they ask you.
DkT8znckaa	I have this problem too. Sometimes early in the morning, I'll act like I'm sleeping in my bed, and I can hear her come in my room and go through my drawers. She opens all my drawers and cabinets, and just takes stuff from my room all the time. My mom especially has a thing for taking my hair brushes, my flat iron and my slippers. I will look for the stuff like crazy, then I'll be like "Wait a minute.... I know who has it!"  It is her house, so I guess as long as I'm living here, she can do whatever she wants..... plus, she bought all my stuff with her money (Well, almost all of it) and so I guess that gives her a right to do whatever she wants with it. I'm glad to hear my mom isn't the only one who does that. It is SO annoying. My dad is the only person in my house who knocks. My mom and m brother just come in, and they won't leave even if I ask them. They come in and stay as long as they feel like it.|`|iTOCf9Mzaa	I am 16 and my mum just walks in, it is her house so she can do whatever she likes but i dont see why it really matters, its not like u have anything she has never seen before, if you are a pre-teen also then you are still a child so you cant have anything to hide, you probally aint even gone through puberty so theres nothing to really worry about.|`|wyAbkG3oaa	I am 25, and I had this problem with my mum. She would move all my stuff around, and I could not have anything private. It used to bug me so much so I talked to her about it, and luckly she understood and did not realise she was being a pain. Try talking to her.|`|CJZyZ1Braa	OMG same her and Im 13|`|uB4ZQOEDaa	she does own it !!! and she is an adult and your mum so she should have privacy and respect from you.  However this obviously bothers you so why don't you speak to your mum and come to a compromise such as she respect your privacy when you have friends in or when you are getting changed.|`|o5HyQ1ebaa	just tell her that you need privacy just like her and tell to at least knock on the door and respect your things. if she wont listen then keep asking her and tell your dad to convince her to give you some privacy unless your mom is single.<br>  tell her that u are groing up and need the privacy|`|FNb7a2kMaa	I used to....them i grew up<br>  <br>  too be honest if its your mums house she kinda can do what she wants, when she wants.<br>  <br>  maybe try and talk to her though and just say you would like a wee bit more privacy and hopefull she will respect your wishes,<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ACXO5Jloaa	Get over it...if you live under her roof then you should deal with it<br>  <br>  she is paying the mortgage..she can do what she likes :)|`|DsszxGT6aa	OMG!

PDHCOrOSaa	Yes this sounds like PPD.  It's nothing to be ashamed about and a quick trip to the doctor and some medicine can completely change your outlook on everything.  I don't have PPD, but 1 close friend plus a cousin of mine did and they are so much happier since they received help from there doctor....do it for yourself and your kids.<br>  <br>  You sound like a wonderful mommy who has a lot to offer but just needs a little bit of help...go for it!

Get help for your sake and your babies.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I totally think you have ppd and I really really think you need to go to your doc and talk to them about this before you hurt yourself or someone else.
xZWP2mqjaa	totally up to you. Obviously if you had stitches or other problems after the birth I would wait until everything is fully healed. Having said that I waited about 3 weeks and I'd had 4 stitches! <br>  As well, if you're breatfeeding make sure you use birth control - probably condoms. You won't start menstruating but you can still fall pregnant pretty damn quickly.<br>  Be prepared for it to feel completely different 'down there' too. You've just had a baby so everything has been stretched. It will feel different to your hubby too.

z6IekuwSaa	I agree!!! Errr,  I tell my MIL that she can't smoke around my baby and she doesn't respect it. Here's the excuse she gave me and this is prolly what most people think:<br>  "Well I smoked while I was pregnant, and with all of my kids and there's nothing wrong with them"<br>  Yea, nothing is wrong with them except they were all around 5 lbs when they were born and out of 5 only 1 doesn't have health issues....idiots|`|tht0DrHsaa	I can't understand that either. I have a very dear friend that smokes around her daughter and every time they come over her daughter smells so bad like smoke. It makes me sick, and she goes to school smelling that way.    She has even had doctors tell her to stop because it was making her daughter have problems with her ears and allergies.  But that hasn't stopped her.  It makes me crazy.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I have no idea.  I have smoked since I was 14 and had my daughter at 16.  I wasn't all that smart (as you can probably tell) but even I knew not to smoke around my baby, and I was still a stupid teenager (lol).  So I guess it boils down to stupidity.|`|t5bF9MFEaa	People have been smoking around their kids for decades and decades.|`|j2mRop0laa	Too lazy to go outside or too selfish to wait till the kids are away.|`|cb5522ea5bac3ee4d8f1779895290ac6aa	Ignorance.|`|faLD7RiVaa	Either they are ignorant of the consequences of their actions or do not believe the threat to be that imminent. I am guilty of that to a degree in another way which is why I can to a degree understand their actions (however, I do not approve). When I was a child we never wore seatbelts and cramming my entire family into the cab of my father's truck ( a bench seat for 3 ) was not biggie (BOTH of my parents, my baby brothers, one on my mother's lap and the other on my sister's lap, obviously my sister and myself crammed at my mother's feet). We also survived riding down the high way in the back of my father's pick up, with and w/o the cap on, as well as rolling around in the back of the good old station wagon. My thoughts are, I survived as did all my friends who went through the same ordeal. Car seats, booster seats and seatbelts are not that big of a deal to me. However, I do adhere to the law and have them wear them, also, looking back at how we behaved, I fell in love w/these precautions simply because they keep the kids in one place. <br>  Anyway, the point is, we all have something that "we survived" and it remains in the recesses of our minds making us make light of something that may very well be something serious. These parents, even with all the evidence staring them in the face may be thinking it is hyped up and because there is currently no law protecting these children from the ignorances of society, there really is little that can currently be done.|`|rBq189W1aa	Because they're selfish and ignorant.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, selfish, ignorant people are allowed to have kids.|`|82niQjyCaa	well they are obviously clueless about damage to their babies, don't worry they are the ones causing harm not you!|`|dW4DbkCLaa	They are selfish and don't care about anyone but themselves.

3X0t8JrXaa	1st I hate your boyfriend...for the record.  Okay now with that out of the way...don't panic.  Believe it, no matter the situation I think all pregnant women have that "moment" when they freak out because everything is suddenly real (I'm 27, 21 weeks pregnant with one baby and married and I still have moments when I'm on the verge of a breakdown).  I'd look into any type of financial help like WIC...since you're on your own most likely you will qualify and that will definately help.  I'd also check with your doctor and see what preparation classes they have...a lot of them are free.  As far as baby stuff...I'd maybe go online and check Craigslist or something like that to see what you can get there that may save you some money getting big stuff like cribs and stuff.  As for your mom...she'll come around...just let that pass on its own.  Now this will seem like something really silly and you'll think "what kind of advice" but maybe you should open an account (free) on a website like www.babygaga.com.  Its other pregnant moms offering advice and venting, etc.  Its kind of helpful to find out whats normal, whats not, and get a little emotional help.  Its not as good as having a boyfriend or husband thats not a complete *** but its the next best thing.|`|ee12f86390071e6ed1ca21eb76bf203faa	it takes 2 to tango so its as much his problem as it is urs, take him to court get child support and make him get invovled with the kids <br>  best of luck hun xxx<br>  and congrats|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Unless you are going to give them up for adoption, which you should consider, you'll manage because you have to.

Half an hour is not a lot compared to how long some people leave their little ones...More like hours on end.<br>  Its awful! My daughters always been incredibly clingy, and people tried to talk me into letting her CIO....there was NO way.<br>  <br>  Oh and im not totally anti-cry it out either, i believe once their past 6-8 months they should really learn how to go to bed on their own. Sometimes it might involve crying for 5 minutes like my daughter but i never left her alone either....<br>  <br>  I cant imagine being able to physically leave my daughter on her own crying...imagine how scared they would be!!|`|PDHCOrOSaa	YOUR RIGHT!  It's horrible to do that to any baby especially a baby that is far to young to even understand why they are being left there to cry.<br>  <br>  The reason he is a vegetable is because he probably doesn't see the point in interacting or crying for ma ma since his mother completely ignores his pleas anyway.....|`|8kaDm2D8aa	that seriously makes me wanna cry, how could you do that to your baby?  horrible mother!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I would never allow that, so I would say no, it is not okay. Our son began sleeping through the night at 12 weeks, all on his own, no crying involved whatsoever. I still rock him some nights at 10 months, but I really do enjoy that time. Sure, there were some exhausting nights when I wanted him to fall asleep quickly, but I would prefer helping him sleep rather than making him do so on his own while crying alone. That just would not work for me. The motherly instincts are way too strong to let that happen.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	she should be concentrating on her childs needs more and not on how much sleep she should be having. kinda selfish to make a baby that age sleep through in my opinion. you cant make a baby sleep through they will do it on there own as its develpmental. shes wasting her time and breaking th etrust between her and her child!|`|dgRTkccBaa	No way would I do that.  I let my kids CIO at 8 months and never more than 15 minutes.  8 weeks seems way to young to me, and ahlf hour is way too long.  Expecting a 2 month old baby to sleep through the night is completely unreasonable, they still need night feedings at that age.|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	Babywise has been known to contribute to failure to thrive. It is NOT okay. <br>  <br>  See www.ezzo.info for more about why Babywise is a horrible way to parent a young baby (or anyone, for that matter).|`|6lBWoKrgaa	i think 30 minutes is way to long. I think it's possible for your baby to develop trust issues. Anyway good luck!|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Honestly, it depends on the parent and the baby.  I used Babywise, but if you read the book, it says in there REPEATEDLY that you must use a flexible schedule, and not be fixated on a schedule.  <br>  The book also says that babies CAN sleep through the night at 8 weeks, but that sleeping through the night is only 6 hours tops, and that 8 weeks is not for all babies.  My baby slept 6 hours straight at 8 weeks one night, then continued to wake up for a night time feeding after that.  Babywise also says to check on your baby and make sure they are not hungry, wet, warm, cold, etc., and if they are not, to put them back to sleep, not just to let them cry.  The letting them cry part is when you first put them to bed, and then later on, after you have a routine established.<br>  There are a lot of people who say it deprives the baby of food.  My little girl was a preemie, and we used the Babywise method after she reached her "due date", and she gained weight like crazy, and is now a happy, healthy, extremely active 10 month old.  Like I said, it depends on how the parent uses the book as to whether or not it works.|`|M9M6nTZeaa	This to me sounds like the book recommends sleep training... I disagree with starting this at such a young age. As well the techniques that they seem to recommend seem to be a little cold.<br>  <br>  I never had a problem with my son sleeping through the night, I didn't use any methods from any books I just used plain old motherly instinct and did what I believed would work for my little man. Every baby is different and the books tend to generalize, so while I DO read them for the advice I usually tweak the advice for what will work best for me and my son.<br>  <br>  I don't think its just you. I think that sleep training any baby under the age of 5-6 months is cruel and the CIO method is ok in moderation, however should not be practiced with a baby that hardly ever cries, or with a child under the age of 5-6 months. To me you can't spoil an 8 week old baby with too much love and feedings! I would recommend you buy your friend a copy of the book "The happiest baby on the block" This book describes the missing 4th Trimester and that its impossible to spoil a baby...8 weeks is too early to be depriving your baby of a feeding. He/she will let you know when he is ready to go longer by cutting out the feeding himself. Infants also go through growth spurts around this time, so depriving them of much needed extra food is just abuse in my books. Except for when he was in a growth spurt.... My son started cutting out his night time feedings at about 2 months and by 6 months he was sleeping 12 hours through the night without waking. He is very healthy and happy and transitioned himself into this. <br>  <br>  I hope that I helped!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I personally think it's never okay to let a baby of ANY age cry it out. I really think that when babies cry, they cry because they need something. Whether it's something that we taught them they needed.. like rocking to sleep, feeding to sleep etc. Babies have real needs and if we do not respond, we teach them from a young age that we are not there for them when they need us. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't go in if the baby is moaning and groaning, but if the baby is actually crying, of course I go in. Young babies can't yell "Mommy come and get me! I need you!", them crying is trying to communicate with us - trying to tell us something.<br>  <br>  I find it sad that they're letting an 8 week old baby cry it out.. that's disgusting. Of course that's NOT right!|`|uMIvRRjoaa	You've seen the danger of babywise in person. That is just so sad. No newborn should have to cry for 30 minutes to have their needs met. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ezzo.info/Aney/aneyaap.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezzo.info/Aney/aneyaap.htm</a><br>  Babywise advice linked to dehydration, failure to thrive<br>  by Matthew Aney, M.D.<br>  Expectant parents often fear the changes a new baby will bring, especially sleepless nights. What new parent wouldn't want a how-to book that promises their baby will be sleeping through the night by three to eight weeks? <br>  <br>  One such book, On Becoming Babywise, has raised concern among pediatricians because it outlines an infant feeding program that has been associated with failure to thrive (FTT), poor weight gain, dehydration, breast milk supply failure, and involuntary early weaning. A Forsyth Medical Hospital Review Committee, in Winston-Salem N.C., has listed 11 areas in which the program is inadequately supported by conventional medical practice.The Child Abuse Prevention Council of Orange County, Calif., stated its concern after physicians called them with reports of dehydration, slow growth and development, and FTT associated with the program. And on Feb. 8, AAP District IV passed a resolution asking the Academy to investigate "Babywise," determine the extent of its effects on infant health and alert its members, other organizations and parents of its findings.<br>  <br>  I have reviewed numerous accounts of low weight gain and FTT associated with "Babywise" and discussed them with several pediatricians and lactation consultants involved.<br>  <br>  The book's feeding schedule, called Parent Directed Feeding (PDF), consists of feeding newborns at intervals of three to three and one-half hours (described as two and one-half to three hours from the end of the last 30-minute feeding) beginning at birth. Nighttime feedings are eliminated at eight weeks.<br>  <br>  This advice is in direct opposition to the latest AAP recommendations on newborn feeding (AAP Policy Statement, "Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk," Pediatrics, Dec. 1997): "Newborns should be nursed whenever they show signs of hunger, such as increased alertness or activity, mouthing, or rooting. Crying is a late indicator of hunger. Newborns should be nursed approximately eight to 12 times every 24 hours until satiety."<br>  <br>  Although demand feeding is endorsed by the Academy, WHO, and La Leche League among others, "Babywise" claims that demand feeding may be harmful and outlines a feeding schedule in contrast to it. The book makes numerous medical statements without references or research, despite that many are the antitheses of well-known medical research findings. In 190 pages, only two pediatric journals are referenced with citations dated 1982 and 1986.<br>  <br>  Many parents are unaware of problems because the book is marketed as medically supported. It is co-authored by pediatrician Robert Bucknam, M.D., who not only states in the book that the "Babywise" principles are "medically sound," but also writes, "'Babywise' has brought a needed reformation to pediatric counsel given to new parents." Obstetrician Sharon Nelson, M.D., also warns: "Not following the principles of "Babywise" is a potential health concern."<br>  <br>  The book's other author is Gary Ezzo, a pastor with no medical background. Ezzo's company, Growing Families International (GFI), markets the book as "ideally written" for "obstetricians, pediatricians, or health-care providers to distribute to their patients." (GFI promotes the same program under the title "Preparation for Parenting," a virtual duplicate with added religious material).<br>  <br>  Though "Babywise" does say, "With PDF, a mother feeds her baby when the baby is hungry," it also instructs parents to do otherwise. In a question-and-answer section, parents of a 2-week-old baby, who did not get a full feeding at the last scheduled time and wants to eat again, are instructed that babies learn quickly from the laws of natural consequences. "If your daughter doesn't eat at one feeding, then make her wait until the next one." <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the schedule in "Babywise" does not take into account differences among breastfeeding women and babies. According to one report, differences of up to 300 percent in the maximum milk storage capacity of women's breasts mean that, although women have the capability of producing the same amount of milk over a 24-hour period for their infants, some will have to breastfeed far more frequently than others to maintain that supply. Babies must feed when they need to, with intervals and duration determined according to a variety of factors in temperament, environment, and physiological make-up. Averages may fit into a bell-shaped curve, but some babies will require shorter intervals. (Daly S., Hartmann P. "Infant demand and milk supply, Part 2. The short-term control of milk synthesis in lactating women." Journal of Human Lactation; 11; (1):27-37). <br>  <br>  Examples of the many other unsubstantiated medical claims in "Babywise" include:<br>  <br>  "Lack of regularity [in feedin|`|E6Qo6jSJaa	Just thought I'd add a different perspective to many of the answers above. We used Babywise for both our first 2 kids and are now up to our third. We personally love it. It gave us and our baby structure. Our kids, from our perspective anyway, are lovely kids and I don't think have been deprived or slow in anyway. They sleep at night, we sleep at night and we are all happy because of it - and we love our kids to bits. We also have had other family who have used it and love the program. The program has been 'condemned' by many but these opinions make no difference to us, if it works we will keep using it! I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with crying/sleeping etc. and getting their baby (and you!) into routine. <br>  <br>  I think half an hour is too long to attend to an 8 week old, but this seemed to have been just once and I am also assuming that he had been already fed, changed, clothed, cuddled, and given wake time as babywise would have advised. If the baby is now getting good night sleeps 99% of the time this sounds like a positive rather than a negative.|`|ovBNlMTsaa	What your idiot friend should be reading is a book by the Sears called "the baby book"  <br>  You can NEVER EVER spoil an infant too much, and when they cry they should be picked up, they need to know they are secure and they can TRUST someone to respond to their needs...letting an 8week old cry for half an hour is NUTS!  The baby obviously has a need that should be met, whether its food or to be held...<br>  That is a  very delicate stage in development and the child's personality will suffer later on...how can the child trust others when the mom ignores it because she's selfish and wants him to sleep thru the night?<br>  Thats LAZY PARENTING WITH A FANCY LABEL.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I didn't support book burning until I read Babywise. It should be banned and the writer jailed. It is a DISGUSTING way to treat a baby and any parent who can heartlessly do that to their child should be put in counseling because they have serious emotional issues. It is dangerous and cruel and you can see for yourself what the results are.|`|rFtKFp03aa	We didn't follow Baby Wise ( I didn't know thats what were doing ) when our babies were little, but I read the book recently, and essentially that is what we did.. <br>  <br>  They cried it out in the middle of the night if they woke up... but never more than 5 minutes and they feel back asleep.. This is when parenting comes into play.. you know your child and what they can / should handle.. we never had any big crying bouts.. <br>  <br>  The book also talks about schedules and proper nutrition during the day.. <br>  <br>  My babies are all big now ( at 9 months old ) and thriving ..... sleeping through the night didn't affect them because they were and are getting their nutrition during the day.. <br>  <br>  Make sure friend is feeding her baby every 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours during the day... the Book also says that... <br>  <br>  The book works great when you follow it properly ... all the moms in my mother of multiples group who followed have healthy normal thriving babies who sleep through the night.. <br>  <br>  They other moms tend to have babies  who wake up every hour to eat, they don't nap, they have to be held while sleep the moms never get a break.. which is fine -- but with multiples that is hard to do.. <br>  <br>  ** Just an observation in OUR group.. not saying with all babies *** <br>  <br>  Anyways, I think you should ask your friend if she feeds her baby frequently during the day and then let me know.. I am really curious... <br>  <br>  My babes slept through the night between 3-4 months ..<br>  <br>  Im not saying Baby Wise is good or bad.. I am just saying you need to take what you read and make it your own... no ONE book fits all your needs... I think it is best to become well educated over all and them make your decision on what you want to do..

Good luck with Aurora and Nathaniel!!|`|QSodlfMraa	i when i have my baby in june i do plan on breast feeding|`|qBtTAgBqaa	Although I am not a teen mother. However I did have my first son at 19yrs old and breastfed him for 14months. Anyway, I am a mom of twins. and I breastfed them.<br>  <br>  My best piece of advice for in breastfeeding your twins, get the book "Mothering Multiples" by Karen Gromada ( www.karengromada.com )  This book is invaluable with it's knowledge. I can't tell you how this book saved me. Made breastfeeding my twins so much more enjoyable. It gave me a sense of determination. And a lot of it really helped me understand a lot of things when it comes to mothering twins.<br>  <br>  Do you have the EZ2-Nurse twins nursing pillow? Great great nursing pillow.<br>  <br>  Best wishes and congratulations!!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I really really wanted too but there was a few reasons I couldn't. <br>  a- My breast were to large, and my nipples to small<br>  b- my postpartum was so horrible that I could barely hold my daughter. So i went in to the doctors and was put on anti depressants and the ones that i was put on i could breast feed. I had to make the decision on if being with my daughter and raising her was more important then being her source of nutrition. <br>  <br>  I suggest you get nipple shields and the cream for it.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	i'm sad to say i don't. i did for a few days, but gave up due to a lack of knowledge, advice, and a decent health visitor! i sure will next time though!|`|AA10015577	Good for you hun!<br>  <br>  I was 19 when I had my first and breastfed for 15 months!

kiAQi91laa	Relationships are complex.  You are absolutely right, you're father and mothers issues shouldn't stop him from seeing you and knowing you.  Now do you know why they the broke up before you was born?  Maybe there was so much arguments between your parents and sometimes words can really impact another person.  <br>  <br>  My mother kept telling me and how horrible my father was to her and we should just forget him.  She'd say he was a drunk and a womanizer.  I thought to myself that he might have been a horrible husband to my mom, but he's wonderful around me.  Through years my mother complained so much about him visiting me and my siblings that he actually backed off.  <br>  <br>  Give your father a chance first and if anything ask him, "Why don't you want to know me?  Is there something wrong?"  You'd get the answer.  Even though you don't have a strong relationship with him or any at all...it still can be built.  A relationship takes time to grow, but you need to give it a chance and so does your father.  If you both are in talking terms ... try not to place the blame on one another or to your mom.  Start fresh and take time.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	I really, really feel your pain.  My dad also left my mom when she told him she was pregnant.  He probably doesn't want to know you know because it'll bring back the pain of whatever the situation was that caused him to leave in the first place.<br>  <br>  My dad lives on the other side of the country now.  He's come back once, and it ended terribly, terribly badly.  Honestly, if your dad wasn't man enough to stay with your mom, you shouldn't want him to be there for you.  I know it's an impossible thing to do, but realizing that fact helped me get through my childhood.
2pxiK9waaa	Doesn't matter. Genes work in weird ways. The only way to find out is to do a paternity test.|`|T48smu01aa	MM for one or two of you that said it was not likely for a kid to come out like that with a black it actually is.....very rare but its possible.....I watched a program on couple who were either white or black who had opposite children.....like ths white couple who had twins and one came out white and one came out dark skinned it was something in the genes it also happened to a black couple who had a white lil boy I think it was it was there child just a different couple.....anything is possible best thing is for that girl to get a blood test to find out who the father is.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Could be she has stronger genes and the baby can change as they get older.  My niece came out really really dark and within a month became very very fair-skinned.  I've known of mixed race babies that come out very fair skinned and then later pick up color.  As far as the eye color...I'm full black but bright eyes run in my family...everything from blue to green.  Honestly black babies don't come out black...contrary to popular belief.  I came out very pink and looked white with curly hair (not to mistaken with nappy)...I never really picked up much color but gained freckles...my hair is still curly not "rough" like people assume all black people have.  My brother came out a yellow color (not jaundice just light-skinned) with straight hair...he's a medium color black man now with curly hair.  I wouldn't necessarily say this isn't his baby...all mixed babies aren't fair-skinned, sandy colored hair babies.|`|yVAdjc6caa	I have a friend who is white with blonde hair and blue eyes and her husband is black, their little girl is very light skinned with blue eyes and blonde hair *the hair is curly and rough like black people's hair, but it is just blonde. And she is the prettiest little girl! She's gorgeous. So, yes, it is definately possible!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Genetically it is not impossible for the baby to come out more white than black, but is is likely? No. If I saw a couple like this, I would assume the baby was not the black guy's.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Anything is possible...|`|stRWElvPaa	well I do know a darkish skinned arab who is married to a white european woman, and you would expect their baby to be Mediterranean looking, but she has the blondest hair and pale skin and eyes!<br>    It is definitely the fathers trust me (of the above couple)<br>    But I understand why you ask this because most biracial black-white babies are in the middle, with light brown skin.<br>    As well as that, as she was messing around, the black guy has a right to demand a dna test, and if she doesn't like that she can only blame herself no wonder he has doubts.<br>  <br>    I hope everything turns out well.|`|CFFuFof1aa	Well, there needs to be a paternity test done. Poor baby!!!|`|5h8bYsKdaa	ive known a mixed lady who had 2 kids with blonde hair and blue eyes and light skin. anything is possible
4E2BoVptaa	First of all, it can take different lengths of time for different ppl. It took me 2 years to conceive. I know a lot of women that take years like that. So, it's not uncommon for it to take a while.<br>  <br>  She may need to see a doctor. There are various reasons that women have difficulty conceiving. Most of the reasons they can test for!! Also, she might try loosing some weight and exercising. That helped me a lot. <br>  <br>  But, various birth controls can have different affects. You'd have to ask your doctor how long they stay in your system, or if there was any risk of infertility with those types of birth control. I don't know enough about those to give you advice on that part.<br>  <br>  But, don't loose heart. Get tested and keep trying!!|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	it can take up to 18 months for the depo to leave some people's systems.|`|stRWElvPaa	when did she get her last depo shot, a year ago I'm assuming? I read that it can take up to 9 months to a year just for your cycles to return and then they have to regulate, so she may only have just got regular periods again. If I was her I'd try for another 6 months and if nothing was happening I'd ask the doctor why. <br>    good luck to your friend.|`|n24githIaa	She needs to count 14 days after the first day of her last period... that's the ovulation day.<br>  The next three days she will be ovulating, meaning the ONLY time she can get pregnant.<br>  Tell your friend not to use any lube.<br>  Most lubes have a spermicide in them, meaning they kill sperm before it reaches the egg.<br>  Use natural lubrication. I tried the white of an egg, and it totally worked!<br>  Good luck. Trying to get pregnant is a very frustrating experience for some women.|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	i've heard stories of the shot taking up to a year and a half to wear off all of the way.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	i'm going through this right now i took depo for 7 years and in july last year  me and my fiance decided to start trying to have a baby i have been unsuccessful when you take depo you stop ovulation and it can take up to 1 and 1/2 years for it to return  also you ovulate for about 36-48 hrs so if your not having sex in that time frame you won't conceive also my doc says taking the pill for two months then stopping will make your hormones work correctly again i'm not in a super hurry so i haven't tried it depo is a long term birth control and should not be used if you want to have a baby in the next two years i hope this helps a little
CFFuFof1aa	Yes it's very possible. Wait about four more days and take a pregnancy test. The one that I think picks up early is either First Response or ClearBlue Digital Test. If they come out negative and you wind up being a day late for your period take another one. Make sure you use your morning pee, because it will have the highest HCG levels. Light cramps (like period cramps is normal, that could be the implantation) and discharge is normal too. I had the whitish discharge through my whole pregnancy. Matter of fact, that's how I knew that I was pregnant the last time. Good luck, and baby dust.|`|sDdgyyXbaa	It is very possible you are pregnant. We are also in the same boat as yourselves. Some HT will not give you a positive until you have a missed period. Some won't detect it until a week after missed period.

I'm sure there is a possibility of pregnancy, and menstrual-like cramps are a big sign of it, but since your period is due in a week it could be that as well.

That way she still has the comfort of you as she goes to sleep, and you can have your own bed back and get a more satisfying sleep.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	You need to talk to your mother about it. That is not something that you should have to deal with. I mean no offense by that, but it isn't your job, your mother took on the responsibility to care for her when she adopted her. It isn't good for you to miss sleep at night and what will happen when you go off to college? I would see if there were a way to get a couple twin beds in the room. You can talk to her at night and even help to put her to sleep, but then move to your own bed. That way when she is moving around it isn't interrupting your sleep.

(mi papi ya falleció y creo imposible que se acuerde de él ya que mi hijo tenía 5 meses cuando paso)  Lo que si creo es que todo ni?o tiene su ángelito de la guarda|`|DhGxgFZDaa	Yo creo que si, todos tenemos un angel que nos cuida y los bbs con almas nobles y puras y ellos si pueden ver a su angel guardian.|`|JupMrw5aaa	HOLA!!<br>  SEGúN L?A CIENCIA DICE QUE SóLO SON MOVIMIENTOS INVOLUNTARIOS DE LS MúSCUOS DE SU CARA, PERO YO TE DIGO QUE HACE 4 A?OS NACIó MI HIJA Y CUANDO ELLA TENíA SOLO UNOS DíAS DE NACIDA, Ví QUE SE ESTABA RIENDO Y SU MIRADA ESTABA SOBRE MI HOMBRO, VOLTé A VER HACIA MI HOMBRO Y ALCANCé A VER UNA PERSONITA DE UNOS 15CM  TRANSPARENTE, Y LOS CONTORNOS DE SU CABELLO RIZADO, SUS ALAS Y SUS PIERNAS ESRAN DE COLOR  BLANCO LUMINOSO.<br>  JURO POR MI HIJA QUE NO ES MENTIRA,Y FUé UNA EXPERIENCIA IMPRESIONANTE.<br>  AHORA YA NO CREO TANTO EN LA CIENCIA.BESOS|`|OX8LKNjfaa	yo creo que no, no por que no crea en los ángeles si no por que los ni?os peque?os de 0-5 a?os son egocéntricos. es así como cuando un bebe balbucea solo lo hace por el placer que le produce oír su sonido o cuando son mas grandes y hablan solos lo hacen por que aun son egocéntricos incluso cuando se ve hablando a 2 ni?os de 3 a 4 a?os realmente no hablan entre ellos sino que cada uno le cuenta al otro sin importar lo que el otro le diga.<br>  <br>  si bien es verdad que ha veces los ni?os tiene amigos imaginarios, cosa que es completamente normal  es super importante darse cuenta que puede ser por que el ni?o tal vez no tiene mucho amigos de su edad y esta necesitando de ese tipo de relaciones sociales.|`|PjRrafpkaa	Debe ser asi.... mi hija charla mucho sola y los nombra...

rsOeXLq7aa	I think Parker is totally manly!! I've never heard of a girl being named Parker, and if I did, I'd think it was awfully masculine.  I think names that are also last names are pretty cool for boys, they're also really manly sounding... for example:<br>  <br>  Hudson<br>  Lawson<br>  Palmer<br>  Jones<br>  Penn<br>  Ackley<br>  Abbott<br>  Creighton<br>  Archer<br>  Carson<br>  Hollister<br>  Campbell<br>  Easton<br>  Holden<br>  Brighton<br>  <br>  And all that stuff about kids being cruel on the playground, well they're going to be cruel no matter what.  Kids with names like Matthew and Christopher are going to get picked on just as easily as kids with trendy or unique names.  It's not the name that matters, it's child's personality that will determine if, who, when and why he is picked on.<br>  <br>  Besides, all that stuff is just when they're young.  He'll be a grown man the majority of his life anyway.  It seems all kids these days have much more unique names than years past, so it's going to take a lot more to get made fun of for a name.|`|0owa0uSHaa	That is my brothers name!!<br>  <br>  I love that name!!|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	How does Parker sound girly? <br>  <br>  Parker is a great name IMHO for a boy OR a girl. i consider it a unisex name- in that i see no defining line between masculine or feminine qualities in the name. what about Adam Parker now that sounds adorable..errumm i mean "manly!" lol<br>  <br>  by-the-way i really don't get all this crap about "newer" names triggering bullying. considering how MANY kids have "newer" names these days, they ALL would be different DUH!<br>  <br>  not to mention, names are not the only thing kids are picked on for, hair, clothes, accent, walk, ANYTHING is a target. Bullies will bully no matter what. get over it.|`|4U973JfHaa	I like the name Parker!  Tell him to watch Desperate Housewives - one of Tom and Lynette's boys is named Parker.  I don't think its girly at all.<br>  <br>  Adam is also good, but a bit overused.|`|Bh3QeLaoaa	Parker is really really good! Like Peter Parker from Spiderman!|`|tht0DrHsaa	I think that it is cute. It all depends on the middle and the last name. Sometimes the cutest names just won't go with the last name..|`|hh892gJfaa	Very very bad.<br>  It's a surname. NOT a given name. A surname.<br>  Don't use it. Please.|`|oCn5skKjaa	Parker is a fine name, but if your husband doesn't like it, it's a bad name for YOUR son.<br>  <br>  |`|Qe9FmH8raa	It's better than Samantha!|`|PXYfwvsCaa	parker is an awesome name and its not as common as Adam |`|xZPHZBQgaa	Parker is a great name for a boy. |`|sPeAdxr3aa	 So you guys should compromise like Parker Adam or Adam Parker!! Best of luck!!!|`|XmO3nFSLaa	Parker is  a good name... I really like it and it sounds manly enough to me!!|`|16BnjXmkaa	Parker is a good name.|`|qBl07nnUaa	I like both Parker and Adam. They are good names.|`|TyvyBOKDaa	I like that name|`|L53HPvVNaa	No way i think Parker is very cute...good choice!! :]|`|AA12366012	It's not girly at all. It's not even unisex. It's a perfectly acceptable boys name.<br>  <br>  However, I don't like it at all, so I'd never use it. I don't really like Adam either.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could do like some others suggested and go with Adam Parker.|`|2UWP4D38aa	i think parker is very masculine..adam is just more common.|`|7c1e13d1803f914436b1e38fa99e1506aa	I like Parker and Adam. Both are very boy names!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Adam Parker is fine<br>  <br>  Parker, I do not think sound girlie<br>  I think Parker is masculine<br>  <br>  Parker I think is cool<br>  |`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Parker is masculine and a very good boys name. I've never heard of a girl named Parker. Compromise...I like Adam Parker (with Parker as the middle name.)<br>  <br>  Mymost favorite surname as a first name is Donovan.<br>  <br>  BTW all Parker is a TERRIBLE girls name.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	its ok but i would maybe use it for a middle name and not a first |`|OHfZFR31aa	I don't think there is anything girly about Parker. It definitely sounds like a mans name.<br>  <br>  But since your husband doesn't like it, cross it off the list and find names you both can agree on, as he is not going to change his mind once he dislikes a name|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I know a guy named Parker, actually. I like that name...|`|7CKipTZOaa	I think Parker is a strong unisex name, not bad at all|`|zwaXYoRbaa	Parker isn't girly,...what it is is preppy.<br>  .<br>  It's those guys who join the crew team, normally come from well to do white families and wear their monogrammed sweaters knotted about the shoulders.<br>  I agree with your husband about needing a manlier name. But I also like the idea of last names as first names.<br>  .<br>  Franklin<br>  Harrison<br>  Grant|`|AA10409800	Is he going to public school?  Then, yes, it's terrible.<br>  <br>  Guys with last names for first names get pummeled at recess.<br>  <br>  What is with new parents?  They have this need to pass on their bloated sense of self-worth on to their children.  Either that, or they think that giving their children a normal name will somehow doom them to a life of mediocrity.  <br>  <br>  Trust me, if your son's name is "Steve" or "Christopher", it's not going to stop him from being president of a major corporation someday.<br>  |`|RtIGiGrkaa	Parker is very cute for either a boy or a girl, and Adam doesnt remind me of a manly man at all lol. Why dont you suggest Parker Adam? That rolls of the tongue good. OR what about Preston Adam. That is very cute! Good Luck and Congrats!|`|GgPUVe7qaa	Parker is a nice name and so is Adam. Adam Parker, perhaps?|`|omfxPGyraa	I think it's great if your planning on making him a valet Parker!  Kids are cruel.  Consider this when naming the bambino! |`|ENWrHP3Raa	How about samantha! lol:)|`|AA12238474	My best friends son is named Parker - Its a nice name!|`|CApnEZ83aa	Great name.  Not girly at all
CxCigxZIaa	Tell your brother that IF he were ANYONE else that what he did would be considered a FELONY (as in jail time) it's called EXPOSING himself to a MINOR!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	remind him that maturbating is normal and healthy, but is done in private.  he can use his bedroom or the bathroom with closed doors.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	The first thing you should have done is tell you parents! You're little brother watching that could cause him serious issues, and if your step brother wasn't embarrassed about doing that in front of him, he may be disturbed enough to sexually molest him.<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents RIGHT NOW don't wait|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Errr masturbating is normal. Most Tennage guys do it and....in front of his 4 year old brother!? DAY-UM your going to have to talk to him about that.|`|GnfQNvyRaa	tell him that you'll cut his tail off if he does that kind of crap again!!!!....that stuff isn't cool
QfYGhtVwaa	Don't worry too much. I have several family members (boys) who seemed to be of short/avaerage stature at about 13 and then suddenly grew up taller than me (Aunty at 5' 1") and remeber that boys continue to grow longer than girls, maybe up until 21!! You are hopefully on the cusp of your major growth spurt!, you may experience pains in your shins as you stretch in the night - but hey ho, you will take a painkiller and be happier!!.|`|UA8zGGTsaa	You cannot change what your body does, or how it grows.<br>  <br>  <br>  But your body grows best resting. So the more sleep, the faster your body grows.|`|a0p16oJTaa	That's about average height.  I'm 16 and 5'8".  There's not much you can do.  Drink milk and eat vegetables.  I don't know much else.  Exercises wouldn't do anything.  You can't just "stretch yourself".  You're average height.|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	There is nothing that you can do to make you grow. Trust me, I'm pretty short and I've tried everything and nothing works. You should be hitting your growth spurt pretty soon, though!|`|CxCigxZIaa	There honestly isn't an answer for this. (sorry)<br>  However, with proper exercise and nutrition (meaning eat lots) you will grow. I can only promise you that YOU will GROW. <br>  It'll probably happen over the summer... <br>  :)|`|MgMsMExPaa	Any exercise will help you grow some . But your body is planning the growth right now, so eat correctly to help your body Store what it needs for you growth spurt. If you are interested in sports stay active in them if not try some weight training exercises or martial arts. When you start to grow try to remember to sleep and drink plenty of water. Both of these are very important. Good luck|`|yX74jO7Daa	You should stretch alot and probably drink alot of milk. Milk will  probably help your bones develop ,but I dont think your  that short for an 12 year old. Most likely you will start to develop more when your 13,14,or 15.|`|OrxI3t3saa	lol im 5'5 and im a mexican (there shorter than most people) <br>  and im 12 <br>  but its ok|`|ISljRZIRaa	just wait. u will grow but give it time.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Dead lifts, abdominal leg raises and leg extensions promote direct skeletal stress (stimulating new bone formation) and greater hormone releases.<br>  <br>  About 10-12 hours of sleep is good.<br>  <br>  All ways keep a positive outlook on things too.<br>  <br>  <3: There ARE ways to grow, but not magical, and certianly not fast. You can also slow down growth plate maturation, but once again, not fast or magical.
JIxAVONXaa	You shouldn't get her ears pierced by a gun because they are dirty for one. No matter what any person at Claire's or jewelry store tells you they can NOT be sterilized and they hardly ever even properly sanitize those guns. Secondly the noise the gun makes is dangerous on an infants ears and third it is not your body, let the child make her own decision on something so frivolous and superficial. Why cause pain in a child who never even asked for it?<br>  <br>  Also infections and longer healing times are associated with infants and young children, and with gun use.  <br>  <br>  The biggest problem with gun piercings and healing times is the way it is done. A gun simply pushes a blunt object (the earring) through the ear pushing aside the skin that was in that spot, your body will naturally try and push that skin back out of the body, extending the healing period.<br>  <br>  If you are going to get her ears done though go to your doctor. It is a quick (and much less painful) procedure to have it done in a sterile environment with a sterile needle. The needle will not only eliminate the noise the gun makes, is far less painful, and cleaner but actually removes the skin and tissue that the earingg will be replacing speeding up the healing time and causeing less infection.|`|966w9UQTaa	It depends. Most places will let you have it done from about 3 weeks. However, you should wait until she's had all the vaccinations.<br>  But ...<br>  <br>  DON'T DO IT!<br>  Let her decide if she wants to have it done herself.<br>  Don't pressurize her into looking pretty from such a youn age.|`|fhZTsEn3aa	Claire's at the mall will do it at 2 months...or after they've had their first round of vaccines. I waited til my daughter was 3 1/2 months though. She did great! They did it one at a time so I could hold her head so she wouldn't turn it. She cried less than when she got shots! It's been about 5 weeks now and she doesn't even know they're there (she hasn't since probably two days after getting them pierced).|`|YkzPfyp2aa	My daughter got her earrings pierced when she was 3 weeks old at a local jewelry store.<br>  However, the doctors suggest you wait until the baby has her first shots before getting ears pierced.|`|Cfou70TOaa	Im pretty sure its six months and a lot of people go to Claire's to have it done :)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	a friend of mine got her little girls done when she was 5 or 6 months at claires. most places want them to be at least 6 months.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i know some people may think its bad to pierce a babys ears but nearly every girl/woman has their ears pierced at some point, its not the worst pain in the world but it does sting! i got mine done when i was about 5 or 6 and i really wish that my mama wouldve just done it when i was a baby lol! if i ever have a little girl i will have her ears pierced when she is an infant.|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	6 months old! =]|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Why subject your baby to unnecessary pain? I had my ears pierced when I was an older child and asked for it to be done. The last time I had my ears pierced (for the third time) was when I was 19 and it was painful for three days. It is going to hurt your infant. Not to mention putting your baby at risk of unnecessary infections. If the earring comes out when she's at age where she is putting everything in her mouth, than you have a potentially lethal choking hazard.  She could have an allergic reaction to the metal. There's the risk of injuring the ear lobe if she pulls on the earring or it gets caught on clothing and so forth. There is also the risk of keloid formation which is basically a large scar/scar tissue around the piercing. Where I live, there are a lot of beauticians and also tattooists that will not piece a baby's ears. Morally, I believe that the earliest age you can have your child's ears pieced is when they can make that decision for themselves.<br>  "Although some parents like to get their baby's ears pierced as early as possible, the American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend that you "postpone the piercing until your child is mature enough to take care of the pierced site herself."|`|8kaDm2D8aa	4months & don't do it in a mall, please.  they can't sterilize the equipment completly.  have your daughter's dr do it.|`|TczFL0p0aa	6 months and we got hers done at people's jewlery.|`|f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	My daughter was 3 months and it was done at walmart.
WPI0Z47saa	I hated them. That liner never held everything and it leaked and was a mess. I wanted to help the earth too but I am sorry but I can't do it this way. They are awful especailly with the younger babies who go more often and do not have solid waste.|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	I just started using them on my 2.5 month old.  I have used them for a week and really like them so far!  I haven't had a major blowout diaper yet.  I have heard from others that they don't do well at night, but I used it last night and had no leaking whatsoever.  I also thought I would dislike the flushing thing, but it is REALLY EASY.  I love them so far...might think differently in a few weeks though.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  ETA:  BTW he is exclusively breastfed, so poopy diapers are especially runny.  But if you keep on top of changing, I don't see a problem.|`|ovBNlMTsaa	Earth friendly??? What's next, organic lint?<br>  EDIT: This whole organic thing is ridiculous and has gone overboard<br>  if you care so much about the earth stop driving your car lol
uBvd2BZxaa	You 20 and your wife is pregnant? Baby, yaw shoulda used birth control of some kind. Chillins shouldn't be havin no chillins.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Ensure that your wife finishes college. Education is the key.
Nh1ZZz89aa	Yes, it could be normal, and if you are on bc it should be safe, but why not use a condom? Pills don't protect from disease. You can get pg anytime, but you are right, the closer to the end, or the beginning of your cycle should be saftest, but since you are on the pill I would not worry.|`|clZNh1VWaa	birth control just like condoms and whatever else are not 100% protective. not to mention im sure this boy hasn't had an STD test. and if he claimed he was a virgin he could still be positive, you can get STDs other than sex. So wear a condom take your birth control. <br>  bleeding is normal, everyone is different. Get checked every 6 months for diseases.|`|UwwNpgntaa	well thats what happend to me and a few days later i got my period i got it earlier than i shouldve.but it could also b the other way around like in your case. thats what happend to my friend and she even took a preg test but she wasnt pregnant and got her period a few days lter.  wait 1 more week and if you still dnt get ur period then better go take a pregnancy test.|`|h8fdSWDMaa	Heyy ,<br>  <br>  Well because your on birth control and your careful with your pills then you shouldnt be at risk from being pregnant. I hope the boy was clear because you should be really careful about getting stds. <br>  <br>  It is normal to bleed your first time. =)|`|dWnN7mBPaa	How far away from your period you are doesn't mean anything. I was on my period when I got pregnant.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	You shouldn't bleed a lot, he was probably being too rough. A little bleeding is normal. If the bleeding stopped, you are okay. BC or not, you could still get an STD, and pregnancy is not ruled out no matter how much protection you use, no BC or condom or combo of contraception is 100%.
8GeNdCsIaa	def not apples but pears cus they are pretty mushy, bannanas.|`|X6as2nOAaa	No from a baby jar they can you don't just give them to them.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	They can have them pureed but don't do oranges yet because they have a lot of citric acid which a lot of babies are allergic to plus it can upset their stomach terrible.|`|dgRTkccBaa	No, at that age they should be peeled, cooked and pureed.  Citrus is also a little to acidic for them that young and can cause diaper rash.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	no, small pieces could get stuck in their mouth..|`|bMvAmMTaaa	even if they could, they don't have the teeth for it!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	NO! but they can eat them pureed!|`|uB4ZQOEDaa	try mashed banana or puree apple and pear - citrus may be a bit strong yet but can be offered as a very diluted fruit juice drink.  good luck|`|08a1322a8b7849e448d2bb758fb41239aa	No it's not healthy for their stomach to ingest food like that just yet to much acid in the food could do damage to their stomach, try those cookies they leave a mess but it works really well.|`|HtXYyZPqaa	My daughter sucks on seedless grapes in a little thing that looks like a pacifer except it's mesh. :-]|`|eZAz6orMaa	if its mashed up|`|hcwp2mAyaa	with what? they dont have enough teeth! they can have pureed apples and pears but not oranges until older.
CXgPkEPFaa	get violent if they attack you first if you atack first you get in lots of trouble.<br>  <br>  if your school is strict about fighting dont unless you dont mind suspension|`|RIv5dtihaa	talk to the principal|`|MDmpNumVaa	Im in the 8th grade as well, and have been bullied lots of times. One don't start the fight if that happens, let the other person start and defend yourself. Two when they're around you just act bigger than them and act alot tougher than they are. and Three try not to let any of the teachers or principal know because then your screwed, unless you don't mind getting suspended. Good luck :)
DuLhv7Ajaa	Great another kid out of wedlock that's going to have a screwed up life!|`|gHR4vlcDaa	ya but you will have to sue for paternity first ! But its rare here in Michigan that is for a the birth certificate to be be left blank, it called in the social work profession "the no bastard rule" we would rather a women but a random name down than have no name at all!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	yes she can still go for child support but if the man claims he is not the father the court will order a DNA test. once the DNA test comes back the judge will go from there.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no she cant, unless hes proven to be the father. if he is he has equal rights to the child and quite rightly so every father deserves that chance..unless of course they are a danger to the child.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	yes but they wll MAYBE do adna test you could say he wasnt there for you to sign the birth certificate.. because he has to sign it to give baby his last name|`|AA11784984	Yes she can. All she has to proove is he is the father.|`|4smxkg9caa	Yes. But then they'll do a DNA test and if the man turns out to be the father, they will automatically put his name as the father on the birth certificate. It doesn't matter if the child has his last name or not. You can name your child Bob Smith if you want. Once the man is found to be the father, though, he has every right to go after visitation, etc.|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	You can have the birth certificate changed to name whoever.  You can file a paternityy suit too.  It wont go into effect until he agrees or dispute parentage.  But even if he does, you can still put whatever last name you want on the birth certificate!|`|ybexjS2Paa	Yes, he is still the biological father therefore he is obliged to pay child support.<br>  <br>  Edit: of course it must be proved that he's the father.|`|gdCqKl89aa	He can request his name be added to the birth certificate after the DNA test is issued and proved to be his child in court. Then he can make his child support payments contingent on you adding his name.|`|4hSUePTqaa	A child has to have a father on the birth certificate. Thats what they told me. there responce was every child has a right blah
SEzIkGNiaa	It might of been a joke, it might have not been a joke.  HE is the only one that knows the answer, so why don't you go ask him?  Or, if your too shy to do it, get one of your friends to ask for you.<br>  <br>  =]|`|Qydtjz2naa	Well, he was probably just kidding around.  I have guy friends that say they love me, I don't take it as anything.  I tell people I love them all the time, I don't think it's a big deal, as long as everyone knows that they mean it as friends.  I'm guessing he was just kidding.  If he liked you, he probably wouldn't be so blunt, most guys wouldn't just say "I love you" seriously if they actually liked you.|`|H6LxeWZfaa	well, he might have been saying he loves you out of that me loves you very much as a friend.<br>  or maybe, he was just joking.<br>  or maybe he really does. noone can really tell and noone could know the true answer but HIM.<br>  confront him and tell him if he's kidding, because it's making you confused.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	If you're just really good friends maybe he means love as in I love my best friend, or I love my mom, or I love my brother.|`|zLoIkjoJaa	say it back to him as a joke and see what he does|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	hmmm, my psychic abilities tell me that he was joking.<br>  <br>  seriously, ASK HIM!  be a bold girl and go for it.|`|o5HyQ1ebaa	they just do that to get on your nerves unless he said that in private and romantically then ask him if he is gay and tell him that ur his friend and u are not gay
WPI0Z47saa	Because their systems aren't fully mature yet so they go alot. Their bodies are still learning to process the foods. When they are really young and on a liquid only diet, formula and breast milk are extremely easy to digest so it comes out quicker.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	it's normal for babies to poop each time they eat. their stomachs are soo small, and breast milk and formula are so easilt digested, it just comes back out.|`|yw7AeZn2aa	Newborns who are breastfeed poop at least 1 or 2x a feed.  This will slow down considerably in the 2nd month and by the time they r 3 mos old, a bout 1-2 x a day.

If he said something or walked up to you- I'd be scared,but it's nothing to scary..We have tons of neighbors who watch kids- they're just making sure they don't get hurt or whatever.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Yeah you're paranoid. Gosh who knows if he was even watching you? He might have just been outside looking around. Now if he said anything to you or made any creepy or obsene gestures, that'd be reason to worry.|`|H6LxeWZfaa	yeah, kind of.<br>  i mean, i can see if he called you over or said something disturbing.<br>  he might have just been outside chillin and seen you and looked.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	go with your gut|`|zLoIkjoJaa	my neighbor (one house up other side of the street)one day just sat in a lawn chair and stared at me with the creepiest smile but i just keep playing basketball but i know how you feel it weird<br>  im 15|`|aRCKguzDaa	ur not too paranoid. i would probably do the same thing. he probably thinks teenagers are hooligans and was wondering what u were gonna do when u went out.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	yeah you are paranoid my neighbors are always outside and obviously tney look over theyve never given me a reason to freak out youre paranoid try to calm down hun|`|dYy1b6j6aa	He was just watching you. You're paranoid.|`|xK75gTz9aa	maybe he wish he was as young as you are, because he's old!|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Don't worry, I would have done the same thing.

cHrPyTokaa	I would talk to her doctor cause she should have a few her teeth by now. My daghter was 6 months when he got her bottom 2 teeth|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Why haven't you asked your dentist? I mean, you and your other kids go every six months, right, so at the earliest you were there when you had a 14 month old with no teeth...|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Have you talked to her doctor about it?  He or she would be the best person to talk to about it.|`|yw7AeZn2aa	Im sorry but that is really late and could be the sign of a bigger problem.  You need to take her to a doctor/dentis/or clinic if you dont have a doctor.  Is everything else growing?  This os from parents.com<br>  <br>  "The first tooth can come in anytime between 4 and 12 months. If a tooth hasn't come in by 1 year, there's probably still no reason to worry if your child is growing fine otherwise -- he may just be a late bloomer. In rare instances, lack of teeth is a sign of metabolic disorder, but if that were the case, a child would have other growth problems as well."<br>  <br>  From babcenter.com:<br>  <br>  "However, if there are still no signs of any teeth coming through after he is a year old, talk to your doctor or health visitor who will be able to check that all is well."|`|zQAWuMN4aa	At 20 months old a child should have at least the top 2 & bottom 2, if not more. You should ask your doctor about this.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm sorry but wouldn't the pediatrician have caught this problem already??|`|MUVdG9n1aa	I would ask her doctor or take her to the dentist and ask him.|`|1M2gua5naa	Ask your doctor.but my daughter didnt get teeth till she was 15 months old. And they came in slowly. Its strange but the ones I breastfed, their teeth came in slower than the 2 that I didnt.
IOU6zo9Raa	That was a perfect answer (second)|`|3CVfUiiJaa	What?  I'm not understanding your question at all.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding or not breastfeeding has nothing to do with teeth coming in or not...if that is what you are wondering.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	breastfeed the baby and take the children with teeth to the dentist.
8kaDm2D8aa	i waited the 6 weeks & it still burned.  i had 2 stitches.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	6 weeks. I waited 4.|`|AA10976444	You should wait till after your 6 weeks check up and get te ok from your Dr.  I waited longer...we had sex at 6 weeks, and it still burned.|`|rjVALevtaa	Most doctors recommend waiting until after your 6 week postpartum checkup. Although I've noticed that many couples don't wait this long.<br>  <br>  After my first son, I waited 8 weeks. I had to have stitches and I tore quite a bit during his birth.<br>  <br>  After my second son, I waited 4 weeks. I didn't tear at all giving birth to him. After 4 weeks, it was pretty uncomfortable and overall not a good experience. After 6 weeks, it was much better.|`|YlLmAADraa	the doctors say 6 weeks so that you can have your 6 week check up first but if you feel up to it then you can go ahead whenever you feel like it. I had a c-section so i waited 4 weeks cause its not like my crotch was sore or anything.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	they say at least 6 weeks. i did it about 2 months after because i hadn't stopped bleeding until then.|`|VCCKfT3taa	6 weeks is the norm. The reason is that when you give birth your cervix opens up and dilates to let babys head come out, but then it takes a long while to go back to normal. <br>  While it's stretched open there is a higher chance of foreign particles entering the uterus. The motions made during sex can actually push any bacteria or stuff up and into the womb, making sex potentially dangerous till your doctor okays it. <br>  Believe me though, for most of those weeks, you probably won't even want to.|`|N4U2oKwEaa	Technically you are supposed to wait six weeks, if you've had a vaginal birth, that is.<br>  But I know a lot of women that didn't wait nearly that long, and they had no problems.<br>  If you "can't", or don't want to wait that long, talk to your doctor before you do it.|`|AA11197832	Well regardless of how you delivered (C-Section or Vaginal) doctors recommend atleast 6 weeks.  Wait till your 6 week checkup and go by what your Doc. says.  But if you must go before then, be careful and only do what you can do, If it hurts then stop.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	You really are supposed to wait until you see your doctor and get the go-ahead, usually 6 weeks.  We only waited 5 weeks, though.|`|cHrPyTokaa	Your suppose to wait 6 weeks. But I waited 2 weeks after I had my son & 3 weeks with my daughter. If you think your ready then you can, but if your scared it would be best to wait|`|jsjkTEokaa	I've managed to get out of it since giving birth 9 months ago. Hope my husband doesn't read these answers - I told him it would be at least a year! ;-)|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	They say 6 weeks for a good reason, anything before then risks serious infection.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Once you stop bleeding and are brave enough. Doctors say six weeks. I would stick with that if you had an episiotomy.|`|1M2gua5naa	The doctor tells you to wait 6 weeks because you have a greater risk of getting pregnant. If you have a vagina with good elasticity then your fine days after birth. If you have stitches then you should wait. But you DONT have to wait the whole 6 weeks. Use condoms and be safe. I NEVER waited. And I am a med student so I know that your cervix is completely closed hours or less after birth. But it is best to wait atleast until your bleeding has stopped. You can all give me thumbs down if you want but your probably uneducated in this particular area of medicine. <br>  <br>  Its your choice though. I know many who have children less than a year apart.|`|5c500787631901c9ca4d11eaca666897aa	I waited exactly 6 weeks--was ready to go as soon as i left the dr's office! LOL had a normal vaginal delivery with 2 stiches but was ok, just a little dryer than normal (sorry tmi but be prepared!)
kouvKvjSaa	if he was willing to hit you while pregnant and endanger your unborn daughter then whats the difference now? i would personally never send my kid to mexico with an abusive person, whether he has ever hit her or not. what if she did something and he got mad? what makes you think he wont hurt her and you certainly shouldnt go either! mexico's laws are different and i dont know what you would do if he beat you half to death while you were there. i say, eventhough i do believe men should have the right to see their children, he signed that right away when he hit the mother of his child, especially when you were still carrying her. she'll understand in the future especially since she's gaining a great dad anyways. blood doesnt matter. i grew up not knowing my blood father, but i do have a dad and i dont miss my father because i never knew him and i dont have much interest in knowing him now. i think you will deeply regret it if you let him remain in her life or yours. move on.|`|PkZxBGReaa	An ex-boyfriend has no legal rights. An ex-husband does.<br>  <br>  You need to evaluate what you really want to do. Do you want to get back with him? Do you want to get on with your life and get with this new great guy?<br>  <br>  If you do not want to be with him anymore and want nothing to do with him and if he is very serious about wanting to be in your baby's life, then do not go to Mexico and do not send her down. If his name is on her birth certificate, once in Mexico, he can make it very hard for you to bring her back to the states with you if he so chooses.|`|uJJPFJoyaa	He does have rights to see his daughter. I don't know what you mean by not meaning legally because he does legally have rights to see her. If you take that away from him by not allowing him to have contact with her, he can legally take you to court and settle that their. But if you feel that he is not supporting her in any way, you should than do it the correct way and legally settle it in court because if not he will always have a right to want to be there.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	He was deported so as far as I am concerned he has no legal rights.<br>  Morality wise I think he does not deserve any consideration either.Apparently he is not a responsible human being and can direct his anger towards someone else.Are you Mexican? They always put family ahead of reason,is why  ask.That's why they believe he has rights.|`|rBq189W1aa	Legally? Yes. Morally? I wouldn't be going out of my way to let the guy see the kid, that's for sure.|`|723QHuicaa	I believe he has rights until he signs them away. I guess it really depends on where you live. Contact a family lawyer, they should be able to tell you where you stand.|`|AkFag8tNaa	If you don't mean legal rights, I'm not sure how to answer. Any father (provided his intent and actions are not damaging to her physically or emotionally), should have a place in the child's life). If he beat you, especially w/a baby in utero, that should be brought up at any custody hearings you might attend and supervised visitation might be appropriate. Any child has the right to know their paternage, whether the dad is a scumbag or not.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well if you don't mean legal rights then i don't know what you are getting at. legally unless he signs off on parental rights then yes he has rights. other then that i say morally does he have a right to her? no Absolutely not. someone who can beat a woman who is pregnant with his child deserves to be castrated and that's about it. if he isn't even willing to help support her in anyway and if the only thing he is interested in is getting back with you then i again do not think he has any rights. since he has been deported to mexico i wouldn't even worry about it. i would make sure that you as the mother have full custody so that he can never come back at you and try to take her away, other then that i would pretend like he doesn't even exist he seems like a waste of space to me|`|lGKq9NXbaa	no. definitely not. Do you want your daughter growing up around an abusive man? that's irresponsible. what matters is your safety and your daughters safety. do not send her to mexico and don't go there yourself. abusive men never change and when they don't have a wife to beat anymore they move on to the kids. trust me.|`|AA10976444	Best advice...do not go to Mexico, or let your daughtergo.  You may want to consult a Lawyer, and find out your rights.  If he was deported, that means that he has no rights in the US...talk to a lawyer and protect yourself and your daughter.|`|BBtw9cmXaa	He probably does.

The medication may have something to do with the severeness of the pain, but nothing else. <br>  <br>  If the pain keeps up, or gradually increases you should definitely talk to your doctor not of what you think you have but of the pain you're experiencing so he can diagnose you if there's a need to.

You just gave birth a month ago so your circumstances and hormones are all crazy.  I don't know why your doctor told you that.  You should probably be fine.  It's effective up to 5 days after having unprotected sex (or protected not working in your case), but most effective if taken within 24 hours.  You are very fertile since you just gave birth.  Are you breastfeeding?  If you are nursing every two hours and having had your first post-partum period yet, you are in a safer zone.  Good luck!

W6S6WpsNaa	Well, I have had 3 babies, and another on the way, in about 6 weeks.  Every one of my deliveries was different.  They are all worth it!  With my first 2, they had to break my water.  I was just having contractions when I went in.  With my 3rd baby, my water broke on its own. So I went to the hospital, and the nurse told me I was having contractions, but I didn't feel them at all.  So they gave me the Epidural, before I really started feeling them, since they also decided to give me a dose of Pitocin to get my labor going.  All I can tell you....  Everyone is different.   Alot of us can tell you our experiences, but it will be different for you. CONGRATS!|`|xZWP2mqjaa	during labour, go for as long as you can before going to hospital. do housework, ironing, go for a walk round the block. cos once you get into hospital it could drag in and you'll wish you'd stayed home a bit longer.<br>  during childbirth, lots of liquids - blood, amniotic fluid, possibly (probably) poo, pain. do what they tell you - push when told, stop pushing when told - v.v.v.v. important this one, as i pushed again and ripped resulting in 4 stitches. they were more bloody painful than giving birth! <br>  after childbirth, be prepared for the placenta to come out. kind of forget about that once baby is out. in the uk we are given an injection in the thigh to bring it out quicker and then they show it to you - if you want to see it. also, fairly quickly afterwards we are encouraged to be up and on our feet and get in the shower to clean up. you will feel very weak. your legs will be like jelly and your hubby might have to help you in the shower.<br>  also, make sure you have got maternity pads, not normal sanitary towels. you will bleed heavily afterwards and will need these big mattresses between your legs!! You will feel very tender for a while and if you do get stitches they will sting in the shower.<br>  the magazines will not tell you all the gory bits but i wish someone had told me because i was so unprepared for the whole, actual childbirth process. i went into shock afterwards, my blood pressure plunged!! Within an hour (providing there were no problems) you will have already put the whole process behind you.|`|I6qfoJaiaa	Okay, before labor begins you tend to feel anxious, lots of energy most women clean, achy in lower back and hips, emotional. Contractions are hard to notice until later on, not all women find them painful. Only 15% of women have their water break before they are in active labor. Once your water breaks you continue to leak till baby comes. It's normal to bleed up to 6 weeks after baby, pain level differs depending on the women and the birth. Epidurals don't always numb everything. Best thing you can do is be informed and on the same page as your dr. Don't be afraid to speak up.|`|CFFuFof1aa	Ok, well, to be honest, the last few weeks of pregnancy are the worst. You are miserable, hot all the time, and you can't breathe good due to the baby not letting your lungs expand all the way. But that is all worth it, I promise. When you see that baby for the first time you will be so excited, and happy and you will honestly forget about any of the labor pains and all that. Now for the labor, I had to be induced. But they broke my water and it was the weirdest feeling. It feels like you are peeing on your self continuously. It didn't hurt when they did that. The contractions can get painful but they aren't too bad. I got an epidural after being in labor for 3 1/2 hours, and believe me they are so worth it. I didn't feel a thing. Didn't have any pain at all. My arms were sore for a few days after because when you are pushing, you are pulling with your arms(pulling your legs). It's a little painful down there for the first few days, but if you keep it clean and take the pain medicine they will give you, you will be fine. It was sore down there though for about 6 weeks. I tell you giving birth to my daughter was the best thing that I have ever done, and I'm trying to conceive another one right now.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	These last few weeks are the longest as you are getting so anxious right about now, right? Soon you will be getting a test done called the GBS. The dr will take a vaginal and rectal sample to test for Group B streptococcus. Then after that you just wait for labour. I had 2 c-sections and my first one the incision got infected and I had home care for 6 months after to help me heal. I just had my 2nd son 6 months ago via c-section and this one was fine. I can't comment on a vaginal delivery because I have never been through it. If you end up having a c-section then take all the help you can get at home. It is very soar and you will need help. My 1st son had his cord wrapped around his neck twice and when he was born I seen him and they quickly took him away because he was having trouble breathing. He was hooked up on wires and stuff for a while before I could even hold him. I am not sure what else you want to hear but if you need more info on c-sections I am your girl!!!|`|nlteggWIaa	pain ,stress and blood and in most first babies nothing will be straight forward but as soon as labor starts you forget about all of that and just get on with it . don't be worried hun its all worth it in the end it must be as im on my 3rd good luck|`|azE51WGRaa	What are you nervous about? Labor? Ok, well I'm going to answer that for you..Once either your water breaks or you are having contractions (it feels like someone is squeezing your midsection so hard that you have a hard time breathing) that are 5 minutes apart or less, coming at regular (but closer) intervals, and lasting longer (or if they're so hard you can't talk through them), then it's time to go to the hospital! When you get there, you'll check into Labor & Delivery, where they will print out a wristband, make sure your info (i.e. spelling of name and birthdate) are correct, and put you into a room. Then a nurse will come in, put the baby monitor on you (this monitors the baby's heartbeat and your contractions. It's just a little round disk that has straps that strap around your belly) and check your cervix to see how much it is dilated and how thin it is. If it's usually dilated 4cm or more, you'll be staying to have your baby. If your water broke, then you'll be staying to have the baby as well. If not, then you could either be asked to walk or you could be sent home. If you will be staying, then at that point you will be given the option of pain medication (epidural, IV meds, etc). You will also have an IV put in to prevent you from dehydrating during labor and to give you meds if that's the way you want them. If you want an epidural, they will send in a specialist to do one for you. Be warned that they will also have to put in a catheter (goes in your urethra to drain your urine) because your legs will be numb and you won't be able to walk. If you water has already broken, then they will monitor and check your cervix every 15-30 minutes to see how far you've progressed. If not, then they will break your water and attach little monitor pads on top of baby's head (this is a more accurate way to monitor the heartbeat. They're just little sticky pads and don't hurt the baby..It isn't even sticky enough to pull any hair if the baby has any..They do this once the water is broken (even if it broke at home). After that until it comes time to push, it's just monitoring the progress of cervix dilation, contractions, and baby's heartbeat. When it's time to push, if you have an epidural, you probably won't feel when the contractions start. So a nurse will tell you when one is coming and tell you to push. After your baby is born, the doctors will clean it up and administer the apgar test (they check for color, breathing, skin tone, etc). While they're doing this, you may be asked to push again to push out the placenta (called the afterbirth). After the baby is cleaned and does the apgar test, he/she will be given to it's mommy! Good luck and I hope this gives you an idea of what to expect.|`|wK4kqhHkaa	The last few weeks are uncomfortable but exciting. I had really bad hip pain and a cold in the last week but all sorted itself out just in time.  I went into spontaneous labor. I woke up at 1am my waters had broken.  Contractions started about an hour later and they were very strong and close together.  Contractions are a very intense indescribable feeling- unlike anything else i had ever felt.  I was already 5cm dilated after only having contractions for an hour, so the midwife said she thought i could do it without an epidural.  I had gas and a shot of pethadine.  At one point i was almost going to skip the pethadine shot and go straight to the epi but luckily i had my beautiful husband to kindly suggest i should try the pethadine shot first.  He knew i really didn't want to have an epi.  Im so glad he did- i had heard that pethadine didn't work.  It worked a treat for me- it took the edge off the pain long enough to get me through until the end.  The contractions are the hardest- the pushing is easy, and i didn't even think it was painful( compared to contractions).  After about an hour of pushing i had a beautiful little girl.  As soon as i had pushed her out i told the midwives and doctor that it wasn't that bad and i could do it again lol. I had grazing which needed stiching (didn't really hurt i was on cloud 9) and when they help push the afterbirth out that hurts but only lasts a minute or so.  The good thing about once you go into labor is you know its the beginning of the ennd.  It is hard work but you know you'll get through it as billions of women have before you and at the end you have this beautiful perfect little person that you made.  Life will never be the same again and you will experience a whole new type of love. I now think people who don't have children really do miss out on.  I was worried about a heap of stuff like bleeding afterwards and wearing a pad( which i ABSOLUTELY hate).  My mum said that i wouldn't worry about it when the time came, i swore to her that i still would.  She was right everything i was worried about seemed to fade off into some distant place because  i had much better things to think about.  Being a mum is harder work then i had ever imagined- constantly challenging and there is always a problem to solve but the most worth it thing you'll ever do in your life.  Try not to worry about stuff and enjoy the rest of your pregnancy because it doesn't last forever.  Best of luck with th rest of your pregnancy and becoming a mum
9ARNK0Bzaa	The chances of someone becoming pregnant without actual intercourse are really really slim. Also, you will not get pregnant if your genitals touch through underwear. <br>  <br>  Please don't worry about it, it will only delay your period and this will make you worry even more ! I know it sounds silly, but always make you wash your hands after having sexual contact with your boyfriend. This will, at least, put your mind at rest ! And will also get rid of any sperm that may have ended up on your hands.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps -x-x-|`|uJJPFJoyaa	If his sperm did not get in contact with your vagina then you are most likely not going to get pregnant, unless your finger was wet & oozing with sperm and you inserted your finger in yourself than yes there can be a change you are. As for rubbing up against each other w/ clothes on, its highly unlikely . I wouldn't worry as much if i was you.|`|pWDYcBA7aa	It is very unlikely that you can be pregnant but sometimes it ca happen... Miracles happen...lol<br>  But I highly doubt that you are...|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	You're not pregnant. <br>  <br>  I would suggest getting on birth control since it seems you're close to having intercourse.|`|r9Cuqpw7aa	Don't freak out, he didn't ejaculate onto your junk, and sperm doesn't go through underwear.

There is a slight chance of pregnancy if you are fooling around through clothes, but only if semen has soaked through both of your clothes AND got into your vagina. Highly unlikely!<br>  <br>  And semen that was out in the open for 4 hours would not be viable. Once it is dried up, it cannot get you pregnant. Some will tell you that once it hits the air it is dead, but that's not true. It's when it has dried.<br>  <br>  I linked a site below you might want to check out because it has lots of good answers to questions like these. So it might be worth looking into. :]|`|9hrJfhIIaa	You're not pregnant. Before you go any further in your sexual exploration I'd recommend getting a book on sex to learn more about it.
b6EyFLgUaa	I think it depends on the party. At a park no way, we know what can happen to kids when some one isn't looking- no matter the age. The mom is to busy getting everything set up to watch all the kids at a park. If its at a home and only a few hours id stay and help out. If it was an all day thing or a sleep over id leave, after I talked to the host or hostess and asked them about leaving. I was left a birthday parties as a kid and it was kind of expected.<br>  <br>  EDIT- im 21, my daughter is 2 and right now there is no way id be leaving her at any kind of party.|`|AA11296044	I do it, I have 7 year old twins.  I usually know the parents of their friends via the various play groups, play dates and school functions.   If I am comfortable with the parents then yes I will leave my children there.  (I sometimes find it irritating when certain parents stay around as you need to provide them with refreshments and snack and make sure they are comfortable, all the while trying to manage a dozen 7 year olds)<br>  <br>  I usually offer to help the other moms prepare, or mind the kids at the party, however my offer is almost always declined.<br>  <br>  I find that most moms are too busy watching the kids to worry about entertaining the adults.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	My daughter went to parties alone since she was 6.  I may stay for a little while (10 or so minutes) and have a little chat with the host, just to get to know her and see how well my daughter adjusts, but then I scamper off.  I don't see why I shouldn't, she needs to learn to socialize without Mommy hovering over her, no offence.|`|in7qi4oZaa	As long there's a lot of adult supervision I do not see a problem.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	unless i see someone shooting up - i leave them.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	of course leave him!|`|G5RxyMUKaa	i would never leave my kid......|`|F6lZHRkVaa	We've done it. Sometimes we stay, sometimes we leave. I don't think it's a big deal. I know when I start having parties for my kids, I'll want to have a couple of adults around but I wouldn't need *all* the parents to stay.|`|j2mRop0laa	My 6 year old would never let me leave her because she would only want to play with me anyhow.<br>  <br>  I left my oldest when she was about 7. <br>  <br>  My children behave and don't make a bunch of work for parents. I can trust they won't be a burden.<br>  <br>  If I didn't know the parents well, I would stay.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	I, too, would never leave a 7 year old alone at a party.  If there were a lot of parents there, or only women, I would tell the hostess that I would be waiting in my car.  Unfortunately, some look upon a party as a free "baby-sitting " service. For those who think it is no big deal, I wonder what they would think if the child got injured and they were not there.  I call it Parental Responsibility.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yup, all the time. The responsibility for looking after the children is the parents of the birthday child.<br>  It's actually more fun with all those other parents hanging around!|`|IjcdwJiMaa	as long as there is a trusting adult there it really shouldn't be an issue but i hope she told the parent she was leaving, also if i dint know the person then no i wouldn't|`|egqveuPjaa	When I was 7 I was always left at parties and nothing bad ever happened...
T48smu01aa	GO TO THE DOCTOR......OR WAIT TO START :)|`|y360AXDmaa	If you've been having sore breasts for a month<br>  you REALLY need to see a doctor and get a blood test to determine pregnancy<br>  It sounds like you are since you've had the boob tenderness for a month, BUT do you have other symptoms?
lnsOJ3GBaa	Well, sounds like you have everything you need. Maybe you could tell people to donate to a charity in your name for your birthday. It's a great way to pay it forward and I'm sure your friends and family will be impressed by such a mature move. Good Luck to you. Happy Birthday and God Bless. <br>   <br>  P.S. If you need some ideas for a charity, here are some: <br>  <br>  March of Dimes - <a href="http://www.marchforbabies.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.marchforbabies.org</a> - For Premature Babies<br>  <br>  World Vision -  <a href="http://media.worldvision.org" rel="nofollow">http://media.worldvision.org</a>  - To help fight hunger for chldren and families all over the world <br>  <br>  You could also do a search for charities to help under priviledged teens in your area on Google.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Yeah, I have no idea what I want for my 16th birthday either, it's so hard. I think you should just ask for money so when you want something you have the money for it.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	You sound like you pretty much have everything you could want.  I have no suggestions.|`|eLu3HKzaaa	well you could try an ipod touch or a wii I have a wii and those things are awesome... My whole family uses it and they love it too...|`|sCKJzcNpaa	a boyfriend
IOU6zo9Raa	The hospital should send you home with some receiving blankets. they make the best swaddle blankets. you may want to purchase a few in different colors designs ect. maybe 2 or 3 packs of four or something like that. They also sell "swaddle me" blankets that velcro closed for a little more money. I never bought fleece because my babies get too hot. 12 weeks, is what? June? Don't do fleece unless your in alaska.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	The difference between swaddle blankets and fleece blankets is that swaddle blankets are strectchy so you can swaddle the baby pretty tightly in it, and it stays put better.  <br>  <br>  As far as how many to have, that depends on if your baby spits up a lot,  has explosive diaper frequently, and how often you are up to washing clothes.  I had three,  I bought 2 prior to having my son, and the hospital gave us one.  Three was more then enough for us.  I would say 2- 4 outta do it.  Don't get too carried away,  because their is a chance your baby not even like being swaddled, some babies don't/|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You will _need_ zero. You may choose to have one or more. Not all babies like to be swaddled, and even if your baby does like it you can use an ordinary baby blanket.<br>  <br>  Don't throw money at things you may never use. Babies are quite expensive enough as it is :)|`|kdSuwt8paa	Aim for about 6.   They are so useful even when the baby is not swaddled any more!   You can use them as change mats when you are visiting and as light weight covers not to mention sunshades in the car or pram and protection for your own clothes when cuddling the baby.  And for people who think only people in Alaska in June need one - there is a whole southern hemisphere having winter in June......|`|IXBl5l5kaa	We didn't really get the whole swaddling thing until about 2 or 3 weeks after our daughter was born. Nobody showed us how until my mom.<br>  <br>  We bought 2 Kiddopotamus swaddle blankets and that worked well for us. One was always clean if the other got dirty and they are only $10 a piece and work better than regular blankets.<br>  <br>  We still use the large size swaddle blankets and our daughter is 8 months. She has just always slept so much better swaddled. We have 2 of those as well.<br>  <br>  (I think we have the microfiber style. Fleece may get too warm in the summer time. Microfiber or cotton will breathe easier)|`|sw2R5A9iaa	2 minimum -you can swaddle a babe in anything.  this includes a shirt or jacket.  relax and just enjoy parenthood.|`|wBpennsMaa	You don't need any.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I wouldn't go overboard until you find out if your baby likes being swaddled or not. My baby girl HATED it! So I just gaveaway my swaddle blankets (the ones that are made by kiddapotomus)<br>  But the blankets like the hospital swaddles them in, you can not get enough, you use them from regular blankets-burpclothes. You can use those for everything you can think of!|`|PxvRob35aa	Hi. Yep. Just get a normal sheet for a moses basket. Wrap her or him up in it and there you go. Swaddled. Fantastic idea. Im still doing it on my five month old but leave one arm out so she can find her fingers. She sucks them for comfort.<br>  <br>  So your baby is swaddled and then, add another and do it again or a thin fleece. If you live in England you will get given a room thermometer and it will say on it how many blankets the baby should have on next to the temperature.<br>  <br>  They just dont like babies to be too hot. Feel her chest to see how hot she is not her hands.<br>  Relax and Enjoy but definately swaddle.|`|MsD8Zibuaa	I have tons, I use just regular receiving blankets. My daughter was really into being swaddled, but I use them as burp clothes, and changing mats, and tons of other things, they really come in handy. I would recommend 4-6. I have about 15, but that's way too many, I just happened to get a lot at my baby shower|`|VCCKfT3taa	Srsly, I swaddled mine in a beach towel for a little while, because she seemed to like it.<br>  As for real blankets, I would 5 or 7, just in case any get spit up on or peed on and you can't do laundry.

You're going to have to work hard.|`|CFFuFof1aa	Just try getting a job. Don't let them know that you are pregnant though. Even though it is illegal for companies to discriminate against pregnant women, they probably won't want to hire some one for nine months and then have them take a leave of absence. Also go to your local Department of Human Services. They will help you get on foodstamps, WIC, and Medicaid. That will help with your hospital bills for now, and groceries. After your baby is born, they will have you come back in, and they will assess your situation from there.

It is more likely to get pregnant about a week or two after the last day of your period because that is when you are the most fertile.|`|HAueVh8Naa	well if you a normal [period its most likely not the guy from new years .its sound like your bf got you pregnant my last period was jan 22 and i am 6 weeks pregnant too :)|`|6xwdFvdpaa	i would say that it sounds like you got pregnant with your boyfriend hun has you had a proper period after the drunken sex with your friend and you will probably be around 4-5 weeks pregnant now so i wouldnt worry to much|`|uavlqBDDaa	Yes, you can.

C22jeMVhaa	First thing CONGRATS!!!! My prenatals made me very sick to my stomach. I ended up taking them right before I went to bed and then slept through the churning. Plus your body( and the baby's) will retain more of the vitamins. If they are making you constipated try more fiber in your diet. That's the only thing I can think of. Bread always helped my stomach feel better to and saltines were my best friend when I was pregnant. Good Luck|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I had a lot of trouble with the prescribed prenatal vitamins as well. They made me nauseated and constipated. First I tried switching to taking them at night which apparently helps some women, but did not work for me. I then asked my doctor if there was something else I could take so I could keep them down and he actually had me take the chewable flintstones vitamins during the first trimester. It turns out the prenatals just had too much iron for my system to handle. Just ask your OB if there is another option for you, they will work with making you more comfortable.|`|S4DNQkFraa	The prenatals make you constipated, but the other symptoms are because you're pregnant. <br>  My prenatals did that to me--constipation-- so I ate lots of fruits and drank juice and water.<br>  Try that, if it doesn't help you're doc can prescribe you a stool softener. G/L!!|`|0HMZ0DAeaa	Hi. I don't know the ones your taking, but I would highly recommend prenatal vitamins called Select OB, I believe, They are blue, and you can chew them or swallow them. They are awesome!  Yes, they can make you nauseous.  Make sure you put something filling in your tummy before you take them.  Taking them on an empty stomach or with little food will defniitely make you feel sick.  I am not sure why vitamins do that, but if you eat first then take them, usually it helps and you dont feel the nausea as much or even at all.   Good luck to you!|`|MOsStEbqaa	My pills make me nauseous as well. I take mine before i go to sleep now and i also chew on some ice and that seems to be working.
ZYlr9TSBaa	I didn't lol. I started getting irregular contractions in my back Wednesday morning (didn't think much of it cos I didn't think you could get contractions in your back) - they never got regular, not even when I got to the hospital Thursday morning but they got SO much more painful. So that's how I knew. So contractions can happen in your back, plus they don't have to get regular for you to be in labour - mine never got regular. Good luck!|`|ycdkngxlaa	I woke up about midnight with really strong cramps that came and went and when they were there i just couldn't keep still, i had to move around. They made me feel like i wanted to pee a lot and i also had a lot of pressure around my groin and bum area. When i arrived at hospital i was already 6cm too.|`|SZDbfwRzaa	i got ( i know other people who have as well) this huge feeling that i needed to poop, i was in hospital at the time, doctor asked me what was wrong and i told him i thought i needed to go toilet for the last 3 hours but nothing happens when i try, he told me i was in labour without hearing another word|`|W6S6WpsNaa	What are you feeling?
b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Has he seen a GI doc? Some kiddos are more prone to constipation and need meds like Colace or miralax regularly to help with pooping. If you can get him pooping regularly, with soft stools, then it will probably bother him less to poop and therefore make potty training him easier.<br>  <br>  If you are still having problems after he is going consistently with soft stools, ask for a referral to a child psychologist to give you some strategies.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	obviously the bowels aren't fully  mature.  continue patience and encouragement.  avoid milk products, give the child more water, and increase the fiber intake.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I'm very confused by this.<br>  <br>  So what if his bowel movements are irregular? Who are you training, him or you? If your child can't tell you he's about to need the potty, you are wasting your time. If he can tell you, whatever does it matter whether he last went six hours ago or three days ago?<br>  <br>  Months? Wait until he knows he's about to go to even try to train him. It will take a week.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old he is, but is he uncomfortable? If not, maybe it's normal for him to go every 4-8 days. You can't force someone to have regular BMs. Not everyone does. If he's happy as he is, stop medicating him, he doesn't need it.<br>  <br>  If he's not happy, have you tried something mild and simple like Lactulose (I don't know where you are, but in the UK you can just buy it, it's not a prescription medicine). A spoonful of that a day may not make him any more regular but it will stop him getting constipated.

8VlDuMFOaa	When my son had night terrors, he would look like he was awake, but he was actually still asleep.<br>  I spoke to many professionals about this, because obviously as a parent your instinct is to stop them from being so distraught, but we were told by all of them, that the best thing to do, is to let him go and NEVER wake them as this can make the situation worse.<br>  For us, my little boys eyes always seemed kind of glassy, so that is how we finally worked out that he was still asleep......and in the morning he wouldn't remember any of these terrors.<br>  <br>  It is truly an awful thing to have to sit back and watch night after night, and I completely sympathise with what you are going through.<br>  If it is night terrors and not just nightmares, your little girl will grow out of them.<br>  Good luck...I hope i have been of some help.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	If she is asking for you, then it is probably not a night terror. Children with night terrors are still asleep and do not remember the episodes.<br>  <br>  Does she end up sleeping in your bed with you? If so, then it may be partly behavioral.<br>  <br>  You can comfort her in her room till she falls back asleep. If it continues, it may need to be one of those things where you comfort her and then let her cry herself to sleep.|`|145RUNQHaa	If she is normally a good sleeper then it's safe to say that something is bothering her.It could be night terrors or  maybe she is teething.At this age toddlers can get a developmental spurt and their imagination can work overtime.Give her the reassurance she needs right now and she'll probably settle better eventually.|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	When my oldest was around 21/2 he had what I called night terrors.He would wake up screaming during the night.His eyes were open at first I would think he was awake.But he was inconsolable.We couldn't do anything for him or with him.He just cried and cried.We would put the tv on and wait it out.He finally quit doing it and sleeps fine now.|`|trxEyVRLaa	Is her cot in your bedroom?

Both of you need to do that. She needs to start getting prenatal care for her sake and the child's. This is not something you guys can hide forever and it will come out eventually. <br>  <br>  Does her father just have a bad temper or is he ever abusive towards her? If it is the former, just tell him anyhow and you will probably have to listen to him get angry, which is reasonable.

There should be a planned parenthood or something similar in your area.  Since your so young if she decides to have the baby i don't think you should keep it and try to raise it. It doesn't sound like either of you come from very loving and supportive families, your so so young, and you don't want to ruin your futures and bring a child into a negative situation. So I would defienetly suggest you consider adoption. Don't try and get adive from people  online, get help from a professional.  I hope I helped a little.|`|weu4Ip99aa	KIDS KIDS KIDS.... Kids having babies makes me so mad... especially when I try SO hard to have one. and I can't! Well all you can do now is tell both your parents and do what THEY say to do.

I wish You both luck! its definitely going to be hard for you two.

They try alcohol. <br>  <br>  Your daughter tried it and like she said it was a one time thing. And think about it, mom, she was open and honest and came right out and told you. <br>  I wouldn't punish her for trying it. I especially wouldn't punish her especially because she came right out and told you about. <br>  <br>  I would tell her that there are dangers. Like it isn't safe to drive high, that people could take advantage of you while you are high. Tell her that you are disapponited she tried it but happy that she was responsible and that you are even more so happy that she was honest with you and didn't lie to you. <br>  Tell her that you don't want her to do anything like that again. <br>  <br>  <br>  You guys were talking about pot right? And she openly told you she tried it, yes? Well, if you punish her she might be less likely to tell you things that easily in the future and keeping that line of communication open is key.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	"Try me once, i might let you go, Try me twice, I have your soul"|`|MsD8Zibuaa	I wouldn't punish her, be glad that she came to you with this information.

Don't punish!|`|sCKJzcNpaa	dont punish her. your lucky ur kid is so smart. let her be|`|DnNkCF6Taa	To be honest I am a big one on rules and boundaries and while I understand that the interest in disciplining her, I would say that at this point,it would be best to talk with her about the dangers of others drugs rather than disciplining her.  While I understand that the idea of discipline is to get her to learn not to do something, and she had tried it and it turned out didn't like it, or decided it wasn't for her.  <br>  <br>  So I think what would be best is to have her promise to you that she won't do it again.  But I wouldn't discipline her, she was open and honest with you about it, that means in her mind that you are a safe place her to go.  She knew that you probably would think what she did was wrong before she told you that she did it, so I think if you punish her now it will make her think twice about approaching you and talking to you about it.<br>  <br>  I would say the best way to handle it would be to talk to her, and tell her that you are proud of her for coming forward to you and telling you about it.  But from here on out that there is a no drug policy in the house, and because she came to you she is not getting in trouble this time.  But next time she will be getting into trouble, however you discipline in your home, from grounding, scolding, spanking... however you discipline tell her that the next time, she is going to get into a set degree of trouble, but for the moment you two are on a clean slate and that everything is okay.<br>  <br>  But also tell her that the next time the question of doing drugs comes up, she should feel free to come to you and talk about it.  She will never get in trouble coming to you an talking about it, but if she ever does drugs again, then she is in trouble.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I mean really honest.  Think back when you were a kid, if you knew you something you did was wrong and you were asked about it, and told the truth and then got in trouble for being truthful about it, would you do so next time?  .... just playing the devil's advocate.   <br>  <br>  But I think this time have her know that everything is okay and your proud of her for being honest with you.  But next time she does it she is going to be grounded for two weeks or she is going to have a hard time sitting, or any means of how you correct... She is a good kid that experimented.   <br>  <br>  I would say to hold off on the discipline this time, and just take this as a sign where most teenagers are hiding things from their parents, your daughter sees talking to you as a safe thing to do.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	If everything you say here is true, than congrats on raising a great kid. She's not quite out of the woods yet so keep up the good work. I wouldn't punish her not to any great extent anyway. However, I would sit her down for a short talk explaining that you know she's a great kid and that you're proud of what a responsible young lady she's become. However, regardless of her research, Pot is absolutely not allowed nor is drinking or any other drug. That you're happy she was honest with you but that you want to be sure that just because you have an open honest relationship doesn't mean you're ok with indulging in such curiosities. The problem with her theory on pot is safe is that the pot its self could have been laced with something without her knowing. <br>  <br>  Explain that you know she's going to find herself curious about things, and in order to keep the open honest trusting relationship that you have she's going  to need to come to you with these curiosities and you can handle them accordingly. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and your Daughter, It sounds like your a good mom, Pat yourself on the back, Good parents get fewer and farther between all the time.|`|xSEXFWJ9aa	I wouldn't punish her because kids at that age are going to try new things.  You should be glad that you have your daughters trust because if you think about it she could've just lied and you would've never known. But ath the same time I'm not saying what she did was good either. Don't punish her but talk to her. Explain to her that just because it may be a safe drug that doesn't necessarily mean she won't get in trouble for it because in the end it is illegal. Remember to be firm so she knows it's a serious matter.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|LUg9dgb5aa	Well, the fact that she told you is really good.<br>  I'll tell you the truth, if i were her, since i'm a teenager<br>  i wouldnt tell you at all. So, the fact that she was honest<br>  is REALLY good. I mean, most teens wouldnt be honest.<br>  The fact is, though. It's still a drug. It maybe a PRETTY SAFE<br>  DRUG, but its still drug. It's really not all that safe either. Although one of the safest out of MOST drugs. I'd say for now a good punishement would be just a good talking to about this. If you find out she does it again, then it leads to grounding and so on. I'd keep a close eye on her though for now. If she continues, those marks WILL go down. Good luck. [:<br>  <br>  Dont give her a huge punishement, though.<br>  I honestly dont think she deserves it. But, dont let<br>  her get away with all of it! A talking to about this would<br>  be good. And just like, no cellphone. Or something small<br>  like that.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	Most teens smoke pot at some point. <br>  That doesn't mean they are bad or stupid people, and she was probably just curious and wanted to try it. <br>  <br>  Talk to her about the dangers of getting too involved with a drug. But I wouldn't worry too much about it since she ADMITTED to you that she did.|`|ejelObdJaa	i dont think u should because if she does something wrong some other day she WON'T tell u because she's going to remember that day she told you something because she trusted you and you still punished her. let it go, it was just once.. you can still talk to her and tell her how u feel about it and that u r proud that she doesn't want to do it again. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	ground her for 3 weeks and take a trip to the police station to have them do a demonstration on what it would be like if she were caught by the cops or they can tell her what the fines are for it and there punishment, it worked on me when i was her age.|`|pOZubuOcaa	You shouldn't punish her at all<br>  just talk about it to her and explain that she can get into trouble with the law if she does it|`|H0sPCJQPaa	If you actually have to ask this.

rBq189W1aa	Assuming she's telling the truth about not wanting to do it again, I'd let it be. I mean, that's the outcome you want, isn't it? It seems that outcome has already been achieved, so at this stage you'd just be punishing her for the sake of punishing her. Not the most productive course of action, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  The last thing she needs is to be lectured to death, either. It sounds like she's already gone to great lengths to find objective information about this, what makes the respondents above think that trying to fill her head with scaremongering and propaganda will have any effect? It seems a lot of you are more upset that she's actually gone and found something out for herself, rather than blindly swallow a bunch of regurgitated talking points from somebody who's probably never even seen a bag of weed.<br>  <br>  Katie C: "Yes it could kill her"? I think you need to educate yourself. Nobody has ever died simply from smoking pot. EVER.<br>  <br>  John B: Turn her in to the cops? You'd seriously ruin a kid's life over something like this? Damn, I hope you never have kids.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Well she admitted she smoked which is good, and she said she'll never do it again which is even better. But it scares me that she believes it's a safe drug. Instead of punishing her I would sit down with her and tell her all the dangers of marijuana. Although it is one of the safer drugs out there, it is not safe and she needs to be aware of that.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	She does sound like she is respnsible.. your words will probably do more than any punishment would in this case, however, she did something illegal and dangerous and she has to know this is not ok. I would think of some sort of punishment, becasue this is a biggie.|`|Hi2WZtY3aa	I would look at the good that she has done. Do not destroy what good relationship that you may have with your daughter.|`|jbjoO4V7aa	No! it was obviously just an experimental thing. All teens do it.|`|07prVOz9aa	just give her a very long lecture on y drugs are bad for you and that if she does them again shes grounded forever|`|aiKLvwGTaa	You don't say how old your daughter is, but she's obviously more than capable of knowing her own mind and expressing herself.<br>  <br>  If she is as responsible as you say she is, then you need to trust her to make her own decisions.<br>  <br>  Punishing her is not going to make an ounce of difference. If she wanted to do it again, of course she would. You cannot patrol her 24 hours a day, and you shouldn't want to.<br>  <br>  As for the dangers of weed, I think it's a load of scaremongering. The most dangerous aspect of it is the tobacco, and like she said, she filtered the smoke out.<br>  <br>  The occassional spliff is not going to do anyone any harm. Excessive use, like excessive use of anything, will do.<br>  <br>  I've smoked weed occasionally for years. I'm about to complete my degree and become a teacher. My boyfriend has smoked far more than me during his teens, and he's now a doctor.<br>  <br>  Also, you can't punish her when she told you of her own free will. It would make your relationship lose all trust, and she will just not tell you in future.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I see it this way, at least she told you the truth. If she has never been in trouble before, then I would let this one slide. If I were to ever catch her coming home high, then yes, she would be punished. Weed is a pretty safe drug, the only side effects are happy, hungry, and sleepy. I have never heard of pot killing people like say coke does. I've smoked weed, and a water bong does not filter the smoke at all, it makes the smoke more potent. Maybe you should do a little Research. Usually first time smokers don't use water bongs, it can be a little difficult for a first timer. There is no safe cigarette, so in the end there is no safe way to smoke weed. I know people that have smoked it their entire life and are very well educated people. If you feel that you should punish her, then punish her. She's your daughter.|`|XhbzxeKJaa	I'm sure you are going to get answers taking you in both directions.  So, here's just my opinion....<br>  <br>  You know your daughter better than anyone who is going to give you an answer on this board.  From what you have said about her, and the fact that you believe her...I think it is important to show her that trust is earned.  She should be commended on her honesty.  She needs to know that she can come to you in the future without fear of judgement.  She also needs to know that you not judging her doesn't mean you not punishing her!  <br>  <br>  I too have a teenager who admitted to doing pot once.  He's a straight A student, on the football team, VERY responsible and very open and honest.  I did not punish him.  (The wrong-doing was in the past, no sense in dishing out a punishment now...that was my thinking.)  Rather I laid out the facts about the harm that smoking pot can do, no matter in what form you choose to smoke it.  I also painted a picture for him  with scenarios of how his life could turn out if he continued to smoke.  <br>  <br>  I told him that I trusted him at this point, I had no reason not to.  However, if in the future I were to find out that he did something to endanger that trust, things would definately change and he surely wasn't going to be happy about it.  <br>  <br>  I hope things work out for you and your daughter, good luck!|`|YyrLtbH3aa	I actually am a freshman myself at high schooland she sounds very sucessful.Personally I find it a little strange she would research a drug before experimenting.Most kids ,based on my knowledge would just do it as it comes up in there lives and not even care about the effects it has on our body and our future if the drug use continues.I personally think you should monitor her a little more because if you didn't know about the drug use then what else isn't she telling you.I think you should sit down and explain to her with your own statistics what drugs leads to.I think explaining the effects drugs have on a person will do the trick.Or chores based on all my high school friends,we all hate them,thats punishment enough.|`|oP504BtFaa	I would first talk to her and even if she knows the repercussions of drug use, lecture her anyways. Make it interactive, though, so she can't tune out. Ask her questions, talk with her, discuss with her. Ask her why she did it and all of that good stuff. As for a punishment, I think you could simply tighten the leash a little bit. I don't really believe punishment will do the trick though - I think education, open communication and a strong handle on her out of school activities will be your best bet.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	in this case i wouldnt<br>  she admitted it to you and she said shed never do it again and you believed her <br>  alot of teens are simply curious as to what its like without having intentions of ever doing it again (i have tried it, not doing it again)<br>  <br>  <br>  i would say to her that i understand her curiosity and she will be given some slack this time but if she does something like that again youl come down hard on her|`|AA11296044	She told you she tried it once - which mean she has probably done it more many more times.<br>  <br>  She came to you and told you something, I actually would not punish her for it, You really do want to keep those lines of communication open. <br>  <br>  On the other hand I would watch her like a hawk, hug her when she gets in the door (to smell the hair and clothing) and make sure she is maintaining her grades.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	Your daughter does sound very responsible (minus the decided to do pot), so I don't know that I would punish her harshly this time. She did confess to you, which is a good thing.If it happened again though, I would lock my daughter in her room until she was 40 :) I would let her know what will happen if she does it again. Good luck.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	no, dont punish her. she was curious, plus she doesn't sound at all rebellious and she could easily have lied about it, if you punish her she'll get pissed and is more likely to rebel.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	nope, they should legalize pot already,
rFtKFp03aa	Its hard to tell (as the mom) with your first pregnancy because you don't know what to expect.. <br>  <br>  I got pregnant the first time, miscarried, and the second time got pregnant naturally with triplets, I could tell right away that I had more than one baby... <br>  <br>  You gain weight faster and measure larger than a singleton... <br>  <br>  I would think with your history it is very possible you could have multiples.. <br>  <br>  Congrats on being a new mommy soon!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Identical twins are NOT genetic. They are a freak occurrence in which the cell splits into two. Now fraternal twins are genetic. That being said, are you more inclined to having twins just because you have them in your family? Not always.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Only fraternal twins is a genetic predisposition that ruins in families.You have the same chance as everybody else to have identical twins. Your husband having twins in his family won't up your chances of having twins, but if its fraternal twins in his family, your children could get the "twin gene".|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	There are 7 sets of twins in my family and I am at no greater risks of having twins.  Identical twins have nothing to do with family history because identical is just "a freak split" that can happen to everyone.  Fraternal twins can run in families because that requires more than one egg being released.  Eating more is normal and we all go through it.|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	well you're identical which isn't hereditary... the twins in the father's family don't mean that you'll have twins (which is what some ppl think) so you're chances are probably lower than you think they are...|`|iy8C03vaaa	of coarse they are possible..but twins usually skip a generation..so if you are one you pry wont have one...but that may change depending on the twins in his family...|`|n24githIaa	Your doctor will be able to tell you at your first ultrasound.<br>  But seeing as twins are kinda common in your family and his family, your chances are pretty good that you're having twins.<br>  Congrats!!|`|Hhd2TPL2aa	You do have a great amount of possibilities of your kids being twins but also just because you have all these sets of twins in your family doen't mean that your kids have to be twins|`|4PCLUlwUaa	yes it you are a higher risk of having twins but i would not worry about it stress is not good when you are pg.i wish you look and god bless|`|Rckz6DSSaa	In a family there isn't usually that many sets of twins, accident or not, so I think that your chances are very high!|`|weu4Ip99aa	Fraternal Twins are hereditary.... Not identical. but anything is possible|`|CFFuFof1aa	It's possible. You won't know until you get an ultrasound done though. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	your chances of having twins is quite high cos there is twins in both famillies including you as well being a twin|`|6db9f742a1916600f115b248eaa65ec2aa	Twins are more likely in your kids' future than yours but yeah its possible.

But my dad is an only child =]|`|FkGh0LuWaa	No!  I have 3 sisters and 1 brother!|`|AA11434640	Yes I am :) I don't mind it, though. I feel that it's made me slightly more mature since the majority of my life was spent in a "grown up" world.|`|iEsICA3Maa	Nope. Two older brothers.|`|222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	No way jose.

I think I really missed out, big time. I tried to make up for it by babysitting when I was 12, so I had younger kids to share things with and to play silly games with them, like you would if he was your dear brother,  and have a good time, and I treated them and loved them all like they were all my baby brother.|`|8ee4GOb9aa	Yeah! i have a half sister tho,but she doesnt live with me. So yep im an only child =P<br>  <br>  I feel i missed out on a lot tho. Like i had no one's game to go to when everyone says they are with their siblings i have really no one to hang with and babysitting kinda helped me!|`|4KF4v3Dcaa	omg- when i saw this question i was like IK my answer yes<br>  <br>  and then i remembered i have 2 sisters who dont care i exist and used to be my bestfriend!!<br>  <br>  MAN i really thought i was an only child for a second<br>  guess not|`|8XcRFF6Taa	No, I have two younger brothers.  I always wanted a sister:(  One of my brother's is gay, so that's the closest I get!<br>  <br>  Definitely glad i'm not an only child:)|`|vjKGpVEyaa	no. a step sister (annoying)<br>  A brother (also annoying)<br>  and another brother (turned two today!)|`|c7XrBgz2aa	No Im the middle child I have a older bro and a little sis|`|syVPYmXWaa	nope i have a older brother and a younger sister.|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...how would i go about finding out?!!
256cVXsmaa	Usually it's just coincidental, don't freak yourself out because that definitely isn't a sure sign that you are pregnant.  If you miss your period than take a test.  You wouldn't be getting pregnancy symptoms just yet but it could mean that the egg is implanting, highly doubtful that you feel that though.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	It could be a sign of pregnancy but it is too early so probably sign of period|`|IRZ4czGPaa	it could be your period!<br>  it is a sign of pregnancy but it doesnt happen until two weeks after conception.|`|vlbCNihAaa	ive had pain where my ovaries are once and i hadnt even had sex yet
Cg4fWi3Baa	I was 17 when I found out. It wasn't planned so at first I was in shock and then when in sank in I didn't know what to think. I was scared of being judged. I left my sons father when I was 4 months pregnant as he had a very bad temper and assaulted me. <br>  For me, on top of wondering how on earth I would ever be a mum at 17, I had to get my head around the fact I was going to be a single mum at 17. That was really hard. A few people suggested abortion and I didn't even want to consider it. <br>  To cut a long story short, I gave birth to a healthy baby boy and began to raise him on my own. It was totally worth it. I can't describe to you what it is like to hold your baby for the first time, or to watch your baby grow into a little man. <br>  Being nervous and confused happens to pregnant 30yr olds. No one just knows how to be a parent when they have a child. Its something you learn to do. <br>  As long as you take care of your responsibilities and always make your child your number 1 priority, you can't really go too wrong. <br>  Most good hospitals have a councellor you can talk to. You and your g/f could go together when she is having prenatal care. <br>  And birth education classes will help your confidence. <br>  I have never, ever regretted having my baby. It actually made me a better person too.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I became pregnant when I was 18 and ended up having her a week before my 19th birthday!<br>  <br>  Simply put, she's my miracle baby! She's totally worth EVERYTHING. Her daddy loves her to pieces and I know that he don't regret having her. <br>  <br>  We don't have her home yet, she's in the NICU because she was due in May and came on Feb. 23rd. We go back and forth between our home and the hospital. Its hard to leave. <br>  <br>  She's doing great though, she amazes all the nurses and doctors up there by how well she's doing. She was off the ventilator 3 days after being born. <br>  <br>  <br>  She's simply precious and adorable. A gift I wouldn't exchange for anything, not even a gazillion million trillion dollars.|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes it was.<br>  <br>  I love being a mother.|`|uktBnDP3aa	my friend was molested and had a syringe stuck up her vagingo full of sperm and she was i think 12 and had gone through puberty WAY early but anyway at 12 she couldnt take care of it and had to give her to me and i was taking care of her for a week before putting her up for adoption<br>  <br>  congrats! you are going t o be a father! your 18 you can take care of it dont be too nervous but i learned in one week how hard it is to take care of a baby buthang in there and dont kill gods child!<br>  <br>  i miss that little girl she was adopted just a few months after being put up<br>  <br>  you know hwats funny the girl who had her appointed me as the father<br>  <br>  it was so so hard giving up that little girl|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I was 19 when I got pregnant. Being pregnant was the easy part, but being a parent is worth it. It's the hardest thing I've had to do, but luckily I have a great support group behind me, including my husband (I was married before I got pregnant).<br>  <br>  It's definitely not something I would suggest people do before there 20's. I wish I was older when I got pregnant, for the sake of my children.|`|NopTr18taa	I was 18 when I got pregnant with my oldest son.  <br>  I freaked out, I always said I never wanted kids. I settled and adjusted. Abortion was never an option, I did think about Adoption at first because I was only 18, but I couldn't imagine myself giving away my baby. <br>  It was the best decision I ever made to keep my son. It's been VERY hard for he and I, but we've made it through. He and his little brother (I made the mistake of marrying when my oldest was 3 and had another baby.. THE MARRIAGE was the mistake, NOT my youngest son. Just to clarify) are what keep me going and remind me constantly that I can do this and I have to for them. I graduated from the first portion of college and I'm planning to take the MCAT's to see if I'm smart enough to get into med school. You can do anything and it will be doubly worth it.|`|GomqF0bfaa	YES! I found out that I was pregnant at 17 and my fiance was 18. We were both shocked (actually I was crying, he was laughing) lol, but we got through it, talked everything out. Abortion was not an option for me at all once hearing the heartbeat. A baby is just way to precious. Our son is now 6 month old, we have a house together. I managed to continue school by doing my college work online at the art institute, while my fiance works. Everything had worked out in the end and it was a very scary time of course when I found out I was pregnant because it was my senior year in high school. But the moment I held him it was just simply amazing and now I couldn't even begin to imagine my life without him.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I was scared, I cried, I was worried how I was going to do this. I got pregnant at 18, now I'm 21 and have a beautiful baby girl that I wouldn't trade the world for. It has been the most challenging thing I've done, but there is nothing like waking up to a smiling face in the morning. I used wish I would have waited a few years, so I could do better financially, but we're doing just fine. She has every thing she needs and too much of what she wants. It's all in what kind of view you have on it, if you look at it as the blessing that it is, then it'll be smooth sailing.|`|oSMNx6L5aa	I was 14 when I found out I was pregnant, very young.<br>  <br>  I decided to keep him, he was 2 months premature and he is the happiest little 8 month old now. I kept him because I felt by me getting pregnant I should take the responsibility, and it's the best decision I've ever made, he is just precious.<br>  <br>  I know how scary it can be and you need lots of support, all I had was my boyfriend and we made it through but I would've liked to feel like someone cared. <br>  <br>  People don't always understand how much stress you're going through, but I do... I can offer any tips and support if you two need it feel free to e-mail me<br>  <br>  chelsea.miracle@yahoo.com|`|3oSQQt6maa	I was 18 when i had my son, but i am a girl in case you want a guys point of view. This is for certain that you have to grow up, and grow up fast to care for the child and the mother. You have to take responsibilty. From a moms point of view, a child is worth everything.<br>  Just finish school.|`|WYOAhvVIaa	well, I'm 19. no kids. but I have friends with babies. I think whether a child was planned or not, it's a blessing. Life is suchhhh a beautiful thing <333|`|28QPS6V9aa	Absolutely!|`|256cVXsmaa	I'm still pregnant and I debate with myself every single day whether or not it is going to be the right decision to keep the baby.  So good question I'll keep an eye on this =]<br>  I'm pretty sure everyone will say yes because your baby will mean to much to you to say that it wasn't worth it and you shouldn't have kept it.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I got pregnant at 20 and that was completely frightening to me. I think being a parent for the first time is scary no matter what age you are. You are probably scared out of your mind right now, but when that child is born and you look into it's eyes, you will lose your heart. It is so worth it to keep them. I am now 26 and have three beautiful children that I wouldn't trade the world for.
r7q8LW7Aaa	No, but it doesn't mean you should go get pregnant.<br>  Remember that unprotected sex brings STDs too...|`|LVZdzPmpaa	To echo the "it's your body, it's your choice," how about your make a choice NOT to get pregnant at 17. Or 18. Or 19 for that matter. How about you make a choice to wait to have a child when you are competent and capable of raising a child so that your parents don't have to "force" you to do anything.<br>  <br>  Jeeeeeze.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	No they can not...the most they can do is pressure you or give you ultimatums and so on.  Legally they can not do anything about your pregnancy.|`|ebCzRLw7aa	No they cant.<br>  <br>  But Im 17 and pregnant, and honesty its the hardest thing in the world.<br>  I had to give up school because Im due in June so I would have to leave during exams.. so I wont get to graduate with all my friends.. this is my grade 12 year.<br>  <br>  Its so stressful, and the father of my baby is gone, Ill have to do it all by myself, yes I have my mom but thats not the same as my baby having 2 parents.<br>  <br>  Being a teen mom is not a game<br>  Go to school, graduate ON TIME. get a good job, get married to someone you know is going to be there for you and your baby.. then have a baby.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	No they can't force you to have an abortion, but they don't have to support you and your illegitimate child either! Please give this baby up for adoption if you're pregnant and spare the world of another future stripper or prison inmate.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	No, they can't. It's your baby, your body, your choice.|`|fwro8soqaa	No, legally they can't.  Actually most states have the parental involvement cut off at 16 as far as consent for an abortion.  It does not go the other way around though. No one can make you have one.  <br>     If you are sexually active, it's always a good idea to talk to your parents about their feelings on these kinds of things. It's better to have the talk before something happens, not after.|`|X9Tnpchfaa	no but you should really make sure you are ready being a parent is a full time job. there are many rewards and joyous time but there are also the trying and frustrating and even terrifying times. there is also the matter of being married to a loving spouse that will be there for you and the baby. then there is the matter of being able to support the child let me tell ya it is not cheap. Best of luck to you.|`|98WKYtfwaa	No, nobody including your parents can't force you to abort even if you were younger than that. Your body, your decision.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	no they cant force you to have an abortion. but your 17 so why would you even be thinking of getting pregnant yet|`|SaAQZiG4aa	they cannot make you have a abortion you have rights|`|ju4we8j0aa	no, they cant force you.|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	No they cant.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	no they can't it's entirely up to you to decide its your baby not theirs|`|BKUhGTHdaa	No, but it would be a good idea to.|`|5l8FjtOGaa	nope they cant.
kiAQi91laa	I'm currently in my third pregnancy.  Let me tell you this pregnancy is TOTALLY different from the last two.  <br>  <br>  I barely felt any movement with my last two and this pregnancy I've felt the baby move at 15 weeks!  I felt fluttering before then and I've been seeing & feeling her hiccups for months now.  When she does hiccup my tummy does move a little all over and it's rhythmic (a constant beat).  I went to labor and deliver for braxton contractions and she had the hiccups then and the nurses was wondering which mother's baby had the hiccups.  You're pulse shouldn't be making your belly move like that..it's your baby!<br>  <br>  I'm really not use to feeling my baby move so much compared to my other pregnancies and this particular pregnancy is actually taking a big toll on my body.  Remember they say that each pregnancy can be different from the others and we are both experiencing that with our current pregnancies.   <br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	At 16 weeks and 2 days if its right at your belly button its a little high to be the baby.  Your uterus shouldn't be that high till about 20 weeks.  At 16 weeks I was only feeling flutters but I'm extremely small...only 82 pounds pre-pregnancy.  I started to feel kicks at about 19 weeks here and there and then full force going into 21 weeks.  Honestly if its at your belly button its either your pulse OR could be be gas bubbles.  I only know because the same thing happened to me at about 14 weeks and I asked the doctor...thats when she explained the uterus thing.  Now in saying that...I'm a first time preggers soooo it could be different for a mom whose not a rookie :-)  Either way congratulations.  (Who knows, maybe you have an acrobat in there!)
xvey8ixPaa	In my opinion, both the computer and the guitar should be taken away.<br>  His bed time would be rolled back to 9:00pm for a month. I would have the computer be in the living room or the dining room in a comunal place until further notice. Maybe indefinately. the guitar would be in "time out" for a couple days, then he would be given the opportunity to EARN it back by doing extra chores and work around the house. Decide what the guitar is worth in monetary means and then make him 'earn" it back in man hours. Once he has demonstrated that he can abide by his bed time, give him the privelege of staying up later back. If he is going to act like a younger child then he should have a younger chil's bed time. This has worked in my householdl. It takes some tough love, but they learn. (the guitar would completely disappear....lock it up or put it in storage or have a relative hold it in their coat closet where he does not see it. he will look for it when you are not there!)|`|RuKK1LYiaa	not only should the guitar have been taken away but the main source of the problem should have been removed as well which is the computer, and not given back till the kid learns some respect.|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Make him grow up a little. Don't punish him yet: Make him do some work around the house (I mean serious work like chopping wood, not wiping windows)|`|sCKJzcNpaa	1030 is way to early a bedtime for a 15 year old. let your kid grow up a little and maybe hel start behaving a bit more adult|`|6OplSEQkaa	2 months
E9JigTskaa	keep taking him back to the doctor till you get answers that your happy with.<br>  your the only one who can speak up for him.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Have they done an MRI? <br>  <br>  Also, have they tested him for reflux? Those are questions to ask.<br>  <br>  Take him back to the emergency room.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	I would definitely remove dairy from his diet. I would consider roto-virus. There is no medicine he can take to get rid of it, just stop giving him dairy. My daughter had this for over a month before we figured it out!<br>  <br>  I would also try giving him all natural foods, with no preservatives. I know its expensive, but maybe it will be temporary until you figure this out. <br>  <br>  The lady that said she feeds her child crystal light-that has artificial sweetener in it. Which, in all reality is worse for your child than regular sugar. If you give him juice buy all natural no sugar added and mix it with 75 percent water and 25 percent juice.|`|5ujzs0k3aa	I feel for you , I also had gone through fighting with doctors who didn't believe me. Go to his doctor, demand a referral to see a CDC or CDRC specialist. I take my son to Doernbeckers regularly now. Don't leave the office without it. They will believe you and they will do their best to figure out the cause whether it is serious or not. It often takes a while to get an appointment so let them know it is urgent.  In the meant time try to feed him only neutral foods, like bananas, applesauce, rice and toast. Keep him aways from strong juices for a while and dairy as well.  Try to hold out just until that appointment. The first thing they told me at doernbeckers was "we believe you, you wouldn't be here if there was not something going on and we are going to find it" I broke down in tears I was so happy.  If someone tells you there is nothing wrong, tell them to refer you to someone with more expertise. That'll get'em goin. Good luck!|`|P1xlrvAaaa	My son is 2 1/2 and has had many similar issues since birth and has been hospitalized MANY times.The 1 st thing I think is either an allergy to something or acid reflux.The arching of the back as well as the blood in the stool can be acid reflux.The blood streaking in his stool can be either an internal tear in the rectum do to his stool being so hard.What you need to do is start to keep a journal of the times he is doing this is it after he eats all the time,after he eats certain things,.Also chart the behavior he does,what ( if any thing)seems to make it better.Also in the mean time before you see your doctor it would be  a good idea to help "soften"his stools a bit.Get Little Tummy's all natural Senna(a laxative all natural made for babies and toddlers) In the mean time some things to watch for are:<br>  <br>  1) vomiting<br>  2)distended or bloated belly<br>  3)hard abdomen <br>  4)if he is continuing to scream while having bowel movements-<br>  <br>  these are all things that will require IMMEDIATE attention and you should bring him back to the er right away and ask about these tests in specific:<br>  1)barrium enema<br>  2)upper and lower GI<br>  3)ultra sound<br>  Good luck I hope this helps and please e-mail me if you need any thing or just some one to talk to.|`|YKVvojF2aa	I have been in your exact situation.  My son is 2 1/2 now and as soon as he hit a year old (and we switched him to whole milk), it was a nightmare.  Everyone told me it was not dairy that was causing his constipation.  And not to sound graphic but my son would pass stools the width of a sippy cup and the length of a banana.  I felt horrible, and your right at that moment you feel helpless.  I purchased Mirilax over the counter for relief.  I am in the medical field and I know what that stuff is.  It did help only for the first month.  I tried cayro syrup, high fiber, etc.  Nothing seemed to work.  BUT, after a year of this, through trial and error, money spent on specialists visits and diaper rash creams, and dr. visits...He is regular as regular can be.  He goes atleast 2 times a day now and the only way we know is the smell.  What I did was removed all dairy from his diet.  I have decreased his starches and carbohydrates.  I changed his bread to Wonder Bread for kids and he only gets 2 slices every other day.  I took away all his juices.  (Ecspecially apple-that actually constipates the little ones), and have replaced his fluid intake with Crystal Light.  (He drinks as much as he wants because it is water!!!).  My son gets regular juice, but I buy the capri suns and he gets this as a treat.  So I am giving him this instead of ice cream or cookies.  A typical day for my son is Around 6 am he is up, so I get a cup of Vanilla Soy milk with fiber, and a cup of Quaker cinnamon flavored squares cereal.  He gets this at home.  Then at my mothers for breakfast he gets Whole wheat cinnamon flovored waffles with sugar free syrup or Jiff peanut butter and half a banana.  (Banana's and the peanut butter can cause constipation, but too much fiber can hurt, so I think this balances him out).  For lunch, my son eats usually what my mother cooked for dinner the night before if it is not pasta.  Or he gets a corn tortilla wrap heated with turkey or pb&j, or a mini pizza without the cheese.  For a snack, he gets rice cakes, or a gluten free snack.  For dinner, my son likes the vala frozen meals.  It has chicken, vegies, and some pasta. It does have a cheese sauce but I am loving the fact he is eating the brocolli, corn, and carrots in it.  The main thing that I have done is decreased his gluten, removed dairy, and added some fiber.  In the mean time his behavior changed, he is calmer, listens, cooperates a whole lot better, and he is sooo loving and actually is a pretty great kid for 2.  I did away all together with fast food.  That is no longer an option as a "poo poo in the potty" reward.  With all the money saved from fast food, he gets new Thomas the Train stuff.  For me, no more bloody stool, large stools that would hurt me as well, no more "tummy temper tantrums", no more straining, no more alternating to diarrhea.  This helped me and I just did some resarch.  I took the diet that Autistic children are being placed on, (my son is not autistic), some diets that people with IBS should be on, and a well balanced diet for a child my sons age.  Hint:  for fiber it is a childs age plus five for the grams of fiber per meal he/she should be consuming.  Hope your son gets better!|`|tqmcRE8taa	take to all differant kinds of doctars. try a chiropractor. becuz they really help with unexpected things. i hope you son gets better though. :)|`|eVY7Oilbaa	Go to another doctor as possible.<br>  I don't think those are at all good signs. Those are all signs of serious stomach conditions. I'm not sure what I can say.|`|YBzbtYACaa	i think you need a second opinion, and if that does not work then you need a third opinion....my heart goes out to your lil one... i hope he feels better fast....good luck mom!!!
1gVDZrPuaa	Photobucket has some stuff like that.|`|Q08GpskDaa	tinypic works|`|LynprVLYaa	Oh lol U already tried Picnik?|`|ywlhky4uaa	www.bebo.com , look at the apps there one that does exactly that :)
LbkLg4RFaa	Yep certainly do.  I like hearing about other mother's experiences it makes me feel less isolated and not like I'm the only one going through something.  I'd prefer an answer like "yes I've been through that and this is what I did......." over "Here is a textbook explanation of ......".  If I was after a textbook answer I'd read a book, google it or specify that is want is wanted.<br>  <br>  I can understand sometimes a link, sometimes even a paragraph, to back up a source of information but when the answer is just copied and pasted it makes me think the person is just after the points and hasn't been in the situation themselves.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	It depends on my question.....but usually I am asking a question to get others opinions or their experiences.  Sometimes I ask medical questions..and people will do that...I don't mind because sometimes people can find info that I can't.  But I know what you mean.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Oh I know how you feel - it drives me mad.<br>  When it's a very long answer, I usually just scroll down without reading and hit the thumbs down.<br>  We are all on here for experiences and 'real' advice, not something we could easily find ourselves!|`|TJusfEnlaa	Yup, i hear ya sister! i can't stand it - it is so obvious, and what really grates me is when they don't even quote the source!|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Ah it annoys me too, I mean I could do that if I wanted.<br>  I normally dont even bother to read them because they're always long.|`|AA12373801	yea that really annoys me <br>  google and wikipedia is my first step but i like to get insight from other moms|`|GxMSrrFLaa	I have one thing to say. Mystic_e... 'Nuff said.|`|caM1Syyfaa	I like answers built on the correct scientific / proved background, but also topped up with personal experience. <br>  <br>  For instance, they say the baby should sleep on her back, feet to foot and I am planning to move her from the Moses basket into the cot, yet don't know how to cover her (the blankets I've got, even the big ones, are too small to reach underneath the mattress). Would like that people who answer are well aware about the SIDS / cot deaths background but give practical advice.<br>  <br>  Copying and pasting is highly annoying, but so is giving the wrong advice just to "hear oneself talking". To summarise, I like the personalised advice with a scientific base.<br>  <br>  Expressing ones feelings is also great. Makes people feel they are not alone in experiencing smth and that they can liaise w other people, albeit unknown ones. Something like "I have been through this, it will be soon over etc." is absolutely fine, even if it doesn't provide any added value in terms of knowledge.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	No it bugs me too. I can just google it myself if I wanted to, but I want experiences from other mums!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I find them very annoying.  It's one thing if you cut and paste a little piece of it, to go ALONG with your answer, but if you entire answer is some huge long cut and pasted article, written by some one else,  it wicked aggravates me.  And it's plagiarism!  I've even read some one who put there own one line answer at the top, and then pasted a long article.  Well I actually read the article, and it completely contradicted the article.  So obviously that person didn't even read the article.<br>  <br>  Also, it's quite obvious we know how to use a computer, so I'm pretty sure everyone on here can google.  I want some ones experience, not some thing they read. (or not read)|`|lGcpXteaaa	I always specifically ask for opinions and advice. I cant stand asking stuff wanting other moms advice and then getting a page off wikipedia...<br>  <br>  Then again, if i cant find any facts by googling myself then i will ask for that too...<br>  I think it depends on the question asked but most of my questions are wanting opinions from others.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	When they're like 40 paragraphs long, yes, it gets annoying. Sometimes there's good information, but geez, it can be overkill. Sometimes if I'm curious I will look up the answer and then include certain points but just give the link. I've learned a lot of stuff just by being on here and reading other people's questions. But honestly, 90 percent of the time when I see someone do that, I skip over it!|`|yB5go5wbaa	agreed!  I can go to wiki or go to kellymom or parenting.com or check my baby books or wherever to get answers - and most of the time, when I've asked a question, I do all of that before asking anyways.  I like hearing other moms' experiences and knowing that I'm not alone...|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	My favorite is <br>  <a href="http://letmegooglethatforyou.com" rel="nofollow">http://letmegooglethatforyou.com</a><br>  UGH!!

There are those that do not get any symptoms when taking them.|`|fHgbL046aa	A lot of people get sick and have headaches while taking prenatal vitamins. You should talk to your doctor. I've heard of people taking 2 Flinstone vitamins. <br>  I buy mine at Wal-mart and its a no-name product which is about $10.00. It has the same ingredients as the expensive brand. I don't think its a good idea not to ever take prenatal vitamins you need to find the one that works for you.<br>  Good Luck|`|98WKYtfwaa	I haven't had this but i know it's common for prenatals to make you sick, constipated or get headaches. <br>  <br>  Try changing prenatal, i take pregnacare, i think it's really good didn't make me feel sick at all. If no other brand works then take flintstone chewable vitamins, just make sure they don't have vitamin a.|`|ItklBKylaa	I never had morning sickness until I started my prenatals! I was sick all day and had horrible headaches! I found out I was allergic to zinc! Which is in almost all prenatals. So you may be having a reaction to something in them. Switch brands or ask your doctor if he, or she, has any other suggestions.|`|BdE4GquHaa	hey! i had very very bad migranes at the start of my pregnancy but it was due to hormones and not my prenatals! i went to the doctor and they only thing you can take is paracetamol or tylenol. Not sure what they would advise though if its the vitamins causing the problems, maybe go to the doctors and tell them, they may suggest a different kind! Worth a try. Good Luck x|`|U5TDVhBFaa	I have heard of people having nausea/headaches from prenatals- most likely due to the artificial chemicals,coloring,filler cr@p. try using organic prenatals-you can buy them at Whole foods|`|ee12f86390071e6ed1ca21eb76bf203faa	my mam does
wXh4QpaYaa	This is extremely upsetting (and that's putting it mildly.) But I would like to know why the heck the mother allowed him to take her riding in an ICE CREAM TRUCK? I know it's a stereotype, but that has rapist written all over it.|`|wZAeBisbaa	How would I feel?  I'd be extremely angry at what this man did and at the law enforcement system that allowed him to escape.  If it were my town, I would hope that citizens would organize to search for him and to protect anyone (kids or adults) who might be alone or vulnerable.  I'm not suggesting any kind of vigilante, take-the-law-into-your-own-hands response, just that the citizens may have to do what the police department couldn't - watch for this guy.  And really, the safest places are those where neighbors watch out for each other.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this happens every day in the US.  think about all the molesters and rapists living in your neighborhood without a criminal history!!|`|28QPS6V9aa	That upsets me! I want to know how he could just casually get up and leave and not have a flock of police officers tackling him. Seems a little fishy to me!|`|TIVrZ2I8aa	WOW!   Speechless....<br>  <br>  1.)  I'm not really all that surprised that someone got away.  I think, officers become so comfortable with their wards that they take for granted that THEY ARE CRIMINALS.<br>  <br>  2.) Sick Motha - Should be chemically castrated as he is Obviously a repeat offender and the "system" hasn't rehabilitated him.  Should have been beaten down by the children's' family while they were calling the police about the incidents!<br>  <br>  I strongly believe that physical punishment is a good deterrent for bad/illegal behavior.  Don't the victims have rights greater than the pieces of scum that prey on the helpless?  I say, they lost their rights when the commited the crime!! <br>  <br>  Hope they find that scum and give him what he deserves!!|`|rBq189W1aa	"How would you feel."<br>  <br>  What's the matter, can't think of any productive questions to ask? I mean, it's an appalling situation that this guy wasn't being watched closely enough and was able to escape custody, but what do you want us to do about it?

I've been crying since Thursday night too and I've just kinda lost my appetite. I guess crying and being sad will do that to you. <br>  <br>  Just try to eat something now and maybe take a nap...that should help the shaking.
a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Oh, I agree, it's just one of those things.<br>  <br>  Many people think it's perfectly okay to give unsolicited advice to parents.  It is doubly annoying when they don't have kids themselves.  I don't care how long you've worked with kids, or babysat or had younger siblings, you don't know what it's like to be a parent until you are one.<br>  <br>  So, here's my advice as a parent, to someone who is not yet a parent.<br>  <br>  Before you have kids, practice this exercise while looking in the mirror.  <br>  <br>  Smile.<br>  <br>  Nod politely.<br>  <br>  And say "Thank you for your advice."|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	When you become a parent, one of the first things you learn is that not everyones advice is good advice. You gotta choose what you wanna listen to and disregard the rest.|`|AA11296044	I have become immune t people telling me how to raise my children.<br>  <br>  I did lots of things differently, I breast fed until they were two, I never fed them baby cereal, I put them in pre school when they were 2 1/2, they don't eat meat, we don't own a TV,  I leave them with babysitters from time to time, I have on more than one occasion bribed them to be good,  I make them save some of their allowance, they are not allowed play dates on weeknight, they are identical  twins and i refuse to dress them the same or along a theme and always have.<br>  <br>  Each one is open to criticism.   However, in the end they are my children and I will do as I please.  It is not worth the battle to inform others that they do not know what is best for my kids, I simply nod and smile, occasionally thanking them for the suggestion.|`|jLYTKr33aa	I'm with your dad.  I was an older sister, cousin, and aunt to a total of 11 before I became a mom.  Having one of your own is an entirely new ball game.  I don't like unsolicited advice from anyone, but I will admit that having a childless busybody stick his or her nose in my parenting business is especially irksome.  That is in part because the ones who have never actually been through it tend to be the most critical and judgmental.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I try to (but sometimes fail due to bad moods) offer advice without patronising. Like my avatar says, I'm not a Supermum and I will intentionally tell people I am not perfect - mostly because it makes me more approachable to new parents and mostly because I'm really not perfect!<br>  I wouldn't take parenting advice from someone who wasn't a parent, nor would I offer it to someone on something I'm not experienced in. My sister is the prime example, she is single and childless yet often dismisses my concerns with breastfeeding because to her, it's not so important, and she said that my rewards system at home for my 3 year old was simply 'bribery' (although I tried everything else and this is the only thing that has worked for her - but I absolutely do not think its bribery). <br>  I'v learned to just say, 'hmm... ok', and leave it there. A first time mother thinks they know it all when their child has grown, a mother of more knows that every child is different and so must your approach be.<br>  No-one has all the answers, we're all learning every day.|`|rBq189W1aa	I've never had anybody try to tell me how to raise my kids. Probably because I'm not American. Damn, y'all are rude!|`|J6DmEUTeaa	I have a daughter and hate ppls advice or interfering even if they do think they are doing the right thing.If i wanted advice i would ask. People should keep there noses out. Everyone has different parenting skills and no one is the perfect parent but each parent learns themselves how to bring up their child. I have had a lot of times where people have tried to tell me how to do something with my daughter and all this did was annoy the hell out of me. People need to step back and allow parents to be parents.|`|faLD7RiVaa	I find it infuriating when anyone, non-parent, newbie, old-timer, etc, portrays themselves as Super-parent who can do no wrong and has all the answers. <br>  I welcome others opinions and thoughts on parenting, especially since nearly 13 years later I am still waiting on my parenting manual (must have really gotten lost in the mail) but I detest those who tell you exactly how you should be raising your child an insinuate that any other way is wrong. Frankly, I know I speak for all parents on this one whether they like it or not, we don't always know what we are doing and help is always welcome, even if we do not show it being welcome BUT again, Super-Parents, take the cape off and keep your opinion to yourself if you can not offer it in a productive fashion.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	The only thing that ever really bugs me is when people (namely, my inlaws) try to give me "advice" that is seriously outdated. Or when my FIL tried to tell me to give my child Benadryl to drug him at night to sleep. And he was a freaking doctor! *sigh* A lot of times because of his medical profession he would think he would know a lot and give advice that really didn't sit well with me - he was already retired by that point and things had changed a lot. <br>  <br>  It sounds like your dad is pretty in touch with things and remembers what it was like to have you kids. Sometimes I think people go into a fog after having raised children and forget what it's like. It's nice that he still remembers and sounds like if/when you do have our own kids, he won't be a meddlesome grandparent, which is always a plus! :D
24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	My little guy did that, and I hear you it is annoying.  What I did was I took him away from the breast, he cried a little, so then I put him back and he got serious and started eating.  He doesn't do that much anymore (6 weeks) unless he is not really hungry.  <br>  <br>  I took him away from the breast to see if he was really hungry or not.  If he was not really hungry, then he didn't care, if he was then he cried.  I would tell him that he needed to eat and not play.|`|2EzXGFOQaa	hi this is totally normal. my son done the exact same his feeds only lasted 10 mins, try putting your brest milk into a bottle so some1 else can feed her while you get a little sleep. its also cause her tummy is really tiny and cant hold much, as she gets older she'll drink more.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|1hciyvKdaa	During the next 3 months, dont make plans on doing anything but what baby needs and it will be less frustrating. Babies muscles have never been used before birht. It might be baby has dislatched a little and wants to be put back on firm again? Babies usually stop when they are not getting enough or need a breath or two. So most likely baby is playing around and is not latched on as good as when first put on. My daughter was given these plastic sheild thingys for nipple protection, and they made feeding more successful too. They gave them to her at the hospital by the breatfeeding tech. Maybe go get some of those to help. My kids all fussed, once I didnt plan on anything but feeding them, I mean doing nothing else, it wasnt as stressfull anymore

ItklBKylaa	I was almost 2 months pregnant before the test even register as positive. I had alot of cramping and bloating in the first trimester so I just pasted it off as a last or missed period. If you really want to know wait a week if you don't get your period go to the doctor! It takes like 5 minutes and they know.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	I would say you are probably not pregnant, but sometimes ovulation is not always right on and you could have ovulated later.  Take another test in a few days.|`|BsaJoP3aaa	I would email a doctor  and could  you help me with my problem I13 and I pregnant.|`|nIE5Qtiqaa	First of all, do not depend on ovulation calenders as birth control. That is for couples who are trying to have a baby, not prevent one.And, if you got pregnant that early, you won't notice any symptoms. I didn't find out until six weeks and I never suspected it, I went to the doctor for something else and I'm just now starting to have symptoms at 13 weeks. And your just wasting money if you take a preg test before you miss your period. Wait until after, then pee on a stick.|`|WOhKrOJ4aa	sounds like your periods on the way|`|256cVXsmaa	to long to read, if you shortened it down you would probably get alot more answers.  Take a test 3 days after you miss your period for accuracy.  Sometimes your hormones are still to low to detect on the test.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Your ovaries can't read a calendar.  Wait a week before you take another test.
C55pji5Qaa	It is possible but not common! I had massive bloating up until 9 weeks and then I had a teeny tiny bump.I still look smaller then women carrying one baby.Whereas,my best friend had one baby and was very large.Every mother carries differently. I had two first trimester ultrasounds and both times each baby was very obvious.I guess if they were identical and in the same sac it would be easy to "hide" at 6 weeks but once again that is not common.So their could be 2,you will have to wait on the next ultrasound but do not go by your size or symptoms.Good luck!|`|ALX19Md4aa	OH YEAH it's possible!!!!! My sister in law was about 13 weeks had 3 ultrasounds and then next one she had they were like "WAIT there are two in there!!" they missed it in past ultrasounds because they babies heart beats were so close to each other kinda sounded like the same. So to make a long story short. She just has twin girls on march 5th!<br>  <br>  So it's very possible|`|BdE4GquHaa	yep i agree with army wife, they hide behind eachother all the time, lots of women dont find out they are carrying twins until there 12 week scan or even later! x|`|Ex3XC0ayaa	Yes it's very possible that the tech could have missed a second heart beat.My Doc did.Congrats and good luck...|`|vKEYa8aeaa	yes its possible! my u/s tech told me that sometimes twins will "hide" one behind the other lol<br>  <br>  congrats!!
72Fjnwz9aa	Are you sure it is discharge? I could be incontinence which is common with pregnancy and can last long after...if you had her 7 months ago it should have nothing o do with that..but you might want a doc check you for urine leakage. Is it possible you are preggo again?|`|HPRlEWu1aa	is it just like increased dischage?<br>  <br>  it could be from your pregnancy .. did ur doc check the discharge? make sure its nothing bacterial?  .. i ha increased disharge with no odor and my doc put me on some decs i had to take 3 times a day for 5 days and it went away .. i cant remember what it was called tho.
LPsogWKSaa	Hi there, where I live (UK) it is recommended that a newborn baby lies completely flat in a pram until at least 3 months to let their little spines develop correctly so I presume that is what your MIL is talking about. I wondered about this too because you see babies in car seats that attach to prams and they are obv not lie flat, but my midwife told me that the baby should only be in them for max 2 hours but that is the best position for them to be in if there was an impact.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and have fun choosing your pram x|`|5ujzs0k3aa	I am from thee U.S. I am guessing by pram you mean stroller? Or buggie? The ones that look old fashioned? Some are flat, but most of them have padding inside to keep baby's head a little elevated. It is more comfortable for baby not to be lying flat on the back while in motion because then baby's milk kind of sloshes around in the tummy when you like stop and go.  Keeping baby a little upright helps prevent spitting up and most baby's enjoy sleeping upright a little anyways.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	as long as the baby is leaned back enough that his or her neck is supported and not flopping to the sides and everywhere, or there is a pad that keeps their head in place the pram doesnt have to be totally flat. most everyone here in america uses strollers paired with the carseat instead of a pram, and the carseats dont allow the baby to be fully laid down at all.<br>  <br>  here is what i mean by the pads - - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&search-alias=baby-products&field-keywords=infant%20head%20positioner&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&search-a...</a><br>  <br>  there are several different kids you can put in a pram/stroller/push chair|`|1hciyvKdaa	Newborns should have a flat one, they have no muscle tone yet to hold them up, or keep them from falling over. Newborns should also sleep in their cribs, instead of swings as many moms do these days. Until manufactured furniture came along, all babies slept flat or were carried by mom right??? Its not fashion its nature. You can use what you have if need be since if its been purchased already too. Just watch baby doesn't tip to the side into a blanket. The flat one will encourage sleeping in a crib better that's for sure.
FyN7U0p9aa	My question is how much money should I give the priest for his gift ? <br>  <br>  I would give him $500 at each ceremony he performs for you.<br>  Plus a gift he would like and could use.<br>  <br>  Also do people have baptism a party after the baptism ? <br>  <br>  Yes<br>  <br>  Do I buy her a cake ? <br>  <br>  That would be great.<br>  <br>  A religious present ?<br>  <br>  A Bible that is engraved on the front with her name and the date of Baptism.<br>  <br>  Lots of hugs to you sounds like good things are happening in your family.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	That's nice! And she's old enough to understand and make the decision for herself, which is a good thing. Most ministers will tell you, at least ours did, to give what we felt comfortable giving. So there's no real set fee, unless they charge one. You could call the church and ask ahead of time, just in case. You can celebrate the two ceremonies afterwards by having family and friends for potluck and cake or just light refreshments; that's what we did with both of our kids. We had refreshments afterwards in the church basement and it was a very nice time to get together with people we hadn't seen in awhile.|`|3wbRJ5sBaa	ill be baptizing my son next week as well. I never thought of getting the pastor a gift tho. I just plan on inviting him to the after party. Nothing big, just some eats and drinks but NO alcohol! Im getting a cake also but he's a baby so he doesnt need a gift. he gets all the stuff he needs =)<br>  <br>  ps. hope i helped!|`|OPjTfhqmaa	you should wait till your daughters older like 14 or 15 to see if she even wants to get baptized. Its something that is done to her and will be with her for the rest of her life. When she gets older she might take her own path and become an atheist. She would say yes right now because its what you want and she doesnt know any better. Just give her a choice.|`|3oSQQt6maa	Wheni baptized my son we had a party, and all the people bought him gifts, i bought the cake, it was a bible and said happy baptism i think, i dont remember. You could buy her a necklace with jesus on the cross.
ACyrJQHOaa	hi,ME!! With my first son, i felt like crap the whole way through but now im carrying my second son and im feeling ALOT better.I get more kicks than i did with my first son and alot more braxton hicks but they are ok.So this is my second pregnancy with another baby boy and i was feeling great until this morning i woke up with a flu.Good luck and congrats on your baby|`|ALX19Md4aa	Well this is my first pregnancy and I'm right now 39 weeks 2 days and I still work a 40 hours a week, still cook and clean the house. I live my life like I wasn't pregnant there are a few times where my body reminds me that I am or he will kick me real good, but I hear you, I feel great!!!|`|nIE5Qtiqaa	Well, Kudos to you because I'm only 13 weeks and I feel like crap. I hope I am as lucky as you as I progress:) You give me hope that things can actually improve!|`|3oSQQt6maa	i felt this way with both pregnancies. Iys just different for everyone.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	The only thing bothering me is my lower back and sometimes my feet...but, I am on them at least 10 hours a day.  Other than that, no problems at all!!!|`|ItklBKylaa	Wel this is my first and other than having contractions for the last week and being on bed rest I feel absolutely great! Which makes sitting here doing nothing very difficult! I'm 32 weeks.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, I've not been as lucky, I think I've been miserable the whole time which keeps making me think my little girl will end up being an only child. It's good to hear your second pregnancy is going much smoother than your first, that gives me hope! :]
aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	Hon, trust your instincts and the signals your body is sending you.  I'd try just relaxing (taking a shower or a bath), watching a funny movie, going for a walk.  If things start to progress or the pain gets any worse, call your doctor.|`|gdCqKl89aa	This is a good thing, except you need to rest more with your legs up! Your body is trying to prepare you for labor, you do NOT want to go early because it makes it longer and harder on you. Your body will know when it is ready...it will be like this, but won't stop. You should not have any blood unless it is in a mucus plug. Have them do an ultrasound to ensure you do not have placental detachment bleeding, that could cause contractions and kill the baby...better safe than sorry. You can go into labor several times over the last 5 weeks, but they will stop when you rest. Rest up, you will need it soon!!! Good luck!|`|FNMMm7Dnaa	start walking ! you might start dialating.

FL67UPPHaa	Eva -- 8/10. Sweet, classic, pretty.<br>  <br>  Lexie -- 7/10. I love it, but only as a nickname. I wouldn't use it as a full name. It's cute when a child is younger but as she grows up she may want to use a more formal full name, like Alexa or Alexandra.<br>  <br>  Layla -- 6/10. Not one of my favourites, but it's cute and feminine. I can only really imagine it on a young child though.<br>  <br>  Madison -- 2/10. It's masculine (names ending in -son mean 'son of'), and it's very trendy. I don't like it at all.<br>  <br>  Olivia -- 3/10.

I always thought this was a male name, and then I found out it was actually a female name in medieval times. So, now I like it.

DkT8znckaa	I'm more of a classical kind of person. I hate how you can't even spell or pronounce modern names. Why can't people just give their kids normal names? Out of the modern names, I like Kia, Lacey, Michael, and Jared. I have a cousin named Sage, and I don't like the name to be honest. What is with people naming their kids after weird colors, days of the week, alcohol, cars, food and medicine? I was just at the hospital the other week and I was talking to the nurse about how fall and winter months made horrible names. By the time I have kids though, all those classical names will seem ancient, so I hope name trends change and people just go back to the basics. The only one of your examples I don't like is Phineas. I have a brother named James, and my middle name is Dorothy-Marie.<br>  <br>  - People would be surprised. I know people with names of every single day of the week. My family knows a girl named Chanda Leer (When you say it together, it's like the light..... people are insane!)|`|38193506d53dade90585f207e6844e75aa	Just so you know many of the modern names you listed have been around for a really long time. Juno has been around since the time of the Greeks (Romans?) because she's a god. Michael is a biblical name, I think, so that's also been around for a long time. Alfredo has also probably been awound for a long time. Same with Jared and a ton of other names on the list.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I've heard of A LOT of strange modern names. I went to an art school and a lot of the kids' parents were 'creative.' Among the strange names were: Sasquatch, Cerra, Indigo, Ardon, Imahni, Juniper, Eleven, Xiola and many, many more that I can't think of.|`|I64JOuMKaa	modern for sure !<br>  <br>  but I dont think anyone would name their kid<br>  october, tuesday, juno < - LOL THE MOVIE !<br>  vernor, alfredo < - fettucini alfredo ? LOL =)<br>  or dragon<br>  <br>  some of those names seem a bit odd to me, naming your kid after days and months and food and animals?<br>  we're not that crazy yet LOL.<br>  <br>  but some of those classical names are modern<br>  well like<br>  christian,  linda, juliet, matthew, john, james, richard<br>  and some of them well like classical is used for like middle names like<br>  anne, marie and laura :)|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I probably like most classic names more, but I LOVE Serena, thats one of my bestfriends names.<br>  <br>  My name is Katy is that modern or classic?<br>  Its probably modern aye, Katherine would be the classic version of it.|`|5QFuenebaa	I actually like both and gave my children a modern first name and a classical middle name so they'd have a choice.|`|HFA05vDuaa	i prefer most of the classical over modern although i LOVE unique names|`|TwXJS1thaa	I like both.

But not really the ones you've listed. <br>  I like them caus they're less common|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I love some of both names. Marie, Molly, Rose, Juliet, Charles and James are all ones that I like. Many of them aren't as common as people think, but then again, some are- aka John, etc.<br>  <br>  Modern- Some of the names people are coming up with these days are so ridiculous.<br>  <br>  I like some names on the modern list, I like Korin spelled that way or as Koren, for a girl.

Tullulah?|`|YkD4Pf2Raa	a mix, really. adelaide is my favourite name (definitely classical!) but i also like saffie (modern).<br>  <br>  i think october is an awful name, and ou'd have to be a complete fool to name your child this. october isn't even nice sounding, like april, may or june.<br>  <br>  :)|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	Classical, I think modern ones sound kind of<br>  weird and silly.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	modern times defintaly
1ezYfkX7aa	Maybe he is to hot....that could be causing him to wake up. Dont know if your open to it but i started my kids on rice cereal at that age and gave them some in the morning and evening and that really helped with their sleeping. I just read in a baby magazine that if you have a fan on in the room ( not faced at the baby ) it really helps babies to sleep....dont know if its true but i am willing to try it out when this baby arrives. Goodluck hun =)|`|AA10976444	GEt a good night routine going...a warm bath, and a rum down with Aveeno lavender lotion is a good start...give him 4-6 oz of formula.  Should work like a charm.  At 4 months you can start with a tablespoon of rice cereal before bed.|`|MtOSX19Haa	He could also be getting ready to start teething and his gums hurt.  Run your finger along his gums.  If you feel something hard under the skin, you could give him some teething medicine.  The rice cereal in the bottle worked really well for my son.  He would wake up like that because he was not getting satisfied on just the formula alone.  We started him on it when he was about 2 months old and he never had any problems sleeping after that.|`|iEsICA3Maa	Relax. My baby cousin is 10 months old, and she wakes up every 3 to 4 hours at night. Her naps only last about an hour, and she's perfectly healthy. She's a little fussy after she wakes up, but it's gone in about 20 minutes.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this is normal -try feeding him, changing the diaper, and never turning on the light.  provide a pacifier and let him learn to self soothe.  use a sound soother while he sleeps.|`|bhshBoG5aa	baby are like that just give him a bath at night before going to sleep and he'll do great!
LVZdzPmpaa	Parental consent? From whom: you as the parent or from your parent because you are a minor? <br>  <br>  You do not need the consent of the father to have an abortion. <br>  <br>  If you are a minor, you need the consent of your parent or guardian to have the procedure.<br>  <br>  During an abortion, the patient is conscious, yes. If you are planning to have an abortion, the personnel at the clinic can fill you in on all the details and put your mind at rest. They can also clue you in as to where babies come from and how to avoid future unwanted pregnancies, so take advantage of that service as well.|`|256cVXsmaa	Just to warn you you are going to get some very opinionated comments with this question.  Anyways my friend got one done in the past and she regrets it like none other.  To answer your question though you are not put to sleep at all.  They give you some pain meds that probably won't work to well.  You feel everything, according to my friend it was the most  painful thing she ever went through.  She went to planned parenthood and she didn't need a parental consent.|`|gAPwYArkaa	I depends where you go, if you are a minor some places will do the procedure and you can leave, no questions asked, others you need parental consent (usualy just one parent) and yes, you are awake during the procedure but it doesnt hurt, they will explain the entire procedure before hand.|`|BdE4GquHaa	you do not need parental consent its all confidential. what procedure depend on how far along you are, if your under 9 weeks they can just give you 2 pills to take and its starts you bleeding like a period, you'll get very bad cramps and baby will pass through a bit like a clot (dont hurt and you may not even notice it). If your further than 9 weeks you will need to have a surgical procedure and being awake will depend on which one!! You can ask them to put you to sleep though and im sure they will! good luck x|`|KGppArcfaa	Just one if you are underage, although most places aren't worried about consent.<br>  Yes you are fully awake, and you feel everything. Its horrible.<br>  <br>  I read your other questions, I'm sorry for the situation your in ((hugs))<br>  <br>  I must disagree with the person who says it doesnt hurt...it does hurt.<br>  <br>  I dont want to post any details here, your welcome to msg me through my profile on answers if you have more questions|`|AA10976444	It depends on how far along you are...in the early stages, you can just take medicine to abort the fetus...You shouldn't need any parental consent at planned parenthood.|`|fwro8soqaa	You only need one.  And yes, you will be awake. You will be given a local anesthetic though.  Depending on the clinic, you might be offered a sedative, which will help to relax you.  Remember there is also the abortion pill, which some women prefer, because it does not require an intrusive medical procedure.  Regardless of your decision, make sure you have a counselor available to you for before and after your abortion, and get it done at a time where you will be able to rest for a couple days if you need to. Good luck.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Some states don't require you to have parental consent at all... I live in Florida and we dont' require you to tell your parents here. <br>  <br>  And you're not "fully" awake... you're not put completely under, but you definitely aren't totally alert... and you can't drive yourself home afterwards, that's for sure.|`|LzJJn1m7aa	you should need parental consent shame on you for getting pregnant and wanting to keep it from your parents.

As far as I am aware there are different ways that it can be done i.e. under local but I think if you have local there is a chance that they will keep you in but if you don't have anything then you will be able to leave shortly after. Good Luck|`|72Fjnwz9aa	No you usually do not need parental consent. You can choose to do the proceedure asleep or awake...www.ppww.org this may help answer your questions.|`|r5VFLa84aa	Yes and you are fully awake because the docto makes little girls perform the procedure themselves!
pzLDXL6gaa	It's called RU486, not available everywhere though. I think it's a couple of hundred dollars. Parental consent depends on where you live, in most states you would (same as surgical abortion). Your best bet is to call a clinic and ask or google abortion clinics + your location.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|vKEYa8aeaa	the pill is called RU487, it is illegal in most states though. for all types of abortion it depends on what state you live in whether you need parental consent or not.<br>  <br>  EDIT: plan b isnt the abortion pill and in every state you have to go to the doctor to get it if your under 18 but you dont need parental consent.|`|tOoJL7sYaa	Abortion anything is wrong no matter what. Dont do it.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	It depends on the state you live in whether you need parental consent or not... <br>  <br>  I'm not sure how much it costs but you take it just like a regular pill and you will begin cramping and start bleeding just like you would with your period only the cramping will be much more severe. <br>  <br>  <br>  And to the person who said it's the Plan B pill, you must not be very smart on this subject since pretty much everyone knows you can only take the Plan B pill within 72 hours of having unprotected sex... the abortion pill is somethign TOTALLY different!<br>  It beats getting a surgical abortion.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	The pill is called Plan B.

xkeSwj3Naa	Tell your parents. Yes, they'll probably kill you.|`|p0prrzf2aa	wow smooth.|`|256cVXsmaa	It's going to be hard but you need to tell your parents.  Although it seems frightening and you think they will never talk to you agian, they will in time.  They love you unconditionally and once they cool down they will try to support you 100%.  Sence you are still so young you really do need help from your parents from here on out so just calmly talk to them about it.  To be honest I didn't even no what sex was when I was 13 so I am sure your parents are going to be very shocked, trust me they will cool down in time though.  You need to start thinking of whether or not you want to do abortion, adoption or keep the baby.  You need to go over all those options with your parents and perhaps the babies father?!  You need to decide quickly because you can only choose abortion if it's early on, usually after 12 weeks you can no longer abort your child.  I would really suggest you look up adoption agencies instead (unless you are totally set on keeping your child).  You could look into open adoption where you would still be able to keep in contact with your child throughout it's like... you'd be able to see pics and send letters or even come and visit depending on what adoptive parents you choose.  First and foremost you need to be mature though and talk to your parents.<br>  I too am a teenager having a child, although I am a bit older than you I can relate with you and understand that you are probably so scared right now.<br>  If you want to email me I could try and help you further.

Abortion is too easy to let you out of it, and I disagree with the process from the start.  You'll never learn from your irresponsibility if you dont go through with the pregnancy.  If you were my daughter; I'd make you carry it, be stared at and ridiculed, and go through the pain of labor.

You can get an abortion, but I am positive that you are too young to do it without the consent of your parents. Telling them will not be easy, but just remember that we all have to do hard things like that every once in a while in our lives and the whole situation will be over soon and life will go on. I really hesitate to recommend abortion because it's clearly a decision you must make with your parents, but I will say that you have your whole life ahead of you. You would need financial help as well as help from relatives to raise this child and you yourself are not even in high school. You still have college to look forward to. <br>  <br>  As an aside: It never ceases to amaze me just how cruel someone can be on the internet. Making a 13 year old girl on the internet feel worse about a decision that she made is really just disgusting.|`|yjNIlKhTaa	I think you should tell your parents if you haven't already. Being young and being pregnant is really hard. And at thirteen you can't do it by yourself. If the father is willing to help and has a job then you can get some sort of support. But as far as how much time taking care of the baby is going to take up and how much money you are going to need for clothes and food and diapers, you're going to need alot of help. Maybe you should think of the best interest of the child. Adoption is the better choice instead of keeping it. It might be something you don't want to think about but you will be giving the baby a loving family and possibly some things that you might not be able to give him/her. But please do talk to your parents first and see if they will help you if you want to keep it. Just make sure that whatever you decide you think of best interest of the child.|`|6QXmeaiJaa	I would suggest that you think about what you want, out of life, in a relationship, if the father would stand by you etc. Just keep in mind that you have to do what is best for you. But there will be things that i don't think you will be entitled to until you are 16 i.e. going on the local council housing list, benefits etc, should you need them. Having a child is a big responsibility, you have to make sure that they have food, nappies, wipes, clothes, bottles and make sure that you wash their clothes etc.  <br>  <br>  I have just had my first child and I'm 23. It is hard work, even though I have a very good, supportive husband and family around me. I have always been an independent person but it has been a shock to me. You will no longer be number one. Good Luck|`|zpx1kqlRaa	first of all what the **** are you doing getting prego at 13.  I am only 14 and i can resist the earge to **** everything i see!  The first thing to do is to tell your parents.  It may seem like i am leading you in the direction of complete trouble but this will help.  Then once you tell them all of the nasty juicy details then you ask them to take you to a clinic.

r7q8LW7Aaa	It partly depends on where you are - I'm in the UK and I know my midwife wouldn't consider an early induction for anything that isn't life threatening (although perhaps 39 weeks would be acceptable).<br>  I get the impression that in America, they are more open to these things though. But I could be wrong, and I am open to correction!<br>  ETA - I wouldn't get your hopes up if your in Scotland. As a fellow Scot I don't know anyone who got induced before 39 weeks unless they had pre-eclampsia! Usually, they will hold out till your due date.<br>  i know that's not what you want to hear, but you don't want your hopes up only to be dissapointed.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	It depends on your doctor.<br>  <br>  I for one know that midwives here in Australia are not very lenient, and will continue to let you progress until you are actually due, and then decide what to do from there.<br>  <br>  With any type of induction comes an increased risk of needing a c-section, so your doctor (if they are any good doctor) should sit down with you, and go through every single pro-and con, before actually inducing you.<br>  <br>  I know the pain is unbearable, I myself had a scary last trimester, but be prepared for the fact that your doctor may not induce you, if yours or the babies life is not at risk.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	mostly it will happen, u can just ask ur doctor. they will prob do it after 37weeks tho

ROJans2Taa	they only recommend an extra 200Cal's anyway, most of the reasons for eating more have to do with you, your baby sucks you dry of everything you have, so in order to maintain some health yourself you need the extra Cal's and nutrients, the only thing that's mainly for the baby's sake is folic acid and a few others. I only gained 19lbs total with my first and she was 7lbs 7ounces she is 7 now and perfectly healthy, best wishes|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Congrats on your pregnancy! Normal weight gain should be between 15-25 pounds and not more than that. It is healthier for the baby , if you are not overweight and putting extra 'stress' on your body. Eat well, a balanced diet, drink plenty of water/liquids, take your maternity vitamins and get enough calcium through supplements and diet. Don't worry, you will be fine, I am sure of it.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Don't worry, every pregnancy is different, some people gain weight like mad and others don't. You probably won't start showing for another few weeks yet. <br>  <br>  Eating habits usually do stay the same, some women just eat a little more due to an increased appetite but it's not the same for everyone, your baby is getting enough nutrition because its taking everything it needs from your body and what you eat, then leaves you with the leftovers, if you weren't eating enough then you would suffer before your baby would. Just make sure you're eating quite decent foods and a range of different things.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	ususlly u dont start gaining weight till ur 3rd trimester .. i still eat the same as well. no more, no less, a lil more healthy. im 16 weeks, and havent gained anything yet, my docs not concerved|`|7UfK1CPZaa	well during pregnancy it's normal to gain 25-35 pounds.maybe you'll eating habits will change later in the stage|`|70OHpjySaa	Don’t worry, if you’re not getting the proper nutrients that your baby needs, you’ll be the first to suffer, not your baby. Like if all your teeth turn yellow, that means that you’re not getting enough calcium so your baby is getting calcium from YOU, your teeth (that you can see) and your bones (that you cannot see).<br>  <br>  You need to eat a little better as far as vitamins and calcium go but not so much as far as calories go, the “I’m eating for two” is just a myth and a lot of women gain weight, simply because after years of dieting and watching their waist line, suddenly they feel that they have the right to eat, and they make up for lost time. Then, after the delivery, they’ll blame the baby for the weight gain! I’m glad you’re not using your pregnancy as an excuse to eat too much.<br>  <br>  Every women is different. I’m always amazed when some High School girls abandon their newborn babies in garbage cans during lunch hours and nobody ever noticed they were pregnant! (a little note here, in case any teenage girls out there with unwanted pregnancy is about to do something stupid…you can go to any hospital, deliver the baby and abandon it there, no questions asked, you don’t even have to give your name… you can also leave a baby at any fire station or police station, it’s the safe-haven law...make sure they know that you left your baby there, I just saw on the news a baby died in the cold outside a fire station).<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant, I was showing the first month and then I used my belly like a table to put my dinner plate on because any table was too far anyway. People looked at me with fear in their eyes like I was going to explode any seconds! You’re on the other end of the spectrum…not showing and not gainging much weight…just make sure you eat healthy and you get all the vitamins and minerals that you need.|`|ALX19Md4aa	I was thinking the same thing when I was 18 weeks. I ate whatever I wanted ( I watched what I ate only because I have IBS) But if I wanted 2 bowels of ice cream I had them. I didn't start showing until later, it's didn't for everyone. You only need about 300 xtra calories to your diet. I'm 39 weeks and I have only gained 21lbs!!! I used to ask the Dr if this was ok. EVERY time he told me was the baby will take what they need. If mom and baby aren't gaining then they worry but as long as baby is gaining there is nothing to worry about. Please don't be afraid to ask your Dr a million questions, I do!!|`|5D4T6h7waa	I honestly think that every pregnant woman is different, experiences different wants and needs, and goes through different hormonal changes. The only person that can really tell you whats best for you and your baby is your obgyn!  I for example, was revolted by most foods, and puked 2-3 times a day!  I had to be on special vitamins and constant watch to make sure i was gaining the weight i needed. I promise your going to get like 5 different answers on what to do, but you are your own person and your going to react to your pregnancy your own way...|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Don't worry! I'm 12 weeks & I havn't gained one pound yet & the doctor said it's okay because the baby is growing properly.. my next appointment is set for when I'm 16 weeks along & he said that even if I still hadn't gained any weight at that point he wouldn't be concerned. <br>  <br>  Your baby will get what it needs from you. A fetus only eats what's equivalent to the size of an apple a day, so as long as you're eating regular meals, the baby is getting taken care of! No worries :) <br>  <br>  You will start gaining weight soon! But don't worry about it just yet =]|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	I am 30 weeks pregnant and have actually lost weight.  I lost it right away in the beginning because I didn't have much of an appetite and got full very fast.  I also started eating a lot better.  I have lost a total of 14 pounds and my dr. has just told me as long as I stay at this weight or gain she's not concerned.  My baby is getting enough nutrition in fact is measuring a little big.  Everyone is different, so unless your doctor says she's concerned, don't worry about it.|`|BdE4GquHaa	no its fine, i didnt gain any weight until i was 25 weeks and didnt start showing until about then either! even if you dont gain weight or even lose it the baby will take what it needs from you so dont worry about baby at all!

I think you're fine, but if you're really worried you need to ask you're doctor about it.|`|fKL9sJGRaa	Your fine, some girls barley show (idk why) but as long as you stay updated with your doctor...eventually you will probably show more and more and you will gain weight.

lnsOJ3GBaa	I would check with your local fire department. It doesn't seem right to me as Boosters are designed for small children and would be uncomfortable for you as you're legs are too long from hip to knee. In our area it's 80 pounds or 4'9" tall. Even Police Officers make mistakes. <br>  <br>  I would for now sit in the back seat for now. Not in a booster. If your mom wasn't speeding then I doubt you would have been pulled over so if she expects that u will be responsible for a booster seat ticket then you should be sure she understands that you will agree only if you're not pulled over in the first place for something that she has done. Good Luck to you and God Bless|`|b6EyFLgUaa	You didn't say what state you were in but most states the age is 8 years old. So you shouldnt have to sit in one at all.

I would go down to the police station and talk to them Bring this with you as well and show them,|`|NTfIJa7zaa	If I were you I would call your local State Police post and speak with an officer about this. I think you are too tall to sit in a booster. I know the required weight is 80 lbs but the seat belt will not sit right on you if you are in a booster seat which could cause a lot of harm if you were to be involved in a car accident.

4d2386a5fbffb3cc37efeaa1e185b0deaa	I don't think that you're pregnant. You should make sure that your period next month comes for sure at the right time. YOU CAN BLEED THROUGH YOUR PREGNANCY so there is a possibility that you are in fact pregnant. Consult a doctor if your period doesn't come next month or if you start having morning sickness or any other possible symptoms of pregnancy. Best of luck :)|`|MMmRKxSJaa	sometimes atfer unpro. sex it could mean sperm settled in you if u bleed the next day id get checked to be safe|`|XzLUA7ataa	No, it was not the correct time in your cycle for conception.|`|nIE5Qtiqaa	Red in the underwear means no bun in the oven,  usually. I do know plp who had thiers while pregnant though. I don't think you are. The only for sure way to know is to pee on a stick.The sex probably brought on your period. Your breast pain is probably period related, and that doesn't come until later in the pregnancy anyway, or at least it didn't for me.

tQPvv0Glaa	Since your period is so late and you are experiencing symptoms, you should ask your doctor for a blood pregnancy test.  I am 16 weeks pregnant, and for this pregnancy I have had almost no breast changes - they are not very sensitive or sore and they don't seem to be any larger - so don't let that worry you.  My greatest symptoms so far this pregnancy have been nausea and and extremely heightened sense of smell, like you mentioned.  Ask your doctor for a blood test.  Good luck!|`|YP3rEESUaa	how long are you cycles and when did you take the tests?    if you have a longer than normal cycle and you ovulated late,  that could cause your cycle to be even longer, and that would be the reason for the neg. test results.  <br>  Now if you have a normal cycle and still ovulated late, and you were pregnant then you should be able to get a positive result by now.  <br>  <br>  the best think I can suggest is to test again and if its still negative, talk to you OBGYN about it.  Best of luck to you, and lots of sticky baby dust!!!  =)|`|AA10564328	im sorry but the doctor could be right.whos else opinion do you need when you went to the doctor|`|wWkfASTNaa	It is perfectly normal for people to get negatives and turn out pregnant later, it is usually because they test too early. I dont know what the case is with you though since your LMP was so long ago, I would think that it should be accurate by now. As far as that hip pain, I got something similar when I was getting my period each month, and this month I didnt when I got my BFP. I would see if the doctor can give you a blood test, they are much more accurate. And if it is not normal for you to have such a long cycle, you may need the doc to check on you to see if they can "jump start" your period.
vx4xwsa3aa	girl, it is the implanon!!!! i had the implanon for 10 months also and i gained 45 lbs in that time frame!!!!!!! i got it taken out july 25, and by aug 5 i had lost 20 lbs just like that, i hadnt changed my eating habits or anything, it was like all the water weight just fell off of me... i worked out regularly and still kept gaining weight... my friends all have the same problems as well, though they refuse to get them taken out bc they dont want to get on the pill, lol.... be advised though, you CAN get pregnant as soon as its taken out!!! i found out i was pregnant aug 25... and then had a miscarriage, so be careful!!!!!
