Sbcj1reRaa	Los elfos son criaturas míticas del folclore nórdico, que aparecen con frecuencia en la fantasía medieval<br>  <br>  Los elfos son humanoides de apariencia frágil y delicada, que viven durante cientos de a?os. <br>  <br>  Es algo difícil tratar de explicar, o hablar sobre seres que no son espíritus, ni ángeles, ni humanos, pero, que, sin embargo, tienen algo de todos ellos y mas. Podemos darle el nombre genérico de elementales, espíritus de la naturaleza. Todo ellos habitan el Mágico Mundo de las Hadas<br>  <br>  Son descritos como seres bellos y luminosos, o bien seres semidivinos o mágicos, similares a la imagen literaria de las hadas o las ninfas. De hecho, la palabra "Sol" en nórdico era Alfrothul o Rayo élfico; se decía que por ello era mortal para elfos y enanos. Se habla de dos -incluso tres- grupos (Razas) de elfos:<br>  <br>  Elfos de la luz (Bien): originarios de Alfheim ("Hogar de Elfos"), también llamada Lj?salfheim ("Hogar de la Luz élfica"), que era el reino que regía Freyr y que era uno de los Nueve Mundos -el más alto de ellos- que conectaba el árbol del Mundo Yggdrasil. Muy hermosos y brillantes iban vestidos con telas muy finas y transparentes. Amaban la luz, eran bondadosos con los hombres y generalmente se aparecían bajo la forma de ni?os bellos y amables. <br>  Elfos de la oscuridad (Mal), llamados swartalfr ("elfos oscuros"), tan parecidos a la idea actual de "enano" que muchos textos simplemente los llaman enanos. Vivían "bajo tierra" en Schwarzalbenheim. Eran feos, de nariz larga y de un color moreno descrito como "sucio". Aparecían sólo por la noche, pues huían del sol como de su mayor enemigo, pues si un rayo de luz caía sobre uno de ellos quedaba inmediatamente convertido en piedra. Su lenguaje era el eco de las soledades y vivían en cuevas y grietas. Se creía que habían nacido de las larvas y que después los dioses los dotaron de forma humana y gran sabiduría. Tenían gran conocimiento de los poderes ocultos de la naturaleza y de la escritura rúnica, que grababan y explicaban. Eran hábiles artífices y trabajaban los metales y la madera. Entre sus obras más reconocidas por todos, estaba el martillo de Thor y el barco Skidbladnir, que entregaron a Freyr. Esta nave era tan grande que podía contener a todos los dioses con sus utensilios y armamento, y tan ingeniosamente construida, que podía plegarse y meterse en una bolsa de viaje.Algunas veces no se conoce con exactitud de donde provienen pero es un hecho que forman parte de la cultura universal. <br>  <br>   Los elfos de la fantasía literaria En novelas de fantasía y folclore, los elfos son frecuentemente descritos como gente peque?a con orejas puntiagudas y personalidades traviesas. Además, en la visión más moderna son imperceptibles, y viven en los bosques y otros lugares naturales; así, se los mezcla con duendes y otros seres faéricos tradicionales,<br>  <br>  En su versión literaria moderna, son longevos (pueden vivir milenios) y tienen poderes mágicos, que usan para proteger la naturaleza. Se cuenta que la raza élfica ha precedido a la Humanidad (Tolkien) en un gran número de milenios. Viven en sociedades análogas a las humanas, con reyes a quienes están sometidos. Aman el juego, la danza y el canto. A menudo pasan la noche entera en rondas infatigables que sólo interrumpe el canto del gallo, pues temen la luz del día y la mirada de los humanos. El que, de noche, en una llanura solitaria, se deja fascinar por la belleza de sus hijas y acepta entrar en su ronda, está perdido. Pero lo más frecuente es que sus danzas no tengan testigos; por la ma?ana se nota solamente en la hierba húmeda el rastro de sus pasos.<br>  <br>  En alta fantasía, generalmente los elfos no son hostiles a los humanos, ya que los consideran inferiores y de poca importancia. A menudo desprecian a la especie humana como inferior y bárbara, del mismo modo que algunos miran a los animales de compa?ía y otros animales. También hay elfos oscuros (svartalfer en la mitología nórdica), los cuales son retorcidos y malignos. Los elfos son enemigos de los orcos y goblins, y suelen estar permanentemente peleados con los enanos.|`|42BZjkpWaa	Los elfos son los seres mas Bellos del planeta, son los unicos seres que poseen una piel bella y muy blanca, poseen unas orejas un poco puntiagudas, no son seres guerreros ni luchadores se defienden con Arcos los cuales poseen una carga ilimitada de flechas debido  a su magia... Y lo mejor de todo es que son seres Inmortales... No te pueden hacer nada y no puedes tratar mal a un Elfo debido a que no existen... Ellos son seres mitologicos asi como un unicornio o un hipogrifo... De ahi provienen los Elfos...|`|8ev2Uaisaa	dicen que los elfos son criaturas misticas y peque?as  pero tambien existen los trolls que son criaturas maleficas pero si tienes uno y lo rompes lo llevas al bosque y lo entierras  pero si  quieres que te traigan buena suerte  ponle unos dulces o miel pero algunos te hacen travesuras en la noche|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Duendes|`|WfnMGUneaa	como tipo duendes

0NcRUSCoaa	Lol!  I love the wii.  I bought one for my late fiance for Christmas 2007 and we were addicted to it.  We really had some laughs on it.  I hope they have Wii in heaven for him. :)|`|kthrNyAdaa	see society has kind of a misconception.<br>  <br>  when video games first started building steam nearly 20 years ago, mostly kids were the ones that were playing the games.  well now we have grown up.<br>  <br>  systems like PS3 and even XBox360 are more geared toward the more mature gamers in society.  therefore proving that adults play games.  the Wii actually is designed for the mothers and fathers of the hardcore gamer.  interesting huh...<br>  <br>  in my opinion i have no problem with adult video gamers.  so what if you put the kids to bed early.  you need time for yourself too and you shouldnt feel bad unless its like 5:30 in the afternoon, thats on the excessive side.<br>  <br>  as a side note. many many adults also play World of Warcraft, another things that shows how much adults actually do play video games.<br>  <br>  well i hope all is well, take it easy and happy gaming<br>  <br>  *well i hope you are kidding about sending them to bed at 6pm, unless they are getting up at 4am, that isnt going to work out for very long.|`|VeLhLlulaa	i am also an adult and find games therapeutic, so i play them,  go ahead and enjoy.|`|1lewFV8oaa	I have no problems with adults playing video games.

LOL|`|7aff29b7fbf0ecfdd2147a496ed57e76aa	Always remember... the adults of today, grew up on video games...<br>  <br>  From the 8 bit generation of the Atari 2600 and Colecovision, thru the classics of the 16 bit era, Snes and MD... to todays super consoles... and as adults we have the income to afford them... :)|`|dwEJ94yEaa	No thats not bad especially if the kids are young bcuz they need there sleep.

caLPjFI7aa	cod 4 is way better than cod 5 even though the maps were huge on waw, but they over killed it in this game.  First off how many world war 2 games can you do when enough is enough.  I want new weapons that are real that are used in modern combat rather than weapons like old bolt action rifles or old thompson models that can be put on the shelf.  The tank concept was a bad idea for the whole game since one team rushes to it and massively kills your team. Glitches in the waw were horrible and the camping in waw was worse in there than four.  I know 4's maps like the back of my hand i know where everybody lays or camps out and easy target kills for me.  I dont want someone trying to get out the map or hide under the map or waw and cheap kill.  I had waw and returned it after all the massive camping and just plain out boredom for the series. Mind you i loved cod 3 online play but i will stick to 4.  cod 4 was like getting an awesome surround sound system for your system for your birthday. WAW was like a sweater that was already worn that had cat vomit and hair on it from grandma and was forced to wear because of disownment from family.|`|KUcM5UDKaa	Call of Duty 4 is better than World at War, I think. <br>  <br>  I just like the guns better. The guns are everything. The maps are decent, I have no problems with them. I just want to shoot people with nice guns, and I get to do that in COD 4.|`|c5W2Q6qKaa	4. COD5 was just strange: the levels were rushed and pretty cliched, the multiplayer is dominated by camping nubs, and the storyline was so silly.|`|ExYwvcqvaa	i still think 4 was better because at least you have a chance of winning when you first start off and dont have crappy weapons.  in 4 you could just get easy kills to lvl up and 5 you have to be a high lvl just to get kills.|`|X1k1JRX9aa	cod4 cause theres way better guns and everything cod waw wasnt so hot|`|aXXTHpHBaa	COD4|`|7PNnv8Asaa	COD WAW kicks butt here. cod 4 wasnt nearly as good. the maps werent made decent, and everybody snipes.<br>  in COD WAW, at least they have fixed the maps now, and the sniping is balanced out. also with the addiion of nazi zombies, i would say this is the best.

bU9Iy8Gvaa	If you insist on beating Cletus without a gun, it's a challenge. It can be done, however.<br>  <br>  The small chainsaws that you get after beating Adam the Clown will take his health down pretty quick. You can also carry the books Criminal Biography (that's in the bookstore where Yuu and Shinji are. Back right corner) as well as Entertainment and Engineering (those books are in a bookstore in Paradise Plaza. The one kinda in the center of the plaza), and you'll extend the life of the small chainsaw by 27x.<br>  <br>  Now, Cletus will slam you over the counter if you jump it, so I'd advise not going behind it if you can help it. His shotgun will knock you back some too. Still, if you charge him and slice him with the small chainsaw a handful of times, he'll drop.<br>  <br>  I'd definitely advise bringing several food items as he hits you hard.<br>  <br>  ... All that said, if you'd LIKE a decent gun before you face Cletus, you can check the Al Fresca Plaza, as there's a sub-machine gun in the fountain that's not so hard to get to. There's also one in the Food Court if you climb the ledge frame where the Italian Chef's head is.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

AA10595247	There are several ways to achieve this: on the Simlogical site, there are several mods you can use.<br>  <br>  There are targetable doors which you can put on a sim's room so only that sim will go in an no one else (the assigned sim can give keys to anyone for access if they want).<a href="http://www.simlogical.com/sl/Sims2Pages/Sims2_AccessControl.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.simlogical.com/sl/Sims2Pages/...</a><br>  <br>  Or you can use reservable beds, so you can assign just the bed to a certain sim. Here is the link:<a href="http://www.simlogical.com/sl/Sims2Pages/Sims2_Sleeping.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.simlogical.com/sl/Sims2Pages/...</a> (there are a lot of great mods there, by the way. The creator also puts an icon next to the mod to let you know which mod is compatible with the base game and expansions).<br>  <br>  If you have University and up there is also a mod called 'Smart Beds'. When a sim chooses a bed (or you can direct your sim to the bed you want them to use) you click on the sim and an option called 'bed ownership' shows up. When you click on that, you get several options to choose from.<a href="http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php?topic=15.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php?t...</a>
wpUaxn82aa	Simple Answer: Because you were not the one that bought them.
ZzXxRLWcaa	The PS3...<br>  <br>  reliability alone makes it better (you dont have to send your console back to microsoft ten times a year).<br>  <br>  The online is supposedly better on Xbox, but honestly...the PS3 online does everything I need it to, plus it has "home"... which is neat.<br>  <br>  Slightly more games on Xbox (its been out longer and they spent a ton of bribe money for developers), but many of the games aren't truly next-gen. PS3 games just feel higher tech. I'm ticked there's no mass effect or fable 2 on Ps3, but mass effect 2 will be there. Exclusive console games are a thing of the past really, it behooves developers to make games for multiple platforms... thats more $$ in their pockets. And Ps3 has its own exclusives... Resistance, god of war 3, final fantasy... not too shabby.<br>  <br>  Oh and Blu-ray... its not just about the high def movies (which is cool). But also about the fact the developers can fit huge games on one disc (think metal gear solid 4).. that game on xbox would take like 7 DVDs and arent 1080p compatible.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Xbox is for Halo fanboys, young kids and Microsoft apologists. Real gamers have a PS3. I already have to deal with MS on my PC anyway, thats enough aggravation as is thank you very much.|`|tyRNuhJkaa	The truth is that both consoles are equal in their good points and bad points, both have there weakness foe example ring of death - xbox and code of death - ps3. not many people know of the code of death this code is when the blue ray stops reading disks its no a very common fault but does happen, their was a test done to find out which console was best and they came to the conclusion that both are equal has the ps3 has a good processor where as the xbox has better ram, so at the end of the day both are nearly the same.<br>  <br>  my advice is to go with the console that you friends own and play, or to pick the console that has your favorite games or the best features.<br>  <br>  i have a ps3 and i love it, resistance is very good, however my brother has an xbox and halo is amazing.<br>  <br>  so at the end of the day there is no better console, just two very good consoles with good and bad points<br>  <br>  i wish that they would combine the good points of each to make a super like console<br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|gTDzR23jaa	Have you played on the 360?<br>  It has way better games.  There are no PS3 only games besides God of War.  360 has halo, Gears of War, all the sports games, way more RPS's (like Oblivion and Mass Effect, Don't forget about Fallout 3)<br>  If you haven't bought a 360 yet, and you like Playstation, you will love the 360.  If you already have it then you must be crazy ;)|`|BKzOl4nwaa	PS3 has -<br>  <br>  a blu-ray player<br>  an internet browser<br>  Playstation Home<br>  Better Graphics<br>  Sixaxis <br>  DualShock 3<br>  Better HD graphics<br>  slots for SD card etc|`|ZJOXxB5Kaa	I like ps3 because of the better graphics, better games and the fact that it is very, VERY reliable and will not cook itself.|`|FDt7cC8haa	360 is much better, I have a wii, a ps3, and 2 360s....We had to get another one, the 360s are on all the time, the Wii, sits, the PS3, hasn't been on it about 6 months...why....there are no really good ps3 only games...

2AQEAASEaa	Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band will not work on some versions of the PS2. It is a known problem with PS2 systems that have the model number SCPH-75001. The PS2 website from Sony has a list of software titles that will not work with this model number. Guitar Hero World Tour and Rock Band are not listed, but I had the same trouble you are having with my system. I was given a different system and they worked fine. There are also issues with other model numbers, these issues are not documented by Sony.

2Q2ltt1Saa	Yes, it's true, but it's not what you think.  A day of testing for the 360 in development included turning the console on, timing how long it took to turn on, writing that answer down, turning it off, waiting 30 seconds, and doing it again, for 8 hours and $6/hour.  You're not just sat in a seat, given Halo Wars or Final Fantasy XIII and said "play it 'til you have to go home".<br>  <br>  If you're really interested, find games that are in open beta, join their forums, and contribute on there.  You might make a contact at a game studio that may be able to help if you eventually do more to focus on a gaming career, like learning computer programming languages to help better understand development and coding.  Then pray you'll find a job amongst 10,000 other applicants thinking testing and other video game careers are the same glamourous  "paid to play games" jobs that they aren't.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Being a game tester is a quick and easy way to get a foot into the gaming business. However, it's not fun and games. It's an actual job with tons of responsibility<br>  <br>  Say you get a job with Electronic Arts testing for the new Sims5 game( Hypothetical Situation!!). <br>  <br>  You will be tasked with testing the game as its being made. So you may start off with a basic portion of the game with no textures...making sure it does certain things that the developers want. This stage could last months. Think about it. You'll be playing the same section over and over and over and over again.  Plus you will need to write reports on any bugs, glitches or other information...so you'll need to be very organized and very literate.<br>  <br>  Repeat this process at every stage of the game until it's done. Then do it again once the game gets to Alpha, which is the second stage...then again during Beta, and then again during playable demos for shows like E3, because you don't want to send a game out with glitches during a major show.<br>  <br>  I'm not a game tester, just an IT tech, and sitting in the Pit area where a gameis being made and listening to a song fragment from a particular section of the game over and over for 8 hours a day for 7 days a week for maybe months on end SUCKS!<br>  <br>  Plus, game testers are like Tellers or cashiers in retail....You get paid minimum wage.<br>  <br>  <br>  The other way to test games is really not done any more.  There used to be Market Research centers where you could sign up to provide feedback on products ranging from cell phones to video games to vacuums to coffee makers, etc.  You might get paid anywhere from $25 to $200 or more plus a pizza or other lunch...Like I said though, places like this are rare..|`|SO7zRZK9aa	Not much at all, and it isn't going to be as fun as you think it is. You won't actually be playing the games much, just trying to find bugs and glitches. Probably doing the same things over and over a little different each time trying to see if it messes up. Also, testing is usually done as step to a job in game development, and you'd prob need some sort of experience first, something more than a 14 year old has.|`|BeElA5Vpaa	Testing video game isn't simply just playing it and saying what you thought about it, that's what critics are for, i.e game informer. Video game testing actually involves hours of finding glitches and bugs and writing it down. Also takes note about if there's any imbalance in the game or things they need to add or take out. <br>  <br>  Not trying to sound negative but it's the truth. No company is gonna pay money for some person to have fun with their latest game, anyone can do that.<br>  <br>  If you're serious about being a game tester however, I would recommend that you continue playing video game and start learning how to write properly. Possibly even going into game development.|`|NrYuEuEwaa	Yeah, this is true and every 14yr old boy wants that job but you ll find when you get older so do many many other people and it's very hard to get and the job description goes more into it than playing a game and saying how fun it is, In reality you will probably never be one so look to doing more realistic things toward your future.|`|4TqhDN9Laa	no offence but be a gold farmer-you play a mmo then u sell fully levelled accounts of that game on ebay|`|8ebcf16d5c4bb86d139780748d9e79e2aa	There is no magical game studio that let's you walk in and just start testing games. If you want to test games you'd best go to college, get a degree, and work in quality control running debugging programs in the background as you "play" the game, logging bugs and typos ect...You will be looking at lines of code more than the actual game even then. But unless you are really lucky or know someone, don't count on walking into a job where you sit at home in the nude playing xbox all day and getting a fat check every week..Doesn't happen.|`|a1GjkKlMaa	You pretty much have three routes to take...<br>  <br>  1. You can go to school and specifically major in computer science, apply to a video game company like Electronic Arts and work your way into the testing department.<br>  <br>  2. You can cold call companies to find out from their human resources department if they have a program allowing third-party outsiders to test their video games.  This takes a lot of work and fees are negligible.<br>  <br>  3. There are online sites out there that give you access to databases containing companies and contact info to apply for online game testing positions.  Most of these jobs can be worked from home.  It does, however, take some digging to find the higher paying ones.|`|gOE0HeI1aa	if you live in America you can make money testing video games and I think you are old enough. You basically play a game for a few hours then write a review about it and give it a rating out of 5.

AA10595247	When you download a lot, it usually has a self extracting Sims 2 Package file. Clicking on it should open the Sims 2 Installer. Or you can use the Sims 2 Clean Installer (<a href="http://www.modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Clean_Installer)." rel="nofollow">http://www.modthesims2.com/wiki.php?titl...</a> That program will also automatically extract the lot into your sims 2 folder. It's better because you can actually see what you are extracting and take out anything you don't want. It also lets you know if there is a hack packed with the house (will show up highlighted in red).<br>  <br>  Once it's extracted, it goes to the teleport folder. Once the game is loaded, the lot should automatically move to the lotcatalog folder. You really don't have to do anything extra.|`|tQNPy6d5aa	It should download as an .exe file that you run and then it will be put on the Sims 2 automatically.

(Gmail has 8gb capacity, but only allows up to a 20mb attachment.)<br>  <br>  If the internet connection affects your download, it's going to do the same thing to your gameplay.  If there's a different provider, try that, or wait for better weather if that's the problem... but if it's a permanent thing, you probably won't have much luck.|`|PAhdlQ5eaa	It would be much easier to download them straight from Blizzard.

I try not to make friends on there because im more looking for becoming better at what i do then frienships such as call of duty i dont look for friends i look for someone to get in front of my scope to be taken down. And im not trying to be mean on this but, xbox is not aol you are not chatting with people because of that or trying to start a relationship with someone or becoming a guru or dr phil you are just gaming with people and make a friend here and there because they like your style of gaming.

cMHTVMpMaa	Performing Ultra Combos is for the most part just like performing a standard Special Combo, except you most press all three all punch buttons instead of just one of them. You must also make sure your revenge meter has at least one bar (the red circle meter on the bottom left of the super meter. Luckily, all three punch buttons by default are mapped to your L1 button (Left Bumper for X360 peeps).<br>  So, to do Ryu's Ultra, just do qcf, qcf + L1 and you'll pull it off. Everyone's move list can be found on the pause menu<br>  <br>  Best way to learn how to pull it off is in practice mode, where you can configure you super/revenge meters to always be at full before trying it in the full game.

Assassins Creed is an open world game, free to explore, roam around.<br>  <br>  But Ninja Gaiden Sigma is just like any other action adventure games, you need to play the game in Missions.<br>  <br>  The Graphics, game play, story of NGS is amazing and the game is difficult and really brutal.<br>  <br>  Because the game is difficult, was what made it more fun to play.

I can't think of any other console or PC game right now that can compare to that experience.<br>  <br>  I finished it on the PS3 and just bought a used copy for the 360 so I could finish it there, too!

AA10824139	The background story of Fallout (the first of the series) involves a United States alternate history scenario which diverges from reality following World War II. The federal government organizes the states into 13 commonwealths to promote economic stability, but this only divides the US as they put their own ambitions before those of the nation. Tensions rise over the next century due to an increasing energy crisis caused by the depletion of petroleum reserves, leading to the Resource Wars: a series of events over the next few decades which included a Europe-Middle East war, the disbanding of the United Nations, the US annexation of Canada and a Chinese invasion of Alaska. These eventually cumulated into the 2077 Great War, a cataclysmic nuclear exchange that created the post-apocalyptic setting of Fallout.<br>  <br>  Much earlier in 2054 however, the US government had begun a nationwide project to build fallout shelters known as "Vaults" which would officially house privileged segments of the population within. In reality and unknown to most of their inhabitants, a large number were actually built for human subject research - a concept created by the game developer Timothy Cain and the reasoning of which remains unanswered. Each was built to help test something in some way, ranging from overpopulation to deliberate radiation contamination.<br>  <br>  Each installment of the series takes these facts as the context to the subsequent adventures: much of the landscape the player travels through is scarred with wreckage as well as radiation. These effects are not limited to the environment. Mutant survivors - some of those who survived the attack outside of a Vault - are often physically unrecognizable as human. Perhaps the most well-known aspect of this is that most cows are bicephalic (a running gag throughout the series has normal one-headed cows considered abnormal).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Vaults were officially designed by the government contractor Vault-Tec as public shelters, financed by junk bonds and each able to support up to a thousand people. Each self-sufficient, they could in theory sustain their inhabitants indefinitely. However as mentioned earlier, large numbers were refitted to function as big inescapable social experiments. Seen both in-game and the setting's Bible, these included one with an upper age limit of 15, one with a defective food supply and one whose machinery regularly broke down. Vault supervisors were known as Overseers.|`|cXX8iDDNaa	Only playing Fallout 3<br>  I'll give an educated guess.<br>  <br>  The whole world must have been nuked, otherwise survivors would have just been flown off to other countries.<br>  <br>  Yes, it was a nuke, the game has so many in that it's almost impossible it wasn't<br>  <br>  In a post apocalyptic world with no goverment, the world would go crazy, and people have started getting diseased by the atomic radiation.|`|Ip1vFFtZaa	"world war 3"<br>  USA invaded canada, china invaded alaska and were beaten back but at a heavy cost of US soldiers. then everybody starts nuking everybody else and people pay to live in the vaults where they're safe from radiation. they survive but the people outside have a hard life, fighting and dealing with radiation.<br>  the slavers and raiders have a great time killing and enslaving the poor people that were left out that didn't turn into ghouls. the super-mutants are a result of experiments on humans to make them... well super... eventually the vaults were opened and the people living in them came out... only to find this barren world where they have to fight to live...<br>  that's about it...|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	Well they never go into too much detail about the rest of the world, but its assumed that there was a total nuclear apocalypse... so europe, asia, etc... would be toast too.<br>  <br>  It is based on a war with China. Fallout 3 makes this very clear and even added an expansion pack on PC/Xbox (booo.. im a ps3 owner) showing the "alaskan" incident with the Chinese army. Its not clear who "threw the first punch" however.<br>  <br>  As far as why people are crazy? Well this is years after (200 in Fallout 3) the event and the world is still irradiated. So some people became mutants or ghouls... due to radiation exposure. This made them violent. Others are just survivors... and in any survival situation like that some people are more apt to do whatever is necessary to survive... including raiding, killing, brutality, etc... Thats true IRL as well as in the game.|`|i0J7K5Txaa	A war with China.<br>  <br>  Fallout radiation has pretty much destroyed most of the area your in, which is Washington D.C.<br>  <br>  Everything has a 50's appeal to it, if it isn't melted, burned, or smashed that is.<br>  <br>  In theory if you lack a strong source of government you will have gangs and bandits roaming, people struggling to survive, and bizarre happenings from the radioactive fallout.<br>  <br>  They put all of this to story, I'd suggest trying it out.  I didn't regret the purchase.

2iS8SooIaa	GTA 4 would be the better choice, but it depends on your taste in videogames - sports or shooters? Go to IGN.com to look at reviews for the games you are choosing from and watch videos to see if it is your type of game you want to purchase. My opinion would be for GTA 4, it's an amazing game that you can play for months and months on end and still find new things in the game, plus they have just released an add-on "The Lost and the Damned" which is a new episode allowing for more gameplay, story, weapons, and vehicles. GTA 4 definitely.

If you're kinda low on money, then try runnin' some instances and see how many greens you win, then disenchant them all and use the mats to do the enchants you need. It may take a while, but in the end, it's worth it.<br>  <br>  But you'll have to look up what level items you need to disenchant to find out what mats they give. Try Thottbot.com or Wowhead.com.

On the other hand if you are referring to enemies who have 2000hp, then they will always have more hp than you.  It really depends upon the enemy, some will have barely more then you and others will have 8 times or more than you.<br>  <br>  Bill, that is very nice that you beat this game without a guide but that does not mean you are any better than another...|`|ciG5yrgFaa	one way is the license board, purchasing the HP increase licenses.  it's been a while since i've played, but i just looked through my guide book and for the main characters you're looking at 600 to 800 HP for level 20 anyway, so you're on track, don't worry!<br>  <br>  (edit for bill c: i have it in case i get stuck, got it when i was pretty far into the game though, just wanted to see what i had missed.)|`|SCeQY9ZVaa	other person has the right idea, but there is no reason to use a guide.<br>  <br>  edit for that woman begining with "r" i dont like being nasty, good answer. i have an inflated ego with this game as i was the first to beat this game out of my friends apart from one who used a guide. so im a little bitter about guides.

Square-Enix really cracked down hard on replica makers who were doing Final Fantasy stuff awhile back, so it's hard to find outside of eBay, and those items are just ones that already exist.  They're not in production anymore.  They probably won't be sharpened if you buy on eBay (they'll also be really cheap, low-quality metal).<br>  <br>  You won't find any pre-made that are sharpened... the sharpening process is time-consuming, so most replica-makers don't bother, since people usually only want them for display or cosplay use.<br>  <br>  So yeah, like I said, you'll have to contact a blade maker and have it custom-built.

Go to Meezmaker and click the item you want. Don't press save! Then log in on the other window and again, go to meezmaker and select the other item you want. Now this is the tricky part, you have to press the little square button in the corner at the top, by the minimize button. Drag it to the bigger Meez screen and get both save buttons as close together as possible. Then once it's good enough, press the save buttons as FAST as you can.

ickyq53aaa	Ye, is it a huge money making opportunity.  The game will suck, like all other movie games.|`|hpgXPKIbaa	What exactly would you do in it?  Gaze intently? Look longingly?  Not have sex?|`|hsshCpQTaa	No, that would ruin the twilight experience! Also, that would be the most boring game ever.|`|k1A4NT7naa	No it will not have a game - EVER<br>  <br>  great book and film but would never make a good game|`|QPcsvtWKaa	i dnt think so but i heard there might b a board game soon....|`|a12347e43e597a835bd225a5fb2ea268aa	i hope not

3xXIKcMOaa	I had the exact same problem like, half-an hour ago~<br>  <br>  On vista machines, open your Start menu and go to All Programs > Games > Games Explorer and double click on Spore Creature Creator.<br>  <br>  Works for me.<br>  I had to wait a little bit before it started reading, so don't freak out if your computer goes blank screen for a few moments. c:
ZzXxRLWcaa	They're required for 100% if thats what your aiming for...<br>  <br>  But to advance the story you just need to finish the car and plane school, it doesnt matter what "grades" you get. They're pretty easy and kinda fun, so have at it! You should practice flying anyway... tough at first, but you'll get the hang of it.<br>  <br>  have fun!|`|PZYu8no7aa	yes you need to or you wont get to other missions.
i0J7K5Txaa	Do you have the wireless Microsoft attachment for the 360?<br>  <br>  Also it may not be the router at all, it may be a NAT or DNS error, if your just taking some one elses internet you won't be able to fix it and it's also illegal.|`|z48D2oLoaa	I'm pretty sure it's because you have it hooked up to three computers and the 360, Try having the internet only for the 360 for a while and see if it still disconnects.
iy75lge3aa	dickman|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Magikarp. Even if it didn't know surf but Piplup did, it's still more powerfull at 50 than piplup at 10.|`|nDbD2TINaa	of course Magikarp would win. lvl.50 to lvl.10 is no match... even though magikarp sucks

z48D2oLoaa	I have never played the sims on PS2 but I have played it on computer and Gamecube. When I played it on Gamecube I hated it, so it's probably the same on PS2. I like it on computer so that's what I think. Don't have to take my advice because it was on Gamecube but probably pretty similar.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i have sims 2 open for business for pc and i think it's good - but my computer is way too slow for me to actually play on it proplerly. like for example if i wanted to take the car to work; or my business - it would take like half an hour! you can create your own businesses at home; but i find it really confusing. you can set up businesses elsewhere, but never tried that but it would probably be a good game to buy if you are on it a lot - and are good with reading long instructions; and trying to figure things out :) i just stick with the jobs you get in the paper or on the pc for my sims lol sims 2 pets is a really good game to get; because you can create your own dogs(and train them and feed them and everything). there are so many dogs to choose from. you have big dogs or small dogs. you can create your own cats. you can buy other animals in the furniture or pet icon or something like that :) you buy the cage and just click ''stock cage'' or something :) nightlife is supposed to be good too; my friend next has that. i have hot date but can't get onto that - but that looks really good. i have university too and i go on that at my cousins, and that would be a good game to try out :) hope i helped x|`|NARiXGNDaa	yh i think it is, i wanna get it soon <br>  <br>  xx|`|mw6ooCXnaa	Yes,but the best is Seasons.I really want Seasons!!!<br>  I suggest you take Seasons,but that is my opinion,so,take what you want.You can always go on youtube and see gameplay of Open For Business.But On 20 february(3 days ago) Sims 3 was supposed to be out,but they putted it to go ou tin 4 MONTHS!!!!!THAT stupid Ea.Anyways,if you like jobs and all that,buy Open For Business.<br>  <br>  What you can do:<br>  <br>  Now your Sims can create their own businesses. They can design their own clothing boutique, beauty salon, florist, high-end electronics shop, bustling restaurant chain, or virtually any other type of business. Hire your staff as the business grows and put talented Sims to work making toys, running the register, crafting floral bouquets, giving sales pitches, or manufacturing robots. But watch out for slacker employees and be prepared to fire them on the spot. From clever tinkerer to master craftsman, develop your Sim's talents to best suit your business needs. Will they build a thriving business empire or become eccentric entrepreneurs designing the next big thing? <br>  <br>   *Create Thriving Businesses:<br>  Open up shops selling just about anything from clothing, electronics, and toys to flowers, baked goods, robots and more. Customize any business to your choosing by tailoring the store theme, layout and prices. Hire employees with high sales skills and employ independent managers to run things while your Sim is away. Watch as your business grows from a mom and pop shop into a booming empire. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   *Be The Boss:<br>  Train employees, promote the best, and fire the rest. Cater to different customers including browsers and loyal shoppers. Dress your Sims in outrageous mascot outfits that resemble Knights, Ninjas, Gorillas, and more. Promote your best employees, but beware of slacker workers and be prepared to lay them off without hesitation!<br>  <br>   <br>   *Learn The Tricks Of The Trade:<br>  Customer is king. Develop your Sims' sales skills and determine if your employees should use a hard sell or drop the price to close the deal. Win the Best-of-the-Best Award to establish your Sim's business rep. Will your Sim's business make more money selling low quality products at basement rates or luxurious goods at scale-tipping prices?<br>  <br>   <br>   *Turn Talents Into Cash:<br>  Arrange flowers, make toys, and create robots to catch thieves at home or clean up the shop. Develop master-skilled Sims to make the most prized and expensive goods. Settle for an entry-level crafter and churn out pet bricks or faulty toy robots. Just bring home the bacon any way you can!<br>  <br>   <br>   *More Than 125 New Items:<br>  Stock up on essentials for your Sims' business, including display cases, a beauty salon chair, a toy workbench, a floral station, cash registers, and more. Complete your shop atmosphere with awnings and elevators for easy store navigation, or matching uniforms for all employees. With all the new items, there will never be another dull day building a business!|`|zg25kJefaa	I Have Had Open For Business For Over 2 Years Now And I Love It!<br>  You can open your own businesses, that can be your job even though you would still be un-employed but It is worth every penny.<br>  You also get Tons of new items, make-up and Hair!<br>  You can get new eye-shadow from it and hair, even though some of the hair ranges from a little hair bun to monkey helmets, the monkey helmet also comes in pick, grey black and another -color- -colour-  and you can put the statue of the monkey on your home or lot. You can even dress up as the monkey and stand next to it and welcome your costumers!<br>  <br>  In my opinion it is a good game and worth the money that it costs. It was the game I bought with my Original Sims 2 around 2 years ago. It is  and I will list the things it says on the back here:<br>  <br>  Create Thriving Business, Turn talents into cash, You get a salon chair, Lemonade Stand for anyone to use (Not only children but teens and adults, not toddlers or babies though!!!) The Floral kiosk along with the Robot Making machine and toy making machine (Ranges from building Fire trucks to kites! for your sims to actually use!). And even buy your very own elevator (You can use them in shops!!!!) By the way you can make : Clothes Shops, Hair salons, Toy shops, electronic shops, bakeries (Sell the food your sim makes, Any food at all) and many, many more!<br>  You can do many things you cannot with the original sims 2!

ickyq53aaa	Brain Age 2 is better that Big Brain Academy in my opinion.  BBA seemed like it was for kids.  Brain Age 2 is fun and challenging, and you can really see your improvements.|`|n2udSL3saa	well there always brain train game but i would recommend a game which keeps you active like sudoku or a good card game which ever keeps you thinking a lot|`|hAhEvLvuaa	Pokemon a time-less game of thought and happiness
Ff1ss5lWaa	You specs are great!!! I could run R3 with 512 mb ram lol. Anyway you should try to defragmant your disks, delete programs that you dont need. You should get yourself TuneUp Utillities or UniBlue.That is a good way to enhance your PC. Also download the latest drivers for your graphic card. If this all wont work that reinstall your OS|`|PUWoKAG1aa	check the specs on the box. also you need to allow for any other programs running using memory, shut down any programs that are loaded up on the taskbar that you are not using as they use ram. also check the graphics configuration of your card, it may be set too low.
GLtGTQ8maa	Ok you need to be aware of the engine needles.  You may know this but the big one on top is the high speed.  The small one on the carburetor slide is the low speed.  There is one more needle on the carb and its the throttle stop.  What is happening is when you hit the brakes the carb is closing because the servo is pushing it shut.  You need to adjust the throttle stop to stop the carb from closing.  It should be the smallest of all the screws/needles.  I hope this helps.
sQHfnMEqaa	oh my god, i love that game soo freakin much- it rocks. <br>  <br>  kk comes to the cafe every saturday night at 8 and stays until 12, but im pretty sure that youcan only request songs from 8:30 to 12. not sure, though|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Saturday night at 8:00PM|`|XCHoHCrnaa	Hiya KK Slide appears at 8pm - 12am every Sat x|`|K81H2emuaa	saturday night at 8:00pm talk to him and ask him to play you a song|`|ee7onopXaa	He comes on saturdays at nine.

ZzXxRLWcaa	I've often wondered why White Wolf (creators of the Vampire rpg) didnt get more into video games, specifically MMO's.<br>  <br>  They've made 2 quasi-action/rpg PC games that were so-so, but thats about it.<br>  <br>  I think its jealous guarding of intellectual property, thats the only reason I can think why theyd ignore such a potential cash cow.<br>  <br>  I mean seriously, an online world of darkness MMORPG? They'd make a killing... I'd be totally psyched for a game like that. Its perfectly set up for it too... camarilla vs. sababt.. the different clans....different powers... different items. Its practically begging to be an online game. You could start with New York (my hometown, woo!) and then add cities as you expand... mega cool.|`|2jL5Tw9Waa	I would by that game!|`|0156ffd07207f863c560ae37da4a121eaa	that would be very awesome. Get working on it right now...... Well what are you waiting for?
9fa961b127e99b8a3d9cd71c67a70e17aa	short detail:Pokemon platinum! <br>  kingdom hearts is cool but... It can never ever ever beat the intensity of having pokemon like giratina and shaymin to go up againest other players and pokemon and wiping the floor with them! <br>  <br>  i would get it! its alot like pokemon diamond so if you like it...<br>  BUY IT<br>  LONG DETAIL:<br>  If you where a big fan of the poke'mon series this is a great game to add to the collection. They have made a decent amount of improvements from diamond and pearl including graphics and general storyline (even though its still the same evil team plot) as some people who have fallowed this game know, a few poke'mon have some different forms. To name these are rotom, shaymin and gyrintina. (last ones miss spelled I know) The dex has changed as well, normal pokemon like electrovire and magnazone who where only avaible after you got your national dex are now avaible without it. There has also been changes to the world wide trading center and to the battle tower zone.<br>  <br>  kingdom hearts: <br>  Kingdom Hearts: Re Chain of Memories is a deep story that takes off after the original Kingdom Hearts. I think that the viewer will be instantly drawn into its climactic tale...however they may be slightly confused if they aren't already familiar with the first Kingdom Hearts game...or even Kingdom Hearts II. Besides its powerful story line, Kingdom Hearts: Re Chain of Memories has beautiful graphics and excellent gameplay. This game is also not just one of those games that you play for a couple hours and be done with it...you'll be likely to clock in at least 60 hours...and still have objectives you can do, which I think is a plus. This game is a must for those that already own, or are contemplating whether or not to play Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. Sadly if you are buying this PS2 game and only have a PS3, you should probably save your money because I heard there is a glitch that only occurs if you play this game in a PS3 system...otherwise great product.|`|QriWp4fzaa	i myself LOVEEEEE kingdom hearts. i only have the second one but im the best in the world lol. pokemon is fun but the platinum version... idk... kh is the best. i pla both but kh better. which kingdom hrts u getting? theres like one called 356/2 or sumthin like that... they making kingdom hearts 3 soon. id wate for that. check the trailer of kingdom hearts 3 and platinum. im sure then ull think that this is a stupid question=P kh ftw|`|dwEJ94yEaa	Please email me which new kingdom hearts game you are talkin about cuz i have not heard of it. Im thornsnyder@yahoo.com|`|nT5kc4Qiaa	Re: Chain of Memories is pretty fun and you get to play as riku for the first time in the series in the original(not including AR codes). Pokemon platinum sounds like its good, but i think you might have whats known as "buyers remorse" if u buy the kingdom hearts game and end up being dis satisfied with it.|`|0ulJNZFGaa	Platinum its like diamond and pearl except i think the legendary is giratina instead of palkia or dialga<br>  maybe you can get all three who knows?<br>  newest kingdom hearts game FOR PS2 came out at 12/2/08<br>  its called Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories<br>  its like the gameboy version except everything is 3d and there are several new stuff in it like new cards, fight zexion and a 3rd marluxia fight<br>  ya you play as riku also which is really fun<br>  and whoever said kingdom hearts 3 is coming out soon is wrong<br>  they aint even working on it<br>  working on 358/2 days for DS, birth by sleep for PSP, and Coded for <br>  awesome cell phones( i saw it was actually good!)|`|obCjj9XDaa	platinum definitely!!! its going to be the best game yet and its so addicting!! its going to be awesome cant wait. and im 18. lol
speJXeIhaa	I always used my woodcutting as an easy way to make money.I found it was easier to cut yew logs rather than magic,get more - therefore you sell more.|`|mkyXGgGxaa	not sure|`|S2gb1tpBaa	i dont know about wood cutting but i wouldalways mine soome gold in the caves that goes from like lumbriddge to south falador and mine gold and after lvl 60 mining you can go i to the mining guild to mine more gold and mtihril etc and i would make maybe 50g per gold ore.
MnEHO9u9aa	no. you have to add someones friend code|`|Wzws8v8daa	you need to enter their friend code, so you can meet them online or somewhere and exchange friend codes|`|siHke5WPaa	No, you have to exchange friend codes with others to get out and visit. <br>  <br>  Here's my friend code: 2321-0398-5490 and my name is Dee in DeeVille.

jK7pklCKaa	to me CoD 1,2,3 and WaW all look the same. modern warfare is the only one which is remotely different as its set in modern day times. I personally think infinity ward are much better than treyarch, they took the stale CoD franchise and made it original and fresh again and the multiplayer is one of the best out there. Treyarch tried to copy a lot of the stuff that made modern warfare good and released world at war which was pretty medico and went back to WW2.

kthrNyAdaa	well to me there are a couple of reason.<br>  <br>  first off, i usually play with my fiancee.  we are both big fans of RPGs and this gives us an excuse to play one for hours upon hours lol.<br>  <br>  another thing that gets me addicted to it is the sense of accomplishment.  as a gamer my goal is to always get to the top level of that game and to do all that it has to be done.  i guess its just my feeling of getting my monies worth.<br>  <br>  i like being able to do my professions, and play around with the auctions to see how much gold i can make from them.<br>  <br>  now they have the acheivement system so that adds another element to an already massive game.<br>  <br>  the grinding at times does suck, that is why i do other things like battlegrounds, or instances.<br>  <br>  i also forgot to mention that i do enjoy the story behind the game so is nice playing with different characters to get a different perspective on events before and during the game.|`|NRhrO833aa	The Gear and PvP usually keeps me going.|`|1rGntizRaa	well for me i would say the gear. also the powers you can get if you gain exp.. i would also say the missions because they always keep ME going. I hope this helped you!|`|TRaXz61baa	I would say the people I raid with, they make me laugh and some have become very close to me.

HMjKN7UAaa	They had picked up the rights to do it a long while ago, but it was reported back in November that they had given the rights back to NBC Universal and weren't making the game.<br>  <br>  It might have had something to do with the drop in quality/ratings during the second season.
hXOqWnkJaa	Halo 3 is mostly multiplayer and I agree the campaign was horrible.|`|FPsMtmThaa	That's what hype does to a game.  I had the same kind of reaction.  Had similar reaction to Gears 2.  I hear ya man.  It's still a great game and one of those games I always seem to put back in my 360 every once in a while to get that "Halo fix" but for the most part.. Halo fans expected more.  Probably too much so that no matter what Bungie did, it wasn't going to be enough for some.<br>  <br>  Keep it for multiplayer. It gets better.|`|SjGpbohiaa	Halo three is awesome.

AA11850311	There are no sites other than sims2.ea.com that has all the content in Sims2Pack files. Sites with user created content have .zip or .rar files.  Perhaps if you explained why you can't use .zip files or your Downloads folder, I could try and help you with that problem.<br>  <br>  [EDIT] Thanks Sims2Player!  As soon as I realize that a custom content site is a paysite, I stop looking at.  Why pay for custom content, when there is so much good, free content out there?  I think the asker does have some other issue if she can't use her Downloads folder.|`|TXkR9B1Jaa	I agree that sadly there are not many sites that offer packaged files. If you need help learning how to download and want to talk on YIM feel free to send me a message and I can explain it step by step for you. manta.panda is my screen name|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Yep, Melethana is right, except The Sims Resource does actually offer some things in a Sims2Pack folder as well.  I know they didn't use to offer anything that way, but I kept reading that on this site so I finally went to the site to check it out for myself and discovered that yes, they do actually offer quite a bit of things that way.  Not just sims or lots either, but furniture, plumbing, lighting, etc. in a sims2pack folder.  I was actually pretty surprised to find that out. Of course, if you don't pay to be a member, then there's not much you can actually get anyway and even less of the meshes that are necessary, so the sites' still a bad site in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Otherwise though, no there are no other sims 2 websites that offer things in that format.  So, you need to learn to work with zipped and rar folders or don't download cc from anywhere other than EA or The Sims Resource I guess.<br>  <br>  Oh, and even Mac computers can use zips and rars, you just need to download a program that is made to open them that is Mac compatible.<br>  <br>  eta -- I know what you mean, Mel.  I hadn't been to TSR in years and back when I first discovered it, everything was in zips or rars.  But I kept seeing posts on this site stating that TSR had stuff in sims2pack files so I finally went back to the site to see what people were talking about.  Still won't get stuff from that site though cause I feel the same way you do, you shouldn't have to pay for cc when so many sites offer great stuff for free.
XX0ac9iRaa	Your question is quite vague so I'm not exactly sure where you are, but I have a general idea. Make sure you've examined the cell phone in the evidence view completely, and have opened it with the button on the side. After that, you can talk to Marshall (the weird cowboy policeman) about Lana. That should move things on.
w3SLNKyKaa	I can answer question 2 for you my fine sir and also questions 4 and 5. <br>  <br>  2: The story carries on from the very end of the 2nd game, Kratos and the titans are at war with the Gods. Its all about war on Olympus. Its still similar to the previous two games. You start out at the bottom and have to work your way through **** loads of gameplay to get to your final goal but theres additions to the game. Better fighting techniques, even more combinations. <br>  4: Its only gonna be a Playstation exclusive which is kind of **** because i used to have a ps2 but now im on the 360 so i dont get to play it lol. <br>  5: There more than likely wont be another after this one but there may be a prequel to it. I dont see how they could carry on the storyline after this game as it is everything they've been building upto!
haJNjTuUaa	I'm not quite sure what you mean by fire code. If you mean by how much you can put on a lot until a fireperson tells you it's too much, than no. I'm almost 100% sure for Sims 2 Deluxe, and quite sure for Sims 1 Deluxe. I always put a lot of stuff on my lots, and i've never reached ay fire code.

MqpAYioQaa	Some Suggestions:<br>  <br>  Maplestory is fun, but can get old quickly.<br>  Runescape is decent if you ask me.<br>  You could always play World of Warcraft.<br>  Adventurers is a fun, turn based rpg.<br>  Dragon Quest is like Adventurers.<br>  <br>  There are many others. Google "Online Rpg" or "MMORPG". <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|6g0pFUaOaa	online games are runescape  knight online and fiesta|`|SjGpbohiaa	Fate is a good RPG for the PC.|`|ZM6ZlKhCaa	Go to www.combatarms.nexon.net its a cool shooting game and its fps u can play with your friends online
0nvXYAZUaa	The sniper in killzone 2 looks brilliant.  It is a variation of another gun in the game, but with a scope attached.  That makes it sound a bit crap, but it looks awesome.  Also, instead of holding your breath by holding a button, you steady your aim buy holding the six axis controller still.<br>  <br>  In multiplayer you can be a sniper.  You have a cloaking ability so that you are nearly invisible, making you very stealthy.|`|OVpwRVrVaa	maybe there has been some talk about being able to use the six-axis controls to snipe but there has been no confirmation from guerrilla games
KUcM5UDKaa	check your cable at the connection to the back of the xbox and check to see if it is on HDTV or if it is on TV. that could be the problem. it needs to be set to match your television. if it is not an HDTV, the picture will not come on if the cable is set to that. other than that, i dont know.
IUpIHFTKaa	I would post your request on craigslist and your local freecycle.com.<br>  <br>  I would also go to your local model railroad shop.  They often have people who are no longer interested in their layouts that want to get rid of them.  For instance, a friend of mine sold his father's set to our local shop as his father had passed away.  They resold the pieces at very cheap prices as they weren't new and weren't compete sets.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SdHqyWKHaa	Suggest you post your request on Craigslist, in the 'wanted' section, both in your local area and in other cities, too if it will let you. Craigslist is always free to use, too. Your local library can probably direct you to area railroad clubs, who would probably be happy to help you get the word out in that community.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	try ebay..
bqpcecWXaa	go here buddy, you will find any kind of game save for all game for the ps3.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ps3.brewology.com/?page=savedgames&l=A&system=ps3" rel="nofollow">http://ps3.brewology.com/?page=savedgame...</a><br>  <br>  but to download some of the games you must register on the site. dont worry its free and easy, just like using myspace. no worrys about spam or viruses. trust me i recommended it to everyone. works just fiune.

And they definitely have their humourous moments too.|`|J1elZSMUaa	If you guys are really into movies, I would reccomend getting one of the scene it games they have out for the 360. They are great fun if your not into intense gaming.|`|UbRtV8QQaa	I do not know if you have online or not but, i would say that you should get some type of racing game, those are always fun, and maybe a tennis game, those are very entertaining.  If you do have online i would check out the xbox live arcade they ahve a lot of little games that you can buy cheap wil microsoft points (there are hundred of arcade games).
dUsnks9Zaa	There is a gold mining spot on the island inside the volcano. Before you get there you need 30gp to sail to it from port sarim. If you have the new Explorer's ring Lv 3, you can mine gold and teleport back to the mainland. At the gold spot, be careful, there are Lv. 21 skeletons who are agressive to players. There is also a bank not far if yuh qo str8 up<br>  <br>  for members if u go to kamjra north-east thre is a BIG gold ore mining spot.there is a peice of gold on the groung the 10 gold rocks!!!|`|wgVr2Yj1aa	mining guild. undesputedly best place.|`|sagRnblNaa	First off i wouldn't mine gold, at your level you should mine coal at the coal trucks in seers because you can store coal in the trucks then after they are full you go next to the bank and there is a truck, take the coal out and bank it. Or mine mith and coal in mining guild and bank in fally bank.<br>  The best pickaxe in the game is rune or infernal adze is the same as rune but requires a quest and mini game in which you need 92 firemaking for, Stealing Creation pickaxes from the stealing creation mini game are good although it crumbles to dust after a certain amount of uses but gives DOUBLE xp. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

tCkcBwgbaa	pretty good 8/10 but you can't use slifer the sky dragon, i suggest take out flame cerberus cause no effect and 2 tributes, 2100 atk only. add dark magic curtain and a DD defender|`|WP1XY5O6aa	Scrap Iron Scarecrow is a great Card, I do know some of your cards are illegal if your going to go to tournaments. ex: Monster reborn, Slifer (though totally kick *** :D) Try more recent monsters that work well together.|`|hwu4ZFLbaa	5 out of 10, <br>  <br>  i can definitely see that this is a composite deck and you only have what you have<br>   <br>  to make it more dangerous make it smaller and faster<br>  <br>  take out the celtic gaurdian, and the headless night<br>  <br>  it's optional to get a rid of flame cereberus "he is one of your strongest cards" and you can also potentially do away with dark magacian girl and time wizard <br>  <br>  ojama trio can also go, tell me what all decks and packs u own so i can make it better<br>  <br>  guessing that you do have a yu-gi starter deck you can consider putting in the man eater bug card, and last will, also stick in a doma the angel of silence and wall of illusion (these are a nice combo) and put dark holes in the deck to quickly clear the field <br>  hane-hane is also a good addition to the deck<br>  <br>  i would suggest getting the card costdown to make tribute summoning easier and try to stack on as many summond skulls as you can take out junk monsters and concentrate on attempting to summon slifer<br>  <br>  overall: 5 out of 10|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Slifer the Sky Dragon = BANNED<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Terrible, there is no strategy here, it's just a bunch of random stuff thrown together.

ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  There are several types of fabric markers, which are permanent when drawn on certain types of fabric. There are a number of brands of fabric markers. I recommend Crayola Fabric Markers which are non-toxic, and because they are less expensive and the overall experience is exactly like coloring with a regular marker. Other popular brands include Jacquard Tee Juice Fabric Markers (great smooth coverage, kind of paint-like) and Marvy DecoFabric Paint Markers (These markers are for older kids and need to be heat set for best results. However, they also will have better opacity and will be good for drawing on light and dark fabrics.)

vtJDHJDYaa	As soon as the battle begins, Xigbar teleports to a balcony where he attempts to snipe Sora. Start running left or right until you're prompted to hit Triangle to use Break. Follow up with a few Warp Snipes to hit Xigbar and cause him to come down and join the battle.<br>  <br>  As far as strategy goes, the best thing I can offer is this: he teleports around a lot. He shoots a lot. He does have to reload, however. Since he's hard to keep up with, run towards him, but be ready to use Guard to reflect his lasers back at him. This will damage him and save you the hassle of losing too much HP. When he's reloading (you'll hear him mention it), run up and start hacking at him.<br>  <br>  He can also change the playing field around a bit. When there's gaps in the floor, it can be hard to reach him. You can't jump over the gaps due to invisible barriers, so do your best to run around and hit him to change the field back to normal. You can actually still use Guard successfully when Xigbar shoots straight down at you during this time.<br>  <br>  When about a third of his HP is gone, he'll shoot out a large pointed projectile ("Take this!"). When it's coming towards you, use the Warp Snipe reaction command continuously to damage him.<br>  <br>  When you've depleted about two thirds of his HP, Xigbar gets nasty ("You're gonna pay!"). At this point, the room turns into a tiny square, and Xigbar will teleport around shooting at you. If you can get running in a circle quickly enough, most of these attacks will miss. Otherwise be prepared to take a lot of damage. Try using Reflect to break out of this evil pattern. Once you've avoided these shots, Xigbar returns to the middle of the platform. Keep running in a circle! If you get caught by the next barrage of lasers, you're as good as dead (unless Donald or Goofy heal you during the onslaught). If, for some reason, you're in Anti-form at this point, you're in luck; this attack will be insanely easy to run from. Don't count on it though.<br>  <br>  Later on in the battle, Xigbar gets faster and releases more of the projectiles. This is more of a chance to let him have it with Warp Snipe... but things can still get hectic. Using forms is risky, since Anti Form will get torn up in a heartbeat if you're unlucky enough to get that. You may, however, get lucky and get Final Form randomly during this battle too. It's a gamble, and it's up to you. Limits work all right as well, but you may want to conserve MP for healing. Xigbar will also start using that insane laser attack with alarming frequency. Try to end the battle quickly before your resources wear thin.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	Before you even consider trying to battle with Xigbar, put Reflega in your shortcut menu and also equip the Second Chance ability. Reflega will help prevent the sniper blue lasers from attacking you and the Second Chance ability will keep 1 HP after your HP bar is fully depleted from an attack.<br>  <br>  Xigbar begins the battle by transporting himself to a different platform. Use the Break/Warp Snipe Reaction Commands to hit the beams back at him, or you can use the Guard ability. Once Xigbar returns to the stage, use the Reflect Element magic spell to return his shots back at him. Take control of the camera and lock onto him so you can keep track of where he teleports.<br>  <br>  Xigbar uses his magic to change the stage's shape. Return his shots with Reflega, then run up to attack him with several phisical combos while he is dazed. Use the Reaction Commands whenever possible, too. With a series of Warp Snipe Reactions, you can knock back his large blue beam attacks. <br>  <br>  Watch for small black portlas to appear; he fires through these to attack from different odd angles. Here you can't knock back the shots at Xigbar, but you can reflect them to prevent damage. Keep moving to avoid his attacks when he teleports directly overhead.<br>  <br>  When the stage shrinks to a small square, Xigbar attacks with extremely quick bursts. Keep moving arond the stage to avoid taking damage, or use Reflega repeatedly to shield against them. When all the kaos ends, shots are fired everywhere from above. Run in small circles around the stage to avoid them.<br>  <br>  For defeating Xigbar in the World That Never Was, you obtain the MAGNET ELEMENT (from Magnera to Magenga) for Sora, an extra ITEM SLOT for Donald, and a +5 HP boost for Goofy. You also receive the SECRET ANSEM'S REPORT 3.|`|kW4LbLMkaa	When he starts that attack, jump over his lasers and make for the corner close to where he started firing. Stick to the edge of the platform, stopping short when he starts firing towards the center of the platform. When he says "Let's see how ya dance!", run in circles halfway between the edge and the center of the platform.

4er9SBgWaa	Deadmines, Wailing Caverns, Blackfathom Depths, Shadowfang Keep, Gnomeragan, Scarlet Monastery.<br>  <br>  <br>   Drops are random so no one instance drops more than any other.  It's done on rolls.  These do decent gear from level 15-30+ ish<br>  <br>  pax.
KgJllC0maa	Leave the game alone for 5 minutes without touching it. Do not close the app either. I recommend sittying at your computer waiting. all of a sudden you will hear fireworks. It will then tell you that if you tao the sky in a rhythm the islanders will dance.
rPAnZmtmaa	what???|`|ol1twU10aa	you don't need action replay for the r4! you just use r4 cheats and they are the same thing ! No diffrence|`|5HjcVkmKaa	Probably not. It depends. If you get lucky, you hit gold! So no troubles. I just manually put hem on my action reaply!

vBid6hbbaa	I don't think that any of the Sims 2 games allows the roaming from house to house.  It is supposed to be a feature in the Sims 3 though.    <br>  <br>  The Sims Stories has a "directed story mode", kinda like a book with a storyline that you walk the characters through.  It is also laptop friendly.  <br>  <br>  hope it helps|`|PFt11Nm4aa	maybe you can go to any apple store if u have a macintosh but for a pc you should just ask it online at e-bay or kijiji. and lol me either i have no idea wat sims stories is!!! but maybe its just items and stuff...|`|tFRQx2QEaa	Only sims 3 will let u but apartment life lets u walk to other rooms at tht lot
Nnm17zqxaa	You cannot do the finishing move when you are a wolf, execept when you defeat a poe to get the poe soul. The reason is, the finishing blow is intended for sword moves. Again, the finishing blow can only be used on poes to get poe souls.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	Sleegy is right, take it from me too, the finishing move is meant for a sword. You can't do the finishing move as a wolf, unless it is on a poe.<br>  Aren't you skilled enough to beat an enemy as a wolf without using a finishing move anyway?

NRhrO833aa	Did you try uninstalling it and reinstalling it? Because if that does not work, you would need a new disk, considering that the core may be too scathed or do you not have the cd key anymore? I would also check my PC's performance and have it upgraded ONLY if a new cd would not work.|`|rqUGVWKYaa	i know exactly what your talking about!!! lol.....this happened to me but i went to the nearest game stop and they cleaned it up and when i got home to play it it didnt freeze at the hourglass.....so you probably just have to clean it

JmgXTP0taa	Wow if I had a PS3 I take your deal lol...to be honest I think this is too big of a bargain...pointing out that each game costs around $50-60...if $300 is all you need and if you dont mind giving away all these games then its a gewd deal...you make it better if you say they are in perfect condition...AND you have a controller??...i just noticed...lol wow this is a very very good deal!...of course someone wouldnt want to cough up $300 on the spot though...but overall, yes this is a gewd price...I would consider that you raise the price since this is alot of games, but like said, if $300 is all you need and you dont mind selling these games, go ahead...<br>  <br>  **Danny**|`|NsTkE83haa	yes, but it is tough to sell large amounts of games in a bundle, just because many people are interested in sports games vs action and shooting. Maybe make two seperate bundles worth 150$ each. just a suggestion.
4f2GaLhpaa	Sorry I don't have any!!<br>  <br>  A really easy way to get them though is to go to the pound boards, lots of times people advertise if they're going to give out a painted pet, you just have to be there to get it. <br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is play Key Quest. The gold keys give you paint brushes, it's all a matter of luck.|`|EzxeHsLHaa	Make neopoints by playing games and buy a paint brush or a morphing potion. Simple as that.|`|1tlZ0Wocaa	go to the neopian boards and go to the topic of the pound.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardlist.phtml?board=34" rel="nofollow">http://www.neopets.com/neoboards/boardli...</a>
6difexIJaa	I've changed named before, but everyone knew who I was.  I changed my shaman from "Shamenator" to "Healubez" then to "Bezzie"<br>  <br>  Everyone called me Bezzie so I changed it.  If you're worried about recognition, just have people start calling you by the new name for a week or so, correct them constantly.  When you do change the name, alert your friends list and guild about who you are now, so the GM can make a note in guild.<br>  <br>  As for the male to female thing, I personally grow to love my characters as I level.  I just accept who they are and what they look like.  Yes I get bored of it, but I just eat a savory deviate delight or drink a nogginfogger and it changes my appearance.<br>  <br>  Don't waste money on model changes when you have the ability to do it already.<br>  <br>  The name can be free, but scary.  Deleted your character, then create a level 1 of the name of the high level you deleted.  Then ticket a GM on the server and ask for it back.  In about 1-2 weeks there's your character back with (dun dundundun!) a name change window.
zt1JeAKpaa	I've had the homebrew channel since it came out, and I've never had problems with my Wii. I would recommend it because it allows you to download Wii shop channel games for free.

NRhrO833aa	Inevitable. The playstation 2 does not support the OS Windows XP or Vista, which is required to play a PC game [and some, MAC]. The closest you will ever get to doing that,  is burning PS2 CDs onto disks [but they have to be ps2 games] and playing them on the PS2, but even with that, you would have to have your ps2 modded. So to answer your question, the answer is no :). I hope this was informative!|`|UcxNeGeKaa	If the computer game has been developed into a PS2 game then yes ;D<br>  Otherwise...no.

The 52-card deck is divided into 4 suits, each with 13 cards:  Ace, King, Queen, Jack (or Knave), and the numbered cards 2 through 10, inclusive.

VZJ8P7e8aa	The best thing to try is probally just restarting the console, t6hen changing the batteries in the controller.<br>  <br>  If your problem continues, maybe read the wii user manual.<br>  Still nothing?<br>  Try contacting the place you baught the wii, and if it can't be repaired. It may be time for a new wii.|`|i210xqkgaa	well some of the wii games have weird controls, maybe your holding the remote wrong? maybe you have to hold it a certain way or hold a certain button down? i'm sorry if this is offending you, but it's the only thing i can think of. try using a classic or gamecube controller and see if spyro does the same thing.|`|rqUGVWKYaa	yeah my friend was having the same problem and they just bought a new wii and it stopped flipping you might just have to get a new wii.

I use them all the time.|`|5bHX51Ihaa	Add ons are allowed as long as they do not break ToS (Terms of Service). <br>  The only issue is that some addons that seem perfectly fine and don't seem like they could be a violation of ToS may actually be a problem (for instance, using the addon "Spotter" which automatically switches between Find Minerals and Find Herbs could possibly get you in trouble, as it's a kind of "automatic play", which is against ToS, though no one I know has had that problem yet).<br>  <br>  I made a list of all the addons I use with links to where I downloaded them from if you're interested (<a href="http://dragoness22.livejournal.com/155911.html)." rel="nofollow">http://dragoness22.livejournal.com/15591...</a>|`|wg8SQQjEaa	yes as long as the addons are not cheats, such as speed enhancers or anything else that improves the performance of your characters ablities or defenses.<br>  <br>  curse.com is a safe site to get add-ons.|`|tBsMH9kGaa	Yes they are, as long as there isn't any cheating I think you should be fine (:|`|tq0hOPQXaa	ayup.<br>  <br>  Although the wall walking one was banned.|`|AA11591656	Yes.

CjsFtjuhaa	From what I can remember when I went on, was that after you watch the Tower of Terror video in a special room, the Cast Member will seat you in three rows of seats (that look like an elevator).  There will be a few things that happen before the ride actually starts - just saying that you have entered the "Twilight Zone".  The elevator moves down a few floors, and then shoots up to the top, where your picture will be taken.  This picture only takes a few seconds, and then you are dropped (pretty fast) back down.  It is a really fun ride!<br>  <br>  I went on YouTube and found a video for you, just showing what happens on the ride, and no, I did not create this video. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HSgcshYf2s&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HSgcshYf...</a>|`|NuJ75Isnaa	Starting off you will movie up a little bit to a couple of floors, then it will do a couple of little drops and then shoot you to the top, where they will take your picture (SO SMILE BIG!!!!!) Then it will go up and down a few more times and then that's the ride. I know it seems short just reading it but its actually a really fun ride.|`|AeDUFMDDaa	go up like a real elevator but you also go forward for a bit down the hall and i remember a ghost appearing  on that floor then you drop, go up again drop again|`|9PQ3bRsqaa	First, you go up like a regular elevator. But when the ride starts, you go up and down really fast multiple times. Have fun!|`|xbQnBAdIaa	You start going up slow like an elevator while its telling a bit of a story before u drop for the first time then u just go up and down fast|`|y7qJayDVaa	Slowly, it creates anxiety.<br>  <br>  "Say goodbye to the real world!"|`|YiUQacWRaa	Real elevator

Use the free shipping option so you can avoid shipping.|`|A0ArcnUAaa	everywhere they sell board games|`|tZu3p6fEaa	go to Target or Walmart.|`|gQpoSC6Baa	like any store in the world.  target and barnes and nobles.  i saw them there is morning.|`|1atqVEFXaa	You can get the game at wal-mart for $24.87 they also have apples to apples junior for $20.27 you can get it online or at the store good luck.

bS5wpKvOaa	If you just started, Don't play easy.  Go straight to Hard or Normal.  As if you get to used to easy/normal, then advancing into hard and expert become a HUGE challenge, and people like to laugh at people who can't do the game on expert.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now then.  The Battle Rifle is the most all around weapon to use.  After that, the assault rifle, or a Carbine.<br>  <br>  Against flood, use a Shotgun, Sword, or Plasma Weapons (Duel Plasma Rifles burns right through them easily)<br>  <br>  Against Brutes, Battle Rifles, Shotgun, or duel SMGs.<br>  <br>  Against Grunts, any kind of fire arm will due.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (Note:  I left out Explosive weapons)|`|YSmYkc5Yaa	Well, if you're talking about Campaign, you can play on the easy level.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about matchmaking, there aren't "easy" modes, but you'll be a rank of 1 so you'll be matched against other beginners (hopefully). Play social games. Maybe practice in custom games to get used to the movement and gun control and the button layout.<br>  <br>  As for weapons... every weapon takes some sort of skill to use. I've found that a lot of people have a "special" weapon for them personally. One that they're extra good at. Like me, my weapon of choice is the sniper. I can snipe really well, so I focus on sniping. You'll most likely figure out which weapon you enjoy and do the best with. You just have to play around with them to see which ones you like better. If I can't grab the sniper, I just use the Battle Rifle. It's a very basic weapon. <br>  <br>  The only way to learn and get better is to play and practice. That's all I did. Go into social games and play play play.|`|J1elZSMUaa	I reccomend just playing the story on the easiest difficulty. Try to use all the weapons to just get a good feel for the game before trying to go online and have no idea what to do.
kHRK66Mwaa	Personally, the xbox 360 controllers were easy to use. The game is very responsive and I had no problem pulling off the moves. <br>  <br>  However, if you really want to master and play on the top of your game against others, get a joystick. It makes a difference, especially if you play online.<br>  <br>  Here is a video of the arcade stick reviews: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/streetfighteriv/video/6204810/street-fighter-iv-arcade-stick-round-up?hd=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/stree...</a>

U1chPjvPaa	No, you need the base game.  You cannot install an expansion pack like Free time with out the base game.  The base game is pretty cheap now because its at least 4 years old.  The Sims 3 will be coming out later this year so you should be able to get a good deal on all Sims2's expansions.

MqJYhuQ3aa	No you don't have to beat Zero's missions. As a matter of fact, it would be easier to do flying school before the Zero missions.
qrDYcctfaa	I'm pretty sure that when you click icon it automatically updates any patches. Every Wednesday the server goes down and they make their changes.
AA12091477	You've got plenty of time before the new God Of War 3 game comes out. As of right now it's set for December of this year. I would say buy other games for now and in about 6 months start saving for God Of War 3. Otherwise you'll miss out on some great games coming out like Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Ghostbusters: The Video Game, Brutal Legend, Guitar Hero Metallica and others|`|UzV0jc2haa	its coming out late 2009 so whatever you think.  and i know this cause it said that on playstation.com|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	It will certainly be worth it but it's not coming out until late 2009- like december (supposedly). I wouldn't miss out on things in between but if your certain this is the only money your going to have between now and then and your a die hard fan it might be your cup of tea. It might come out to be an awful game it's bound to happen to every series sooner or later.|`|G2OdDlmjaa	dude how long will it take to save 50 bucks|`|9WSYMAG7aa	yes.|`|CQmITRetaa	yes, it is. The game is coming out in Q1 2010.|`|lUB6AwEJaa	there is plenty of time before the game comes out,so no need to start saving.unless if you have a ridiculously low paying job or no allowance,<br>  <br>  the game will cost just $60,and there's still like 6-8 months atleast before it arrives.|`|keCkgPboaa	just say no to other games for now and save for gow3!!!
MHzCLacmaa	Ponyta evolves into Rapidash at level 40. To evolve Riolu, you need to get him at max happiness during the daytime. You can increase happiness by battling with him, giving him massages at the Resort Area and Veilstone City, and by giving him vitamins such as Calcium. If has has a Soothe Bell, it will increase the effects.<br>  Dusk Stones evolve lots of Pokemon like Murkrow into Honchrow, and Misdreavus into Mismagius.<br>  Leaf Stones evolve almost any Grass type, like Bellossom into Vileplume.<br>  Fire Stone, like the Leaf Stone, will evolve almost any Fire type like, Growlithe into Arcanine.<br>  Shiny Stone evolves Togetic into Togekiss (to get Togetic, Togepi must have high happiness)<br>  Here is a great website that helps me a lot.|`|Pw1y449Daa	To evolve Ponyta, its very simple. Just train it up until it is lvl 40, then it should evolve into a Rapidash. I suggest if you want to evolve it fast, train it at the elite four (Switch the ponyta for a stronger pokemon) so that it gains lots of experience. If you have not beaten the elite four yet, then i suggest you train it at the place with the HIGHEST lvl of pokemon in the grass, cave, water, etc..<br>  <br>  To evolve Riolu, it requires some time to evolve. You need to max out its happiness in the morning time. The long way to do it is to keep lvling it up cuz everytime you defeat a pokemon with the riolu, the riolu will gain more happiness. You can check the happiness checker on the Poketch thing (Hold your DS stick on the riolu to see how many hearts it has). When it has 2 small hearts, then it should evolve. The fast way to evolve riolu is to give it berries or vitamins (I suggest berries, cuz vitamins costs a lot of money and you can plant berries to get more). The berries that make pokemon happier (But lowers their stat) are pomeg, kelpsy, qualot, hondew, grepa, and tamato berries. Each berry lowers a different stat (Speed, attack, defense, etc.) So i suggest you to give the berries to the riolu first before training or else it will lower the stats that it just gained. And all of this has to be done in the MORNING, i dont know why but you just have to do it in the morning.<br>  <br>  The Pokemon that can be evolved using a dusk stone are:<br>  Murkrow into Honchkrow<br>  Misdreavus into Mismagius<br>  <br>  The pokemon that can be evolved using a leaf stone are:<br>  Gloom into Vileplume<br>  Weepinbell into Victreebel<br>  Exeggcute into Exeggutor<br>  Nuzleaf into Shiftry<br>  <br>  The pokemon that can be evolved using a fire stone are:<br>  Growlithe into Arcanine<br>  Vulpix into Ninetales<br>  Eevee into Flareon<br>  <br>  The pokemon that can be evolved using a shiny stone are:<br>  Togetic into Togekiss<br>  Roselia into Roserade<br>  <br>  You can get more evolution stones from digging treasures underground, but its a high chance of digging one up. But if you beat the game, then you are more likely to dig a stone up.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|WXExyAlWaa	There are good sites that have encyclopaedias of everything to do with pokemon. I like <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/M...</a> it will tell you every thing about pokemon from how they evolve, what moves they learn in each game (Diamond is Gen IV, which is the default they show), and information from the anime. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Evolutionary_stone" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/E...</a> tells you what each stone evolves.|`|Kh0s5O2Caa	Pontya evolves at level 40.<br>  Riolu evolves off of happines.<br>  Dusk Stone: Misdreavus to Mismagius; Murkrow to Honchkrow.<br>  Shiny: Roselia to Roserade.<br>  Leaf: Nothing in sinnoh that I know of...<br>  Fire: Flareon.|`|f523aad10a6e03c662d2fefa21926090aa	evolving ponyta:LV40<br>  evolving riolu:make it bond with you, then LV up in day/morning<br>  leaf stone:gloom<br>  fire stone: eevee<br>  others: I don't know<br>  water stone: staryul, eevee|`|PzmVpsmYaa	you can evolve ponyta with a fire stone. riolu evolves if he is happy. i think he evolves in pal park.
cCAGstnpaa	The Los Angeles County Fair. It is supposed to come in March this year. It is the biggest carnival in the United States. It has over 72 rides, and it even has bungee jumping! Have lots of fun!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|63ERCghTaa	Oh In San Diego?<br>  Erm..Well I Live on the Eastern Side of the U.S<br>  If you ever get a chance to stop by during August in Gaithersburg, Maryland, I recommend the Montgomery County Agricultural Fair. I think it is the largest Carnival on the Eastern Time Zone. It has over 107 rides and Each day, theres a show. Like for example, Monster Truck Shows, Trailer Trash Shows and other farm stuff like pig races and other things. Its only avaliable in August and remains for at least 3 weeks or so.
SOPRt0Ffaa	Wreaths: small, medium, and large|`|JtcVwK2Caa	How about making cards? If you get little cellophane bags to put your finished cards in and also provide an envelope, you could make cards for birthdays, Mother's Day, Easter, thank you cards, sympathy cards, congratulations or baby cards - whatever event is coming up would be good for card ideas. You ould need some card stock and embellishments - try shopping at your local craft shop for these. <br>  <br>  Here's some sites to give you ideas for card making:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.papercraftcentral.com/cardmaking.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.papercraftcentral.com/cardmak...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.splitcoaststampers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.splitcoaststampers.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.card-making-world.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.card-making-world.com/</a>
