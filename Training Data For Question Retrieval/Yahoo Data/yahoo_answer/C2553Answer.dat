The highest gear should over-dive or very close to it.<br>  <br>  I have a 6 speed now.  I often skip a gear or 2 when shifting...no pblms.  I use 5th gear on expressways around 55 mph.  6th is for higher cruising speeds.  You'll have very little torque in the highest gear so passing requires a downshift.<br>  <br>  Get the 6 speed|`|OffM2Ndiaa	5 speed means less shifting around the city|`|PlcKGtrgaa	auto would be not shifting gear through traffic hours or jams.<br>  <br>  manual would be better gas mileage if driven right, and the with six gear meaning during crusing speed on Highway it'll be at lower RPM then an auto do to an extra gear it can reduce the stress on the gears and transmission.<br>  <br>  i would suggest you choose which ever your more comfortable with because buying a car is a big investment, dont listen to anyones input that will lead you to making a decision you will regret.<br>  <br>  if you enjoy performance and the ability to shift at which ever RPM you choose then manny would be the way to go.<br>  <br>  if your not that good with manual and would perfer the safety of an automatic, ( you wont have to be aware of the shift time / rpm and it willl reduce your chance of spinning wheels and getting in to an accident during winter if your not a good driver with manual )<br>  <br>  hope this helps-<br>  good luck on your purchase|`|hm6HQvqNaa	I would go with the 6 speed both 5 and 6 are over-drive and since you want to pump up the power and speed you will need the extra gear for mileage. You will find the really isn't any extra shifting with the 6 speed because you wont make it beyond 4 or 5 in city traffic without luggin It.|`|AYvFuGzjaa	If you are looking for speed, you need to know the gearing of the tranny before you commit,  The higher the ration, the faster the shift, the faster the car.  If speed is what you are looking for, though, stick with the 5 spd.

Sometimes it's on the left side, sometimes it's on the right, sometimes it faces up and sometimes it faces out, and sometimes it's on the back of the engine and you've got to lay on the floor/ground to read it.

fbc8c71fabc8e8334fac52a964c52539aa	No blower (afterburner) needed. Its all in the design. The Concorde and the Blackbird are very odd aircraft as they were designed to be operated a there max possible speed at all times. As a characteristic of that if they needed to conserve fuel they would actually push the throttles up! They were most efficient W.F.O. It would often put the Concorde is a tight spot cause if ATC needed them to slow down to hit a slot, that reduction in speed would cost them in fuel. As far as I know the only military aircraft that could even think about competing with the Concorde was the XB-70. The skies were a little less amazing after they stopped flying the Concorde. I saw it once in Kalamazoo MI. It was the 2nd loudest thing I have ever heard taking second only to a top fuel dragster. There is just something to said about a 8000 horsepower V-8. The Concorde was hands down the loudest aircraft I had ever heard. I was on the end of the runway on the side of a road and it went overhead folding its gear in a right turn. It was so loud it honestly hurt my ears for a second, I couldn’t get enough! It was just like an airshow, after it went by the only thing you could hear were your ears ringing and babies crying and car alarms!<br>  <br>  Also they used to ploish the Concorde during maintenence to help its laminar flow. Its limiting factor on its top speed was the nose cone temp! It was limited to 260deg F,  if I remember correctly. They would warn first time passengers that it's take-off was as they would say "rather sporting". With a thrust to weight ratio of 2.71 I would say so! For comparision reasons a 747-800 has a thrust to weight ratio of 3.64 to one.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	Some modern aircraft can exceed mach 3....<br>  <br>  It used afterburner|`|b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	It sure was an impressive aircraft. In operation the Olympus' afterburners are shut down after it crosses Mach 1.7, so it is indeed supercruising. <br>  <br>  Don't be so hasty in belittling the fighters. They dont need to outrun their quarry, they just need to get them into missile range. They are deployed such that they dont have to burn insane amounts of fuel to fly thousands of miles and arrive tired at the battle scene. <br>  <br>  <br>  The SR-71 didn't have the range of the Concorde mostly because it had about a third of the Concorde's fuel load.|`|SwdWPAmBaa	Wikipedia:<br>  "The aircraft used reheat (afterburners) at take-off and to pass through the transonic regime (i.e. "go supersonic") between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7, and were switched-off at all other times. The engines were just capable of reaching Mach 2 without reheat, but it was discovered operationally that it burnt more fuel that way, since the aircraft spent much longer flying in the high-drag transonic regime even though reheat is relatively inefficient.<br>  <br>  Due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds, Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel taxiing to the runway.[22] To conserve fuel only the two outer engines were run after landing. The thrust from two engines was sufficient for taxiing to the ramp due to low aircraft weight upon landing at its destination.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, when operating Concorde at its design point at Mach 2, it was the world's most efficient jet engine.[16]"<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|e4OWhHP1aa	the F-22 raptor has the fastest capable supercruise apparently, althoughni cant remeber my sources. i have read it can travel at  mach 2.2, without afterburners, and i have also read that it can do 2.8, but i think tht that is a mistake. sorry, i came to answer this question, but i realsied that i know very little about the concorde, but i love military planes

HXvX20XAaa	Well if I could actually show you it would be easier lol but given the circumstances ill try to explain. Set the cd player to flat on the eq then turn up the volume to as loud as you listen to it normally. From there you adjust your gains frequency filters etc on your amp. After the sub sounds good with no distortion and has the sound you desire you adjust the cd player settings. If you listen to rap and bassier music you want the lo -3 mid 3 hi 4 approximately. The hpf should be around 63 or 80hz. The low is usually good for loud mid is not really necessary on loud. The sla or source level adjust is ok around 1 at most 2. Sub setting 1 should be wnor and sub setting 2 can be set at 63 or 80hz as well. As for bass just one or 2 but it doesnt make a big difference. I think thats about everything but I couldve missed something. Also you can look at bmx1 and bmx2 along with comp 1 and comp 2 under function. Im not quite sure how they work but I know the sound difference in my subs was huge after playing with that. Setting the hpf at 80 wont allow low freq aka bass play on your interiors. The sub setting hpf at 80hz doesnt allow higher freq than 80 hz play through the sub. I just gave you an example of how I tuned my system hope it helps.|`|118f5b8cbe4a93ac9b9bce5079cd3898aa	having a deck that controls a complete system can be tricky, but if you set it correctly, you can enjoy a full range of speakers all from one source.  switch the sub system off completely.  then set the system according to what you have connected to give you max volume before there is any distortion.  ie, presetting the best possible sound without the sub.  then connect the sub and put the system back to full volume.  gradually increase the input level on the amp untill you get the best sound from the sub, without overpowering the rest of the system.  only if the sub can take more but the amp can't do you start with gains.  be carefull with this as you are almost certain to overload the amp and sub using gains.

HXvX20XAaa	Yes that set up will work if you get the 4 ohm compvx so you can run the amp @2 ohms like mentioned. I would personally go with a kicker zx750.1 amp instead though. I had the same set up but my sub was an L7 which has the same rms as the vx. It is the perfect match and kicker always runs the best with other kicker products. I installed for 3 years at circuit city and know for a fact that the vx and 750 slam together. Oh and by the way you wont blow the sub if you run it with the amp youre talking about as long as you corectly set the gain and dont overpower the sub. Plus kicker is known for their durable subs. If you do go with that amp dont worry about blowing the sub.|`|CtxreHwDaa	yes although the sub is going to blow out if u crank it to long....find an amp that has a rms at or a little lower than 750watts|`|VIWl8tRVaa	yeah|`|MiulNPYNaa	it'll work, get 4 ohm version if you are running one sub.|`|K6YSZES9aa	direct answer?<br>  <br>  it will work.<br>  <br>  go for the kicker deal... you'll be good with that.

b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	If it is a Mk XIV vs the "D", I'd rather be in the Spitfire. The XIV had every possible advantage over the P-51D, including roll rate. Unless the Mustang pilot forces the Spit into a fuel draining proxy fight there is nothing it can it can do against the Spit.<br>  <br>  I assumed equal pilot skills and selected two comparabale models of these aircrafts.|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	Since the Merlin-Mustang didn't enter combat in the WTO until February 1944, we have to compare it to a Spitfire of the time.  Either a Spit 9 or 14.<br>  <br>  So let's say P-51D vs Spit 14.<br>  <br>  Spit 14 would clean the Mustang's clock.  Why?  More maneuverable, greater firepower (four 20mm cannon and four .50 cals vs six .50 cals.).  The speed difference is negligible.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	The Spitfire will turn tighter and climb faster because it is lighter.<br>  <br>  The P-51 Mustang has higher speed because of better aerodynamics.<br>  <br>  It is going to pilot skill, generally the Mustang can escape from the Spitfire, but the Spitfire cannot escape from the Mustang - it can stay out of the Mustang's gun sites, but it will run out of fuel much sooner.|`|f05ea7b6535ace20ef9808478efbef84aa	The P51a Mustang was first ordered by the British,proved disappointing and was relegated to ground attack with the R.A.F.<br>  Despite protests from the American suppliers the British<br>  tried the Merlin engine,proven in the Spitfire which vastly improved the Mustang,leading to the P51 series.<br>  Specifics of performance for the Spitfire and Mustang.<br>  Rate of climb.Spitfire was superior.<br>  Firepower.Comparable.<br>  Agility.Mustang better in rolls,Spitfire in turning and loops.<br>  Performance at height.The Mustang reached its best performance at height,where it was on a par with the Spitfire.The Spitfire was superior at all other heights.<br>  It's fair to say the Mustang,was the best escort fighter  for the Allies,but the Spitfire was the better dog fighter.<br>  This is substantiated by German and italian airmen,such as Adolf Galland who stated the Spitfire was a far more dangerous opponent than the Mustang.|`|c7OOmkLXaa	The P 51 was the hot rod of Europe for a single engine fighter but it would also depend upon which Spitfire you were to pick on. What a lot of people do not know is that toward the end of the war there were plenty of Spitfires  that had the Rolls-Royce Merlin 73's with a two stage supercharger and nitrous-oxide,the Mustangs never had that. It was not common knowledge because it was captured German technology that was used against the Germans in the Spitfire and the Supermarine. The German Fw-190 was a race bred aircraft of the 30's that was easily converted into a fighter and in it's final version was equipped with nitrous. Once one was captured intact that answered the question of why it was able to outrun allied aircraft at will. The Supermarine had been developed primarily to keep the 190 in check,and it did, for a while,until the discovery of nitrous injection. If you really want to read about the most incredible aircraft of WWII,it is hands down the DeHavilland Mosquito. A twin engine aircraft that was the fastest piston engine aircraft of WWII the only plane to ever chase down a "buzz bomb" and shoot it down,and it was made out of wood! Go to Amazon and buy the book "The Mosquito Log",you won't be able to put it down. In the beginning nobody wanted it ,in the end they could not build them fast enough. They served in every roll an aircraft could serve,they were the very first night fighter,a recon plane, a bomber a fighter-bomber and even cargo. They were absolutely feared by the Germans because of their speed,flat level flight was nearly 500 MPH in it's last design. Sad thing is very few still exist,most were burned after the war due to damage from wood worms. Those that do are in museums or are in northern climates where wood worms can not thrive.|`|SwdWPAmBaa	it really depends on the pilot....both planes were good.|`|0CkFC43raa	the P51D and the later model spitfires were two of the best aircraft to fly in the european theater. both handled quite well, but the mustang had longer range and a higher top speed than the spitfire, and had better guns. the spitfire used six .303 caliber guns, and the mustang used six .50 caliber guns. if the pilots are equal, then the one that forces the other to fight at a disadvantage will usually win.<br>  <br>  in my opinion most of the time the mustang will win due to the greater firepower.|`|HvSPJZHnaa	By far the Supermarine Spitfire!!!

Now the reason the clutch has gone out, is more than likely, because you have a leak in the hydraulic system, full pressure is not getting to the release cylinder causing it not to fully disengage. This will cause the clutch to over heat and damage it.|`|GAMkUH9Taa	That sounds like it could possibly be a major issue.

24kFbAdsaa	Since she left the scene, there's not real problem.<br>  <br>  I would call the police and file a non-injury, no-damage accident report.  Why?<br>  <br>  What's to prevent her from going to the police and filing a hit-and-run charge against you, going to the chiropractor and filing a claim against your insurance company.  She may have gotten out of her car to get your license plate number (if you have a front plate).<br>  <br>  Future reference:  Always exchange info between cooperative drivers.  Make a written report to yourself about the details of the incident (date, time, place, circumstances, etc).  Do this as soon as possible, within hours.  Date and time your report.  Do this in case you have to answer questions later.|`|kY3waNn1aa	you should exchange all information at any type of accident small or bog there may be hidden damages later and or if you can solve the problem between both of you don't involve the insurance so it dose not go up and ruin both of your records|`|pZvJpuJTaa	You should always carry a disposable camera in your glove box for instances like this.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter how bad the damages are, you should always exchange information.

d5bd94bc29fead0eb3d0ff44f02c14f8aa	Before you do any jetting you should check for intake/air leaks. the method I use is while the bike is idleing spray a conservative amount of brake cleaner on the union of the manifold and carb. If the bike stumbles its a smaller air leak, if it dies that is a big air leak. To re-jet you have to remove the float bowls (some carbs have a plug on the bottom that allows access to the main jet)<br>    Remove the main jet( a little brass screw with a hole in the middle). The jet will have a number stamped in it like ( 120 or 140). replace the jets with a couple sizes up ( if you have 140s go up to 150s).<br>    Run (ride)  your bike normally ( no choke) take a look at your plugs, the white ceramic portion surrounding the electrode should be a tan color( close to the color of dry cocoa mix). If your plugs are still white go up a couple more sizes.<br>    Be aware if you go up more than a few main jet sizes, you will need to change the pilot jet to the next larger size.<br>    It can be tricky to get it right and it does take some trial and error.<br>    If you are not really confident it may be worth putting it in the shop, especially with multiple carbs.<br>  <br>     If you know which are the fuel air mixture screws you could turn them in 1/4 turn to enrich the low speed feed ,but you run the risk of putting your carbs out of sync.|`|13b03e11c6d4e19fd46ec4ec6f23ec9daa	absolute best way....have it put on a dyno.  they'll dial it in razor sharp.  usual dyno time is about 60 bucks an hour in my area.|`|AA11885521	Dont turn screws,  If you have made mods and got this from your work. You need to rejet. If this has come to you by its self you need to get back in your carbs. Look at mid and low speed jets. Runing your bike on half choke is not a screw fix. Go back to work its all fun.|`|b08a3d3c59abc7f42597e0811d45a97eaa	not sure what carbys your running...<br>  <br>  can you raise the needle one notch??<br>  <br>  you might want to do this before you put it on the DYNO..<br>  <br>  but it will have to go on the DYNO at some stage to get it right...

They have also been the #1 selling small SUV in America since 2001.

I would really recommend the Ford Escape.

XBUeYE41aa	Guy at rally had exs lawyer try to get Harley for his fee. Bikes was paid for with 3 years of overtime and was liked. Lawyer had some people wearing full face helmets come into his office and break his leg- bike owner at times was at sheriffs office disputing lawyers claim on bike.  Lawyer tried to charge, while at hospital some more people came in and broke other leg and told him to stop trying to get bike. Bike owner talking to DA at the time disputing lawyers assault charge. Judge told lawyer to stop before arms broken. Judge noted that in the charged assult cases the sherrif dept and county DA that were supposed to prosecute those kinds of cases would be called as alabie witness's so would be conflicts at law. the other point judge made was if the lawyers chrages against motorcycle owner had some basis in fact-he set up attacks on lawyer-that it indicated he had at least 5 people willing to commit felonies against the lawyer and lawyer was facing more injuries. other legal point made by judge was motorcycle was noted in divorce settlement to go to man while station wagon was to go to wife, wife was responsible for lawyers fees outside of fees awarded in court that had come from small bank account. Lawyers attempts to sieze motorcycle without court order could be considered misconduct, suit could be considered barratry and law license suspended.  Lawyer and X wife later charged with dope possesion and transport for sale interstate- station wagon used to cross Illinois/Wisconsin line siezed. Motorcycle owner kept bike, got custody of daughter.

c48nm70gaa	We need to know the exact year make and model of your car. I've never heard of re-gearing axles. Unless you've added a ton of horsepower the axles themselves wouldn't be affected. Usually the ring and pinion gears are the first to suffer. 35" tall wheels and tires wouldn't fit under a lifted pick up truck! Depending on which rear third member you plan to use the axles have splines on the inside of the center section on a machine with a hobbing cutter. Full floating rear ends such as a racing Ford 9" rear has splines on both ends of each axle.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Depends on the gears you want, affects the price.

0gI7XUReaa	Your stock speakers are meant to handle the power from your stock radio, when you add the extra power from a aftermarket radio your speakers can become distorted due to the extra power when your turn the radio up louder. I would recommend buying a sub or subs to get your bass that you want, if you just want a little bass to your system get a cheap bass tube that will be a simple install. OR you could spend about $200 and get a decent set of after market speakers for your doors and rear deck. This will get rid of the distortion and they will sound better.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	i had the same problem, after i installed an aftermarket deck my speakers distorted after a certain volume (stock speakers)<br>  <br>  simply just get all new speakers to replace your stock ones.<br>  <br>  _____________________________________<br>  edit:<br>  <br>  no need to get an amp at all for your speakers<br>  just replace your stock with them, and dont get a 5 channel amp for 4 speakers and a sub, it wont power your sub half as much as it should be<br>  <br>  just replace all your stock speakers, and as far as a sub goes get a mono(1) channel amplifier and 1 sub, make sure the RMS output of the amp and the RMS watt ratings of the sub are equal and not more so you dont over power it.|`|uL5772kCaa	What specs are those for?

So while they were in there doing the timing belt they also replaced the water pump and other parts that are in the same area, what you don't want to happen is that you replace the timing belt and have the water pump go the next week and have to pay for all the labor again If I remember correctly it is about 4 hours labor for that fix., the parts are relatively cheap if you trust this person to do it right the first time I would say go for it but If you don't take it to a reliable shop and ask how much it will be for a timing belt to be replaced and see if they recommend that you do all the parts in that area.

AA12261615	there is a procedure on doing that one and you don't pump those, you gravity bleed them out ,if you continue to pump the master cylinder it will do damage to it and you will also not get as good of a clutch from it as if you  gravity bleed it,i know i did one this week and it takes about 2 hours to get one to gravity bleed out but you will get a real good clutch from it and you wont damage anything.im telling you the right way to do this, open a bleeder up on the slave cylinder and let it gravity bleed and don't let the master cylinder go dry at any time,once you get a steady stream of clear fluid from it close it off and  slowly mash on the pedal this will remove any remaining air from it,good luck.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	You can try this site, <a href="http://www.autorepair.about.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.autorepair.about.com</a>  I think that will help.

946109a893be7ef89b872c04100dd058aa	Very easy to do. Get a winterizing kit from West Marine that includes a 5 gallon container with hose attachment, flush-out attachment for the lower unit, and a case of non-tox anti freeze.Get a can of engine fogging spray. Warm up the engine by hooking up the flush out attachment to the lower unit and a garden hose, let it run with the water on for 5 minutes. Do not start it until the garden hose is turned on! Hook up the 5 gallon container to the flush out attachment with the clear hose provided. Fill the container with a/f  and place it on the transom. Put the flush out on the lower unit over the water intakes. Open the valve on the 5 gallon container so the a/f flows, it will drip a lot until you start the engine. get the flame arrestor of the engine and start it up. It will take that 5 gallons quickly so act fast. Start shooting the fogging spray into the air intake after 1 gallon of a/f is sucked in. Shoot the spray until the engine dies out if you can, or at least until it smokes a lot. Very important that you do not let the engine run out of the non-tox a/f. It will have enough in it when you see the a/f running out of the exhaust and it does not look diluted, so shut the engine down when you reach that point. spray the engine down with silicone spray to keep it from corroding. <br>  Then you also have to winterize any system that has water in it: fresh water, head, salt water wash down, etc. You should also change the engine oil beforeyou winterize the engine, and the lower unit oil.

The cost factor is definitely less by far if you do it yourself BUT more expensive if you fail to do something right. <br>  <br>  Remember, this is something you will only do once a year and you HAVE to do it right the first time or it's going to cost you in the spring when you want to fire her up and take her out.|`|Y6f7HMqSaa	It sounds like you a new boat owner/operator.<br>  <br>  First off, this is one of the MOST important maintainence duties for a boat with an inboard engine.  Failure to have this properly done will result in $7,000 to $9,000 in replacement costs.   When water freezes, it can do a better job than a wrecking ball in destroying expensive engines.<br>  <br>  If you plan on doing this yourself, you will need the following:<br>  <br>  Service manual for your Mercruiser's model and year<br>  <br>  Fogging oil (comes in a spray can)<br>  <br>  Fuel stabilizer<br>  <br>  WD-40 to spray down the engine block to prevent rusting and corrosion.<br>  <br>  Environmentally safe anti-freeze, preferrably the RV/Marine Anti-freeze.

This is not for your beginner or novice to attempt without a highly experienced individual to supervise.<br>  <br>  In short, it is JUST as cheap to have a certified Merc shop to winterize your boat as it is for you do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Go and get it winterized at a certified Merc shop.

0Mj9b0Aoaa	More than likely there is a leak somewhere.  Might be from the lines out of the tank, but it could be anywhere.  Premium gas will not make your bike smell like gasoline any more than regular would.|`|HfeSTtcPaa	because its either a leak or its burning gas|`|LPsmRI5Oaa	I've never had a bike that didn't smell like gas. Unless there is a visible leak somewhere I wouldn't worry about it too much. I don't keep up with the newer bikes as much. If it is carbureted it's just gas evaporating out of the carb, if it's fuel injected I don't know what it is. If it's parked in the sun it may just be from the tank vent. Try shutting the gas off when not in use.
ttbXQEJ8aa	Varies from one state to another. Most only require a signed title, some need to be notarized some don't. (most titles have a section that must be signed releasing loans if bike was ever financed) Bill of sale is usually not needed if you have title. Also many states require a certified VIN inspection if bike comes from out of state. <br>  <br>  As to tags and reg. In most states they are owned by the former owner and cannot be transferred. In other states (like Cali) the tags stay with the bike not the owner. <br>  <br>  Best to check with your County Clerk that sells tags. (some states it is the DOT instead of CC) Most states have thes regulation posted on their DOT web site.|`|W1q9hV2Naa	You need a bill of sale from them, title and the last tag receipt so you can have it put in your name.  Ask if there is any known problems too.  If they are selling it AS IS, you'll have no recourse against them if it falls apart 2 miles down the road.  Ask to have it looked at first by a mechanic, if they have problems with that, don't buy it.  Good Luck and just use your common sense.  Take Care.
I7NkFJo2aa	I would only add that if you can't blow it off with a 2000 psi water blaster then it won't fall of at 6, or 26 knots.  If the surface is pressure washed, allowed to dry or scrubbed with scotchbrite type pads while wet it should take most finishes well - the primer is to chemically and mechanically bond differing antifouls and other materials together, like soft or hard - best to stick with what has been working, and only growl it right back if its at the twenty coat thick relief map ugly stage.  If you have the identical antifoul to last season the primer should not be required for a well scrubbed and already firmly bonded surface - unless the manufacturer states otherwise, or the paint actually is flaking off the base surface.  Unless you are in a formula class the drag difference is minimal compared to weed or scum anyway so don't try for a topside finish unless as finicky as I am  (No one can see it but it's perfect down there - makes us feel good but the boat doesn't care as long as the stuff is on there and stuck well).<br>  <br>  I am looking into a sonic growth suppressant system - looks good on paper but requires 20W minimum 24/7.<br>  <br>  Do not ever paint over your anodes, if they are crudded up with scale and metal salts abrade them until shiny metal is exposed - they are not effective unless the have good contact with the water and the metal parts of the boat!!  If they are half gone I would renew them.  There are probably more than you think on your boat and in the engine systems.  They are very cheap compared to a new leg or intercooler.  Zinc for salt water, magnesium for fresh.<br>  <br>  Issues with copper based antifoul and aluminium are very real - some groups of metals are completely incompatible with some types of antifoul.  Read the directions very carefully, and if there are specific primers and coatings required for a (for example) sail drive then do exactly what the manufacturer instructs.  No deviation and you will have total backup.<br>  <br>  I note that most failed tilt and steering rams externally, are on legs etc. with very corroded anode blocks.  Just an observation.<br>  <br>  Happy maintenance, we all have to do it....|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	You need to scuff it and take the glaze off to give the primer something to stick to.|`|jEnUxoNNaa	No need to scrape, just lightly sand the old antifoul paint after the hull has been pressure washed. The idea is to 'key' up the hull surface so that the new primer will take to it easily. The no-sand primer NEEDS sanding; it's a good product, but you must sand first.<br>  Only other thing to be concerned with is old and new antifoul (and primer) compatibility. Make sure that they are compatible.<br>  Happy sailing!|`|AA10232063	If you are doing a new boat you must first remove all of the wax.  Ammonia with  several washings works.  Then follow the directions to the letter for the no sand primers.  They can be a bit cranky if applied wrong.  Be sure the paint is compatible with the primer.  Weather plays a factor.  Wait for the proper day so you have the proper weather and time window to do it right.<br>  <br>  To re coat do not use no sand primer.  If you are unsure of what paint is on the boat now,  there are some primers you can use to be sure the topcoat in compatible.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	if the old paint is in good shape you need to sand it lightly after a good pressure wash.. a light sand should do it. make sure the new paint is compatible with the old. if not then you will need primer. any exposed aluminum thru fittings must have their own paint. no copper base on aluminum.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	With the new paints is your old a hard paint or soft> As 1 will not work over the other> Ask at West Marine they will give you what you need> No primer as the old paint will still be good and usable as a base coat> Sand first>

I can't say for sure because I haven't seen your car, but I can tell you that I fixed this problem more than once and in every case it was  the neutral starting switch. Ford routes the wiring low under the chassis and occasional, this wiring will drag on brush or even cardboard box left in the road and pull the wires slightly loose from the transmission. The source below is about the 1998 but this situation is the same for many model years.

Today's engines are remarkable compared to 20 years ago, and our technology is so advanced at this point. But, you never know.<br>  <br>  When I was a teen and into top fuels drag racing, the 6 second quarter mile seemed unachievable. Then, a few of the drivers slipped under it.

Poorly sealed flanges and bleed tubes can rob efficiency.<br>  <br>  2. Run the engine hotter and faster. This can improve thrust faster than it costs in fuel flow. It poses an increased risk of structural problems, which in turn causes safety concerns - which is of course why it is not done on a regular basis already.|`|4GMUPFefaa	keeping it shut off. you are getting back exactly what you are putting in to it, that is 100% efficiency.

Check that the clutch & gearbox are PERFECT & then offer them 1,200. Make sure that the 4x4 works correctly - DON'T engage it on tarmac, park on grass & move off. The back wheels will spin. Engaging 4H will immediately send power to all four wheels & it should pull away cleanly. Disengage 4WD & reverse in a straight line for about 3-4 metres with the windows open - you should hear a 'click' from the front wheels as the auto hubs disengage.  Take it for a drive. It should pull cleanly, with the turbo giving steady power from 2,000 - 2,500 revs, and should easily cruise at 75-80mph. Make sure there's no whine from the gearbox in any gears. The engine bay should be spotless: At 160k miles, mine uses or leaks no water or oil at all.

You also might check your ignition switch. Mine did the same thing. I replaced the switch and never another problem..  Go to Harbor Freight Tools. They sell ohm meters dirt cheap, about $5.00.|`|AA11833271	Hello, Im sorry to trouble you by contacting you on one of your questions.

But def check spark, fuel. but one day my s10 would start and run great and next day wouldn't start.... all because of the cap it was very weird. same thing on my buddies 98 blazer, had a couple cylinder miss fires but all cylinders were getting spark, fuel they replaced injectors and all kinds of other stuff once again was just a bad cap. both of our caps were aftermarket not OEM Equipment. i'm never one to buy parts from the dealer but in this case I highly suggest if you put cap and rotor on just buy it from the dealer save some head aces down the road.

4f794ec7691416e516e1475a13f3f2caaa	I would be extremely reluctant to fly in any aircraft which has a disability.  Having said that, I have flown a number of times with my wife, who required the use of a wheelchair and in-flight oxygen, We always made clear her requirements at the time of booking the flight, again when we phoned the airline before the flight to check that the flight was unchanged and also when we checked in at the airport.Only on one occasion did we have a problem when we had boarded the aircraft and were asked to disembark. We were then told that we couldn't fly as the oxygen hadn't been put on board as promised.  I proceeded to make a lot of noise and said that if we couldn't fly, neither would the plane. (I had no idea how I was going to stop it). Eventually the oxygen turned up and all was then well.  Before the aircraft landed we checked with the cabin attendants that there was a wheelchair waiting for her when we landed.  The staff always ensured that we  boarded the aircraft first to give us a chance to get settled and left last to let us disembark in comfort.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Flew in a DH-2 Beaver once that was missing a wing tip and had a cracked exhaust on  5 cylinder. Does that count? I think the pilot had a disability too. Apparently he could not see trees too well; hence, the broken wing tip.
t3Mq9Tooaa	No. The diesel is injected through a pump that is mounted directly to the block, and is powered by the rotation of the engine, and is timed. Think timing gears. An eletronic injection system would have to use timing sensors, and with the amount of vibration that comes from the 6.2 it would destroy it in short order, not to mention it would just beanother part to cause intermittent problems making a diagnosis harder. There is nothing wrong  with the setup they have now. The injector pump creates a lot of pressure, and the pressure is adjustable. But you can put it too high very easily. A properly timed and adjusted injector pump gives great mileage. I get 17-25 mpg's with mine. Check it out in the link to my photobucket page. The way a diesel is injected is not the same as a gasser, think power-washer versus aerosol can. Diesel is under high pressure, that creates the heat that ignites the atomized fuel, where as a gas engine uses a spark to ignite the fuel air mix. I learned everything about diesels working and building mine, the same with gas engines, and diesels are by far easier to work on.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	No, I don't find any such listed in their lastest catalog.

BQPM0yROaa	If you plan to carry a passenger a 250 is simply not an option. With about 25 RWHP on tap and a dangerously low 13 ft,lb of RWTQ you'll barely have enough power to move yourself along at highway speeds. I also wouldn't trust a bike with such a small,flimsy frame and suspension with holding 2 people at highway speeds as I've seen people get stability issues on 2 up on lower-spec 600cc bikes at highway speeds. You will also have to get used to riding around at over 6000 RPM all the time non-stop and over 8000 just to keep up with traffic on the highway. Sure the bike may have a 90 MPH top speed but good luck getting anywhere near there in any reasonable amount of time. The 650r on the other hand and has enough power, chassis, and suspension to handle anything your average rider will throw at it without being hard to control in the slightest. 2up is no problem, calmly cruising on the highway is no problem, a short fun blast to 100 MPH on an empty road is also no problem. However the bike is still very tame and easy to ride, probably easier in fact than the 250 since you don't have to worry about keeping the revs up or getting passed by angry cagers because you struggle to keep up with the flow of traffic.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	250 ninjas are great first bikes.  They are even nice alternate bikes for those of us lucky enough to have a larger main ride.  They are capable of 90 mph all day long without damaging the engines, the only 250 that is even capable of that speed.  You will not have to worry about the bike "getting away from you".  They are quite capable of carrying a passenger and of doing rides much longer than the 100 miles or so you mention.  I personally have done 600 miles a day on mine.    Downsides-they are what they are-a small engined bike that will not break land speed records.      The newer models have an updated look and slightly detuned engine that allows more power to the lower and middle power band areas.|`|fl60KL8oaa	The baby Ninja is more than capable of any legal street usage.  It can do in excess of 100 mph.  The 2007 and earlier are physically slightly smaller than the '08 up, and thus a little easier to learn on.    As for passengers, as previously noted, not a good thing for a new rider; especially with someone not used to being a passenger.  My rule for a passenger was that they were to plaster their body to mine, arms wrapped around my waist, to rise when I rise, lean as I lean.|`|miyAb7cQaa	If you don't know how to ride the 250R would be best, it's light, not too intimidating, and cheap so you won't feel too bad if you drop it. If you do know how to ride hook up on the 650.|`|0g2fDpUbaa	if you are sold on that style of bike, choose the 650, but do yourself a favor and hold off on adding any passengers until you have a few hundred miles under your belt.  The way the bike handles can change dramatically with a passenger, plus, unless the passenger has a lot of experience riding on the back, you will both have to learn the way to move, lean and adjust at the same time.|`|r1WMBKvuaa	Take your time and get the right bike for your future needs. If you can just ride it and not succumb to peer pressure to show off and   go too fast when you know you shouldn't, get the bigger bike. You will outgrow the 250 in two weeks.

They where forced to back in 2001 when everyone saw how poorly their F-150 truck preformed in the offset crash test. Dont get me wrong I am a Ford guy to the end. But that truck was the worst preforming of the 4 tested at the time. Ford came back in 2004 with freash new F-150 and killed the same test! Since then they have been incorparating their quality into not only their Pickups but their other line's of cars and SUV's as well. And they not only have made great strides in the saftey of their cars and trucks, but also in the overall build quality, I'll refrence trucks alot because its what I know best. But if you get a chance take a seat or even go for a ride/drive in a 2003 or earlier F-150 truck and then do the same with the 2004 or newer F-150's the quality is noticably different between the two trucks. Ive noticed since 2004 Almost All Ford cars and trucks have been revamped to fit a more demanding standerd of quality by the american people.|`|L5ie6msYaa	the suck balllsss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To put a K20 with 170ish wheel HP installed and running will be in the $10,000-$12,000 range. Now there is NO way that the extra $8,000-$9,000 is worth 20 hp. You can add a simple bolt on turbo kit on the B18C1 for $4,000 installed and be making 300ish WHEEL HP, all the while STILL saving $3,000+ and being over 100 HP faster than the K20.

IlwVdf1Baa	If your just removing them,and not going to replace them, first disconnect battery terminals, take screws out of light mounts, remove mounts, cut the wires, separate them from each other at the place you cut them, then close off the cut end of the wire(s) with wire nuts or electrical tape.To be sure they'll be no problems, pull the respective fuses out of the fuse box. that will kill the wires from the fuse box to the removed lights. P.S. better quit riding at sunset!
wMNRBpMCaa	Just unscrew the throttle grip with the two screws which hold it together. The throttle cable will then come out.
lM9NvSwnaa	Well the carb end is easy, just simply lift the throttle shaft up on the carb and remove the end of the cable that goes slack. then push it back down and remove the other one.  Now I have not seen a VStar in about a year or more, but don't remember anything special about their cable routing, same as always-under the tank up thru the fork tree and up along the handlebars where it goes inside the plastic housing on the right side.  2 screws to remove the plastic housing and then whalla the cables are right there.  Installation is reverse of removal.  If it was me, I would take the cables off at the handlebar-easier to push tubing down than up.
f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	Simply take the gas tank off, wire them straight from the battery using the proper rated fuse/switch/wires for the load(s). If you piggyback off the headlamp circuit you will overload that circuit.  Mount the switch in an inconspicuous place on the chassis/frame with a good ground near the back/bottom of the tank, or front of the seat where its easy to reach and run the wires through looms under the tank. (that way no ugly wires all over the handlebars) There are several mail order catalogs offering model-specific light kits that look like they were designed for,and/ or compliment the style of the bike no matter what year.(Yamaha cruisers didn't hit the US market until the 80's)  If the kit comes with a relay, use it.

kgk3Yz9Naa	when you skid your car is out of Control...  sensors on the axil/wheels know when your skidding on a wheel so the abs pump ''pulses'' the hydraulic fluid in the braking system..it literally switches it on/off very quick...this in turn stops the skid and brings the car under control.........|`|f5ibT3WNaa	it keeps the brakes from locking up and you losing control of the car|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Prevents the car from going into a skid.|`|03ee34907dadd3ce913135c53012c9bfaa	ABS systems are an "anti skid" system that uses a wheel speed sensor of some type (either at wheel or in ring and pinion area on rwd trucks) to determine when one or more wheels are sliding. At this point the abs computer can "pulse" the brake pressure being applied to said wheels causing them to stop skidding. The vibration you feel in the pedal is the computer pulsing the valves in the abs system. ABS will not stop you any sooner. On the contrary abs equipped vehicles will take a longer time to stop. What it does is allows the driver to maintain steering to avoid an accident.|`|XsVDiZFHaa	In a car driven on slick surfaces without anti-lock brakes the tires tend to lock up, hence anti-lock. If a cars tires lock up at high speeds you will completely lose control, make no mistake about it. To counteract this the driver can pump the brakes repeatedly to try to hit that balance between no brakes and a lockup where traction and stopping power are found, or in a car equipped with anti-lock brakes the ABS system will do this for you. ABS is more effective than a human though since it can apply and remove breaking power hundreds of times a minute so the tire virtually never breaks traction. Sorry if i didnt word that so well.|`|qC6kel14aa	A sensor system measures the speed of rotation of the wheel relative to the forward speed. when you brake the sensor reduces the hydraulic pressure exerted on the brake pads/calliper just before the point at which the rotating wheel would otherwise lock up and you skid. so in effect it takes the brakes 'off' slightly.    Early ABS on motorbikes was thought to be the best thing since sliced bread, until when trying it out at the demo day, it transpired that this very early prototype ceased to work at 4 MPH and locked the wheels up! You have to release just before it locks up says the man,   Yeah, do i look that dumb that I'm going to buy that dumb idea Mr?    No but do now have it but I DONT DRIVE TO IT.

2cb3153c313f04e3810e6bc6151a9494aa	I'm going to have to disagree with the majority of what's been said so far... so first to correct a couple points in regard to Porsche's race cars and what you're likely to find in them.    The GT3 comes as either the GT3 Cup, which is homologated from the GT3 Road car, and the GT3RSR, which is homologated from the GT3RS road car.  The first is generally run in spec series or as a GT Class car in cost conscious series, and is outfitted with the same basic manual transmission from the basic GT3.  The rules under which the GT3 RSR is run is quite different... I've had the good fortune to ride in as well as drive these and every one was outfitted with a sequential gearbox with automated upshifts and manual downshifts (with a clutch).    In short, what is outfitted to the race cars will generally be whatever the governing rules allow, and will have little to do with what is outfitted on the street car.  If the rules allow for a fully automatic clutch AND there is an advantage to it, you can bet that Porsche will outfit it on the race car regardless of what is available on the road car.    so why?    The current PDK is a vast improvement over the tiptronic, but feedback I've heard from drivers who's opinions I trust has been mixed enough to make me wonder if the system as offered right now is simply not suited for the GT3 (remember this option was in development a few years ago and was passed over for the Carrera GT as it was considered promising, but simply not "there" when compared to the manual).    Given the quick development of the system though, it seems likely that it will make an appearance at some point in the GT3, but may not appear until the next model year or near the end of the current MY.|`|R8DXKrF1aa	Could be the weight issue, and with how it's setup, it might mess up the weight distribution of the car.  911s have been gaining some weight over the years.      or maybe they're just holding it off?  The 2010 GT3 RS is supposed to have the pdk and manual options.    so could be that it's meant for enthusiasts who would rather have a true manual over the double clutch gearbox even if it's faster.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	GT3, GT3 RS, and GT2 are race car versions of the 911.    Race cars do not have automatic transmissios or double clutch transmissions.    PDK=extra weight=worse handling and slower top speed.  PDK only helps with acceleration by 0.1 seconds.    The traditional manual transmission is what race cars use. So Porsche only uses manual transmissions in those cars.

The VIN is just that - a Vehicle Identification Number, specific to each car.    At least in New York state, the every-other-year vehicle registration is a bar coded sticker placed on the inside of the window on the lower left (driver's side).  If a meter maid has to ticket you, they just wave a bar code scanner over your registration bar code on your window, and the scanner prints out your parking ticket.  (In MA, no bar code, just a month/year sticker to put on your license plate for a new registration.)|`|RvVvaVsAaa	identifying the car with the dealership. could also have to deal with the VIN number|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	some car makers put a bar code and chassis number in the windscreen...or  some sort of city toll charge that is read by laser....or  well thats all i can thing off.|`|4b4d4f3bfe33461a02daa163629ada22aa	Since 1980, all manufacturers are required to assign a VIN Number (Vehicle Identification Number) to each and every car they build.

gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Muscle is not the best of ideas for autoX. A Shelby Cobra is a good track car but they're very expensive (certainly not under 10k). You're best off going for a Toyota Supra Twin Turbo rather than the 300ZX Twin Turbo, the 2JZ-GTE in the Supra can handle anywhere from 600-800hp on stock internals so perhaps dial up the boost on it, get a full suspension upgrade and some better brakes if you're turning it into a time attack car. The 300ZX is a great car but the engine isn't as reliable as anything else Nissan has made. Fun to drive, but probably not the best of ideas for track racing. The other option is a Subaru Impreza. You won't be able to find a non-thrashed STi for your budget but you'll definitely find a few WRXs. You can always ramp it up to STi spec anyway, it's not that hard or expensive.    N.B: The reason why I say muscle isn't that great for track racing is because their technology is very outdated. They'll end up being not as reliable as anything European or Jap import, not to mention their very hefty weight means loads of understeer, your corner speed will drop, and you won't get anywhere. The Dodge Avenger R/T would actually be better off than the V8s, but 236hp compared to 276-300hp from most imports doesn't sound appealing.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	The 300ZX was never a great autocross car.  Hopelessly uncompetitive in any Stock class, it would take a lot of work to make it competitive in one of the prepared classes.    In the "American Muscle" realm I imagine 90's-vintage V8 Camaro's and Mustang's fall into your price range.  The Camaro/Firebird is an OK autocross car out of the box but the Mustang takes a lot of work, depending on the year to make a really good job of it.  Fun project car I suppose since there is so much that has to be changed to get it right.  I autocrossed a Camaro once.  I thought it was overlarge for the purpose.  Not to my personal taste.    A late 80's/early 90's Mazda RX-7 is a good out-of-the-box autocross car.  I took the local Street Prepared championship back in 98' with one that had almost no mods (wheels, front sway bar, bushings that removed the 4-wheel steer effect).  Finding one in good order with a sound motor isn't going to be too easy though.  Avoid models with 14" 4-lug wheels.  The ultra-rare GTU is best.  I don't care for the turbo models - waaaaayyyyy too much lag for my taste, particularly for autocross.  A friend of mine dropped a Ford 5.0 V8 into a turbo body a couple of years ago.  He said the conversion was surprisingly easy.  The motor and suspension were heavily gone over and the car is scary fast.  I haven't driven it but I went for a ride on a quick autocross course and thought I was going to lose my lettuce.    A great pick if you can find one is the rare early 90's Toyota MR2 or MR2 Turbo.  Later versions of this car (they had 15" instead of 14" wheels) are the best picks as there were a few suspension quirks that were fixed on these.  Very much fun to drive.      To this day though I still think the best autocross car ever invented is the 1st and 2nd generation Mazda Miata.  Even in stock form these cars are faster on the autocross course than most modified cars.  We get upwards of 150 entries at our events and have plenty of nationally competitive drivers.  It is not unusual for half of the top 10 fastest cars overall at any given event to be stock Miata's.  Great fun to drive and they require absolutely nothing more than decent tires right out of the box.  If tweaking is your thing there is a dizzying array of options. Two guys in my club run supercharged Miata's that are insanely fast.

c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	No, not really.    You'll have to gut the engine, replace the piston and rods, replace the intake system, electrics to the engine, change the computer, and more.  You're talking thousands of dollars in work.  Ask your friend if you can have the rest of the engine with it.|`|2cb095e7fa5f072aade65134e1a9e821aa	Short answer is yes.....the better option would be to swap the entire drivetrain over to your ride. There are differences in the pistons used in the supercharged and naturally aspirated motors. The static compression ratio of a supercharged 1.6l mini (cough neon cough) motor will be lower than its non supercharged counterpart. The intake manifold would have to be swapped as well. SC minis have 2 map sensors 1 before the supercharger and 1 in the intake. This requires the engine wiring harness to be swapped also. The intercooler assembly wont fit under your stock hood. ECM will have to be flashed. Fuel pump upgrade might be necessary. I could keep going but you get the idea. It is not a bolt on proposition.  Dont hack up your mini. Sell yours and buy an "S"

This is usually the result of overworking the alternator, which is caused by a bad battery.

The reason the steering gets heavy is because you have power steering, no power = hard to turn.|`|pfdAtvFvaa	you need a new altenator your steering gets hevey because you have power steering and if you have no power the power steering won't work right

AA11264416	the only thing that looks worth anything is the filter but that doesn't mean thats even a high flow filter, it says the tube can be extended and can be bent in any angle, it just a way to try to sell it, it looks like a dryer hose, its not but it looks just like it, so i doubt it will last long, plus thats not a "cold air intake", a cold air intake is an intake system that takes air from either a scoop from the hood or from under the car, that just replaces the stock intake system so thats just an air intake kit, i have a K&N air intake kit on my truck, people want to talk trash about it but thats probably cause they didn't install it right, after installing mine you can't feel the HP gain but its there, only maybe 10 added on mine, but you could defiantly feel better acceleration, also the sound is the same while idling or cruising speed but when i floor it, the sound is a deeper tone, i would see about a K&N air intake kit if they make it for your car, or can get another well known manufacturer, just remember you get what you pay for, not always best to get the cheapest thing|`|txoXobsAaa	you know that those thing only make your engine sound cool right. theres is very little hp gain. maybe 2-3 at the most.|`|qzyyOEYAaa	100% True:<br>  <br>  You can buy a Dryer tube and make it your self for half the price then buy a Specter Filter.<br>  <br>  What you should do:<br>  Go with what you know is good and get a K&N Filter.

If you're talking about any other Skylines then you could try ebay, but most of them are 100% completely illegal even if it is "state registered". Now you're probably thinking well they're cheap in Japan and other countries so I'll just import one. Well it's not that easy. Most people don't want to hear this, but unless you have close to 100k it's not going to happen. A lot of people say that's bull shi*, but if you really think how bureaucratic our country is, it's pretty believable.<br>  <br>  If you do have 100k then you can import a Skyline, but only the R33 Skyline GTR and GTS from 1996 to 1998. The reason is because those cars were the only cars proven to the government that they were closely related to its US counter part, a car that's similar that was sold in the US, which was the Nissan 300zx. If you don't want to go through all the trouble of getting one legalized then you have to find a federal legal Skyline which there only about 120 of them in the US so good luck.

31Ttgqlbaa	About 30 minutes I'll say. It depends on the speed limit, traffic, and if there's traffic lights or 4 way stops.<br>  <br>  In response to the freeway answer below:<br>  Don't keep your speed at 50 mph. Go the speed limit or keep up with traffic. Keep a safe following distance from traffic ahead. Always check your mirrors and blind spot before passing. If there are cars in your driver side mirror, don't move over. If it's clear and after checking your blind spot, go for the pass. Move back in the right lane when the pass is complete after seeing the car you passed in your rear view mirror. Limit your time in the left lane and pass quickly. <br>  <br>  And as far as more problems on the street, I agree. You'll have to watch out for bicycles, people walking or crossing the road, drivers pulling out in front of you, etc.|`|WfYfF8CLaa	Here is a fun way to do this.   Drive in reverse.

You can't book a driving test without it. Then when you have passed you need to telephone or apply online for a practical test. If your really lucky & the waiting list is low you might get a test before you go back. Once your booked for a test you can then phone everyday to see if there are any cancellations. Also i would advise you get a driving instructor as our test is strict & its worth having lessons so you least have a good chance of passing your test. Most driving instructors won't take you on with a test booked until they have seen your driving & they are not obliged to let you have their car for the test if they feel your not ready so unless you have a car to take your test in you might find this difficult. Prepare as much as possible & practise behind the wheel as much as you can. Every bit of experience will help you.

nAzbLdBCaa	FIRST, there has to be more to the story, and you are in contract law.   If the total amount of money is low enough for small claims court, you need to file the paperwork with the court.  That you can do  yourself.   If you have the boat, as it sounds like, but the total amount of money is low, you might try arbitration, which many places now encourage.  Or, walk-away from the deal and recoup what ever you can.   If he says you didn't complete the agreement, and you say you did, the police will not get in the middle, unless it's written, and then you have proof that you paid in full, then only in a few states that have vehicle sales laws, for cars and boats, but keep in mind, It's him against the state, not you.

And since the car is almost 10 years old, you might need to do some repairs which will cost you a lot. I would recommend buying another car like a Mazda or Nissan. <br>  <br>  If you honestly want to buy this car, go check out the car. See if the engine runs good, every things on good, few scratches and bumbs and defiantly get CARFAX report for any crash history. If it clears good, then go for it, but I honestly wouldn't recommend if you should.

Do you think you could do many such trips? Is'n it better to get a car that's easier on gas so you get to take all  the little chicks about??|`|SqvU8U2Waa	most cars have governors, and no, it doesn't change a thing.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Almost all cars have a governor because of the tire ratings on the car. most govs are somewhere around 110 - 130 mph. Limiting a car to that much speed isn't really an incentive to insurance companies being that 110mph is still illegal.

For other uses, see Ohm's acoustic law.<br>   <br>  A voltage source, V, drives an electric current, I, through resistor, R, the three quantities obeying Ohm's law: I = V/R.Ohm's law applies to electrical circuits; it states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference or voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them.<br>  <br>  The mathematical equation that describes this relationship is:<br>  <br>   <br>  where I is the current in amperes, V is the potential difference in volts,and R is a circuit parameter called the resistance (measured in ohms, also equivalent to volts per ampere). The potential difference is also known as the voltage drop, and is sometimes denoted by U, E or emf (electromotive force) instead of V.[1] I is from the German Intensit?t meaning "intensity".[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The law was named after the German physicist Georg Ohm, who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. He presented a slightly more complex equation than the one above to explain his experimental results. The above equation is the modern form of Ohm's law.<br>  <br>  The resistance of most resistive devices (resistors) is constant over a large range of values of current and voltage. When a resistor is used under these conditions, the resistor is referred to as an ohmic device (or an ohmic resistor) because a single value for the resistance suffices to describe the resistive behavior of the device over the range. When sufficiently high voltages are applied to a resistor, forcing a high current through it, the device is no longer ohmic because its resistance, when measured under such electrically stressed conditions, is different (typically greater) from the value measured under standard conditions (see temperature effects, below).<br>  <br>  Ohm's law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a "macroscopic" level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an electrical circuit. Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general vector equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm's law, having variables that are closely related to the I, V and R scalar variables of Ohm's law, but are each functions of position within the conductor. See the Physics and Relation to heat conduction sections below.<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Elementary description and use <br>  2 Physics <br>  2.1 Magnetic effects <br>  3 How electrical engineers use Ohm's law <br>  3.1 Hydraulic analogies <br>  4 Temperature effects <br>  5 Strain (mechanical) effects <br>  6 Transients and AC circuits <br>  7 Relation to heat conduction <br>  8 History <br>  9 See also <br>  10 References <br>  11 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Elementary description and use<br>  Electrical circuits consist of electrical devices connected by wires (or other suitable conductors). (See the article electrical circuits for some basic combinations.) The above diagram shows one of the simplest electrical circuits that can be constructed. One electrical device is shown as a circle with + and - terminals, which represents a voltage source such as a battery. The other device is illustrated by a zig-zag symbol and has an R beside it. This symbol represents a resistor, and the R designates its resistance. The + or positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to one of the terminals of the resistor using a wire of negligible resistance, and through this wire a current I is shown, in a specified direction illustrated by the arrow. The other terminal of the resistor is connected to the - or negative terminal of the voltage source by a second wire. This configuration forms a complete circuit because all the current that leaves one terminal of the voltage source must return to the other terminal of the voltage source. (While not shown, because electrical engineers assume that it exists, there is an implied current I, and an arrow pointing to the left, associated with the second wire.)<br>  <br>  Voltage is the electrical driver that moves (negatively charged) electrons through wires and electrical devices, current is the rate of electron flow, and resistance is the property of a resistor (or other device that obeys Ohm's law) that limits current to an amount proportional to the applied voltage. So, for a given resistance R (ohms), and a given voltage V (volts) established across the resistance, Ohm's law provides the equation (I=V/R) for calculating the current through the resistor (or device).<br>  <br>  The "conductor" mentioned by Ohm's law is a circuit element across which the voltage is measured. Resistors are conductors that slow down the passage of electric charge. A resistor with a high value of resistance, say greater than 10 megohms, is a poor conductor, while a resistor with a low value, say less than 0.1 ohm, is a good conductor. (Insulators are materials that, for most practical purposes, do not allow a current when a voltage is applied.)<br>  <br>  In a circuit diagram, like the one above, the various components may be joined by connectors, contacts, welds or solder joints of various kinds, but for simplicity these connections are usually not shown.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Physics<br>  Physicists often use the continuum form of Ohm's Law:[2]<br>  <br>   <br>  where J is the current density (current per unit area, unlike the simpler I, units of amperes, of Ohm's law), σ is the conductivity (which can be a tensor in anisotropic materials) and E is the electric field (units of volts per meter, unlike the simpler V, units of volts, of Ohm's law). While the notation above does not explicitly depict the variables, each are vectors and each are functions of three position variables. That is, in the case of J, using cartesian coordinates, there are actually three separate equations, one for each component of the vector, each equation having three independent position variables. For example, the components of J in the x, y and z directions would be Jx(x,y,z), Jy(x,y,z) and Jz(x,y,z).<br>  <br>   <br>  Current flowing through a uniform conductor with a uniform field appliedThe advantage of this form is that it describes electrical behaviour at a single point and does not depend on the geometry of the conductor being considered. It only depends on the material of the conductor which determines the conductivity. That this is a form of Ohm's law can be shown by considering a conductor of length l, uniform cross-sectional area a and a uniform field  applied along its length.<br>  <br>  The potential difference between two points is defined as<br>  <br>   <br>  with  the element of path along the integration of electric field vector E. For a uniform applied field and defining the voltage in the usual convention of opposite direction to the field;<br>  <br>   <br>  Substituting current per unit area, J, for I / a (a being the cross section of the conductor), the continuum form becomes:<br>  <br>   <br>  The electrical resistance of a uniform conductor is given, in terms of conductivity, by:<br>  <br>   <br>  After substitution Ohm's law takes on the more familiar, yet macroscopic and averaged version:<br>  <br>   <br>  A perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no resistivity,[3] but a real metal has crystallographic defects, impurities, multiple isotopes, and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons scatter from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Magnetic effects<br>  The continuum form of the equation is only valid in the reference frame of the conducting material. If the material is moving at velocity v relative to a magnetic field B, a term must be added as follows:<br>  <br>   <br>  See Lorentz force for more on this and Hall effect for some other implications of a magnetic field. This equation is not a modification to Ohm's law. Rather, it is analogous in circuit analysis terms to taking into account inductance as well as resistance.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] How electrical engineers use Ohm's law<br>   <br>  Plot of I–V curve of an ideal p-n junction diode at 1μA reverse leakage current. Failure of the device to follow Ohm's law is clearly shown.Ohm's law is one of the basic equations used in the analysis of electrical circuits. It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components (resistors) specifically made for this behaviour. Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering. Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as "ohmic".[4]<br>  <br>  There are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear. An example is the p-n junction diode. The ratio V/I is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance.[5][6] However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the slope of the V–I curve (or inverse slope of the I–V curve, that is, the derivative of current with respect to voltage). For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law proportionality to be applied as an approximation.[7]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Hydraulic analogies<br>  A hydraulic analogy is sometimes used to describe Ohm's Law. Water pressure, measured by pascals (or PSI), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow. Water flow rate, as in liters per second, is the ana
