I have been coloring my hair from the boxed stuff for about 7 years now, and have never once been dissatisfied with my color results or fading.       But I recently began working at a hair salon as a receptionist, and when the stylists discovered I colored my hair myself, they all gasped and scolded me, and said boxed color is "so bad", but I didn't exactly get a reason why. I assumed it was a ploy to get people to spend 50 dollars more to get it professionally done, but I see nothing wrong with boxed color.       Anyone able to provide an intelligent response on the matter?

20090307185817AAliNdJ	Beauty & Style;Hair	ADVICE NEEDED!! What should I do about my hair-coloring problem?	Ok, I went in today to get my hair colored a lighter brown with blonde highlights and my natural color is a darker brown.  The color turned out really orange looking and NOT what I wanted, but my colorist attempted to make it look better (it was not her fault, just the way my hair lifted to that color) and we ended up coloring it 4 times in a row. Needless to say, my hair feels like straw right now. What I need to know is:   1) How long should I wait to color it again? Keep in mind that I now want to go to a darker brown.   2) When I go darker brown, do I have to worry about the color now being a orangish/gold and therefore affecting the outcome of this next coloring?

20090307182624AANuYCd	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Can I be a fashion model?	I'm 5'9'', 125lbs, and my measurements are 24-25-36. I'm also 22 years old, dunno if that makes a difference or not. I get discouraged because I've been scouted by a couple different agencies, but they wanted me to pay money. And I was also discovered by one of the casting directors for America's Next Top Model for an audition, tried out, but they didnt pick me. I have professional pictures, but I just dont know if they're good enough to make an agency go "wow!" I've spent plenty of money for these pictures, but Im not getting anywhere. If you think I can be a model, how should I go about it? And if you think I can't be a model, why not? Is there anything I can improve? Here are a few pictures...       http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/5441/cb...        http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/3328/cb...        http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/2221/cb...        http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/7090/cb...

Ive had pink in my hair for over a year and a half now at first it was the tips ( i had really long straight brown hair) and then I got the quarter pannel hilighted and did it teal pink and purple but that was hard to keep up so mostly it ended up pink.      then over the summer I got my hair cut and i kept the quarter pannel pink with layers so that the pink was hilighted more      and now im bored with my style and want to do something different so I was thinking about going back to all brown but I know Ill get bored with that.      My question is should i put the pink in someother way like one strip underneath or some other cool way? or should I change up the color and keep it where it is?        or any general i-think-this-would-be cool comments?      oh and I wont dye my whole head an unnatural color so plz dont suggest that.

I have caucasian hair that's pretty thick and straight, and I'm in the process of dreading my hair now. Since it's so naturally straight I have to use dread wax, therefore I cannot wash my scalp for a time period of about 2 to 3 months. Are there any negative long term effects that this could have on my scalp that would make it less naturally thick, more fine, etc, that would last past the time when I get rid of the dreads? I'm basically trying to look at the possibilities it will have on my natural hair afterwards.

So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?
