I would say to set goals for yourself. Have it in your mind that if you do not make it big by 24 (just an example), then move on. It can always be a hobby no matter what age. You really need a career to fall back on. There are so many aspiring singers out there that want to sing more than anything in the world. Maybe going to college and majoring in some music related field could be an option. That way you will have an education and career options if singing does not work out. Make sure you get your music out there though! Sing on youtube, audition, do local talent contest and shows. If it is your dream, go for it! If you do not make it big, at least you will always know in your heart that you tried. I wish you the best of luck!|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Believe it or not there are many many thousands of people who have very good voices but not one in a thousand is ever going to sing to a packed venue or have any fame and fortune. <br>  <br>  Also, as the 'talent' shows on tv graphically illustrate, there are loads of people whose 'talent' has been praised by family and friends since childhood who actually have no talent what so ever!<br>  <br>  <br>  Having a dream is fine, but it does not pay the rent.

A lot of actors/singers etc end up temping or waitressing to support them, as they don't make enough to live off of their passion.  You wouldn't get to sing in packed our venues to start with either, you'd have to work your way up.

Every MLS listing site or printout that I have ever seen has verbiage in it somewhere that indicates that the information is deemed to be correct but that buyers need to verify.  This releases everyone from being sued over honest mistakes and outright lies.  It puts the burden of truth on the buyer.

EjX9p9dBaa	As for your friend's return the first poster explained well why her<br>  return could be so high.  When a person can claim numerous tax deductions and credits their return increases dramatically.  <br>  <br>  There are numerous reasons why someone might get audited.  Each year the IRS "randomly" selects individuals and companies to get audited.  These are purely the same as throwing everyone who files a return name in a hat and drawing people.<br>  <br>  Other reasons are that someone files a return and something triggers a red flag.  Common items are when people try to claim a deduction for something you can't such, as a pet and yes people do try to claim their pet as a child.<br>  <br>  Other things the might trigger an audit is if the IRS determines that you are living far beyond your stated income.  An example is if the mortgage interest deduction from your home.  The IRS can get a good idea of what your monthly payment is based on this deduction, and can determine whether you make enough to make this payment and also have money to survive.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The IRS audits returns based on the odds that there is an error.<br>  <br>  Your friend got $6000 back suggesting she qualified for EIC and had income of around $15000.<br>  <br>  If she's out of school and made $15,000, she can't be claimed as a dependent and if her child lives with her, has the right to file as single, get EIC and the child tax credit.

If she was, her parents would claim both her and her baby.|`|AA10469473	Some audits are random, and others are because something looks out of the norm for similar returns.  It doesn't mean anything is wrong.  The person is asked to provide proof that what they filed is correct.

For instance, I had a client who wanted to use her name as her domain and I convinced her to choose massage-vegas.com instead.  She received good placement within 3 months and no advanced SEO was implemented.  She had new clients as a result shortly thereafter.  <br>  <br>  Of course, to achieve good placement this soon you also have to have good design skill.

It requires the second lowest down payment next to the VA Loan (which is only for the folks i mentioned above).<br>  <br>  Mortgage Insurance - there is an upfront fee of 1.5% for up front mortgage insurance, as well as a monthly fee of .5%, which is .5% of the total loan amount divided by 12.  This is still better than doing a conventional loan in my opinion.  You would be required to pay the monthly mortgage insurance for the first 5 years of the loan and that's it.  <br>  <br>  In order to be eligible for an FHA or any other type of loan, your middle credit score must be at or above 620.<br>  <br>  Pre-approval process:<br>  <br>  1 --- Complete a loan application with a local bank or national direct lender (do not use a broker)<br>  2 --- The lender will need to verify your income (they'll ask for your last two years' W2 Forms and a current work pay stub or 2)<br>  3 --- The lender will pull your credit (only once).  NOTE:  Each time your credit is pulled, 2 to 4 points are deducted from your credit scores.<br>  4 --- Credit report is reviewed and any additional loan application questions are answered.  Your file is run thru an automated underwriting system in an effort to generate a pre-approval.  The pre-approval is either faxed or scanned and emailed to you with the current date on it.<br>  <br>  Required down payment = 3.5% of the total loan amount<br>  You'll need to verify that you have these funds in the form of your last 2 to 3 monthly bank statements.<br>  <br>  Also, you can ask the sellers to pay your closing costs so you can avoid any additonal fees outside of the 3.5% mentioned above.  Remember, sellers are motivated these days, so this shouldn't be too hard.  And when I say that the sellers will pay your closing costs, it doesn't mean they pay them out of pocket.  You just deduct the closing costs from the agreed upon loan amount.<br>  <br>  EX:  So if you loan amount is $200,000, and closing costs are $5,000...<br>  <br>  ... if the seller agrees to seller assist, then the total loan amount is 200K - 5K = $195,000, and you will only be required to pay 3.5% as a down payment...<br>  <br>  ... if the seller does not agree, then the loan amount is $200K, and you'll need to bring $5,000 to the closing table + the 3.5% required down payment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your first goal should be to get pre-approved and then focus on making an offer on a home.  Pre-approvals should be valid for 120 days, and it should not cost you anything to get pre-approved.  <br>  Lastly, if you decide on a condo, it must be FHA approved.  To see a list of FHA approved condos, visit <a href="https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/condlook.cfm." rel="nofollow">https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/condlook...</a> <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

I'm pretty sure at 14 you can baby sit might be old not 100% on this<br>  And anything like that really.
kJ4g1vujaa	￡5000 of debt shouldn't be hard to tackle although your creditors aren't going to "defer" your debts.<br>  <br>  There actually was talk of a court order which would defer your debts for a year.  I'll see if that went through.  You also have the option of an administration order which is a court procedure which will roll your debts into one lower payment -  you can look them up on www.nationaldebtline.co.uk.<br>  <br>  You would have the option of bankruptcy - someone said the limit was ￡15000, it isn't.  You can actually go bankrupt for ￡750!  But for ￡5k and at your age there really is no point and it could affect your future career.<br>  <br>  So in order to reduce your outgoings and allow you to get to uni your options are probably debt management through a 3rd party company - plenty of those out there - do some mystery shopping and pick a good company - or tackle it yourself by offering reduced payments to your unsecured creditors.<br>  <br>  Council Tax is a priority debt and you must pay that first.  You Do Not want to meet a council tax bailiff.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	Council tax arrears are serious and could lead to prison if you don't pay them...you cant have these deferred,your student status wont protect you...it's unlikely that you'll be able to go on with this until your debts are sorted,go to the c.a.b....at the moment you may not get loans to pay for your course as your credit rating is so bad.creditors will not wait until you are ready to pay...sorry, it doesn't work like that|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	I am afraid debtors aren't allowed to have their debts deferred for 2 years. Maybe you can have some arrangment on the loans, but that will increase the interest on the loan. At the moment, there are 45,000 graduates out of work, so how can you say doing Uni will guarentee you a job?|`|86e0fcff22774bed26d5e5f6773ca754aa	If you owe Council Tax, they WILL get it out of you (they can even 'attach' your house so when you sell it part of the buyers payment goes direct to the Council).<br>  <br>  Other lenders are likley to be 'unsecured' .. these you can negotiate with .. I suggest you contact them and work something out  ...  ￡5,000 is not a lot .. you can't even go Bankrupt until you owe at least ￡15,000 ...|`|20lCgb6Uaa	Council tax has to be paid, but you could try to get your loans legally cancelled. Try www.bdebtfree.info and they will help you.|`|rLw3ThKmaa	Firstly move to Scotland where uni is free free free. Therfore theres no student loans to worry about.
AA11206283	No; You need to call Legal Aid.|`|EQtg2c72aa	Contact your local legal aid center. GL
AA10469473	Cutting your hourly pay is legal.  If you quit, you'd only get unemployment comp if the cut was very large.  If you decide to quit, line up another job first.|`|AA11966821	It's perfectly legal as long as they pay at least minimum wage, unless you have a written employment contract stipulating your pay rate and prohibiting changes during the term of that contract, or you are doing union work under a union contract.<br>  <br>  If you quit, you will not be eligible for unemployment.  And there are few jobs out there.  <br>  <br>  At least they did not terminate everyone and replace them with illegal aliens or foreign workers on employment visas.  There is a great deal of that going on these days, so if you are laid off and later discover you were replaced with either illegal alien or employment visa holder, file suit against them for discrimination on the basis of national origin (discrimination against US citizens).  <br>  <br>  That's all the options you have available to you: take it or leave & go elsewhere if you can find something.|`|paerqxfMaa	Contact your local Department of Labor -doesn't sound too legal to me.  So many employers are using this "economy" as a reason to screw their employees - it's just wrong.|`|AA10248966	call your state deparment of labor and speak to the labor standards office about all your concerns.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	As long as they don't cut your pay below the minimum wage, it's legal.
b6cPtJ6haa	We are in March, so I guess it is later in March.  I would not put it in, if I was an employer I would think that is kinda of odd.  It is close to when you start, so it is not a huge stretch but it is strange to put in future possibilities, resumes are supposed to be about actual life experiences that have happened, I would be annoyed if I was a hiring manager or worse thinking you were dishonest.  Unless it was some prestigious internship or future event that you had to qualify for, which I doubt, like being admitted to Harvard.<br>  However, if you did get an interview you can bring it up, if it is relevant to what you are interviewing for.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	No and No.<br>  <br>  You cannot pad your resume with something you haven't done yet.<br>  <br>  If you are going to have a time commitment that prevents you from fulfilling your schedule, you tell them.|`|AA10469473	No, you don't put anything on a resume that hasn't happened yet.|`|AA11429715	I think it is appropriate to put this commitment on a resume as long as you clearly indicate that it is a commitment but not an "achievement."  A prospective employer deserves to know of promises made which would limit the times you will be available for him.|`|AA10581224	The answer is no! Your resume is supposed to cover work you've already done.  If you put work you plan on doing you are lying on your resume.  Things change.  You may not end up volunteering there, after all.  Only put what you've done already.
rLP9wjPtaa	1. what is economically good for a 'country' is not always good for every member of said country, and not always good for other countries, environment, etc.<br>  <br>  2. politicians are not economists, and will often select policies that are more popular than best for the economy
Hx88UGlpaa	azred_tx  post is absolutely correct. If you still have utilities and are paying them, a bankruptcy filing won't matter at all. I filed last year, discharged in 02/08 and am a triple choice preferred customer with the phone company, preferred customer with my cable provider. As long as you continue to pay them and keep it in good standing your bankruptcy will not affect it at all. Good Luck!|`|Gun3UGzaaa	You should include your utility bills in the bankruptcy if any balance is owed.  The utility will close your account and reopen a new one for your post-bankruptcy life. You might need to pay a security deposit if those are permitted in your state.<br>  <br>  If the bankruptcy is approved, those balances will be discharged.  If the bkr is dismissed, the balances will be added back to your account.|`|BuvQ8tuuaa	A utility bill does not technically count as "debt" so filing bankruptcy won't have any effect on those bills whatsoever.  <br>  <br>  The only exception to this is if your utility provider has closed your account and sold your balance to a debt collector.  At that point, it *is* debt...but really isn't a utility bill anymore.
qBCGH52haa	Employment and income info, they will pull his credit reports, basically the same info they needed from you for the loan.
4RjM5lElaa	Say Hi, I'm  ____________ and I am starting work today.<br>  <br>  Smile at everyone you meet, make eye contact, offer a handshake and an introduction.  be prepared to tell a little about yourself.  Ask how long they have worked there, etc.<br>  <br>  Hopefully they will make you feel welcomed and help you reduce your jitters.<br>  <br>  be confident - you got the job, they wanted YOU - not the others, so prove to them that they made a right decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!
AA11573642	It is better that you renegotiate the deal with the state. It will be meaningless to leave a goverment job and losing 5000 simultaneously.|`|qBCGH52haa	Pay scales are usually tied to the job itself.  If the  job itself does not qualify for the higher ranked pay, then you will have little chance to get hired at your previous pay scale.  Call the HR department and ask what the highest rating for the job is.
yrza9o9Taa	yea of course you can and i recommend you do its faster good for your credit and you save money|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Most car loans don't have any prepay penalties so I would pay this sweet ride off as fast as you can and then straighten out your credit history so that you are not paying 20% in interest.|`|qBCGH52haa	Call the bank - ask them about pre-payment penalties.  As long as they say you will not be charged a penalty, go ahead and pay it off as fast as you can.  If there are penalties, ask what they are and if you would still save money, pay it off.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Yeah you can pay it off whenever you want....just beware of a prepayment penalty in your loan.  Also look to refinance in 1 year if you keep your credit up!
tADSxyqwaa	not by ;aw but a lot of insurance policies are "any driver over 25" so the company may not take on below that age|`|AA11249047	Most companies require that you be at least 21 because of the insurance
AA10469473	I'd call job 2 and tell them you have another offer but would prefer to work for them, and ask if there's any way they can let you know in a week or so rather than the 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  It's not really reasonable to expect job 1 to wait 3 weeks for your answer, but they'd probably be willing to wait for a week.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5016b43fb20cead76b97cdbb68c69858aa	I think you can contact job 2 to see if you can get your response earlier. My sister did that for a better paying job and because they really wanted her they sent her the letter of offer the same day.<br>  I don't think it's bad to explain to them that you really want to work for them and you have to let job 1 that you decline their offer asap so they can offer that job to someone else.
f3PMloJ3aa	Go To <br>  www.firstnewtown.com. <br>  They have a list companies offering work at home jobs, on their site|`|gIUdTXCAaa	When I started working from home I was the idiot that purchased every work at home program and found myself drowning! <br>  <br>  So since then I found a program called WA Its a learning center for internet marketers. It is a monthly subscription but very reasonable and definitely worth every penny. The information is great and they two owners actually coach you to success. <br>  <br>  If you like to read and write you can easily work at home with little up front costs. When I first joined WA the only thing I paid for was the membership fee and a domain name which was like 7 bucks or something close to that. They teach you how to take the free route and the paid route. So I started with the free techniques and once I made a profit used that to start the paid route. <br>  <br>  They offer you a ton of resources, tools and coaching. I highly recommend this program if you want to work from home. I have two small children and it's nice to be able to stay at home with them. I work a couple hours a day on the computer and then the rest of my time is spent with them.|`|a4dbe2b619975a35b28ada6eef78b518aa	I have tried many and this system seems to work for me.  Very honest group of people willing to help each other succeed.  The support you get is one on one via members website, email newsletter and my favorite; personal chat.  I owe my success because of this type of support. Try it and I will personally support you along the way.  Most systems out there are scams because people don’t know what to do to make an income after they sign up.  This has more support than any other.  Check out this link.
Gun3UGzaaa	Google the fair credit reporting act. Court judgements should be addressed there.  Normally it is 30 days from when they are notified that the satisfaction was done.  Sometimes the backlog is with the court.  You may need to check with them.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	My student loan was 7 years.
Gun3UGzaaa	Slow down and plan things.  You will need your benefits to cover the delivery.  I wouldn't tell your boss until you have some time to digest this and to make a plan.  If there are other women in your firm who are moms, see if you can meet with them privately and get their ideas.<br>  <br>  You will probably be able to get family leave and disability leave for at least 12 weeks after the baby's birth, so even if you are going to quit, don't do so before the baby's birth.  Even if another employer hired you, their benefits might exclude pregnancy as a preexisting condition.<br>  <br>  Get a checkup with your doctor and see what you need to do to be healthy.  Follow her advice.  If you cannot travel, look into accomodations under the americans with disabilities act.  You might find you can do much of your work at home or at a local office.<br>  <br>  Map out your schedule nine months from now, and see if there is any big deadline (such as a client's annual report or 10-K filing) that will need to be handled by someone else.  When you meet with your boss, you want to have a plan in hand to discuss with her/him.  <br>  <br>  Have you considered having your husband stay home and be primary care giver?<br>  <br>  When you talk with your boss, focus on how much you like the employer, and how valuable your skills are.  If you take a few months' off to get used to your new role as mom, and otherwise return to work, they will be grateful for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11966821	If you are traveling 100% of the time, are you doing field audits for clients of you accounting firm or for branch offices/subsidiaries of a parent company?  If that's what your job is, no telecommuting.  Your job requires you to travel and that's that.  Either transfer to another job assignment, if possible, or continue in your traveling job, or quit and see if there's anything else available.  Anything to do with finance and accounting is a glutted market and jobs are pretty hard to find.<br>  <br>  If you want to try to transfer to another job assignment within your current company, put out some feelers with your boss before mentioning you are pg.  If transfer or different job assignment is not possible, you will have to decide to keep what you have or quit & find something else.<br>  <br>  How much of your 6-figure salary have you two been socking away in preparation for starting a family?  Sounds from your question like you did not plan things very well, financially or otherwise, in advance.  Get your own financial house in order in a big hurry.|`|jZXFHma7aa	One of my friends was in a similar situation. Her husband took two years off to stay home with the baby so she could go back to work. She makes six figures with excellent benefits & insurance so it was the only option. He is an a/c tech so he just quit his job & became a stay at home dad. and he loved it! If you and your hubby really want this child, you'll make it work. Keep your job, take your maternity leave then go back to work to provide for your family and your hubby can stay home for a while.|`|diOREIPAaa	Can you do your work from home? Skype is a good way to attend meetings. You can also hire a nanny to help at home, and cook the meals. It all comes down to what is suitable for your family, and can your job let you telecommute. It would be less expensive for their sake, no more airline tickets, or hotels, or per diem account. Let me know what you decided..its a great question, and a hard decision to make.

7Uzgox5Iaa	Hello <br>  <br>  I know there are tons of jobs online and a lot of them are scams. I can tell you that i have been working online for about 9 months doing some data entry stuff  and i can tell you that i have tried lots of these jobs online at first. The 1 that i have been working with trade trends it is a marketplace for data entry work you can pick between various types of jobs fro some big companies who need people everyday. It's a great site to visit and at least have a look. visit www.dataentrycareers.info this site has been on t.v and news. It's the best one by far in my experience. You can make some good money to.

You just write a letter at the end of the tax year to your tax office, setting out your claim. HMRC may ask why your employer is not reimbursing you for this.|`|b6d3a49665ad92bb5d476df25101106baa	The authorised mileage amount with HMRC is 40p for the first 10,000 miles and then 25p for all mileage above 10,000.<br>  <br>  If you receive more than 40p for first 10,000 and 25p for rest then this amount is classed as taxable expenses and you will receive a P11D (Benefits & expenses form) at the end of the tax year.<br>  <br>  If you receive under these amounts then your claim the difference from the tax office after the tax year ends via a P87 (Expenses claim form) if you work for an employer (PAYE) which it sounds like you do. A letter is unlikely to provide the info required.<br>  <br>  You can claim for all mileage to temporary work places therefore if you go straight from home to a temporary workplace you can claim. If you go to a main office and then onto your temporary locations you can only claim from the main office.<br>  <br>  You must keep records of your mileage, destinations and departure points as these should be requested for your first claim, estimates can be rejected.

KdFXk0ajaa	Because they are clueless. When I was initially establishing my credit at age 17-21 while in the USAF I did pay minimal interest on a credit card. Store and gas credit cards were the norm. There weren't 100,000 issuers of Visa/MasterCards back then. So a guy I knew who worked at Accounting and Finance at the base told me to get a Sears card and use it for small purchases like to buy oil & filter to do an oil change on my car. As he instructed me I made small purchases every month for a few months and paid the balance off each month. Then I bought something for a little over $100 and paid that balance of in 4 months which demonstrated my ability to pay on an ongoing basis. Then a got a car loan through the credit union and paid that on time. Years later came the Visa, MasterCard, Amex. and then the mortgage and many more car notes. I own my home, my 2008 Sonata and everything else I own free and clear. I have a solid amount of money stowed in the credit union. The problem I see with people these days is the DESIRE for the best, newest, greatest whatever regardless of the cost, and their ability to pay.<br>  The answer to your question was the first line of this answer. Bottom line is "some people just DON'T THINK"!|`|7B9a65xaaa	FICO want to see people use their credit cards. On your credit report under each account is a "DATE OF LAST ACTIVITY", some people mistakenly think that if you pay your credit card off in full it won't show up as using your credit. If you use your card every month and pay if off every month in full then your date of last activity will always be the previous month. Not using your cards in the last 6 months will cause FICO not to factor in that accounts good history.

ePkiOzPSaa	Possibly... but they could also help people who can afford a house but for whom it would take a long time to save up a downpayment.  Some people move from renting to buying a home and end up paying less on their mortgage than they did for their rent, so why shouldn't they be able to afford that house?<br>  <br>  To be honest, there's really nothing wrong with the theory of no downpayment loans.  If a person can afford all the mortgage payments, why should they have to save up a down?  What if they have saved up 15%, so they have enough for the FHA and closing and a decent savings after, but they aren't quite there for putting down the regular 20% (which means having much more than 20% actually available)?<br>  <br>  Why should people be allowed loans of hundreds and thousands of dollars just because they have 50 grand to put down?  Does that automatically mean that they will be able to pay off all that other money?  No, they are just as able to come into hardships and be at risk to lose their home.<br>  <br>  Granted, this practice harms the banks more, when the buyers bankrupt before building up any appreciable equity.<br>  <br>  It's the people who default that make you look down on these programs.  These can absolutely be helpful, especially for first time home buyers who end up wasting lots on rent that could have been spent on a mortgage because they need to live somewhere but can't afford a downpayment.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	You are absolutely correct, if you can't afford the down payment and closing costs, then you shouldn't be buying a home. Suze Orman would tell you that if you don't have at least 6 months of payments over and above what it costs you to get into the home in some reserves, then you aren't capable financially of affording a home either.

Can you sell an idea to anyone?  Then go into advertising or marketing.  Are you creative but like to hang behind the scenes?  Being a TV camera man might be just the thing for you.  How about writing?  There are lots of communications positions with Web-based publications, magazines, ad agencies, newspapers, you name it!  Build on your strengths and what you really like to do.  As they say, if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.  You have lots of time to decide. Good luck.
49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Yeah, eBay is no longer the way forwards.<br>  <br>  I have bought a few things in the past, but I have always been really disappointed with the quality of the items that I've received.  It's too much effort to return things.  Just this afternoon I was bored at work but knew that I wanted to purchase a new pair of shoes so I logged onto eBay to see if there was anything I wanted ... and then remembered how the stuff I'd always bought from there in the past had been rubbish so decided to just shop online at a regular retail store, where I'd undoubtedly pay a higher price but I'd be assured of what quality I'd be getting.<br>  <br>  I recently considered using it for baby equipment, as I have a baby on the way and can't afford brand new stuff for larger items such as prams ... but then decided that it makes far more sense to use local papers and Loot, or localised websites such as Gumtree, so that I could actually view items before purchasing them.<br>  <br>  Also, many many years ago I used it to source DVDs and CDs from the US that weren't available easily in the UK.  I no longer need to do this as it's easy enough to acquire these products through a variety of other means, whether that be online or off-line.<br>  <br>  eBay have recently reported in the news that their profits have been falling (I believe this is the first time in their ten year history) so clearly you're not going to be the only one feeling the pinch.  Whilst they have attributed this to the overall economic situation, I can't help but disagree - that's only *part* of the problem.  Another large problem is that consumers simply don't want to use eBay anymore because you can't be assured of what you're getting or for a variety of other reasons, so I think they're going to see a continued decline.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Think its the credit crunch,my items dont sell as quickly as they used to....|`|kykmpr0Caa	its the same with everything including the high street, unless people desperately need something they cannot afford to buy it just because they like it. ebay is no exception to the rule or the crisis of the recession. try offering cheaper or free postage for a week or so see if you can get some buyers|`|Z9oDWMP3aa	I used to buy regularlly from ebay but the quality of the stuff is so varied that you never know what your going to get and its too much hassle to return.

The reason being it used to be straightforward but I really have noticed an increase in the number of people who won't pay for items/don't pay til it suits them/take ages to post an item leaving me waiting for it for ages and a bit of a culture of being held to ransom over fear of negative feedback. All that in mind I avoid using so much now to buy or sell.<br>  <br>  Also I can imagine with the number of redundancies and recession that people don't have as much money to spend at the moment and aren't willing to pay as much for items as they used to.|`|YDXvFi1Naa	I do buy on a regular basis bur right now the only things that I am getting are the real absolute necessities.

Good Luck|`|4JapQjRnaa	People like me are tired of paying more to sell and get less on eBay.<br>  <br>  I do not buy anything or sell anything on eBay anymore. Because of the multiple ways to pay for an item once it sells I wasn't making as much as I could have. So I started my own auction website with the goal in mind to let the seller walk a way with more in their pocket then with less. The only charge I bill is posting fees, there are no added charges like per item percentage charges, no third party charges, from my end it's just the posting fees and I am looking for SELLERS.<br>  <br>  If interested the site address is: www.Ooo-Ah-Auctions.com Buyer and Seller must be 21 years old or older to buy or sell. I advertise the site as being an "Adult Website without the Porn." And "We're not like eBay, we're Better." <br>  <br>  It is brand new, I am adding affiliates, but need sellers more importantly. I know you are with eBay now and congratulations for sticking it out so long and making money doing so, but People like me are tired of paying more to sell and get less on eBay.<br>  <br>  Does this answer your question?<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  John Edwards CEO Www.Ooo-Ah-Auctions.com
ot1ZZexeaa	In my area they make anywhere from minimum wage to 15.00 per hour. It's not exactly a fatty job. Most don't even require any training. I had a job like this while I was finishing graduate school. The funny thing was there was another girl who had attending some school for the job and she made minimum wage and I made about 17 bucks a hour and I had no experience in medical offices and I hadn't gone to the rip off school she attended.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	30,000 to 32,000|`|gxL9qeTyaa	I am taking online classes for 3 different courses.

My past bosses were very much into firing people, if they were in a bad mood.  It just seems to make some bosses feel better/superior, to fire workers.  My advice:  Whenever possible, stay away from the boss, until they calm down.  This way, you have a 50/50 shot, of keeping your job.|`|bdzG1VEDaa	There is nothing you can do but bear with it... I have the same sometimes, then I have to tiptoe around him as well until he gets into a better mood. It sucks! Just try to do your job as best you can so he won't start picking on you too...
dd8064abbae26533619e0de7adc3a9d8aa	A college degree does make a difference.  Any employer would appreciate that you are educated.  But what sometimes happens is that students finish college too soon out of necessity to not pay for another year of college.  And they're not ready for a career.  I studied to be a music teacher, and now I'm an accountant.  I'm sure you'll find something that you're good at and be successful.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	While being a teacher is an admirable profession, if it isn't for you, then don't do it. <br>  <br>  You're concerned about not having "any other qualification".  Baloney.  You will be a college graduate.  That opens the doors to numerous opportunities -- talk to advisors in your career placement center.<br>  <br>  As to informing your friends and family, why are you allowing their expectations of what you should be dictate your life or your feelings about life?  You need to figure out what you want to do -- not what others want you to do, or what others say you should do.
PTJmmtPjaa	AIG will be around for a while....at least until the government slowly dwindles their assets to get paid back. With that being said, how can one expect that the stock will ever clinb in valuation.....unless the stock market experiences a strong bull run. I mean, the givernement is first in line to get paid, and by forcing AIG to sell their assets....will not produce any short term gain.

AcgDcQG0aa	Yes, the decay is real.  But with these leveraged ETFs you get so much volatility that you can easily end up with a margin call that you can't cover.  Because in the short-term, these funds can go up several hundred percent.<br>  <br>  And if you short equally both Bull and Bear funds at the same time.  Then you can still end up with a margin call.  Because your investment positions will become unequal as one fund increases in price while the other declines.<br>  <br>  You can keep rebalancing your positions to keep them both equal.  But such rebalancing will increase your trading costs.  And I'm not sure that you can still make money if you keep rebalancing like that.  Because you will have to keep adding to your loosing positions and taking away from your winning positions.<br>  <br>  It's something you need to calculate and see if you can make money when you keep rebalancing your positions to keep them equal.

Saul1Bhuaa	You always have to file personal tax returns.  If your business is a sole proprietorship, then you are your business.  Consequently, you'll have only one tax return to file -- personal.|`|tqfkHiEQaa	You do file for yourself (personal) and your business. It's not as hard as it seams though. You can use a site like www.turbotax.com that will handle both of them easily for you.|`|NzuV7dQLaa	Contact your nearest office of Internal Revenue Service - Taxpayer Assistance Division. Not only can they answer your questions,but they also have free literature on the subject.|`|HVeSDUmYaa	Quarterly tax returns are not filed for Sole Proprietors, which you can be.  You may have to Pay quarterly estimated self-employment taxes, but usually not in your first year of operation when you could have a loss.  But you don't actually file anything. Also, you do not usually know what your sales will be.  Come tax time you would file a Schedule C "Profit or Loss from Business" along with your 1040.  I suggest you check out the irs and read their info on small business.  www.irs.gov

If it has gone up in value, you will owe 15% capital gains tax when you report the sale on your tax return.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	You need to talk to a CPA or tax accountant who works with the IRS in cross boarder transactions.  You will not be taxed on the deposit, but you may owe income taxes on the sale...you may also owe taxes in Mexico.  Depending on the amount of money, it could become very complicated very quickly if you don't handle it correctly from the beginning.<br>  <br>  Almost all cash transactions are now reported to the IRS (by the banking system), so having all of your ducks in a row is important.|`|Jgg7ZTItaa	v b is correct, what you are taxed on is the amount over and above what you paid for the property, or in this case the value of the land when you inherited it.  The bank is required to report large amounts of cash deposits.  This is done to track illegal activities and not necessarily tax purposes.|`|UlwfBS34aa	it varies by bank. I think standard is anything over a $5000 deposit is automatically reported to the irs. So just make a few deposits of $4999 at different times instead of all of your money all at once
58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	It's extremely important from a Human Resources point of view.  During that orientation period you usually would be asked to sign a copy of to employee handbook, the company's internet usage policy, dress code, etc.  As far as the company goes, they are then able to say that they have informed you of all these things, so if you do anything wrong, they have documentation that you had been informed of the rules and will have a good reason to fire you.
2RQ4qDhXaa	The short answer is no - you are going to need to be in the 740 range for FHA-grade programs and at least 720 for non-conforming loans.<br>  <br>  However, if you convert the home into a daycare first, you may be able to consider that a mixed-usage business and get a primary mortgage loan on the new house. You simply have to show that you (and not someone else) would be living in the new home. That can be a bit of a hard sell to the mortgage company, but if you can work with them and prove it's going to be your primary you may be able to get a mortgage based on that.<br>  <br>  Does your city allow a single-family residence to be converted into a multi-use property? You may have to file paperwork with the City before you can make a home into a business if you don't intend to live there. Some city and county codes require a filing, and some don't. You need to check in your area before you make any decisions.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend talking to a professional before making any decisions - someone who would know what's involved with a home-to-business conversion - before starting that project.<br>  <br>  If you can get the new home listed as a primary residence mortgage, you MAY qualify, but 720 would be a lot easier.
yGAPvstLaa	No they will not run a credit check for a loan modification because it is based on what you can afford not your credit score. You may have to list your debts however so they can come up with a plan to get back on track. The pre-qualification just means that any collection activity including foreclosure has been suspended to give you time to payback your back payments. Just be honest with the bank about your income because if you do not get current and break the plan they can go ahead and take your house.|`|oojO4WAraa	They should.  That would be important information to consider.|`|JzAMcMzlaa	Simply anything that you sign that deals with money.. almos every thing will go through a credit check. Its sucks yes.. but hey..they have to get their money somehow right?|`|2RQ4qDhXaa	Most of the time if they hold your mortgage they have access to your credit anyway - they do what's called a "soft pull" of credit every month or every quarter (depending on the mortgage holder). This does not hurt your credit and does not give full details, just a basic public-record credit summary.<br>  <br>  Because of that, they don't usually pull a full credit report for a modification. <br>  <br>  But even if they do, it's not weighted as heavily as when you are applying for a new mortgage - they figure if you can't make your mortgage payment under the current agreement, you are probably falling behind on other bills as well.<br>  <br>  If they told you they won't pull credit - in writing! - then they won't pull.
WVAd2l7Xaa	I worked a till once. It's actually very simple. Essentially, you push a button (confirming the order price) and the till automatically opens.<br>  <br>  Again, it's very simply and shouldn't take more than 30min (from my experiences) to fully understand all the options and such when it comes to purchases. They'll train you, so it should be very low stress.|`|cDETflFmaa	I've trained many people on how to work a cash register - some learn faster than others but everyone gets the hang of it. They aren't as complicated as they look, and they're hard to mess up.

5203612d842a45744262b29372d343b3aa	It sounds like you received a check from the previous employer and took it to your bank and deposited it into an IRA. If you did this within 60 days of having received the check you won't have to pay tax on that amount.<br>  The problem here is that the previous employer should have withheld 20% for federal taxes if they sent you the check. If you did not put this amount into the IRA you would have to pay tax and perhaps early withdrawal penalty on that amount. The amount withheld can be shown as a tax payment on your tax return.<br>  When you show the amount on the form sent to you on your tax return you enter the amount on line 16a and put none on line 16b. Attach a note that the amount was rolled over into an IRA.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If you did a direct transfer to an IRA, then you won't have to pay taxes on it and you shouldn't have to report anything. <br>  <br>  If you did an indirect transfer where you actually took the money, then made a deposit into an IRA, then you would have to declare the income and take the income back out by taking the IRA deduction. <br>  <br>  The statement that your previous company sent you, is it an official tax form, probably a 1099 form? It shouldn't be if you did a direct transfer. If its not an official IRS tax form, but rather just a year end statement for informational purposes, then there's no need to report it on your taxes. If it is in fact an official tax form, then you should talk to a tax pro about how to handle it.
49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Not sure what the person above is on about with HSBC being an online bank ... erm, try walking down any high street in the country and I'm sure you'll find a branch.  It is not solely an online bank.<br>  <br>  With a normal bank account, here's how it works ...<br>  <br>  You can deposit money in a variety of ways:<br>  - Online as a transfer from another account<br>  - Paying in cash or a cheque, in person, at any branch<br>  <br>  The main way to withdraw money would be at a cashpoint using your card.  I don't believe that HSBC allow over-the-counter withdrawals anymore for security reasons.  You could also make payments online from your account.<br>  <br>  Now, some savings accounts work a little bit differently.  You still pay money in the same, but there are restrictions on how you can take money out and how often.  If you plan to make a lot of withdrawals, then a savings account might not be your best option, but that said, I have no idea what products they offer 15-year-olds and it might be that that is all you can get.<br>  <br>  When you go to uni, there are specific student accounts that will be a much better option for you, as they'll usually have no fees or anything.  If you go to one of the really big unis, usually representatives from the bank will come to your campus during orientation week and set up a stall or something and try to get you to join up with them.  Even if they don't come to your campus, then they'll usually have incentives for you to join - like I believe NatWest was giving away free Young Person's Railcards last September if you opened an account, and I think someone else was doing iTunes vouchers.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	HSBC is an online bank.  Generally you would be transferring money in and out of the HSBC account using an electronic transfer form a local bank.  You could mail them in a check and use their ATM card for withdrawals.Their savings interest rates are higher than most local banks but I since you are a student I suspect you will not have much money on deposit so the higher interest rates will amount to pennies per year.  You would probably be better off opening a free checking account near your university with free ATM access.<br>  <br>  Cari:  I'm not on anything.  You must have missed the "via their website"  HSBC online bank account does not give you access to a branch.  You would need a separate account for teller services.   HSBC only has branches in about 10 states which is why Monica probably opened an online account to begin with.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	I vote for Tesco!  Some of their own-brand products are just ridiculously cheap (e.g. 11p for a can of baked beans) but they're all of a decent quality.  The packaging might be ugly, but when the food is on your plate you can't tell that it was part of their budget range.<br>  <br>  Sainsbury's is undoubtedly the most expensive of the four ... although I believe they have some good products and occassionally I don't mind spending a bit more for them.<br>  <br>  Morrison's couldn't be worse value ... their own brand products are their cheapest products as is the case in most supermarkets, but at Morrison's they're simply inedible.  Therefore you're forced to pay more for branded items.  Also, their customer service is rubbish and queue times at the till can often average half an hour at my local ... think what else I could be doing in that time!<br>  <br>  I can't comment on Asda because, despite the fact that I've lived in six different areas in the past five years, I've never had as Asda nearby (and I live in central London, not some back-of-beyond place).  I don't drive, so for me to go to Asda would be exceptionally poor value for money since I'd have to get two buses there and a taxi back (couldn't do two buses with all my shopping!).|`|LV8uUmehaa	I'm getting bored at Tesco, my family member (I'm too young to shop) shops there and It's the same things, since we have a small Tesco branch near us. <br>  <br>  When I get older I'm going to go to Sainsburys, I think the food is nice there.<br>  <br>  (Not in your list, but Marks and Spencer is actaully yum).|`|EnMB5V7eaa	Whole Foods. <br>  <br>  You get what you pay for.

KpcjvUgwaa	A restaurant is a good idea. <br>  <br>  Here are some very important things I've learned from my 15 years in marketing and my 6 years in restaurant/retail management.<br>  <br>  Never understaff your facility during slow shifts...A rush can come at any moment...if you don't have enough people to maintain a fast, efficient and thorough service, then that bad experience is going to be talked about to plenty of people when those folks go out the door.<br>  <br>  Keep your people busy by cleaning and other projects...you can never be too clean..never.<br>  <br>  Use extrememly large dinking glasses...sodapop costs you nearly nothing don't worry about wasting it. Make sure your patrons have plenty to drink, so they don't feel like they have to ration their beverage simply because they don't know if/when the server will show up to refill it. Never assume your severs are that efficient, because they aren't.<br>  <br>  buy 10 get 1 free "Customer Cards" don't work. 10 is way too much to ask of your patrons, and gives them no incentive to hurry through the 10 punches..that is if they don't lose the card first.<br>  <br>  3 to 1 is the most effective ratio ...If all they have to do is buy 3 and get the 4th free ( or aggressively discounted) that is a goal which can be achieved easily and within reason, so it will happen fast...and that is your goal...to get them to cycle back through your doors at a faster pace than would have happened naturally. You aren't losing any money, you are actually increasing your net revenue because you've created sales where they don't otherwise exist.<br>  <br>  Cleaning off the tables and setting it up for the next patron quickly ( and by that I mean instantly) will increase your daily profits measurably.<br>  The reason is, by doing this it allows you to sit and serve more tables during a 10 hour period. If you can increase the number of tables served per day by just 5, thats another $3000 profit in a month ( based on $15 per table)....and that is the salary for 3 more employees.<br>  <br>  Your patronage volume will also increase as people realize they can eat at your place, get served quickly....and also your lines during rush hours don't last very long.<br>  <br>  The amount of business lost due to people getting up and leaving, or walking in and seeing a crown, then turnong around...is staggering.<br>  <br>  Put systems in place to get food prepared quickly, and tables cleared instantly.<br>  <br>  Direct Mail will be your best friend...people respond to offers for food more than anything else.....and they will respond over and over....it is another method to get that once a month guy, back through your doors 2 or 3 extra times. Especially if you ask your customers what their favorite menu items are ( now you have a hook, for specific customers)<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask your customers often what they like an ddon't like about...anything about your company. This is something that business owners fear doing...but it is vital information if you want to grow, and customers will be loyal to you for your efforts.<br>  <br>  Look for oportunities for other businesses to benefit from your product. If they want to put coupons to your establishment on their promo material...LET THEM. It ads value to what they are doing, and now their traffic becomes your traffic.<br>  <br>  Finally, and most importantly....train your people to understand that even though they might be "Customer Service" people..they are actually in the marketing business. Marketing is the science of making and keeping customers..and "Marketing" is happening at every point anything from your company touches a customer...that means people...attitudes....product....service... your policies. Everything must work to increase your ability to make and keep customers.<br>  <br>  If you have people that just don't understand this...get rid of them instantly.  Customers can and do continue to influence others months and years afterward.  <br>  <br>  Go for your dream and good luck.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Watch a few episodes of Kitchen Nightmares.<br>  Gordon Ramsay is a multimillionaire and owns several posh restaurants across the globe, however, most of the people he helps are several hundred thousand dollars in debt because of their failing restaurants.<br>  <br>  I have frequently heard that about 10% of all attempted restaurants succeed past the first year or so. <br>  <br>  You need to be sure that you have a good location, a good concept, good food, good prices, and a nice dining room.  <br>  <br>  It is possible to make money, but it will take at least a few years before you end up with a million bucks off it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|W5E8GhiBaa	That all depends on your restaurant and how busy it is. By owning just one restaurant it's gonna take along time to get to a million. First you need to open it, which will run at least 500k, that should cover the building, materials, and the whole bang, unless you want something fancy. Something like a chilis or applebees cost about 2million to open. Then you need to pay your employees, licenses every year.  The only income you see is the meal prices, and catering if you choose to do so. It would take a lot of hard work and time. Unless you get a chain going, you know more than one restaurant, it will be  along time before you see a million dollars.
2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	what is the new title for a person who researches a given subject, then reports findings, normally in terms of a written report?<br>  <br>  <br>  Google<br>  <br>  Not to be sarcastic, but a lot of those jobs have gone away, due to Google.  They just don't exist anymore. That's probably the root of your problem. You could still go for "research assistant", it's just that you're the only one. (In academia they are sometimes called "graduate assistants" I think.)  You might want to go with "researcher". <br>  <br>  The closest job  I know to your definition are in the intelligence community and they call their people Analysts. It isn't quite the same thing, as these people are also subject matter experts. For example a South Asia Analyst would probably have a degree (often an M.A.) in something like "Asian Studies", (back in the day I was going after a "Russian Studies" degree for a while).  They would however produce written reports on assigned topics within their specific area of knowledge, so they fit your definition in that respect.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
ecg3Zeh6aa	1) Suspending short-sales diminishes liquidity and transparency in the market. <br>  2) Since the market is not "worthless", everybody isn't engaged in short-selling.<br>  3) Suspending short-sales doesn't make bad companies better. <br>  4) Suspending short-sales prolongs bad situations instead of making them go away. Is it better to die quickly by guillotine or slowly from cancer?

You do really need to be patient with people, and expect to meet people who think you can do more than you are able to. I used to feel really out of place in the placements, as I wasn;t confident just like you said you are. But with time, you gain more knowledge and therefore, more confidence. And for the time that I studied it, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. A lot of things are common sense related. I enjoyed the time I spent doing nursing, hence why Im going back this year. if you think you are right for it, go for it, give it a go. :)
NcFWcO3Laa	Since you are in foreclosure I would get an attorney.  Sounds like you have tried to work out the problem but this is to important of a problem to work out on your own at this point.   If you have made every payment in a timely manner and have the paper trail to prove it I'm sure that you will be ok.  At the same time it sounds like your lender is so messed up they need  a little prodding to get this situation resolved.<br>  <br>  I had a similar problem when my lender failed to credit an additional payment.  It took them three months and I had to mail or fax them copies of my canceled checks showing my payment history 3  or 4 times before they finally figured out that they had screwed up.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	After all of this and you where unable to complete i have only one thing for you to do.<br>  Call a Real Estate attorney that will do a loan modification.

Maybe you could call your local HUD office and ask them for advice just to find someone who can help with a mortgage company. Look for free resources if at all possible. Maybe your county or state organizations.

dPLkNRNuaa	The insurance company is not required to renew your policy.<br>  <br>  As long as you had insurance on the day of the fire, that claim is covered. Your claim is handled the same if you renew your policies for the next 50 years or if you cancel the day after the fire. All the insurance company cares about there is that you had coverage on the date/time of the fire.<br>  <br>  Your mother may have had only 2 small claims in 50 years....until she had a very bad house fire followed by 2 burglary claims. At this point, the insurance company has paid out more on claims then they collected in 50 years of premium. They are cutting their losses and going to let someone else assume the risk of insuring this property. <br>  <br>  All you can do is keep talking to insurance companies until you find one willing to insure you. However, with a bad house fire and 2 burglary claims, it's going to be expensive. You will probably pay a good bit more for insurance post fire than you did before.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	There is often insurance through the state for high-risk policies.

B6EVKaFPaa	The first thing you need to decide is whether you're looking for a job or a business.<br>  <br>  There are several "jobs" out there but unless you manage to find a telecommuting job with a company, the jobs don't pay too well. Most of the work you do will be dependent upon what work is available. Jobs such as ChaCha, can be a lot of fun, but again--limited in the amount of money you can earn.<br>  <br>  A business can possibly have better income, but it all depends on you. The amount of income you earn will be dependent on you and not what work is available. Most of the companies will have a fee to pay for the starter kit. The cost can range. Some companies require inventory, so the starter kit is higher. I joined Scentsy and am having a great time with them. The starter kit for them was only $99.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to follow your passion. If you're doing something you love, then it is definitely worth it.

Each of the team members had to pick a competing radio station and learn about them, their programing, demographics, advertising customers, etc. To answer your question by using my examples, you will need to do the same thing within your market-niche. At the same time you will need to discover why your business among others will stand out, what will make you successfully different?  Pricing? Customer Service? Both?<br>  <br>  2. Do you need to be license? Generally speaking, yes you will need a business license so the city can tax you.<br>  <br>  3. Do you need to be incorporated if so how ? Legal Zoom.com is where I would send you to get the legal paper work in becoming incorporated. [1] <br>  <br>  Do you need to be, consider these mentions from <br>  www.companiesinc.com [2]<br>  <br>  Liability Protection, Tax Savings, Business Credibility, Ease of Raising Capital, Prestige for the Corporate Officers, Perpetual Duration, Simple Transfer of Ownership, Centralized Management, and Privacy (The “Corporate Veil”). You can go to www.companiesinc.com to learn more about there resources. <br>  <br>  4) What type of insurance or coverage protection do you need? If you have home owners insurance there maybe coverage there, but the best one to ask would be you insurance agent.<br>  <br>  5) What is the best way to advertise? Know your market, know and hit hard your demographics. Punctuate pricing and customer service, make it a point to stand out from the rest.<br>  <br>  In a previous reply I made these suggestions. From my Book<br>  <br>  Pinch You Way to Success (still being written),<br>  <br>  Do all you can on your own first. Market research, Demographic research, where is your market place niche .

To have them printed 40 count on colored card stock paper ($5.00).<br>  <br>  Apply decal's on your car or truck. <br>  <br>  In your town you may have seen people advertising for others or themselves using a "sandwich" board, (two boards hinged together with a cut-out in the middle to be worn over the shoulders). Generally speaking you want to do the same thing covering your small business with no or not much start up money.<br>  <br>  You have to constantly be thinking out side the box, just to stay ahead of yourself.<br>  <br>  Take a Part to very Part time job to help pay for some of these things.<br>  <br>  At Www.Ooo-Ah-Auctions.com, I am doing the same things I am suggesting you do. Nearly two months ago I was laid off of work, barley scraping by on my UEI, I put that money to cover housing. But, I also teach music/guitar, earning $50.00 bucks a week. With that I buy food for myself and apply the rest somehow to my business idea and gas. <br>  <br>  So far I have been able to advertise, (Free - $5.00), purchase the website decal for one of my cars ($35.00) . I bought the my domain name ($10.00), have gotten online, (Hosting fees at $35.00 Per month), and am now pricing the same sort of decals for my other car.<br>  <br>  Before my lay off I refinanced a small loan that I had and with a little cash in my pocket I purchased an auction script that allows my website to function, ($100.00). <br>  <br>  Even if you have to pinch your way to success, you can still make it. Set your priorities, go without. If I don't get a job soon I'll have to cut my cable TV and maybe phone, I can't afford it, I do not want the added weight of owing the company money I do not have just to either pay them back later or get a negative mention on my credit score.<br>  <br>  Where is your niche?<br>  <br>  "Niche market ventures may become profitable even though they are by nature small in comparison to the mainstream marketplace, or monopoly; due to the benefits of specialization and focus on small identifiable market segments; even without the benefit of economy of scale. Niche markets may be ignored or discounted by large businesses due to what they consider to be small potential; this in turn is part of the process that makes the niche market available to smaller businesses. The key to capitalizing on a niche market is to find or develop a market niche that has customers who are accessible, that is growing fast enough, and that is not owned by one established vendor already."

You may want to adjust your thinking just a little bit here and go with vinyl/decal type signs like I did.

To be in compliance with your state and city regulations, this is an important step. You will want to check your local and state rules, but you may also need to register a Fictitious Name or DBA if you are a sole proprietor. <br>  <br>   Advertise your business.  Advertise your services by passing out flyers and making cold calls to businesses  targeted as good prospects. These might include property managers of apartment complexes and business parks.<br>  <br>   Offer an incentive.  Offer a first time free cleaning service. You could also offer a discounted rate or a coupon special. <br>  <br>   Offer some specific services .  Offer to prepare vacant apartments for new tenants.<br>  <br>   Get attention with something unique.  Chose a business name that would make your business stand out because “it’s very hard to get business.

3ixmHSwmaa	Hopefully you'll get an answer from someone in the lending business, but meanwhile, it's unlikely you will find a conventional lender willing to make the loan you are looking for. The reason risky loans were made in the past is because lenders could always trust that the value of the real estate would go up. If you defaulted on your loan, they could always forclose and sell the house to recapture all their principal. These days, it's pretty hard to sell a house, so lenders are looking very carefully at the borrower's track record. You have become an important factor in the value of the loan.<br>  <br>  You might find private money out there from someone willing to take big risks, but with big risk comes big reward. In other words, you will have to pay a high interest rate. Even in this case you will likely need a big down payment too.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could find someone willing to let you assume their loan. Not sure this is an option these days because things have changed so dramatically in the past few years, but they used to call it an AITD (All Inclusive Trust Deed.)

I got through high school and a 2 yr degree, but stopped going after that. I am now middle aged and realize how dumb that decision was. I have gone back to university and am working my way towards a bachelors degree. Please do not make this decision. You are going down the wrong road. You will regret it the rest of your life. As for selling stuff on craigslist sure you can do that for extra cash. What happens when you don't have anything else to sell and do not make enough money to support yourself.

You can earn ￡6035 before paying tax, although you should add in wages you earned from 6th April last to the time you ceased employment to calculate your liability. If you are due a repayment, you will get it when your Tax Return is processed. If any further tax is due, you will be asked to pay it by 31st January next. There is no liaison between tax liability and benefits, so your entitlement to childcare vouchers will not be affected, and by then you won't be registered as self-employed, anyway.|`|at3fTytsaa	The person you spoke to is correct. You dont inform HMRC that your business has ceased by phone or letter, you do it through your self assessment. After 6 April, you will be sent your self assessment for the year ended 5/4/09. You will include in this your income and expenditure account for the period up to when your business ceased. There will also be abox on the form for you to enter the date your business ceased. You will then calculate the tax due to the end of your self employment, which you should already have paid on account. HMRC will then sort out whether a refund is due or whether you have more tax to pay - without knowing what you have already paid and when your year end is I cannot advise on this.<br>  You can cancel your DD for your NIC's.

The landlord offers it for what they think its worth per month, and potential tenants can either accept the terms, negotiate the terms, or reject the terms and look elsewhere. <br>  <br>  The best way to find a starting point is to compare the unit to other units in the area based on size, quality, and quality of location. For example 2,000 sq ft on a busy street right next to a busy store is worth more as retail space then the same square footage a block away on a back road where nobody will see it.

AA10469473	If you file separately, or file jointly with an injured spouse form,  you won't be responsible for what he owes unless you filed a joint return with him last year when he owed the tax - if you did, then you're stuck with it.|`|SK2gGFoyaa	Unless you are planning a divorce it makes more sense to file jointly to take the credits. Because a tax preparation is a deductible expense, you may wish to consider a tax specialist that works with the self employed. Hopefully he's kept all receipts for work related expenses to get the most tax shelters. Once you have the professional support from a tax specialist this year you should be able to use the guidelines for future year tax filing on your own. You can figure out both seperate and jointly if you'd like but the joint filing will probably be to your advantage.|`|KWNTNThuaa	You can file separate, depending on your situation it could or could not help you.  In certain states, like Ohio, it is beneficial to compare Married filing separate and married filing joint.  If your wages are close together it may work, if it is more like 65/35 split between spouses it generally is not worth it because of the different tax brackets.  Your husband's social security tax is reported on Schedule SE or line 57 on the 1040.  My recommedation is to handle the situation internally and ask for the money.|`|0F8hauikaa	It's usually best to combine incomes and file jointly, but unfortunately, your withholding will be applied to what he owes. Pay 'em now or pay 'em more later. Taxes...Grrrr<br>  <br>  Is your husband paying quarterly? I have found this the best way when self-employed. It's too hard to pay one lump sum, for me anyway.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	you both may be responsible for the taxes owed.
f96fc627f519f3ac55a4b380b5d54678aa	The construction of new buildings in the Green Belt is inappropriate by definition unless for the following:<br>  <br>  *Agriculture or forestry<br>  *Essential facilities for outdoor sport or recreation, cemeteries or other land which preserve the openness of the green belt<br>  *Limited extension, alteration or replacement of dwelling<br>  *Limited infilling in villages & limited affordable housing<br>  *Limited development or infilling of major sites in accordance with development plans<br>  <br>  Obtaining planning permission in the green belt is very difficult to achieve without a) regard to the above and b) without justification.  He should firstly check with the local planning authority strategic planning team to see if the land has any potential for allocation through the local plan/LDF and secondly seek the advice of a planning consultant. <br>  <br>  If its a greenfield site which is not well related to the adjoining settlement, with poor infrastructure, harmful to the landscape etc etc then I would advise to proceed with caution.  If the deal is from a company selling off parcels of land (ie building plots) then it is more than likely to be dodgy and best avoided.<br>  <br>  Obviously towns and cities need to expand over time and the major settlements have green belts to effectively stop sporadic urban sprawl; they are never designated for their beauty.  Bristol for example is likely to expand southwards at Ashton into North Somerset through a large planned urban extension through the LDF; this is still someway off though (www.ashton-park.co.uk)|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Much greenbelt land will never get planning permission for development.  In your lifetime anyway. There are many groups and councils zealously safeguarding greenbelt land and strenuously resist development on it.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	That doestn't make sense. Gaining permission to greenbelt land is very difficult without being a large corporate company or being very rich.<br>  Planning permission takes forever. But yes there is a large amount of money to be made when owning land, in lots cases you do not even have to build on the land. It is also a very solid investment depending on where it is and how much you own.|`|kgonf3jPaa	landbanking, speculation call it what you will, planning permission on greenbelt is not impossible, but is almost impossible to obtain . Agricultural ties on existing property and land in greenbelt are also almost impossible to get lifted unless you have very deep pockets to pay for the legal bods and appeals etc. So it could be a very long term investment. In fact so long that he might have doubled his money investing it elsewhere. People do do it, I saw a fair few plots go at one auction about 15 years ago, it has recently been built on, BUT only because it is now by a brand new very busy road,approaching  the M6 toll road, so it may also NOT be 'greenbelt' by the time he gets PP, land does get re-designated occasionally, but would it double his money then? hardly desirable! wheras the reclaimed brownfield sites nearby are quieter,  more desirable, well landscaped and generally a better prospect all round|`|ARAYm7BLaa	This is an absolute scam, there is no chance of getting planning permission for green belt land.....it's been going on for years and people have lost a load of money on this....and now with the credit crunch it is even less likely to occur...google landbanking for more details

And even that will take weeks.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	You can, you'll need the proof of postage receipt given when the item was first posted through the post office, or the online receipt if it was posted using there online facility. You can only claim up to ￡32 i think it is at the moment for standard packages. You also need to wait a certain amount of time before the post office class the package as missing.

rrp9c2tnaa	I frequently pass up Wal-Mart to shop at Winn Dixie.  Especially for meats, produce and some dairy items.  However, Wal-Mart is a lot cheaper on certain products such as pet foods, cereals, coffee, deli meats, canned veggies, and pastas.  Winn Dixie has a much wider selection of frozen veggies, frozen breads and entrees. If you learn what you have to go to Wal-Mart for, and buy that stuff once or twice a month, you can do most of your shopping at Winn Dixie and still come out about the same.  The Winn Dixie here puts their discount card program sales, especially for meats, beginning on Wednesdays.  That is the best day to go.|`|kyUiaDgyaa	Winn Dixie?

If he acts the way you say he does, he's not fit for an entry position, much less management. That right there tells you they're incapable of judging people. <br>  <br>  If they think some lousy schmuck is management material, then how can you expect them to realize the potential in you? It goes both ways - you can't expect bad judgement sometimes and good judgement others.<br>  <br>  You're working for confused losers. Cut your lossed and move on.|`|NkAFBgxRaa	Even though 32 hours are the minimum you would probably end up spending much more time stressing and actually working as a manager. I know it sucks but it's probably for the best! If you're in school right now you probably can't commit the time and energy that they need for this position, and you wouldn't be able to do as good of a job as you would like.
AA10033605	Hopefully the main motivation for charity is to help people. If that helps the company reputation, so much the better.
AA10628838	Yes. That is why you charge for shipping. You can wrap the book in heavy brown paper or ship in a padded envelope to help with the cost of the shipping. You need to weigh the book and figure in any supplies and ask that amount for the shipping.|`|f4ba47a2857db6a4c06027dd19f8455aaa	I agree with Jelly Bean here about saving costs by shipping in a bubble-mailer or flat manila pouch as the same exact size and weight in a carton will be dramatically more to send. It is all because of the postal regulations about which classification it may fall into, whether it is billed as "Parcel Post" (Boxes, Cartons, and Parcels) or "Letter Post" (Envelopes, Pouches, 2-sided Mailer Sleeves). I think that is such a trivial difference and I think that's another part of why the Post Office hasn't turned a profit in a long damned time, either. aside from the fact that this generation is digitized and no longer mail any letters, leaving the postal workers slinging overstuffed sacks of junk-mail at much cheaper bulk-rate prices that most people don't even want and which litter our hallways, homes, and streets, en masse! I have also heard of people increasing their profits on eBay sales by overstating and overcharging their shipping rates and pocketing the difference when the actual package shipped comes and says like 86 cents instead of the $6.95 that some unscrupulous seller collected but that is a terrible and highly reportable offense via e-Bay's own anti-fraud arm and also through vendor ratings where we can all ***** about some vendor overcharging like that. I believe that e-Bay does keep a very tight rein on stuff like that and I commend them, but I still occasionally see some stuff like that popping up in the myriad of sales on that megalithic site. I absolutely LOVE eBay and I shop almost exclusively at eBay, mainly, and maybe some other sites like Overstock.com. I just thought I'd add my info here as it touched on a subject near and dear to my heart: eBay!
AA10761859	Amazon.com is undoubtedly the best place online to sell books.Because they reach millions of people and also offer customer reviews on a wide array of topics.Which will get you an idea just how well this book really is.But i would suggest doing a search on the type of book you are selling (i.e. used,rare,ebook) and visit some of the top results.ebay and kijiji are also places you might consider.

azazvgxIaa	I would strongly advise you against capital one.  They recently raised all of their customers APR's because of the "difficult economic times"  I have had a card with them for over 5 yrs at a rate of 8%, I have never been late with them or any other card and I received a letter stating that I have one year to pay it off or the rate will increase to either 17.9 or 14.9 over prime (apparently they will decide that later).  All my good credit and excellent history got me with capital one was the one year period, others apparently had the change take effect immediately.  I will pay off the card and get one with a lower rate, there are a million other companies with better rates.  <br>  <br>  P.S. A credit card with an annual fee is never a good thing, try and find a company without it, perhaps Chase I have two cards with them and no annual fees.<br>  <br>  If you have zero credit, you could probably expect a limit of 350 to 500 for the first few months and if you make your payments they will bump you up.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	The best credit card is one that you can pay in full each month.<br>  Carrying balances will destroy your credit and possibly destroy your life.<br>  <br>  Save up, so you can pay this off when you get the bill.<br>  I achieved top scores by paying in full each month.<br>  Never paid a penny interest or a fee for anything.<br>  Plus earned $400/ year on cash back rewards.<br>  /|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Have you shopped around and make application for a cc with a lower interest rate and no annual fee? If you haven't give it a try, the worst that can happen is you get turned down.  if you have and been turned down then this may be the best you can get. Starting limits depend on many variables (known only to them) so I really have no idea what yours  would be.  If your make your payments on time at some point they will give you a higher limit. Be sure you are never even one day late. Most ccs no longer have a grace period so one day late to them is the same as 30 days. The punishment is  they will  immediately raise your interest rate and yours is high already. You do know that your first bill will have a $59 balance because of the annual fee? Any card can be paid in full every month and that should be your objective.|`|7B9a65xaaa	If this is your first credit card than you have no credit which is basically the same as having bad credit. In todays economy you will probably be turned down anyways so i wouldn't waste a credit inquiry trying. Your best bet is to get a secured credit card with a major bank  to start building a credit  history, after one year, if you pay on time ,they will switch you to unsecured. Bank of America and US Bank are good choices since their annual fee is only $29 or so.|`|hQD52b4Maa	If this is going to be your first CC, either it will be a secured CC or a limit of 300.00 dollars.|`|mcgONGBVaa	I recently discovered a company called Lending Club and think you might want to hear about what they do.<br>  <br>  Lending Club brings together individual investors and well-qualified borrowers in a new approach that provides a better deal for both.<br>  <br>  Harvard Business Review said Lending Club was one of the best new ideas of 2009, and this is what Wired magazine just said about the transparency of their system:<br>  <br>  "If the financial markets were as open as Lending Club... the combined efforts and innovation of all investors would make the system as a whole more secure."<br>  <br>  At Lending Club people with excellent credit can get loans at rates 20% to 30% lower than traditional sources.

Its a real good thing that you kept the reciept because that is your only evidence what the item was worth. They may say they will inspect the item, but often times they use this as a scare tactic and never do. Hold on to that receipt and make your claim.

izLEVnKIaa	A stock dividend can come in several different forms, it doesn't have to be in cash. This is a type of stock split/ secondary offering hybrid which is much easier to explain if you put a hypothetical price in place.<br>  <br>  Assume at the start the company have 1,000,000 authorized shares at $1, giving a market capitalization of $1,000,000. we will also assume that there is 1 outstanding shareholder for ease of explanation, that holds 600,000 shares for a total investment of $600,000. the other shares are usually held by the company for voting rights purposes or still held by the original owner.<br>  <br>  This 2 for 1 dividend will mean that the shareholder will receive an extra share for every one he already has, which as you pointed out increases the number of authorized shares to 1,600,000 with 1,200,000 held by the shareholder. Because there has been no additional value created in this transaction the market cap stays the same so each share is now worth 1,000,000 / 1,600,000 or $0.625 per share of which our shareholder now owns 1,200,000 of giving a total investment of $750,000 meaning that the dividend was worth $150,000 or a dividend yield of 15%.<br>  <br>  There is a further bonus for our investor and the reason why this type of dividend is quite rare. Because the original holder shares were not part of the dividend (or it would have just been a stock split and no extra value would have been created) the original holders have been diluted from 40% to 25% of the company, with the investor gaining from 60% to 75%.<br>  <br>  To understand this further for your homework write up i suggest looking up stock-splits, secondary offerings and stock dilution so to give yourself a better understanding of what happen.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

And this debt is now growing faster than ever before.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your investment scheme would make sense to a lot of people, if the government budget was under control.  But unfortunately, government spending is now completely out of control.  And such an out of control spending can bring financial disaster for everyone in the country.  <br>  <br>  Instead of investing in anything, people should be saving like crazy for future taxes, which will surely go sky high in not too distant future.

kb9k1jn1aa	Apart from using your money to make more money by investing it... the can also lend to individuals about 10 times what they receive.<br>  ie: If you deposit $1000 in the bank, the bank will be able to lend $10,000 to Joe who just came after you... and they will charge Joe interest in the $10,000... the bank does not need to have the money in cash to lend it out. In this case the bank is happy to pay you 5% interest on the $1000 ($50 in one year) because if they charge Joe 8% on the $10,000 they'll make in 1 year $800... total profit for the bank $800-$50 = $750.<br>  Would you like to be a banker? :)<br>  Hope it helps!|`|on9xLWegaa	Because they give the money from the depositors to the borrowers and want to pay the depositors an incentive to put their money in that bank.|`|CyS4CfDVaa	the banks are not dumb.  they realized that they have no reason to hold your money safe AND pay YOU an interest.  the banks pay you interest to keep your money safe is because they're using YOUR money to make money.  the banks don't take your money and put it in the drawer.  they invest it.  let's say the bank pays 3% interest for keeping your money safe.  you give them a $100.  the bank will take your money and invest it into safe and profitable investments as they see fit.  let's say at the year's end, the bank makes 20% profit on YOUR money and gives your 3%. meaning the banks just made $17 on YOUR money by just investing and doing nothing more.

efdb04ba6a4a066db7fc97aeb97e9037aa	More than likely an association is already in place.  You should receive a copy of the Handbook for your review.

The county that I live in has a listing of recognized condo associations on it's official website, maybe your jurisdication does too.   You should go to their website and search.   If I were you I would want to be very certain because condo fees can be a huge monthly expense.  You would not want to find out as you get closer to closing on the condo that an assoc is there.

OCVFrgeXaa	Banks haven't lost at all.  The Appeal Court rejected the Bank's appeal and said that the OFT do have the right to review bank charges i.e. that it is within their jurisdiction.

He should be able to do so, effect the date that he took custody of her. If she visits the ER, he will most likely be held responsible for the bill anyways, not her. He is being negligent by not seeking medical care for her if she is ill (although making her pay for her own things does not constitute abuse).<br>  <br>  edit: Sounds like she's in a tough spot being her own parent. I would contact your county health department and see what clinics they have available.

Usually there funded by local businesses in the same market, or local communities if it's seen as being important. However, i don't think a sun bed shop classes as one of these businesses so you'd probably have to look for outside funding and people to help you. If you went and spoke to someone in your local library or council business office, they could probably point you in the right direction as to who to go to in seek of help. Most big libraries have Specialist in certain fields to help with your search, even if it was directing you to a website or give you a contact number. If your under 30 contact your local prince's trust, they have a starting up business guide on there website, if you ring up and ask to speak to someone you'll be given your own personal business help and they can give you all the advice you need.|`|STYhiMEyaa	Speak to your local Business Link.  They have lots of free help and advice for starting your own business.<br>  <br>  One of the key thing about setting up a sun bed shop is location.  Being in a prominent position will be to your advantage.  The downside of that is that it's usually more expensive than premises off the main streets.<br>  <br>  Business Link can advice on what funding is available.  They'll help with putting together your business plan, which all funders will want to see.  It's also helpful to prepare a plan for your own use, whether you need funding or not.

If you've no way of telling people what you do, you won't have a business.  It's not enough just to have a shop window.  You have to drive them to it.  It's like people having websites and assuming they'll be found.<br>  <br>  The other things you need to sort are insurance, a business bank account and notify Inland Revenue.

(It might actually be better to put this in writing, so you have proof later, if you need it.)<br>  <br>  If you make no effort to repay, then they may actually come after you for that money, either through wage garnishment or a lawsuit (I was subject to both, from different creditors; the garnishment was never put through, due to the expense, and another creditor sued me for the money. Those papers arrived in my mailbox the day I filed for bankruptcy in 2004.)<br>  <br>  However, their legal recourse is limited when you demonstrate a REASONABLE effort to repay those debts. Right now, as long as you pay a minimum of five dollars, and do an excellent job keeping such records, the credit card companies will be the ones with egg on their faces should they seek a wage garnishment or other action. You can then say, "Judge, here's a record of all payments I've made to this company." (Of course, I'm not advocating that you pay ONLY five dollars to each credit card; it's better to pay as much as possible, but it will satisfy the legal requirement of "reasonable effort.")<br>  <br>  Right now, explain to each of them - in writing - your situation, and that you wish to repay your debts, and that you will make every effort to do so. You also want to be consistent and timely with your payments for the good-faith issue, so their legal options are limited.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|VkpQJ0LSaa	If your debt is unsecured, then no collateral has been attached to this debt and if you default on the account, creditors will surely try to collect from you but they cannot take your property and assets. <br>  <br>  Have you looked for any alternatives or programs out there to help you eliminate you debt?<br>  <br>  There are plenty of resources that can help you reduce the amount of debt and even eliminate it.  One of the programs that has been getting more and more popular is Debt Settlement, have you heard about it?...I know that it is a negotiation where the company that represents you deals with your creditors in order for you to pay them back a much lower percentage of the overall debt you have with them, and savings to consumers can range from 50%- 70% with the majority of creditors. <br>  <br>  Debt Settlement Companies work based on your available funds, so the more you can put towards it the faster they can negotiate the debt and since you decide not paying the creditors while the negotiation is being done, you can just take care of the important things and living expenses.<br>  <br>  I hope this information has been helpful.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.curadebt.com/forum/blogs/david/141-can-creditors-come-after-my-home-other-assets-unsecured-debt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.curadebt.com/forum/blogs/davi...</a>|`|jyoph3WQaa	I would recommend you take care of this and put it behind you ...<br>  <br>  This is a company that I would highly recommend ...<br>  <br>  I had a friend who used this and they were highly efficient and friendly:<br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/DebtConsolidation" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/DebtConsolidation</a>|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	No, but they can garnish your paychecks and seize your tax refunds.  The only way you can lose those things are if you are convicted of fraud during the use of the cards.|`|KFYwzXtyaa	The fact that this debt is unsecured means that it isn't being backed up by properties or assets, so they can't go after your home or assets. <br>  <br>  Please understand that they do have the right to pursue legal action if payments aren't made for a while. There are certain steps that need to take place prior to them taking you to court. The debt must go from your original creditor - to a collection agency who will then send it back to the original creditor who will send it to another collection agency who will then send it to a law firm , they will send it to litigation's and they will pursue the judgment.  The time frame can range from 2-4 years which can vary. There are debt settlement companies that can delay the process and get you more time for you to settle with lump sums that can also be payed in installments. <br>  <br>  One the biggest mistakes Americans make is not showing up to court in case of legal action. You need to understand that if you present yourself to court and show that you are in fact having some difficult times, the chances of them ruling against you are slim to none. It's important that you aren't living an extravagant lifestyle in order for this to be true. <br>  <br>  If you're starting to fall behind; I strongly recommend that you look at your options and take the time to compare them in order to make the best decision. Debt settlement might be a great option for you that will take less than 3 years. <br>  <br>  I hope I was able to help inform you and help you with your situation.|`|3DlEfnleaa	The short answer is NO.  Your credit card are "unsecured", therefore, you didn't have to give them any kind of collateral.  The worst they would do is start legal proceedings and at which time the judge would just make you work out a payment plan which will then include court costs and attorney fees, but it rarely comes to that unless you owe like 20,000 or more.|`|P6AWsK6maa	If the companies take you to court, a get judgment.

They will however, usually offer a very low interest rate for a year or so if you consent to having a higher than the minimum payment come automatically out of your checking account every month.|`|tmh42R6Caa	You just give them a call and say something like, "I want to pay this card off, but I don't have all the money yet.  Is there any way to pay you what I have now and call it even?"  However, if you do this, your credit report will read something like, "Closed - settled for lesser amount".  I don't know if it hurts your credit, but it will be visible to everyone that you didn't pay it in full.

If this is the case they also have to pay for your legal costs to agree this, and you (by law) have to have consulted a solicitor.<br>  The solicitor will check that what they are offering is fair and matches the law.<br>  Being made redundant is not voluntarily giving up your job, so you don't miss out on benefits. <br>  If they are doing something else or you live outside the UK, then get legal advice.<br>  If they are making you redundant and asking you to work your notice you should still get a redundancy payment, so the cash payment is to "compromise" (i.e. give up) your rights to work your notice.<br>  <br>  What ever happens as soon as you are not working call the Job Centre Plus  and sign on so you get your benefits and help finding a new job.<br>  For more help see the Citizens Advice Bureau - ask at the town hall where it is, or speak to a solicitor. Most solicitors will give you 15 minutes or so "free advice"|`|kRujnPqoaa	Check this up in more detail on www.direct.gov.uk for the rules governing UK benefit entitlement. <br>  <br>  You'd be entitled to make a claim for benefit (i'm making an assumption that you mean Jobseekers Allowance here.)

34CfVwbFaa	I'm very new into it, and learned a bit only through looking into the insurance sales field - but basically, financial planners go over people's finances and financial goals, then try to pick investment strategies, like annuities, life insurance policies, CD's, etc.,  to create options to help the client develop a portfolio that would help achieve their investment aims.  I believe some may charge a 'consultation' fee - and probably earn much of their income from commissions for investment vehicles they sell. You have to take course work,pass state exams and become licensed to be a 'financial planner'. Hope this helps.|`|RcAofGkIaa	A financial planner is a broad category, and a financial planner may offer a number of services:<br>  a) Hard-core financial planning.  Looking at your income, your savings, your goals, your risk tolerance, your budget, a lot of factors, and helps to invest your savings at a rate of return that is acceptable to you.<br>  b) Insurance.  Looks at your insurance coverage, including personal liability coverage.  Based on your assets, may recommend raising, or broadening the scope of your current insurance, including health insurance.<br>  c) Individual financial planning.  Looks at your expenditures and can help you design a budget that helps you meet your financial goals. <br>  d) Major purchases advice.  Should you buy a new car?  do you have the cash?  Should you finance it?  How?  New house?  same questions.<br>  e) Wills and legacies.  helps you figure out what to give and when to help your heirs avoid maximum taxes.<br>  <br>  Stock brokers who bill themselves as financial planners often aren't.  A good financial planner offers a large range of services.|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	A financial planner assists you in achieving your financial goals. That can consist of investments and insurance. Some work on a percentage of what they sell and others work on a fee basis. They may sell stocks, bonds, mutual funds and insurance.

Rp6cxboYaa	Once it goes to collection, it has already affected your credit history.  However, it affects it even more adversely if you still don't pay it, and can also lead to legal action against you.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Continued non-payment may result in legal action. But this is not always a bad thing. A judge will only make you pay at a rate you can afford, which is sensible. Sometimes people are asked to pay nothing at all, for example if the non-payment is on a hire purchase agreement, and you have already paid a fair price plus reasonable interest, English judges sometimes find for the defendant in such matters.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	They sue you.  You lose.  If you still do not pay after losing in court, then they garnish your wages.|`|46eoAIGZaa	Yes it will affect your credit rating.  As long as your debt is in collections it will show on your credit rating, dropping your score.  Also they can take you to court (with or without you present) and have a judgment settled against you.  If you still do not pay that, the judge can order a garnishment through your payroll.  Depending on your state it can be as much as 75% of your disposable income (the money after taxes).  I would try to settle out of court if possible.<br>  <br>  To answer your second question- It can take up to a year for them to go from just a non-payment to the payee--go to collections--judgement--garnishing your wages.  It can take less and it can take a little more, but on the average that is pretty much what I've seen.|`|tmh42R6Caa	It actually affects your credit twice.  For example, you would see one line for the store and the status would be "unpaid - sent to collections".  Then you would see another line for the collection agency.  Plus, each month that you don't pay that bill it shows up as a late payment.  You're just racking up late payments for both companies.  You definitely need to pay that collection if at all possible.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	You can be sued which may result in garnished wages and seized tax refunds.
AA11182621	Ask them for the Insurance terms, they will send them to you, then go straight to Is not covered section, then go to you are covered by, then you will have a pretty good idea what is covered. You must do this now, as otherwise you can miss out on any claim. They do not pay retrospectively. So make sure you get your claim in asap
S4soZUFCaa	Definitely, unless your conduct was intentionally negligent you'll get unemployment.|`|AA10469473	Something like that shouldn't disqualify you for unemployment unless they can show you were stealing - not likely for $3.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	don't know about where you live but in the UK if you get fired you don't get unemployment benefit for 3 months if you were fired
t3CSfffOaa	Unless it was theft, I believe so. It will be your word against theirs though.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	While state laws may vary slightly, most indicate only if you were fired under certain conditions such as fraud or theft. $3 off is insignificant and may be because of the downsizing. My bank had a $10 limit per day averaged over 30 days.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	Did you get fired for a $3 shortage or mainly because of downsizing? If you have a history of being reprimanded for being short, then they may have had good reason to fire you, but if it was just a one time thing then you should have no problem receiving unemployment. <br>  <br>  Go down to the unemployment office and file a claim and they should be able to walk you through it.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're interested in a way to make some money from home while you are looking for new work or even just on the side when you find a new job, check out the link below.

You only get unemployment if you laid off because your job was dissolved.
J62umtpDaa	Most defense contractors (lockheed, raytheon, etc) will ask for GPA, as will some government projects.  Occasionally larger companies will ask for it too.  In general a 3.0 is good enough, very rarely a 3.5 or higher may be required (if they care about GPA at all).<br>  <br>  Every interview i've had (as a software engineer) has had a large technical section on the interview, i would imagine EE's will get the same.<br>  <br>  If a company looks at your GPA, its a requirement to even get an interview.  Once you're in an interview, the technical questions are the most important thing.<br>  <br>  Once you have your first job, GPA counts for much less.  Once you hit about 3 yrs of experience, companies don't usually care.  I've only come across one exception to this, a govt project that required a 3.0 GPA even after 3 yrs of industry experience.|`|tmh42R6Caa	I am actually a recruiter for Lockheed Martin and I mainly deal with Engineers.  For our interns and entry level professionals, we require a 3.0 GPA.  My current intern class right now has an average GPA of 3.41.  With the market getting tighter a higher GPA will definitely help you.  However, I think anything over 3.0 is fine.|`|RQdFRaANaa	I’m an ME so my experience might be a little different, but when I graduated GPA was often a requirement for on campus interviews (3.0 was the most common number I saw, but I saw about +/-0.25 either way). By the time I actually got to interviews most were primarily non-technical questions: like talking about work, leadership, responsibility, etc. experiences. Hope this helps!

I solved it by listing the one working reference I had and then I listed  a prof from school that knew me and could speak to my work ethic in class.  maybe that could work for you.

f6y3pM4oaa	Issuing coupons with discounts does in fact lower the profits of the company that has issued them; however, if you look at it at the other side, companies are actually marketing their products or service because it will attract customers' attention like yourself. Just put it this way, you went to that store due to the fact that you got 35 cents off and my question is, if they didnt offer you the 35 cents off coupon, maybe you could have chosen other companies. They might make less profit but at least they are getting your money. Second, economies of scales which means the more they sell, their cost to produce something will decrease; therefore, it actually does not affect them. By issuing these coupons, companies expect a lot of people to come into their business and that's what all companies want. I am a business owner and I will definitely offer 15% off right now if someone is truly willing to buy my products and services.
AA11173563	you can do that but the police should be called as well so they can patrol more often|`|4UBxVIYFaa	I would hope that your offer to purchase included a proviso that the home would be in the same condition as when you viewed same for purchase consideration.  If not, you could be in deep trouble.<br>  <br>  The owner of the home bears responsibility for items stolen, but your purchase contract should also indicate that you bought what you viewed.<br>  <br>  If your contract includes no such language, you are probably facing a protracted legal battle.  With any sort of luck, the lender who owns the property will work with you in this situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	If it's not your property yet, then it's the responsibility of whoever owns it currently to replace the things that are being stolen.   You signed a contract with the understanding that there will be a heating and air unit in it.  If it is not there now, then you are under no obligation to continue with your portion of the contract.  It doesn't matter whether or not the house was abandoned.  If it is not YOUR property yet, it is the responsibility of whoever is the current owner to take care of this.  It is not your responsibility to replace things that are being taken.<br>  Talk to your real estate agent, and make it clear that the people you are signing the contract with replace anything that goes missing from the property, or you will sue.  In forclosure situations, the previous owners will sometimes take everything they can from the house.  A friend of mine who is a real estate agent has told us stories of people taking everything right down to the lighting fixtures and even ripping crown moldings off the wall when they've been foreclosed on. I'd have that looked into, because my guess is that's what might be going on here.|`|91XVWCWWaa	Since it is a bank owned property, by law they do not have to do anything.  Please go back and read your contract.  This is what you need to look for........"AS IS" which means you bought the house in the condition it was in irregardless of whether items in the house were stolen.  The planter is not a fixture, it is considered personal property.  If this was a new home construction then the builder would be responsible for the replacement of anything stolen that is considered real property (heating and air unit). It is a "BUYER AWARE"  situation.<br>  This is one of the loopholes that many buyers are not aware of.|`|n4Wp6ei1aa	I don't know where you're at but I do an AVID. That's where an agent does an Agent Visual Inspection Disclosure. I give it to the buyers and also to the Listing Agent. I do this within a day or so of the offer being accepted.<br>  Anything that changes after that, I simply ask the listing agent (who in turn tells the lending insitution or bank that owns it) that this damage has been done, or this appliance is missing, etc.<br>  They have to fix it or we can back out of the deal without recourse as the property we made our offer on has significantly changed.<br>  They have always repaired it, installed it or made other equal adjustments.<br>  If they don't for whatever reason, we back out of the transaction and cancel it.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Withdraw your offer and reduce your new offer by the value of the stuff stolen.
2gFem71maa	I think that it's a very good option, when you have run out of all others.  But keep in mind, there are other options that you may have not considered, such as just not paying your bills.  Bankruptcy is kind of ugly--you will have to open up your whole financial history to the inspection of a trustee, judge, and creditors.  From talking with people who have been through it, I found out It can be a very stressful process especially with the negative stigma attached.  <br>  <br>  Since Mic Insky says it much better than me, I am going to include an excerpt from his book on credit card debt.  He talks about his experiences with walking away from debt and he also talks about what he learned about bankruptcy.  It might be a helpful read.   <br>  <br>  "...Most importantly, do not believe the negative messages that the credit industry as a whole is propagating about those who fall into debt!<br>   You're not a coward if you decide to pay off the debt that the industry has placed on your shoulders, nor are you a coward if you choose to file bankruptcy, nor are you a coward if you decide to follow the Do-Nothing route (e.g. not pay bills).<br>   You are not running from your problems—you are taking a move that is legally yours to take.<br>   Be easy on yourself.  ...You are thinking logically if you realize that, given your present economic position, you may never pay off your credit card debt.  After all, the credit card company has spent millions designing it that way.<br>   ...Do not be afraid of taking positive steps and do not look to debt collectors or credit card companies for advice on what your best options are.  They will always say that you should pay them—no matter what that may mean to you and your family."|`|7B9a65xaaa	Bankruptcy sucks but it isn't the end of the world. Better to file and be done with it then prolong the inevitable if you have no other options. I think people make it seem worse than it really is because it stays on your credit for 10 years. After 2 years, you can usually be eligible to buy a home or car if you have your other financial ducks in a row. At least the debt collector phone calls stop!|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Depends on the situation that brought you to that point.  If you lost your job or got very sick and owe tons in medical expenses, then you have to do what you have to do.  However, I do not agree with people who are simple irresponsible with money and rack up tons of credit cards bills and realize that they are in over their heads.  Those are the types of people who need to be hung out to dry in bankruptcy court and not bailed out out by them!|`|2Hraw073aa	I filed for bankruptcy last year and will be discharged in May this year (UK laws applicable)<br>  <br>  I can only say this: bankruptcy is not fun and should be considered as a last resort  It is all ok and very well for others to say "you're running away" and that i was stupid for running up debt, but at the end of the day, it WAS my only option.  I became ill from worry and i still suffer from a panic disorder of which i am fighting.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, if someone is experiencing financial difficulties then seek help.  Speak to creditors and speak to a professional debt adviser.  Do what needs to be done.  There is NO point is getting ill over things that have happened in the past.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be biblical here, but "let the first without sin cast the first stone"  We have all messed up things in our lives and it's not fair to judge people.... only he who is sinless is allowed to do this.<br>  <br>  Best wishes and peace|`|a0lpVi8caa	I think if you have to, then do what is best for you. I suggest you get 3 consultations first and I suggest you look into seeing how you can repair your own credit first.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Now days it is not as negative as you would think.  There are going to be the ones who will look down on you without learning the reason for it.  If you have one or two in your life time due to unforeseen financial disasters it's one thing.  If you get one every seven or eight years to abuse the system to live beyond your means then you should be looked down on.  I went through a bankruptcy and my family understood that it was the best for me at the time.<br>  <br>  For me, what I think about it when I hear that someone went into bankruptcy is ok so what.

Mi2w3lvEaa	Retail stores make money buy paying less for items than they buy them for.   The difference is called the "markup" or when expressed as a percentage the "margin".  This is the simplest and most traditional retailer scenario.<br>  <br>  Today, especially with larger corporations, it is a bit more complicated -- it is not a simple "buy low sell high" situation but is more of a relationship.  To take your example a store like Best Buy might promote certain CDs in its advertisements because the record label gives them money for the advertising.  This is called co-op money.  <br>  <br>  Food retailers (supermarkets) are in the real estate business -- not the food business.  They sell shelf space to food manufacturers -- this is called slotting fees  The markup on an item might be rather small.<br>  <br>  There are other models like buying clubs -- Costco, Sams Club, BJs.  In this case the stores charge their customers a membership fee and this generates most of their profits.  Again the markup on the items they sell might be small.<br>  <br>  It only works if -- at the end of the day -- the stores and the businesses producing the items sold in the stores -- all make money.   It can be a complex relationship -- and doesn't always work for everyone in every case.|`|d305138b3a4d89bb9a20a75933040915aa	If you wish to stay in business, you need to make money. Hence for example, if you sell widgets for $2.00, you cannot buy them for the same price or close to the price. You need to pay maybe $1.00 for each to make something on the deal. Out of the dollar profit, you will pay rent, salaries, electric, insurance, snow removal, supplies, etc. <br>  You must calculate all this ahead of time to figure out what you need to make profit after paying the $1.00 for this item. Maybe you need to sell them for $2.50 or more. <br>  Seems to me you were really born Nov. 12, 1999
Umk8n1AJaa	It depends on the company policy and guidelines re vacation and sick leave. So, better that you re read the company manual. <br>  If the guidelines does not state anything about it, it means that the company will not pay your leftover leave. <br>  Personal Advice: Count the number of leave and extend the date of your resignation to accomodate the leave. (your original date of resignation + leave). You just need to file the leave ahead of the resignation so that the leave will be paid as part of your salary.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Vacation is usually paid for but it entirely depends on the company since no company is obligated to give paid leave for anything.  Some companies also have sick days expire every year.|`|AA11357056	I don't think they'd have to pay you for personal or sick time, but whether you're entitled to any vacation time depends on how it's set at your company. Some companies make you wait a year when you start before you even get vacation - in that case, the vacation you're using the next year was actually earned the year before. In that case, I think they should pay you for it if you leave.
AA11404742	Maybe they'll get wealthy, or maybe just move to middle class income levels.  I suspect a lot of it depends more on how hard they work and apply themselves, than anything to do with government programs.  <br>  <br>  More wealthy people got that way because they found a niche or market that wasn't being satisfied, and worked their butts off day and night, 7 days a week to make a living at it.  They aren't necessarily smarter than others, but they are hard, dedicated workers who kept their eye on the goal, and did whatever they could to make it happen.  No obstacle could hold them back for long.

3FerQ9Ehaa	NEVER CLOSE REVOLVING ACCOUNTS! It is detrimental to your credit score when you initiate the closing. Don't think that just because your closing it is going to go away from your credit report. In fact, it stays as a closed account and the money you owe is still counted towards your total money owed and what you would be doing if you close it is making the ratio of how much you owe on all lines of credit higher than your available credit: If you close it, your available credit is -$10,000. For example, if your total owed is $20,000, and your available credit is $25,000, you'd still owe $20,000, but your available line if the account is closed would be $15,000, which doesn't do your score too good. So to manage the account, instead of making minimum payments, pay at least twice the minimum payment instead or if more, even better. It will help cut the finance charges you are being charged. It's going to take some time, but the benefits in the long wrong will be good for you, especially during these rough times.

However, that is a clue that some of the other things (that do matter) might also be incorrect, so check everything more carefully.<br>  <br>  Your credit report should list some of the places to which you owe money, including their addresses.  Start by paying them.<br>  <br>  When you pay back a debt, your credit rating gets somewhat better, because the debt becomes a paid debt, instead of an unpaid debt.  However, because you did not pay it on time, it continues to hurt you (although less than before it was paid).|`|uSqisBIaaa	First try out to whom you owe and how much you owe them. In this your credit report can help you.

By paying back gradually you would improve your credit history.|`|angW1Lkfaa	I'm on Social Security and each month I make out my budget it shows who I owe money to, how much, payments made, balanced owed, how much I get minus money paid. what's left is food money forget any extras.If you want help laying one out email me.I know it's a lousy situation to be in but have to have some kind of control|`|20lCgb6Uaa	If your catalogue agreements were dated before 1 April 2007 (and any credit cards or personal loans) you may be able to get them legally cancelled.

LeaUjOoUaa	Let your mortgage company know that the letter was not enough proof to substantiate the payment. Perhaps they can provide more such as a copy of the electronic transaction from their institution. It is in the mortgage companies best interest that the proof of payment be made. Property taxes take presidence over loans which is why many lenders require the taxes be paid through them. They want the assurance that payments are made so they don't risk the loan. If a property was sold due to nonpayment of property tax, the lender would be out money because they won't get to collect any money from the sale of the house. By paying the taxes for you they are protecting their interests in the property. I would think any lender would be bending over backward to assure that this is settled. Whenever an electronic transaction is sent, there are verifications and trackings on them, so there should be plenty of proof to show that the money was sent and received.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Ask the mortgage company for a copy of the "mass electronic check".
oU9rI4woaa	It doesn't sound like you hit the other car.  If you hit that car hard enough to knock a piece of the trim/molding off you would have damage on your car.  Hitting snow can make a ton of noise and sound far worse than it is.|`|kYwxA7Abaa	I work as a claims specialist for a major insurance company. The question is whether you hit the vehicle or not.  If you are positive that your vehicle had contact with their vehicle, it is your responsibility to handle that accordingly.  I would suggest calling the local police to come out and do a report to protect you against any allegations that you left the scene of an accident.  Report it to your insurance co and be sure to make them aware that the parked vehicle has prior unrelated damage.  However, if you do not have any damage to your vehicle, whose to say contact was ever made?  If there are no witnesses--you would probably be able to get away with it.   Hit and runs are a commonplace thing.  The problem is if anyone saw you hit that vehicle and got your tag # then you could be charged with leaving the scene of an accident.  If you don't have any damage and you don't think the vehicles touched, then I wouldn't even worry about it.  If you hit them, do the right thing.  Insurance adjusters can work out the difference between old damage and new damage.

They try to make it as normal to what the patients (or sleep subject) schedule. It is quiet and darkened after the subjects come in and go to sleep. Some sleep centers have nursing staff that will work 4 days on and 4 days off. It just depends upon the schedule of the sleep center. The balance can become difficult but becomes routine  You can work with a small staff  (depends upon how large the center is) and you spend time monitoring patients and data. The working environment is clean and mellow and has individual rooms for the patients that look like little hotel rooms. They have monitors and leads that hook up to the subject.<br>  I suggest you call a sleep center or a hospital that has a sleep center and ask if you can have more information regarding the program. Or perhaps they can link you to information and education.<br>  Good luck.

Ch9TedMcaa	supply and demand|`|va8quhPtaa	Usually stocks go up when supply is insufficient and go down when there is no demand.|`|CDqKAIEAaa	An excellent question, ballerartist:<br>  <br>  First and foremost, the market goes up on<br>  the principle of supply v demand. <br>  <br>  When demand is prevalent, prices will rise,<br>  over time.  This creates a trend, and that trend<br>  will be to the upside.<br>  <br>  Within that trend there will be days when price<br>  goes down.  In an uptrend, a down day is more<br>  often a lack of demand, rather than the presence<br>  of supply.<br>  <br>  Why is that so?<br>  <br>  In an uptrend, demand has proven itself as being<br>  dominant.  Not every day has to be an up day,<br>  and when not, it reflects more of a lack of demand<br>  than supply taking over.<br>  <br>  <br>  There will be days when supply does come into<br>  the market in an uptrend.  You can recognize <br>  supply by a larger price range to the downside,<br>  for the day, and on increased volume.<br>  <br>  It may seem confusing, because supply and<br>  demand in the markets are cleverly disguised<br>  by larger money interests who do not want to<br>  show their hand, as it were, but this is an<br>  example of why markets go up and down, in<br>  a general way.|`|OKjBNCOzaa	buying, selling and off the street transactions by the company, do not invest in anything that you do not understand <a href="http://www.investor-relations-firm.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.investor-relations-firm.com</a>|`|4B4tQA7Xaa	The  ever changing of the  offer and demand of a product or service.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour.

o72Ng7IRaa	Employers like to get an all around picture when interviewing / hiring new people. Having activities and clubs on your resume / application shows that you are a social person. That might make or break a potential hire for a marketing job.|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	Being in activities shows that you can get good grades while you did all this other stuff at the same time.  You become a better candidate than a guy with the same GPA who hasn't done anything extra.  Even a guy who is an athlete, colleges know all the hours that they aren't able to study.  They take it into consideration.  Extra activities show that you can function in a group, be social, teamwork, have the ability to communicate to others, resolve conflicts, etc..  Really great skills for the workplace.  Clubs and sports show commitment, discipline.  Having a boring minimum wage job shows character too.  You are able to do something that isn't necessarily "fun".  Being in a club can also show a "true" interest in a field.  Like a science club.  <br>  <br>  I think it is great that they look at the "entire" person and not just grades.  Some really high GPA people are kind of weird and antisocial.

The policy is that if you want to let her charge something, then you get a second card for her.<br>  <br>  The policy is also that if you do let someone use your card, even if you only allow them to charge $0.01 (one cent), then you are reasonable for all their charges, and any resulting fees, even if they charge several million dollars.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Go in and talk to someone in a bank branch who will be willing to waive the fee if this is a rare occurrence.

No work or volunteer history does make it a bit of a challenge.<br>  That could make for a fairly short resume.<br>  Here are a few ideas for you ... <br>  First, I'd suggest that you and your friend figure out what kind of job they are most likely to get with the background they do have.<br>  Then, I would customize the resume to highlight why your friend is a good candidate for that type of job.<br>  You can use the following sections to add some "body" to the resume.<br>  <br>  Objective : a statement about what your friend hopes to accomplish with a job ... be "realistic" and focus on the things that employers offering that kind of job would respond favourably to. For example, if the job was for a receptionist, then you could say something like "An entry level position where I can learn about a business from the ground up."<br>  <br>  Skills : tell about what your friend knows how to do. Choose only things that are useful for the type of job they are interested in.<br>  <br>  Awards : has your friend ever gotten an award? if so, these things show an potential employer that the individual can apply themselves to something and succeed.<br>  <br>  Interests : tell about what your friend likes to do. Choose only things that are useful for the type of job they are interested in.<br>  <br>  Availability : tell when your friend is available for work e.g. immediately, in 1 month, available for night shift, etc.<br>  <br>  References : including references tells the employer that your friend is not afraid of being checked out.<br>  <br>  Hope these ideas are helpful.

If everyone can't agree on the new terms (new person and new price) then the old lease remains in tact, the rent stays the same and the new person can't move in.<br>  <br>  Simply put, if you make any changes you are basically starting a new lease, so of course the landlord can change the terms.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Most apartment complexes do not allow multiple renters unless you are in a specified college apartment complex where they don't care.  I would not have put a boyfriend on the lease.  If you want him to live with you and pay rent, that is one thing but adding a non-spouse to the lease doesn't make sense. Management always calls the shots.  Be sure to review your lease agreement totally before making waves with the management on this.

All that glitters is not gold. My advice to you is to volunteer for a while at one the places where you think you will enjoy the job. Treat your voluntary position like a real job. They are always looking for daytime volunteers at hospitals and the daycares will appreciate your help. However  I would discourage you from nursing because it is a physically and emotionally draining job especially for a young mother with young children like yourself. A day care sounds great but will you have the enthusiasm for your own kids at the end of the day after dealing with a bunch of kids all day for 8 hours?  The truth is, very few people are fortunate to be doing what they love for a living, the majority just tolerate their jobs for the paycheck.

wnb0EgaHaa	Very interesting question and dilemna, and one I have experienced also.  It's a tough situation to manage thru, and can be tougher when your superiors don't back you up effectively.  Many companies don't actually recognize and equip their managers to deal effectively with cross generational issues that come up, and often it's because they don't have the awareness that there are actually specific ways to manage it.<br>  <br>  I had the opportunity to take a class a few years ago given by a management consultant Joyce L. Gioia who was with a group called The Herman Group (Roger E, Herman, author, specializes in workforce stability and future trends.)  The entire class focused on managing employees from different generations effectively.  It was very helpful.  You might want to google them to see what you can find.  They've published a number of books, and contribute to several business publications on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  The things covered included the different values, expections, and life influences of different generations in the workplace, and how it impacts their goals and work styles.<br>  <br>  One of the things that I remember as being particularly interesting was the differences between motivations.  Just as people with different communication styles can be reached more effectively by mirroring their communication style and speaking to them in a way that is most comfortable to them, certain managerial approaches and specific  types of recognition are more effective with different generations.<br>  <br>  Of course, you deserve respect, and insubordination should not be tolerated, but when you manage, if you can find the way to address the root of what is influencing that person's behavior, and diminish or eliminate it, it will make your life so much easier and your team much more productive.  Ideally, you can use that information to gain her support, which will put you in a much better position than ending up having to deal with it thru corrective action.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email me if you'd like some more specific info or recommendations.|`|0IG3lEpaaa	That's a tough question. Naturally an older worker wants to not be subordinate to a younger manager. But in today's workplace there are many younger workers who are managers over older workers.<br>  <br>  For the last 10 years many of my managers have been younger than me. There is nothing you can do about it. <br>  <br>  If an older worker wants to be professional they must listen to their managers regardless of age.|`|bInF0Rhqaa	Age should never be an issue.  The only time I have seen this happen, is when the younger manager had a "holier than thou" attitude with their employees.  If you treat your workers with the utmost respect and cheerfulness, you may well not have an issue.  <br>  <br>  You say this is not being addressed in a serious manner, but why?  If you are in charge, even somewhat, and an employee is giving you a hard time, you should speak either with the employee or with them and your supervisor together, to sort out the issue.  If your company has an HR department, talk to them first.|`|dd8064abbae26533619e0de7adc3a9d8aa	You have to be a team player.  And age should never be an issue.  Employees must be held accountable at all times without any bias, of course.  As a subordinate, an employee must listen without any bias as well.  I understand that it's more difficult with older employees, since it's hard to "teach an old dog new tricks."  They want to do it their way, and I've seen it happen.  But it ultimately comes down to behaving like a rational, professional, adult and making sure their job reflects positively on you.  If that doesn't happen, get those pink slips, or call the temp agency and complain.|`|0rpS2b97aa	I think that it occurs equally with this situation and a when the employee is young with an attitude.  The overlooking part is largely affected by how strong the supervisor is.  Age should never be addressed as then you are opened up to "discrimination".  It should just be nipped in the bud.|`|WnUZCcytaa	Normally it happens in organizations.  In addition to your pleasant manners, be little more friendlier.  That will create a friendly environment  for them and they will start respect you and like you.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	they should treat it like any other person. a wong doing is a wrong doing. age should never be a factor. someone thought this person was right for the job and it should be respected|`|2H2RVmiEaa	I think it happens a lot, and the company should really do something about it in your case!|`|AA11724052	When one is assigned a task or placed in a position of authority, a basic concept of management is that the person be given the tools (authority) to accomplish the task. If you feel that you are encountering resistance to your managerial style and are failing to motivate subordinates in their efforts to achieve company goals, the time has come to lower the hammer.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	My opinion on that, is insubordination in a nasty word companies use to fire people without unemployment!!!|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	I can't speak to your situation as I don't know all of the details. But a few thoughts come to mind. <br>  It's likely , in my experience , one of 2 things. Bad / inexperienced leadership or a problem employee. If it's the former, it's relatively easy to fix (unless it's just a really bad manager; which in this case my money is that it's not). The easy fix is taking a step back and not demanding respect but earning it by doing. That's not to say being a pushover. But choosing battles very ,very carefully. Most aren't worth fighting. But , if something needs to be done, don't try to be an employees 'friend'. You can't be a good leader and try to be buddy-buddy. Just lead. Obviously, I know in your case that you are a friendly and kind person..doesn't mean to change that, just have a definite line. And never, ever take anything personally. It's a losing battle and not worth your energy. Put group dynamics and results first. If you choose any battle, don't make it about a lack of showing respect , but about something not getting done etc. Never call anybody under the carpet..stand up for your employees always and they will respect that. If there's an issue ,handle it one on one , behind  closed doors. And beat the hell out of them , hehe jk. Just be frank, and a bit 'removed'. Try to find a win-win.<br>  The latter...much the same approach, but remember don't put up with any BS. To not make it about age, simply don't bring that into it. You shouldn't have to 'exert' your leadership, it should simply be there. That's not easy, especially with a difficult employee. But , you can do it. I would most definitely still keep it less about respect displayed and more about results. And have a 1 on 1 meeting...not a slam, always bring something positive into it...like the pcp principal..praise, correct, praise. <br>  Also, just don't bite, I mean simply refuse to bite if they are just 'giving you a hard time' . If there's something concrete, address privately. If not, make a point of not falling for it. They will tire of it. Also, publicly , focus on praising (in a 'managerial way' not as a buddy) other coworkers as appropriate.<br>  <br>  Lol...soooo...I've fought being in management my whole career...was forced into it temporarily several times. It's a tough job, I don't like it. During one of my many leadership classes we had 'role play'...I always got to play 'the employee from hell' I have only actually been accused of insubordination once, by a project manager who was very insecure in her role, a college grad (older than me by just a bit) who felt employees were beneath her ,etc. She didn't last. I'm not saying that's what you are doing, I highly doubt it. But, it is very easy to try to force it when you're struggling with anything. Just remember, leadership can't be forced..that's more a 'manager'..if you want to be in management, you want to be a 'leader' not a 'manager'. <br>  <br>  Good luck. If that doesn't work..put superglue in her hair gel ;-)|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Well if everyone is saying she's always been like that then no one has had the guts to put her in her position, thus giving her the power and control. Myself would not put up with it be firm, but fair. Let her know that you are the one in charge, not her. Stand up for yourself or she will always walk all over you, earn that respect that is given as part of your position, and in earning future higher positions. Draw the line even if that means taking them in fact if there is going to be a discussion do not do it in public but explain to this lady this is how it is going to be period. It appears the authority people there have been afraid of her, you should not be.

bInF0Rhqaa	In all the places I worked, your last check is mailed to you in a week or two.  If you left on good terms, many times they will call you on the next payday to pick up your last check.  <br>  <br>  If an employee was let go for something illegal and not just against company policy, they were paid out in cash for what they had worked that pay period and then carted off by the cops.|`|T5ZAYYpNaa	it will vary from job to job.  like i know the receptionist here just got laid off.  i think she had direct deposit so they will either do that, or mail it to her.  if you know when they give out payroll you can go in on that day, just call your supervisor, they would tell you.
12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	I searched the pink card and am no expert by any means.  However, it states that the pink card covers pregnancy expences.  If you have the tan card there are co-pays. I'd suggest just calling Medicaid or your case worker.  That's what I found online though.<br>  <br>  The site also stated it must be used for VAILD dates.  So, this means you can only use that card for today and tomorrow.  It stated cards are usually recieved every 5th of the month.  You're supposed to get a new card each month, sign it, and use the new card which is typically good for a month.  Since your card only states Feb 28th your cards probably only last a month...although some can date to longer periods.  <br>  <br>  This link is for NC.  There is probably some variation from state to state.  Good luck!|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Depends what state your in.   You need to post your state.|`|mr4mBUqVaa	It really does depend on what state your in, but in NJ they just give you one hard card and than that's it, you never get another one, but some states may still be behind, and still send you a monthly paper card.  They will send you one in time for the new month and if not, you can call them and let them know you never received it.
MmTe8W8uaa	A return should be filed.  However, the refund may go to the bankruptcy estate, and therefore the creditors, rather than you.

F3h3WtMlaa	I used to work for a large bank, and this is how it goes. If you have outstanding debts, such as with the IRS, state government, Child Support, and Credit Card collectors and they "try" to resolve the matter with you to no avail, then they (the debt collectors) resort to the court system. They will issue a type of summons, to have you appear in court to discuss (or make you pay). If you "default" meaning you don't show, the court assumes you're trying to bail on your debt. At this point, they issue an order to "levy" your accounts. They input your social security number into a database to search your "assets" which is how they find your bank account. At that point, the bank is OBLIGATED to put such a levy on the account because it has been "court issued." In this case your boyfriend cannot close the account, or freeze it. The only time a person can request a "freeze" on their account is if the account holder has been a victim of fraud, OR if their checks have been stolen. In your boyfriends case, not only can he not close the account because of this levy but if the levy causes him to go into a negative balance, even IF he satisfies the levy, the bank will NOT close or freeze his account because now he is in the banks debt...Also, in regards to the charges-unfortunately, if your boyfriend has let this debt mount so high, what is happening is that even if he does make a payment towards the balance, he has accrued so much "interest" or "finance" charges that he will be paying towards satisfying the interest/finance charges 1st, and what is left over goes towards the unpaid balance. Unfortunately, there is NO WAY around that. <br>  <br>  -BEST OF LUCK
sxahupRTaa	Well first off a tax Credit is not like a tax rebate. A tax credit means you will get 8,000 deducted from your income. i.e. if you make 40,000 you will deduct 8,000 and your taxable income will be 32,000. My wife and I are also about to buy a new house. I am serving my third tour of Iraq and will be getting out of the Army when I return. Our biggest decision when I came over here was whether to save up money or pay off our credit cards. We decided to pay our credit cards and it has paid huge dividends. Our credit scores are now both over 740 and we are in a position where we can negotiate for what we want. Paying off your credit is the most important financial decision you can make. Along with not using credit whenever possible. Spend cash when you can and if you can't afford it....then you can't afford it. Follow the link for FAQ's about the tax credit. Good luck!!|`|9fed39238f286d3cd62baeb926026293aa	you have to own the house before getting the tax credit|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You would not get it now.   The taxes you are filling out now are for 2008.   You obtain the tax credit after you have a credit to claim.    If you buy in 2009 you get the credit when you file next year.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You and your husband must both be 'first time buyers' under the law to qualify for the $8000 tax credit.  A 'first time buyer' is defined as one who has not owned a primary residence in the three calendar years preceding the proposed purchase.<br>  <br>  If both of you qualify in that regard, you can get the $8000 credit as first time buyers.  If you have already filed tax returns for 2008, you can file an amended 2008 tax return to gain the credit after your purchase closes.<br>  <br>  You are free to do with the credit rebate as you choose.  It is not required that it be repaid.
rKhCLTRwaa	The risk-free rate of return is typically selected as the return of a US Treasury Bill. If you are calculating the firm's WACC to determine a discount rate for the firm, I would use the rate on a T-Bill expiring in the same timeframe as the cashflows you are modeling. (the 'ticker' for a 5 year treasury is "^FVX", and for a 10 year treasury is "^TNX"). As of 2/4/2009, the 10 year T-bill is at 3.01%, and the 5 year at 1.97%. I would use one of those for the Risk-free rate.<br>  <br>  The market return PREMIUM is the return ABOVE the risk free rate the 'average' market is returning. Thus risk premium = ACTUAL market return - risk free rate. There is no 'standard' definition as to the timeframe over which to find the average market return (since 1929? last 5 years? there are debates all over). I believe the 'post 1929' market return has been calculated at around 11%, so the risk premium would be 11% - risk free rate.<br>  <br>  Also note that you can calculate the WACC of any publicly traded company (Brinker International included) by entering the firm's ticker symbol at <a href="http://thatswacc.com." rel="nofollow">http://thatswacc.com.</a><br>  <br>  I just did it for ticker EAT and got a WACC of 11.14%, but you may want to try it yourself and change any variables you deem necessary.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
OzPheiN1aa	The only benefit could  be affected is Housing and Council tax Benefit. no other benefit is affected as your girlfriend is a non dependent adult, her income does not count towards her parents. <br>  <br>  The Local Authority will reduce Housing or Council Tax Benefit as thee is  anon dependent living there. There is no deduction for Housing and Council Tax where the claimant (ie Mum or Dad) is:<br>  <br>      * Registered Blind<br>      * In receipt of Severe Disablement Allowance<br>      * In receipt of Disability Living Allowance<br>  <br>  i would imagine that Mum gets DLA, so in this case your GF will in no way affect her Mum and Dad. if No DLA is in place (make a claim) then only HB/CTB are affected|`|HUrYSp4oaa	from my experience as a carer and being on income support with a daughter working i dont think it will alter the income support or the carers allowance.  it may affect the counciil tax benefit and housing benefit as yr ex will have to pay a contribution based on what she is earning. their personal benefits will not be affected by their daugghter living at home.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	The Carer's Allowance that her father is receiving won't change because that is just dependent on how many hours he works/cares for his wife. Any household income-based benefits such as Income Support will be affected though so it's best to tell all relevent authorities just in case it has an impact - the Job Centre (DWP), HM Revenue & Customs and the Council if they are recieving Council Tax benefit (which is automatic if they're getting Income Support.)|`|tADSxyqwaa	they will take it into account as household income - her family must declare her income and how much she pays into the "pot" they might take some of this off her parents but i dont think they'd take it all cos they factor in her causing more household costs as well|`|ngmquMZbaa	Yes..of course it will..   They will take away the amount they think the third person should contribute to the cost of running the house...
I1VivZxfaa	I can train you for a fee.  But I'm sure it will be cheaper to try to find multiple books.<br>  <br>  Each topic is in itself very extensive.  If you are going to do project management, then understand project management first.<br>  <br>  If you understand this, then figure out what product you will be managing (eg. are you working for a vendor?).  If you are working for a bank, then you should focus on understanding what type of derivatives and the process of derivatives from initial trade order, entry, submission, execution, clearing, settlement (which is sort of STP - but not really, b/c u need to continue the process to the very end and also include supporting processes such as market risk).|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	get a book i dont think anyone has time to write all this info out
DAMZKbpDaa	The IRS hires many data-processing temp employees during tax time. They just type in the numbers, they don't do any "human reviewing." <br>  <br>  The computer flags things for review, either from electronic submissions or paper submissions that these data processing people type in. The computer does not favor one form of filing over another.<br>  <br>  The probability is it won't be reviewed (and that's a good thing). The date they showed you is an estimate, but usually reliable. (This year there has been problems with it, however)|`|MvC6n3DWaa	They generally are within the guidelines outlined online. They tell to allow 6 weeks and that is the norm. I received mine, filed in the same manner, in 4 weeks.|`|cI6QCxWyaa	Out of curiosity when did you mail your return?|`|AA11284831	When you file a paper return it does NOT get a "human review" any faster than if you e-file.  Paper returns are punched in to the IRS computer system by data entry drones who know little if anything about the Tax Code.  Their ONLY function is to key in the data.  Once your return is keyed in the actual processing starts.  The computer will then decide if it gets kicked out for review by a human.<br>  <br>  The IRS is verifying entitlement for the FTHB credit.  Some property transfer records are readily available to the IRS while others are not.  If they cannot independently verify entitlement they are requesting proof directly from the taxpayer, such as copies of the HUD-1 settlement sheet or copies of the recorded deed showing the date of transfer of title to the new owner.

7HKTDcvYaa	You should keep in a savings account enough money to last at your current spending rate about 6 months.<br>  After you  have that amount in savings you should put the next 6 months into short term investments like CD or GIC. This means you are making a target to keep a year of spending in liquid assets and nearly liquid assets.<br>  The precise amount that you keep in that nearly liquid assets is not urgent if you make a point to always ensure they are recoverable within 6 months.<br>  <br>  The objective here is to make sure you will never need to run a balance on a credit card. No point in planning an investment strategy with a credit card balance growing.<br>  <br>  Beyond that first year of spending cushion, you will need to plan for spending or lower income periods that are predictable. You do not want to launch into investing just months before you go to University or you plan to buy a house. Never invest on a long term basis money you expect to need within a 2 year horizon.   <br>  <br>  You should know a good deal about companies, their financial statements, their practices of debt management etc before you start to invest in stocks. You also need to know that prices of stocks often move in directions and degree that are not readily predicted, and are not based on good economic theory.<br>  <br>  Yet you need to understand the economic theory that gives you at least some chance to invest wisely. Most company stocks move up and down with market sentiment, but economics do influence the individual company as well as the market.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Start with a simple savings account or money-market account at your bank.<br>  <br>  A couple of great books to read are "Personal Finance For Dummies" and "Investing For Dummies."

However, you probably can't do that unless you're coming to the table with a big down payment, because otherwise you won't have any equity, and therefore you won't qualify for either of these types of loans.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	No. That would not be allowed.

lzEuuseJaa	You should ask your uncle. One of my relatives is a well-known producer, he hires other well-known producer's and director's kids as interns. That's the way it works, they hire each other's relatives. Your uncle may be able to help you find a job, or he might know someone who can. If you don't need to be paid, even better. Write up a good resume, be professional when you ask your uncle. He should be able to give you a couple of names to call and ask.<br>  <br>  Intern jobs are very hard to find. Usually the studios want college students who will receive credit for interning. All the high school age kids I know who are interns got the jobs through connections, or through a local high school work program. My son is going to work as an assistant to an assistant (he's going to be 14 at that time) to a producer. He made his pitch very professionally, he's an excellent typist, knows all the software, good on the phones, quick thinker, knows where to find what's needed, and has knowledge of movie production from time on the set, so he's familiar with the terms, who people are, etc. So don't just ask your uncle if he can make a call for you for a job, make it specific and do a great pitch about why you are qualified. If you're a good student, you've got enough to use.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Maybe before you quite you should look for another one that is part time?|`|ft8t98Pnaa	lets see... the economy sucks right now.... so id say quitting your job would be a stupid decision. who knows when you are going to find another one... why dont you start looking for another job... and once you find one. that you know you are hired for.. then you quit your job at kmart|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	be smart here, wait until they fire you so you can claim unemployment.  don't quit...they can deny your claim.  but just come in late & do what you want to piss them off.  you win either way & you'll have extra money for gas & stuff you want.
tmh42R6Caa	First of all, you cannot be discriminated against because of your handicap.  A company would have to argue that catering to your needs would cause an undue hardship to the company in order to not hire you.  I don't believe speech recognition software would be an undue hardship on anyone.  <br>  <br>  However, if you really don't WANT a job that requires typing you could possibly try retail management.  I worked in retail management when I first graduated and there is very little computer work involved.  Good luck!!
WuMS5NmUaa	Converting APR To APY<br>  <br>  These instructions will set up Excel to convert an APR value into an APY value, useful for evaluating how much you’re really paying on a credit card.<br>  <br>  In cell A1, type APR<br>  In cell A2, type # times a year<br>  In cell A3, type APY<br>  In cell B3, type =(1+B1/B2)^B2-1<br>  <br>  Now, type your desired APR value into cell B1 and the number of times a year the interest is compounded into B2 (most of the time for a credit card it’s daily, so you’d type in 365). The APY will appear in B3. You may need to set B3 to have the “percentage” data format; just right click on B3, choose “Format Cell…” and then choose “Percentage” in that box.<br>  <br>  These instructions should help you really understand what bank account offers and credit card offers really mean and how you can get them on the same terms.<br>  <br>  Cheers.
laVGEEeraa	Contact the Homeowners Association for the community, they should be able to answer all of these questions, with the exception of the new shopping area.  For that contact City Hall and see if the contractors are still operating (with the economic downturn they may have halted production if the bank(s) are restricting their credit or if other costs have risen beyond their original projections).<br>  If you have looked at any property for sale there, if the Homeowners Association's address/phone number are not listed on the prospectus, then ask the selling real estate agent; they would be very happy to provide it if it meant a possible sale (and them getting a commission).

z0XRuVwSaa	yes its 30 quid a week if u go to collage full time and ur parents earnings are low and up to 500 quid bonus ..|`|HclZKkMVaa	is a complete and utter waste and disregard for tax payer's money. I turn up to college and get paid absolutely nothing, and you know something? I think everybody should. Further education is a choice. People shouldn't be bribed with money to show up.|`|p5kzRDIpaa	what about it?
XZpaN95Faa	This is completely dependant on what your credit looks like.  If you have a high credit score across all three reporting agencies, you are likely to get a very low rate, but if you have had issues in the past several years on your credit report, you are likely to get a high interest rate.<br>  <br>  I had issues several years ago and I am currently paying around 6% interest on my car - if this helps any.  <br>  <br>  Also, you will need provable income.  They will not consider you even if you have a large down payment if you do not have provable income.  If you do not claim any income, this could be an issue.<br>  <br>  Here is my advice:<br>  Go to YOUR bank first and talk to them.  This will prevent you from having to deal with a car dealer before you know...|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Without verifiable income, you'll have trouble getting any loan.|`|4d1d61e8ee76ab95bb8d2c7a9badfe1daa	dont get into trouble and penalties - if you get paid in cash you still have to report income. I suspect you may not owe much tax. File a sch c for 2008 as step one. <br>  <br>  once that is done you may qualify for a low even 0 percent.|`|DibzbnVhaa	Your credit should be good enough for you to be able to finance the car for a lower interest rate; however, the fact that you do not claim any income might prevent you from getting any loans. Income is a big part in the bank's decision when deciding your credit risk.|`|24kFbAdsaa	Without any way to verify your income, you may have trouble financing the car.  You can't show a debt to income ratio - a number they use to determine if you can make the monthly payments.

c3429f030d6618b08371c4582520cf19aa	Interest is the stated rate or coupon rate that the bond pays yield is the combination of this plus the price you paid for the bond this determines yield. If you pay less than par for the bond that enhances the yield becasue the bond will be redeemed at par thereby making you an additional profit on top of the interest paid the opposite is true if you pay over par.<br>  <br>  Dividends are only paid on stocks not bonds.
yO5tm6e1aa	That's correct.  Inside your branch office, near the entrance to the rope lines for the tellers, should be a desk to fill out deposit and withdrawal slips.  Pick up the withdrawal slip and fill it in with your savings account number.  Wait to sign it until you're in front of the teller that's going to make the transaction for you.<br>  <br>  You should bring a picture ID and expect to show it to the teller.
AA10097817	I judge a bar by its cleanliness and lack of smoke. I won't go back to a bar that is dirty or smokey. Especially in the bathroom(s)!. Clean the windows. Shine the mirrors. SCRUB THE FLOOR and under the tables. I mean where people stick their gum. If a place looks run down and neglected, patrons feel you don't care, so why should they? They won't come back.<br>  <br>  I realize the smokey part could be a problem in some parts of the world, but in my town it isn't.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Check the liquor laws regarding food; some states view it as an enticement.  If OK, how about salted peanuts in the shell?  Let customers throw the shells on the floor.  Just sweep up at night.  Simple & cheap.<br>  Guys show up in droves where there are gals.  Have a Ladies Night.  Have a Nurses/Secretary Night.<br>  Or emphasize it's a man's bar; guys hideaway from women.  Have pool, darts, shuffleboard.  Have tournaments.  Let the guys cuss, spit, scratch their butts & tell tale tales.<br>  Not to question your morality but what's your appearance?  Dressed attractively?  Don't have to be all made up but don't look like you just threw some rags on.  Not that you have to dress like a Hooters girl, but remember no one goes there for the food!  A little cleavage, tight jeans or sweater won't hurt your tips or traffic.<br>  Remember to always have fun.  Don't cop an attitude no matter how bad your day was.  Leave PMS at the door.  If the guys want to hear bitching, they can go home for that.  Joke, flirt & enjoy.|`|85458c6d6b43aa2c656b983aafc206aaaa	Maybe you could host a series of events? Don't you do sports nights? Free t-shirts or promos that are cost effective yet advertise when they use it. <br>  Figure out obscure holidays or local companies with a large employee base & make it a reason for people to gather. Just a few party supplies in various colors can spice it up.<br>  Be careful bringing in food, there are health dept. codes you may not be aware of but packaged snacks should be okay, ask the manager.<br>  Good luck!!<br>  PS--make a Facebook fan page too & connect with locals online!!
