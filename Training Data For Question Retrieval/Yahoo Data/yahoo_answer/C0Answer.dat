AjFA8qIxaa	Wow, Graham H, way to go, jerk.    To answer the question, a some soldiers in the army are actually in because they were caught commiting a felony and were given the option jail or army. Sad but true. Go to your local recruiter and ask him. It really depends on what kind of felonies they were, how old you were and so on. And don"t expect a great job.  And you might also be sent to one of the nonpleasant bases outthere ( read Alaska..lol)|`|iDUg2v7Faa	Depends heavily on the nature of the felonies as well as how long ago they happened. Ironically violent crimes make it more difficult to get in. Crimes such as an Armed Robbery would also worsen your chances. If the army doesn't take you, waiting a bit or trying another branch is always an idea.|`|0lWB2SUwaa	Maybe,     go see a recruiter|`|rlmdQRFYaa	The amount of felonies accumulated is the number of times you have won at the game of life and therefore, the Army wants to see that on your record. Two might even be enough to automatically qualify you for Army Rangers.

lHDff8Braa	Obviously, you have no understanding what tax evasion is.    Daschle didn't "evade" his taxes.  He DID pay taxes!  He just didn't pay enough, and the IRS has in its regulations things people have to do when they don't pay enough.  They have to pay in full, with interest and penalties.    And Daschle did that now too, so in the eyes of the IRS, he's done nothing wrong.    Sorry, you lose.|`|TsjqzanQaa	The law doesn't apply to politicians who have cronies the way that it applies to you and I, obviously.    There is no such thing in the United States as "equal justice under law," as politicians get away with things like this all of the time, and cover up for each other.    Bush should be prosecuted for international crimes, such as holding prisoners on foreign soil without due process, and torturing them.    But politicians seem to be, as always, above the law.    The exception comes with politicians like Blagojevich, who don't have the cronies that others do, and then they're thrown to the wolves.|`|AA10751775	Yes|`|0ixBWT6Xaa	I'd like ALL politicians to take a relook at their taxes, I bet pretty much all of them would "find" mistakes they made.

And then see where the worlds estates come to, see if theres an all out war by then, or if the end of the world and antichrist have come, and then see about joining the military at a better benefits & pay rate, as officer.  But who knows, the world might be in calamity when you get your degree, and the war could be worse.  So just + for being not in the army in 4-5 years.  Just take one bridge at a time, and think about it later.  Or, you could even go into ROTC in college, if you are a US Citizen.  (thats on the side).      I know some lieutenants that had done ROTC, and they seem like they have their head on straight.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	You will need college to get into the air force. You don't necessarily have to finish it but you will need some college.|`|MZFpRxDEaa	i say both, so you get money to go to college, but only if you want to be in the Air force|`|kbz5S3waaa	I say college, then the AF as an officer - a whole lot more money that way.|`|v6l3o2kvaa	You can always do Air National Guard and have your college paid for.  You get the best of 2 worlds, and also do ROTC and become an officer, you always have more options than 1 or the other,|`|8b53e713d584ea5dc9761aeed373f037aa	I am sure the air force has an option of doing college while you serve or they may even have a "college first" type program in which you go to school for x number of years and then give the Air Force x number of years in return. I agree with a previous poster who said to go Officer but I would talk to a recruiter and see if maybe they have an equivalent to the Army's Green-to-Gold program.

Also I doubt your emancipated so at 16 she still has say over what you do. Unless you emancipate yourself, there's not much you can do. Just reason with her.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	You are not 18, so you have no rights.|`|PI1S0PLUaa	I am sure you do not work "all" the time. And this is just an immature argument on your part. Grow up. There is more to life than your tv, cell phone, ipod and computer. And if you want to look at it logically, say she can't take your phone because it is "your" phone. How much do you depend on the things which are not "your" stuff? I would guess these are a few:  The house you live in, the car you drive in, the food you eat, the bed you sleep in, the clothes you wear, the shoes you wear, the tv you watch, jewelry you wear, etc...    See my point? How much does your life suck now? So grow up and realize you are most likely in the wrong which is why she wants to take it from you.|`|MZFpRxDEaa	well it depends on who's plan its on|`|FLLVtAdEaa	You need to be 18 to have a cell phone contract, so I'm sure the phone isn't in your name.

Yes, you are under the control of your parents, and your mother can take the phone.     Just stop and think about this - you say  YOU paid with YOUR money. So your mother pays the rent, the cable, the food bill, probably buys you clothes - just how much do you actually contribute? If you had to pay  your fair share, would you HAVE any money for a phone? No, I didn't think so.|`|H8MGismEaa	Yes ; but rather than fight your mom who looks out for your best interest , try to convince her that you need it for safety reasons and to check in with her .

AA11494150	First of all, are you talking about a stun gun, or a taser? A stun gun has fixed probes, the taser shoots the probes from a distance. A taser is much more effective because it can immobilize the attacker. A stun gun just delivers pain.     The extra voltage may cause a more intense pain, but will not incapacitate them any longer. Electricity does not store in your body, so as soon as the source is removed, there are no lasting effects.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	You'll get fried even more|`|a772ac727655daef254b8e6748f36d1faa	about 50,000 volts|`|kEZP3BmBaa	Well the 100k volt leaves them down on the ground.

Likewise, trendy styles that result in shaved  portions of the scalp (other than the neckline) or designs cut into the hair are prohibited. Females may wear braids and  cornrows as long as the braided style is conservative, the braids and cornrows lie snugly on the head, and any hairholding  devices comply with the standards in 18a(3)(d) below. Dreadlocks (unkempt, twisted, matted individual parts  of hair) are prohibited in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty. Hair will not fall over the eyebrows or extend below  the bottom edge of the collar at any time during normal activity or when standing in formation.

l4rFmqnAaa	Between 1970 and 1975 many states did lower the minimum drinking age to 18 -20. Then research was done on the impact the lower drinking age had on society (primarily traffic accidents & deaths). With that research, citizen advocacy groups started urging changes to the law that would raise the age one could drink legally. In 1984, the federal government enacted the Uniform Drinking Act which mandated reduced federal transportation funds to those states that did not raise the minimum legal drinking age to 21. Since then, all states raised their drinking age

VKrePQZqaa	The president leads the executive branch of the federal government; his role is to execute the law as created by the Congress, in accordance with the Constitution of the United States. Article II of the Constitution establishes the president as commander-in-chief of the armed forces and enumerates powers specifically granted to the president, including the power to sign into law or veto bills passed by both houses of the Congress. The president also has the power to create a Cabinet of advisers and to grant pardons or reprieves. Finally, with the "advice and consent" of the Senate, the president is empowered to make treaties and appoint federal officers, ambassadors, and federal judges, including justices of the Supreme Court. As with officials in the other branches of the United States government, the Constitution restrains the president with a set of checks and balances designed to prevent any individual or group from taking absolute power.

However, there is some things you can do.    First, change your deductions on your W-4 so that you end up with as small a refund as possible. No sense in giving the government an interete free loan.    Next, you could pay your tax bill by going down to the IRS office and dropping the whole amount off to them in cash, preferably in pennies. I heard about one guy that paid his tax bill by writing a check out on a shirt (since they took the shirt off of his back). As long as you have all the info needed for a check (routing number, account number, etc) it does not HAVE to be on check stock paper.    Another idea is to send in your return (if you still mail it) using a US flag stamp placed upside down. The upside down flag is a sign of distress.    I am sure there are a lot of other creative things that can be done as well. Just use a little imagination.

6FpUuLknaa	You'd have to be born in Great Britain and then knighted by the Queen.|`|FLLVtAdEaa	First of all, you're talking about a prefix, not a suffix.    You can't legally add a prefix to your name. But you can use whatever prefix you want.|`|azypqsphaa	prefix|`|AA10789216	Here in the United States, we abolished all titles of nobility.  This prevents anyone from thinking they are better than anyone else because of belonging to a priviledged class.      Ask America's founding fathers what they thought of people who called themselves nobility.  The French killed them all.      Did that shrink your ego?|`|eulMjLtPaa	Perhaps you are speaking of a prefix, although in this case it wouldn't be one, since you're talking about a separate word.      You can call yourself anything you want.  You can legally change your name to Sir Erik Whatever.      There are self-help areas of your particular state government site that will give you information how to do it.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	You go to court same as anyone else who wants to change their name, persuade them your reason is not frivolous or fraudulent and there you go.    But, maybe I am getting old, but don't they still teach in 4th grade that "suffix" means "after" and "prefix" means "before"? With reasoning like you are already showing, you are going to have an uphill battle.|`|bqdeD8JHaa	I believe that title can only be granted by being knighted, so you should speak with the Queen about that.|`|R5f4MjZcaa	The same way you would do any name change, except if you are thinking it would make you sound like royalty, then guess again.

Call a vote for them a waste of vote.|`|AA10789216	When a political party abandons its values in search of power, then it disenfranchises its members who then leave the party in search of one that upholds their values.  I see this happening in both Democratic and Republican parties.  The Republican leadership is becoming like Democrats, and the Democrat leaders are becoming Socialists.      Our founding fathers warned us against political parties because the parties become focused on power instead of principles.  Now we see they were right.  That is what happened.|`|stEUrlwjaa	I would feel great.  Let us start with electoral reform.  Quite often we see not the best but the richest being elected at all levels.  Sometimes we think that our elected official is a crook, but he is our crook and we know what to expect from him.  When the importance of money in election campaigns will be reduced to minimum than we will have different types of candidates, better selection and even the possibility of the third, forth and whatever number of parties.|`|AA11847612	I'd love it.

But all we have are Dems and Repubs.|`|AA10124897	If there were a competent candidate... Ron Paul and Ralph Nader both aren't what I would vote for.      Right now, the Democrats are shooting themselves in the foot again.  With this spending package we are seeing, it won't be long before once again the Republicans are in control, which would be better for every American if we were there now.      It's sad to see them snub their noses at history and go forward with something we all know will be a disaster.    With the Congressional Republicans standing strong, and hopefully the Senate Republicans will do the same... We will show the country again who the better party for economic growth and prosperity is....|`|C3Jl1ytPaa	It would be fine as long as it's even more Conservative than the Republican party and actually strong enough to win elections that's the problem with the 3rd parties they don't have the strength to win at high levels I agree with alot of Libertarian ideas not all of them though but they don't stand a chance of election day so I stick with the Republican party becuase they are the best shot for Conservative values

To answer your question- the "four percent fixed mortgages to qualified homebuyers" is not in the bill. Republican senator Mitch McConnell was proposing it, but as far as we know it hasn't been added yet.     Your relief from the bill will be the following    -$500 per-worker, $1,000 per-couple tax cut for two years  -up to $1500 tax credit for making your home more energy efficient  -if you buy your home between now and july, you dont have to pay back the $7500 tax credit.   -If you are a student you will gain a $2500 tax credit for the next 2 years  - greater access to the $1000 per-child tax credit if you are a parent
dSbAz63baa	We do combat live fire, convoy live fire, squad and partner live fire courses all while on the move and still maintaining accuracy in our shots. and thats just in basic training. In Infantry AIT we do even more advanced training with M16, M4, M203, SAW, M240, 50. cal, claymore, C-4, and the AT4, all of these are also fired at the army basic training no matter what your MOS. And the army Combatives (UAC) is also some of the the best hand to hand combat training you can get anywhere. I am myself a level 2 and planning on going all the way to 4. Also people from other branches need to come to the army to get advanced training. I'm also extremely proud of Rangers, green berets, knowing that theres nothing that can come close to compare to us. So its easy to see the Army is by far the best fighting force in the world which would explain the amount of soldiers being sent to war is much higher because they want to send soldiers that know how to fight over there : )|`|3F8bCZ55aa	The army teaches discipline and one benefit of discipline is the ability to lead.

EWMfigrnaa	NATO name for Soviet short-range nuclear capable missile. Widely distributed to the USSR's clients and used by Egypt in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and Iraq in the Gulf war, when its destabilizing ability to reach Israel led to energetic but rarely successful Scud-hunting by Coalition special forces and aircraft.    The name was derived from:    intr.v., scudded, scudding, scuds.  To run or skim along swiftly and easily: dark clouds scudding by.  Nautical. To run before a gale with little or no sail set.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud    Yahoo'ed it in 5 seconds.

Even if they ask you if you have other coverage you can say no because it will be back dated to the day the divorce was legally finalized by the courts.     He can submit the paperwork while he is there by giving it to his S1 and they can forward it on to the proper person to get you removed. In all honestly I'm really surprised that a judge finalized the divorce while he is overseas in the first place.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Go to the nearest DEERs office with the Divorce decree to get dis-enrolled.

You can update information, but as far as removing yourself you'd have to call the DEERS office and check to be sure.  He can't really do anything over there. He doesn't have the access, nor does he have the time. Its best for you to contact TriCare or Deers yourself and double check. Besides, DEERS won't stop you from getting your own insurance.
AA12044809	Let's play, 'LETS PRETEND'    Let's pretend that you don't care what Phelps does with his life.  You don't pretend to care if he uses heroin, pot, or meth, or anyother drug. Lets also pretend I own a big cereal company. Lets pretend I market my cereal products to kids. Lets pretend I just signed Mr. Phelps to a million dollar contract that allows me to put his picture on my cereal boxes. Lets pretend that Mr. Phelps thinks he's set for life and his family and friends thinks he's cool along with about everyone else that saw Mr. Phelps on the tv.  Also pretend in that contract Mr. Phelps has signed, that it has a detrimental performance clause in the contract.   Pretend I see this picture on the internet showing Mr. Phelps using drugs, which is viewed by millions of people, including children, everyday. Pretend that me, as the owner of a bazillion dollar cereal company, doesn't want to relay any perception with the public that Mr. Phelps is associated with this company because of his drug use. Pretend I invoke the detrimental performance clause of Mr. Phelps contract which states Mr. Phelps must refund any money paid to him and that his contract is immediately terminated.     The same scenerio applies to the mulitple swim wear contracts, swimming equipment contract, tanning lotion contract, marketing appearances contract etc etc. Probably worth in the conservative neighborhood of $10 to $30 million dollars.     You may not give a tinkers d-a-m-n what Phelps just did.  But I bet Mr. Phelps does.     Exit stage right, Mr. Phelps. You'll be remembered as, "Oh yeah, I remember the guy, that was that guy that won those medals at the olympics and then got caught with drugs".|`|lCzBONU1aa	I would only care if he is a hypocrite about it.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	If bonesman ll is allowed to get wasted while president I don't think it's too bad if a young sportsman gets high.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	nope the dude is a dufus anyway    I know people who knew him growing up, the guy is really stupid    and don't be so naive, its a story because he has million dollar endorsements, if he loses them, he won't make any more money|`|WiCjhT95aa	How is this a political question.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Its another pointless story.

Trying to create controversy where there is none.|`|xwxQr4Suaa	I don't understand why the media makes such a damn big deal out of this, it just irritates me.  85-90% (190 million people in the US) of the world uses marijuana, even athletes.  Do I even need to get into what american football athletes do in the off season?  How many of them have been caught?  Why doesn't the media make a big deal out of that?    Point is, why do people look down to people that smoke it just doesn't make sense, so what if you're a world known athlete.  Everyone does it, the media is just making a big deal out of Michael Phelps using marijuana so that they can support the govts law of being illegal.    This whole Michael Phelps thing is just bull crapp and shouldn't be such a big deal.|`|Souvww0maa	Not particularly.  He has worked really hard his entire life.  Taking a break and acting his age once in a while won't kill him.|`|8gXCjxl9aa	I don't still i think drugs are bad for you and still its not if you care its his fan that care and his image.

I get that he's suppose to be a role model and everything, but quite frankly, I don't give a flying ****.|`|XrU1I1wjaa	No. But along with other intrigues such as Jessica Simpson's weight, these stories do their job in distracting the people from the economic calamity that's unfolding before them.|`|CLB32006aa	OMG an athlete who won a record 8 gold medals we love him!

If so, then OK. If not then it is just more of a socialist thing.|`|nmvgZWvpaa	His act of smoking weed in itself is not so bad.. a good deal of americans do it.. however, he is a role model to kids. I'm not going to say he should stop doing it, but just have a lot more digression.|`|DBIKou8faa	No, I don't care.    It's just another example of the media's insatiable hunger to discredit anything that America has to be proud of.  Your last comment hit the nail on the head.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	He's a role model for young people who want to follow in his foot steps. If you are a responsible parent, you would understand what the big deal is.

rHwE5Rkbaa	I don't want to rain on your parade, but I want you to have the best information available.    Yes, you MAY be able to enlist in the Coast Guard with past diagnoses of ADHD - however, right now the Coast Guard recruiters have enough people knocking on our doors that DON'T have medical problems, that our recruiting staff can arbitrarily DQ you just because of the extra paperwork that may be involved in getting you in.  The question is, Why do extra work for one, when there are three that don't require the paperwork that also want to get in??    HOWEVER, if you can get a recruiter to let you take the ASVAB, and you get a VERY good score on it, they may be more willing to talk to you.    Sorry if that's not the news you wanted to hear.|`|AA11117716	After doing some reading on the issue, it seems that you may be able to get in.  As of 2004, persons with ADHD are not automatically disqualified from military service assuming:    - They are not on medication and have not taken medication in the past year.  - They do not show "significant" symptoms of ADHD.    The Coast Guard follows very similar medical criteria for admission as the other armed forces branches, with the DODMERB being the examination method.  Contact your local Coast Guard recruiter to get detailed information on ADHD criteria.  The recruiter will not know this information off the top of his/her head, but they can contact or have you contact a Coast Guard clinic, who will have all the details you need.
Souvww0maa	In a way, yes, it is the fault of the people we have corrupt politicians.  They do not hold their elected officials accountable for their actions.  They only need to see a "D" or an "R" next to a name and they will vote ideology before common sense.    An honest politician however will always be a one-termer.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Many politicians are as honest as they can be.

We chose the system, so any systemic argument ultimately ends up being the peoples responsibilty.    We chose the politicians, so any individual argument ultimately ends up being the peoples responsibility again.    Either way, we the participants in our democracy are ultimately responsible for what we get.    That is why government responsiveness is supposed to be so highly valued.  And in countries like France, Spain, Norway, etc., it is.  But sadly not so much here in the United States.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	The need for realism is now,|`|AA11702773	Look into Ron Paul.    I thought there weren't any, but if he can do it, any of them can.  I now have much higher standards, and we need higher standards, and to vote by them (not just for lessers of evils) or we won't get honest policitians as a general rule.      So in a sense, it is our fault.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	Yes it's  the people's fault. People like Daschle and Geithner get away with crimes because we allow them to. We should be in Washington right now en mass demanding their heads. If you or I didn't pay our taxes the government would be kickin our doors down taking us to jail and seizing our assets but this scum can say they forgot to pay their taxes and they get off. They pay no fines no interest only back taxes. Every individual knows his taxes must be paid. There is no holding anyone to a higher standard for that. "Change" that will make you puke. And the Republicans sit up there in Washington on their sorry asses and let this stuff pass. Be proud America you've elected a crew of absolute thugs.|`|jkr2nyrzaa	See i don't agree with you on here.  Through the media they already choose their dirty crooked politicians, and the people don't care that they already pick 2 people to choose from we just take sides and back up the more Fluent or more personable one.  This is completely wrong.  Look up how the founding fathers got up and ran for pres.  The gameboard has changed completely from then to now.   I try and ask myself this.   If I was full of money and was good with words would I get into politics to further my own personal agendas and how easy would it be to do so?  After looking into this you may find out that most politicians are only politiians because of this reason.   Real good politicians I haven't seen yet, Ron paul, Ralph Nader, Cynthia Mickinney.  THey all have great notions for returning this country back to some founding principles but whos not to say that they are corrupt too.  All of them have been on the politico seen for years and can stand for whatever they stand for.   What we really need is for more people to become interactive in politics and for the ones who really want to see changes, start running for political offices.   If you talk about what most people want to hear you will win.   Thats the problem no politicians talk about what people want until its right around the end when the people finally decide.  To me it seems very complex but when it is broken down it isn't as bad as it seems.  We need to get rid of the duopoly of reps/dems in the house's of gov't, reinstate the full constitution... run localized presidential races were winners from s tates battle for counties, counties battle for region, region battles for states, than from state vs state you end up with pres.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	Ron Paul is honest.

Today's cons would argue that slavery was a "states rights issue."|`|mL1yi935aa	There were people of both parties who were for Slavery.    America was largely a racist country prior to 1865.    Many of the people who were against Slavery were also racist, they did not want blacks in their state.    Even in cities like Philadelphia where there were no slaves, blacks had to sit in a different section than whites when they worshiped at Church.|`|bIDHrOHraa	Ah, yes, another modern Republican supporter who doesn't know their history and likes to   make the "Dems supported slavery argument."    Not to mention you already asked this question before, and I'll explain to you what was explained then.    Check a history book. At the time it was created, the Republicans were the liberal party, while the Democrats were the conservatives.     Later on, they slowly began to switch. The Civil Rights movement led to a split in the Democratic Party. That was why during the Civil Rights movement, a lot of Southern Democrats, or "Dixiecrats" became Republicans.    However, to be fair, there were plenty of racists in both parties. Neither one had too many saints in That was the way America was at the time and for a long time after.     Even people who opposed slavery, both Democrat and Republican, and thought it was wrong were still pretty racist and didn't believe in racial equality. Some only opposed the expansion of slavery into new US territories while not seeing a problem with the existing slavery continuing.    Even after slavery was outlaws people of both parties still opposed expanding black rights. There were anti-slavery Republicans who opposed black suffrage or citizenship.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	There was no Democrat Party at that time. There was Southern Democrats, not quite the same as modern day Democrats.   The Republican party has gone through changes too. And based on the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln's goal was to preseve the Union first and foremost.     "I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be "the Union as it was." ... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that."|`|rttm1SLaaa	Well, technically you're right, I don't think admitting to that says anything about today's Democrats.  And it's not just because that happened about 150 years ago.  The main issue is very simple: political parties change.  You see the south suddenly shift to Republican after the Progressive Era in the early 1900's because there was a massive shift in both parties.  They basically switched sides on a bunch of issues (I'm not saying anything bad about Republicans by saying this either, their policies have nothing to do with slavery and are still vastly different from even the Democrats of the mid 1800's).     Now, you link this up to abortion.  Here's the issue: a slave was an actual human being, fully grown for the most part, and therefore had nothing to distinguish them from the other people of America and in the world beyond their skin color.  Moreover, you're missing another huge point, which is that often the "person's rights" involve their health and livelihoods.  Childbirth can often lead to major medical issues for the mother, and having a child can lead to major economic issues because, like it or not, a child is an economic burden, no matter how much you love and care for it.     I'll explain both my arguments here:  1. When does a mass of cells become a child?  At what point can you make that distinction?  Is it when they become a fetus (chicken embryos look very similar to our fetuses, does that make them human)?  Is it when the brain develops (the point at which abortion becomes illegal)?  Or would you go even further back, and say that the somatic cells (sperm and egg) become human the moment the fuse?  Or beforehand?  If so, what makes them so special?  Don't the stem cells under our skin massively differentiate in the same way as these cells do?  This is the argument I've never understood about when something becomes human.  I haven't heard a single decent argument to tell me when life begins from a pro-life adherent.  If you have a good argument, please tell me it, I've been wanting to actually see one for a while.  2. I would say that, no matter when you believe life begins, the mother's life should always be most important.  If there is a major health risk accompanying the birth, they should have the right to choose.  I also think that the depreciation of their quality of life should be taken into account, since often their quality of life is linked to their child's.  If they don't feel they can support a child, or that if they do they wont be able to support it well, then why should we force them to have it?  What if the child was conceived in a rape?  Should they be forced to have it then?  If you agree there should be certain cases in which abortion is allowable, I would ask what your guideline would be here as well.  Where do you draw the line?  When does a health issue become unimportant, or at what point does a person's quality of life become "good enough"?  Again, I'd love to argue this with someone who can create a good argument.    Larr M is completely ignoring present opinions on each of those issues.  I don't care if all of them are correct, the fact is that's not the Democratic Party today, just as it's not the Republican Party today.|`|jMOzKFmJaa	You have to be realistic and honest when answering this question. The United States initial values were based on Biblical principles. According to Biblical principles if someone is not a Believer in God he could either be killed right away or converted to a slave. There is (was) nothing wrong with it. That is why first American colonists used to exterminate one kind of unbelievers - Red Indians, and to enslave another kind of unbelievers - black pagans from Africa. When it comes to "human rights" of infants it is the same thing - according to Biblical principles an infant younger than 2 years is not consider being "human". That is why killing of such an infant traditionally is not being considered as "murder" (although nowadays it is). For example, Biblical King Herod did not commit murder when he ordered to massacre all infants younger than 2 years at Bethlehem. He knew contemporary laws perfectly well. It was massacre, but not "mass murder". You can make your own conclusion in regard to abortion and allege "human rights" of unborn foetuses based on these Biblical principles. But now we leave in a new society that enforces new principles which have nothing to do with Christian traditions. So, would it be fair to blame Democrats who lived 150 years ago when situation was very different?
CM1dfztQaa	I was in the Air Force for 4 years, and can tell you that the higher you score on the asvab the easier it will be to get the job title you want. Right now everyone is looking for recruits, but the Air Force is the most stringent about test scores.     Don't let that freak you out. the asvab is similar to taking sat's, but a little more technical info is on it. At least thats how it was when I joined. You may be able to find books on what to expect. Try Amazon.com and go under text books.    Air Force BT is not as physical as the Army or the Marines, but you will get up every morning to revely, @ o-dark-hundred for PT (physical training), then have approx. 2-3 mins to shower, another 2-3 mins to dress and line up for chow. Chow goes pretty quick and your off to the days training.    Halfway thru day you stop training for lunch, and @ about 5pm you'll eat dinner. When the traing day is done your flight will go back to the dorms (the Air Force doesn't call them barracks), clean-up, make sure everything is put where it's supposed to be and prepare to hit the sack.    You will have to be able to run at least 1 1/2 miles to graduate, there will be some M16 training (try to at least qualify), and try not to freak out during gas mask training, Everyone has clear sinuses when it's over.    It can be fun if you keep in mind it's training/a mind game, and it will be over in 6 weeks. Also, they call it a dream sheet for a reason (you'll figure it out) you may have better luck if you list the places you don't want to go.    Good luck in your future.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Air Force is probably the easiest branch to get into lol|`|ApFh12Sqaa	Air Force is The Hardest To Get Into, But As Long As You Dont Have and Legal and Financial Trouble Looming You Should Be Good.    As Far As Advice, Just Study, Eat Healthy, Exercise and Drink Water|`|4cfee734accabf2cf33df95b41ee32d5aa	The Air Force is definitely not the easiest service to get in to.  The reason?  They don't need nearly as many people as the other services do.  Just talk to the recruiter and you will find out what jobs are available and how long you may have to wait.  As for the ASVAB, pick up a study guide before you test.  If you don't score well on it, take it again.  I took mine in 11th and 12th grade.    To get ready for basic training just start exercising now.  Running, push-ups, sit-ups, etc..  That will help you.|`|kCwhs8Reaa	Congrats Brother!! I give a lot of respect to anyone in the military, no matter the branch. They will all be hard. The difficulty will depend on what field you would like to go into (i.e. pilot, mechanic, load master, Special forces, or things like accounting, logistics, etc .....) If you go to the Air Force web site or any military web site, like  AF Reserves or the Nat'l Guard, or just google fitness requirements; they will usually give you a list of different qual times you will need to meet.  The best way to get ready is to eat healthy, drink A LOT of water, get really good at push-ups & sit-ups, as well as running a few miles at a time. These are timed in basic training.  As far as the ASVAB, there are practice tests online and well as books at Barnes-and- Noble for it as well as the AFOQT is you plan to become an officer.  Good luck and I wish you all the luck! Keep me posted!|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	The AF has always been the most difficult of the services to join.  It's true, they aren't hurting for folks-but depending your skill set, and what career field you're interested in shouldn't be a  problem.  The ASVAB is a standardized multiple-choice test.  Not unlike the ACT/SAT.  Test strategies you probably already know apply here as well.  Prepping for BMT is simply to find the physical fitness standards (you can get these online or from a recruiter), then working out until you can easily get the maximum score.  "Just passing" is not enough.  Your physical fitness will also help you in getting through the first couple weeks: what with the sleep deprivation, and disorientation.|`|m5J36D28aa	Don't listen to rumors, let the Air Force tell you whether its hard to get into.|`|njZ76h6Naa	were at war. how hard can it be,  go in!!!!  inte the xchair force.

The problem is that so many of the people who are complaining about the "socialist" programs of our government obviously won't go back to the European countries from which their ancestors came because the social programs are even more extensive in those countries.|`|grKtTRYtaa	This is a glorious video;  everyone should look at it.    I agree with the premise;  go away if you don't like us.  I am not sure that is our problem.  Our problem seems to be that illegals like us too much, want to come, and stay.  I know the problem well, living 10 miles from Mexico all my life.  Their living situation in MX is horrid so I would probably come over too.    Still, it is illegal and we can't take everybody.  Janet Nepolitano, Homestead Security Chief, has told illegal criminal aliens to go home, hadn't heard that from anybody previously.    There is a new government program to check on all new hires, required if you deal with Feds and who doesn't?  It is called E-Verify.  The employer can go to website with ss  and other info and see if job applicant is legal.  Even their photo and previous employers come up!  My relative in personnel found 42 people using the same SS .  Also, 1 applicant said that the ss   was his, etc..  My relative said, "This isn't your photo."  It wasn't.    Since he has his own personnel agency, the govt. checks him more carefully than most.  The only drawback as far as I can tell is mistakes, but there is a way to correct these.    Technology is helping.
Jn7bt3JTaa	Because it's easy.    I'm really not sure if your issue is with stereo types or Religion. If you could specify what exactly you want answered I will give it a try.    Okay, religious aspect: Different religions vary in their beliefs. But Regardless of  of religion, worship, deity, messiah, or ritual; all religions agree on some very basic things:    Marriage   Children   Raising children in safety and health   Teaching children the ways of the culture  Work ethic  Nationalism - Pride in the country they live in.  Finding and or approving of a spouse for their children.    These could be considered republican beliefs but, really it a cross culture conservatism. There is an instinct to preserve Ones culture, religion and way of life through ones children.     The political aspect is just this, politicians will tell people whatever they think the people want to hear to get elected. almost 100% of the time, that means an emphasis on family values.      That's the long and short of it.|`|ClGxicdsaa	Well, it's mostly true.  Most good Christians give their own money away to the poor instead of promoting more government sponsored stealing from the successful.  Also, most Christians promote the right to life instead of this never ending Holocaust called abortion that liberals enjoy.  Most Christians have a strong sense of personal responsibility (republican).  I have a hard time figuring out how abortion itself doesn't keep all Christians on the conservative side.  I mean, you like more redistribution because that's worth this Holocaust?  Doesn't make sense to me.|`|AA11166769	It's because the likes of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are the ones who get all the press.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	Right wing Christians and fundamentalists tend to be republican.

Ln5XNno3aa	He will get BAH Basic Allowance for Housing, as a E-1 he won't get much. I'll break it down for you. I am married and while in Colorado Springs as a E-5 my BAH was $1088 per month, I lived in a 3 bedroom appt that cost $815 per month, so I had some cash left over for utilities and such. It is up to you while living off post to find a place within your price range, if you have a $800 Appt. and the BAH for a E-1 happens to be $600 you will have to pay the additional $200 out of pocket. My advice is to weight the pros and cons of living both on-post,and off post, and see which one benefits you most.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Since you are married then yes, he should receive BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing).  The rate varies depending on where he is stationed.  And it increases as he gets promoted.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	Is he on active duty or is he reserves or National Guard? If he's active duty he will get BAH based on his rank and duty station zip code at the with dependant rate since he is married.     If he is reserves or NG he will not get BAH unless he is activated or on active status. If he is acviated he will oget it based on his rank and the location of his dependents.|`|ApFh12Sqaa	Yes You Will Get BAH, The Amount Is Depending On Where he is Stationed.|`|vUiUoamVaa	Yes, but how much you get also depends on where he is stationed.  Off-post housing is going to be expensive simply because there are so many people wanting off-post housing and there is a limited supply of housing.      As an E-1, he has enough expenses already...sounds like he is still in training, too.  If he is in training, he will be stuck on the base with little or no time to visit you.  Wait until he gets his first permanent duty assignment and then think about it.  It is probably better to stay where you are for the time being.  When he makes higher rank, moving there and getting affordable housing will be more likely.    Contact the Army Community Service office at the nearest base to learn more about if affordable housing is even available where he is stationed.  It's a free service and they are pretty darn good at helping and giving useful advice.|`|jTJOFRaRaa	Yes, since you two are married, you can choose to live off post.  You will receive BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing), which varies based on your rank and location.  Go to http://www.military.com/benefits/militar...  to see what your BAH rates will be.      BAH is supposed to cover all of your living expenses, but it usually doesn't.  For example, my DH and I bought a house last year.  BAH covers our mortgage, but we're on our own for utilities.|`|zhH36xEHaa	If you're married, or an NCO, or if there is no room in the barracks for new soldiers and you're senior in your barracks|`|AA12215630	You will receive BAH for housing. This all depends on rank and time in grade and where hubby is stationed at. Check this site to see what your BAH would be:  http://perdiem.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem...    By the time he gets to his first duty station he should be E2 so I would look that up instead of E1.
AA11206283	uh...the guy who did it.    Occasionally you can get some help in some states from a victim's fund|`|N7G26k4Iaa	No one.  You can try and recover your losses from the person who defrauded you but the government certainly does not pay you.|`|IMENWksEaa	That is a good question. I have wondered about that too. Not much justice for the victim. Strange though, how the court sets bail money for the criminal, if someone comes along to bail them out, then the court usually keeps the money with none of it going to repay the victim. Also when an offender is fined for something and if there is a victim involved in the case, none goes to the victim automatically, the court usually keeps the money. The victim is the one that most likely pays, or must try to resolve it themselves in court, while paying a lawyer.Then even if they get a judgment in their favor, it doesn't mean they can collect all that is owed to them.

ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	You and several zillion other people want to come to Canada.     Sorry, we're full now as it is. We already have thousands of our own citizens who have degrees in economics and who cannot find any jobs. In case you hadn't heard, Canada is experiencing a recession and it isn't getting any better. What jobs we have will go to our own citizens before foreigners. Sorry, that's the way it is here and everywhere else.    Buuuuut...if you are determined to come and study here, you would have to apply to a university here and get accepted by that university first. Then, when you get a letter of acceptance, you submit it to Canadian immigration officials and apply for a student visa.     Be warned that foreign students pay at least twice the tuition that Canadian students pay because the government subsidizes our own citizens' education. You would also have to purchase your own health care insurance as foreigners would not qualify for any provincial health care services. You will have to prove that you have sufficient funds to pay your living expenses, such as food, rent, transportation and so on. You would also have to satisfy immigration officials that you would return to your own country once your studies are complete. Oh, and you wouldn't qualify for any student financial assistance either.    Sorry if it sounds harsh but I wouldn't want you to be disappointed if you simply tried to come to Canada only to be told 'no' by immigration officials.    My advice? Stay where you are and go to school there. Maybe by the time you've completed your degree, the economy might be in a better position to facilitate your hoped-for move here.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	do you want to study in Canada?   if yes, then you just have ENOUGH money to support yourself - including fees and health care - for the 4 years of the course (degree). if you dont have the money then you will not be allowed to enter.   Everything that Z said is true.      Ocne you have the degree - if you get it elsewhere - then you must work for a year or two to get experience before you can apply to Canada. Then you can apply as a skilled worker. That takes at least 2 years or more to be processed.     So you will have to be patient - it is a LONG process.|`|66Yp9PVcaa	Go to Canadian website (www.gic.gc.ca) they will tell you everything . this is government site|`|ZpZEILUMaa	i am not

The custodial parent gets to claim the deduction because they also have to claim the child support payments as income.  Thus, it balances out.|`|HeoS75kGaa	RAC is mostly right.  Consider... the IRS gets a tax return from the custodial parent, claiming the kid as a dependent.  The IRS also gets a tax return from the non-custodial parent claiming the kid as a dependent.  Think there's a good chance of an audit?  Maybe not, who knows?    But if there is, the IRS is going to want evidence of who provides 51% or more of the child's dependent care.  In most cases, it's going to be the custodial parent, since it's doubtful that your child support pays for the rent.  On the other hand, if the divorce settlement required you to keep making the house payments so your ex-spouse and kid can live there, while you rent another place to live, then you probably do provide more than 50% of the kid's expenses.    For the second part of your question, save yourself the audit.  The IRS will never accept child support payment as child care.  If you've been ordered by the court to pay for daycare, you might have some legitimacy, but you'll want to talk to a tax counselor about that one.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	You do NOT get to claim the child simply because you are paying child support and you do NOT get to write off child support payments.  The person receiving child support payments does NOT claim the money as income.  If you have a divorce decree it should state who claims the child on taxes.  If a divorce decree is not relevant in the situation then it falls upon IRS rules stating whoever the child resided with for the majority of the tax year. And I will agree the whole thing sucks!|`|CdBdP2ymaa	No...but the support is.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	I'm not an accountant but logic would dictate that if you are supporting a child you should be able to claim them as a dependent.

If they are in breach of the lease or rental agreement, you will have to file in court to have them evicted.  Most tenants are savvy about their rights.

For landlord/tenant rights, check out the link below.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	I dont understand the exact question..but only a judge can order an eviction by the sherrif. usually after the 72 hour (3 day) notice is posted and you do not vacate, you have to go to eviction court.  if your landlord does not take you to court..then you cannot be evicted..if the landlord calls the cops so they can remove you..the cops will simply ask to see the judge's eviction.

This appearance is made worse by the Republicans lying and ranting and raving about how evil it is not to pay your taxes, and that anytime anyone doesn't pay their taxes they should immediately resign from any government job.     It is because of the Republican noise machine that it would be impossible for there to be communication between the parties that they have withdrawn their name from consideration.

You would get something in the mail saying to pay it or go to jail.  You aren't important enough for the Feds to come knocking.  $500 is a spit in the ocean, pal.

There are spending increases planned but they are in direct response to economic stimulant plans.

Why would 'Dimm'-witted constipatives want to raise taxes?    Oh, I get it.

It's not "raising taxes" if you call it something else.|`|kDj5zUXoaa	This is what the DIMMS want....  This is not for our infrastructure...  Much of economic stimulus plan seems aimed at minorities.    $16 Billion for Public Housing.  $6 Billion for low income home owners.  $120 Billion for public schools, with $41 Billion earmarked for specific districts.  $15.6 Billion for need based college scholarships (need-based = no whites allowed).  $87 Billion for medicaid (the fund that is broke from paying for illegal aliens).  $10 Billion for public transportation (you know the buses whites are afraid to get on).  $31 Billion to modernize public buildings (this worked so well in Detroit).  $2.9 Billion earmarked exclusively for American Indians.    We are told that $140 Billion is going to cut cuts. However by tax cuts they are including increasing the child tax credit. The child tax credit actually increases welfare spending. When a welfare queen with four kids pays no taxes all year and then gets a fat check from the IRS for $4,000, it is called a refund instead of more welfare. Even though the recipient paid $0 in taxes. So part of the $140 Billion in tax cuts is actually more welfare spending.    Obamas economic adviser Robert Reich demand that the money go to unskilled minorities, and that white males be left out. Reich has defended by his comments despite a public outrage.|`|SFnxkS3Raa	"Dimms" wanna shift the Bush tax cuts from the rich to the rest of us.|`|Oh9oFiriaa	typical dem   do as i say, not as i do|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	Democrats love to sound off about helping the country.

e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	I concur with the first two answerers. It increased the power and influence of the federal government by leaps and bounds, especially in economic/business affairs, like no other time in US history. It was revolutionary, but not in a good way, it was very destructive to individual liberty, free markets, and federalism (it shifted more power away from state governments to the central government).    FDR also set in motion our current Welfare State. Right now, 53% of the federal budget is consumed by Social Security (FDR's dismal creation), Medicaid and Medicare (created under Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" which was basically the New Deal II and Johnson was an FDR clone). 53%!!! That's $1.45 Trillion that the federal government has no place messing with as according to the US Constitution. Image what tax payers could do with and how well our economy would do if that $1.45 Trillion was returned to us. We wouldn't need no pathetic, pork laden, phony stimulus bill. Anyway, we can all thank FDR for getting the ball rolling on this big government bureaucratic waste of tax payer dollars.  http://perotcharts.com/category/federal-...     FDR was a scheister, when the Supreme Court struck down several prominent measures of his socialist New Deal, he threatened and tried to expand the Supreme Court so he could stack it with liberal justices that were fond of his socialist New Deal plans. Thankfully his efforts failed to pass in the Senate.     Many prominent economists show that his New Deal programs prolonged the Great Depression by almost 10 years. We had a depression in 1921, but government got out of the way and let the markets correct themselves free of government intervention, and it was very short lived. Unlike FDR's Great Depression which lasted from 1929-1941, and only because of WWII did we get out of the depression. If not for WWII, the New Deal plans would have been utter failures, but FDR got a miracle (in a twisted way). And yet, historical revisionists omit all of the bad data of FDR's era and only talk about and distort the facts to make his New Deal programs look like the cure for the Great Depression, thus why so many people these days think FDR was such a great president, but then again, we learn about this crap in government run, monopolized schools that have a clear agenda in promoting big government ideologies and politicians, thus practically brainwashing students to view the government as the answer to all of society's problems. That's a major conflict of interest!|`|SlhuFfuZaa	F.D.R., much to the dismay of most people who think he was a hero for saving the country, was a socialist with communistic tendencies.  Many of 'his' ideas of the New Deal were in fact carry overs of things that Hoover had started or planned.   The C.C.Camp and W.P.A. were ideas of Hoover, not F.D.R. according to my father, who worked on W.P.A. jobs a year and a half before Roosevelt was elected. The C.C. Camp idea was originally Teddy Roosevelt's idea which was included in the National Park Proclamation.  But, Yes, the New Deal was revolutionary, in a socialist/communistic frame. It was outlined by Karl Marx in the Communist Manifesto.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	yes it created the modern welfare state, and took away many of our freedoms.

2U8F93g1aa	I've spent a lot of time wondering and reading about this myself.  From what I've been able to gather, the answer is actually quite simple.  People think alcohol is ok because its legal and they think marijuana is not ok because its illegal.  People assume that because the government decided it should be this way, that they must be right.  Most people don't ever bother to do their own research.  Another main difference is that marijuana is smoked and alcohol is something you drink.  So people think of alcohol as a beverage rather then a drug.  The people who do think of alcohol as a drug still will think marijuana is worse because it requires you to inhale smoke.  You'd think there would be a more complicated answer, but I've done a lot of reading and it really is that simple.|`|5M0FBU89aa	First off- I think it should be legalized,   BUT-   here's my take on it...    First: NO politician in his/her right mind will vote for legalization, because as soon as ONE PERSON is hurt - let's say, a mom and her baby by a stoned (or stoned and drunk) moron driver - that politician would be voted straight out of there...    Second:   Pharmaceutical industries and law enforcement working together make a killing off of the illegalizing of pot - two very VERY large politically active organizations... What are the chances of getting legalization past *those* two lobbying groups?    It would take some sort of mass riot/demonstration/change of consciousness in order to get legalization passed.    It's a classic example- the right thing to do isn't done because it's just not... well... going to be done.      Edit:  With the health care crisis looming so large, if some sort of proof can be found, mustered, and compiled  that pot offers cheap, and effective alternatives for pain-killers, muscle-relaxant, anti-depression, and anti-seizure meds, then maybe,  just MAYBE it could swing by...      Write your congressperson.  Now.|`|cMRJ8jMUaa	I still support prohibition....nothing good comes of drinking. (don't give me that crap about red wine being heart health...so is grape juice).    I agree it's a little bit ironic but I think that marijuana is a more "dangerous" drug just because of the fact that it's gotten more social acceptance.|`|04e064b1e27b063681444d2c731a008daa	It stinks really bad.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	There isn't a logical case to be made in that discussion.  Legalize it.|`|1a09434672107dc43a62784235a038fdaa	Marijuana smells bad|`|HeoS75kGaa	It's a matter of opinion whether alcohol, tobacco, or pot is good or bad.  They are all drugs.  Some are legal, others not.  Alcohol is highly regulated and taxed.  Tobacco is even more regulated and taxed.  But when it comes to a public vote whether to keep or ban them, the vote is in favor of keeping them.  When it comes to a public vote about pot, the vote is overwhelmingly against it.  Sure, you and millions might be in favor of it, but there are tens of millions against it.    Right or wrong, it doesn't matter.  The vote is what counts.    And that crap about the gateway drug, I'm sick of hearing it.  I'm against pot, but not for the gateway bullcrap.  If someone is against something, fine, but don't make up stuff to try proving your point.  Pot deadens the mind, just like BOOZE.|`|kX4JPvwwaa	Arguments against marijuana, especially when compared to alcohol, usually lead to a circular argument, "petitio principii," a logical fallacy.    I know it's bad because it's illegal, and it's illegal because it's bad.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	There is no logic, the drug that has killed more people, maimed more children, ruined more lives, caused more lost time from work, wrecked more families, caused more heartache, crippled more people, caused more carnage, than ALL other DRUGS COMBINED= ALCOHOL|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	No logical case exists.|`|Evi7mSE4aa	The government doesn't profit from pot by keeping it illegal.

If they could figure out a way to control it and tax it they would gladly legalize it.|`|5ac2dCxJaa	There isn't a "logical" case. More people die from coconut injuries than from marijuana. Some 200,000 die from smoking, 500,000 die from drinking and about 124,000 died last year from prescription drugs.    Interest in hemp first came to light in the west in the 1930s when hemp was actually described as a billion dollar crop and a bright future was predicted. However it was not to pass. What follows is a story that is fascinating, full of skull-fu* ing, conspiracy, and media manipulation any spin-doctor would be proud of. The ultimate triumph of self-interest. The biggest reason for this burial was that in the 1930s Dupont obtained patents for making nylon from coal, paper from trees and plastic from oil, and didnt want to see hemp as a potential competitor. Remarkably but not surprisingly, the companies chief financial backer at the time, Andre Mellon, owned large swathes of timber land and oil. Mellon appointed his nephew-in-law Harry Anslinger to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics while other Dupont backers such as the Hearst newspaper group began to influence public opinion towards the perceived evils of marijuana.    The whole issue is a PR propaganda ring designed to make people think that marijuana is some how a "bad" drug. Of course it is all non sense and a great example of how an entire culture can be brain washed and manipulated by manufactured science, imagery and government lies.|`|PBrDYFNwaa	There is no logic in saying marijuana is bad and alcohol OK.     The nearest logical argument is; alcohol is already socially accepted even though it causes many social, psychological and physical problems and if marijuana becomes as socially acceptable, you will have twice as many of these health and social problems than you do at present.  This being the case, marijuana is bad for society as a whole.|`|af4PkuU1aa	Along the same lines as what other people have been saying, people are literally miseducated about marijuana.  Yes, they assume it is bad just because it is illegal.  No, i don't think it should be illegal, just decriminalized.  I don't think it should be legal either because that would drive up the price and there would still be a black market.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Second hand smoke?|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	For any sound mind, there really isn't one.

Abortion is legal, but that doesn't make it 'good'.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	Because politicians are not human, they are gods, delivering eternal laws from enlightened heights.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	making marijuana legal would cause many problems in the US, imagine a drunk driver that is high as well, god help you  there is no reason to make things worst|`|YonedWiEaa	smoking is banned almost every where now...where you gonna smoke it?......in space?
3lxbqYNRaa	Should be 16.  Everyone by the age of 16 has had alcohol.|`|6nS62bB8aa	I like the age of 21.    It's a simple and relatively harmless crime to get caught drinking under age. If you get caught, but straighten out later, then that's it.    But if someone just wont give it up, the police and others can step in while your still young. You can be given another chance.    And once you get into the criminal justice system, you can't ever get out. Oh, you can get out of jail, but your name never gets out. And that's good for solving more dangerous crimes.|`|gERaZGZeaa	Of the US?  Incredibly stupid.|`|TcTK3jFNaa	Should be lower.  Its all MADDs fault.  People are going to drink anyway.

lgXSmCQRaa	Sweet question!! So. Checks and balances are there to enforce a balanced government, where each 3 branches co exist to carry the Constitution. Its prime function is to stop one branch becoming more powerful then the others, namely the executive, so no one is not more powerful then the other. This is because, each are delegated roles, and each role is 'checked' by one part of the branch. In order to pass a bill there must be communication between them.    An example of a 'check' is when the Executive (president and his cabinet) wasnt to pass a bill, so he puts it to Congress. Now, this bill must get a majority to be made into law, Congress must agree or it gets given back to the Executive. That is why it is important to have a majority of your party if you are the President, otherwise the other party can stop your bills becoming law.     Yes. I do feel it is appropriate because its the best way to get many people actively making policy rather than one man or women and his cabinet.|`|AA10324565	no.    us constitution
AA11494150	The criminal record is expunged. However, the police report would still be available at the department that investigated the incident.

I worked at a district attorney's office and when they expunge a record doesn't mean it disappears completely.

LOL)  Full of liberal mindlessness, and the inability to make it past twenty days, without having to appeal to the 'poor guy' liberals, who think it is amiable that Obama had to say "I screwed up".    Can you imagine what would have happened, under Obama after 9/11?  When he did nothing, and tried to talk to the terror nations, and the attacks against US soil, became a permanent fixture in our lives?    What are we supposed to do with a President, who is not even capable of hand picking a cabinet?  Are we supposed to lean over the presidential crib, of our inexperienced leader, and say 'you screwed up' 'yes you did' 'yes you did'.  And then we leave the nursery and ask each other, "Who is leading the US? Apparently this little boy, can't seem to handle the simple pressure of picking his cronies."    Maybe Congress should put a big sand box in the White House Lawn, and all of Obama's playmates can come over, and who ever does not throw sand in Obama's face, can be in his club, I mean Cabinet.|`|Ng3GcFX6aa	BUSH is Gone !|`|67ca5f16c70d9d86cc6e5be00db25445aa	People like you want more killing.

You simply cannot understand politics or the workings of an entire planet if all you have done in your life is equal to Quanell X and then serve less than half a year in the government before setting out on the road to the highest job.
IasHMWM2aa	Yes, they do. As a conservative I now realize we should not have wasted our money on Iraq, we could have used it right now. I would much rather spend OUR tax dollars here at home, not throw them away over there. It is better for our tax dollars to be used for US, over HERE, not thrown down rat holes over there. It is PAST TIME to work on OUR infrastructure, OUR health care, OUR energy grid and OUR manufacturing rather than wasting it on Iraq nation building.|`|AA11313983	Haven't you been watching the news?  Liberals don't have to pay taxes.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	Of course we know that we'll be paying for this stimulus bill.  We paid for the other stimulus bills, too.  But I would rather pay for a bill which is going to put a lot of people back to work than to pay even more for an illegal war.  Do you know that there are as many private mercenary soldiers in Iraq as there are regular military?  And the Blackwater soldiers make about 10 times more than the soldiers in the Army?    I'm happy to see some funding go to projects that benefit a lot of middle class people.  Up until now, I have been paying taxes which helped the upper 1% of Amercans get even richer, and I am tired of it.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	I don't know how many stimulus packages and tax rebates Reagan and Bush passed - so I don't think this is about Democrats.  And everybody will pay for the enormous budget deficit and debt, regardless from whether it comes from this stimulus package, Bush's corporate bailout, or just the ridiculous deficit ran up by Republicans the last 8 years.|`|um87XJvmaa	Yes, and so do conservatives and moderates.
pvJxkZBjaa	Not if you record it. Cos then you're not a hooker, your a porn star!|`|HeoS75kGaa	Although it involves sex, it's not a sex crime by definition.  A sex crime is one in which the sexual act itself was illegal.  What makes prostitution illegal is the [public] charging of money for sex, not the sexual act itself.    If you were to approach a hooker and ask her to have sex with you for free, you've committed no violation.    To get any conviction off your record, it involves a process called expungement, which is difficult and dependent upon many factors, including time.  You have to petition the court, an involved process, and convince them that you're worthy of it.  The arrest, though, will ALWAYS be on record, forever.

It was Hawaii with 72%.    Massachusetts had 62%, Oregon had 57%, and California had 61%.    If you roll your cursor over the state it will give you the percents.  If you click on the state, it will give you each county's percentage.  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/election...|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	Washington.|`|5rXzu0IWaa	Massachusetts. It is the most highly educated state in the Union. It just follows.    California has enough Mormons to vote for a constitutional amendment against same sex marriage. Not Mass.

I don't know if this necessarily denotes liberalism.    Among the states you posted, I would say Massachusetts.    California has a Republican governor, and they have patches of very conservative areas.  Oregon would seem to rank high, but I think they only went for Kerry in '04 by a margin of about 6 percent.|`|67ca5f16c70d9d86cc6e5be00db25445aa	Oregon.  They don't have as many conservative moguls as the other two.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I think it's a toss-up.  Because there are certain areas of all three states that are notorious for being extremely liberal.|`|THRtsl83aa	I think it depends on the specific political topic you are referring to.  I have also heard Vermont is very liberal.|`|a2fc33ef68683e992ed3b3d9ab5e762aaa	Oh wow, they're all extremely liberal.

Democrats, having no moral scruples whatsoever, and, having the mainstream media propaganda machine working on their behalf, rarely get accused of any wrongdoing, only having made a few "innocent mistakes" and "unconscious errors" in their past tax returns.  Anyone could make the silly error of failing to count donated limousine and driver service as income.  Anyone can forget to pay taxes on over $140K of income - it's just a matter of forgetfulness!!!    Nothing whatsoever to keep them from accepting a position on the President's Cabinet.  Just look at our new Treasury Secretary ...|`|L1SeinzRaa	Does anybody know Tom's Tax Attorney .... I think I might contact him.

There should be moral outrage from all including Obama.  Guess Obama needs thugs and criminials like Al Capone to pursue his policies.  Kinda makes you wonder eh!?
AA11163314	They are accountable.  However they also retain the same Constitutional protections as you do.      The fact of the matter is that if there were credible evidence that a law had been broken then this would be in the hands of a Grand Jury - not Congress.    All these hearings are is liberal McCarthyism.|`|EPObVPzVaa	No administration is going to participate in the criminalization of history because they will then be subject to it themselves.    Obama says that profits are unpatriotic and is thereby systematically imposing government on industry.  He is also about to introduce known international terrorists into the mainstream on the Continental United States.  That, my good man, is treason.  Should we take him to court today?|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Bush & Co. subverted the Constitution and Rule of Law.  Illegal torture, unlawful eavesdropping on innocent Americans, cherry-picking intelligence and lying to the public to promote war, and releasing the identity of an undercover CIA officer as revenge for her husband's anti-war position-to name a few.  As John Dean so aptly titled his book "Worse than Watergate".,|`|xJcW7cmVaa	Absolutely. They should all be above the law.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	No one outside the executive branch of government should be above the law.  But only those in a Republican administration.

Are you still mad over that Santa Clause thing?|`|vzNgMUdBaa	They should all be accountable under law.|`|fjT0GoSqaa	You had 8 years to go after Bush and did nothing.  Now that Bush is out there is no Constitutional remedy.  Impeachment would have been the only way.|`|11dGXLchaa	Whats the question?|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	their crimes are well documented in Dennis Kusinich report to congress. so they will be forever guilty in the eyes of history even if they were not tried|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Democratic Rep. Barney Franks live-in relationship with Fannie Mae executive Herb Moses while Frank was on the House Banking Committee.         Frank has a huge conflict of interest,     that should force him to resign.     due to Franks live-in boyfriend at Fannie Mae...            If you investigate Bush, You should also investigate ALL Democrap's involved with the colapse of the economic down fall of America!|`|B79lX9Inaa	They should be impeached.  What the country have went through and what it will go through before we can bring it back to a Super World Power again is because of their neglect, ineptness, selfish greed and corruptness.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	They are accountable under the law. But there were no "illegal activities" and the executive privilege confidentiality between a President and his advisors remains intact, even after that President is out of office.    There are always aspects of personal communications between a president and his advisors that the public and Congress do not have a right to know.    You can whine and pule all you want and get your panties in a twist, but it still doesn't make their actions criminal, and it still doesn't mean that whiny leftists have any right to infringe on protected confidential interactions.

However now it seems we can all live together and be peacefull.  Get rid of the black month, mexican month, and even a future white month.  Lets do a whole month just dedicated to people in general all colors all walks.  We can all get a month off and really come together and have some fun.

America has only borrowed about $800 B since it began.  The bail out is now at $890 B and being on for that much.   We have to pay that back, not the government, they get the money from us.  The government has no money!  "We" have the money the government is going to use to pay that.   With all that is wrong right now.  How much more can "you" pay before you go broke?  When your job is gone.  How will you pay what you owe on that $890 B?  How stupid do have to be to think getting mired in that much more debt is going to fix anything?  FDR tried it and prolonged the great depression for years, and he borrowed far less than $890B.  Now if BO gave everyone that filed taxes last year $100,000.  It would be far less than the $890 B bail out.  We could pay down our mortgage, pay off our credit cards, and buy a new car with money left to put in the bank.  This would fix the mortgage crisis, fix the credit card mess, fix the car makers, fix the banks, and put the population back on solid ground financially.  After all we are going to be doing the paying for that money. Shouldn't we be getting the money?  Do you like getting the payments but none of the borrowed money?  Would you make payments on a car you never got?    Well this bail out is the very same thing!  All the experts are saying that $890 B is not enough.  It will take at least $1.5 T in bail out money, and that should be considered a conservative estimate.     As nightfall does not come at once, neither does oppression. In both instances there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air - however slight - lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.  - William O. Douglas, judge (1898-1980)     All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate that would be oppression.   Thomas Jefferson     A political leader is necessarily an imposter since he believes in solving life's problems without asking its question.    Andr Malraux     Conservative, n:  A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal who wishes to replace them with others.  Ambrose Bierce     What is conservatism?  Is it not the adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried?    Abraham Lincoln    A liberal is a man or a woman or a child who looks forward to a better day, a more tranquil night, and a bright, infinite future.    Leonard Bernstein     "The Liberals are the flying saucers of politics. No one can make head nor tail of them and they never are seen twice in the same place."  - John G. Diefenbaker    Politics, it seems to me, for years, or all too long, has been concerned with right or left instead of right or wrong.    Richard Armour    Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it whether it exists or not, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedy.    Ernest Benn    All of us who are concerned for peace and triumph of reason and justice must be keenly aware how small an influence reason and honest good will exert upon events in the political field.    Albert Einstein     Take our politicians:  they're a bunch of yo-yos.  The presidency is now a cross between a popularity contest and a high school debate, with an encyclopedia of cliches the first prize.    Saul Bellow     Those who are too smart to engage in politics are punished by being governed by those who are dumber.    Plato    Mankind will never see an end of trouble until... lovers of wisdom come to hold political power, or the holders of power... become lovers of wisdom.    Plato    The problem with political jokes is they get elected.  ~Henry Cate, VII     Midas, they say, possessed the art of old  Of turning whatsoe'er he touch'd to gold;  This modern statesmen can reverse with ease -  Touch them with gold, they'll turn to what you please.  ~John Wolcot     We have plenty of Confidence in this country, but we are a little short of good men to place our Confidence in.    Will Rogers     There ought to be one day - just one - when there is open season on senators.

gHLryouJaa	I voted McCain, because despite my disagreeing with him on illegals amnesty and free trade, he still wouldn't spend us into oblivion with another 816 billion federal bailout, or turn our economy over to federal control and effectively smash the spine of capitalism in America.    Every decision Obama has made since the election has convinced me I made the right choice.

Then again, a dead rabbit would a better president than *sigh* the other choice.|`|D2YaTaUIaa	That's two of the main reasons why many Obama supporters voted for Obama. Just because he is African American.  Plus the same reason why Bush got elected twice before him. He played the "tough" man approach, against his opponent.

AA10627756	I think he was a Democrat, because he was raised in the South at a time when most Southerners were Democrats.    I think he had the thought process of a democrat, that is, that the government should intercede on people's behalf when they cannot for themselves.    His military service was not of a calibre, as such, that would make me think he would be a republican.    Just my humble opinion.    And according to www.elvisinfonet.com:    Politics    Elvis was primarily a strong conservative, tempered with a compassionate liberalism. He was patriotic to a fault and believed in giving back to his country a share of what had been given to him (so he was never involved in tax reduction, avoidance or minimisation schemes). He also thought it was important to support the President regardless of his political party. Elvis didn't think it was right to take a political stand in public on issues and use his influence to mould public opinion|`|2oO36b0maa	Maybe he was an Independent?  I think  maybe he could have been.  Like that  one said, he went to see Nixon.  Edit- LOL  What's wrong with being   Independent?  I think he would have  chosen whoever he thought was  best at the time.|`|q3E1ouQvaa	I think he was a rock and roll star.|`|AA11598520	I never really cared about his politics.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	He was a good friend of President Nixon.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	I think he was a Republican because he visited Nixon at the WH.  Nixon gave him some kind of reward.  Also, Presley joined the Army and served over seas.  He was also into gospel and country music.  I think he was definitely a Republican.

Why do we have over 12 million illegal aliens in addition to the many LEGAL immigrants(the ones who do it the right way). If they hated us SO much I really don't think they would be coming here in droves.  Maybe the ones who do hate us do so because we give the people who long for freedom an alternative to their opressive governments. They may also hate us because we HAVE freedom and we keep giving it back to the government or letting them, make that demanding that they take it from us. Just look at the stimulus package they are trying to force down our throats. They are confiscating little bits here and there, with OUR PERMISSION. Unless we stop it now it will continue.

GrKiEDb1aa	Is your first name GULLIBLE?  I spent 20 years and I'm not gay.  Never had a gay experience in the Navy.  Gays don't hit on straight guys, for the most part.

There was this kid like that in my shop and it was kind of fun to see him freak out at the mere mention of hot man-on man action.     Know what the first thing most people think when they meet somebody who's rabidly homophobic? That guy must be gay and in really deep denial. In case you missed that, what I'm trying to say is, acting anti-gay is a really good way to make people think that you are gay.    Don't be that guy.

And here they're the ones accusing liberals of putting too much weight and value on the opinion of the EU. What a joke.

That would create more jobs to a wider reach of Americans and pride back in the workplace.  We would thrive.  Chamber of Congress is still thinking of the old way that we can clearly see does not work.  That is why there is trade wars, it's all about the money = power.

But he is still telling the public that he can.   People please read the agreement. It is worded a lot differently than the White House published report on this.

We also believe that when someone commits a crime that is so heinous and atrocious to deserve the death penalty, then that person has forfeited their right to life because of their actions.|`|AA10382849	No|`|P8vt2aLhaa	No suicide is taking your own life,not only is suicide against the law of man but also God's law ,where as capital punishment is a crime control measure that is earned by the offender who is found guilty of a capital crime.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	How do you outlaw suicide? What do they do once you kill yourself? Put your corpse in prison?
SsvoX5doaa	Read the following information from Germany (link below) - just contact them directly instead of hiring a lawyer - that could save you a lot of time, money and frustration.  And if you are serious about obtaining / claiming citizenship, I highly recommend learning the language, culture, etc.      http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/e...    Advantages of dual citizenship:    As a German citizen you are entitled to a European passport.    A German citizen is entitled to freedom of passage, work and residence, with no time limit, in each of the European Union member states.    A German citizen and his children are entitled to free academic studies in Germany and other European countries (in accordance with the conditions of each country).    A German citizen is also entitled to benefits from other countries; for example, he can travel to the USA without a Visa of any kind (for up to 3 months) or obtain a work visa in Australia.    As a German citizen, you may vote in Germany.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	Germany does not allow dual citizenship for naturalised citizens.     the ONLY people who can legally claim dual citizenship, are those who are born with one german parent and one NON-german parent.     Anyone who naturalizes to german citizenship MUST renounce ALL  other citizenships they hold.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	German citizenship is based primarily on the principle of Jus sanguinis.  This means "by blood."  Just being born there isn't enough.    Was one, or both, of your parents a citizen of Germany at the time of your birth?  If not, you cannot make a claim on German citizenship.|`|fb7u8ctSaa	Also, in conjunction with the above answer, if you've never served the required public time which is required by the German government of every Male citizen i.e. MIlitary Service, A Year of Charity Work, etc. then they may call upon you to complete it now.   I know some people that this has happened to, and it is also the reason for which Arnold Schwarzenegger lost his Austrian Citizenship.    Taxes might also be an issue since I believe all German Citizens MUST pay something into the taxes of the country.
fKFvzlzQaa	I recommend that you read the book: "Icon of   Evil, Hitler's Mufti and the Rise of Radical Islam" by Professors John Rothmann and David Dalin.    This scholarly work not only gives a very well documented presentation of the Holocaust with respect to the Jewish people, the book also presents a well documented and scholoarly appraoch to the deaths of other victims of the Holocasut such as Gay People, Gypsies and many other victims who were also murdered by the regime of Adolf Hitler and the NAZIS.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	There is plenty of research in that area. If you want to do more, or work to make it more visible, not one would begrudge you that.|`|SAaEiqHvaa	i agree, i met a man once that told me about his experience as a jew that survived the holocust, and he believed that the hebrew community took controll of the whole post war aftermath so as to further their "were the most hated race" theory... he told me that the history books were not a fair insight to the period.. history is written by the winners..|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	the Jews were the hardess to hide and the largest in numbers...Political Nay Sayers just disappeared...the gays arnt really noticable to the naked eye, they would kind of need to be caught in the act...and Gypsies we're pretty good at leaving the bad situations...so yes the Jews werent the only ones but there majority in the situation got them more publicity|`|azUGjQXuaa	allot has been left out. look into the night of long knives and see who was gay and eliminated by hitler before he came into power.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	You are absolutely correct.     The number of total deaths was FAR above 6 million, when you include those that you mentioned, as well as Jehovah Witnesses, the disabled.     Find a good history book on WW II, that will give you more rounded numbers on all deaths in all countries.    They are not blatantly left out of ALL books, but the phrase 'not all victims were Jews, but all Jews were victims' tends to put the light more on those deaths than any others|`|HeoS75kGaa	Well, a lot of the public knowledge about the Holocaust is about the Jews, but not the 'available' research.  If you're limiting yourself to what's commonly hanging around, then it's not the fault of others that you're not researching it more thoroughly.      Very true that the Jews were not Hitler's only victims, nor even that they were the vast majority of victims.  But the Jews were the basis of his genocide, and he relied a lot on that Book of Zion for his rationale, expanding it to include other suspicious ethnic groups.    From there, he expanded outward.  Even though the English shared a lot of common heritage with the Germans, Hitler considered them diluted, mongrelized, and therefore should be subjugated.  Even many Germans were bastardized according to his logic.  Had Hitler been able to live forever and not be defeated, he may well have ended up exterminating most of the world, including 2/3 of Germany.    He WAS whacked out, you know.  But, hey, being illegitimate, maybe he should have started with himself.|`|57L8ZODkaa	I don't know what you are talking about. There are plenty of references to the "others, you just have to look for it. The attention of jewish is more of a genralization peope use.|`|uXtonVN4aa	the jews were mostly spoken of b/c of how history portraits them.the jews were always persecuted since ancient times b/c people believe in numerous amounts of gods instead of the jewish had(and later muslim and christian belief). children were often raised with stories that the jewish were horrible women rappers, and stealers and all that stupid BS. the jewish was most of the population of the 6 million    Nay-sayers hardly spoke out and when they did, they were killed in a remote location    Gays wouldnt speak out, of course, and if they did, they'd be killed    Gypsies i think were left out mostly b/c they had no real placement in the world. but Hilter killed them too for witchcraft.    i agree that its somewhat biased, but our society continues to be so...idk how to really make it better      look it up =)
cMRJ8jMUaa	What the first person said, 97% accurate at telling someone is nervous/stressed, not whether they're lying or not.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	They are unreliable that's why they are not admissible in court.|`|56650a55637223b1b968b4235bb50735aa	The test was reliable and accurate. It correctly measured your physiological responses to the questions. If the situation was as you said, indeed your responses would be considered as attempts at falsifying the information. It is no wonder the examiner reacted to you in this manner. You could always ask for a retest.|`|AA10301974	They are 97% accurate. However 1 in 33 people have false results, that isn't anywhere near foolproof. And people can be trained to show all truth or false results on any question. It isn't close enough for a warrant to check you further.     It is however enough for them to continue investigating you. Take one again, I bet it will have a different result, and so may the following one.     Unfortunately the police with go on a wild goose chase now.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	They aren't reliable & the results can not be used against you in a court of law.|`|RAZOhrnGaa	The examiner obviously doesn't understand how to use a lie detector... I have administered many of said polygraph tests myself, and we are trained to always ask a few base questions (such as "Is your name..."), questions you will obviously answer truthfully, just to see how you react to being asked questions under the stress of a lie detector test.  Regardless, our polygraphs are not 100% effective, but fairly close (97% may be a stretch, but sound about right), and it doesn't matter because they cannot be used in court as evidence against you.  They are possible to trick, and obviously extremely anxious people can cause misreadings (though I am confident it was the examiner's incompetence that caused the confusion; he should have been able to account for your nervousness, unless you were peeling the sensors off or something).|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	well look on the bright side. if you have failed, they can still pull the fingerprints from the written checks and prolly video survel. if you didnt do it then dont worry about it
tZUSVuUvaa	Abortion should absolutely remain legal.     Your story is very sad and I feel for you, but they can't change the laws to give the fathers the right to stop an abortion without also taking away the woman's control of her own body, and that's absolutely wrong and horrifying. How you would feel if you were forced to go through a grueling and painful 9 month ordeal that you didn't want? What if a rapist or abusive man was able to force his victim to continue a pregnancy just to further distress her? Rapes cases often come down to he said/she said and there are just too many women who would suffer because of this.    There are far more men out there who want nothing to do with the child then there are men who want to take custody of the child and raise it themselves. There are also a lot of men who convince their pregnant girlfriends to continue the pregnancy and promise to be there, then bail just before the birth or when the child is still young. There are child support laws now, but many men are still able to get away with not paying their share.     It's a crappy situation but I think abortion is still necessary. Even if surgical abortions were outlawed, women would still be getting back alley abortions or taking herbal concoctions to cause a miscarriage. It's been going on since the beginning of time.     Abortion may end a potential life, but I think the lives that are already independent and having an impact on society take precedence.      I really feel for you and I feel for your wife too. If she was told she would never have be able to have kids, she was probably used to that idea and had planned her life around it. Suddenly having that turned upside down would be a huge shock. It sounds like she acted rashly on that shock. I think that abortion clinics should have longer waiting times when the woman is still really early on in the pregnancy to give them more time to consider and make sure that they really want an abortion. Not every woman who has an abortion regrets it, but the ones who don't think about it enough or act too quickly sometimes do.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	I believe that happened. I don;'t believe it is typical, because you (both of you) did not plan. The whole story is evidence of trouble in your relationship, even if you hadn't realized it before.     Apparently a big part of her self perceptions, her persona if  you will, was wrapped up in her, and maybe both of you as a couple, not having children. You apparently were not so invested in the idea of being childless.    Your child was not killed. A medical procedure was done at your wife;s election, and the clinic has no obligation to report her appearance there to you, in fact they are probably prohibited from doing that.    None of you are acting rationally right now under stress, but help is available. Have her ask the clinic for counseling, individually or together, for you, or work to find your own counseling if you want.    Your marriage hangs in the balance.|`|cMRJ8jMUaa	I don't care to read your backstory.  I equate killing a fetus to killing a full grown adult, the later is clear cut not allowed so neither should the former be.|`|04e064b1e27b063681444d2c731a008daa	Your wife is selfish, be happy shes gone.|`|HBa3IbXEaa	No, sex outside of marriage should be illegal - then there's no need for abortion laws at all.|`|HeoS75kGaa	Life is tough.

Look, I understand you're going through a tough time, but so do most people.  And making something illegal usually isn't what it takes to save them that grief.  You and your wife were already having a tough time, and it doesn't matter which decision she made.  You'd still be going through a tough Life.|`|4cQSsDaZaa	would you kill a baby? if your answer is no then i think that pretty much answers your question

"Ethnic groups:  Black African 79%, White 9.6%, Colored 8.9%, Indian/Asian 2.5% (2001 census)" ~ https://www.cia.gov/library/publications... ~    And also, there is a large amount of racism against peoples of European heritage these days by Black Africans. You'd think that years of being oppressed themselves, the majority of them would learn not to make that same mistake. Yet, many are. It's a very sad fact of history.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	South Africa is predominantly WHITE. Making them the majority.|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	Yes, whites are currently disadvantaged. It is hard for them to get jobs, to get university acceptance.    It is not reported as racism on whites is not a popular media topic.|`|hhybi69Naa	yes the majority of South Africans are black but black people are NOT racist! It's mostly white people not all though, for example my friends will speak badly about black people, I've learnt most blacks just want peace and have freedom. There are those who still hurt over the apartheid but the most amazing thing is they are forgiving people.  the reason many white South Africans have moved is not because of racism its because of the crime and they do not have faith in their own country. Soon they will learn that crime is not only in South Africa but everywhere, and soon they will learn they cannot run away from who they are, South Africans. the people that have evacuated expect change to happen so fast, Rome was not built in a day. They start comparing us to 1st world countries who's history is not as terrible as South Africa's. I just hope that RSA will find its feet and become a greater country.    OMW i find it so funny that some of the people that have answered here don't even live in South Africa!

AA11452842	Adultery is punishable under the UCMJ.

The military does not punish soldiers for adultry anymore.    If it is brought to the commanders attention, he will just order the soldier to end the relationship.    Thats it, thats all that happens.    Now if after being ordered to end the relationship, the soldier does not.    Then they will go after them for disobeying a direct order.    The military changed its policy on adultry around 2002.    Now it is not a big issue.|`|014NXPfFaa	We they will both get in pretty serious trouble.  Demotions, removal from unit, negative reports, etc.  They could lose pay.  He could be discharged (but in all reality, that's not likely unless it happens again after he's been counseled).  If it's true, and they are caught.    If you wish to pursue it, make sure you save whatever documentation you have.|`|vvmphVCOaa	The military DOES punish soldiers for adultery. I had a family member who was in the military. He dated a girl who turned out to be married to a solider. Her husband found out, he got in BIG trouble and was dishonorably discharged from the military.     Before you make any rash decision talk to him about what you found. It may be something or nothing but trust your gut! It can be very lonely for the both of you. I know, my husband was deployed two years ago to Iraq and he's going back this March.  Your story sounds a little like one of my own. If you would like any details on it you can e-mail me at wallabearpercival@yahoo.com    Is this your first deployment? Do you have any military friends/spouses to talk to?|`|StxCHnTkaa	Send whatever evidence you have to the 1SG or CO and ask them to investigate. Let them handle it from there. Personally, I'd get the divorce papers prepared in the meantime. Lots of marriages end during deployment, it's a sad part of military life. Your husband is scum and so is the SGT he cheated with. Your life with him would never be the same after cheating. You deserve to be with someone who loves you and only you...|`|GrKiEDb1aa	He AND she can be charged under Article 134 of the UCMJ.

b8uYVhVMaa	Where do you want the "apologies" to stop?    Africans were enslaving their own kind a long time before any european nations colonised them.  It was Africans selling africans which kept half of the trade going.    Arabs were enslaving africans before Europeans - why not get them to apologise.  Why not get the descendants of Ghengis Khan to apologise, or the Chinese or many other nations.    Why not head of to Africa now and see what is happening where tribal warfare is rife and africans are effectively enslaving their own when they are not doing that then they are killing each other by the hundreds of thousands.    Get a bit of perspective on things please.|`|ngUb0nIzaa	Quit playing with yourself or you might go blind.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	Africans where selling Africans to everybody, Spanish, european and arab not just whites.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Whatcha smoking?|`|3lxbqYNRaa	Looks like you are making enemies with this one dude!

So who would you like to apologise and to whom?      Would it be OK if everyone who benefited in any way or anyone whose descendants ended up better off than they might otherwise have been, regardless of origin or skin colour, was put back in the position they would have been in without any slavery?  That would certainly deplete the USA and expand the population of Africa ... or is that not what you are suggesting?    Or shall we get on with our lives ..... It's a conundrum, isn't it?|`|QqxrVVnlaa	One or two Western leaders have indicated that they think it was a bad thing but not many of them have apologised.    Imperialism has left large parts of the African continent absolutely impoverished. Slavery was responsible for wrecking tribal and family relationships to such a degree that it will never recover.    Western slavers would have taken slaves without the help of African leaders, but their support meant there was much less bloodshed. You could ask why India was allowed to be raped in order to pay for the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Local leaders enriched themselves by selling slaves in the same way that Indian leaders enriched themselves by allowing Britain to virtually steal their natural resources and undermine opposition from their own population.    British dock workers opposed slavery and refused to work on slave ships in protest. It was our leaders who carried out the slave trade.    It's also an important part of US history...certainly an embarrassing part but it should be remembered.|`|C5JxA8k0aa	What the f++k apologise? Do you read history?There has been slavery in Britain for centuries, which involved whites who were the slaves of other whites. Most of the slavery throughout the history of Africa, has involved blacks who were the slaves of other blacks or Arabs.   In fact Arabs have been involved in more slavery than any other ethnic group. They even used to raid  southern Europe to get white slaves throughout the middle ages-Ive heard estimates as high as 6 million over a period of about 300 years.By your rationale you should take responsibility for everything negative ever done by a black guy such as IDI amen Robbert Mugabe, gadafee etc.The reason why we don't want to open the floodgates to millions of Africans is the same reason why you don't want millions of whites or Arabs or whatever colonising your country.  I lost half of my family in ww2 overseas  fighting the Germans and in air raids.Does that mean that the Germans are responsible for all of my personal problems, and the problems in my country? The west donates about 400 billion dollars a year in aid to Africa, however still african countries blame the west for their problems.Maybe African countries and Africans the world over should take responsibility for their own actions and the state of their own countries rather than dwelling in a state of victim hood.|`|8c26794a87dbf74cd24ea326b3136147aa	Do you also want us to apologise for changing the countries that are now democratic from basic farming, swamp and jungle to high standard living conditions.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	You're asking a pretty complicated question actually. There are a lot of things that would shape the answer. First off, would your parents be opposed to the idea of your staying in Australia? If so, it might be difficult on that basis alone, but you would at the least want to consult with a lawyer; at 17 you are certainly old enough to make some life decisions and this could be one.  Again, you'd need legal advice.    Let's say your parents may not be happy but aren't going to fight you on this. Where would you stay? How would you live? How long do you want to stay, a few months, a few years, a lifetime?    Legal permission to live in Australia is complex, but start with the website below and check carefully all the info in each category.     Right away I can suggest a couple of possibilities.    If your parent(s) have permanent residence in Australia you probably do too. And they can leave but you probably would still be able to stay. Again you'd need a lawyer to be sure.     Probably they don't, so the question is, what kind of visa do you have now? Look in your passport to find out if you don't know. If you're a US Military dependent you may not have any but most likely you have a limited visa and it expires when your parents leave. Still check and see.    One obvious choice would be to apply for a student visa. If you are going to continue high school or do University work anyway, do it in Australia. You'll have to be sure you can qualify and show you can support yourself. This would give you a number of years to live there, and if you get educated in a skill in short supply in Australia you might well qualify for immigration and permanent residence.    If you have friends whose parents would be willing to take care of you until you finish HS or are 18 and your parents wouldn't object I'd think that would be quite simple to arrange, though the devil is in the details.    With a US passport you get an "assessment level" of 1 for a student visa, which means it will surely be approved as long as you don't show any inclination to be an illegal immigrant. You pay a few hundred dollars in fees and you can work up to 20 hours a week as long as you are in school and full time in scheduled breaks.    If you want to go to university, and are accepted, it's pretty much the same deal. Of course you have to find a way to pay for school, and support yourself but part time work is allowed.    Now at the end of your time in school you have to go back to America, but if you get a degree in the right thing you might be able to come back or even to stay as a temporary or permanent worker. A lot of occupations seem to qualify for a high level of points (butcher,60 and massage therapist, 40 for example) so check out the complete list and rules. If you have been working and living in Oz you will also be able to see if you can find an employer to sponsor you which is an easier path.     So it seems in sum that you need to do a lot of investigating and planning but you almost certainly can stay at least for a while and possibly forever. CHECK the WEBSITE and read and understand it all.|`|erIgy7rEaa	You can be like that kid from Drillbit tailer his parents i think are in australia that would be hilarious|`|nGkCWpRVaa	get a work permit and a job and your away

5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	Palestine won't stop the rocket attacks on Israel after the withdrawal in both 2003 and recently. I'm sorry but I think it's Palestine that has the problem.    Also, Palestine is a region, not a people. Before 1948, everybody who lived there was a "Palestinian" whether they were Jewish, Muslim, or Christian. Palestine also was never a country before 2003. It was always a province of another empire. The name "Palestine" was given to the region to demoralize the Jews after a revolt against Roman occupation.    Also, Before 1967, the Gaza Strip belonged to Egypt and the West Bank was part of Jordan. There really isn't any "Palestinian" nation, just Arabs who live there and try to make a big deal out of a small problem that's already been solved. Muslims also make up over 20% of Israel's population so you can't say that they kicked all of the Palestinians out. And anyways, there is only 1 Jewish nation in the world and it covers a very small area compared to the rest of the Muslim dominated Middle East.|`|meFAMvhMaa	It amazes me that people think it's okay for certain countries and groups to openly talk about "wiping Israel off the face of the map". Even worse, these same countries and groups are actively pursuing ways to actually try and do so. If that's not a form of terrorism, then I don't know what is. These people will never succeed though. Israel will never be destroyed. All that attempt to do so will share that fate, not Israel.|`|odBWpML6aa	You are a descendant of the Romans?  "Palestine" is the name the Romans gave to Israel, Judea and Samaria.  Amazing!      Up until recently Jews, Christians, Muslims, Marionites, and other sects living in that area conquered two thousand years ago were all called Palestinians.  And even the Romans recognized that the place was a Jewish Kingdom.  Do you?    Middle-East-Info.Org claims the follwoing:    "The freest Arabs, Christians, Jews and Muslims in Mideast are Israelis  77% of Israeli Arabs would rather live in Israel  Arabs in Israel have equal rights under the law  Arabs in Israel can vote for whoever they want  Arabs in Israel can worship freely  Arabs in Israel are entitled to the full same state education as all other Israelis  Arabs are members of the Israeli parliament and ministers in the government"    Do you disagree with those facts as stated?    But what about a Jew in Gaza?  What happens to a Jew lost in Gaza?  You tell me!      Be honest!  You know who the terrorists are!    * * *  shatnerpossum says that Arabs lost their vote in Israel.  Not quite -- two of Arab parties were banned -- for good reason, perhaps, support of treason is a good reason, eh?   (The ultra-zionist Kach party is STILL banned -- does that mean some Jews are second class citizens?)  Still, Arab voting wasn't banned, just two parties.  And that did not last long  and did not effect any elections.  On January 22 the Israeli Supreme Court restored the two parties.  (see link) Catch up with the news, shatnerpossum!    In Gaza, like Saudi Arabia, Jews are totally banned.  Not second class, not third class, a Jew in Gaza is in immediate and direct risk of death, and no one in Gaza would find it murder.|`|AA10691319	the palistinians are trying to clense the globe of the jews and the jewish state, the isralies are trying to protect their homelands, which sounds more like a terrorist.|`|1amF7oNwaa	HAMAS ARE THE REAL TERRORISTS BUT BY BACKING HAMAS THE PALESTINAINS ARE TO BLAME FOR WHAT HAS HAPPEN TO THEM.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Both are terrorizing one another.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	Hammas the few of them that launch rockets into Israel, forcing Israel to defend itself.     Most of the people in both sides just want simple peace, but their are a few that mess things up for everyone else.      The problem is when ever you have a oppressed people their is only one way to truly get a majority of the world to want to help them. This is through non violence protesting.

Israel shut down the Arab political parties last month. Arabs are second class citizens.    Also, Hamas didn't start it. Further, Israeli's current policies will continue the violence; they blame Hamas for all attacks (regardless of who does the attack).|`|a2fc33ef68683e992ed3b3d9ab5e762aaa	I don't think Palestinians are terrorists.  Neither do I think Israeli's are terrorists.  The problem is that the Palestinian people voted HAMAS (a terrorist group) in as their leadership.  I think the Palestinians would alleviate a lot of their own suffering if they were to elect some reasonable leaders rather than terrorists.  Those HAMAS terrorists don't care about the Palestinian people.  They just use and abuse them to promote their own agenda of hatred and wanting to drive Israel into the sea.
AA12109395	You would not be charged, however you probably would be stopped if possible. Until the police ascertain that you have a bonafide emergency, they merely see you as a wreckless driver who is putting himself and others in danger. Better to either allow the plolice to provide you with an escort or remain stationary and let them call you an ambulance.|`|7qxqkjNhaa	As I first read the question I thought sure I ummmm no I would stop you and render assistance.     If life and limb is at risk why risk the life on the way to the hospital by driving at speed to endanger others too, not a good call.     You say you live far away....How about life flight, they have medical on board.     If the victim is still alive and needs to get there "now" or they die. Then they need full medical attention from EMS or by bystanders with assistance from 911 operators which is better then anything a fast driver can do while on the road driving.     If the victim is alive and is going to survive they need to be stabilized first then transported.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You should be charged because you would be putting other lives at risk. If someone is shot, you need to call an ambulance.|`|1r4HQequaa	ummm ?  i doubt they will  but maybe they'll stop you  or call a rescue|`|ONPK7jznaa	It is recommended to call 911 first.

ASixHKWKaa	Road runner, was correct, doing a split op for the Army Reserve means you go to boot camp (basic) the summer between your JR and SR year, if you graduate you attend advanced training (MOS school) the summer you graduate. In the mean time your recruiter should have taken you to your Reserve unit (they are required to) and you should be attending drill. If they have not taken you to your unit try to find out where your unit is and when they drill and start going. Once you are there speak with someone about the recruiter. (Don't espect any thing to come of it though)      Good luck and thanks for serving!|`|mKArP6jKaa	ok this the deal one summer you do bootcamp the next summer you go to ur job training school instead of doing it all at once. And since ur a junior all through ur senior yr u will be gettn paid for going to drill that one weekend a month. This is why its a good option... okay im doing navy reserve (wish they had split option) Well im going to college and bootcamp is 9 weeks and my training school 9 weeks thats 18 weeks. Therefore i cant start school with everyone else in september i now have to wait till the winter quarter to start. So if ur going to college its more convinent but if not it really is just ur preferecne like mayb you want 2 stay a kid another yr.|`|3xTNOevjaa	I had the same situation. My recruiter told me that you are doing them seperately each summer until you graduate from  high school. You sill get paid like 220+ish.

6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	It's no problem.  You can do it either way.  You can go in person to any BI Office and pay for an extension, and pay the fine for not getting it before the visa expired, or you can hire a fixer to do everything for you.    Generally, you can get a series of renewals that enable you to stay up to two years without leaving.  However, each extension will become progressively more expensive.  The full two years, if there are no late fees, will most likely run you about $500.    The best fixers usually can be found at travel agencies.  NEVER hire a fixer who's just hanging out on the street by the BI Office.    Here's the fee schedule...    http://immigration.gov.ph/index.php?opti...

Education: I think people should have more of a choice in selecting their schools, and they should be allowed to compete instead of having them socialized.     Environment: I am for strict environmental standards, because I believe when you go to a foreign country, it is the first thing along with infrastructure you judge them on    Military: I would go with less high tech weapons, and more soldiers in the Army and Marines and better pay.     Wars: I would begin scaling down Iraq immediately to below our Afghanistan levels gradually, and I would put a few thousand more in Afghanistan.     Foreign Affairs: I would stress diplomacy, and reach out to other countries, including our enemies before fighting. I would involve our allies more.    Energy: I would do all of the above. Drill for more oil at home until we develop new technology, and at the same time, develop alternative energy.    Immigration: I would prefer better enforcement of our existing laws and hire more border patrol, with no amnesty    Civil Rights: Abolish Affirmative Action    Gun Laws: I think everyone has the right to own guns, just not assault weapons or machine guns. There should be background checks, and possibly some class or training if you never served in the military or police.

I voted for Barack Obama in November, because from an independent's standpoint, he was just the more solid, well rounded candidate.    my Party - the Free American's Party    Education - use of vouchers to spur private sector growth, with an eventual goal of strengthening private schools and lowering their cost so that everyone can afford them    Environment - strict enforcement of results-orientated enviornmental issues (such as regulations regarding fishery depletion).    The Military - used only for the purpose for which it was designed; immediate self-defense. I would recall American soldiers from the 100 countries where we have soldiers stationed, and end the nearly 100 billion dollars in foreign military aid that we spend annually, and reinvest it for the sake of the soldiers: higher pay, better equipment, better healthcare for veterans, and more scholarship opportunities for soldiers leaving the service. Introduce an amendment to the constitution requiring all use of military action to be put to popular vote, then require that all citizens who voted 'yes' for war enlist into public service that directly supports the military (with the option to simply enlist into the military instead). Reduce the president's ability to deploy military personnel without the express approval of congress (congress has never declared war since World War II, but we've had how many "police actions" since then?)    The Wars in Iraq and Afganistan - End them as quickly as rationaly and militarily possible.     Foreign Affairs - "Friendly trade relations with all, entangling alliances with none"    Energy - repeal regulation that makes it cost prohibitive to build new oil refineries, as well as regulations that make nuclear energy too impractical to build. Offer tax breaks to companies that invest in alternative energy. Reinvigorate the American energy industry in order to successfully compete against the OPEC cartel. Foster friendly trade relations with Russia and Canada, both of whom are energy up-and-comers.    Immigration - reform the immigration system to streamline the process of naturalization in order to turn those who are seeking their own American dream into happy, tax-paying citizens    Healthcare - End the massive lobbying efforts of the Insurance agencies, break up the racket that is big pharm's fascist grip over the industry, gradually seek a pathway towards a healthy, market orientated private sector healthcare, as the successful auto insurance and house insurance companies have    Business - Repeal the Sarbanes-Oxley, introduce a line-item veto to reduce favoritism among politicians and businesses by blocking pork. Get business completely out of government, and get government completely out of business, ensuring a relationship that mirrors the separation of church and state    Tax Policy - Tariffs, an excise tax, and a corporate income tax would be the only taxes needed to run the government at spending levels from 2000. Also introduce courts fees for any punitive damages awarded in order to reduce lawyer "ambulance chasing" as well as provide funding for local police and courtrooms. Abolish the income tax, reduce government spending to pay off national debt, and reinstitute the semi-gold standard on which the Dollar was based upon until 1971. Allow for competing currencies in order to use competition to stimulate stronger currency rates, as well as provide stability in the money market by allowing citizens to switch currencies when one is weakening.    Civil Rights - Reaffirm a 100% commitment to civil rights. End segregation against homosexuals. Commit to an exhaustive review of the affirmative action program and determine the most rational course of action to boost African American income levels to mirror that of the other racial identities, then gradually phase out affirmative action when this action has been taken    Church and State - reaffirm the Governments commitment to secularism, revoke the tax-exemption status of any church that donates money to political causes.    Gun Laws - defer to the local and state authorities on the distribution and purchasing of firearms.    Crime - Legalize and regulate all illicit drugs in order to strike to the source of gang violence by letting free market initiatives and rule of law drive the drug cartels out of business, as was done with alcohol after prohibition.    Abortion/Birth Control - 100% legal in all cases, zero federal funding for such programs.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	I already have a party.  Its called the Libertarian party.

4hGua8Tjaa	look at Salt Lake City a few months back - The kid enters the mall with the intent on killing as many people as possible.  He shot and killed 5 people and was searching for the next victim.  An off duty police officer was carrying his fire arm and cut the shooter down before he could continue.  He saved many lives.  Criminals are embolden because if they have the weapon they have the power.  If they think there is a probability of someone else who carries they may think twice.  I don't believe the psychopaths care either way.  Even if it were legal I doubt most people would carry, but those that do would have to go through training to carry a concealed weapons permit.  Those who go through the trouble to get one of those permits typically respect the weapon and aren't likely to be stupid with it.|`|62bc9663d22b90f9bf55d4336bc5f4e3aa	Yes because someone would have plugged that asshole long before he killed 32 people.|`|AA10348999	I think it is a piss poor idea, because quite simply they would create more problems then they would solve. It would increase substantially gun crime on campus and only looks attractive in situations like this one. Aside from that it is the campus' decision, because that is an area where any institution has the right to decide upon. Almost forgot the original question, but honestly from what i heard it was extremely quick so it is hard to say if it would've been much help if anyone was armed.|`|AA12038634	He not would have killed as many.  Criminals and liberals fear armed citizens.|`|fFujmIWuaa	yes|`|884a5bc32fca6d468f9e8afb165f0050aa	I totally agree that people need to arm themselves for protection.  I am a big believer in the 2nd Amendment.  Less people would have died in Virginia if somebody had a weapon.  Its even possible the shooter wouldn't have committed this crime in the first place if he knew there was a chance several people were armed.  He obviously was mentally ill so I do believe if he couldn't have gotten his hands on a gun he would have found another way.  Taking guns away from U.S. citizens is not the answer.  People need to quit blaming the guns and blame the shooter or maybe even take a hard look at how society creates and then ignores the mentally ill.

70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	The parallels are chilling, and more than one economist has noted that America is following in the footsteps of the Japanese economy, right down to the massive upswing in government spending and stimulus packages aimed to invigorate the economy.     Japan has been stagflating (a stagnating economy, despite massive government spending, which is ramping up inflation) ever since; while the Keynesian economists that run Japan (and are now starting to take over America) pretend that pumping more money into the system is the ony way to save it. This economic theory -should- have been a lesson learned in the 1970s American stagflation, when Milton Friedman and his monetarist economics led to America's economic explosion in the 1980s and 1990s, but as it turns out, it is just more politically advantageous for politicians to simply promise their constituents a slice of the pie rather than tell them to go bake their own.|`|BKTx9IsZaa	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  +++++++++++++       +++++++++++++++++  +++++++++++            +++++++++++++++  ++++++++++               +++++++++++++  +++++++++                  +++++++++++...  ++++++++   ++++             ++++++++++...  ++++++++     +++              ++++++++...  +++++++     ++++++++          ++++++++...  +++++++    +++++++++++++++   +++++++++  ++++++    +++++++++++++++    ++++++++  ++++++ +++++++++++++++  ++   ++++++++  +++++  ++++++++++++            +++++++  +++++  +++ + ++ +++  +    +    +++++++  +++++  +++      +++ ++     +    ++++++  +++++  +++  +   +++ +++   +++    +++++  +++++  +++++ ++ +++ +++++++++  ++++++  +++++  +++++++++++++ +++++++  + +++++  +++++ +++++++++++++++ ++++++  + +++++  ++++++ +++++++++++++ ++++++    ++++++  ++++++  +++++++++       ++++++  +++++  +++++++++++++++++       +++++    +++++  +++++  + ++++++++++   ++++++  + +++++  +++++ +++++ ++++++++  ++++++    +++++  +++++ ++++++ +++++      ++++  +++++++  +++++ + + +++ +++  +++ +++++  +++++++  ++++++ ++ ++++    +++   ++++  +++++++  +++++++ ++++++++++++++++++     ++++++  +++++++++ +++++++++++ ++++     ++++++  +++++++++++ +++++++++++++              ++++++++++++ +++++++++++               +++++++++++++ ++++++++          _      ++++++++++++++  ++++        +   |      +++++++++++++ ++           ++  _       +++++++++++   +++         ++           ++++++++       ++++      +++           ++++++         +++++++  ++++           +++++          +++++   ++++            +++            +++++ ++++++            ++              ++++ ++++++            ++              ++++++++++               Obeyma.

Clinton started it during his Presidency, when at the urging of Jimmy Carter, Clinton signed the NAFTA , sending jobs to Asia and Mexico, because of the cheap labor.  At the same time giving MFN status to China, after Chinese espionage agents stole billions of dollars in technology from Silicone Valley, when caught the Chinese were considered persona non grata and given 48 hours to leave the country.  The usual custom is that the person has to leave the country on the next carrier that is leaving the country.  Bill Clinton may have prevented 9/22/2001, when he passed on two opportunities to assassinate Osama Bin Laden, Clinton was on his "private time" and couldn't be disturbed to give the order, that could have save 3,000+ lives.  Now we have Barack Obama, who is too inexperienced to be POTUS, and won't ask for help out of pride, daily making decisions, that send the country into a deeper recession with no relief in site.  Obama is talking about rewriting the Declaration of Independence and other things that he has no business addressing.  The Democratic Party is acting like the mafia, when they hold a 4 day 150 million dollar series of balls and parties, while people are without homes and jobs, and American soldiers and sailors are in harms way fighting against terrorism and insurgency.   Past administrations cancelled or toned down their balls and parties because of the country was at war or in a depression. Something the Obama administration should have considered, and would have made Obama look better and stronger.  Instead he sends billions overseas to fund abortions, when 10,000+ people are losing their jobs on a daily basis. Obama already stacked his Cabinet with retreads from the Clinton Administration, which should not have been done if Obama wanted to reach across the aisle in Bipartisan agreement instead of party cronies.  McCaskill, is another junior Senator, who has no idea in what she is doing, telling people that they can only earn a certain amount of money. The Demmocratic Party is slowly leading this country down the slippery slope of Depression, with their decisions that have nothing to do with helping the American taxpayers who put these people in their postions because they promised to help America get back to where it needs to be|`|MS5OBY9Waa	I know I sure didn't vote for it.

It isn't the government's power, it is the buinsesses wanting the bail-outs that agree to do it, if they want to feed at the trough.

To answer your question, the executive compensation limits being proposed would apply only to companies requesting and accepting federal bailout money. This is to ensure those companies don't take your tax dollars and use the to pay out huge bonuses that line the pockets of the executives that ran them into the ground. If a company does not wish to agree to the limits, they don't have to take federal bailout money, and can instead try to find another way to work through their problems.    Companies that are doing well, and even companies that are doing poorly but find another way to deal with the problems, can pay their executives and other employees as much as the market will bear.|`|AA11105711	The answer is when those very same CEO's went to the federal government begging for money because of their failed businesses.

Jm3vMKx3aa	You have got a student visa issued valid from August 2008 until January 2010. If you are enrolled for next September 2009 I assume your studies will take until December 2010. You cannot do that on your present visa. The United Kingdom operates a different visa system than the United States. Whereas you may enter the United States on the last day of your visa validation and the Immigration Officer determines how long you may stay you may only stay in the United Kingdom during the period your visa is valid.  I'm afraid you have to apply for a new visa covering the period of your studies since on your present visa you would have to leave the United Kingdom in January 2010.

kK4GG6Z2aa	No one is perfect..well I'm almost there ha!  For your country if would be great if Obama does bring in a national health system..its a huge challenge, but would be brilliant for the poor. However our National health system in the UK is under tremendous strain because of bureaucracy I see the whole world as getting sicker - and if there are no funds to help them then I see disaster on the way.  I believe the drug companies are taking the **ss in the cost of drugs.  I see governments bailing out banks that have used our money irresponsibly.  I see health care professionals losing hope with the amount of stress they are under. I see countries spending billions on warfare and I think we will continue to see things slowly collapse.  I see governments totally wasting our taxes in every way. I can see a day when the elderly and chronically sick will be euthanized because there will be no finances or hospital beds to accommodate them.   We have just had a huge snowfall in the UK and the whole country seems to have come to a complete stand still...It is beautiful yet laughable that we can't cope...when you guys manage.  What a strange world we live in.    I see the European Union as a despotic group and eventually I believe there will be a one world government which will rule with an iron rod.  Free speech will go.  Our governments know everything about us don't they. We will become robotic through t.v. and rest of media as we are slowly being force fed lies and deceit not only by politicians but by film makers etc. BP have just announced they have made a record amount of profit..yet we still pay high prices for fuel.  Workers are now marching and protesting as immigrants are getting their jobs and loads of British workers are being made redundant...this I believe could end up in a race war in the UK if we are not careful.    What a depressing outlook I have - yet I am still up beat and happy.  It's yet another phase in this planets history - and the planet will survive one way or the other but I am not sure we will.  So I just live for today.  I see what worry does to people and I am not going there anymore.  People are living in fear and I think I may have said it before on this site...a country in fear is easy to govern as they listen to lies that pacify them.... Ho Hum back to the sleeping pills....(only joking about the pills that is the rest I am convinced of.  All the best to you..hope you are getting out more.|`|PI8VfiY1aa	I understand your point, and to an extent I agree with you.    But this time around, as silly and as futile as it may seem, I have hope.    Perhaps I'm setting myself up for disappointment- but until I'm proven wrong I will continue to hope for the type of administration that proves the cynics wrong. America is more than a group of citizens led by the corrupt. Whether our politicians have made mistakes in the past, I have hope that America will be the land our forefathers envisioned.     If we hit a few roadblocks along the way, we will simply uphold their ideals, correct our mistakes, and "form a more perfect union."

Whatever your political opinion is, no candidate is going to be perfect unless you only look at the things you like.    That's what America did throughout the whole election--  The supporters of a candidate ignored all of the negatives flung at them by the opposition, whether they held merit or not.

If she had been elected, she would have learned over time and would have probably done just fine. I know she will be a force to be reckoned with in the Republican party during the next few years...and sincerely hope she runs for the Senatorial position from Alaska when the time comes.

You'd be hard pressed to argue that he was.  He did a few fiscally conservative things, but he did a lot of fiscally liberal (and therefore stupid) things.    By comparison, let's see what Obama's done so far in TWO WEEKS....    1) Threw a $170 million party (pre-inaugural, inaugural, and post-inaugural) funded by the U.S. taxpayers (i.e. us), all in the celebration that his skin color is a shade or two darker than that of his opponents.    2) Supported and rushed through Congress a $700 billion bailout that did nothing to stimulate the economy and only increased our debt.    3) Is currently pushing through an almost $900 billion "stimulus bill" filled with things like $200 million for re-sodding the national mall (b/c it got destroyed during the racist, taxpayer-funded party mentioned in  1 above).    4) His nomination of Bill Richardson didn't go well due to scandal, and Richardson stepped down.    5) His appointee to head the IRS (Tim Geithner) didn't pay $34,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    6) His nominee to reform health care (Tom Daschle) didn't pay $120,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    7) He spent millions building three (two decoys) new limos despite the fact that Bush had new limos built only a few years ago. These new limos get fewer than 10 mpg for you "green" folks out there.    8) He spent millions putting a basketball court into the White House.    9) Millions of his bailout money to Bank of America funded a large pre-Super Bowl party.    10) He nominated one of the most scandalous, unethical people on the planet to be Attorney General (Eric Holder). Holder pardoned a terrorist arms dealer in order to impress the dirt ball's defense attorney who was a close confidant of Al Gore in hopes that Holder would be nominated Attorney General if Al Gore won the Presidency after Clinton (Holder was deputy AG under Janet Reno). He also blatantly lied about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]). His ethical transgressions could fill a tome.    11) He nominated a bona fide member of the National Socialist Party of the U.S. to be in charge of the environment. Her name was quickly removed from the Socialist party web site shortly thereafter.    12) He's closing Gitmo while we're seeing former detainees back committing acts of terror against the U.S. and our allies. These 200+ current detainees will likely end up inside the borders of the U.S. as a result. Smart move.    13) We've seen the largest post-election stock market slump in recorded U.S. history.    Should I go on?    Ron Paul was the only fiscally conservative candidate who ran in the past election.|`|H0sPovWTaa	I can only think of one Republican who made a stink during Bush's spending Spree.  The party as a whole destroyed that title that they once deserved.    We're screwed there is no party for fiscal responsibility without the mass murder of the Corporate Oligarchy.  Won't ever happen.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	If so, they have a LOT of work to do.  The Republican Party has gradually been hijacked by the Christian extremists who do not care a flip about fiscal responsibility.  The last Republican president with a truly conservative administration was Dwight Eisenhower.  Nixon, Reagan and both Bushes had no knowledge of true conservative principles, even though they campaigned against Big Government and spending our tax dollars.   Each one of these Republican presidents made the government bigger and more intrusive, and they spent money like crazy.  They spent tax money to benefit the wealthiest Americans and they had no regard for the middle class.    If the Republican Party wants to become viable once again, they need to return to true conservatism - if this is possible now - and take their party back from the Religious Right, who only care about 2 issues:  same-sex marriage and abortion.  We need to have some true conservatives in the mix somewhere, especially in the Congress.  This will help bring about better legislation all around.
V4BaRBtnaa	yes, you can sue them, but what would the damages be?    There are very few cases were damages are presumed.    You have to prove damages.|`|AA10599026	Um, no, that's not a good case at all. You could have been added to a hotmail account as a result of your interactions with that employee over the defective product.    Either way, regardless of how and why it got out, there are a couple of things you need to know. One, an email address is not confidential information. If they distributed your social security number or something personal, maybe. But an email address doesn't hurt anyone if it gets out.  The second thing you have to remember is that in order to successfully sue someone, you have to have lost something, and you did not lose anything by this employee having your email address. If that employee started harassing you, maybe. If the email address was used to open fraudulent accounts, then you'd have a case.     But with what you described ... with no damages, you wouldn't win a dime. Your lawsuit would be a waste of court time and your money and would be thrown out of court.|`|F0uLexezaa	have you suffered a loss? what would you sue for? you need to suffer a measurable loss|`|O9QP6AoYaa	i guess it depends because if u signed i contract or something tht explained tht then no if not then yeah|`|E7c1ZvR2aa	It is possible because this person stole information from there employer for there own use.

a5efe275182115a58cc24e44f27eae2baa	It's always inadvisable to do these things without a lawyer, but the application should be fairly simple.    I would suggest that you go to the courthouse, get the papers, fill out as much as you can, then go up to the filing clerk and get her or his help filling out the rest. If you are extra friendly and the person is nice and not too busy, you may get the hints you need. then follow whatever instruction you get for serving the papers, filing the affidavit of service and appearing on the day.    Law schools often have clinics that provide free advice, if not representation, and you may also look into that (try it first).    Courts in some jurisdictions have duty counsel - if so go at opening and put your name on the list. it's not representation, but especially with family law where judges get extremely pi$$ed off at the number of self represented people wasting their time, so there is often someone who will help show you the ropes for free.    Some lawyers offer services cheaper if you do all the leg work - negotiate this in advance -- and promise that you will file all the papers, and fill out as much of the forms as necessary and then just use them for consultation...not great, but better than nothing.    Hope something in that is helpful.|`|KlGLSJruaa	You can file the paperwork yourself.  You just need time to find out the basics.  A few well place phone calls may help alot.

esOaJoqBaa	As a mortarman you are trained to use those systems, but they are not always being used.

You may very well fire a mortar in combat, but you will not just sit around a mortar pit all day waiting for that to happen.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Mortarmen are very much in direct combat. Mortars are integral parts of every infantry battalion, and as an 11-Charlie you'll be right in the thick of things. The current standard 81mm mortar has a maximum range of about 5,600 meters, and that's nothing in a fluid combat environment.    Mortar crews do carry other weapons, most often a member of the M-16 family like the M-4.

Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."  Thomas Jefferson    I have a story. In land far, far away where King Richard rules over all of the Land of Lincoln it was instituted that as of Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Two no one shalt have handguns in Chicago city limits....Since then it has been a city ordinance and the funny thing is Chicago just took over as city with the most murder in the US.  http://cbs2chicago.com/local/murder.rate...     I got this from another answerer on Y!A  This is a post from an Australian police officer...    Hi Yanks, I thought you all would like to see the now available data  from Down Under. It has now been one year (12 months) since gun   owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal  firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing  Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.     The first year results are now available:  -Australia-wide, homicides are up 6.2 percent;  -Australia-wide, assaults are up 9.6 percent;  -Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent);      In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up      300 percent as compared with the last one year period when private      ownership of a firearm was legal.     (NB: the law-abiding citizens did turn in their personal firearms,      the criminal element did not and thus criminals in Australia still      possess their guns.)   -While data for the 25 years preceding the confiscation of privately  owned guns showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms,    this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months as criminals   now are assured their victims will be unarmed.   -There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults   of the elderly, while the resident is at home. Australian politicians are   at a loss to explain how public safety has  decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in  successfully ridding Australian society of guns.'   -This story of well intentioned government intervention in the   rights of lawful individuals to own and possess firearms won't be seen in the  mainstream US media or on the American evening news. Senator Obama   who advocates a similar confiscation in the US will not be reporting   any of this to you. But, the Australian experience speaks for itself. Guns in the   hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws  affect only the law-abiding citizens.    Americans may want to take note before it's too late!  http://www.gunowners.org/hlr-au.htm     http://www.youtube.com/user/DOUGandFRIEN...|`|zVGhHomRaa	Against.

I'm down with Chris Rock's idea...make the bullets cost thousands of dollars. Less people would probably go around shooting people if it cost them that much.|`|AuWSKFIxaa	Think about this:  Most criminals do not care to fill out an application for a weapon (gun) and they don't. They will just go to the nearest street corner or black market and get one. GUN laws only effect the honest people and make it harder for them to get a weapon (gun).   Now, put yourself in this situation. Would you like to have to fill out paperwork, go through an investigation into your past, etc. and know that you are honest? Then have the criminal that didn't go through all that hold you or family at gun point and rob you because he/she didn't worry about the laws.   Remember: GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE!|`|m5FyTeYgaa	The current federal laws restricting the age of the purchaser, and the background checks for convicted felons, and the mentally ill should be adequate. Some states go even further with licensing and registration.     My son and I have both had firearm safety training, and I think it is a great start. Anyone interested in owning firearms should want to learn more about their weapons. You get to meet a lot of people with similar interests.    Anyone that wants a CCW should have to get special training for that purpose too. Just because you hunted for a few years doesn't mean you know how to handle yourself on the street.    I draw the line at federal licensing and registration. The federal government doesn't need to know what guns I own. It's none of their business, as long as I am not breaking any laws. That is my right to privacy, along with my right to keep and bear arms.|`|BrjZhySIaa	I'll chime in late here, and I apologize in advance for the long, well-thought out answer...    AGAINST.    It is fact that more than 6,500 times every day American citizens use a firearm to defend themselves. When you look at the statistics, that tells you firearms are used 60 times more often to protect lives than to take lives.    Think about this... Since 1900 at least seven major genocides have occurred resulting in the murder of 50-60 MILLION people:    *Ottoman Turkey, 1915-17; 1-4.5 million Armenians murdered    *Soviet Union, 1929-53; 20 million anti-communists and anti-Stalinists murdered    *Nazi Germany and Occupied Europe, 1933-45; 13 million Jews, Gypsies and Anti-Nazi murdered    *China, 1949-52, 1957-60 & 1966-76; 20 million anti-communists murdered    *Guatemala, 1960-81; 100,000 Mayan Indians murdered    *Uganda, 1971-79; 300,000 Christians and political rivals of Idi Amin murdered    *Cambodia, 1975-1979; 1 million murdered    In all seven instances above gun control laws were enforced BEFORE the genocide occured, in some cases decades before.    Look at the "Gun-free" zones... Virginia Tech; 32 innocents murdered because some nutjob was allowed to have free roam without any resistance due the law that guns were not allowed there.    Then look at New Life Church in Colorado Springs back in December '07...    Matthew Murray armed with an assault rifle, two handguns, smoke grenades, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammo walked into a church ready for his personal massacre. Had the church been a gun-free zone like VT, there would have been blood flowing from the building. BUT, the church loves freedom too, and allowed Jeanne Assam to carry her 9mm on her. Because of this, Assam engaged the madman as he came through the front door and thanks to her firearm and good aim, the bastard was taken down and the imminent crisis was successfully adverted.    BTW, it's SICKENING how the media reports this... http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=39827...    "Despite Shots From Security Guard, 24-Year-Old Murray Killed Himself"    Can you say....WTF?! This is an example of how liberal-leaning the media is.    How about... "Armed citizen saves the lives of hundreds!!!" or "Law-abiding citizen exercises her 2nd amendment right and becomes a hero" ... Can you imagine what the reports would have been had Ms. Assam did not have a firearm? Headline reads: "GUNS were responsible for the death of hundreds of innocent church-goers"    (I hate the media.)    Anyway....    Obviously bad guys do not pay attention to gun-free zones, except to note that such zones create a free-killing environment.    I can give you dozens of quotes off the top of my head from our founders who were strong proponents of gun ownership; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine, Samuel Adams....    Robert Heinlan summed it up best: "An armed society is a polite society."    But my favorite quote comes from the good Lord himself...    "He that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one" ~ Luke 22:36|`|oxmkllnWaa	I think we should go back to the days before the National Firearms Act (1934) anybody can have anything no questions asked.    My grandfather carried a rifle to church on Sunday (in the wagon circa 1910) and once shot a deer to help feed the family on the way (he dropped off the family at church and went back to field dress the deer).    An Armed Society is a Polite Society.|`|67EaIAvbaa	yes!!..there should be no guns in the house.|`|ugNH8FMYaa	I agree w/ poster  1.

AA11494150	They are all non-lethal, so voltage should not be a deciding factor. The extra voltage simply causes more discomfort.    I don't like the batons because there are larger, bulkier, and more difficult to use in close quarters. As far as the distance, if the person can still get their hands on you, that little extra bit of distance won't matter.    If you are that concerned about distance, get pepper spray or mace, if they are legal. Chose one that fires a stream, not a cone. The stream is more effective at a distance.|`|jhuNHP68aa	YOU ARE BETTER OFF WITH A 4 INCH .357 MAGNUM Lady Smith & Wesson revolver/ It's easy to shoot,load,and fire.

You're going to shoot someone with a stun gun, not knowing anything about this person from a distance? You can get sued, big time, if you use one of these not in self defense. I have never heard of a stun baton, but chances are they are not a good idea either.
c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Possibly.  As PJs are considered aircrew you will have to get waiver from the USAF Flight Surgeon's Office.  They are located in San Antonio TX.  You cannot even apply until at least six months have elapsed since your surgery.  If the Flight Surgeon doesn't like what your LASIK has done-you're done.  EDIT:  Actually it's the MAROON beret.|`|3xTNOevjaa	if it is corrected and does not come in interferring your duty, then you will be able to become a PJ.|`|gTuFxLKHaa	You should, remember the USAF PJs are not easy to get into theres a 90% washout rate. You gotta have a body of steel and iron determination, which is why PJ training is also called superman school, its no easy go.

I suppose you would support banning all sodas, except Coke and Pepsi, and making all of us choose between those 2, just because those 2 are the largest.    In their last turn at bat, the GOP went on a hog wild spending spree, and gave us a bloated new entitlement we can't afford, called the Senior Prescription Drug Benefit.  The Dems in power now only promise even more programs and spending.    Where does the voter who actually favors a smaller government go these days?|`|LnoyylQ7aa	cause in america it actually is a wasted vote|`|0qSpreVyaa	A third party steals potential voters from the other two parties.

However, I'm a firm believer in what you throw out, you should at least take what is good before you send the rest to the trash.  One mans trash is another man's treasure.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	I think it's great.  It might bring about cures for a lot of things.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	So far, it hasn't worked.    But at least, it uses the bodies of aborted babies that would otherwise be just wasted.    Stem Cells is Scam.  But it gives people "hope".|`|SLTlvqRlaa	I hope it happens because then I wont have to be diabetic anymore :)|`|vYVkf2Eraa	You need to differentiate between embryonic or adult stem cells.  So Far all the hype is to develop the embryonic but that has achieved very little and there is the ethical end as well, a life would have to die.     Moreover, adult stem cells are already being used clinically to treat many diseases in human patients. These include as reparative treatments with various cancers, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, and arthritis, anemias including sickle cell anemia, and immunodeficiencies. Adult stem cells are also being used to treat patients by formation of cartilage, growing new corneas to restore sight to blind patients, treatments for stroke, and several groups are using adult stem cells with patients to repair damage after heart attacks. Early clinical trials have shown initial success in patient treatments for Parkinsons disease and spinal cord injury. And, the first FDA-approved trial to treat juvenile diabetes in human patients is ready to begin at Harvard Medical School, using adult cells. An advantage of using adult stem cells is that in most cases the patients own stem cells can be used for the treatment, circumventing the problems of immune rejection, and without tumor formation.    Everyone from the time they are born have adult stem cells.  These cells are what your body uses to replace worn out, or damaged cells. Each single adult stem cell can either divide into another stem cell or produce a thousand tissue cells.

Those loans represent investment in the housing stock of the USA and  were propping up declining  values.    3. The major stimulus package the economy needed was the drastic drop in oil prices and the recognition that the investment bank and oil company owned  oil futures trading market in London is manipulated and not reliable and its loss of influence in setting prices.   4.

Now everyone is figuring out what "Change" he had in mind. Everyone was excited and America forgot their problems and assumed he would knock out the recession in the first day of office. Wake up call for everyone... he can't do any better than anyone else. I don't care how much he talked about change change change... he says change more than the hobo sitting at the 51st street subway entrance! He also gets similiar results... nada! Just wait a while... in the months to come you will all realize who he is going to make the big changes for. It will not benefit any of us. Let's do some math. $350 BILLION + 820 BILLION = 1.17 TRILLION DOLLARS. We are currently 10 TRILLION and change in debt. That's 10,000,000,000,000.00  WOW that's a huge number! Anual taxes net the government roughly 1.5 - 1.8 TRILLION DOLLARS. With the recession that figure will be on the lower side I would imagine. If we cut taxes we can reduce that figure even more. If we spend 1.17 TRILLION giving it to banks that most of us will never get a loan from or even do bussiness with; maybe AIG can just sit on a few hundred billion forever or embezel it. For all the jets and vacation get-a-ways we know the fat cat executives are using OUR money for... there are probably 100 incidents we will never know about. Our taxes will be paying the salaries of people we would prefer be in prison for the garbage they pulled in helping cause the recession to start with. Now you want to know why Obama's numbers are slipping? I hope I just hit the nail on the head!  1.17 TRILLION divided by the estimated number of households in America (Around 75,000,000)(That is an estimate) would mean every house hold in the US could receive $15,600 in the mail. Everyone for the most part would spend a lot of that money. THAT would stimulate the economy. If one wanted to factor in income and only give a share of the money to those making less that $150,000 per year (Makes sence to me... I make over that and wouldn't mind one bit if the Government helped good people out) The checks would increase quite a bit. I do not condone the nationalization of our banks... the American people didn't get any stock for their investment. We all have to pay the bill, yet we hardly even know where the money went really. Why not just give the people being effected the hardest by the DEPRESSION some help, and thereby help the country get out of this rut we will end up being stuck in for the next decade?

YEA RIGHT!|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	With all except those that they can lure into a closet or meet in a men's room.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	yeah look at this stimulus package and you tell me who is out of touch      Even some Democrats are now objecting that the measure contains too few highway and mass transit projects. Moreover Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moodys Economy.com, says most of the infrastructure spending in the plan wont occur until 2010 or later. Provisions of the bill that many legislators are questioning: $1 billion for Amtrak, which hasnt earned a profit in four decades. $2 billion to help subsidize child care. $400 million for research into global warming. $2.4 billion for projects to demonstrate how carbon greenhouse gas can be safely removed from the atmosphere. $650 million for coupons to help consumers convert their TV sets from analog to digital, part of the digital TV conversion. $600 million to buy a new fleet of cars for federal employees and government departments. $75 million to fund programs to help people quit smoking. $21 million to re-sod the National Mall, which suffered heavy use during the Inauguration. $2.25 billion for national parks. This item has sparked calls for an investigation, because the chief lobbyist of the National Parks Association is the son of Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wisc. The $2,25 billion is about equal to the National Park Services entire annual budget. The Washington Times reports it is a threefold increase over what was originally proposed for parks in the stimulus bill. Obey is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. $335 million for treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. $4.19 billion to stave off foreclosures via the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The bill allows nonprofits to compete with cities and states for $3.44 billion of the money, which means a substantial amount of it will be captured by ACORN, the controversial activist group currently under federal investigation for vote fraud. Another $750 million would be exclusively reserved for nonprofits such as ACORN  meaning cities and states are barred from receiving that money. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., charges the money could appear to be a payoff for the partisan political activities community groups in the last election cycle. $44 million to renovate the headquarters building of the Agriculture Department. $32 billion for a smart electricity grid to minimize waste. $87 billion of Medicaid funds, to aid states. $53.4 billion for science facilities, high speed Internet, and miscellaneous energy and environmental programs. $13 billion to repair and weatherize public housing, help the homeless, repair foreclosed homes. $20 billion for quicker depreciation and write-offs for equipment. $10.3 billion for tax credits to help families defray the cost of college tuition. $20 billion over five years for an expanded food stamp program. Republican leaders say the stimulus package will add 32 new government programs at a cost of $136 billion. They object that many of the programs, once established, are likely to continue indefinitely. Most media outlets are reporting the cost of the package at $819 billion. As Newsmax revealed yesterday, however, the Congressional Budget Office calculates that the interest on the debt generated by the bills spending will cost another $347.1 billion, making the total cost approximately $1.17 trillion. Of course, the measure contains hundreds of billions in tax cuts and infrastructure projects that conservatives will find palatable. But as House Minority whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., told the media Wednesday, This was not a stimulus bill. It was a spending bill.|`|IrfbapHAaa	tottally.|`|W28ALDEmaa	No.   We vote for what we think is best for this country.   Like, making people actually work for there money and not killing baby's just because a little slut couldn't keep her legs closed.     & We also aren't raciest and Narrow-minded like you liberals are.|`|0nsfvY48aa	No, actually more Americans consider themselves conservative than liberal.
lpwcqkNbaa	No,Obama's election is the best thing happening for Fox News, now they have something to whine about 24/7 so that its listeners will feel better on a daily basis|`|8gaPElwxaa	What the heck did they lose?|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Fox News don't gots the grapes to admit they lost.|`|13db40225fc025aff3b81b2609fc6918aa	I didn't know that the Fox news channel had run for a position.I would have voted for them had I known.  I understand how frustrating it is to hear a dissenting opinion about Obama,but there are other opinions out there and some are gasp facts and not liberal spin.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	Lost what?  Their dominating spot in the cable news industry?  Because if that is what you are talking about, they didn't lose.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  People are flocking to FOX News after seeing how truly biased, unethical, and downright corrupt every other news network has been in overtly supporting Barack Obama's candidacy.    I never believed in political media bias until this election cycle.|`|7mOfekBWaa	Did you see when Obama was declared the projected winner? They zoomed out and away from the announcers. LMFAO it was classic. Then they did a special where they focused on Bush going into his plane...landing the plane...getting out of the plane...watching him walk places....then leaving.  It's the definition of sad.|`|A0825FVZaa	Boy do you have it all wrong. By Obama winning their ratings are  1.51 million people did NOT vote for Obama, remember that!|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	lost what - the ratings -- nope they are rather high up there in comparisson to CNN.

They were number two last week in ALL cable programming.    Fox swept the election coverage ratings.    American Idol (Fox) had 47% more viewers on Inauguration Day than the Inauguration itself.    Fair and Balanced    MSNBC managed a dismal Twenty Second.    Gotta love those sour grapes.|`|W28ALDEmaa	I think your the sour Grape.   What exactly was Fox news running for?  Fair and Balanced Media coverage?   Then No, They Won.   Because the rest of the Networks are Biased, liberal  brainwashing "news" coverage.   So go chew on your sour grapes, and drink your damn Kool-aid.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	what? they are as close to fair as you can get.......suppose you like cnbc the obama channel|`|gOSGjqMvaa	Wrong category there Top Contributor of "Reality TV."

They're winning what they want, when they want, and the dumbing down of the USA is how they are achieving this.    TOP CONTRIBUTOR?  shouldn't you know better?  'nuff said, don't wish to insult, just to express my being insulted, hope you take it in that same vein.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	You're kidding, right?  Fox News is the best on cable.  They are fair and balanced, and after the election, their numbers showed that they actually gave Obama more "time" than McCain.  You can't say much for CNN and MSNBC about giving McCain more time than Obama.  My God, they would rather disintegrate....which, by the way, they seem to be doing on their own.|`|DBIKou8faa	What did they lose?  What were they running for?  Did I miss something?    If it's already getting under your skin then get a grip, Fox News is going to be a big old thorn in your side for the next 4 long years.....ouch!|`|AA11598520	The Fox channel wasn't running for anything so I guess what type of grapes it is would be a moot point.|`|Q3Wrg1R6aa	Fox/Fake News is becoming a dinosaur just like the republicans whom they kiss up to everyday.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	lol  fox did not lose anything   trust me   in 4 years i hope you ask yourself did the change happen or was it just media hype that the sheep followed|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	No Barry's win ensures them higher ratings for at least the next four years.

I don't agree with everything he had done, but all in all I feel he was a fine president.    ATTENTION: Obama makes Bush look like a penny pincher. And to argue that Obama is just like Bush means that you just voted in four more years of the same. Where is the change? What did people who hate Bush vote for exactly? You need to pick an angle and stick with it.  You're all over the place.|`|oTqZm4NFaa	Some people.. me personally - no not really.
jHWpNL9Iaa	You're being too logical for them to understand.|`|HGnWKRzyaa	Good point. Why wasn't the media trying to persuade voters not to vote for Bush unless... *gasp* maybe the media doesn't persuade voters. Maybe voters have minds of their own and flashy pictures don't fill them like pez dispensers...|`|1yov0JF9aa	if the media is not biased, then why have we not heard about Michel Obama's court ordered disbarment.|`|0nsfvY48aa	I wouldn't say the media is responsible for Obama winning, but all I have to do is talk to a few uninformed people to see the effect that the media has on many people. All they can do is spew one liners that they either read on their internet home page or a sound bite they heard on tv.|`|AA11477972	Everybody thought Saddam had WMD's including the Brits and Russians, so that's beside the point. Yes the liberal media very much helped point the American people in favor of the messiah Obama, and since the we as a whole are intellectually lazy, it really worked. The media had us convinced that the economic problems where Bush's fault even though it was democratic policies that got the ball rolling on the whole thing. It was Bush's fault that he didn't stop these stupid policies when the republicans had the majority, I can't imagine people actually believing the this was the repubs fault, when democratic policies forced banks to issue risky loans. Anyway, that was one of the biggest factors, but of course there are others. Funny, the only news outlet that I saw show any criticism at all was Fox. They were the only ones who showed both sides, everybody else was bending over backwards to get him elected, and liberals still hate Fox for that. I used to watch CNN, but by the time the elections were rolling around i couldn't sit through an hour without getting sick to my stomach. And MSNBC is the laughing stock of the nation, even thier so called hardline news leans so far to the left they couldn't stand up with out falling over. The regular networks don't fare any better either, and don't get me started on the print press. Public broadcasting is a farce too, I was listening to the story about a senator taking bribes, and they never told what party she was. I had to look it up on the internet and even the AP story didn't mention she was a democrat until right at the end of the story. Of course the very next story in big letters said, "Republican lobbiest jailed on corruption". So some try to be subtle, while others flaunt thier sickening partisanship. And if the viewers are not at least a little politically savy, the don't cath these things and end up part of the kool-aid drinking American sheeple. Sad but true.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Really it was either Gore or Bush not a big competition there. It was either Global Warming boy or the son of an Ex president.  2nd time around it was either Finish the Fight Bush or I hate the military I threw away all my medals Kerry. And we were in a middle of a war. Not a big competition there.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	Well, the Dems had Herman Munster running against Bush.  They certainly didn't want to bring themselves down any further by favoring him, so they kinda just let Bush alone.  And well they should have.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	The liberal media tried their best to steal the election for Gore. They just didn't have a bad enough economy or a charismatic candidate like they did in 2008.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	the liberal media did not support bush at all  you really do not believe that the media loved and worshiped obama and only did what they could to make people believe he was the one  and voting against him would be racist?  you really believe that?  you must of been sleeping|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	"the media" is just an instrument....Obama played them like Clapton ... McCain played them like my neighbor's kid who thinks he's Clapton but in reality just sucks...    let us not dismiss entirely, however, the notion of "bias."  You may recall that the general feeling among the network talking heads was one of shock as they reported Bush's 2nd Term victory.  And many of the news stories the following day were the "how did this happen?" variety, rather than the "look at historical facts regarding encumbents engaged in a War, unpopular or not."    The reason media bias is more pronounced than before is that they are all owned by mega-corporations that are ruled by business models...not journalistic standards.|`|Q3Wrg1R6aa	They crumbled under Bush fear tactic campaign.    We know better now.      President Bush will be remembered as the worst president in history.|`|lpwcqkNbaa	Don't buy all the BS they say.These things are just excuses for their loss  they simply can't accept the fact that they lost fair & square|`|oTqZm4NFaa	When Bush had his Inauguration he spent $42 million and was labeled all sorts, when Obama spent $120 in this economic mess, he was praised.    The media IS liberal, the only reason you are arguing that FACT is because you dont want to agree with the opposition.    I say you should research for these headlines and then you will find this question is far from logical.|`|DHe3SBCmaa	Dissatisfaction with Bush, a Favorable Media and a skilled liar (Obama) all pllayed a part in the election    Last election the disatisfaction was low, and you had a very unskilled liar in Kerry    You need at least 2 out of three to sway the doofuses  Re Clinton    And I can admit we lost .

He isn't one of the people who endorses trickle down economics during the age of globalism. He wants to try to keep US money in the US.    Republicans don't like that. And that's why now we not only import oil, we import everything. And republicans want to keep it that way.      http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090202/pl_...      Jobs are needed. And the republicans want to make sure the Chinese get them.|`|Q3Wrg1R6aa	He will destroy the republicans.|`|YupMCYHlaa	1.  He was a professor of constitutional law at our greatest university.  This means not only that he is brilliant and hard-working, but that he has  some understanding of our Constitution and won't see it as 'just a goddamned piece of paper'.  Both of these things make him a HUGE improvement over his predecessor.    2.  Going back 100 years at least, Democratic presidents are historically more honest, more diligent, and more competent than Republican presidents.  This is partly because Republicans do better at keeping an opposing president honest, keeping him reined in.  You can see how Republicans, even with minorities in Congress, worked to keep Carter and Clinton honest (relatively) while the Democrats in Congress were not able to keep Bush on the reservation.  The Bush administration was completely out of control.  This is one more good reason to vote Democratic.    3.  Obama is black and has a mildly Arabic name.  This will make it easier for us to deal with Arabic countries, African countries, Islamic countries, etc.  Obama doesn't need to establish American superiority in the Middle East.  He doesn't have to base his foreign policy on the principle, so popular with Republicans, of Might Makes Right.  Arabic and Muslim people won't be as likely to think the US is declaring war on them, personally, or trying to destroy their culture or ethnic identity.    4.  Obama sounds like he will judge his own success based on how well the average guy does, rather than how rich his own friends get.  But how well he does remains to be seen.|`|V7JVKApkaa	He'll make us poor,   then gone in four.

He's the most corrupt individual in the U.S. Department of Justice!

He also blatantly lied on live TV about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]).

When the Republican Party moved away from the Contract with America is when they lost Congress.  So a lot of the great economic times you are touting happened under a Republican controlled Congress. (sucks doesn't it)|`|cMHxg372aa	The current collapse was made inevitable due to fiscal policy decisions made between 2001-2006; specifically, the tax cuts during war time. Additionally, deregulation played a major role, as unbridled speculation causes credit creation to drive out productive economic activity - for this, Clinton shares the blame with Reagan and W. I lay quite a bit of indirect and direct blame on Reagan as well, who created the cultural and political environment in which this sort of thing could occur. The final important factor was monetary policy actions from 1987 to 2008, which have centered around creating and maintaining the biggest debt bubble in human history. All in all, I'd roughly apportion blame per administration and the pertainant congresses roughly as follows:    Clinton - ~15%  Reagan - ~25%  W. Bush - ~60%    As for the Dem congress from 2007-2009, no. I'm not being political here, it's just that they came in as the bubble had already begun bursting; furthermore, they weren't able to get an consequential economic legislation passed.|`|73kknl3Qaa	sure

A Tale of Two Houses        House  1A 20 room mansion ( not including 8 bathrooms ) heated by natural gas. Add on a pool ( and a pool house) and a separate guest house, all heated by gas. In one month this residence consumes more energy than the average American household does in a year. The average bill for electricity and natural gas runs over $2400. per month. In natural gas alone, this property consumes more than 20 times the national average for an American home. This house is not situated in a Northern or Midwestern "snow belt" area. It's in the South.      House  2  Designed by an architecture professor at a leading national university. This house incorporates every "green" feature current home construction can provide. The house is 4,000 square feet ( 4 bedrooms ) and is nestled on a high prairie in the American southwest. A central closet in the house holds geothermal heat-pumps drawing ground water through pipes sunk 300 feet into the ground.    The water (usually 67 degrees F.) heats the house in the winter and cools it in the summer. The system uses no fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas and it consumes one-quarter electricity required for a conventional heating/cooling system. Rainwater from the roof is collected and funneled into a 25,000 gallon underground cistern. Wastewater from showers, sinks and toilets goes into underground purifying tanks and then into the cistern. The collected water then irrigates the land surrounding the house. Surrounding flowers and shrubs native to the area enable the property to blend into the surrounding rural landscape.    ~~~~~  HOUSE  1 is outside of Nashville, Tennessee ; it is the abode of  the "environmentalist " Al Gore.     ?     HOUSE  2 is on a ranch nearCrawford, Texas ;  it is the residence the of the President of theUnited States,  George W. Bush.

It was a huge cash crop for centuries, George Washington grew it, it was the best fiber to make clothes, sails, rope, great stuff no problem. Until Capitalism popped up around the 1930s. Just like every law in this BS country it boiled down to money, no, not because it's right or wrong but because of money.    1930s Dupont obtained patents for making nylon from coal, paper from trees and plastic from oil, and didnt want to see hemp as a potential competitor. Remarkably but not surprisingly, the companies chief financial backer at the time, Andre Mellon, owned large swathes of timber land and oil. Mellon appointed his nephew-in-law Harry Anslinger to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics while other Dupont backers such as the Hearst newspaper group began to influence public opinion towards the perceived evils of marijuana. This also saw the rise of the pulp fiction novels with wonderfully lurid covers and titles such as I was a slave to marijuana and films such as Reefer Madness.    Basically this propaganda strategy worked and in 1937 Congress outlawed hemp. The actual science was buried.    Now I just know that some brainwashed sheep turd is going to say, "No! My government is protecting me from myself." Lat year 147 people died from being hit on the head by a coconut, 150,000 people died from tobacco, 500,000 died from alcohol related deaths, but not 1 person died from a marijuana overdose. In fact no one has ever died from an overdose, but, many have died due to the "illegalization" of marijuana, and there are roughly 500,000 people in prison due to the illegalization of a plant that helps more than it hurts, but cuts into the profits of a few kleptocratic corporations.|`|0kTx9pAvaa	Thats always been one of my firm beliefs on mary jane, just the fact that the government won't make any money off of it.

And where in the world did you get that we owed 700 billion to China?  That's not even close to accurate.|`|qPLYoBdyaa	we should bring bush back to fix the mess obama created. This downturn isnt from outsourcing jobs dude, its from ACORN coming up with the community reinvestment act. Do a little research for the love of god. And raising taxes and going further into debt isnt gonna help the economy|`|AA10282820	How about we give Obama 4 years to see if he can actually do what he said before annointing him. I see you have already given him an out for potential failure.  Unfortuantely, the outsourced jobs you mention were caused by the second-highest corporate tax rate on the planet. If you owned a business, would you not try to keep your costs low? That's Business 101. A corporate tax reduction would bring many of those jobs back but according to the Pelosi gang, raising taxes is the only answer..  It is the only answer when the question is, "How can we give more to those who have not earned it while simultaneously  punishing people and companies that are financially successful on their own merit?"  They have failed to tell the public that a successful business creates jobs which in turn, creates employees that pay taxes on their wages and goods purchased. Higher corporate taxes = less jobs = less tax revenues.    As you sit in relative safely behind your keyboard second-guessing the decisions of our leadership (all of whom have and will continue to err, not just former President Bush), consider that our military efforts and the lives of those who bravely stood in our defense made your safety and freedoms possible. Many around the globe do not have such luxuries.      Quit drinking from the liberal watercooler, it appears to be tainted.|`|482oQASHaa	Well i always thought republicans are bitter|`|yHwUbD6Saa	Let's see what Obama's done so far in TWO WEEKS....    1) Threw a $170 million party (pre-inaugural, inaugural, and post-inaugural) funded by the U.S. taxpayers (i.e. us), all in the celebration that his skin color is a shade or two darker than that of his opponents.    2) Supported and rushed through Congress a $700 billion bailout that did nothing to stimulate the economy and only increased our debt.    3) Is currently pushing through an almost $900 billion "stimulus bill" filled with things like $200 million for re-sodding the national mall (b/c it got destroyed during the racist, taxpayer-funded party mentioned in  1 above).    4) His nomination of Bill Richardson didn't go well due to scandal, and Richardson stepped down.    5) His appointee to head the IRS (Tim Geithner) didn't pay $34,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    6) His nominee to reform health care (Tom Daschle) didn't pay $120,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    7) He spent millions building three (two decoys) new limos despite the fact that Bush had new limos built only a few years ago. These new limos get fewer than 10 mpg for you "green" folks out there.    8) He spent millions putting a basketball court into the White House.    9) Millions of his bailout money to Bank of America funded a large pre-Super Bowl party.    10) He nominated one of the most scandalous, unethical people on the planet to be Attorney General (Eric Holder). Holder pardoned a terrorist arms dealer in order to impress the dirt ball's defense attorney who was a close confidant of Al Gore in hopes that Holder would be nominated Attorney General if Al Gore won the Presidency after Clinton (Holder was deputy AG under Janet Reno). He also blatantly lied about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]). His ethical transgressions could fill a tome.    11) He nominated a bona fide member of the National Socialist Party of the U.S. to be in charge of the environment. Her name was quickly removed from the Socialist party web site shortly thereafter.    12) He's closing Gitmo while we're seeing former detainees back committing acts of terror against the U.S. and our allies. These 200+ current detainees will likely end up inside the borders of the U.S. as a result. Smart move.    13) We've seen the largest post-election stock market slump in recorded U.S. history.    14) Iran is mocking us as weak and negotiating with terrorists.    15) Russia, Venezuela, Cuba, and Iran are posturing since the election (passing Russian ships through the Panama canal, Russian meetings with Chavez, etc.).    16) Israel felt it necessary to abruptly invade Gaza and start a war to help themselves before Obama $&* s up our middle east policy by taking office.    In summation.....    In 2 weeks, we're viewed as weak internationally, the economy has plummeted faster than in any post-election period in recorded U.S. history, we're poised to double the deficit of Bush, and we've nominated and confirmed corrupt, tax-evading dirt balls to Obama's cabinet!

Sure, its a shame that people are losing their jobs, but if you want to create jobs, you have too make business possible. To many restrictions on business hinder growth. Those people who lost their jobs with the recession could find themselves re-employed if businesses find they need to expand.     It all comes down to whether or not you believe Reaganomics work. After what happened in the 80s, I certainly believe it works.     Bush spent a lot of money though... no denying that.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Why did you criticize Bush for things that Congress did?

He already HAS gotten more jobs and in the weeks he's been our president, he's done WAY better than any other republican would've done in 8 years. They're all just bitter & mad at the fact they were wrong. Honestly, McCain was so stuck up and immature, he wouldn't even care about the country, only his title.    Not only that, but President Obama has been getting jobs for the unemployed at places that help the environment. He's already making a huge difference that's great for this country, so republicans need to get over the fact they're wrong and be thankful they have a new, amazing president.     :)|`|KVHtWENnaa	You honestly think this is all Bush's fault?

Then the last two years of Bush's term the Libs took over Congress, they ran things there way, and the economy took a major nose dive.    The Liberal/Dems created this world economic disaster with their 'loans for diversity' fiasco, and refused all dire warnings from the conservatives for regulations:    Timeline shows Bush, McCain warning Dems of financial mess:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPSDnGMzI...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGT_cSi7...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMnSp4qEX...  __________________  __________________    "In times of universal deceit, telling the truth will be a revolutionary act." -George Orwell, '1984'    In Liberal/Leftist politics, reality is an inconvenience best ignored.

JDltTREfaa	You can TRY to withdraw your guilty plea but I think it's pretty unlikely that a judge would allow you to do so.    Remember Senator Larry Craig?  He initially pled guilty by mail because he was hoping to make the case go away quickly and quietly, and when the media caught wind of it he then tried to withdraw the plea.  The judge refused to allow it.  The guilty plea stood.|`|AA11622716	You can make a motion to change your plea but changing your mind is not grounds to withdraw a plea.  Instead, you would have to show that you did not know that you had the right to trial, or what sentences could be imposed.  The problem with that is that the judge probably asked you questions when you pleaded to make sure you understood.|`|SkOALXv9aa	Yes but it sounds like you are going to need an attorney.|`|Gezfmghuaa	Not speaking to the specifics of the case, what it comes down to is if you have been sentenced.  If you are already serving the agreed upon sentence, it is unlikely you will be allowed to change your plea (but still possible).      If sentencing is pending, you should be able to change your plea.  You will be asked why you are changing the plea and have to agree that you understand you will potentially be convicted and face the full penalty of charges.|`|EavKfuPdaa	Do you have any kind of evidence agents her besides the phone calls here's another suggestion I would have her investigated and find out what she is up to

Makes me sick that some illegals are getting citizenship free...its so not fair.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Legal immigration is generally good for the economy.    Illegal immigration is almost always bad.|`|jJaVPwdNaa	Both are in effect, it depends how corrupt the economic market is. Immigrants do the work nobody else wants to do, I doubt most of your population would do primary and menial labour (only if their lives literally depended on it.)    America was built on slavery and much of it's modern day infrastructure is developing a contemporary slave class of it's own. Illegal immigrants (officially speaking of course) don't exist in a country or government's eyes so they can be essentially be treated how they wish. Thus, corporations can get away with using them for back-breaking labour with very little pay, which creates greater profit and a bigger ecomonic turnout (corporations like these rule your country's economy.) So your country is rich off the backs of these people, and they laugh at your hatred and anti-immigrant sentiment.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	legal immigrants usually have marketable skills or capital.  Both are useful.  They are generally seen as good for the economy.    Illegal immigrants usually have neither and work as laborers for unscrupulous employers that cheat them out of the money they earn.  While Chico is usually good for Cut-rate Dan's Construction he is not so good for the over all economy.  And then there are the illegals who only come here to deal drugs.  Great for the economy, bad for the neighborhood.|`|M4kEHaKfaa	no matter if they are illegal or legal, this economy is going to hell. and we are worry about illegals, and we want to take their jobs, because we don't have jobs, so people who went to the college, are going to work in labor jobs, like dishwasher, busboy, cleaning bathrooms, washing cars, landscape jobs, etc.|`|ZGUkizjYaa	Immigration tends to be good for the economy.  An increase in the working population forces our american workers to work harder and increase their skills.  In addition, it forces wages down for more menial jobs, allowing small and large business to expand.  While many argue that illegal immigration hurts small business, they are the primary benefactor of cheap illegal labor, and the primary employer.    The major problem with illegal immigration is that it is incredibly dangerous, and brings in crime, which is a deterrent to the economy.  However, the benefits outweigh the costs, and legal immigration procedures should be expanded so that we can reduce the number of illegal immigrants and reduce the criminal ones coming into our country.|`|qPLYoBdyaa	legal immigration is good for the economy. illegal immigration is bad for the econonmy. simple as that|`|IRiSE0qlaa	America is MADE of immgrants.

If they are no longer alive and legally competent, the trust is no longer revocable.  That said, a properly written trust will have procedures for replacing the trustee if they misuse authority or neglect their duties.  As a last resort, interested parties can ask the court to replace the trustee of ANY trust.

They just find it easier to let someone else do it. That is going to be our downfall.    And, I hate to say it, but I think a lot of people here on YA talk big...but do nothing.

gasquENMaa	Hello Julia. I work for the state of Ohio. The inmates in state prisons make a little over 11 cents an hour ( 11cents X 8 hours X 20 working days in a month = $17.60) State pay is $18 a month. Inmates do not make enough money to qualify to pay taxes, so the answer to your question  is NO, they pay no taxes while incarcerated.     I hope this helps and you can find it useful|`|JgnFCxD0aa	I'm sure they do, but for a few cents an hour it probably doesn't add up to the point they even need to file taxes.|`|Eh7I0a9Maa	Why should they?

If the warrant had never been issued, and they never looked for you, Statute of Limitations would apply.  Since the warrant was issued, they obviously looked for you, that warrant will not expire until you are on a slab in the morgue.  Sorry.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	The definition of a felony is "anything you can spend more than 365 days in jail for"    a misdemeanor is something you can, at the most, spend 364 days in jail for.    The difference is a severe one, because a felony carries with it a lot more consequences. For one thing you are now a convicted felon and get to say so every time you apply for a job. You can also loose your right to vote and to own a firearm, though a lot of states have taken to restoring felons right to vote, it depends on the state what the requirements are.    Also, as a rule, felons go to prison, time for misdemeanors can be served in your local county jail.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Felony is much more serious.

He brings up many good points and some bad ones.  Most of us are open-minded and like hearing a diverse group of opinions rather than the same liberal opinions we hear on every other network.  I like to mix it up and hear what all sides think.  Limbaugh is way too maligned in the mainstream media and in the Democratic party.|`|wl1wVZ4Haa	No, but he takes his drugs seriously.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Yes, Obama and his hordes of Worshipping Democrats do.

6FpUuLknaa	Because making it legal would make too much sense, and our government is not in the business of making common sense.  But there are plenty of prescription drugs that can closely mimic the effects of cannabis, so get some health insurance and buy the drugs the government endorses.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	People in America are lazy and overweight as it is...we don't need to encourage that.|`|TKbYavhzaa	Marijuana-related incarceration costs the US an estimated $1.2 billion/year (1). Police, DEA, and customs also add to the cost illegalization. So, savings could be achieved through decriminalization.    But legalization would open up a massive stream of revenue. The USA consumes roughly 14,000 metric tons of marijuana/year (2). Street price varies widely, but hypothetically let's say $100/ounce (~$3.50/g). Government-regulated farms would probably cost a negligible fraction of that. So, let's assume a post-legalization sales price of $3/gram, of which 80% is federal tax (the remainder being production, distribution, and vendor profit):    14,000mt = 14,000,000kg = 14 billion g x $3 x 0.80 = $33.6 billion. Of course, this is assuming that pre-prohibition levels were maintained.    Less tangible social benefits would include reduced incentive for gang crime, and reducing the 'gateway drug' effect (since marijuana users would no longer be purchasing from drug dealers).

An 'oversight' is an 'Oops, I forgot I had to do that." He forgot to declare the value of having a driver and car provided for him as income.

Senators from BOTH parties receive special privileges, which are unfair and wrong.  Unfortunately, the Democrats are playing the partisan game by downplaying Daschle's missteps.  I imagine that if he were a Republican, they would be up in arms.  The same goes for the opposite.  Congressional leaders look for any way possible to disguise their blatant partisan politics.
uh2bkRrFaa	You don't have to be driving to get the expired license ticket.     You have an expired license and you drink a lot that you can't remember things. You sound like a real winner.

Be careful and stop drinking.|`|AA11622716	You didn't sign or get it because it was mailed to you.  If you wish to plead not guilty, go ahead.  As to your question about being a passenger, it is not unlawful to be a passenger in a car with expired tags.  Because the ticket came in the mail, you are probably being accused of driving.  If you want to defend and claim someone else was driving, you are free to do so.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Maybe the ticket was for being drunk?      If you were too drunk to produce proof that you were over 21, that would be it.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	If you weren't driving but the car was stopped and all licenses were checked, you could have gotten a ticket for that.  Most cops will let you off with a warning though.  Call the number on it and it should tell you what the ticket is for.  They are usually automated.|`|TKbYavhzaa	I don't see how you could possibly get a ticket while being a passenger.  It could be from one of those red light camera things, if they misread your plates off someone else's car in the photo.|`|AA11313983	You don't need a license to be a passenger, so it's a moot point.  The ticket should say exactly what it's for.  If the car was being driven with expired plates, the ticket is warranted.|`|AuWSKFIxaa	IF it was your car and was a traffic light camera, the camera took your cars picture and the plate number registrant to that car got the ticket. What was the ticket for, you didn't say? Most tickets you don't have to sign, depends on state and country. In my state, we don't have to sign them. We just get them. No one will ever get a ticket for having an expired drivers license, unless they are the ones driving.   P.S. Being it came in the mail, it was probably one of the cameras mounted on the traffic light that caught the driver doing something not right.  Figure out who drove and take them to court, yours will probably get dismissed,,, but they could get the ticket instead. :(|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	next time - stay sober enough to know what you are doing.|`|I2fp6rCOaa	Take it to court and hire a lawyer.  Good Luck.|`|2wyDALHgaa	You don't need to sign anything to get the ticket.  Signing essentially just attests to the fact that you received one.  If you were NOT driving and were only a passenger then an expired license would not be a ticket able offense for you.  You only need the valid license if you are driving.    The ticket you received in the mail should list the offense.  Read it through and go from there.  If you don't feel you should have gotten this one then contest it.  Simple enough.

The problem with your suggestion is that for the individual states, it's a zero-sum game. Cutting taxes for states means they have to cut spending, which almost always induces them to neglect investments in human capital like healthcare and especially education. A situation then develops where companies look to states with higher taxes and strong public investment to recruit skilled labor, but then seek to move production to states without such investments. It's a zero-sum "race to the bottom."|`|4ojHnyZkaa	Who dim?|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No, this is not a surprise for Democrats.

yHwUbD6Saa	Delay?  Why even CONSIDER a bill like this after that last one rushed through Congress did NOTHING???    Let's see what Obama's done so far in TWO WEEKS....    1) Threw a $170 million party (pre-inaugural, inaugural, and post-inaugural) funded by the U.S. taxpayers (i.e. us), all in the celebration that his skin color is a shade or two darker than that of his opponents.    2) Supported and rushed through Congress a $700 billion bailout that did nothing to stimulate the economy and only increased our debt.    3) Is currently pushing through an almost $900 billion "stimulus bill" filled with things like $200 million for re-sodding the national mall (b/c it got destroyed during the racist, taxpayer-funded party mentioned in  1 above).    4) His nomination of Bill Richardson didn't go well due to scandal, and Richardson stepped down.    5) His appointee to head the IRS (Tim Geithner) didn't pay $34,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    6) His nominee to reform health care (Tom Daschle) didn't pay $120,000 in taxes that he owed, and Obama still supports him.    7) He spent millions building three (two decoys) new limos despite the fact that Bush had new limos built only a few years ago. These new limos get fewer than 10 mpg for you "green" folks out there.    8) He spent millions putting a basketball court into the White House.    9) Millions of his bailout money to Bank of America funded a large pre-Super Bowl party.    10) He nominated one of the most scandalous, unethical people on the planet to be Attorney General (Eric Holder). Holder pardoned a terrorist arms dealer in order to impress the dirt ball's defense attorney who was a close confidant of Al Gore in hopes that Holder would be nominated Attorney General if Al Gore won the Presidency after Clinton (Holder was deputy AG under Janet Reno). He also blatantly lied about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]). His ethical transgressions could fill a tome.    11) He nominated a bona fide member of the National Socialist Party of the U.S. to be in charge of the environment. Her name was quickly removed from the Socialist party web site shortly thereafter.    12) He's closing Gitmo while we're seeing former detainees back committing acts of terror against the U.S. and our allies. These 200+ current detainees will likely end up inside the borders of the U.S. as a result. Smart move.    13) We've seen the largest post-election stock market slump in recorded U.S. history.    14) Iran is mocking us as weak and negotiating with terrorists.    15) Russia, Venezuela, Cuba, and Iran are posturing since the election (passing Russian ships through the Panama canal, Russian meetings with Chavez, etc.).    16) Israel felt it necessary to abruptly invade Gaza and start a war to help themselves before Obama $&* s up our middle east policy by taking office.    In summation.....    In 2 weeks, we're viewed as weak internationally, the economy has plummeted faster than in any post-election period in recorded U.S. history, we're poised to double the deficit of Bush, and we've nominated and confirmed corrupt, tax-evading dirt balls to Obama's cabinet!    Should I go on?|`|9AY68T6Eaa	My guess is, since you provide no links, that you dont know what "pork" means, and certainly couldnt point out what "pork" you are against.    In addition, if the republicans are so against spending, why did they pass handouts for the banks?|`|SsB7aRExaa	Yes, but it won't.    For the good of the country we should all hope it does, though.|`|dtiJmx94aa	Yes, but our opinion, cares or concerns do not matter!|`|TFdKrkP2aa	There shouldn't be any delay. President Obama does not need to waste time on Republicans. We have Congress the Senate and the White House. We don't need Republican opinions or support their failed policies speak for themselves.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	The only thing that should delay it, is if it doesn't have enough votes to pass.|`|444pPdy5aa	Surprisingly the republican are pushing for the housing relief|`|NMaCcyeKaa	If modest differences shouldn't delay the stimulus, I don't know why Obama doesn't just take the questionable parts out.  Isn't leaving them in causing minor differences to delay the stimulus?|`|E9XL5x3Paa	The point of the stimulus is not spending.    You guys really should learn to start reading between the lines.  Obama is actually working for what Republicans want, but in a way that actually works.    Obama knows that kind of spending would never be approved, but then its not supposed to be approved.  The idea is to increase confidence in us.      Look, Democrats are supposed to initiate this by bringing the bill forward, making them look good when they see that the situation is dire enough to require action.  That increases their support among their constituents.    Then the Republicans are supposed to take away that pork you are complaining about, when they object to the spending.  That makes them look good when it shows them as being financially restrained again, bringing their constituents back behind them.    Then they get the new bill, free of the pork, before Congress again.  They vote, with a huge majority from both sides.  Then we gain confidence in the government and in the economy when we see them working together.  That we know they play games with each other, but that they know when to stop playing games and can get serious about really working together when the situation calls for it.  They work together, and then we gain that confidence.    And even before any spending is done, our confidence level moves up and that convinces customers to start buying again, investors to start investing again, and businesses to start hiring again.  Without any spending, and moving toward a private sector solution (restoring confidence so we do this ourselves), the whole thing is saved.          Only problem is, Republicans are not playing their part.  Now a huge part of that is Nancy Pelosi, who got screwed when Republicans were in charge and now intends to return in kind.  But Republicans are not helping anything when they throw their little temper tantrum about Pelosi and then refuse to do anything but complain.    It also isn't helping that Republicans are trying to ADD spending to the bill.  That wasn't what Obama was wanting them to do nor expecting them to do, and that definitely shouldn't be what they are doing.    Notice that when they complain about too much spending, Obama takes that part OUT of the bill.  But when Republicans try to add to the bill, he steps in the way.  To anyone paying attention, you can see what Obama is trying to do.  He needs Republican voters on board with this so they can get some confidence, too.  They are customers, business owners, and investors just like Democrats.  We need everyone gaining confidence, but it doesn't work if Republican Senators and Congressmen don't play their part.    They have to start cutting out the pork, as was their role when this plan began.  But they keep wanting to add to the pork instead, replacing the current pork with pork of their own.  That isn't what Obama wants, and sure as h*ll not what we need.    Republicans need to do what they have said they would do, which is CUT the pork, not replace it with more of their own.  Nancy Pelosi needs to get over herself.      This plan can work, Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans just need to pull their sh*t together.  And Republicans need to start acting like actual Conservatives, and start cutting instead of adding.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	I truly don't like being lied to by anybody just to get money.Front for Alfredo!!!|`|h9PVRHPWaa	fundamental differences should stop it.

Any manager trained properly will know that.|`|fgRtf9CIaa	if an employee did things wrong, there is nothing that prohibits the employer from not giving a good recommendation except for the threat of a lawsuit that would cost them money to defend.     It's called the telling the TRUTH!|`|pnpkJKvpaa	I don't think so. They have to tell the truth, however.|`|EbsekS7yaa	yes, it is true.      about the only negative thing they can say is that you are not rehirable.    that is the case in Texas anyway.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Depends what "Bad Things"  They say.        If its reasons that can be proven true (ie,  you were fired for stealing),  then yes,  they can mention this to potential employers.    If they are making stuff up or using opinions,   then they must keep it to themselves.    Other than immediate co-workers (who will likely simply be told that you were "let go"),   the only time this would really come up is in a reference.    Even in this case,   they would make a "no comment" or a "not hireable",  for the simple fact that they open themselves up to a lawsuit possibility if it gets back to the former employee (and is just not worth it,   they know to read between the lines.)|`|AA12071655	There's not a law against it, no, but so many employers have been successfully sued that most companies have a policy in place to not say anything beyond "yes he worked here" and "he is, or is not, eligble for rehire"|`|emNCaAq7aa	Not exactly a law but most companies, because of court decisions, will not say anything. My job will only confirm that I worked there.  If they say anything that reflects poor;y on you you can use. Most big companies with professional HR people know how to record a problem(s) with an employee contemporaneously which protects them but they still have to defend themselves.  So any smart company will say nothing.   There are costly web site companies that collect information on employee discipline and some industry groups also keep lists. They share the information, good or bad, with other members of the list. They insist on good reportage and keep attorneys ready to defend themselves,one of the reasons they are costly.|`|TGPTu1Suaa	The short answer is "no, there is no such law" (at least in much of the U.S.).  The accurate answer is more complicated, however.    There is a legal concept in the U.S. called defamation.  It is a complicated idea, but basically, it allows someone (here, the former employee) to sue someone else (here, the former employer) for making a false statement about him that causes him damage.    To minimize the risk of being sued, many employers have a policy of not giving any reference beyond confirming that the person worked there, for what period, and confirming a final salary.  That way, if the policy is followed, it is not likely that a former employee will sue, claiming he did not get a new job because the former employer said "he was really a terrible employee" or "I fired him for stealing" etc.
e7wD8sUiaa	Lower taxes for everyone including business. But that's not all, they should stop withholding taxes from our paychecks. Take a look at how much they take out of each of your checks and think about what you could do with that money. You could pay down high interest loans, credit cards, and other bills. Then you could actually save some money. You could put it into a savings account or invest it. You could share in the record profits of those evil oil companies. You can't do that when the government takes interest free loans from your check so you end up paying high interest rates to borrow money to pay for things you need. That interest is like a hidden tax.     This is also a good way to make sure people pay attention to how the government is spending THEIR money. If people have to write a check every year to the IRS, you can be sure they're going to know how much they paid and they will be watching what the government does with it.|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Lower taxes. cut spending in half. make persons on welfare and disability work for the check. and just because you are disabled dosn't mean you can not type|`|AA11288277	There has never been a Democrat that made sense...The best way to stimulate the economy is to do the exact opposite of what ever Obama, Pelosi, or Frank suggest.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Tax cuts don't fix bridges or build schools. BTW, there *are* tax cuts in the plan.    (I guess no one wants the bridges to be fixed...or schools to upgraded).    Only 30-40% of tax cuts get spent and act as a stimulus, so they're not very effective. Even Conservative economists like Martin Feldstein agree with this.    The Conservative, Nobel-Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman said "We are all Keynesians now." (meaning "the  government needs to spend a lot of money, and fast!"    You guys are just selfish and unpatriotic.|`|85kWzSzuaa	Lower taxes.

Bush's tax cuts pretty much bottomed out what we can get away with in terms of tax cuts, and they are still in effect.|`|zNB3tZXraa	The simple answer is lower taxes.However, Obama's plan is not stimulus. If he wants to give checks to people, especially people who don't pay taxes, thats not stimulus, it's spending, and that eventually needs to be paid for by the public. Creating  the jobs he wants, for the sake of putting a few people to work is not cost efficient, and will cost us more for the over priced product they supply, such as new windows for federal buildings, and new green cars for government employees. If you really have 6 hours to spend, read the stimulus bill, and see for yourselves what a waste of money it is.|`|cMHxg372aa	NO! It won't have ANY positive economic benefits, EXACTLY like how monetary policy is completely ineffectual at this point. Since consumers are deeply indebted, all tax cuts would do would be to convert private debt into public debt - it'd be nothing more than a handout to banks and financial institutions. The ONLY way for the government to stimulate economic activity at this point is for them to go out and actually SPEND, or rather, invest the money. This is a DEMAND-side problem. There is actually an excess of supply of consumer goods relative to effective demand, which is why prices are deflating; thus, SUPPLY-side measures are precisely the wrong policy prescription. At best, long-term tax rate cuts would do nothing, at worst, they would severely undermine confidence in the dollar and exacerbate the financial and economic collapse.    Now, on the supply side, we do have problems, but the problem is that there is an oversupply of consumer goods, and a massive undersupply of basic economic infrastructure, human capital, and commodities inputs, specifically energy. Obama's plans are inadequate to completely rectify the infrastructure, intellectual capital, and energy supply issues, but they are a good and necessary start.|`|D6alpa4Faa	lower taxes is a boat to nowhere. build something here.|`|207dFmdHaa	I would like lower taxes myself....|`|BLMh0dG6aa	A better economy will help everyone    Asking for billions for pet prodjects without allocating taxes, as the republicans do, gives trillions of dept and crashes the economy.|`|4zijn0cgaa	Lower tax rates are the only proven way to get out of a mess like this and spending pork plans have been tried many times by many countries only to prolong the disaster.|`|WTHTVJN6aa	Lower taxes.

Most people you know wouldn't know much without their education. Do you know the inventions we have thanks to the money that helped them come out of a persons head into our reality. We wouldn't have the internet we are using if not for the government & that means the people who get paid for working. Ask people what our tax money goes to & you will be amazed.

It was almost the equivalent of a bloodless coup. The federal government was never supposed to be as intrusive and powerful as it is. They surpass a king (the thing we fought the independence war for to get away from) by a longshot.  2)The constitution is toilet paper to politicians unless it leets their needs. Nopne of them obey it... as a whole the federal government only recogonises it when it is conveinent for them.  3) I need it to make a fire to make smores with. I bet that dried up peice of paper would be perfect! I want to see a real revolution in our country. We need a good civil war to shake things up. If we kill off about 100,000,000 of us then we may actually be able to fix the country. You think I am kidding? The power that be will never change... not really. Eventually the citizens and a chunk of the military will grow sick of their greed and corruption. If enough people are starving and dying in the streets they have nothing to lose. They will fight. It will happen. This depression we are in may be the catalyst someone needs to really unite our country under one common goal. Obama is not that guy... he is more of the same crap with a differant background.    Just a thought here: "Government of the people, for the people, by the people." The Government believes the American people are here for THEM. They are supposed to be here for us. WE are supposed to tell THEM what to do. It is not that way! I can not be the only person that can see this. We are slaves to them! All colors, all religions, all sexualities. They divide us to keep themselves in power. Keep working hard sheep ya sheep... make them all rich and more powerful!

AA10123414	To get emancipated, you will need to prove:  1. You are mature enough to manage your own affairs. This is demonstrated by things like a clean criminal record, good grades etc.  2. You can support yourself financially. You will need to show income and anticipated expenses.It is HIGHLY unlikely you have the income to rent an apartment, pay all utilities and put food on your table. You can NOT draw any public assistance if emancipated. The judge can rescind your emancipation if you go on public assistance after being emancipated.  3. That your welfare is better served by not being with your parents. Hating mom's rules will not meet this criteria.  4. That there are no other reasonable solutions to the issues at home.    In the states that actually allow emancipation you will need to be at least 16.    You will need to hire a lawyer to get you though the process.    You would need to file in a court that has jurisdiction over your parents or custodial parent if you do not live with both.     Only about 1 percent of emancipation petitions nationwide are granted.    Moving in with your parents instead of hers will not qualify her for emancipation.    If her mother has physically abused her, she needs to call the police EACH time it happens. Abuse is a crime and should be dealt with as such. If you don't feel it is serious enough to involve the police then she gets to stay there until she is 18.

99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	The US Navy and US Army have similar requirements to be a "line" officer.(one who commands) Most require a BA/BS but there are commissioning programs one can get into that do not require it  yet but do down the road. The USN however has the LDO program in which senior enlisted(E6 through E8) are commissioned as "technical experts" in their former enlisted field such as engineering or operations or deck. In these programs there is no degree requirement but it wold certainly help. The US Army has no such program but both have warrant officer programs with similar requirements. Army warrants have to be E5 with the aviation exception and Navy warrants are E7 or higher with twelve years minimum service. To compare promotion possibilities I would say that the Army is the better option generally as they are the biggest and have more slots. Just sheer numbers really.|`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	Ya need a degree to be an officer.|`|s7njWYEkaa	Navy|`|PBq7ODPzaa	To become a Second Lieutenant in the Army you have to have 2 years of college.

That's how it was six years ago, anyway.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	In all services you need a BA or BS to become an officer, no exceptions.  Everyone goes in as an O1 (2LT or Ensign) except in some instances for legal or medical positions.    I don't who makes a career of it more.  Each service has some tough issues to deal with (Navy- sea duty and the Army fighting two ongoing wars).    Rank likely comes pretty much the same for each on average.    I don't know what the heck WO learned in his 20+ years but 2 years of college is not enough!|`|XIJgbOotaa	okay here's your answer:    All military services require a 4 year bachelor degree from an accredited institution.     Now i should mention that the Navy cares a great deal more about major and GPA Its not an "eliteness" thing. As a naval officer, your in charge of ship operations and management. There you will be dealing with technical systems which means Engineering/Technical degrees with a decent GPA are a must. Army you don't need a strong science background to do your job so they just basically require the degree. Its the same with Marines and Airforce. Airforce wants tech degrees, Marines want more pure leadership.     Ranking is basically the same. Making careers is the same. I will say that it might be a tad harder to rank in the Navy (for example you basically NEED to have a sea command to progress past a certain rank). But all things considered they are about equal.

Me neither!|`|V74QiNi3aa	Simple answer.... Greed.  The Government wants everything everybody has, and people believe they need/want everthing everyone else has. this creates a bad circle     1) people take large risk to go into business. they sale their goods for a profit to someone.  They hire others to help (art of duplication) and pay them a fair wage. Governments taxes both heavy cause they want a part of the cash.  2) workers figures that the business owner make to much then goes on strike for a larger share of the profits.  This in turns lead to the owner asking more for the goods that are produced.  3) this in turns lead to the worker paying more for the finished goods and forces them to ask for higher wages.    Then it starts all over again and no one knows where it will ever end.

emNCaAq7aa	You would have to say what the illegal activity of the finding party was. In some cases they would have problems in others no.  Currently in the US police officers that obtain evidence illegally cannot use that evidence in court (exclusionary rule). That is likely to change with the current Supreme Court. If it does you will see more court cases suing officers for misconduct or court cases attempting to figure what kind of discipline should be used. In Britain were ther is no exclusionary rule the officer receives internal discipline if warranted, often it is a legitimate mistake, and the courts do not allow the stricken party to sue, since the wrongly obtained evidence is still evidence of wrong doing.|`|HH5mlAHhaa	If the evidence is obtained illegally, it becomes inadmissible in court.

These new limos get fewer than 10 mpg for you "green" folks out there.    8) He spent millions putting a basketball court into the White House.    9) Millions of his bailout money to Bank of America funded a large pre-Super Bowl party.    10) He nominated one of the most scandalous, unethical people on the planet to be Attorney General (Eric Holder). Holder pardoned a terrorist arms dealer in order to impress the dirt ball's defense attorney who was a close confidant of Al Gore in hopes that Holder would be nominated Attorney General if Al Gore won the Presidency after Clinton (Holder was deputy AG under Janet Reno). He also blatantly lied about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]). His ethical transgressions could fill a tome.    11) He nominated a bona fide member of the National Socialist Party of the U.S. to be in charge of the environment. Her name was quickly removed from the Socialist party web site shortly thereafter.    12) He's closing Gitmo while we're seeing former detainees back committing acts of terror against the U.S. and our allies. These 200+ current detainees will likely end up inside the borders of the U.S. as a result. Smart move.    13) We've seen the largest post-election stock market slump in recorded U.S. history.    14) Iran is mocking us as weak and negotiating with terrorists.    15) Russia, Venezuela, Cuba, and Iran are posturing since the election (passing Russian ships through the Panama canal, Russian meetings with Chavez, etc.).    16) Israel felt it necessary to abruptly invade Gaza and start a war to help themselves before Obama $&* s up our middle east policy by taking office.    In summation.....    In 2 weeks, we're viewed as weak internationally, the economy has plummeted faster than in any post-election period in recorded U.S. history, we're poised to double the deficit of Bush, and we've nominated and confirmed corrupt, tax-evading dirt balls to Obama's cabinet!

Unfortunately for Obama, he doesn't seem to recognize that the US and the rest of the world will need petroleum in the near and foreseeable future and his efforts to cut off domestic and offshore drilling will drive up prices, making petroleum exploration and production more expensive.  Obama probably doesn't intend to, but he is inadvertently creating a situation that will cause Halliburton to become more profitable.  The environmentalists and Democrats have no idea what they're doing.

This box has many advantages:  The TV has become an important source of information.  It is commonly used to inform and communicate both locally and abroad.  The TV has become a tool educate, entertain, and inform.  A broad spectrum of information can be found on TV; from health to the economy to general information.  The TV also keeps us informed about the current events happening in the world such as whether that be politics, sports, or economics.  The TV is also a way to entertain with music, movies and more.    However there are also disadvantages to the TV.  The media can be manipulative and doesn't facilitate critical thinking.  I can be destructive to social cohesion because of disputes over programs.  The TV brings about a familial experience.  TV has also affected people physically. Doctors assert that TV watching can cause eye strain and there is also the "couch potato lifestyle" causing a serious health hazard because of lack of exercise.  Some people have become overly dependent on TV; substituting it for other experiences in their life.  Finally, it has been argued that there is connection between TVs broadcast of violence and violence in real-life.    In conclusion, the progression of TV has made a world of information and entertainment available to everyone, however that advancement has had negative consequences to our health and society.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	The television was invented about thirty years.

On the telly, there are a lot of things that entertain as well; music, movies, (ames?) and others.    However, the telly also has many desadvantages.  The TV can manipulate the TV viewer. The media manipulates us because it ruins the critical mind.  The TV cause destruction of social cohesion (because any time people can dispute for the TV programmes?).  (It is bring about of familial life?).  Moreover, doctors assert that watching TV frequently, strains the eyes.  Some people become big from eating high calorie foods such as chocolate or crips in front of the TV.  Besides, some people become dependent and cannot do without TV.

3L6usp4haa	Now am not one to burst their bubble,but you know more than these do as the halftrack suspension was Kegresse Halftrack which was Citreon with a White hull M2|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Actually the export version, originally designed by the White Truck company (still in business) and later American Harvester (same) was the M5.  It had some changes to it's drivetrain, weapons mounts etc.  About 41,000 were built all told w/ approximately 15000 given to allies.  Postwar they were in combat use by Israel until 1980 or so.  BTW the Soviets (not "Russians" technically) had nothing but good things to say about US built halftrucks, trucks and  (US and Brit) aircraft.  They were less impressed by  US  (and especially Brit) AFVs-though the reliability of the M3 Sherman was noted. Even official Soviet histories mention this.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	We gave the Russians tons and tons of gear during WWII.  I suspect the M3 was not one of them.  Soviet gear had to be a lot tougher and easy to use than even our gear.
9tQSBMAQaa	Put down the phone, Lucy, and do your own homework.  First of all, you don't know the answers you are getting here are correct, and secondly, you aren't learning anything.|`|m1V5ws73aa	Asking others for the answers to your assignment is cheating.|`|fh12fkNWaa	Do your own homework from credible sources. This is not the place to get correct answers.
uh2bkRrFaa	You're either 5'4" or 5'5". You're not "like 5'4 or maybe 5'5 max..." It's not  gray area. You're one or the other and guessing the first if even that much.    I believe the minimum in most states is 5'6" but since you can't even tell the truth in yahoo answers, I'd say your options are nil.|`|IYu3bBFqaa	I think your literacy is more of a concern than your size at this point.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	Let's see if I have this correct.  You're either 5'4" or 5'5", your English and spelling is no very good and you don't really know how to express yourself.      I don't think you'll have to worry about getting past the literacy phase of testing.|`|emNCaAq7aa	They cannot discriminate on height. If they show actual cause, like you are to short to reach the pedals of a police car or if you do not fit in the standard height and weight charts set up by the feds (a lot of departments ignore those anyway)then they can eliminate you.  If general if you can pass all the tests they take you.  My department, a much bigger one than CHP, has effective officers who are only 5' tall.|`|rdSuD3qVaa	No, but I saw an altercation between a small framed officer and a taller guy who was upset because his son's motorbike, the kind with the lawnmower engines attached was being confiscated. The officer had his hands behind his back but the guy was leaning backwards and moving him all over the place. He had to call for backup. The guy went to jail but what a hassle. There are some limitations that just make sense. Last I heard they also had an age limit of 32 years old. Check out their website. The Ca CHP needs officers. Everyone speeds in Los Angeles.
HdSaN24caa	if you don't get caught, they'll .do  p.s. keep all parts separated when not in use.|`|IYu3bBFqaa	Stay in School and Away from guns!|`|LoSXjaGXaa	They're considered an AOW (I think, but are definitely an NFA item).  It's a $200 tax stamp, plus they have to be legal in your state. (at least in the first video)    I'm not sure about if it has a handle and a trigger.  That may fit the definition of a handgun.  Your best best would be to ask the BATF.|`|VDgLVHtGaa	If you're a cop you're above the law. So it's legal.|`|Gr99OjQuaa	ok.. i see that you have trouble spelling so im already frightened at the thought of you with a gun  secondly 'home made zip guns' - just sounds like a bad idea.   thirdly, how reliable of a source is youtube? i mean really?      my favorite is  "i deer hunt there it is my dads property so is the gun legal" a question/statement all in one.|`|yHwUbD6Saa	I already answered your questions.  IF (a big if) your state allows them, you have to register them with the federal gov't and contact the ATF, as well as your state attorney general, before even attempting such a creation.  The BATFE may be able to come to your home and inspect them at any time, as well.|`|ss393Fuiaa	No they are not legal.
AA10123414	Depends on a lot of things you decided not to share:  1. Did your kids go 50% of the time last week?  2. What does your agreement with them state?|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Unless you really need the money I'd pay them.    These are the people who take care of your kids, you should be on good terms with them. They have to pay their staff, even though the place was closed.    Now, if you missed work because of the storm, and didn't get paid, and this is a hardship, I'd talk to them about it.    If you want to be all legalistic, you need to check your contract with them...(I assume you have a contract).  That is what would govern in a court of law.    But real world... work something out. You want to be friends with these people.|`|8552a4e84a403e597110d3e39aa0659eaa	You should have a copy of your contract so re-read that. If there was no contract, then you may refuse to pay but they would also have the option to not have your child there.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	kinda depends on the terms you signed up to     when you enrolled your child at the daycare    plus, its not their fault the power went down,     as the staff  still have to be paid    Ask to see the Rules and Regulation policies|`|AA10599026	Check your contract with them, but if it doesn't say anything specific about you owing them whether they're open or not, then don't pay them. Let them try to sue you for it and have a judge laugh them out of court.|`|EnODJeIcaa	It depends on what type of contract you had with them. Those types of things are usually spelled out at the beginning of your childs term. Like when our son was in daycare (home now) if one of us called in sick on a given day and kept him home...We still had to pay for daycare on that day, but my wife worked for a school district so she got Christmas holiday and spring break off...She gave adequate notice and was not required to pay any day care, but if she had decided to not take him during that period without notice, based on our contract we would have been required to pay at least fifty percent of the cost...    If you have no agreement with them spelling this out you can fight them on it...at which point it isn't a good idea to leave your child with them anymore...or find somewhere else for him or her to go...if they had something in their handouts spelling this out then you'll likely have to pay.    But fighting with the people who are taking care of your child all day is never really a good idea.    Your sort of over a barrel on this one, unless you choose to stay home with your kid or find someone new.
AubmEoYgaa	Call your County Health Dept. or the E.P.A. Mold is usually greenish looking. May be something else. But call the Health Officials and lay it in their lap. If they don't respond, then call the E.P.A. and be sure to report the Health Dept. for not responding. Wishing you the very best Bri V and good luck.|`|57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	Look in the yellow pages for a mold tester|`|tAMkjOjSaa	go to the health department   they will get action....mold can be a very serious health hazard|`|LnHOn5JOaa	Mold can be very dangerous. They didn't clean it with bleach before they painted?? I would call your town hall and find out what you can do about your building owner. You can also rent an ozone machine to kill the mold. You do have to make sure everyone and every animal is out of the house before you use it though. But it does kill the mold. Especially since there is probably more then you can see.
8ZN38eapaa	what are you talking about, did you just wake up from a coma!?!?!?|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Yes....Good luck with that...|`|MEReSvZeaa	Nothing says "government waste" like $819 billion "emergency bill" that everyone in the US is still trying to figure out.    It's very difficult to get a clear answer on how any of it actually stimulates the economy, the supposed nature of the emergency.|`|4zijn0cgaa	ANOTHER it`s Bush`s fault question?|`|SsB7aRExaa	You really should have some basic knowledge of recent events before you talk about them.  Waste and fraud were frequently reported during Bush's administration.    Well, mostly Republican waste and fraud.  Democrat waste and fraud was, as usual, quickly swept under the rug.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	there was none|`|LZLQKUMPaa	maybe it wasn't that bad,compare to what the democrats are doing .|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Hussein Obama voted for the Patriot act! Check it out!|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Democrats don't care enough about money and being frugal to pay close enough attention to catch it.  Republicans only demand fiscal responsibility from Democrats.  Apparently, it's okay for other Republicans to balloon our National Debt with lots of pork spending.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Bureaucratic reporting is interminable, but it was evident that the Karzai (U.S.-supported government) has been corrupt from its inception.  After the billions/trillions wasted in Iraq, there should be no shock that the former U.S. president's policies have been mismanaged and shameful.   Bush's incompetent legacy will be long-lasting and painful.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Because it came from the Democrat Congress.    Obama is the Messiah.   Bow Down and get used to it.|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	I wuz glad u pointing that out. most of all the educated folks was voting for obama becuz of the biast media always wuz talking up bush.

You mean like spending $150 for an inaguratoin ceremony?  I don't care who is in office, don't raise my taxes when you can't manage the money you already get!|`|Q9W7p6Kzaa	Obama will wind up prosecuting or allowing the UN to prosecute for war crimes. Count on it.|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	They did all the time.  The mainstream media only pays attention to it when Democrats "discover" waste and fraud.    No, Obama understands that "warrantless wiretapping" is necessary.  That's why he voted for FISA.  He didn't want to be on the wrong side of the issue.  These are not "warrantless" BTW.  The warrants must be obtained after the fact before they can be used in court.  So they are in effect in compliance with the Constitution.  Furthermore, your sorry @ss hasn't been blown to pieces in the past 7 years, has it?  Neither has any other American's.

KYqQxmXuaa	Yes, I agree the EU is wing of the NewWorldOrder plan for global domination by the Rothschilds  etc.   The immigration policy is designed to destroy the member nations national and social cohesion so they will be too weakened to resist global dictatorship.   Unfortunately the Rothschilds control the IMF too and when Iceland went bankrupt the IMF dictate.     let's hope Iceland holds out and isn't bullied, blackmailed and bribed by the Satanic banksters who are their final push for world domination.      PrimozP: think again, The EU has the same plans for everywhere. You will see.    eorpach: are you actually trying to claim that Ireland hasn't experienced extraordinary rates of immigration over the past decade? If you are then you are very mistaken or else you are too ideologically indoctrinated to see the reality.    In fact the Icelanders would do well to see Ireland as an reason to stay out of the CFR/Freemasonic  controlled EUSSR.|`|AA11313983	The Iceland we know today went bankrupt a couple of months ago.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	I hope not for their sake.

The influx of mass immigration for Sweden was its own governments decision, not that of the EU which has very little control over immigration and asylum laws.|`|AA11622346	Oh no Iceland! Ain't y'all havin a problem with polish immigration at the moment? well not to mention the lack of an economy and government... but hey Im sure the world's strongest man can fight off all the terrorists. best of luck lol.|`|zrR7KXCnaa	Are you a troll or just a nazi??  No Iceland will not be flooded by immigrants especially after the credit crunch. Well maybe we'll come to Iceland to have a really cheap vacations and buy our selves something for only few euro cents :D  I think that Iceland would only benefit from joining the EU. Especially after it would accept the  (Euro) as that would prevent from further deflation / inflation and such.    But I must to some extent agree that after Romania and Bulgaria became members of EU many beggars "imported" from these two countries  appear on our streets. But unfortunately for them we Slovenes are very cynical about these stuff and they gave up after few months. I guess that they will give up even faster in Iceland due to cold weather :D|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Its too bad they cant just be themselves up there.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	No.  1- PPD Secret Service Agents are HEAVILY screened as are their families.  This is after the extensive screening they already went through to become Treasury Agents.  Also passengers are not allowed in all spaces on the jet-preventing the terrorists in the movie from securing the entire jet.  The AF security guys, plus other SS guys would've engaged the terrorists.  2- The VC25 has no ramp, no parachutes, no "escape pod"  3- The VC25 DOES have countermeasures and extensive comms  4- "Foreign" reporters are normally NOT allowed on board.  Screening issues.  5- The VC25 IS technically air-refuelable, though none of the crews are qualified-too nasty for the passengers.  6- There are no fighters stationed at Ramstein, haven't been since before the Gulf War.  7- The issue with other fighters intercepting isn't plausible, as AWACS coverage of the entire President's route of flight is a priority.  They would've been detected and interceptors vectored (and the VC25 vectored away) to/from the bandits.  That's about all I can mention in this forum.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	Which happenings?

emNCaAq7aa	Unlike the people in cop shows real cops that do not have a rifle that is sited for them and who do not get to practice every other day (like SWAT snipers) know that they can't hit what they are pointing at most of the time, especially with a hand gun and when under a huge amount of stress. That is why cops don't "shoot to maim" but go for center mass, the largest target.  So first off the hostage officer is not going to say anything like that unless he is trying to distract the bad guy for an attempt escape. The partner is likely not going to shoot unless he too watches a lot of TV.  As far a discipline goes most departments have rules saying that you cannot endanger another in trying to take out the bad guy. They could, but likely would not, discipline the shooting officer since that officer has enough problems as it is.  I worked in a large city in the Midwest, we use the term "offender". If an officer reported to me (I was a sergeant) that the "perps" did something I knew that officer was a recruit and watched to much TV and needed some real life training.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	You're watching way to much TV apparently.  The Officer could get in trouble if the prosecutor decided to prosecute it.  The Officer would probably have some psychological problems after shooting his friend.  There is a drill we (my squad) train on for these situations.  I'm not going to say what it is because I'm not going to give up a tactic.  However, it is better to have a plan and be trained up on it.|`|f5DQLq3Laa	Unlike the people in cop shows real cops that do not have a rifle that is sited for them and who do not get to practice every other day (like SWAT snipers) know that they can't hit what they are pointing at most of the time, especially with a hand gun and when under a huge amount of stress.

This will ultimately cause a lot more racial tension. People need to feel like they belong somewhere and the EU will ultimately lead to mass persecution and resentment. This absurd notion of everyone living together in harmony holding hands and singing songs is total nonsense. We must accept that we have differences and sometimes these differences cause conflict. The EU will break down like the soveit union and the ethnic bloodshed that was a result of economic immigration will be much the same.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	I think they are trying to turn us all into Gypsies.

Less well developed country's like Roumania have a lot of unemployed people willing to up-sticks and go off to low paid jobs abroad while, for e.g. uk resident working classes can't be so flexible as they have very expensive mortgages, high taxation and no incentives to work in a lower paid country.   We have huge bills to pay and only 1 way to pay them, work.     If i was to leave the uk, i would have to be able to find reliable work with a long term future in a well paid job.   Im sorry, but i for one cant think of more than 3 countries where the standard of living is high enough to entice me from my own country, where the pay outstrips the uk by a large enough margin that i would be able to send money home (like so may migrants do in the uk- money that is then out of taxable circulation and therefore contributing nothing to the overall uk economy) to pay my mortgage and still live a comfortable life Style before returning home to my family. the 3 country's are Germany, France, and norway. 2 of those 3 wanted unrestricted working for labour forces across europe, pushed their ideas through the E.U parliament then closed there borders to migrant workers.

Ot7PJrddaa	He just has to get a conditional release from the guard to go into the regular Air Force.  have him talk to an Air Force recruiter and they can help him through the process.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Sort of,    The Air Force will allow Air Force prior service in the following AFSC's to enlist or come back on active duty.    Airborne Crypto linguist  CCT  Para Rescue  SERE  TACP  EOD  Security Forces Military working dog  Surgical services orthopedics  Aerospace med service.    The Air Force also allowed 20 prior service from any branch to enlist for the following AFSC's:    CCT, Para Rescue, SERE, EOD, TACP    Those 20 slots were filled by December 2008, no new slots will open until Oct 2009.      Air Force National Guardsmen and Air Force reservist are considered prior service.    So unless your husband has one of the first 9 AFSC's, he will NOT be allowed to enlist into active duty Air Force.    And after OCT 2009, he would have to enlist as one of the last 4 AFSC's to be allowed o active duty.|`|6lk6TYohaa	I know it could be done in the Army 3 to 6 months I think|`|XpaLyWYOaa	You can probably call a recruiter right now or go onto the Air National Guard (http://www.goang.com/) or Air Force (http://www.airforce.com/) websites and do a live chat and ask. But my guess is that it might be a little more difficult to make the switch just because the Air Force actually is needing to downsize. And in any of the services you just have to talk to recruiters and find openings in active duty since it is a jump from part-time to full-time. But a recruiter will know exactly how to answer your question since they'll have specific information at their fingertips. Hope this helps.|`|AA10894601	I was in the TN Air National Guard for a year and half.  I got out because my husband got orders to Okinawa, Japan and I did not want to go two years without him. I tried to switch to Active Duty but they only allow a select few AFSC's to make that transition.  To me, this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard because you think that they would want someone who has already been through the training so they wouldn't have to pay to send someone else.  I talked to recruiter and asked if I could cross-train into one of the open jobs and they told me no.    Have him check with a local Active Duty recruiter to see what jobs are currently open. I was told that "they change from day to day" which is not really true, but it couldn't hurt to check back regularly.    Good luck, I hope that everything goes his way. I ended up just getting out completely (on a lucky loophole that still gave me an honorable discharge!) but I doubt that he has that option, nor would he probably want to do it.

He brought to the nations attention "The Emperor had no Clothes". So they tried to crush him.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Because Joe the Plumber  was apparently so concerned about possible higher taxes under Obama that he didn't pay them under Bush. He is a lying fraud.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	It's because he was a conservative poster boy.|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	I'm guessing because the $1,000 he owed was such a large percentage of his income and net worth, unlike the $128,000 owed in the recent case (it is probably a very small percentage of Daschle's income and net worth, so small, it was just an oversight, an honest mistake).|`|q4EXFhV7aa	It was important because Joe stated that he didn't want to have to use his taxes to help others in need. Joe didn't pay his taxes, thus the importance. Let's not pretend that Republicans have never made an error in their taxes.|`|rttm1SLaaa	...They're all being looked at very closely. Note how so much media attention is being focused on Daschle now that we've found out about his tax issues.  Guess what?  There's nothing special about who it is.  The media latches onto any story that catches the public eye, and this seems to be a hot button issue.|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Joe made the Messiah look bad.

Get over it.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	They are both important, otherwise we wouldn't know about them. Joe the Plumber's taxes were brought up specifically because of the irony involved. He was a man who is famous for whining about taxes when he hasn't even paid his taxes and the candidate he was whining about would actually lower his taxes.    Of course Geithner missing taxes is also ironic considering he is the treasury secretary, although at least he finally paid the taxes that he owed. There isn't anything ironic about Daschle's tax problems, but it is still being reported anyway. So what makes you think they are somehow not important to the media?|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	It wasn't a big story, and it wouldn't have been a story at all but for his complaints about paying taxes when he already showed that he didn't pay taxes  and didn't pay them even up to the time a court put a lien against him, which hasn't had to happen with any of the disputes we have seen with Daschel or Geithner,  the paid up, all that was due, without going to court.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	They had to destroy anyone who questioned the token ne*gro.

EnODJeIcaa	Seems so...Bush was a phoney conservative who bolstered the size of government in unbelievable ways...besides the war...he was a liberals best friend....and liberals love the idea of a massive FEDZILLA with an insatiable desire for dollars...shoveling them into a furnace called "bureaucracy" that spits out poor menial results for the costs...The democrats run California but the so called Republican Govenor was at the sterring wheel with his democrat controlled congress cheering him on as he spent California into oblivion.    Seems like a perfect recipe for disaster...A bunch of spend happy democrats in a congress and a liberal in conservative clothing at the helm. Spending us into total bankruptcy while producing little if any positive results from the trillions of dollars that are supposed to fix everything.    I run a business and there are times (although not often) when throwing money at a problem will fix it...but more often than not...the policy itself is what is flawed...Sarbanes Oxley is an example of this...Liberals have tons and tons of good intentions as do conservatives, but the proof is in the pudding, and after a couple of decades of watching the whole mess that goes on in Washington it seems like if they really want to mess something up it usually happens when they step in to try to fix it, or regulate it, or solve it.    They should just stick to keeping us safe, building roads, building bridges, building infrastructure, keeping cops on the street, and leave the rest to us...competition breeds results...There is no competition in government run programs so a poorly run ship can keep running forever...Where a private company must make changes for it to be succesful or fail.

The things you mentioned are in the "stimulus bill".  Sure roads and train tracks could use improvement but that is not going to provide very many jobs.  The electrical grid could probably use some improvement but again very,very few jobs.  This proposal is supposed to stimulate the economy and provide jobs.  It does neither.  This is why the republicans in the house (as well as 11 democrats) voted against this bill.  The republicans wanted more money for companies in the form of tax credits for hiring people.  (more jobs)  They wanted to lower taxes across the board so that we the people could keep more of what we earn.  You do know that if you get more money you tend to spend more money, don't you.  The more you spend the more you stimulate job growth, the more people working the more money being spent.

And to Liberal Asskicker: I fail to see your point. You say creating jobs helps the economy because those people spend THEIR money on consumer goods, correct? Do you think rebuilding roads is going to happen magically? No, the government is going to hire contractors for different companies, thus creating jobs/job opportunities to people who are unemployed.

I think somewhere on page 312 there's something about increasing EITC which is a giveaway to illegal aliens.

A stimulus package doesn't have projects in it that don't start till 2010 and 2011. Stimulus packages start immediately.  Second. If you have a given pool of suppliers that bid on contracts to provide supplies to construction projects. Then, that pool is decreased from, say, six to one, due to the "buy american" clause. The remaining supplier, the american, can increase the purchase price of his product. This increase in supply cost will result in an increase in project cost. This project increase will result in either a drop in the amount of projects that can be completed or a cost over run that will result in another "stimulus package".  That would be bad.|`|i7oHTo9haa	because it excludes our allies.

In the last 15 years imports have roase 1500% while exports dropped 1100%.The credit debt of Americans has increased along the same lines as there are fewer dollars from GDP going to workers. This meant consumption went up and industry went down. This could be compared to a poor man with baloon loan except it was the retail buisness buying jets and outsourcing customers at the same time.    When you send more then half of your growth to another country it baloons faster then a bad loan. When it fills to much with inflation and credit debt it pops. Then you have no industry, the retailer have a smaller cutomer base, and the banks have more debt then equity.    The only solution that works is to rebuild what every enemy in the world fears American industry and are workers so much better that when even threaten it the crooks around the world scream in fear.     We need to tax non American made goods in stores to make the consumer not want to buy them.

Basically we fell into our own trap...|`|G2auAv1Saa	His reasoning for it: "I don't think we ought to use a measure that is supposed to be timely, temporary, and targeted to set off trade wars when the entire world is experiencing a downturn in the economy," said Senator Mitch McConnell.    American products cost way more and take much longer to produce. This will also hurt the rest of the worlds economies and for a country who mainly relies on imports it is not smart to hurt them because they have more power to hurt us. This can cause a trade war.   There are also ports, railways and airways that would be greatly effected by this.|`|BJhOd2usaa	Bizarre, isn't it? why should we stimulate China's economy?

We have trade agreements with Canada and I think they'll be upset with us if we stop buing their steel.  Even though there is a clause in the stimulus that says that if the American steel requirement raises the cost of steel for a project by more than 25% that the requirement can be ignored, it could still raise costs for the companies doing work under the stimulus, and republicans really hate when you raise the cost of doing business.      I like the clause, because it ensures that in addition to putting construction workers to work, that we will be putting steel workers to work, and getting more job-creating bang for our buck from the stimulus.  But if we agreed that we wouldn't tax Canadian steel and pass this kind of law, we are breaking the spirit of that agreement, even if it isn't actually an import tax.|`|vpEDVEiKaa	We wouldn't have to dictate it, if there was actually industry worthy of production here!

g2R7e2eVaa	It is because of idiots like McConnell that I am moving away from the Republican Party all together. Im just going to go independant from now on.     He wants to remove the stipulation that requires the US to purchase its steel and iron from US companies. What kind of BS is this? Foreigners dont have enough of our money i guess. I guess Oil and natural gas is not enough to make the US bend over and take it up the yang, now he wants to add iron and steel to the list.    Gee, now we can go and invade south africa because we have an interest there too!    Friggin Loser!      Wait, Im not done! The country we start buying Iron and Steel from will end up with an anti-American dictator like Chavez or Castro, or it will end up establishing an anti-American coalition like OPEC to control Iron and Steel.   They will find some reason to get angry with us and skyrocket the price just like the saudis did with oil. Then we will end up paying for a car what we would for a house.     I swear this is all a ploy to get the American people to stop driving cars. Run the price of fuel through the roof then attack the price of the cars themselves.     I could really see gas being 5 bucks a gallon and a cheap piece of crap, base model car going for 60 grand if this happens.|`|bhOn6uWQaa	The money should not be printed at all.|`|6nS62bB8aa	I say Buy American.    The amount of raw materials, like steele and aluminum, that America uses within our own borders is really a small amount of our GDP.

Or at least I hope you do.|`|Oh9oFiriaa	i say keep it here|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Considering that we are trying to stimulate the United States economy I would say the logical answer is yes, it should stay over here.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Protectionism was a major contributor to the Great Depression, so no, I don't think there should be a "Buy American" clause.
5ac2dCxJaa	Any time a politician who is outside of the business political system and starts talking about the issues that really matter to Americans, they get marginalized and diminished in the media.    Why did we not hear one mention in the presidential debates about, education, The Federal Reserve, The Military Industrial Complex, monetary policy, national debt.     These are the big issues that are off limits to any social discourse.    I mean seriously look at these comments. Saying that a guy who is a Medical doctor and has a Doctorate in economics who is a military veteran and a long standing Congressman, a nut, misguided, racist. Seriously where do people get the negative from? The media. This guy has the best resume in the country but he's a nut. Seriously. Obama is a lawyer, community organizer but Ron Paul is a nut?|`|CpTQagJOaa	I like Ron Paul. I voted McCain, but only because I knew Ron Paul would not have a fair chance. I wish he was given more of a chance...but I'm Independent, not Republican.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Ron Paul has some great ideas, he just gets too nutty about things and unable to carry it forward.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	It's not just Republicans.  Plenty of Democrats dislike him him as well.    He's a racist (look up his published comments about blacks being 'fleet footed') with unrealistic ideas of how to run a nation.  Banking the economy on gold?  C'mon.  The man is insane.|`|58EydBwwaa	Anyone with a scrap of brain in their head (Democrat, Republican, or Independent) knows that Ron Paul is the only politician in this country who shouldn't be taken out behind the barn and put out of his misery. He is the definition of a patriot, and the only person in Congress who hasn't forgotten the document upon which this country was founded.|`|0pPT2HqKaa	Republicans HATE logic and reasoning therefore Ron Paul is like another liberal. More proof that real conservatism and Republicanism are two different things.|`|5ZfcMc34aa	Ron Paul supporters are not invested in the real world, they view the political scene as hypothetical.    My guess is they are mostly students and conservative hippies.    Ron Paul's ideals would require a revolution...not a hypothetical revolution...a real one where all of the rules would change, plans would be disrupted, fortunes lost, thousands of military and government workers unemployed, states feuding among themselves, wealth belonging exclusively to the wealthy, and an unprecedented rise in desperate property crime.|`|hZJ6xx1Kaa	Splitter!|`|mPLXUorTaa	I'm a Democrat, and I think Ron Paul supporters are somewhat like a cult.  I hear a lot of talk about how Ron Paul is America's only hope and salvation. His followers seem very devout, as if he were a religious leader.  It just seems a bit strange to me.|`|1laN1zSAaa	I agree with Ron Paul on many issues.I don't know why some republicans don't like him or his supporters.|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	I'm a Republican and a big time supporter of Dr. Ron Paul.  It's the Democrats who are so vehemently opposed to him.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	A "cult" is what any group will be referred to when it is attempted to be marginalized.  Democrats called McCain's supporters a "cult" during the election, Republicans called Obama's supporters a "cult" during the election.  It's an insult thrown with the intention of casting a negative light.  Saying it about Ron Paul's supporters is no different, a meaningless blanket statement.    Now, many Republicans don't like him because Ron Paul called the neocons out on all the key issues they are wrong about.    Many Democrats don't like him because he wants to cut down on the welfare state and social programs, significantly.    In general, people are used to how big the government is, coupled with the fact that few have actually read the Constitution and have an idea of how big the government is supposed to be.  On the other hand, Ron Paul knows the constitution like the back of his hand, as well as American history.  Therefore, I'm willing to take his word over a bunch of morons who have never read our founding document and "make their case" that he "wacky" without any objective, factual merit.    He knows what he's talking about.  A lot of the stuff he says does seem "out there" at first glance, but you have to research into what he's saying;  that means going beyond watching what he says on the news programs.  Reading his writings on the internet that explain his position, in full, makes his positions a lot more sensible than going on ONLY what you hear him say during a 3-5 minute interview with a pundit.    Which leads me to my last point;  many people favor their ideologic and party loyalty over real change.  They would rather cheerlead for their team than to use sound judgement.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Ron Paul is a member of the old guard of republicans, see Taft and Goldwater.  Ron Paul held a stark minority stand on the Iraq War, and many republicans disagree with this.  Ron has a fierce libertarian streak and is more aligned with Libertarian principles than with current republican principles.  Ron Paul refused to bow out of the raise and endorse McCain.  This is standard procedure in presidential races, for those who are after a couple primaries are not in great standing to bow out and endorse a stronger contender.     Ron did not win because he did a horrible job marketing himself.  He did not stress his friendship with Ronald Reagan, His plans for defeating Al Qaeda in Pakistan and how he would be able to beat Barack Obama. Had he concentrated more on these points when he was allowed to speak in the debates, than on Iraq, he would have done much better.      A small, but extremely vocal group of Ron Paul supporters were cult like, but then so were a large group of Obama's supporters.  I do not like to hear chanting of any politicians name.|`|BRwPEuzAaa	I beg to disagree. I am a Republican and a supporter of Ron Paul, the only man in Congress who has the slightest inkling of what is going on. He sits on the Financial committees, questions Paulson on all his moves- If anyone has watched the CNN taped segments of how he drills the Feds you'd walk away feeling safer that someone is putting these crooks feet to the fire. It's not his fault that the media chooses very carefully what to feed the hypnotized population of the U.S. who cannot think for themselves and wait until Oprah, or Anderson Cooper tells them what to do.|`|ggBfHk1waa	They find the Constitution a nuisance, a burden to overcome rather than a guide on how to run our country.  Democrats are no better.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I would've voted for him if he'd had any real chance in the election.|`|AA11702773	He would absolutely do away with special interest influence.  Many LIKE special interest influence, if they have special interests.  Others listen to people who have special interests.    That's my take on it.    Of course there are those who are just partisan to someone else and don't want ANYone disagreeing with their candidate.  Particularly anyone who will make their candidate look like a dribbling idiot in a debate.  --  and Law and Order, you are simply a liar.  He never wrote that.  In 20 years of office he has never done a single racist thing, and has done many things that disproportionately benefit minorities.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	He's somewhat misguided.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	By-in-large its easier to attack something or someone, than to propose a better idea, or any idea, yourself.    And until recently the GOP were the Kings of mud slinging|`|t3QAaSN9aa	I think some of them are still upset that Ron Paul criticized the Iraq War in very strong terms and they don't like dissent and they haven't forgiven him.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Its a damn shame isnt it? Too bad hes the only patriot left on either side of the government. Its ok Ronny has got my support until the end of time!|`|AA10329269	Really? I thought he garnered support from both Republicans and Democrats? I knew many Republicans that supported him.    But some of his followers did act like they were in a cult....they were quite obsessive! His ideas also made him appealing to the tin-foil hat crowd.

The reporters need to hound the Press Secretary, until they receive a satisfactory answer to the question.  At each Presidential Press Conference, Obama's Press Secretary will lead the reporters off on some tangent, almost every time they ask a question that the Press Secretary doesn't want to answer.  The media should step up to the plate and ask the questions that need to be answered. And get over the timidity and fear of being afraid of loosing the White House beat.  Other times I have seen the Press Secretary ignore several people who have their hands raised to ask a question, and pick someone they know will not ask tough questions.  This is the reporter who asks the color of the tie that Obama wore that day.  Daschle is the third person nominated by Obama that has had problems with not paying their taxes, and Obama expects the american public to accept this and allow these people to be our representatives.  They can't expect the American citizens at large to keep on supporting the POTUS, when he is making decisions to fill his cabinet with people who can't be trusted to file their own taxes, and then tried to cheat the IRS to get more money back on their returns or lowering the amount that they the IRS.  Somehow, Obama is going to have to be told that he needs to dump these people and move onto someone who is honest, which is a hard thing to do in politics, especially when trying to fill cabinet posts that are essential to not only the operation of the Government on a day to day basis.  In many cases these individuals are required to handle not only top secret documents, but also money.
Ot7PJrddaa	1.  No - this country lacks the will to have people serve.    2.  No - women have never been drafted and our culture won't allow for it.    Just my opinion.|`|AA10025824	No, we'll never have a draft again.    And yes, it we did women would be eligible.|`|DgLBtjWoaa	First, no. Drafting people is a big mistake. Forcing people who don't believe in the cause to serve in the military is dangerous. I think it would take another war of epic proportions or some kind of dire threat to the American way of life, like an invasion of our homeland. I don't wanna share a foxhole with someone who doesn't wanna be there.    Second, yes. Women now play an integral role in our military. They are vital to the fight and can do almost any job men can do. Wars would be that much harder to win without them.|`|AA10079277	No, because the military does not want a draft.  They don't want people in their ranks who do not want to be there.|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	I am not a Democrat and they are the ones who keep bringing it up.      I say draft women and put them in combat just like the guys.|`|AA11401709	I don't think there will be a draft. I mean what's more critical than having 2 wars at the same time? If a draft happens, you will find more people in the streets begging for food. Remember what happened after Vietnam?
eSGuZ5MFaa	nobody with a brain and a ounce of dignity would  endorse this spending spree..government doesn't need to spend  right  now  they need to conserve because they have less money coming in..|`|E9XL5x3Paa	The point of the stimulus is not spending.    You guys really should learn to start reading between the lines. Obama is actually working for what Republicans want, but in a way that actually works.    Obama knows that kind of spending would never be approved, but then its not supposed to be approved. The idea is to increase confidence in us.      Look, Democrats are supposed to initiate this by bringing the bill forward, making them look good when they see that the situation is dire enough to require action. That increases their support among their constituents.    Then the Republicans are supposed to take away that pork you are complaining about, when they object to the spending. That makes them look good when it shows them as being financially restrained again, bringing their constituents back behind them.    Then they get the new bill, free of the pork, before Congress again. They vote, with a huge majority from both sides. Then we gain confidence in the government and in the economy when we see them working together. That we know they play games with each other, but that they know when to stop playing games and can get serious about really working together when the situation calls for it. They work together, and then we gain that confidence.    And even before any spending is done, our confidence level moves up and that convinces customers to start buying again, investors to start investing again, and businesses to start hiring again. Without any spending, and moving toward a private sector solution (restoring confidence so we do this ourselves), the whole thing is saved.          Only problem is, Republicans are not playing their part. Now a huge part of that is Nancy Pelosi, who got screwed when Republicans were in charge and now intends to return in kind. But Republicans are not helping anything when they throw their little temper tantrum about Pelosi and then refuse to do anything but complain.    It also isn't helping that Republicans are trying to ADD spending to the bill. That wasn't what Obama was wanting them to do nor expecting them to do, and that definitely shouldn't be what they are doing.    Notice that when they complain about too much spending, Obama takes that part OUT of the bill. But when Republicans try to add to the bill, he steps in the way. To anyone paying attention, you can see what Obama is trying to do. He needs Republican voters on board with this so they can get some confidence, too. They are customers, business owners, and investors just like Democrats. We need everyone gaining confidence, but it doesn't work if Republican Senators and Congressmen don't play their part.    They have to start cutting out the pork, as was their role when this plan began. But they keep wanting to add to the pork instead, replacing the current pork with pork of their own. That isn't what Obama wants, and sure as h*ll not what we need.    Republicans need to do what they have said they would do, which is CUT the pork, not replace it with more of their own. Nancy Pelosi needs to get over herself.     This plan can work, Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans just need to pull their sh*t together. And Republicans need to start acting like actual Conservatives, and start cutting instead of adding.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	It also includes $275 billion in tax cuts.    As Milton Friedman, conservative, Nobel-Prize-winning economist said: "We are all Keynesians now." (meaning, "we need to spend a sh*tload of money now!")|`|tuChBv6Eaa	if we don't spent money how where going to get out of this mess??    tax cuts??|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	I do. I believe the money put towards education & health care will not only create immediate jobs, but pay dividends for years to come. I also believe the portion of the plan dealing with tax cuts are broad and effective. My criticism is that the bill should really be in 2 parts - immediate job creation & long term job creation. Having one huge plan is harder to pass and more prone to criticism.

The term "Rush Limbaugh" has become a symbolic way of referring to uneducated Republican buffoonery in general.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Obama was talking about listening to Rush in the sense that you listen to a news program.  Its not a place to take information from, even Rush admits its an entertainment program.  He gives his opinions in a very entertaining way, but don't listen to him like you would listen to your mother.  If you listen to your mother that is.  As far as listening to his program, that is fine, Obama wasn't suggesting he be banned.  Rush truly isn't that important.  During Roosevelt's administration the press could get pretty unruly. Radio was big back then, since then, the growth of the political talk radio has been fairly recent so you can't go by that.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	Yes, several Presidents going back to Roosevelt have addressed members of the media they don't like.|`|eSGuZ5MFaa	obama fears rush because he knows rush has a lot of people  behind him that are smart and powerful ..

I was interested in catching the Air America programming on the radio, but I couldn't find it on any of my local stations.  I think they just pulled the plug on it too soon.

Rush Limbaugh came up in Radio, and he's been through the competition and perfected his show over decades.

Left wing talk radio is basically right wing talk radio but with a different viewpoint, and I don't think the tactic of simply launching into long polemics against the opposition sits well with most liberal radio listeners who've long been accustomed to the NPR style.    Liberals may not have made as effective use of radio as conservatives, but they have thus far shown to be more effective on the internet.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	Air America is reasonably successful, but I think the simple reason is that most liberals prefer a thoughtful NPR segment to the propaganda that is political radio.|`|zftm6qkKaa	Air America now has a Senator in office.

5ZkGgZWSaa	Xenophobes are people who dont  like foreigners or people who are from 'outside', just ignore them they cannot comprehend that for some this country could be the difference between life & death. I employed a lady who came here after her daughter & husband were hacked to death in front of her. This was the only place she could come to escape with her life.  We have had immigrants for thousands of years(not that your one Angel!) & without them we would probably not be in the position we are today as a nation & enjoying the comparative riches in health & access to luxury goods etc.       Obviously some dont bother reading, i can see you have been an expat for 2 years. Anyway ignore all the 'dont come here' etc etc.  Anyway, you should be entitled to housing benefit & depending on if you pay the council tax seperately you'll get council tax benefit too. Also you should be entitled to child tax credit & when ur husband starts working (for more than 16 hours) you may be entitled to working tax credit. You keep the child tax credit no matter what.  Whilst ur husband is not working he will have to go onto Jobseekers allowance & any difference between that and the minimum the law says you have to live off will be made up with income support (or child tax credit depends on which way you want to go, generally you wont get CTC & income support sat the same time)  Even when ur husband starts work you should get a 'run on' of the benefits for a couple of weeks afterwards.  See the link for more info on what you can claim & how to claim it.  WELCOME BACK TO A SNOWY BLIGHTY!!  What some think they shouldn't get what they are entitled to? They are brits coming back to & hubby getting a job, your're such xenaphobes :-(|`|nW3iJkT5aa	We prefer people who say "what can I offer"  rather than" what can I get"|`|Oh9oFiriaa	try getting a job|`|BNAzjSO1aa	You will need to contact the benefit office where you will be moving to as the entitlement to benefits can be a minefield|`|EnODJeIcaa	Your the problem...what are you "ENTITLED" to?

However, you may have wound people up by asking "what do I get for a second child?". Or, indeed, by asking if you lose your benefit by working 16 hours; this implies you're able to work, but will refuse to do so if you can sponge an easier life from the rest of us.    It seems that you can't afford a second child. So don't have one. Your children are *your* responsibility, not ours. You pay for them - I have my own to feed, thanks.     As for your statement  that you have a job as a mother - well, that's dandy. But I didn't employ you, so why should I pay you? Someone obviously did, as you got up the duff - get them to pay instead.    I couldn't care less if you're from the UK or not, and I'm not overwhelmed by your sense of entitlement. If you can't afford a kid, don't breed - it's a simple equation.        I will leave you with this little quote - can't remember who it's from...    "For every person who receives without working, there is someone who has worked without receiving."      Other than that - welcome home.      EDIT: Fine. But hwy not ask 'what temproary work is available for two months, until my husband starts work?'. It sounds a lot better than - 'What can I claim?'.    As for your assertion that you're not taking food from my kid's mouth - where do you think benefit comes from? The magic money fairy in the sky?     If you can work 16 hours, or whatever, work it without complaining. Work it without basing your decision on whether it costs you ten pounds a week in benefit. At least you can hold your head high, know you've done your best, and take the benefit money with some degree of dignity.    I'm not against benefits. I approve of benefits for people in need. But the ones who simply don't try wind me up royally, and the way you have phrased your question enters you into this category.|`|6nS62bB8aa	Glad that you are moving to the U.K.    If you were moving here to America, you would be entitled to say that you are moving to America.

No offence but the UK have more then enough people living over here who live of the benefits system..    If you are Ex pats, then set a better example.    ** use your head, your question with out all the extra added lines reads like a statment form a person wanting to take everything and give nothing back. I wont apologise that i find that a little bit too much. Having said that , I wish you luck in your homecoming, perhaps if you had phrased your question better you would not have got such a negative or indifferent response....    And as for getting out of my tree, monkeys dont require benefit.
Fyq5nK4waa	Did Daschle make an error or was he evading taxes?  Since we will never know, we need to focus on the source of the problem, taxes.  If the Fair Tax was in place, yes, Daschle would not of made this mistake.  If the Fair Tax was in place, there would be no excuses for mistakes since everyone's tax responsibility would be a flat percent on all retail spending.      How many mistakes are done every year.  How many people miss paying taxes or over pay taxes?  How many miss deductions and take too many deductions?      Not only would the Fair Tax not penelize honest people from making errors, it would stimulate the economy better than anything currently being talked about.      If the Government would start today with a Fair Tax, stop all other taxes, they would save over $500 Billion a year.  This savings would not take any money from the Government as this amount comes from the cost of trying to figure out a crazy tax system.      The cost for everyone to figure out their taxes is over $200 Billion.  This does not include the cost to Business and Not for Profits that must track every dollar spent, and base every decision on how the tax laws will affect them.  By allowing Business to not worry about taxes , they can grow and create jobs. For people who believe these Corporations need a spanking by taxing them are fooling themselves.  In most cases, these corporate taxes are added to the product and we, the poor end consumer are actually paying these corporate taxes.      Yes, the Government can save $500 Billion dollars over the next 12 months, no give backs, no gimicks, the savings comes from eliminating the biggest problem facing America.  People like Daschle would not be violating the law.  If Daschle will support the Fair Tax, I'll give him the break.  If not, he's a criminal.|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	I want no part of a democrat interpreted "fair tax act."

v1a0PHdwaa	Education and infrastructure, we need to create the best and the brightest and have the tools ready for them to succeed|`|8eJYMblDaa	we need TAX BREAKS    tax breaks stimulate the ECONOMY|`|wlRA8NJ4aa	Neither.       if we spend money that we don't have (Democrats), it adds to our bloated debt.    If we hand out tax cuts, and do not cut spending to compensate, (Republicans)  then, it adds to our bloated debt.    Either way, we increase the nearly 500 billion dollars a year that we spend on interest on our national debt.   This is the second most significant mechanism of transfer of wealth out of the USA to foreign countries.       The first most significant mechanism transferring wealth out of the USA is our trade deficit.       We desperately need to cut government spending across the board until the federal spending deficit is zero.  Then we must cut imports across the board until our trade deficit is zero.   Neither will be easy to do.   It will take a collapse of the US dollar, which is coming if we keep on the current path, to shock people into forcing our incompetent govermnent, both Democrats and Republicans, into fixing these two major problems.      Comments like: "Why would you spend more to get out of debt? It doesn't work"  don't take into account our already bloated debt.   George Bush handed out nice tax cuts to the top %1 of our country, and in return we got a national debt that doubled.   The tax cuts did nothing to stem the runaway spending, and millions of jobs sent to China and the far east.|`|sgZiOvkDaa	Government has not cut any jobs - the private sector has.  Poor people do not create jobs, the wealthy do, and if you take more of their money, they will hire fewer people, which only causes more unemployment.

Which amounts to about 6%.  Another source says its $80 billion or 8% but still, its obvious to me that they are not serious about infrastructure or else there would be a real priority placed on it.  Experts say that it would take $2 trillion to solve the nation's intrastate problems.  This is a political talking point to which the Democrats pay lip service.     Likewise, you now that under Bush, unemployment at one point was down to 5% and than even now its not at the levels it was under Carter?  You do know that under Bush, actual Federal Revenue hit $3 trillion, an all time high?  I content that what we have is not a revenue problem but a spending problem.    Also under Reagan, unemployment went from double digits to under 10%.  Reagan spend us into a deficit?  OK but he did so to build up our military which had fallen behind after the Viet Nam war.  It was that military build up that won the Cold War. It was that military buildup that won a decisive victory over Iraq in 1991.  And it was the money spent on scientific research for military purposes that led to the invention of items that make our quality of life better.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Education is not a short-term fix.

Tax breaks, if done correctly (see Reagan), DO stimulate the economy.|`|WTHTVJN6aa	We need permanent tax breaks. This will build more consumer confidence because people will know that they will permanently keep more of the money they make.

So no, I don't think we need more spending from the federal government, and thus we do need more tax cuts (mucho tax cuts) at the federal level.    As for state tax increases for infrastructure and education. No, we are at an all time high for money spent per pupil for education, and the price tag has steadily increased (adjusted for inflation and such) over the decades, yet the quality of our education has gone the opposite way; down the tubes with each passing year. Obviously funding is NOT the problem!! It's the quality of the education, the teachers, the arbitrary teachers unions that stifle progress, and the monopolization of education by the government, inhibiting competition. We need separation of education and state, and allow parents choice in education with vouchers or education credits.    Infrastructure is a legitimate function of state and local government, however, the way they spend money is very inefficient. They give contracts to well connected companies, not necessarily the best qualified or lowest bid. My father works in the construction industry and knows how the process works. Also, a lot of our infrastructure funds go toward ridiculous ear mark projects (we have a big problem with that here in MN). Funds go to ridiculous things such as 100K for bike paths, 50K for a city fountain, and so on. And the largest part of our state budget designated for roads goes toward.... mass transit.... Mass transit is a financial sink hole, mass transit users make up only a very small % of travelers on the roads (bus) and in their daily commute (on light rail for example), and mass transit (even at full Utopian capacity) can never match the volume a highway full of cars can move. And yet, we squander billions in this worthless endeavor!    So, a resounding NO is my answer to increased funding to infrastructure and education at any level of government. Efficiency in how the funds are used, coupled with tax cuts, is what we need!!|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Tax cuts don't fix bridges.

A true stimulus plan should Include Pro-Growth Tax Relief for Families in Every State. In order to be successful, the stimulus bill should extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and should reduce taxes for individuals, corporations, and small businesses. Doing so would increase employment and family income, shorten the recession, and speed economic recovery. All families and businesses would benefit from these policy changes, seeing an immediate but modest increase in income in 2009. As a result of these policies, however, families could expect their incomes to increase by an average of more than $4,500 and their taxes to decrease by three percentage points in 2013.    Out-of-control Washington spending isn't change.|`|AA10774878	We don't need tax breaks.

Why would you spend more to get out of debt? It doesn't work. Tax breaks and credits do.

If the government is weak, they can't control inflation (states would just print their own money). States could also raise their own armies and protect themselves, and that would lead to question as to why they pay federal taxes. It would eventually lead to secession. You need a strong, unified body in order to prosper - we learned that after our confederation under the articles of confederation.

Anyone who's emigrated to America is, in my book, still considered to be a member of their national origin, unless naturalized by the United States.     There are a lot of Americans who say, "Yeah, I'm German" or "Hey, I'm from England" and I think they're not saying what they mean. What they mean is "Yeah, I'm of German descent" or "Hey, my ancestors were fro England." This is applicable to almost every American since very few of us anymore are Native American/Indian/American Indian... and even they crossed the Asian-American land bridge to get here thousands of years ago.     America really is a melting pot as during the turn of the 20 century people flocked to America from all over the world, and to a lesser extent, still continue to do so.

It passed the house of rep. a couple of days ago and now has to pass the Senate. The target goal is the 18th of this month (feb 09). After it passes the money will be given to different departments and most likely HUD will oversee the spending of the amount set aside for foreclosure rescue. However, the money will more than likely be used to "motivate" lenders to workout a deal with the homeowners, not as a handout to homeowners.

fSlZQzS4aa	Your question makes no sense.|`|LTS3GCpQaa	Interesting      --- Black and white are odd colours to pick in my opinion , the meaning of those colours is assigned by the observer and varies from culture to culture.      For instance black is a wedding colour in China and white is a funeral colour .     It does appear an attempt to alter the general populations culture in a small manner .      Please note the best way to change an entire echo system is not to introduce a large change --- but one small one . Therefore if it is an attempt to change cultural perceptions it is not a knee jerk reaction but a very well thought out one.     Close to Christmas (Humanitarian )   Close to Easter (Violence)    Close to Labour day (Dream)      Black and white --- appears to represent a racial divide -- which is consistent  with an Anglo Saxon assignment of the meanings of those 2 colours --- It also overwhelmingly represents truth vs a lie and that is what it subconsciously represents to most westerners      White = purity --- close to Christmas -- the truth      Black = a lie or something bad --- close to Easter ---death of Jesus --     Black and White --- close to Labour day -- Yin and Yang? cooperation merger ?

He even realized closing GITMO was not so good an idea either, that's why when he issued the order, he did it with a year-long delay.
PI8VfiY1aa	With all due respect- you are confused. This house resolution proposes Federal investment in state-run public transportation as a means of creating new jobs. The Federal government is not taking over public transportation.     And you should know that the definition of the word "public", as in "public transportation" means that the system is not held by a private entity. Therefore, either directly or indirectly, public transportation is and always has been controlled by state government- therefore funded indirectly by federal government.     Your perceived point is utter nonsense and a classic case of "phony outrage".|`|ebrlN6TXaa	Amtrak always has been subsidized by the federal gov. from the very beginning.

kijIJbBxaa	Ok, time to get schooled on the Illuminati and the NWO....    First of all, it is NOT A "GOOD THING" BY ANY MEANS!!! You are in serious denial!!!!!The Illuminati is a SATANIC CULT!!!!! I know that sounds really strange and unbelievable, but it is absolutely true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's what's so horrifying about the whole thing. This cult is comprised of  Freemason/ Jewish banking dynasties who have formed a disgusting cartel over government credit that enables them to charge interest on funds they create out of nothing. They pretty much control everything in the world - money, government, education, mass media, etc. We're conditioned by the media (radio, t.v., magazines, newspapers) to think of everything as a joke. That's why nobody believes that this conspiracy is really happening - even though reality clearly signifies that it is.     The Illuminati wants a New World Order which will be a totalitarian one-world government devoted entirely to Lucifer. They use Freemasonry and their other front groups to infiltrate most organizations and that's how they gain stranglehold control over us.  We are being "designed" to be in servitude to the Illuminati.     Just take a look at how our society has declined. It's because they are corroding it. They are breaking down marriage, family, morals, religion, etc. At the same time, they are promoting degeneracy, dysfunction, immorality, and perversion of everything that is right and good.     World hunger, poverty??? - they are the engineers of this stuff!!!!!!!!! They engineer WAR as well.     Please get a clue and start researching them more in depth. And once you learn what their real goals are, please spread the word about them as much as you possibly can.|`|aV3bFchtaa	You neglected to mention the choices available for the style of chains you will be wearing.|`|MEReSvZeaa	I pay my illuminati well to act in "advisory" rolls only.  They are strictly forbidden to get involved any more materially than that.    It was only a little embarrassing the last time one of my people was exposed in public.

You know what they say about something that sounds too good to be true? It probably is.  With 6 billion people on the planet there is going to be conflict. Just look at your own life. How many people are in your family? Do you always agree? Do you ever fight? Is everything always peaceful? And these are the people you love.   This is not to say that we shouldn't work towards the ideal world. We can always improve things, but we MUST realize that conflict is inevitable. There is conflict throughout nature and there always will be. In fact without conflict no progress can be made. It's best that we try to settle the conflicts in ourselves first, then work up from there. Don't try to solve world problems before you have a good grasp of your own situation. Once that is done we can lead through example rather than forcing our beliefs on others. People are not stupid(even the stupid). People are uninformed, misinformed, ignorant, and yet with all that they are also loving and caring and if treated with respect will more often than not show respect.|`|rOPPyFNkaa	Nice try, but it wouldn't be so rosy.

Yes the New World Order (NWO) might be a good thing if you are part of the Satanic Elite that enjoy taking suggestions from the dark side:  You'll have total control of what is left of the remaining population; that may be fun for a very few.   I say MAY because the dark side has never been one to keep its word.    On the other hand,  I can see why you might find the idea of a united world government having some benefits, just not the way the dark planners intend them.  If this new government was run by the worlds people it may have some potential;  mind you I say all People as oppose to only the Elite few, as is the case today of many world governments including the planned new one.    Taking control of our own destiny is not a new Idea.  In fact, I myself have read about it in an eBook entitled "Handbook For the New Paradigm".   In this book, it states that taking control of the ball from the Satanic Elite may be possible if we work together to accomplish the goal since "Dark" energy is weaker than "Light" energy.  This is evident as you witness each of their groups at each others throats.    Handbook for the New Paradigm (eBook)  http://www.nomorehoaxes.com/shop/downloa...

It asks a lot of questions because it is intended to collect data on US population. It is more specific than the Census quetionaire because the survey is supposed to be more frequent than the Census (which is every 10 years).    The American Community Survey is an on going survey, sent to a small sample of the population; and helps to tell what the population looks like and where it lives.    The data collected by the American Community Survey (ACS) help federal officials determine where to distribute more than $300 billion to state and local governments each year. Responses to the survey are strictly confidential and protected by law.

He is already trying to push this stimulus package through right under the noses of Americans without them knowing what is in it and how it will affect their lives.  He is all gung-ho, trying too hard, has no idea what he is doing, going too fast, and that is how he will make fatal mistakes.  Soon the people will see what they truly voted for.|`|OnWmqs4paa	. US president Obama has appointed more than 17 lobbyists after talking big on anti-lobbyist Governance and rooting corruption out of the American Government.      Edit:  Dreams are dreams. Facts are facts. President Obama is surrounded by corrupt lobbyists ready to sell America cheap.   Take the example of the newest exposure of doubletalk from Obama! After calling for clean Governance, he appoints a Treasury Secretary who forgot to pay for his business tax for years! Tom Daschle, a top lobbyist in Washington, who has amended his U.S. tax forms to pay back taxes with interest, is now Obamas best choice for Americas chief health official.   Would you believe, Obama had to issue 17 waivers on his own rule in less than two weeks for allowing lobbyist enter his Administration and control Governance of America!      http://www.indiadaily.com/editorial/2047...|`|AA11459642	nope, nope and nope.|`|Hxttt7G0aa	Geez, the stuff we find out about is ugly as heck. Just imagine what is hidden?|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Lets give the guy some time to see what he can do.    I like the cabinet.  During the campaign, Obama said, We need to change the way Washington does business.  But now, faced with a crisis, he is looking to experienced people who know how Washington does business and how to get things done.  It appears that hes smart enough to recognize that this is not the time to change Washingtons rules of the road.  That can wait for calmer times.    Obama is more pragmatic and less of an ideologue than I gave him credit for.  For that, I am grateful.  Now, lets give him a chance.  More important, lets keep in constant touch with our representatives in the House and, to a lesser extent, the Senate so Obama knows what we are thinking.  When I vote for someone, at any level, I am not abdicating and asking him or her to make my decisions for me.  I am asking him or her to promote my agenda.  You should do the same.|`|4Aauh87yaa	No, I do not.|`|gE03TUtQaa	Sure Like I love Dubey and Kennedy and FDR and Roosevelt.|`|i4NkPeATaa	It seems every other person he appoints doesn't pay their taxes. That is not the change America voted for.|`|SOOu6fJeaa	I liked that he chose the people of his cabinet by their abilities and not because they were his cronies. He kept Robert Gates on and added two Republicans in labor and transportation (did Bush have any Dems in his cabinet?). I like that his posts for National Security Adviser, Director of National Intelligence and veterans affairs are all retired military men, two Generals and an Admiral.    Obama will move to make his Adm. more transparent unlike the Bush administration which has been the least transparent since the Nixon years and we all know what happened there. I don't think that it is a coincidence that both of these criminals were Republicans. It's really no surprise from the party who gave us Bob Ney, William J. Jefferson, Scooter Libbey and who gave such criminals as Tom Delay and Ted Stevens standing ovations.     Hey all of you haters! Turn off Hannity and Rush for a moment, pull your heads out of their arses, yank all of those butt hairs out of your teeth and watch our guy try to pull America out of the mess that your guy (George the bumbler Bush) has gotten us into over the last 8 years.    He has already made it a priority to shut down Gitmo. He has reached out to the Muslims (which Bush totally alienated and antagonized) expressing to them that "America is not your enemy." He has begun to address the bailout money that we gave(no questions asked.) to the thieves on Wall street. He Attended a bipartisan gathering with congressional leaders making good on his promise to hear from Republicans. He is pushing for a swift passage with bipartisan backing of a stimulus package that is intended to jerk the country out of recession.    Of course you guys will complain that he is spending too much.  What did Bush do? He allowed Haliburton to siphon a considerable fortune out of the country to "rebuild Iraq" wink wink and now they have moved their headquarters out of Houston and into Dubai, The United Arab Emirates (true story). Hey what did America get out of that deal? Oh yeah we got screwed.    The sad thing is that many of you morons would vote that idiot in again if you had the chance.

Note to Metal Mike: George Bush won both the 2000 and 2004 elections, and your Liberal Dem friends still aren't over that yet, so why should we not be allowed to disagree with Obama's choices?

eulMjLtPaa	Here's the etymology:    From Latin praesidens (accusative: praesidentem), meaning 'president, leader'. The Latin word is the substantivized present participle of the verb praesideo (infinitive: praesidere). The verb is composed from prae 'before' and sedere 'sit'.     The original meaning of the verb is 'to sit before' in the sense of presiding at a meeting. A secondary meaning of the verb is 'to command, to govern'. So praesidens means 'the presiding one on a meeting' or 'governor, commander'.|`|8rub0rKDaa	Calling him Head of Breakfast is not as dignified
AA11518835	On average, a Democrat has more liberal views or feels more strongly about their liberal views than their conservative views. A Republican is the opposite.    A Liberal (ie. pro choice, anti death penalty, pro welfare, anti-war, pro Keynesian economics, etc.) is not accepting of many conservative principles at all  and a Neo-Con (ie. pro-death penalty, pro life, pro defense, pro Austrian economics, etc) is not accepting of many liberal beliefs.

Yes, if local ordinances allow they can impound the vehicle.    I had a car break down in Upstate NY (near a town with very expensive real estate), I called the local sheriff's department to let them know the vehicle was disabled and would be moved at the first opportunity.  Their response was "move it in 24 hours or it will be impounded, period!".    Why didn't you park it in front of your own place and avoid the problem?    The towing company bids on a contract to impound vehicles for a department.  They are an official contractor to the city/county/state.  No kickbacks are allowed under the law.
TKbYavhzaa	Expand the powers of the executive (president or prime minister).  Hitler becoming Chancellor is a good example.      Giving the military power of law enforcement is another one.    Using propaganda to generate fear of a foreign adversary is also very good for goading the people along with whatever the rulers want.  For example:    "Why of course the people don't want war. Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally the common people don't want war neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."   -Hermann Goering|`|dBkEqT2naa	Use false allegations or labelling someone mentally ill in order to punish them.

As long as these types of things are tolerated, they will continue.  And they will grow.    If the English want to turn their country over to the Islamic terrorists, a process that seems to already be under way, they should encourage their Muslims to act this way.  Alternatively, the police should be well armed and shoot the hooligans in the street.  Let them have their virgins.    If this happend in the U.S., we would not tolerate it.  We wouldn't even need the police.      If Muslims want to come here and join our society, they are welcome.  But if they want to come and bring their laws and customs with them, they will not be welcome. And we will make sure to deliver that message to them in language they will understand.    Recent surveys show that our Muslims are happy here.  They like our lifestyles and our tolerance. Almost all of our Muslims are law-abiding and good citizens.

pwdv08hVaa	MOS - Military Occupational Specialty aka your job    heres the process..... you go to boot camp where you become a Marine, after that if your not an infantryman you go to MCT (Marine combat training) and then after that you go to you MOS school where you learn your particular job, whether your reserves or active duty you will go through this process    and again your MOS is your job after your MOS school you will do your job, i cant make it any clearer than that    *edit* please pay very close attention, your MOS is your job in the Marine corps, for example if your an MP you are a military cop, that would be your job    and what do you mean to make your living day to day? your pay depends on rank not on your job    check you email|`|iHpknoLwaa	Tommy haven't you already asked this question before?      MOS= Military Occupational Specialty    This is your job while you are in the military.  An example would be 0331-Machinegunner. If you are an 0331, then your specialty and your job is to learn and be able to use all of the machine guns that the Marine Corps currently uses (M2 .50cal, 240G, etc).  You're job within your unit might be to be part of a machine gun crew, or another job that requires knowledge of how to use, maintain, clean and fix your weapon.|`|JDxpjT34aa	You're question is very hard to understand. It doesn't really make all that much sense. If you're asking what you do when you get out of MOS school, you do your job (MOS), you do what you were trained to do in MOS school. Your MOS is the job you have in the military. What do you mean by "outside daily life"? Your MOS is what you do as your daily job in the military. If you're a reservist then your MOS will have absolutely nothing to do with your everyday life once you get home, your MOS is only your MILITARY JOB.|`|T0wPBwGFaa	Tommy     MOS is the militarizes way to say job ( each branch  's them different just to screw up civilians)    so I could ask the question,' What is your MOS"? , you could respond " Truck driver     Similarly I could ask you what is your JOB you could respond " Truck driver|`|RfxQJU4Xaa	Your question doesnt make sense. your MOS is your job in the military

cMHxg372aa	Conservatives nearly always have a simplistic, black-or-white view of the world based on fundamentalist religious beliefs. In the conservative movement, there's also a very strong current of anti-intellectualism and deification of traditionalism (the embrace of tradition and old mores for their own sake). These sort of people tend to loathe academic and scientific inquiry, and instead look to the past, to the unproven (i.e., God/religion) and to tradition for comfort and enlightenment. While there are many highly intelligent conservatives, this ideological paradigm does tend to predominately appeal to those of lesser degrees of intellect, education, criticality, time preference (i.e., "screw healthcare, I want a tax cut NOW!") curiousity, and intelligence generally. Then there's the working-class white GOPers, who routinely vote against their own interests because they're incredibly stupid or have a delusionally inflated opinion of themselves.    Liberalism, on the other hand, is a more nuanced, fluid, long-term, and intellectual paradigm. Thus, liberals tend to fall into two camps - on the one hand, you have steely-eyed intellectual pragmatists, and on the other, you have the emotional "do-gooders." Many conservatives have only interacted with the latter.     So, I'd say, on AVERAGE, liberals tend to be somewhat more intelligent than conservatives. However, liberals tend to occupy a vast swath of the IQ spectrum - most extremely intelligent people lean towards liberalism, but so do a lot of extremely unintelligent people. whereas conservatives tend to occupy a much smaller distribution range - right around "average to below average inelligence."|`|savPsYWjaa	RON PAUL 08|`|v4qLlGGhaa	Neither.

Qou0CLwiaa	up to the terms of your lease.    in the meantime, you are both "jointly and severally responsible" for the entire amount, whether she lives there or not.    That means, if the landlord doesn't get paid, then you are both responsible for the full amount and working it out yourself.    if she can't sublease, and doesn't pay, pay the full amount and go to small claims court to recover her share.    If you need to break the lease, and the landlord imposes costs, then she should pay those costs (and IMHO more for the risk you take that the landlord won't renew at all now, or when the lease ends).|`|AA10927745	your only hope is taking her off the lease and putting all the responsibility on yourself..and find a new roommate|`|d5c5079cce04b42e4018f3cce72b99f2aa	It depends on what your lease says.  Some leases don't allow subletting at all, others allow it with landlord's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).  If you don't want another roommate not of your choosing, read your lease.  If you have a problem with it, I suggest you contact your landlord and get her name taken off the lease all together.

Homeless persons receiving aid from all around and picking their lives up by working, finding a home and earning a living.    3.  A child with a messed up past building his or her own business after graduating from college and having the ability to live comfortably for life without having to work under someone's management.    4.  Special Olympics athletes training hard for their respective competitions and excelling in their sports while practicing good sportsmanship and receiving accolades for winning.    These things are symbols of Americans "winning" and experiencing "victory", not a picture of Obama or "shout out" to him.

Biden can't swear Holder in properly, the head of the treasury is a tax cheat and as are 3 other of his choices for the cabinet and his stimulus package is the largest pork laden bill in history.

Is9WQwElaa	Actually it is a master plan to target non-thinker's greed in order to destroy this country!|`|E9XL5x3Paa	The point of the stimulus is not spending.    You guys really should learn to start reading between the lines. Obama is actually working for what Republicans want, but in a way that actually works.    Obama knows that kind of spending would never be approved, but then its not supposed to be approved. The idea is to increase confidence in us.      Look, Democrats are supposed to initiate this by bringing the bill forward, making them look good when they see that the situation is dire enough to require action. That increases their support among their constituents.    Then the Republicans are supposed to take away that pork you are complaining about, when they object to the spending. That makes them look good when it shows them as being financially restrained again, bringing their constituents back behind them.    Then they get the new bill, free of the pork, before Congress again. They vote, with a huge majority from both sides. Then we gain confidence in the government and in the economy when we see them working together. That we know they play games with each other, but that they know when to stop playing games and can get serious about really working together when the situation calls for it. They work together, and then we gain that confidence.    And even before any spending is done, our confidence level moves up and that convinces customers to start buying again, investors to start investing again, and businesses to start hiring again. Without any spending, and moving toward a private sector solution (restoring confidence so we do this ourselves), the whole thing is saved.          Only problem is, Republicans are not playing their part. Now a huge part of that is Nancy Pelosi, who got screwed when Republicans were in charge and now intends to return in kind. But Republicans are not helping anything when they throw their little temper tantrum about Pelosi and then refuse to do anything but complain.    It also isn't helping that Republicans are trying to ADD spending to the bill. That wasn't what Obama was wanting them to do nor expecting them to do, and that definitely shouldn't be what they are doing.    Notice that when they complain about too much spending, Obama takes that part OUT of the bill. But when Republicans try to add to the bill, he steps in the way. To anyone paying attention, you can see what Obama is trying to do. He needs Republican voters on board with this so they can get some confidence, too. They are customers, business owners, and investors just like Democrats. We need everyone gaining confidence, but it doesn't work if Republican Senators and Congressmen don't play their part.    They have to start cutting out the pork, as was their role when this plan began. But they keep wanting to add to the pork instead, replacing the current pork with pork of their own. That isn't what Obama wants, and sure as h*ll not what we need.    Republicans need to do what they have said they would do, which is CUT the pork, not replace it with more of their own. Nancy Pelosi needs to get over herself.     This plan can work, Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans just need to pull their sh*t together. And Republicans need to start acting like actual Conservatives, and start cutting instead of adding.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	So you've got a better way?|`|6nS62bB8aa	Many of us here are calling it the "Porkulus Package".
6nS62bB8aa	Dude...have you tried to search the name "Rahm Emmanuel" ?    I got over one million hits in under one second. You really should do some research on your own. This place is just silly opinions.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	I like the Daily Show explanation--he's a Jew whispering ideas to a black man, and the Republicans can't have that.      But seriously, it's nothing more than Republicans are looking for ways to attack Obama, and that fish thing that Rahm Emanuel did makes him one of the easier targets to go after.      Rahm Emanuel sent a dead fish wrapped in a newspaper to a couple of "colleagues" of his; mimicking the idea of the Godfather, in which a dead fish meant that either the recipient was about to "sleep with the fishes" or that an associate of his already was.    And was most likely done to intimidate them into voting for a certain bill.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	It seems to get conservative Republicans upset.|`|X81oLqMtaa	Rahm uses the same type of arm twisting that Tom Delay (on the GOP side) did to get members of the House in line with a party vote.  Also like Delay, Rahm doesn't know the meaning of "no."|`|pnZssBg9aa	Rahm Emmanuel is Jewish. His father has links to Israel and Zionist movements. When he was appointed, it drew some protests from the Arab community in the US and some observers from the Middle East. They claimed he will influence the Obama Administration to be more 'biased towards Israel'.
pnZssBg9aa	The argument is that 'Buy America' is protectionist and would hurt free trade relations with other countries. A good example would be using domestically produced steel and concrete for construction instead of imports from overseas. The argument by put forward by domestic policymakers and those who are in favour of the stimulus package is that by doing this, more domestic jobs are created.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	The Buy American provision might be a good idea in the short term. But in the end it makes the US less competitive in the global marketplace. We need to put our people to work in the industries where America is the best - only then will our country realize it's full trade potential.
6nS62bB8aa	Brilliant point.    And I am not being nasty here. I would suggest that you refine your statements and forward them to your elected representatives. A well revised statement won't actually stop the fraud from being committed, but I would enjoy seeing your ideas gain a wider readership than is generally found here.    At this point, I wasn't even aware that accountants were in any way involved with the porkulus package. Except for sending up the smokescreen.

4uike3ARaa	Last time I looked it was urinalysis testing, or analysis. UA. Follicle testing involves the use of gas chromatographic equipment...very expensive, and requiring highly trained technicians.   Regardless of which method is used, get clean at least one month prior to reporting. That is, thirty days. No drugs. Coffee, tea and water. Yeah, booze is okay too. If you're worried about hair follicle testing, just make sure you get a buzz cut before you go to MEPS. (You're going to get one anyway, first day at basic). But just get clean at least thirty days prior to MEPS, and stay clean, and you should be okay.  Starting out in the military is an opportunity to make a new life. Leave the drugs behind you, don't talk about your past, focus on your present and your future.  It worked for me.|`|6CfYiabAaa	Urine.

XLXncQu9aa	I don't see what the big deal is about.  The Ringling brothers have been doing this for years, and now all of a sudden its an issue?  It sounds more like a group of individuals trying to get money out of something that isn't legitimate.  The thing about suing in America is that you always have that option.  Now whether the case is heard or thrown out or not is another story.  I don't see this case holding up.  The Ringling brothers have taken great care of their animals each year so why should this case stick?  Its just a group wanting money out of a failed law suit attempt.  Let them try to sue, they won't get a dime because unless they have key evidence that suggests the Ringling brothers are treating their animals with harm then they will walk away empty handed.|`|HeoS75kGaa	I think that anyone can sue for anything, and that PETA stands for   People  Eating  Tasty  Animals.|`|AA10599026	Um, I'm glad you have an opinion on the subject, but you're hardly an expert. I'd rather hear from the people who will be testifying on behalf of each party in this lawsuit to determine what kind of abuse and mistreatment, if any, is going on.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	The people making the suit are obviously concerned about the elephants' safety, and, really, if they are endangered elephants, they ought to be on a preserve somewhere, not entertaining people in shows.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	I think that we need to clear our court system of groups/individuals seeking publicity.  If there was a penalty for bringing ridiculous law suits we could end $50,000,000 law suits about missing pants or the moron in TX who suing over extracurricular activities.|`|sgZiOvkDaa	The country band Big and Rich sings a song called, "Save a horse, ride a cowboy" - so maybe they should just say "save an elephant, ride a PETA girl"|`|EcuCO4LCaa	What is your point? I guess your son also told yu that an elephant living in a 20 ft x 20 ft cage is ok because it is his normal habitat? Are the elephants incapable of breeding in the wild? Since an elephant not being chained up is cmparable to a tddler, How about you tell your carnie son to have a child and we chain it up as well.      I'm by no means an animal lover or tree hugger but your rant is meritless and you come off as an uneducated carnie.|`|AA11752525	Dear Time Traveler,                          Over years and decades perspectives change and public attitudes adopt new philosophy and ideas.                            Are animals subject to the absolute dictate of any member of mankind. Years ago, farmers could frequently plant poison to be consumed by carniverous species threatening ranch lands. NOW THAT IS PROHIBITED. Years ago, people had absolute and unimpeded control to hunt and kill all wild animals. NOW THAT IS PROHIBITED. Years ago, public display of wild animals in small cages were believed responsible for teaching public wildlife interest, zoology and conservation.  Years ago elephants, porposes and dolphins  were believed to be primitive brained species without feelings, language, memory or cognitive skills. TODAY THOSE BELIEFS ARE INCREASINGLY DISFAVORED AND UNCREASINGLY DUBIOUS .                   I am increasingly moved to NOT TREAT animals as though they are mine or others to use, have and hold.  Retention of elephants or any animals by public or private sources for mere entertainment value and without legitimate scientific need ot benefit strikes me as being oddly old fashioned and foolishly held by those seeking mere financial benefit.                   My nominal  support of PETA is their use of naked supermodels to bring attention to the obviously unnecessary cruelty to fur bearing rodents. I also oppose the unnecessary use of animal torture in testing of human cosmetics. Notwithstanding, the viewpoint that the need for utilizing endangered wild animals for very shallow human entertainment increasingly increases my support for Court interdiction and determination if this form of human entertainment has not been reduced to the modern equivalence of cock fighting, dog fighting and fox hunting.                I am ever more convinced that even Seigfried and Roy need stop breeding unnecessary and environmentally irresponsible white lions.                 Wild animals need be born and stay in the wild to serve the environmental tasks to which they are assigned.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	this has been going on for 20 years at least. PETA does not seem to be having much effect, and the issue is not that the elephants in the show are endangered anyway.
EuGsGfuJaa	I'm afraid that under Maryland regulations, it is illegal to discharge firearms on public land, and on private as well without permission of the owner.  For publicly owned land, the exception is in lawful hunting areas.  You'll need a hunting license (easy to do) and have to abide by Department of Natural Resources regulations (has to be an area that's in-season)    And trust, somebody WILL hear you if you try it in an unauthorized area anyway.  We've a bunch of arrests on the Eastern Shore for that sort of thing.  So check with the Maryland DNR first.
i0vcEyJtaa	It's possible to reach a depression because the rate of inflation is skyrocketing, we can reach hyper-inflation, something that destroyed the currency of Nazi Germany, and this hurts jobs, companies, because the unconstitutional won't quit printing, while the US government won't stop spending, and borrowing money.    The US government screwed up the economy by spending billions on the Iraq war, on welfare, on education, Medicare, federal roads, bureaucracy, subsidizing companies, outsourcing jobs under NAFTA, paying for the UN, NATO, and IMF. Everything that the government does is simply unconstitutional, not to mention the utter disrespect on the Bill of Rights by placing in FISA, and the Patriot ACT.    Believe me, if we had a depression, it will be worse than the 30s. Why? Because compared to the 30s, we don't have any manufacturing jobs, we had a bigger debt than the 30s, we had gold/silver protecting value of the Dollar back in the 30s, now the Dollar is backed by nothing, thanks to the Federal Reserve, people has less welfare back then, we had capitalism, now we have Keynes, a form of socialism. These bailouts that are planned can increase the pace for hyper-inflation. My advice to protect your savings before taxes hit the roof? Spend less, reduce debt, invest in gold/silver, foreign commodities, and hard assets. Take care.    Btw, Lassiez-Faire guy is wrong, we haven't has true capitalism since the 70s. The government is controlled and manipulated by the Federal Reserve, Bush has no real power, blame the Congress for not stopping the funds, and for not stopping spending.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	I think it sucks.

AA10025824	A drill instructor is stationed at the base he's working at.  It's a tour of duty.  He would'nt be attached to any group that would be deployed and would finish his tour as a drill instructor training new recruits to go over seas.  At the end of the tour he may end up going back to his regular job and going wherever he's needed.    And a Drill Instructor, naturally, would be someone who has proven themselves in the service, has experience and rank, and has requested DI duty.  So no, there's no way you'd do that right out of boot camp.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	No, DI's cannot be deployed while they are DI's.|`|pwdv08hVaa	NO you cant enlist as a DI, LOL|`|AA10079277	Of course you can be sent overseas, but it almost certainly won't happen until you've finished your tour of duty as a boot camp instructor.    There is no way someone right out of boot camp can immediately become a drill instructor.  You have to have rank and you cannot get that until you've served some time.|`|yFHJm6iJaa	Being a drill instructor is a job that, for lack of a better term, you apply for once you are in the military. It is usually only available to E-5 and above who are very good role models. Or at least that is how it works in the Navy.    So the answer is you have to be in for a while and achieve a certain rank to be eligible, prior to which you can be sent over seas, and it is not a permanent position.    I can tell you that nobody in boot camp would want somebody who has never served to be telling them what to do.|`|JDxpjT34aa	DIs do not get deployed while they are on the drill field. (only the Marines have drill instructor, they're called drill sergeants in the army and I don't know what they're called in the other branches). Yes, they have to do active service first. Drill Instuctor is a "B" billet which means that it isn't their regular job in the military, it's just a temporary assignment. DIs have to at least be the rank of Sgt and have to go through DI school before becoming a DI.|`|AA11540967	Good question. One must be in the service for four years and be better than the best to be a Drill Instructor. The drill instructors will not be sent over seas during their duty. However, the people they instruct will be sent overseas.|`|EM2Mn98Qaa	You cannot become a drill instructor immediately, so you would be eligible to be sent overseas at any other time during your military career when you do not have a similar job that requires you to be stateside.

The Wende case applies when an appointed attorney who represents a criminal defendants on appeal determines that there is no legal basis for filing the appeal.  The appellate court then has an obligation to review the record itself to see if it can find any issues.  If the court finds an issue, it sends the case back to the attorney so the attorney can file a brief.  The defendant also has an opportunity to let the court know if there are any issues he/she wants the court to consider.|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	I'm not sure why Dan gave you a link to People v.

Otherwise, you may have to go to the original case files (copies should be in the Supreme Court and superior court (trial court) files.  You might also see if you could get a copy through Appellate Defenders, Inc., who was counsel in the Supreme Court.      By the way, that is the California Supreme Court, not the Court of Appeal, and the title of the case is "People v. Wende."

And his programs were designed to keep us out of another fall into Depression.    Of course, while he did protect us from another run on the banks during recessions, which is what got us into the Depression, he could not have foreseen the huge spending that Bush would eventually do.  So while he protected us against a new Depression from one side, he did not realize that there would be a future President stupid enough to cause one by so overspending against what he was taking in.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	1) Wall street bankers ran the banking and investment systems into the ground.    2) The rich broke their end of the "social contract".    3) Roosevelt's proposals actually saved capitalism and this country from a socialist revolution.    4) Franklin Roosevelt was way too timid in his proposals, and stopped well short of what was needed.

Of course, it will all be the fault of the Republicans. Yeah, right!|`|17ff1a09056aeb1f5d9144a39ec4436eaa	No.  Republicans haven't seen any pork they didn't like for about 12 yrs now - they are about as fiscally conservative as Paris Hilton.

Maybe this isn't as black and white, Democrats vs Republicans as you make it sound.

It is notification from your insurance company to the DMV that you have auto liability insurance in effect in the State of California which satisfies the minimum insurance coverage required by the State.      This insurance notification is typically required by the State for 3 years from the date the original suspension would have ended which can be determined, e.g., by adding 4 months from the date you were given the "pink" temporary license (assuming you are a first offender without a refusal of the chemical test).      If your policy lapses for any reason (miss a payment, get cancelled) the insurance carrier is REQUIRED to notify the DMV who is supposed to then notify you that you will have to file another SR-22 with them by a certain date or your license will be suspended. This form, typically filed electronically, is the only form the The Department of Motor Vehicles will accept. They will not accept any other form as a substitute for the SR-22.       When is the SR 22 required?  This will be required by you if:    (1)  you were arrested for a DUI and;  (2)  you have your license suspended or restricted and/or;  (3)  if you are required to take a DUI program and;   (4)  you want to get a restricted license.    To get a restricted license, you have to do 3 things:   (Not immediately - only if you lose your DMV hearing or get convicted in Court)    (1) Pay DMV re-issue fee(s).  (2) Provide DMV proof of financial responsibility (SR-22).  (3) Provide DMV proof of enrollment in approved DUI program.       Insurance minimums in California:  For private passenger vehicles per accident: $15,000 for injury/death to one person.   $30,000 for injury/death to more than one person.   $5,000 for damage to property.       Moving to Another State:  If you currently have an SR-22 and want to move to another state you must maintain the SR-22 like you still live in California - even though you no longer reside here. Also, your insurance policy for the new state must have liability minimums required by law in California. This applies even if you move to one of the states that does not have SR-22 insurance: Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.       Already convicted and need a license?  First, make sure you are eligible for at least a restricted license by calling the California DMV at 1 (800) 777-0133. Then follow the steps above.       Other related information:  If you insurance company cancels your insurance because of your conviction, you will receive a notice indicating that your vehicle registration will be suspended if new insurance information is not submitted within 45 days.       Already agreed to enter a guilty plea or didn't request a DMV hearing?  If you think you are going to be convicted, make sure you contact an insurance broker BEFORE the conviction appears on your record. A skilled insurance broker can often times save you from being cancelled or having your insurances rates double (typical through State Farm for example) once a DUI conviction appears on your record.      Additionally, you should know that although your SR 22 can be filed electronically you should be able to get an original from your insurance company and hand deliver it to the DMV so that you don't have to wait for the clerks in Sacramento to do their job - which they do slowly.      I recommend calling John MacDonald at 1 800 346 7370 for all of your insurance needs. John MacDonald Insurance         Or, Generally, How to Downshift Your Insurance Costs with Smarter, Cheaper Coverage     1) Nab Discounts     Most insurers offer price cuts for such things as:  - having anti-lock brakes;  - having been accident-free;  - having taken a defensive-driving course;  - using the same insurer for your home policy.     (For more info., visit the auto insurance checklist at http://iii.org/individuals/auto .)     These can take up to 25% off your premium.  But your insurer usually will not come to you with them so you have to call the company and find out what the discounts are.     2) Raise your deductible.     The point of vehicle insurance is to protect you from catastrophic costs (your emergency fund should cover stuff like dents and broken windows).  Raise your deductible from say $200 to $1,000 and you could save more than 40% on premiums, according to the Insurance Information Institute.     3)  Prune coverage on old vehicles.     Once your vehicle is worth less than 10 times what you pay each year to insure it, get rid of the comprehensive and collision.  Find your vehicle's estimated worth at www.kbb.com.      4)  Dig up competing quotes.     This is the most work but could have the greatest payoff.  Go to www.naic.org to find your state insurance commission website, where you can download a vehicle insurance buying guide.       Pick the example closest to you and the 5 insurers with the lowest rates.  Call them for quo
g8CsCKpGaa	If the port you are arriving at is a "Liberty port visit", then It will depend on the type of ship you are on and how many people are on the ship with you.  Even though the ship may pull into port, it still has to be guarded and operated.  There will normally be a duty section of people left behind to do just that.  If you have enough people who have been trained to stand guard and operate the ship, then there are more duty sections.  For example:  If the ship has three duty sections, then normally the other two duty sections can leave the ship (if its a liberty port call).  The next day, the duty section that had stayed on board now gets relieved by one of the other two sections that left.  This rotation can continue for as long as you are in port.  I have had port calls of just a few hours to up to two weeks long.  Which country you pull into will also effect your travels.  If there is a high security threat to the ship/Americans in general, then you might not be able to leave the pier.  Other countries like France, Australia, and Japan are usually safer.  In these ports, you can usually stay out over night, but this will depend on your rank (the higher the better) and your Commanding Officer.  He/She will have final say on if you can leave the ship.  Occasionally you may have a "working port call".  This means that wherever you pull into, you have to stay on board and do your job, or repair broken equipment, or even study and train.  Sometimes after the normal workday is done, you may be able to leave the ship for a few hours.  Again, it will be your Commanding Officer's call.    My submarine pulled into Scotland and I had to work for 2 weeks.  On the weekends, I was allowed to go just about anywhere, as long as I came back ready to work on Monday  I also had a port visit in Crete, where I had duty the first day (stayed and worked on the ship) and then I didn't have to come back for 4 days.  Some countries I only saw from the pier.  It was not safe for us to leave, and as a result, no one left.    There are too many variables to account for, but it is possible to explore, just don't count on it happing every port visit.|`|T0wPBwGFaa	The squids are correct, being a embarked Marine I had no real duties in port other to drink, locate female diversions and explore the country, did I mention drink?|`|AA10025824	You would have time to go out on days off, if you have them, or after work for the day if there's no other duty.  When you're in port they usually schedule a way for you to take a little time to go out, that would be up to your division.  You still have a ship to operate even though it's tied up to a pier, and roughly a third of the crew is going to be stuck on the ship at any time.  There's overhauling of equipment and watches and just the general operation of the ship.  It's not like a cruise ship, but people do work to accomodate each other.    If the recruiter told you that you might want to look at anything else he told you too.    On a ship there are many people who would perform the duties of a firefighter, and security personnel.  There's a rating called "Master at Arms".  Which is sort of a police officer of the Navy, I was on a submarine and never met one but I guess they're on bigger ships and on bases.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Not sure how they run it now, used to be the ship had 4 or 6 section duty.  Unless you took leave you had to come in each day for muster, but if you had no duty that day, you went right back out.|`|EM2Mn98Qaa	It really depends on what you are doing in the port.  If you have to stand watch or if you have equipment that needs to be worked on, you will have less time to go places.  In any case, you do need to show up for muster every morning, so you will not be able to go far.|`|yFHJm6iJaa	It varies depending on what kind of ship you are on, what port it is, and how long you are in port, you rank, as well as a few other factors. On my ship, at most of the ports we went to, as long as you didn't have disciplinary issues you could come and go as you pleased.    All ships have what are called duty sections, which means a part of the ship must stay on board for 24 hours. If we were in port for 4 days, 1/4 of the ship had to be on board each day, that way everybody gets three days.    We were usually only in port for 4 or 5 days, so you can definitely go out and have fun, but only two duty sections had 3 days uninterrupted. You can't get very far in three days.
fSlZQzS4aa	They do it with their ray guns because they leave no marks on the body.|`|AA10025824	If they're a good enough shot.    Any time there are signs saying "Deadly Force Authorized"  you have a chance of getting shot if you go past them.  While there aren't likely to be anyone that itchy to shoot at you, on secret bases such as that one they have orders which probably add up to doing what they can to scare you away first (since there's obviously nothing you can harm at  the perimeter), then escort you away, and if those fail they'll shoot.   If you were to walk across a perimeter where a group of Marines are guarding a nuclear missile and you don't stop when they tell you to they'll shoot you. So whatever they're protecting at Groom Lake is going to determine at which point they shoot you and I don't think they would need to be 3 miles away.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	No.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Try it, and let us know it works out.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	No sniper rifle currently has that range (with real accuracy).

T8nap2Pnaa	Well, for most countries, it takes about 5 years from the time the petition is filed. And yes, green card holders can absolutely sponsor spouses and unmarried children, even over the age of 21.  It's longer for Mexican spouses and children though about 7 years, and longer for adult children from any country.    If you file as a legal permanent resident and become a US citizen while waiting for the petition, it can be upgraded to an IR-1 or spouse of an American citizen. those petitions are valid immediately after they are approved. however, you should inform USCIS about your petition, because they aren't likely to go look for it if you don't.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	Gren card holders can ONLY sponsor a spouse and even then it still takes years.

NYMY3savaa	North Korea, Because they are ******* crazy. Iran is ******* crazy but they are poor lol. So is North Korea but they already have nukes.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	I would go with Iran.      Neither of these countries actually poses a real threat to us directly, but one does pose a threat to allies in the Middle East (Israel, Saudi Arabia) and the other poses threats to allies in Asia (South Korea, Vietnam, etc.).    That is the reason we move against them.  They can't hurt us, but they can hurt allies and embarass us; making us weaker in the area of diplomacy with other allies.        I say Iran is bigger because I suspect if we had to invade, they would be another Iraq.  In other words, not really strong enough to resist, but excellent at a game of hide-and-seek.    In other words, we'd waste too much money trying to find them and stamp them down, without ever actually accomplishing it.  We'd spend so much that we could collapse the economy again, just as we did when we went into Iraq.    It would send our National Debt through the roof again, and that would devalue the dollar.        As direct threats to us, neither is a problem.  But Iran is more likely to keep us tied up wasting money, and then we collapse our own economy.  I don't see the North Koreans doing that, they'd happily take any intervention we would give them.|`|6nS62bB8aa	Iran is the bigger threat.    Iran has the backing of China as well as other Arab nations.    BUT...if China keeps going on its chosen path it will collapse under its own weight.

That sure is infrastructure work right there.|`|sgZiOvkDaa	The stimulus package will be even less direct, and more top heavy than tax cuts to the wealthy.  The stimulus will go to the wealthy in the misguided hope that it will filter down - riiiiight!|`|Fyq5nK4waa	The Obama stimulus package will not help America.  There is a simple solution to this problem that can be placed immediately and solve our problems without going into debt.      It's called the Fair Tax.  A consumption tax.  To understand how this will fixe the economy, we need to identify the problems.    1. Our current tax is too complex allowing errors and corruption.  Our current Secretary of the Teasury and Senator Daschle could not figure it out so how can everyday Americans.    2. The cost for private citizens to track, locate, calculate, and fill out the paperwork costs us $200 Billion.  This is only the cost to determine what tax each person should pay.    3. The cost to Business is higher than private citizens.  Business must record every transaction with different rules, different forms,etc.  that drive the cost to run their business sky high.    4. The perception that business is the bad guy and should be penalized with higher taxes.  The truth is, Corporations pass on most of the cost to us by raising the cost of the final product.  So we end up paying this higher Corporate tax.  What cannot be passed along in the cost of the product comes out of the dividens to stock holders, which are mainly our pension funds.      I calculated what I pay in payroll taxes, nusance taxes added to gas, utilities, etc., and added corporate taxes to retail purchases through out the year and I pay over 50% to the government at all levels.  This is wrong!    If we go to a Fair Tax, we would only pay a flat tax on retail purchases only.  This would allow business to grow creating jobs.  If we only went to a Fair Tax, the American economy would save over $500 Billion that would be a direct and immediate injection into our economy.
2zym4J9xaa	Desperate and searching for something!  No other options.  Promise of a better life.  Only 1 on 100 sign up, but i would say out of every 100 that sign up, maybe only 1 actually wants to serve specifically for their country and not for some kind of bragging rights.  Don't let them fool you.  Nobody does anything unless there is some incentive or motivation for doing it.  There must be some other reason people sign up to possibly die... its about desperation and enhanced stature.  What a trade off huh?  Risk your life just for a label.    I'll tell you exactly why i am joining and why my brother joined last year... because we have nothing better to do and nowhere else to go, and we would also like to have something.  If you sign up, you will at least be respected by others as serving your country, but alot of people like my brother signed up for benefits and opportunities after he's out for jobs.  My brother is in for money.  I could care less about money, i'll take the respect though if they got any left.    I would say most people don't sign up to serve their country in a heroic fashion... they want respect, honor, benefits, and stability.  The Military offers all of this for the going rate of just "your life" if you're in a combat related MOS.    Also depends on what you signed up for.  Alot of naive kids want stories to tell about wars they been in and especially Marines - they sign up just to be called a Marine.  I have an 11 year old brother that wants to be a Marine just sop he can be called a Marine.... he knows nothing of what Marines do.  My brother would make a perfect Marine... he's as dumb as a box of rocks and just wants the title.  He could care less about his country.    I love the irony.|`|dSbAz63baa	To become Special Forces and receive $60,000 dollars.|`|AA10927745	most people join the army because they have no other opportunities in life and recruiters tell them what they want to hear so they think its the way to go and are very disappointed.. the rest are real patriotic Americans who want to do a service for their country...and they probably don't have many other options either...How many rich peoples kids join the army?|`|zH4s97yVaa	Check the U.S army website.|`|3iL7V04waa	They join mostly because they want to serve their country.  Sometimes people will join for the incentives and bonuses.  The pay is different depending on rank and numbers of years of service.  You can google "Army Paygrades"  and find it there.  They give a lot of good benefits including, but not limited to, foreign language benefits, educational benefits, prior service benefits, etc.  It differs from soldier to soldier.  You can find everything on goarmy.com  There are so many of jobs in the Army that everyone's day to day life is going to be different, so there's not one way to summarize it.|`|T0wPBwGFaa	to get away from people like you, Bill, Sly99 and Rangers|`|ZWTMRrpjaa	Well there are many factors on why people join, My reasons differ from any other persons, Some people join to get the collage benefits once they get out, some to see a little more of the country or world and do somthing that betters their lives by teaching them work ethic and responsibility. The pay is pretty basic, you can see military pay charts online and all the benefits, just search it through yahoo or google it will bring up variouse web sites. day to day is different for every unit, depending on your specific MOS (job). Basic outline for your job will depend on weather you're in a Combat MOS or Non Combat MOS Where as in a combat MOS like myself days will vary between different classes and or training, along with feild training that can be for a few days or a month. When not training such as fresh off a deployment or training cycle, you will be cleaning your weapon and feild gear and making sure everything is there. If your in a non combat job such as finance or working in a hospital..ext. You will have a more normal job when compared to outside the military, get up in the earlie am around 6, go to PT or Phsycial Training, return home at 730 and go back to work for a 9-5 or 0900-1700. Hope this all helps

The prefrontal cortex must work harder to complete simple tasks(1).  Verbal memory, working memory and spacial memory are affected negatively.  Locomotor coordination is impaired. The risk of developing a schizoid type personality disorder is increased with chronic marijuana use in early teens.  These are all reasons to consider the lack of real knowledge about the effects of marijuana.  And to consider the effects of Law on its use among young people.  If marijuana were legal would more students choose to abuse the drug?  Or would the legalization of marijuana take away the rebellious thrill associated with smoking grass and cause less abuse by developing minds?

No, you will not owe any money back to SSI unless you've tried to hide the income and it's discovered.    In one example, a distant family member was drawing government assistance and won $25,000 through a state lottery ticket.  She would no longer have qualified for assistance with that additional income, so another family member cashed the ticket as her own, paid the taxes on it, and then gave the remaining amount ($17,000) to the relative who was the actual winner.|`|ad1612ddca15fe61becac03db0292b1faa	you cant' have anything that is worth over 2 or 3 grand or cash.  you have to report all your income.

1d31cfe2a1005cac4e52142de19dccd4aa	Yes he will! My Husband is Navy, I wrote him a few times while he was at boot camp. We have two children and I was kept busy! They let them write on Sundays. They are kept busy but they do get the letters. My Husband was actually the "mail guy" there! funny b/c he was a mail guy before he joined the navy! ;)  but he said to wrote more b/c he loved hearing from me and what was going on in the "outside" world. He would say to ramble and write about anything! They love to hear from you! So write up! :) He also said that they have "free" time on Sundays to iron, etc...and that is usually when the guys wrote back home. and they mail them out on Mondays. so every Wed Thurs expect a letter! Hope this helps! I also have advised a lot of ppl about graduation and such, so if you need any answers just e-mail me!    **like someone else posted...they can not write till after the first couple weeks, so hang in there!* and sometimes you will get them back to back if they write a lot. they have to buy the paper stamps envelopes, they give them some $$ when they get there though**|`|J7NH6ys6aa	yes he should be able to read them everynight|`|hbSxiTTvaa	yes  he does,  my best friend is in marine boot camp  he will have have time|`|2ZTumPkiaa	He definately will.

AA12215630	No you must wait until it is time to reenlist before you can change MOS's. And then that all depends on a few things also.    Your current MOS that you are now must be at full strength or over strength and the MOS you want to go into must be understrength. And then there are other things to look at also. Do you need to be a certain rank to get into that MOS? Must you have a certain GT score? Are you over to many years to be in that MOS? I know when my husband switched MOS's he had to get a waiver for his GT score, he needed 110 and he only had 108 and he had to get a wavier for time in grade. He couldn't be over 10 and he was at 12 years.     So talk to your Career Counselor and see what they say when it is time to reenlist. They will be the only ones to help you switch over.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	It also depends on whether your MOS is under or overstrength, and the same for the MOS you want to change to.  If your's is under and the other is over then you wouldn't be able to change.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	No, threy will not allow you to change your mos after one year.

I couldn't state it better myself.    It's odd what people seem to be saying.  First of all, each job would cost about $100,000 to create, that's the estimate, and that's not including the returns from taxes.  The $260,000 stated above was actually a value if the entire cost was applied to only the first year's worth of jobs, which is like saying you paid $10 for a single piece of fruit since you only ate one today, when you actually bought 5 pieces and are keeping the rest for later.  Oh, and even conservative estimates on job creation add up to at least 2 million jobs being created.

Also guilt is generally determined in court as we in the US prefer that system to the archaic system of presumption of guilt, isn't that one of the things we value as Americans and a principle we're fighting to instill in Iraq?

Daschle: pretty much everyone agrees that his tax issues are so minor that they'll be breezed over in a matter of days.    Gates: well liked on both sides of the political aisle.  Napolitano: haven't heard a single issue.  Geithner: people have made a far bigger deal of his tax issues than they should have.  It's ridiculous to claim that he somehow tried to dodge his taxes, since the taxes were to be paid for his employees, and he didn't now about the fact that he had to until long after.  When he did find out, he immediately paid them.  No one seems to address this.  Shinseki: well liked, previously high ranked military official who is perfect for making decisions on veteran affairs.  No one has had anything bad to say against him except that he was right on what would be required in the Iraq War.    He's still got a tremendous approval rating, and he's gotten massive support for his stimulus bill.  Even Republicans in the Senate have come over to his side on the issue, despite their grievances with the plan, because they realize the urgency and know that economists all say it will provide millions of jobs in the worst case scenario.|`|i8EYcOoMaa	Link _one_ mainstream news source asking for him to be recalled.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	It's not over yet.|`|5cc93dc15af56e8f47884e200463a48eaa	"11 days in, and Americans are already upset with him over his picks for top positions"    is that why his approval rating is at 68% the 2nd highest since Eisenhower in 1953?    "Do you think he will be recalled like most news sources are suggesting?"    really...which news sources said that?  a president can't be recalled.|`|a8s9RVNVaa	I'm surprised it took as long as it did to be honest.|`|AwhrUGxHaa	No surprise there.  I have long said that Obama was just another politician, who would do and say anything to get into power, and people fell for it.  Now that he is in power, he will reward his supporters, just like every other president in recent history.    You can't recall a president.  There is no provision in the Constitution for that.  The best we could do would be to impeach him (not likely with a Democratically controlled Congress and no evidence so far of serious wrongdoing) or to elect him out of office in 4 years (much more likely).    If you really want him to work for bipartisanship and "change", elect a Republican controlled Congress in 2010.  That will force him to not rubberstamp what Congress wants and Congress won't rubberstamp what he wants either.    Cheers!    ?2009 SinisterMatt.

And, this whole "war on drugs", is why this whole country is falling apart, it doesn't make any sense.

After about, once, I would look at different options, not our government, we all know the definition of "insane" right?

In other words, the government has been lying( oh gosh, say it aint so, our government would never lie to us). The best part is, it's "policy" to lie to the American people, and we wonder why we're in such hard times right now. Hint: government.

It's also about the size of France or Iraq. with a very diverse population of about 35 million people (that's more than in all of Canada). It produces about 1/4th of all the food grown in America and leads the country in wine production.    Given all of that, and the state of the world's economy, is it any wonder  that the State has problems. I'm not a 'Pub, but I'd say that Ahnuld has been a so-so guv. The State legislature, mostly Dem, has a love-hate relationship with Ahnuld, mostly intransigent obstruction, since he is a tad more conservative than the mostly-center-left lawmakers.    In essence, Cali is a microcosm of the world's and this nation's economic woes, and no speedy solutions are forthcoming. Like several other large states, Cali sends more money to DC than it proportionately receives in Fed payments.    Sorry about the Texas dude who didn't like it here... he must've missed out on the incredible seafood, world-class wine, awesome natural features like oceans, bays, mountains and parks. On the other hand, i have to say that of my time in Texas, if I ever left California again, I'd live in San Antonio in a heartbeat. The rest of Texas reminds of the southern half of California, the part that Northern Californians could just as soon live without. Hey... what a great idea !!!!  .

kPWGVeWhaa	I do...strictly because it's retarded to spend so much money on locking people up for it.     Also, we could be making a lot of money off of it.    I don't smoke it anymore though.
5d9pCmjyaa	Neither will do much of anything if the money is not spent correctly.    In this environment, the money needs to be spent on increasing demand.    Now who's going to spend it on increasing demand.  A very rich few who already spend all they want, or the millions who are struggling to make ends meet?    How you get that money into the hands of those who will spend it to increase demand is not as important as getting into their hands.  But I do favor the idea of giving people a $5K tax rebate but only towards the purchase of American made goods and services.  This would prevent them from paying off debt or investing it - neither of which would do squat to increase demand.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	I agree with Scott H, high corporate tax rates are what is preventing companies from hiring.  It is also driving business overseas.  Obviously increasing taxes on the wealthy won't create jobs, but cutting their taxes isn't guaranteed to do so.  The wealthy might invest in companies that in turn create jobs, but that's a lot of steps, and they could just as easily buy a new yacht or summer home instead.|`|9dEotvVwaa	I'll challenge anyone on this question to come up with a valid reason on how raising taxes can increase employment, but you can't include "government jobs".  You could certainly increase taxes to 100% and theoretically unemployment would be 0% because then everyone would be an employee of the government.    Someone tell me when was the last time that GOVERNMENT produced ANYTHING other than war.  And you can't use the government funding of private industry because that is taking money from one person and giving it to someone else.|`|xagiOb80aa	Well, what is hoding back jobs is that banks are not lending paper to businesses and individuals|`|zmmP52P3aa	"In 1942 the top tax rate was increased to 88%, unemployment rate was 4.7%"    WOW!  So if we increased the highest rate to say, 99.99%, we should expect unemployment to virtually vanish?

AA11163314	Yes, an employer can ask why you were chaptered.  And they can ask you to provide your DD-214.    To an employer who knows anything about the military the word 'chapter' is a red flag.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	no that is none of anyones business you should go see your Gynecologist right away though|`|HS7qRRiWaa	Yes, but unless there is a need to know the circumstances of the chapter cannot be revealed. If you were to apply for a position that was a gov contractor and you need security clearance they would release this info.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, in some cases.   For most, they can only say what your discharge type was.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	I will tell you that pretty much every employer you will ever have from now on will ask to see a copy of your DD-214 when you apply.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	Release to who???     Future employers?  Family?  Friends?  Just anyone who requests to know?  You're going to need to be more specific.....|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope, the military never releases anything about your service.    Military records are sealed, they must have your permission to release anything about your military records.    Only Federal government and state government can access your military records.    The only time a civilian company can access your military records, is if your applying for a job that needs a security clearance.    Military service does NOT show up on civilian company background checks.    No, most civilian employers do not ask for a copy of your DD -214    I have never had anyone ask for my DD-214, ever.    If you do not tell an employer you were in the military, they have NO WAY to find out different.    Only if you were separated after a court martial, then the felony conviction would be on your criminal records.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	just the type|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	honestly, they can do whatever they want. idk if you realized that by now|`|LWzrCu5caa	Yes.   They can release the information.        However most of the time they do not have to as schools,  employers, etc can just ask for your DD 214 and it will tell them all they need to know about why you got kicked out.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	In case you didn't know...  Your Military information is a "Public Record"  and is available under the "Freedom of Information Act...    That is how I track down "Wannabe's"...

kPWGVeWhaa	Multiple issues with this situation.  I would never allow a site to get like that.    Speak with an attorney.  You've got an easy case.  Take pictures if you can.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If you have documentation of your complaints, and witnesses, I smell a lawsuit.  It could even become a class-action affair if enough other people have experienced problems similar to yours.  Good luck.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Do you have a case for what? You failed to say whether any of your property was damaged during any of the instances you mentioned. If, and only, if the mold caused respiratory issues then you would have a case for that. As for the spiders...you could have sprayed to rid the apartment of them but elected to wait on mgmt to do so.     Personally, I can't see from what you wrote where you were harmed in any way, shape or form.    Added Note: I too was a Property Manager for 10 yrs and quite honestly I cannot see where you have much of a case at all. Consult with an attorney familiar with real estate rental laws in your area for a definitive answer.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	You have health code violations due to the mold. Also, if it's infested with insects (spiders), that's another violation.    If you can't get them for anything else, you can get them for that.|`|SOCQypmLaa	First things first...you should sit down as soon as possible and make a list of what has been lost or damaged.  Then, write down all the times you contacted the front desk (records of these inquiries would be very significant).  Next thing, do you have renters insurance?  If so, you should contact them and replace what was lost.  You surely have a case if you have proper documentation (ex: notes to the landlord, pictures of the damage).  One last thing to mention...when you plan on moving out, the landlord might hold back your security deposit to fix the damages (which were not your fault in the first place).  DONT WAIT until then to file a case.  All the judge is going to say is "your only suing now because you didnt get your security deposit back."  And trust me, you dont want that thrown in your face.  A lesson for the future, NEVER pay a security deposit if the apt. is not in top condition.  And ALWAYS get renters insurance!
AA10546011	The only answers many politicians have for any problem is to throw more money at it.    What's the "change" in that ???

I am not shocked.. but I think Obama like many others.. "assumed" that the banks would be responsible.  Now we know.. they still can't be trusted.    I did not want the bailout.. but it seems that since the bailout didn't come with restrictions or guidelines of how the money should be use.. the banks are free to interpret how they should spend it.. in 30 sec Superbowl Ads, Spa retreats, A private company Jet.. etc etc..    But the one thing I believe in is Karma.. While all these banks are spending.. and trying to live it up.. all it is doing..  is causing them more harm .. When they will really need the government's help.. their actions will speak louder then words.. and they will be left out in the cold.. Crying Wolf..|`|bkav003oaa	No I am not surprised seeing as the original bailout bill proposed by President BUSH had no spending restrictions or oversight provisions, it was basically a blank check.     Yes people could have seen it coming, but what is done is done.     Now it is important to make sure any future federal funds are spent wisely and proper oversight is provided.

There are more males because there is a call for more males. There are more Combat MOS's that only men can go into.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	No, recruiters get paid the same no matter who they recruit.  There is an incentive program for going beyond the normal recruitment rate (such as awards they can permanently wear) but a male recruit is the same as a female recruit.  The reasoning for more males in the military than females is because more jobs are open to males and some civilians feel that females don't belong in the military and discourage females from joining.|`|b9UFfsdraa	recruiters are not paid on commission

From there you can go ahead and get an apartment finder book (most grocery stores have them for free) and go hunting.

wRIF7SSnaa	In my opinion, the reason McCain lost poorly was because of two main reasons. Number one McCain reminded people of bush, who was a fiscal disaster and conservative democrats hated this so most of them didn't vote for neither. Second McCain was not the best contender the Republicans could put for their candidate ticket. The Hardcore and Nationalist conservatives didn't like McCain for his immigration policies, worse they did not like Obama. But they wanted to be morally conductive and vote for neither. This was their chaos cry to wake up the Republicans of their stupid decision. They wanted somebody more like Mitt Romney or maybe even Mike Huckabee, who had a major chance to have had won presidency. In this the Republicans are to be blamed. On the other hand, Obama has Socialist philosophies. He wants social justice among the poor people of America, and has some fascist remarks of creating a civil work force and take away some simple liberties of the US citizens. He also wants Amnesty of Illegal aliens and has been known for being the most leftists of all leftists. He was friends with former terrorists, and has marxist origins of a hippie mother. So yes Obama won, but it's the republicans fault. Other than that obama is predicted by some to be a catastrophe. You get the point? Only because he won doesnt meen alot of people will be not saying any bad about him. I hope this answers your question.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	they are afraid he might be good for the country. they would actually like to see him fail. it goes to show just how stupid they are. if obama fails we all go under with him. and they are stupid enough to believe george bush was the greatest president ever.  oh they claim how safe he kept us , just to starve to death over his failed ecconomic policies.now i will be reported . that  is  what they do when they cant deal with the truth.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Everyone who says hes wrong probably voted McCain.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	They need something to rant and rave about.|`|it2UVkF4aa	Because people are paradoxically incline.|`|AA11313983	You're trying to invent cause and effect.

rHwE5Rkbaa	Actually, there are trained Coast Guard snipers - and we have Coast Guard units in the Persian Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan right now.    Yes, our core mission is to keep people safe, but sometimes it requires that we be able to take lives to maintain the safety of our own folks.    I wouldn't use the term "trained killers," but would agree that we are ready and able to kill - and if confronted, we would be willing.    Mom of 3, I would bet your cousins are lower ranking enlisted folks that are stuck behind desks - doing supply or admin functions.  Ask some of their friends that are actually Law Enforcement and Boat Crew qualified - and see what THEY say.  I will assure you that the answers will be much different than your cousins'.|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	No, coast guards aren't killers. I see them all the time when I'm on our boat during the summer.|`|AA11163314	Anybody who considers any member of the military to be a 'trained killer' is an idiot.    So yes, any idiot can consider the Coast Guard as 'trained killers.'|`|njZ76h6Naa	Unless your in neverland, or in your fairy taleddreams, than yes,but if your not, if your out here in the realy world. tha no,.|`|22tPNksKaa	No, they are more like a Federal Police organization that can carry out ocean rescues. Compare the firepower of their largest ships to those of the Navy.    If they were trained killers, they'd paint Sharks teeth on their bows & hoist the Jolly Roger alongside the Star Spangled Banner. *ARR*    No, I don't think the Coast Guard is a joke. I was poking fun at the allegation that they could be EVEN considered to be 'Killers'.    They are very brave & underappreciated. When you're on a boat that's sinking miles from shore. They are your only hope. They have a  HUGE job since they have so many miles of coast to guard. I think they should have their own medals, instead of having to share the Navy's Cross for example.|`|3vWpUXsmaa	The Coast Guard is most certainly trained how to kill if the situation presents itself. It's ridiculous that the Coast Guard doesn't get the respect that they deserve. My husband risks his life out on the water every day and some of these people on here think it's an effing joke. ALL branches of the military deserve respect.      EDIT: Mom of 3...ABSOLUTELY I am saying everyday on the water he risks his life. Because he is a RESCUE SWIMMER and he saves the lives of those who are lost at sea or needs help. Have you ever seen what a rescue swimmer does? That is one of the toughest jobs in Coast Guard. And the Coast Guard does MUCH more than issuing tickets for DUIs  "sweet cheeks" and if you think that the Coast Guard isn't active in the war too then you clearly don't know what you are talking about. While most military services are either at war or training for war, the Coast Guard is deployed every day.  I am not discounting anything that any other branch of service does (I am thankful for everything they do), so maybe next time you can try and debate like an adult and hopefully get your facts straight and not be so sarcastic.    Thanks show&tell!!!!!!!|`|LwPcGpAOaa	NO|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	LMAO umm nope. LOL      Edit: ? my coastie:  Are you freaking serious?  So you are saying going on the water everyday is risking his life?  Honey, until he has his weapon and is on the front lines, being fired at and returning fire don't feed me your BS. Trained to kill if the situation presents itself?  Issuing tickets for DUI on a watercraft hardly qualifies.  And yes, sweet cheeks I do know what I am talking about I have 2 cousins in the Coast Guard.  Even they admit they are civilians in uniform.|`|z42u6Tbkaa	LOL you know its bad when a Marine wife puts you in your place. HAHA keep on telling it like it is Marine Wife!|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Trained killers no. Able to kill yes.     Mom of 3 you are perpetuating the stereotype that your husband, or any Marine,  has by having a horrible attitude yourself. There are Coasties over there at war RIGHT NOW protecting our ports and you don't think they get fired at and fire too? You couldn't be more incorrect about the CG. Why don't you do some research before you blast another branch of service?  And since when does having 2 cousins in the CG make you an expert?    ? my coastie kudos to you for standing up for your husband's profession and thank him for me for being a rescue swimmer and keeping our waters safe. You are correct, they don't get the respect they deserve and are severely under appreciated.    WisDevilDog grow up. You are furthering the notion that Marines are jerks. I guess being an idiot on a Q&A website sure is a way to put someone in their place right?  Way too go!

lPwdDpxgaa	On one hand, Buy American, sounds like a great idea.  On the other hand, can we risk ticking off the rest of the countries to whom we owe billions of dollars and have standing trade agreements?      Once again, Obama is putting the cart before the horse.  If he wants to dismantle trade agreements, do that first, then see what that does to the US economy.  If we stop buying their stuff, they will stop buying ours.      If we just stop buying their stuff, and break existing trade agreement, they won't buy anything of ours, and probably call in the massive debt owed, which will totally collapse the dollar and the country.    But, I guess that's what Obama is 'angling' for in the guise of being 'patriotic'.  When he totally bankrupts the country, weakens it and sells out it's sovereignty, causes foreign lenders to call in our debt, then we will be sucked into a global government and punished for being a bad 'citizen of the world'.  That's the only sense I can make out of his policies, because they certainly aren't designed to help America.|`|MLYQh8bMaa	The Republicans have studied history, protectionism DOES NOT WORK. It has been tried and failed miserably.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	The restriction in the stimulus package is not the same as setting up protectionist trade barriers.  I am not commenting on whether those barriers would be the right thing to do but the stimulus package has the specific purpose of stimulating the American economy right now.      Republicans are trying to make sure the business interests that they represent get a chunk of the government money regardless of where they operate and what cheap foreign labor they employ.  That is not stimulus. That is looking out for their usual supporters.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	no need,that is a disaster.it will lose american jobs.|`|LEBV1FPuaa	I guess we know where they get their butter!

If we are going to maintain our standard of living, we have to realize that will be other countries that will always be able to undersell our labor market, and that this works to the advantage of U.S. citizens who invest in foreign markets.    So do we keep feeding the rich...or do we do something about bringing income back to the middle class.

AA10057599	im currently putting in an OCS canidate that has tats as well.  its a pretty simple waiver to run.  doing an OCS packet is ALOT ALOT ALOT of work.  enlistments are far eaiser, thats probablly why the recruiter you talked to was pushing it.  you do understand though that you WILL be enlisting in the ARMY as an E-4, then once you get to OCS right after basic you are administratively promoted to E-5 until you graduate OCS then you will be an O-1.  if you want the checklist for your packet just let me know.      but lets be clear on this.  if you have EVER been charged with anything more than traffic, regardless of the dispostion, you will most likely be DQ'd.  even if the judge told you to not worry about it because it wont ever be on your record, juvy offenses included.    i mention that because that is where most people stumble at.    oh FYI, for an OCS contract there is NO SUCH THING as an "officer recruiter".  you have to deal with me, an NCO to be an officer.  the only way you would deal with an officer recruiter is if you were a docotr, lawyer, or clergy.|`|npMVWV7raa	This new rule will be very difficult to get around.

I have great respect for the Corpsmen that was assigned to us. we watch out for him, cause he watched out for us. and good luck|`|qPLYoBdyaa	dude, not on an officer man. Tatoo waivers are common for enlisted, the recruiters cant get enough recruits so they have age/drug/tattoo waivers.

Go enlisted anyway and be a real marine|`|yFHJm6iJaa	I could be wrong, but from what I was told when I was considering officer programs when I was in, the Navy tends to want a relatively good GPA. Ultimately everything is waiverable, but the most important part is having a recruiter who is willing to help you with the process.    The best thing you can do is find a good recruiter. That will get you farther than anything else.|`|EM2Mn98Qaa	You should try to talk to a real officer recruiter if you are sure that's what you want to do.

hmA8nfA2aa	One of the best things that you can do if you want to become a police officer is to attend college. As far as education goes, some police departments only require their officers to have a high school diploma or GED. Some police departments require their officers to have a two year degree or equivalent. Some police departments require their officers to have a four year degree or equivalent. Even if a particular department does not require a degree, you will have a better chance of getting hired if you have one. Some departments pay their officers more if they have a degree. Having a degree could also benefit you when trying to get promoted after you become a police officer. Choose a major that interests you and that would be useful for police work. Criminal justice, psychology, forensic science, a foreign language, accounting, and computer science are some good examples. Just make sure that school that you attend is properly accredited. Learn as much as you can, and earn the highest GPA that you can. Be a good person, maintain a good reputation, and don't do anything that you would not want a background investigator to find out about. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a police officer.|`|NYMY3savaa	How about you do something usefull to society and not become a cop...|`|RgNGcrkraa	You can go to college and major in Criminal Justice...

Like the one that was on the news today who pushed a 71 year old man in a wallmart on the ground and yelled that he was a cop.    His fellow officers will help cover it up and accuse the old guy of something in an effort to discredit him.    Just like that other cop who sprayed mace in that teenage girl's eyes several years ago because he thought she short changed him 10 dollars but it turns out the jerk cop couldn't count. She sued the police and won but he still kept his job to terrorize someone else eventually.     What bothers me...is that these bully cops are never let go..yet a noram citizen goes to jail for a lot less.     Why is that?|`|AA11193530	Not a class per se, but another thing in your city you should do is see if you are old enough to go on a 'ride-along'. They can be very educational about the type of work and how it is done. My husband was in the Sheriff's Explorer program in high school. It helped him a great deal. Here is the website for you to check out.    It states: "Law Enforcement Exploring is a worksite-based program for young men and women who have completed the eighth grade and are 14 years of age, or are 15 years of age but have not yet reached their 21st birthday."
