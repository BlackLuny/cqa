VM6XG5c3aa	There are several causes for a thyroid gland under producing and causing you to be hypothyroid, it's important to find out what it is.. <br>  <br>  The most common cause for hypo now days seems to be an auto immune disorder called Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (Hashi's).<br>  <br>  For most conditions of hypo the treatment is replacement thyroid hormone. As a rule it's given for life. Very few exceptions there.<br>  <br>  There are two forms of hormone replacement.<br>  1)Synthetic<br>  2) Natural<br>  <br>  Synthetic is often the form prescribed most often, though it doesn't work effectively for MOST people. Some folks do great on it, others get by with it, others will stay alive with it - but be miserable, some folks have bodies that aren't able to process the synthetic hormones.<br>  <br>  Natural still is THE choice for many that aren't able to get adequate results from the synthetic forms, though there are some folks that do do better on synthetic.<br>  <br>  There is no way to find out which group you fall into until you try.<br>  <br>  Briefly, the differences:<br>  Synthetic T4 (most common brand is Synthroid) is a synthetic formulation of the thyroid storage hormone T4. Taken correctly the body is able to process it, it is then stored throughout the body in the tissues and, as the body requires, that hormone is then converted into the active thyroid hormone T3. T3 is what our bodies use to function. If you don't have enough Free T3 hormone for your body's needs, that's when you have the nasty hypo symptoms.<br>  <br>  Synthetic T3 (most common brand is Cytomel) is the synthetic formulation of the active thyroid hormone T3. No processing involved with this one, it is ready for the body to make use of as soon as it hits the blood stream. As wonderful as that sounds, it has it's drawbacks. It's only available in the blood stream for about 4 hours after you take it... after that time it's either attached to T3 hormone receptors or passed from the body. So you often have to re dose several times during the day to have hormone available to fill T3 receptors as they empty.<br>  <br>  Natural thyroid (most common brand Armour Thyroid) is plain and simply a fancy freeze drying process used on whole pig thyroid glands. It allows them to be powdered and made into pills. Before you gross out.... read, learn, and then decide.<br>  <br>  Natural thyroid contains all the thyroid hormones, T4, T3, T2, T1 and calcitonin - already a form that your body is able to use as soon as it hits the blood stream. For those that have trouble converting the storage hormone, T4, to the active hormone, T3.. natural thyroid ends up being the magic answer to their body's requirement for replacement hormone. Unlike synthetic T4 you can take natural thyroid sublingually, just like cardiac patients take their nitro, and so don't have to try to figure out dosing and meal times so that they don't conflict. Many of the folks that end up doing better on Armour do so because they are poor hormone converters and need to multi-dose (dosing two or more times per day).<br>  <br>  It's not a bad idea to start with a synthetic T4. If you are a good converter that does mean that you only take the one pill a day. If that ends up not working for you, that your body is unable to process and/or convert it.. then you know to move on from there.<br>  <br>  It takes time to get your dose right. The doc should start you on a low dose, usually 25 mcg of T4. You take that every morning, on an empty stomach, and six weeks later the doc should have you come back in for labs.  This continues, labs, small increase if labs and symptoms say and increase is needed, until the labs show that your thyroid hormone levels (Free T4 and Free T3) are where they need to be within their ranges AND you feel well.<br>  <br>  Each time you go in the doc should be testing the following:<br>  TSH<br>  Free T4<br>  Free T3<br>  <br>  It's also a good idea to check these, too see if you need to supplement:<br>  Ferritin<br>  Iron<br>  B-12<br>  Vitamin D<br>  <br>  It's a good idea to do some research on your own, so that you are familiar with what is going on, how it should work, and what to be aware of to discuss with your doc. It's also good to know what is going on (how and why) so that you know if your doc is doing things right. There aren't that many docs that are well educated in PROPER thyroid care.<br>  <br>  Once your levels of thyroid hormones are optimized there is no problem with having kids and weight management is much easier with a body that is able to work as it should.<br>  <br>  I have a couple of pages that will give you some basic information so that you will understand what the doc is talking about a bit better on Monday. <br>  <br>  www.thyrophoenix.com/thyroid_101.htm<br>  www.thyrophoenix.com/conversion.htm<br>  <br>  It's a VERY good idea to bring a notebook with you to the appointment. Jot down the questions that you want to ask, leave space to write in the answers, and take notes on what the doc says. You'll probably talk about a few things, and if you take notes you'll be able to go over them when you get home, it will be easier as you consider opti|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	I've had it for 40+ years.

If that doesn't work, you can try putting OTC benzoyl peroxide cream on it. (one that's 5% or 2.5% preferably because 10% is too strong and really dries out the skin) If that doesn't work then you will have to go to the doctor.

I didn't want to go out with people, I just wanted to be at home because if a Panic Attack happened I could deal with it there.

You may not want to be put on medication because your worried about side effects of it changing you, but as long as your on a proper dose and are keeping in contact with your doctor, they will be very beneficial. You don't have to be on them for the rest of your life either. I haven't taken them in a while and I feel like I no longer need them, but they truly saved my life when I was going through numerous attacks everyday.<br>  <br>  My parents were the same way at first, it wasn't until a doctor drilled it into them that it's a lot more than self-control that they understood anxiety. Good luck.|`|n7qcfWxkaa	Panic disorder is REAL. I believe it's a seizure disorder, located in the frontal lobe, like epilepsy.  It needs to be treated by a medical doctor - a psychiatrist who can prescribe medication. There is no way to properly treat it with yoga, meditation, marijuana, or "socializing". That's like trying to treat a bullet wound with a band-aid.<br>  <br>  Your mother is wrong. You can't "control yourself" anymore than you could "think" your way out of diabetes or cancer or myopia.

Low dose medicine and finding someone you can talk to freely about anything that pops into your head helps.  It's usually wrong thinking that causes it.  Try to discover exactly what is scaring you.  Which many times can be the fear of a panic attack- a vicious cycle.  Write everything down; you can always destroy it later.  Get those wrong thoughts out of your head somehow.  <br>  Sometimes I'll be fine for months then something happens and I crash.  It might take me a few days to figure out the cause, or I may never figure it out.   Eating sweets seems to make it worse.  I limit my self to one cookie about every other day.   Keep searching.

You are receiving measured doses of hormones that keep you from becoming pregnant, while taking it as it was prescribed. Be careful about using a back-up method, such as condoms, if you are on antibiotics, as they sometimes interact with the pill making it less effective. SO, congratulations...you are not having unprotected sex!|`|uUsfXu1gaa	the pill is 99.9% effective so the chances of you becoming pregnant are slim unless your taking antibiotics what really concerns me though is the unprotected sex because the pill only prevents you getting pregnant it wont however protect you against an S T I such as chlamydia h i v/aids go to your family planning clinic for further advice if at all concerned and more importantly stay safe|`|dYGLyVpzaa	The whole point of the pill is that its about 99% effective against pregnancy when taken correctly.

If there is something that you can point out that is not going well in your life, for example friends doing drugs, distant yourself from those situations.|`|DAwEx4Egaa	If it's only when you're stressed, it could be just a stress reaction. However, if it's happening at other times, it could be a more serious problem. Try keeping a journal for a few weeks and note what you eat and drink, as well as your stress levels, and see if there's any relation to your diarrhea. Then you'll have a tool to show to a doctor to help with a diagnosis if there really is something wrong.|`|bQVCYSbWaa	Same thing happens to me.  Sucks, dunnit?  I spent my first day of high school on the bathroom floor and I failed and audition for a musical because I couldn't move freely, and didn't have time to rehearse because I was stuck in the bathroom.  See if deep breaths and meditation help.  Or lie on a flat surface for a while, maybe a cold tile floor.  If you eliminate the fear, it pretty much goes away.  Sorry I couldn't help more!|`|pIgSS5Nqaa	Nothings wrong with you.

C14muaIjaa	hey, I have a very similar problem with my joint. actually it sounds almost exactly the same<br>  it started when i was 12 it got a lot worse when I was 14 and has just stated getting better now.<br>  i have had countless blood tests done and seem countless doctors and no one has been able to tell me for sure whats wrong.<br>  it has been a very frustrating ordeal. apparently i have hyper mobile joints and loose tendons in all of the joints that cause me pain but the doctors and specialist said they don’t really know how hyper mobility could cause so much pain (it got to a point where it was about an 8 out of ten on the pain scale, 10 being the highest) now they think it was some sort of weird growing pains because its gotten better as I've stoped growing as much. i found what helped for me apart from moving the joint in the was you described was having at hot bath. it seemed to relax the tendons or whatever was causing the pain. <br>  <br>  i hope i  havnt scared you too much but you really should go to your doctor and get it checked out, especially if it seems to be getting worse. best of luck, <br>  x<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit: yea its annoying when the doctors dont know what to do about it isnt it? lol. have your doctors given you any pain releif? i have been on 75mg of dicloffenac which is an anti inflamitry which has really helped. how painful is it for you at its worst? like on a scale of 1-10?

Without sufficient calcium you will suffer insomnia, headaches and migraines, irritability and moodiness, terrible terrible mood swings and brain chatter and brain frizz, achy bones, digestive upsets such as bloating and cramping and constipation ......... calcium is essential for healthy bones, teeth and heart health and works in tandem with magnesium (known as the antistress mineral)...... lack of magnesium will give you migraines and headaches, nervous and twitching and muscular issues and will also cause lower back aches and bad digestion ....... and contribute to high blood pressure ..... increasing your daily intake of foods rich in both such as leafy and green vegies, brocolli, kale, spinach, fresh fish such as tuna and salmon and organic nuts and seeds such as almonds, brazil nuts and sunflower seeds will dramatically increase your feeling of well being and peace of mind.<br>  <br>  Eat more brown rice too ...... try ditching the white bread ..... brown rice will  give your brain the carbs it needs to run smoothly and your body the fuel it needs to move and get energised........ when you're low on carbs your brain has to work just that little bit harder thus contributing to depression and your energy levels will flag............ try brown rice or quinoa (pronounced keen-wah) which is a light crunchy South American grain.<br>  <br>  Eat some low sugar fruits like watermelon, strawberries, pears or cantalope ......... take it easy on the high sugar fruits like apples, oranges, bananas, mangoes, grapes...... they have a high glycemic index and will make blood sugar levels rise and drop rapidly.... it's the low sugar, slow release foods that you need.<br>  <br>  eat some lean red meat or fish or chicken also....... all you need is a piece the size of your palm daily.<br>  <br>  snack on raw vegies like carrotts, celery, organic raw unsalted nuts and seeds (just 1 or 2 handfulls daily) .<br>  <br>  drink loads of fresh filtered water daily ..... at least 8 glasses per day and ditch the sodas, pop and soft drinks if you drink any as they are all loaded with nutritionally void processed sugar and will dehydrate you terribly.<br>  <br>  wean yourself slowly off the packaged and processed high sugar and high processed salt junky type foods or the detox will be too rapid and make you feel ghastly......... change one thing at a time luv and be nice to you.<br>  <br>  woooo hoooo ....

Dark berries, such as blue berries, black berries, and raspberries.  Red grapes over green grapes.  Spinach, kale, romaine and Bibb lettuces rather than iceberg, etc.  Sweet potatoes and yams have more nutrients than white potatoes.  (That said, white potatoes are still a good choice, the trick is avoiding all the butter and salt we like to add to them.)<br>  Broccoli, carrots, red cabbage, tomatoes, green beans, in fact all the dark beans are good, black beans, pintos, etc.<br>  Learn flavorful ways to cook them that don't involve butter and salt.  Try steaming and grilling or sauteing with a bit of olive oil.  For flavor enhancers, try freshly ground pepper, lemon juice, and fresh (or dried) herbs.  If need be, you can always add just a dash of salt at the table.<br>  For meats, anything lean is fine.  Again, grilling or sauteing are fast ways to prepare them.  <br>  You might consider investing in a slow cooker.  That way you can use less expensive cuts of meat, toss it, some liquid and seasonings into the pot in the morning, and when you come home, dinner is ready.<br>  The good news is that learning a new way to eat isn't hard.  If you go to any good bookstore, there will be rows and rows of cookbooks.  Look for one or two that talk about beginner cooks, simple fast meals, and healthy meals to start.  Flip through and look for recipes that have no more than 5-6 ingredients and ones that have ingredients that are easy to find.  (Coconut milk, fish paste, and smoked salt can take you to amazing places, but you won't find them in the average grocery store.)<br>  Most cities will have venues for cooking lessons, either through grocery stores or specialty kitchen stores.  This would really be worth your time.  You will learn techniques, (what does "braise" mean and how do you "coat" things?)  They are fun and you get to eat your homework.<br>  Congradulations for wanting to take on this challenge, you will make your life better.|`|CKRJwsZoaa	Meat-<br>  Turkey and chicken are best because they are lean meats with large amounts of protein.  Egg is good too in small amounts, but watch those triglycerides.<br>  <br>  Carbs-<br>  Whole grain: bread, pasta, rice, etc.  Whole grains are good for your body.

That is usually the first cause of pain. Pain is not a common symptom of cancer. I had to cut down on chocolate and caffeine because they play a big part of pain in your breast areas. My ultrasound came up with me having a lot of fatty tissue so it was ok. You might also have an ingrown hair. I monitor when I eat chocolate alot and have pain.

lvqrtRoVaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  Adults have 32 teeth (including third molars, aka wisdom teeth.) Wisdom teeth are the last to come in and do so between the ages of 17-21 years in most cases. Unless the dentist decides to take out your wisdom teeth due to how crowded the teeth are in the mouth.  <br>  <br>  But don't get scared or anything just because you have 24 teeth because it all varys on how old you are. =). <br>  <br>  Here is a chart thingy (lol): <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ada.org/public/topics/tooth_eruption.asp" rel="nofollow">http://ada.org/public/topics/tooth_erupt...</a> <br>  <br>  - That chart will help a lot, as it does for me too (& many others.) <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped, <br>  <br>  =).|`|DpPCs6fPaa	RaGS sez : Yes! It is good to have teeth in your mouth, unless, of course, you are a baby, and then it is not so good, but just in case that you are a baby with a full complement of 24 teeth, you will not cry because you're teething. Babies should NOT have more than 24 teeth, however, and false teeth are a definite no-no for babies.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	you re suppose to have 32 teeth depending if you've had your wisdom teeth taken out or grown in yet. <br>  <br>  on a side note if you're in alabama then anything above 5 is bonus! hahahahaaha! sorry|`|iCcLGOVRaa	As a child one has 20 teeth that fall off and get replaced by 32 permanent teeth. No it is not bad to have more than 24, the normal is 32..the ones at the back [wisdom teeth] usually take a while to come out, or sometimes don't come out at all if your mouth is too small. So you shouldn't worry for having less teeth either.|`|cYtPfXkJaa	32 including wisdom teeth, 28 without. Some people never develop any wisdom teeth (like me!), some will just get two or three rather than the full set. Anything between 28-32 is normal for an adult set of teeth.

zvGvrsOxaa	sweetie just tell them what youre going through and how you feel. Make sure you make it clear that you WANT AND NEED HELP!! because i know my parents might just say oh...and let it ride a bit longer. dont do that, DO NOT LET IT RIDE. If they do not get you help, turn to your grandparents, really close friend. do whatever it takes to get the help you need because we know when we need help even if nobody else seems to think so. im sorry you have been goin through stuff like that cause youre so young...im young myself, im 16, but 13?? you shouldnt be experiencing that. just tell them ok? asap. <br>  <br>  if you dont want to flat out tell them either, you can talk to the counselors at your school and they can set up a meeting with you and your parents and you all can talk about it and get the help you need.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	Tell them exactly what you've told us, if for some reason they think that it's normal teenage angst than call your doctor and tell them and ask for their help. IF you can't verbally tell your parents than write them a letter. That's how my 16 year old and I communitcate when things are difficult. It gives each of us time to think about what we want to say and how to say it.  When the other person response in a letter it gives them time to think about what they want to say with out using words that might hurt or words they would want to take back later. IF that doesn't work than really call your doctor and ask for their help. They are trained in dealing with these sort of situations and they can explain it to your parents and at the same time give you a referral to some place for help.|`|pTmrZicfaa	Hi there, I've had to tell my parents things that were really hard for me to talk about and honestly it's easier to do sooner rather than later.

Once we all sat down I told them up front that what I had to tell them was hard for me to talk about and then I just let it out. <br>  I know it will be hard, but they are your parents and they love you. They want to help you and they WILL help you. <br>  They would rather know that your having your panic attacks and be worried about you, than not know about it and then one day have something to happen to you.<br>  So please tell them as soon as you can because they will be very helpful and they will give you the support you need.<br>  I hope this helps!|`|6wKW0urqaa	panic attacks are very serious things. you need to bite the bullet and go talk to your parents right now. they wont think any less of you and you don't need to feel embarrassed or ashamed or guilty. allot more people than you would think have this problem. im sure if you go tell your parents that you've been feeling this way they will help you to get help straight away. just be open with them. it will be hard to tell them the truth, but it ll only get allot worse if you don't.|`|UFrexNjWaa	Maybe you can go to your guidance couselor at school and s/he can help you out.It is good that you are aware of what you are feeling even tho you may not understand. Hang in there.|`|wnBkuzpzaa	I'm 13 too, and I just started seeing a therapist. I actually was forced to see her, because my parents became really worried about me, and it turned out that i was clinically depressed and suicidal and all this other crap. However, I think it's great that you realize you need help and are reaching out! I realized it, but I couldn't reach out for the help i needed. first of all, if you feel uncomfortable telling your parents, you can always talk to a counselor at your school. they really help. I would just bring it up to your mom, and be like "Mom, i've been worried about myself lately, and I was wondering if I could talk to a counselor or therapist?" Don't say psychiatrist, it might scare them or something. Plus, you don't need to go to a psychiatrist unless you're getting pills for depression, which isn't good for a teen because it hasn't been tested much on 13 year olds. A therapist is like a psychiatrist, but they don't give you medacine. If they feel you need pills, they'll send you over to talk to a psychiatrist. Anyway, you can just print out this thing you wrote to us and hand it to them. email me if you need someone to talk to or ask a question. i know how hard it is.

It will not get better by itself.  You need help.  Tell you parents that you are having trouble explaining it but can decribe what you are feeling.  They will get help for you.  Also, be sure that they realize that it is getting worst.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Print this Q & A and leave for them to find. View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Please gain courage. You should not be having fear. If you have done some mistake of if you feel guilty (I mean in real life), your repentance and self-determination is sufficient to bring you back to normal. You say you have never done anything wrong.

Be frank.|`|2dmgOpF0aa	just do it. ive been ****** up for years and have been dealing with it on my own, and CANT be done!i ended in hospital because of it.Just tell them they are your parents and they love you.|`|FUa8HBnvaa	p;ease tell your parents or your best friends parents teacher  aunt uncle any adult and have them tell your parents but your parents whould like to know first  there is a lot of help out there and please tell someone|`|pzmqNxJiaa	Most everyone is telling you to reach out to someone that you trust. And you should. It may be very, very difficult for you to do so, but it is so worth it. Reaching out to your parents or school professionals can connect you to the resources to help you feel more like yourself. <br>  <br>  I also wanted to tell you that you are not alone, there are people who care about you and want to help you.  There are many other people your age who experience similar feelings and ideas. The professionals working in this area are very compassionate and understanding towards youth and will help you. There is hope and things will get better. Please reach out to someone near you|`|0lTyS9peaa	When I was your age, I had the same feelings about my uncle whom I hated.  I felt horrible inside also.  It wasn't until my parents found out about my feelings towards him that I started to feel better.  I still didn't like my uncle, but I stopped having horrible thoughts about him.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is just tell your parents that you would like to sit down and talk with them.

gSo4dR7oaa	I hate to say it, but your friend really needs to face the consequences of her actions, not try to find ways to avoid having her behavior confirmed.  <br>  <br>  Her parents are right to be concerned.  Because weed is a plant, most people think it's ok to smoke it.  However, marijuana (weed) is an ILLEGAL, dangerous drug.  People can wind up in jail or on probation if they are caught with marijuana.<br>  <br>  BTW, if they are just testing for drugs, they would not detect any infections. However:  If her parents suspect drug use, her mom may watch her provide the sample. (Drug tests in treatment are always observed as well.) Also, if the urine is not close to body temp, they will know that she did not just provide the sample herself.  <br>  <br>  Again, my advice is that your friend should do the test as her parents ask (with her own urine) and deal with the consequences.|`|piI1aWOdaa	right... you do drugs you face the consequences
mNBhYBAfaa	sounds like Munchausen syndrome.<br>  <br>  Munchausen syndrome is a type of factitious disorder, or mental illness, in which a person repeatedly acts as if he or she has a physical or mental disorder when, in truth, they have caused the symptoms. People with factitious disorders act this way because of an inner need to be seen as ill or injured, not to achieve a concrete benefit, such as financial gain. They are even willing to undergo painful or risky tests and operations in order to get the sympathy and special attention given to people who are truly ill. Munchausen syndrome is a mental illness associated with severe emotional difficulties.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	See a shrink and get some meds.

Wanting to be sick is a way of getting attention but when it starts to be all that you focus on that it will be a real problem. Find a therapist to talk to and if you don't know where to find one talk to your doctor or call the nearest hospital. Talking to some one will enable you to figure out why you want and need the attention and why you choose that particular way of getting it.  Good luck|`|m6H5x02Kaa	definitely get help. this is clearly a problem. <br>  it could be for the attention or possibly something only a psychiatrist could diagnose. it is too hard to tell from a description like that but please seek help|`|wnBkuzpzaa	don't wait, get help now! you could really benefit from talking to someone or getting an opinion on why you are feeling this way. don't stress about it, hon, just talk to your doctor and they'll direct you in the right direction.|`|IKOsBOIyaa	um, yeah, get some help.|`|AMsT9wxbaa	you definitely need to talk to someone about this.

DM2M5LK4aa	Unfortunately I am not a doctor and if these pains continue you should probably seek a good medical opinion.  But I do know that, once your body completely runs out of food and nutrients to break down and therefore cannot convert food into any new energy, then your body will literally start digesting itself.  Long distance runners experience this, and some are monitored very closely during extreme long distances races and are fed small snacks throughout the race to ensure that this does not occur.  So try to feed yourself even if you are not hungry, small amounts will do as long as you have something in you.<br>  <br>  Also, you could be experiencing Heartburn.  Your stomach has acid inside of it that is very corrosive.. there is a special layer of mucus inside of your stomach that protects the walls from being burned by this acid.  Sometimes what can occur is that the Esophageal Sphincter opens to let food in, and it will not fully close, and some of this acid will seep out of your stomach into your esophagus, and it can be very painful.  So with this said, seek some help from a doctor.  They will be able to help you stop these things from happening.  Take care.|`|GiEinn85aa	Get back to your normal eating habits but start off slowly. Don;t eat too much fatty foods. Try out more vegetables and then get back with the junk.<br>  Your not alone. This happens to me when I continuously starve myself. Your stomach isn't just ready to be stuffed with food right away when it's been empty for a while. Just eat when you get hungry, you can get fat easily if you starve yourself for a while and eat again. You digest faster when you do this, which can cause stomach pains.|`|70ab19d1a0d8e7e1eb468613b9030ebdaa	it might be an ulcer... have you been under an extreme amount of stress or eaten a lot of acid-y foods?

Don't ask.) and when I ended up going to the nurses office every week for stomach issues the nurse said it's simply not from eating (she blamed me of course, Errr). If there is nothing in my stomach then what is the hydrochloric acid in the digestive juices suppose to do? It's going to start thinning out the lining of your stomach. Which then leads to ulcer.<br>  <br>  Edit, Edit: It's literally eating away at itself. Creepy, hu? It was for me! <br>  <br>  Even if you haven't been in the same situation I have been, it still could be the case. Maybe your stomach lining was thin to start with.

The second thing is to do is to eat something different and see if it goes away when you rest after you ate or take some medicine. If that don't work then common sense is to go to a doctor. That question is not hard to  answer and i am just fourteen years old. Don't just sit there do something about it. If you don't of course it will still hurt.

Ci19xyQ6aa	To get the pill, you can either go to your gynecologist or to a planned parenthood clinic.  The cost depends on what kind of insurance you.  You can call you insurance company beforehand and ask what their prices are so that you can let your doctor know you'd like something less expensive.  It's 99% effective, but that means that you have to take it at the same time everyday and not to forget it.  Condoms can break, so having the pill is always good to be on. Hope this helps!|`|IYoqDp9Saa	Woow, kudos to you for waiting till your 18.<br>  <br>  As for the pill, i'm not on it yet, but i've heard its a good investment. It gives you shorter, lighters periods with less cramps and more stable moods.<br>  If your 18 and out of the house, your parents will never have to know.|`|fQch3BkEaa	if your planning to have sex anytime soon than yes defenatly|`|OSh2L7yoaa	Two forms of protection are better than one! I would suggest 1.) you take the pill as it is the most effective (when used correctly) and 2.) also use a condom because the pill will not protect you from disease AT ALL. People can have diseases they don't even know they have and some never show symptoms or don't for years, so you can't really rely on what they say, even if they are telling the truth. STDs can last a lifetime and can make you unable to have kids or even die - SO not worth it! Condoms are key.<br>  <br>  As far as how to get the pill, check the Planned Parenthood website for a location near you. They are an awesome organization that will usually take you on a walk-in basis. They will talk to you and help you figure out which pill will be the best to fit your needs - there are so many kinds out there. They are confidential and caring and will not judge you. <br>  <br>  Contraceptives used to be free through PP ages ago, not anymore .They have you pay on a sliding scale (taking into account if you have insurance or not, whether you have a job, how much you earn etc.) If you're broke, you'll probably pay very little. I think my pills cost $16 a pack even when I had an okay job.<br>  <br>  You're not alone wanting to do this without parents knowing. It is your life and your choices and you should be proud you're being safe and asking questions. <br>  <br>  If there is no PP near you, remember your doctor is bound by law to keep your information confidential. You have a 5th and 14th Amendment right to privacy. You are an adult, and you could sue the doctor if they told your parents anything.<br>  <br>  Call the doctor and say you'd like to go on the pill. If you haven't been in for a pap test, they will make you an appointment to come in for that just to make sure you are healthy, then they'll ask you some questions and give you a prescription. If you don't have health insurance, be sure to try and ask them to prescribe a generic, they are the same pills as name brand but cost less. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|txkTyn0laa	Using condoms AND on birth control! its hard to break through both, and you're 18 now, you don't have to talk to your parents about this stuff so just go to your doctor and ask for it, it can be free with certain insurance or it could cost  to 50, if you don't wanna go to your doctor to get it you can always try a planned parenthood, its mostly free or it depends on income, if you don't work it'll be free most definitely|`|y2XKYhsyaa	if you know if a free clinic in your area they will give you birth control for free. they also treat stds. the one in my area is called Family Planning. they dont contact your parents or anything. if you are just going to use a condom i would still have him pull out before he orgasms if youre that worried about it.

The receptionist would never have given you this information, nor would the nurse. The doctor would have been required to do this. I would go back to this physicians office and ask to see the test results for yourself. Then you will know for sure that the test was done, and that the test results were, in fact, negative...they are your results and you should have access to them.|`|Ff15178saa	chill out relax if your dr told u it was negative its negative she should have also told you to come in again in 6months if you want to , that is what they normal tell someone she told you a week because that is what she had to she dont know how exactly long it will be she is not the person study the blood she just gets the blood test result|`|uUsfXu1gaa	if this is the case then shes broken the law but its highly unlikely doctors have to adhere to a code of practice i suggest you go back to the doctors and find out what may be going one also its never a good idea to lie to health professionals they are there to help you and if you lie and run in to complications its your life and there careers on the line i think you need to talk to someone who can help you with the feelings youve been having tell them the truth they cant do there jobs properly other wise|`|WgAPWvYRaa	dude doctors can't lie about the tests they make if they did then you might probably go around and infect a huge amount of people all because she lied to you.

Bulimia is when you throw up after eating to be thin. Also with bulimia, you binge and purge. Binging is eating a ton of food, and purging is when you throw it all up. If you believe you have an eating disorder, it is best to talk to a counselor, teacher, or  parent to help you get past the disease.|`|Rvs1mVqwaa	previous answer is right...but just know that bulimics usually don't lose weight.  The vomiting still allows a lot of calories to stay in, it causes the stomach to stretch and be able to handle more food each time you binge, and vomiting can also lead to an imbalance in all the important nutrients your body needs so you end up with cravings all the time.

Couldn't help myself!<br>  <br>  Now for your real question, lube and condoms is something that anybody can buy, and by national recognition, they can't refuse you a condom because of age, hoping prevent unwanted pregnancies or the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. std's<br>  <br>  A clerk who refuses you or embarrasses you when you buy these, can and should be fired even if it's a woman.<br>  If you have an old jacket in the back of your closet that you never wear, and you mom or no one would be interested in looking at it or into the pockets...keep your personal Dude stuff in there!<br>  <br>  Another place is under your bed mattress, about the middle, between the mattress and the box springs. If someone other than you makes the bed, they won't notice your stuff there.  That's where I used to put my private stuff. If my mom found it, she honored my being a young Dude and never ever said or let on.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps Man<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|3AY5lS9saa	Just buy it and hide it well or get an older mate to get it for you and keep it at his house|`|c6LDiUVzaa	Im 16 and ive bought condoms before...<br>  but you cant buy sex<br>  its illegal|`|c7YVksUlaa	Legally, a salesperson cannot refuse to sell you condoms based on your age.  This is because you are trying to protect yourself and if they refuse, you could sue them b/c you got an STD or a kid....<br>  <br>  If you have money and transportation, go to any drugstore, Wal-Mart or Kroger and you can buy them in the pharmacy section.  A sales person should be able to help you if you have questions.<br>  <br>  As for lube, you can buy lotion anywhere, if you want sex lube, well, the places that sell condoms sell that too.  I doubt they'll refuse you, unless you are being really immature and childish, but I'm not sure.  Just never use ANYTHING oil based with a condom, like vaseline or baby oil b/c it will destroy the condom and be useless.<br>  <br>  As for buying sex....I'm pretty sure that's illegal except in Vegas...|`|MgMsMExPaa	Please do not buy sex, you are taking your life into your own hands. The people who do that for a living are desperate, generally are involved in the drug trade and do not care about you or your health.<br>  These are the diseases that are common in the sex trade, HIV, HPV, Hepatitis,c, a. All the venereal diseases plus TB, MR SA. and some Other forms of Staph. Mono, Herpes.<br>  One other thing to consider is that if you pay for sex at your age you may never get the sex you may just get robbed or kidnapped. <br>  At your age you could suffer 30+ years with one of the above illnesses before you die. <br>  Maybe you should rethink this before you make a huge mistake that will ruin your life.<br>  Condoms, lube can be purchased at any drug store and most pharmacies. Condoms are available at all STD clinics just for asking. They|`|gnIEDg6maa	If you are old enough to have sex, you ae old enough to go the store and buy condoms.  I know you will be shy at first but really, no one cares about it one way or the other.  Do this, Get a small basket.  Buy deodorant, hair gel or dream, razor/blades, toothpaste and several kinds of condoms.  Throw in a magazine if you want to hide from other customers. It's no big deal and although your parents will not want you to have sex, if you are having it, they will be glad you are using condoms.  I know, you may just want to cook some over at first to try them on, etc.  It is OK.  No one cares or will shout,"LOOK! a BOY IS BUYING CONDOMS."  My spelling is pretty bad, too, like your.  I use the spell checker and I find that by using it regularly, my spelling is getting better. Good luck Sweetheart.  Your feelings are normal and store clerks see boys just like you every day.|`|mMmNEljxaa	Are you tagged by them or something?

Drink ten water bottles a day throughout the day, it will 100% be gone, you should be fine anyway.|`|CCyqHFAGaa	i promise you will pass that test. they only say it takes 30 days to fully get rid of THC (which i assume you are talking about)  to scare you. it usually takes longer in men, or the more fat you have in your body because THC dissolves in fat. if you ever smoke like maybe a week before your test, there are products (mouth washs) thhat mask anything in your system for a 5 or so hour window.  you take it up to 5 hours before your test and NO it definitely does not show up!!! whoever told you that was BSing you. i have heard though that if you drink lots of water (doesn't help at all) it will show up that you have drank alot and will usualy schedule for another test.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Should be fine, though no guarantees.<br>  <br>  Long term just don't do it.|`|28d6b247dbaac5aea6f4f1980e00962baa	I think that you'll be fine.

One common reaction is to cause decreased blood pressure while standing and increased blood pressure while lying down, causing people to faint if they stand up too quickly. There is no evidence that pot use causes persisting hypertension or heart disease; some users even claim that it helps them control hypertension by reducing stress.<br>  <br>  One thing THC does do is to increase pulse rates for about an hour. This is not generally harmful, since exercise does the same thing, but it may cause problems to people with pre-existing heart disease. Chronic users may develop a tolerance to this and other cardiovascular reactions.|`|qjhlDiFHaa	marijiuana is safer then any medical drug out there <br>  <br>  smoke up

But you should try to just exercise more, running is the best exercise, and if you do run, keep running at the same speed for like an hour or 30 minutes.  Drink lots of water, and eat mostly fruit and vegetables! And don't forget to have your milk!  And our vitamins.  But like the other guy said, try eating only 1000 calories a day, and don't skip meals, because then your stomach will think you are on starvation, so it will automatically start eating the fat in your stomach, so it will get you fatter!

ZjhQ6PL8aa	There are quite a few painkillers out there.  The best thing to do is talk to the cardiologist who will compare her current meds with the available options so there are no drug interactions.  That's one of the biggest problems you can have when you take different meds.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	Now...due to the serious condition of your wife and I am not a qualified doctor...I do suggest that you CHECK with your doctor prior to taking up my suggestions for a pain killer:<br>  1) Paracetmol (Panadol). As far as I know this medication would be the most appropriate for anyone with any condition except a liver condition. However paracetmol is only an analgesic...not an anti-inflammatory. So with back pain which may be related to arthritis and it's associated inflammation paracetmol would perhaps work for 4 hours or so.<br>  2) NSAIDS. Now these painkillers (Nurofen, Feldene, Voltaren). are anti inflammatories...however they are unsafe for persons who may be susceptible to stomach problems (e.g may cause stomach bleeding). As these work the same as Aspirin...they would be as well beneficial as an aid to better circulation.<br>  Now I have another suggestion for your wife. Has she tried acupuncture for her back pain? This I would say would be more preferable as a treatment. Check with your cardiologist|`|lophd4T4aa	I am not a doctor yet so I am afraid to offer any actual drug suggestions. Although if you asked her doctor I am very sure that he would have a few options for a patient in her condition. I would imagine there would be a analgesic that is safe for heart patients. <br>  <br>  This would best be left to a professional I would again advise seeking the advise of her cardiologist also because he knows her personal situation. Anyone can Google around for an answer but only a trained medical professional can interpret her personal situation and make an informed decision. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your search.|`|29cIlSwgaa	You have NOT mentioned what is the Heart Problem from which your wife is suffering ? <br>  <br>  Normally all ordinary pain killers like aspirin, disprin, etc make the blood thinner and HELP heart Patients. <br>  <br>  Most Heart Patients take ASA, Cloprigel, Ecosprin or other Blood Thinners. But Half Baked Knowledge could be dangerous, so either tell us the exact heart problem she has or consult a cardiologist on phone.
mSjglSI6aa	If you can get to the health food store, pick up some GrapeFRUIT Seed Extract (GSE).  It will be around $10.  You want the liquid type.  Mix 10 drops in 5-6 oz of water.  Put about 10 drops of the mixture in your ear.  Gargle with the rest and swallow. You will want to chase it with something strong like pineapple or grapefruit juice.  My son likes to brush his teeth first, says it doesn't taste as bad that way.  You should notice an improvement quite fast.

I still go to therapy and I have a very special person in my life that I can talk to about those things if I want to.  You learn to deal with things by dealing with them through therapy and by reminding yourself how far you've come and that you don't want to go back. You have to want to change to the point of wanting it more than any thing else.  When that happens the urge to let into your anger will lessen because you'll know what you'll lose if you let go.  You have to remember that your life is changing and can change more if you're still willing to do the work.

There are something like 100 strains of HPV, a few of which cause genital warts and/or cervical cancer. If you don't have HPV, as your doctor told you, than you have nothing to worry about with the abnormal results.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	From what I know, an abnormal pap smear means that they found abnormal cells on your cervix. Maybe they were the wrong shape, or they're growing too fast, or whatever. They are not regular, but they are not cancerous either.<br>  <br>  You'll have to confirm that with your doctor, but I think that's what it means.|`|AA11789493	It just happens sometimes,  Listen to you doc and get the pap smear in 6 months.  HPV is the Human Papiloma Virus.  It comes from having sex with someone who is carrying it and usually occurs because of sex with a lot of partners (not a good explanation).  HPV has been proven to lead to cancer

Probably during the massage a subluxation was caused and pinch a nerve.  The numbness and localized pain are two clear aspects that point to needing to be seen my a chiropractor.  And you probably will need to go as soon as you can because they will need to do xrays before they can treat the area.  Doing xrays allows them to see the damage before they treat.

You're probably still sensitive from the work that was done. but sometimes a tooth can fracture after a root canal,  and sensitivity to tapping and chewing would be the symptom. <br>  OR, the temporary crown could be a little high and you may be banging on it.<br>  The only other scenario is that you have another canal the Doc missed. This happens sometimes. There is a canal referred to as the MB2 (mesial buccal 2). They are HARD to find when they exist. If left undiscovered it also can cause sensitivity.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	I had that same problem when I got my last Root Canal. I went back a week later, and here's what my Dentist said. Apparently most of the soreness is from the sorrounding gum area, and it tends to last longer depending on the severity of the cavity, and how much of your tooth was removed. There can also be lasting soreness if they had to put a spacer between that tooth and the tooth next to it during the build up process. You should know if they had to put a spacer though, as it is pretty obvious when they are doing it.<br>  <br>  There is a possibility that they did not get all of the nerve and/or cavity out as well. Usually they do an XRay at the end to determine if they have or not.<br>  <br>  Best to let your Dentist have a look at it, but its most likely just soreness. My tooth also hurt way worse the week after I got a Root Canal then the week before, but now its absolutely fine, and I don't even have a crown on it.|`|U4JNn07waa	I've had 2 root canals and on one the same thing happened and they had to go back in and remove more|`|PjyP8yEiaa	Definitely talk to your dentist. Like others have mentioned before it could be the temporary is too high!!! Also it could just be sore from getting the root canal and crown prep done. And the last reason is there are other canals that could have been missed and could be causing pain. (I have seen general dentists try to do root canals and do crazy things like go straight through and miss the entire canal!!)
wwP3ONCFaa	Apple Juice give you DIARRHEA!. <br>  <br>  Keep liquid levels high. The type of food you eat doesn't really matter that much, The most serious thing is to make sure your fluid intake is high.Though many folks don't feel like consuming large amounts of liquids during bouts of diarrhea, all our experts agree that increasing your fluid intake is vital to ward off dehydration.<br>  <br>  Fluids that contain salt and small amounts of sugar are particularly beneficial, as they help the body replace glucose and minerals lost during diarrhea. A good "rehydration fluid" can be easily made by adding 1 teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of salt to 1 quart of water.<br>  <br>  A more complex but tastier mix can be made by adding 1/2 teaspoon of honey or corn syrup and a pinch of table salt to 8 ounces of fruit juice. Stir well and drink often.<br>  <br>  For those who don't feel like making anything, Gatorade comes highly recommended. It contains glucose and electrolytes in sufficient quantities to replace those being lost by your body. (Now if you can just get somebody to run to the store.)|`|S4tstFgaaa	pepto... lots of pepto my friend.

NLAek2bJaa	Wow. Thats crazy. I would never pay that much money for an exam and xrays. Our dentist office charges about 100 dollars for your usual 4 bitewings, thats all you would need, and an exam and cleaning. <br>  If you are a new patient, we do one more xray and still the total maybe is around 140 dollars.

You need to go to a public health clinic the next time you see them...if you see them.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	With DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) most people with borderline recover.  It gets better as you get older. If you don't have fear of abandonment or "emptiness" then it isn't borderline - there is a HUGE amount of overlap between bipolar and borderline - your depression may actually be bipolar disorder.  Also, most people with borderline have been sexually abused, so really, it is a form of PTSD. Google "complex ptsd" for more info on this.  DBT helps people who do not have borderline also, I am told.  I have bipolar and have been sexually abused, and got labelled borderline many times, but I have no fear of abandonment, many good, long term relationships, and no "emptiness" whatever that is. People get misdiagnosed a lot. So keep an open mind, and question the diagnosis if you have good relationships with others and no abandonment issues.

fMilDRgLaa	Well, autoimmune diseases can overlap and the symptoms for many are the same.  It is tough to diagnose and it is VERY possible you have both.  I was diagnosed with Lupus and Sjogrens Syndrome 4 years ago and recently within the last year the doctors "think" it is just Sjogren' s Syndrome.  It is hard because Sjogren's mimics Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, MS, chronic fatigue syndrome, etc.<br>  <br>  I know it is very frustrating when your doctors don't even know for sure.

At 14 no one should be seeing them but you anyway so you shouldnt have an issue with them. Wait a couple of years and see how you feel about them. Its a good idea not to get too down on yourself about them now and just appreciate them how they are. They will probably change over time as they get bigger and fill out more.

73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	Yeah. You're screwed if you hit a vein- you'll definitely have to go to the hospital and if you don't you will bleed out. Those are major blood vessels. PLEASE don't intentionally try to hit a vein. That being said, most don't hit veins when they cut. I've self-injured for years and I've never cut a vein. If you must cut, I reccomend you don't cut your wrist.

k4EtI2Avaa	Get over it slowly is my best advice. Firstly, do your best to stop staring at her. Little by little. Then try to stop thinking of her. You can get over her if you put your mind to it.<br>  Good luck. :)|`|CBo23fuOaa	well never say never, look i am a girl i know what girls want. first make a make over to you if you say you dint have a chance, if you are a  little over weight be  in a diet ir do exercise. next once you are done with the "make over" be close to her just find a ex use to talk to her then maybe she will listen to you <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	Become her friend. Invite a group of kids (girls and boys) to a movie together. Then you'll get closer to her and learn more about her. This will make her become your friend and then you wont feel as bad every time you see her. <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|d52d762550191151e6a8c64945c375f6aa	Smile at her, wave, get her attention. It doesn't matter what other people think of her if you like her so much. Talk to her a little and see how she is.|`|xXt8DJxnaa	Be friends with her. Be her friend first! Depending on her personallity, she may turn you down anyway but it wouldn't at all hurt to be friends with her first.|`|8sB8ASncaa	You know you could just talk to her. Show her some respect. I bet since everyone thinks she is a ****, no one shows her any respect.|`|ZTXRF7fuaa	There's no reason to stop thinking about her or staring at her. Just don't talk about it or let anyone see you. That's what makes life fun. Try flirting with her one day, and then ignoring her completely the next day. Then be a little rude, then flirt with her again. I don't know. I am a girl. That's what usually works on me, although I don't think they do it on purpose.<br>  <br>  But don't listen to the people that say to be friends with her. Seeing as you're still in school, you're young. And love is a game. She's not looking for a husband to treat her right. She's looking for someone that turns her on, and the "friendly guy" isn't going to do that. Seriously, make her wonder what you think about her. Don't throw pencils or anything, just make her wonder.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	A third person, I feel, should not mediate, unless we are parents or close friends or relatives known to all.|`|qWyZ94Iqaa	try to make friends with her!<br>  if you don't have a chance of going out with her, then being friends is so much better than nothing.<br>  nd you might even be able to work you're way up from there!<br>  <br>  good luck(:|`|MFMFIqhpaa	Try to find a girl you would have a chance with and try to think about her more.  Eventually you will stop thinking of the other girl and focus on this girl hopefully.  Hope I helped :)|`|uin3ffWDaa	i've been where you are and it sucks. you just have to will yourself to get over it and not let your self think about it. objectively speaking how do you know you don't have a chance with her?|`|YGYMocGRaa	just take the dream of dating her...and let it die! thats what works for me everytime i meet someone too good for me|`|9BbV2xqIaa	if everyone thinks she's a ****, then obviously no one is her friend or her boyfriend, am I right?<br>  well soon that will be no one except *you*. if it's true that no one likes her because they think she's a ****, and you know that she's not, you need to go and approach her and at the very least make friends.<br>  even just letting her know that you know what everyone else thinks about her isn't true, can start a friendship. and once you start a friendship, you could end up going out with her.<br>  just let her know that you don't believe the crap everyone says about her.<br>  I guess she just needs to know that you respect her, and if no one else does, then she might gravitate towards you.
k1k8cCIgaa	I don't know if it works for loosing weight but i know it works for cleaning your body, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and stay away from processed/ packaged foods or wheat products. dried fruits and nuts are great and to keep up your protein eat organic oily fish like salmon or mackerel also eggs are good in moderation. make sure you drink gallons of herbal teas they are fantastic and non-dairy milk such as rice or soy.<br>  <br>  Its hard to stick to for any person but honestly after a month you will feel Absolutely wonderful its really worth it! as for loosing weight just keep at it, maybe exercise with a friend to keep motivated and don't take on to much at a time, just do a walk in the morning and a walk at night and gently increase that, when you get into a rhythm it gets a lot easier.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	I don't care about the points - these are all scams!!  They irritate your digestive system more than anything.  My gastrologist will not recommend anything like this and he is a professional. He told me to read the disclaimers and use common sense.   So use common sense and read the disclaimers.|`|l7g5JBEEaa	I like to do juice fasts.  I own a juicer and bought a juice recipe book.  use only organic fruits and vegetables.

Quick answer: Your on the right path. Its good to see your stomach growing. Lots of proteins will help build your ab muscles. It will take some time before the muscle overtakes the fat unless you are doing cardio. Oh, and eating after night is really BS. Your body doesnt know when night comes. Eating before you sleep keeps your body warm actually because its digesting food. Anyone who says the food you eat immedietly turns to fat because its late at night is wrong. No matter what time of the day, the body digests food to absorb as much nutrients it can. What makes the night time any different? Just make sure what your eating before bed isnt a meal. Keep it small.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes. Keep up with the ab workouts and youll definatly see them start to rip through. Make sure you eat your protein for those abs to grow and your workout wasnt all a waste. Good luck!

AA12202402	Huntington's Disease Genetic Test - What is Huntington's Disease?<br>  Huntington's disease is a rare condition that causes parts of the brain to break down, or degenerate. It is also called Huntington's chorea. The disease causes rapid, jerky body movements and the loss of normal mental abilities (dementia). The disease can cause personality changes, behavior problems, and memory loss. Symptoms of the disease usually develop after age 40. There is no known cure for the disease. Treatment with medicines may help control the involuntary movements and behavior changes.<br>  <br>  Huntington's disease is caused by a changed, or mutated, gene. If you have a parent with the disease, you have a 50% chance of getting the changed gene and the disease. But there is no way to know when you will develop Huntington's disease. Some people may pass on the changed gene to a child before knowing that they have the changed gene.<br>  <br>  A blood test can show whether you have the changed gene. You may want to have genetic counseling if you are thinking of having the test. Genetic counselors are experts who can explain what the test means, tell you the benefits and risks of the test, and answer your questions. But you make the decision about whether to have the test|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	there are treatments for the symptoms tetrabenazine treats the involuntary writhing movements. unfortunately nothing treats the disease completely or stops it from running its course it only slows it down.and i luv to watch house too just remember that house is what it is just a show as informative as it is so never try to diagnose your self based on it i've learned the hard way. pay your doctor a visit and have him tell you more.

Thanks for asking.|`|bS24vKqZaa	neither, a mans a man harry chest
cb2NxPERaa	No, the left over calories could be a lot of different things, healthy or unhealthy. 10 grams of fat is 50% of your recommend daily fat intake. So it's not okay, you just had half of how much fat a person should have a day.|`|IeOeYOJ3aa	Not really. No. People only say fat is bad because there are more calories in a gram of fat (9 calories in every gram) than there are for protein and carbohydrates (4 calories in every gram for both). But just because it has more calories does not mean it is bad for you, remember, everything in moderation.|`|lYQgf4sCaa	it's still calories at the end of the day. Fat doesn't make you fat...calories make you fat. eating good calories is gonna make your body feel better. <br>  good carbs- bad carbs. still a carb.. all gets stored the same way, as energy to burn off (no excercise, no burn off = fat)  1gram protien = 4 cal's  1gram carb's = 4 cal's 1gram fat = 9 cal's

Np0Y3vUCaa	You can spit those secretions out, but swallowing won't hurt you. Most of the pathogens that can be in phlem die in the GI tract due to the low stomach PH. Believe it or not you actually swallow mucus constantly throughout the day and don't realize it. Their are little structures in your pharynx that send the stuff from your sinuses and the back of your nose. It slides into your throat and you swallow. Sounds gross, but is perfectly natural and safe.|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	idk, but i cant imagine swallowing back is good for you.. probably better to spit it out, but I never learned how to do it.
Np0Y3vUCaa	Vitamins are good to take and orange juice is good for you, but there are no real cures for your cough(if it is from viral infection). A productive cough is not necessarily a bad thing in the short term. If it persists for more than a week go see a doc. An expectorant won't do anything for you if it is already productive. That is used to make a dry unproductive cough more watery and productive. If you are annoyed by coughing spells and can't relax the best thing to do is take a cough syrup, but you don't take those. Drink plenty of fluids to keep the cough productive, it should pass. If it doesn't or you start getting any chest pains gp see a doc.|`|92T6OdWBaa	yes vitamin c helps alot, also sugar helps calm the throat! Another think you could take is ginseng (the only ingredient in ColdFX).|`|PcPswmv5aa	No they won't help you.  And if you don't want to take an expectorant and a mucolytic then you will keep on suffering.  Enjoy.|`|73fa1d799d3ce3c53b01984cb818b944aa	the orange juice help to moisture you throat but cough is cause by virus or bacteria irritation of bronchial, if you have productive cough with yellow sputum, may need the antibiotic, some medication can sedative the cough, I know some herbal can also help to sedate the cough, most important is rest, if cough persist for more than a week, need to see the doctor, maybe chest X-ray or do sputum culture if necessary.
myhTgsdMaa	RICE is the acronym:<br>  Rest<br>  Ice<br>  Compression (ace bandage)<br>  Elevation (put your ankle above your heart)<br>  <br>  In other words, lay on the couch with your ankle on a stack of pillows w/ ice (frozen bags from freezer work) wrapped around it and CHILL!<br>  <br>  They say do this at least 10min/3x a day.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel better in a couple of days, you may need an xray.<br>  <br>  Oh, and stay off of it as much as possible!|`|eVvohzxMaa	No, a boot is not going to help a sprained ankle. You should stick with the ace bandage and possibly crutches if it is that bad. You need to stretch it a lot and put pressure on it at times, otherwise your muscles with tense and get stiff, makes the pain worse. If you stretch and put pressure on it, it will loosen the muscle and not make the pain hurt so much.<br>  <br>  While you have the sprained ankle I suggest you keep it elevated and iced. You should regularly take Ibuprofen you decrease inflammation (which is what hurts) and make you ankle feels bunches better. <br>  <br>  PS-A HUGE thing that will make you feel the best is staying hydrated. Drink lots and lots of water!<br>  <br>  Feel better!|`|AAUlXoVcaa	ugh i think you should stick with the ace and cruches so yea see if it gets better i have a ace on my wrist right now =(|`|0Lhftbzmaa	u dont need a boot. just take it easy and ice it. my friend recently sprained her ankle and she only used crutches for a couple days. good luck and hope i helped|`|ePybeRq0aa	I sprained my ankle on tuesday and I am using an ace bandage and I am trying to find crutches.
DAwEx4Egaa	Maybe - you may have a urinary tract infection, in which case a prescription can help. If you have pain when you urinate, are urinating frequently, or feel the urge to urinate but can't, odds are it's an infection. If not, it may be something more serious - either way you should see a doctor soon.|`|xYqrCYuFaa	Yeah kinda...<br>  You should definitly see a doctor.|`|8q82dLS8aa	umm...YES!!!!!

TyqGdBw1aa	your on your way to success but there are a few things you need to realize about having a flat stomach is not only running and eating healthy but you have to include new workouts into your life ever week or so to see good results. i'm 16.. so i'm around your age. i'm 6 feet tall 206 pounds and 9 percent body fat... because i trick my body into thinking something is new by stopping one exercise for a little while and starting it up again later. also you have to eat breakfast it's truly the most important meal of the day. and every time you feel hungry you have to eat something small to keep your metabolism going. you should eat about 1000 calories before and after every workout or your muscles will become cannibalistic meaning your body will eat the muscle you work for as a source of energy... i'm a guy and i power lift so i eat about 12000 calories a day to build muscle... you should probably be eating about 4-6 thousand a day to lose weight. and if you add peanut butter into the equation you will see faster results provided you work out, because peanut butter turns into protein that your body will use to build muscle.<br>  when you do your ab workout make sure you include leg lifts, static holds and hanging crunches into it<br>  leg lifts- lay flat on the ground put your feet together and lift them 6 inches off the ground and hold it for 30-60 seconds<br>  static holds- get in your crunch position put one leg out and keep both legs off the ground put your arms straight out from your legs and hold that for as long as you can<br>  hanging crunches- i wouldn't recommend doing these alone until you gain experience and core strength. for now get a spotter to hold your legs. but hang from a bar by your knees and use just your ab strength to pull you up to your knees.<br>  and if you wan't to tone your legs get a rope and a weightlifting belt. tie the rope to the belt put the belt on and have somebody hold the rope... have the person holding your rope give you resistance and drag them as long as you can... i use a steel sled on an indoor track that i stack about 500 pounds onto and i walk for one mile. <br>  also try unconventional workouts like wood chopping, etc... i realize it's not the most feminine of things to do but it builds incredible ab strength|`|GvBtoKsqaa	"Contrary to what the infomercials suggest there is no such thing as spot reduction. Fat is lost throughout the body in a pattern dependent upon genetics, sex (hormones), and age. Overall body fat must be reduced to lose fat in any particular area. Although fat is lost or gained throughout the body it seems the first area to get fat, or the last area to become lean, is the midsection (in men and some women, especially after menopause) and hips and thighs (in women and few men). Sit-ups, crunches, leg-hip raises, leg raises, hip adduction, hip abduction, etc. will only exercise the muscles under the fat"<br>  <br>  In othe words.... just lower your body fat!!|`|FYUHJyvpaa	The ally of a flat stomach and a lightweight all year?

My advice to you is diet not like starving yourself kind but what you eat. If you exercise a lot but eat like a pig you'll get no where. So eat healthy stuff and make sure to eat breakfast. You can eat up to 5 times a day but don't eat a bunch each time. <br>  <br>  I'm trying to lose weight right now because last summer I gained 20 pounds and didn't do anything about it so this year I want to look good in the summer in a bathing suit.

(Don't be stupid and burn your mouth with a boiling drink)  Rub your face vigorously with your hands to get a flushed appearance.  Wear lots of layers of clothes (which will also raise your body temp. a bit) but say you feel cold.  that would be the symptom chills.  Say you are thirsty and want a hot cup of tea.  See to it that your temperature is taken right after a few sips of the hot tea.  You may have to be slick to have the tea out of sight before the thermometer, parents aren't stupid.<br>  <br>  Again, I don't approve.|`|1GUtq3Cnaa	You are unbelievable. Just go to school.

kpfMZ7Lyaa	I have learned that if you take everything one day at a time and only think about what you have to accomplish right now.

I'm worried you may just think ou have PCOS because you're hairy. that very well may not be the case. raise your concerns to your doctor and talk to THEM. there will be many tests you have to take and do that will determine the course of your treatment.|`|1KPUQMMxaa	i was told i would never be able to have children due to polistic ovaries|`|BRDqfAy3aa	discover below everything about PCOS|`|vl7QzwaFaa	I have poly cystic ovary syndrome.  My doctor put me on a birth control with a high estrogen level to make some of the cysts go away.  They told me they should go away in about six months, and if that doesn't work, I'd have a minor surgery.  They told me that fertility would be a problem for me in the near future, but it shouldn't be a problem in probably a year or so.  Talk to your doctor though...there definitely are options.
YCmvBc05aa	Receded gums (gingiva) can be restored with gingival grafts, provided you DO NOT have much bone loss. <br>  <br>  If you do not have the foundation (the bone), on what will the gum tissue rest ?<br>  <br>  On some rare occasions it is possible to do bone grafting on top of gingival grafting. <br>  <br>  The cost depends on how many areas / teeth have been affected.<br>  <br>  On an average for each site of bone grafting you will need ($300 - $450) and for gingival grafting ($850 - $1200).<br>  <br>  The actual fee depends on which practice you go to, their set fees and the expertise / experience of the Periodontist (Gum Specialist).
Y0r69m4zaa	Ok, first of all take a deep breath and let it out slowly.  Diabetes can be controlled and there are lots of things that can done to help you take better care of yourself.<br>  <br>  Some of them are:<br>  <br>  Exercising<br>  Understanding what foods to eat<br>  Natural supplements <br>  <br>  All of these can play an important role in managing your blood sugar and maintaining a long life.<br>  <br>  I have found a web site that has a lot of great information on it to help you understand about diabetes so you can make the best decisions for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|AA10744471	Three things to remember and religiously follow if you have diabetes:<br>  <br>  1. Diet<br>  2. Exercise<br>  3. Medication<br>  <br>  Consult your doctor for the details of the three. Actually, it is very simple to follow this regimen of diet, exercise and medication.<br>  By diet, you have to watch your food intake and follow the diet plan recommended by your dietitian or doctor. Exercise does not mean that you have to run many miles a day, but simply walking or yoga or philates would do. And medication is the most important especially if you are Type 1 because you need insulin everyday to control your blood sugar. For Type 11, you also need to monitor your sugar by taking oral pills. <br>  <br>  So, diet, exercise and medication are the keys to good diabetic control. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|k1zMsWxOaa	Hi<br>  I just want to let you know that a lot of the advice given is for type 2 diabetes, and has virtually no relevance to type 1 management.<br>  So if you are type one;<br>  <br>  -ignore anything to do with type 2 diabetes, they are separate diseases,<br>  -Check your BGL lots. its easy to forget but being aware is the easiest way to control it,<br>  -learn the serves in all the foods you eat,<br>  -learn about the disease, even many doctors don't know what is really going on, only listen to your specialist.<br>  <br>  with these you can start learning and gradually changing, but always carry your insulin and glucometer with you, you have to make it a habit to always have them, at first don't worry too much about what you are eating, as long as you know the serves and take the insulin.<br>  it needs to be part of eating, <br>  at first I had no  idea of the different serves, so all I ate was pasta until I learn the carbohydrate level of other foods.|`|cASB8Sh3aa	Diabetes is overwhelming so what can work is to write down all the things you want to accomplish.  Use what your doctor has told you to do to help you make the list.  Now take one goal off that list, like eating better, and break it down into little goals that you can work on.  For example, maybe you decide that you eat too much fast food, like 5 times a week.  Set a goal of eating at a fast food place only 1 a week and work towards that.  Once you accomplish that, you can either work to stop eating there once a week or pick another goal like eat vegetables 3 times a week and work on that.  This makes the goals easier to reach and gives you a sense of accomplishment.  Over time you will have made many good lifestyle changes and it wasn't that hard to do!|`|qxM8HCgSaa	People with diabetes can life happy like normal people, focus on survive and avoid complication, you will enjoy your life.<br>  avoid fat food, increase fibre include vegetable and fruit, burn your fat for treat recistensy insulin on your body by doing regularly exercise. take metformin as firsline teraphy for diabetes especially for overweight. don't eat before go to bed/sleep at night, cause acumulation fat/nutrition on body/under skin...not good for your healthy.  up your drink water......take more info, visit link below|`|MClFrDE1aa	Start by making diet changes. Avoid white foods (bread, rice, pasta, potatoes). These are high in refined carbohydrates which your body converts to sugar. Eat mainly green vegetables and fish. Walk 45 minutes a day.|`|szNFG66Laa	Drink a lot of water. If you are used to using sugar for different things, try splenda. It is the closest to tasting like sugar. excercise regularly , The more weight you lose, the better your chances of even not having to have to take medicine for that. My friend has type 2 but because of the changes that he had made, He looked so much healthier and he was able to wean off medication.|`|UgUKvfataa	I would talk to your doctor about this <br>  but no soda or well diet soda would help hardly any sweets medication would help.!
4pieE97Saa	The idea that it grows back faster and thicker is just a myth. People believe this because when you shave you cut off the top of the hair at the surface of the skin and the hair at the root is thicker so it appears so until the hair falls out and a new one replaces it. It appears to grow faster because when you have no hair you can notice it growing more than once it is visible.<br>  <br>  Its your hair on your face so do what you want with it, personally most girls prefer a shaven face and it looks scruffy and like you don't care about yourself when you don't shave at such a young age. In our boy scouts unit from about the age of 14 we abused the hell out of this kid who never shaved his facial hair.<br>  <br>  If you want a beard or moustache then wait a few years till you are fully developed and your facial hair is thicker and whatever you do with it will look good.|`|apA5Pcqeaa	well im 15 and I personally would shave it not to be laughed at in school because my school laughs at people that are underclassmen and have full beard or mustache. But, for me within only 2-3 days it grows back..it doest not grow back faster and thicker. when u get older yes..|`|gnIEDg6maa	How does it look?  Is it too thin or spotty?  If so, you have nothing to lose by shaving it.  It grows back fast but my personal opinion is that you should wait about a year before doing it again.  It makes some boys look older and it makes some boys look like a little kid with a fake mustache.  I think girls will like you better without it.|`|LJRyKC4Naa	Most of the time a moustache and beard on a 15 year old just looks weird. I'd advice you to shave it asap. Not to be mean or anything.|`|ssozOulnaa	i just turned 16 the other week and i have the same problam as you and yeah it grows back faster but its not that bad but mate shave it off they look stupid at our age lol

h0ypk4Dtaa	There are several causes for "chest pains", so it will be important for you to provide your physician with more details. It is important to know what the pain feels like, where it radiates to, what seems to bring it on, and what helps it feel better.<br>  There is costochondritis, which causes sternal chest pain due to inflamed muscles and cartilage around your breastbone (sternum). This pain gets worse when you push on your breastbone area.<br>  Angina, from the heart, will not go away if you hold your breath, and will not get worse if you push on your breastbone. The problem with angina in women, is that it presents very differently than in men. Angina tends to radiate into the neck and down the left arm or both arms. Most patients say that the pain is "crushing" like someone sitting on their chest.<br>  Pleuritis or pneumonia hurts worse when breathing deeply and goes away if you hold your breath.<br>  There are gastric and duodenal ulcers, as well as gallbladder pains that can be felt behind the breastbone, but are associated with food. Cholecystitis (gallbladder) will be worse after a fatty meal, and the pain is colicky. Many people will feel the pain radiate to the back toward the right shoulder blade. Duodenal ulcers feel better after eating. Gastric ulcers hurt when you eat and feel better 2-3 hours after.<br>  Any doubt, though, and it is definitely in your best interest to get to the ED. Hope you get this straightened out soon, and good luck!|`|cY0ZAA2uaa	GO TO A DOCTOR!|`|GcWRPLd6aa	depends what other symptoms she is experiencing, is this right after she exercised? after she ate? did it go away after she rested? is she short of breath? it could just be indigestion or heartburn, but it's something I would have her talk to the doctor about|`|lophd4T4aa	Is there any numbness in her arm?

You can't become a virgin once you have been penetrated. Doctors can tell if you have been raped recently.

(insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies. <br>  <br>  Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.<br>  <br>  Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	Hey Love - it's me again.<br>  Find what you are good at and do it over and over and over.

Believe it or not love...even at my age I battle the self esteem wall just like you do.  Life is full of choices so start making ones that make you happy.  Don't look for fulfillment in others.  Find what you like and enjoy and focus...become better at it.  I believe even at your age maybe you are being shaped to become someone who will eventually give her life to help others.  Whether it be in training dogs :) - okay I couldn't help myself - or in some other capacity like counseling, family therapy, nursing etc... You are a giver like me...when you give you feel just as good as the person you gave your time and energy to.  Some of us were meant to be servants...not door mats love, but servants.  To give of ourselves, to help others to grow and learn, and although they may even far surpass us in the worlds perspective (I encourage many.  Some are executives living the high profile life) but I have come to realize this:  I am fulfilled in being and accepting who I am.

9vBqgoDfaa	Why fight your natural insticts?<br>  Your brain has a natural instict: a fixating or dominant eye.

Wiwu7PUNaa	you can pretty much get "addicted"to anything.  maybe not physically, but mentally.  what you really need to look at is why you work out and stay away from junk food.  is it because you like how you feel after you work out or maybe you're trying to lose weight?  i know my friend had an eating disorder and HAD to work out a few hours a day and she ate way too little and only the healthiest foods.  needless to say, she really overdid it and working out and eating healthfully became a big problem.  so, it's important to find a good balance.|`|4vdtR7sSaa	my sister has to go on the tredmill atleast 30 min a day or she gets grumpy PLZ HELP WITH ME I THINK I MIGHT BE ANOREXIC OR SOMETHING!? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226180929AA7sdxi&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|rWoaRdljaa	i try not to eat junk, im pretty fit and i work out only on the weekends. i play football alot too. soo no im not addicted :P
jQZWO5VYaa	I haven't tried it myself, but I looked it up and it's a GABA (Gamma amino butyric acid) agonist. GABA is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter whose function is to depress certain brain functions. Therefore, GABA agonists (meaning they bind to GABA receptors and produce the same effects) are great for ailments such as anxiety or insomnia.<br>  <br>  I recommend taking 250-300 mg.

But just taking the first step – deciding to get treatment – can make all the difference.  Depression is not something you can just “snap out of”. It’s thought to be caused by an imbalance of brain chemicals, along with other factors. Like any serious medical condition, depression needs to be treated. Take charge of your depression, one step at a time. Definitely talking to a doctor is the best way to start. Take charge of your life and get on the right path.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Some possibilities:<br>  <br>  Borderline personality disorder (suspect this if there are tremendous fears of abandonment)<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder (suspect this if the person sleeps only say 2 hours a night for weeks at a time, but doesn't need more (not insomnia) then sleeps like 14 hours for weeks at a time, or longer)<br>  <br>  PTSD (could have been sexually or emotionally abused. google complex PTSD).<br>  <br>  Major depression<br>  <br>  Drug or alcohol abuse<br>  <br>  And you could have combos of these disorders, like the person has bipolar, and a sexual abuse history.  A person with the above symptoms has a good chance of being misdiagnosed, too, so any diagnosis, even by a psychiatrist, should be taken with a grain of salt. If treatment doesn't help after a few months, the diagnosis should be re-thought, in case it is wrong.<br>  <br>  PS also it could be side effects from prescription meds. Benzos (ativan, xanax, klonopin, valium) and the new sleep meds can cause paradoxical aggression or irritability and also can dis-inhibit people, so they may be much more suicidal.  This happened to me for years, and I was labelled borderline, or the docs said it was my bipolar disorder, but it was the ativan. my behavior isn't perfect, but is 90% better in the 5 years I have been off ativan (I was on it for about 10 years) antiseizure meds and other meds can be a problem for people.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	could be bipolar or major depression  also alot of stress can do it to you. seek professional help|`|vCvtOwgGaa	I am not a licensed psychiatrist but it sounds like this person could be bipolar or perhaps have borderline personality disorder.<br>  It is also possible to have both.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I think it is impossible for your husband to fully understand if he has not had depression before. My husband tries to understand my bipolar disorder, but he just can't. What I have done is have him come to therapy with me, so we can work on a team approach to handling the bipolar disorder. Also, it is possible your husband does want to be with you, and your depression is making you view everything negatively and so you think he doesn't want you - this happens to me all the time - because I have bipolar, I cycle in and out of this thinking so I know.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting a couple books from the library or a DVD or video on depression so he gets a basic understanding. You should also see a therapist, since meds PLUS therapy is far more effective than just meds.  Your hubby needs to be with you on this, since antidepressants cause severe sexual side effects, and that really impacts him (could this be one of the major problems and you guys don't talk about sex openly?)  When you see the therapist, bring your husband along some of the time, because depression is a disorder that impacts him, too. It REALLY helps.  I know my husband pipes up with useful info for the therapist sometimes, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZDdUSL2Naa	Your husband loves you and should understand that you need his support and love more than ever when you are feeling down. Anti-depressants just regulate you moods and only sometimes give you a constant level of happiness of some sort. Also different medication affects different people, if you feel they are not working as you think they should then maybe go backt to your doctor and ask him for a different kind. There are also some great homeopathic/herbal remedies that have been known to work quite well too(Im not too sure of the names of them though)<br>  Change in your diet and exercise can also help while you are on medication.<br>  Talk to your husband, Im am sure he will not think you are worthless. Let him know that you need reassurance that he still wants to be with you. I really hope you feel better soon! :)|`|AAMdfdZEaa	Depression is a disease.

AA12091376	It sounds like you have HPV genital warts.  If you also have Herpes, the Herpes outbreak will heal itself with time.  If the aldara isn't working fast enough for you, you can ask your doctor to freeze them off instead.  It hurts like crazy, but it is a faster alternative than using Aldara.  If you think you have Herpes, request a type specific blood test.  If it comes back positive, she will be able to give you a prescription for that as well.  Good luck!|`|mAp90hEeaa	Genital warts can spread like wildfire.  And, if your doctor says that is what they are, believe her.  Warts look much different that herpes so she probably did not make a mistake about this.  It sounds like the medication is working and, it may be making the virus that causes the warts to come to the surface so they can scab over.  Continue taking your medication as directed and hopefully, you will get this under control.  Then, in the future, cover up or you may soon add herpes to your health problems.|`|cY0ZAA2uaa	They will come and go.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|NOWPlaUXaa	Not to offend your current physician but you may want to have him refer you to a specialist or just get a second opinion.. you don't want this to continue if something is seriously wrong.. there's nothing wrong with a second opinion, especially from a professional.

My pain was getting worse as I was wearing the new shoes to go out everyday.<br>  <br>  In my case, I purchased "Dr. Scholls" brand insoles and cushions and placed them inside my shoes.  These magical pads really helped me to reduce the pain on my legs and angles.<br>  <br>  Don't you worry, the "Dr. Scholls" brand insoles and cushions are not expensive and they last for 3 to 6 months.  They worked so great for me. <br>  <br>  You can find this item in almost every pharmacy store.<br>  <br>  Now, you might want to check your shoes see if they have insoles or cushions in them.<br>  <br>  Another concern I can think of is your bed.  <br>  <br>  Recently, I had another painful experience caused by my old sagging mattress that really killed my spine and caused me lots of pain on arms and legs.<br>  <br>  If you are sleeping on an old sagging bed, that could cause lots of stress on your cervical and spine and this can create severe pain on your legs or arms as well.<br>  <br>  For my bed, I am switching over to sleep on a comfortable inexpensive airbed or air mattress that generates zero pressure on my body's pressure points and relaxing my muscle during my 8 hours sleep.<br>  <br>  After sleeping on the airbed just for over a week, my pain is almost completely gone.  Now, I am able to type and share my experience with others.<br>  <br>  You might want to try these inexpensive and gentle advice before spending lots of money to seek medical advice.<br>  <br>  I know in US, seeking medical assistance might involve expensive billing.<br>  <br>  I truly hope you will get better soon.
d17q3XdCaa	I have anemia (you spelled it right). The only symptoms I experience are 1) being tired alot 2) sleeping longer than usual.<br>  The real only way you can be sure if you are anemic is to go to the doctor so s/he can schedule a blood test for you.<br>  The test is no big deal if you don't mind needles. The doc may also prescribe iron for you too.<br>  Being anemic IS a VERY BIG deal. It means you are low on the blood cells that help fight off infection, virus and other bad things that attack our immune system.<br>  Go to the doctor!|`|WFohcXQPaa	If you are chronically anemic, you may not notice anything, because your body can compensate pretty well to cope with a low red cell count.  The best diagnosis is made with a complete blood count.  This can indicate what kind of anemia may be present and then this test could possibly lead the physician to order other tests, (i.e. iron studies, B12, folate, etc.) <br>  <br>  Anemia has to do with your red blood cells, not your white blood cells.  Please don't confuse the two.  <br>  <br>  Anemia is not a disease in and of itself, it is usually a symptom of other problems and this should be investigated to determine the root cause.|`|XhirXRkpaa	Fatigue, thin blood, easily bruising.|`|hNNkSgMKaa	One other sign is is the inside of your lower eyelid is white and not pink.|`|0f2194d257f43b166efad3e67b25890aaa	If you are anemic you need to see a doctor.  There are many different types of anemia and the treatment is not always the same.  I was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia in 2003.

I don't think tying a knot around it is going to do anything. If you must, go get some of those wart removal band aids at walmart. It worked for the wart on my finger. It looked really gross and you think it isn't working but after awhile it falls right off. It was kinda gross but fascinating. lol It left a small scar for a little while but it is completely gone now.|`|zrKuaiDLaa	I think that's just a myth...<br>  I hope this answered your question!|`|mAp90hEeaa	That would probably make the top of the wart fall off but warts have a deep core that goes beneath the skin and that is why they keep coming back.  You can ask your doctor to freeze it off or you can buy one of the freeze off kits and do it yourself.  But, you have to wait until it is healed and then freeze it again as the core comes up towards the surface in order to completely get rid of the wart.  Wart removal is often a long process which can take weeks before they are completely gone.|`|87pV5lvZaa	Tying a string around a wart will not remove it.  Warts have filament-like "roots" that extend under the skin.  Even if the top of the wart fell off, it would simply grow back--and possibly even larger.<br>  <br>  Why not go to a doctor and have them removed?  If you're concerned about the pain, I'll bet he/she could give you lidocaine beforehand.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  That does sound like an annoying problem...|`|JBuNJJbkaa	I wouldn't, I have a huge wart too, on My knee cap. I went to Walgreen's and bought some simple Dr. Scholls wart remover that contains Salicylic acid, and I've been using it for 2 weeks now. My wart is almost gone.

That's wat I do for basketball.<br>  =)|`|924d3783b5ac5e06329d0bedc1d478e4aa	if you can't go to the doc & have it removed,  I suggest you wear a cover-up.|`|YMKNOUZTaa	I don't really know about genital warts.  Tying it off doesn't sound like a good idea.  Whenever I get a wart on my hand or see someone else who has one, I suggest duct tape.  Cut off a little piece, and stick it to the wart.  There's (supposedly) some kind of chemical in the adhesive that gets rid of warts.  Not sure if this would work on genital warts though.  Try asking your doctor if he knows about any alternative medicine that can be used safely with your other medical issues.|`|JSKBqjVMaa	Hmm not sure...I think (if you have one) you should buy some wart remover
qnD5RfbPaa	I assume you are referring to hot peppers otherwise referred to as chili.  Red chilis contain high amounts of vitamin C and carotene ("provitamin A"). Yellow and especially green chilis (which are essentially unripe fruit) contain a considerably lower amount of both substances. In addition, peppers are a good source of most B vitamins, and vitamin B6 in particular. They are very high in potassium and high in magnesium and iron. Their high vitamin C content can also substantially increase the uptake of non-heme iron from other ingredients in a meal, such as beans and grains.<br>  <br>  Red chili peppers, such as cayenne, have been shown to reduce blood cholesterol, triglyceride levels, and platelet aggregation, while increasing the body's ability to dissolve fibrin, a substance integral to the formation of blood clots. Cultures where hot pepper is used liberally have a much lower rate of heart attack, stroke and pulmonary embolism. <br>  <br>  Peppers boost immune system, help stop prostate cancer, and prevent stomach ulcer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_pepper" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_peppe...</a> will give you some of the medical use and some posible health benefit of peppers.|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	its not too bad unless u have heart or lung problems|`|OddewIzoaa	the reason why people like pepper (and other spices) so much might be explained by human history of adaptation. people realized that plants produced some antimicrobial chemicals and incorporating these plants into food can be beneficial. And thus it might have been adaptive for people to use spices in cooking to protect themselves from contaminated foods.<br>  So pepper is good for you, as is any other spice. Salt is a completely different category.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I've been told spicy things can be bad for you digestive system.  I eat loads of spicy stuff, but it seriously jacks with my digestion.<br>  <br>  I don't know if it caused it, but when I was 23 I got colon polyps.

ae3e1d351362ce2aa8644626c2d77f9caa	When we have a baby as indeed when we have our monthlys our hormones are all upset and thrown out of balance, this plays hell with our emotions. You say that it has changed as you used to be fine, this is probably because of your pregnancy. Pregnancy does strange things to our bodies and our feelings and tastes buds, i know lots of women that could not eat certain things before they had their babies and now their tastes have totally changed and they can tolerate and some even prefer things that they used to hate. Do not worry, there is nothing wrong with you, it is just that your emotional state has changed because of your hormones, you can get something for it, or you can try and deal with it by understanding it, expecting it and accepting it, all you have to do is know that as soon as you get through these few days, you will be fine again till next time.

Anything is possible.  There could be more growth potentail ahead for you yet.  If not, then you must accept what God blesses you with & get on with the rest of your life.  You can trim pubic hair anytime you get ready.  Shaving is a pain in the patoot.  Risk of razor burn plus the mad itching when it sprouts back.  Keeping it trimmed short & neat is best.|`|udpdCqQ2aa	Whenever you want.. some people are born with the hormone to have a small penis.. guys don't start maturing untill thyr 26 years old.. so don't worry..<br>  <br>  AND just for the record... girls don't like anything over 6" b/c anything bigger would destroy a tight lil vag! :)|`|apA5Pcqeaa	go to a doctor. im 15 and i have a bigger size..maybe you just started puberty late or will end later. idk dont be afraid to go to the doctor|`|4WWVsABqaa	shave all of your hair offf, hairs a turnoff and it will make your dick look bigger. im serious it really will!|`|YDttUxrnaa	just shave mines 18inch:)|`|aDBQncYuaa	First and foremost, NOTHING is wrong. Just like some people are tall and some people are short, some penises are tall, and some are short. I can't speak intelligently about when penises stop growing, and I expect that few people can. Mine stopped when I was about 15-16.<br>  <br>  Shaving is not just for gay guys (contrary to what has been said), but I would advise against it. A shaved johnson can be very appealing to some girls, but when it grows back, it itches like nothing you would ever want to feel again. Get yourself a beard trimmer, and make sure you attach one of the clips (you don't want to get bit by those teeth). As far as when you should start, that's entirely up to you. I'd suggest you do it before you have any sexual contact. I've yet to meet a girl that was into the barricaded forest look.<br>  <br>  Try the website below for the size issues. It's far more reliable information than you are going to get from Yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Added note*** The post before mine by Demi is actually kinda accurate. Shaving will make it appear larger.|`|ElDjqr2Iaa	I started measuring at the age of 12, i was like 5.5 inches. I think your small, or a very late bloomer, I got to be around 8, idk, i didn't grow much in puberty, on average by the end of puberty you double ur size, so if u wanna know your size end, just try to remember what it was when u were just beginning puberty, double it. I started puberty at age 13, i got cheated. You know they say those who take longer to develope get bigger because they have more time. So maybe you'll be 10 inches when ur 25, who knows?|`|baFb0HPoaa	Um...You can shave it any time you like, it doesn't matter but most people including myself would say trim it. Anyway as for the small size, it usually continues to grow until you are in your early twenties.|`|92T6OdWBaa	Yeah shave it off.

SltEwVX7aa	You're maturing, both physically and mentally.<br>  <br>  Yeah, girls think about sex all the time.  Well, a lot of the time.  <br>  <br>  And yeah, you probably like this guy a lot.  And wanting to have sex (in a passionate way) is a pretty normal feeling.  At the basic level of being an animal (and we are) you're programmed to seek out a mate with traits you would like in your children.  When that mate is found, the 'need to breed' kicks in.  Socially, we as humans have 'rules' to deal with this basic program.<br>  <br>  Chalk up first guy as a learning experience.  He wasn't the one.  That's why you didn't have those same feelings.  But, you're also older, and have matured physically and socially and mentally.  So, that also plays into the feelings you're having.<br>  <br>  You sound like a perfectly normal person to me.  <br>  <br>  I'll offer this final thought:  You're first time, most likely, won't be "passionate".

776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	It's probably just a cold virus.  Sounds like he has some sinus congestion and/or drainage that is making him nauseous and curbing his appetite.  Tell him to take an over-the-counter nasal decongestant with a pain reliever like Tylenol Cold and see if he feels better.  Make sure he's getting plenty to drink.  He won't die if he doesn't eat much for a few days, but it's crucial that someone with a fever says hydrated.  He should call the doctor if he doesn't feel better in about 5 days or if the fever is over 101F.  <br>  <br>  There is a small chance that he has a more sever illness.  Ask your friend if it hurts when he tries to touch his chin to his chest.  If he says yes, tell him to call an ambulance.  Fever and bad headaches are symptoms of bacterial meningitis.  This is an extremely dangerous infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal column.  People who have this condition need large doses of antibiotics right away.  Serious damage to the nervous system can occur in a very short period of time.  <br>  <br>  There is also a chance that your friend has viral meningitis, which is not nearly as dangerous, but still requires medical attention.  Symptoms are similar to those of bacterial meningitis, though usually less severe.  Viral meningitis is not usually life-threatening. <br>  <br>  You seem very nice to be so concerned about your friend.

R3WAqTCHaa	I'm sorry to be the bearer of the bad news but sweet heart, I think you have caught genital warts. Don't freak out, because almost everyone gets this virus at one point in their lifetime. In fact, 25% of sexually active adults have it right this minute. It's not something you want to have, but it's something that is not uncommon. And it's not the end of the world. You need to get some cream, it's called Aldara and your doctor can perscribe it to you. Applying this cream will make the warts fall off within a few weeks. The fact that it bled so bad and is not a pimple means it's probably HPV warts. Especially since you are getting them in these places. The good news is, they are easy to treat. But it sucks, because they come back from time to time & itch a little
PAvYZJK2aa	it is normal|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Yeah - you're normal, kid.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Well since your scar is fairly new it might be pink for a while.

WFohcXQPaa	Actually they are harvesting the stem cells and using them as a cord blood transplant for certain blood diseases.  One advantage of a cord blood harvest is its ease of harvest (no danger or complications to the donor).  Another advantage that has been found is due to the young age of these cells, they may only need 3 HLA match's, rather than 5 or 6 as in bone marrows.<br>  These can be frozen and saved for a later time when needed.  A disadvantage is the small number of cells available compared to a bone marrow transplant, so when a cord blood transplant is needed (when a bone marrow match may not be found), they can actually use two cord bloods, even of different blood types, and one blood type will eventually win out and establish itself within the recipient.
6wKW0urqaa	see a dermatologist.
VFku3949aa	Im no Dr. Phil but I think its a natural defense mode that you have. It maybe a bit odd but effective. You simply laugh at the very thing trying to cause harm to you. You know its been said that laughter is the best medicine. You're just taking a huge hit of antidote when ever the mean and nasties come around, be proud of that.|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	It may be different, but in a way you are lucky. It is better to laugh, as this is a natural healing method than to bottle things up and cry. Your body goes into a defence mode which in your case is laughter. My sister is like that or at least she used to be like that. She laughed like a horse. Unfortunately, people criticised her so badly and she did not take that well. Now she takes pleasure in living like a hermit which is very sad. <br>  <br>  Maybe, if you feel the need to respond, you can ask the people that are unkind, why they say such things. If you feel the need for clarification. I would recommend, keep laughing. A friend of mine says, every morning he looks in the mirror he sees God! What a wonderful way to deal with your low self-esteem, if he has any! LOL|`|2eee3d9288232f099e9b265f904ce90aaa	Some people's brains confuse pain with pleasure. It's not normal.

NOWPlaUXaa	Cut down calorie intake at each meal.. not so much that you wouldn't get the vitamins and nutrients your body needs from the food itself, but enough to help burn off enough calories to meet your goal.  I heard it was safe to lose like 3 lbs in one week.. don't quote me on that though.  Try being active also (walking, jogging, stretching is AWESOME, cardio) anything that gets your heart pumpin'.  It's probably realistic but it depends on how determined you are to stick to your eating plan and exercise regimen.  Good luck!  I think it's possible.|`|84a3f58bab9b254359c6da5c7fb80c7caa	Realistically? No. Not saying it's impossible. I've lost 11 lbs in 2 weeks- not in any healthy means, but it happens.  Also depends on how much you have to lose to begin with. I have a lot- 10 lbs isn't much in comparison. But if you only have 10-15 lbs to lose, it'll be more difficult.<br>  <br>  Losing pounds of fat is simple math- you need to burn more calories than you consume. You need to have a calorie deficit of 3500 calories to burn a pound of fat. So losing 10 lbs is 35,000 calories burned (above and beyond what you eat).<br>  <br>  To lose one pound per week is to burn 3500 calories per week or 500 calories per day. <br>  <br>  To burn 2 lbs per week is burning 1000 calories per day.  <br>  <br>  To burn 3 lbs per week is about 1500 calories per day.  <br>  <br>  You would need to burn just over 3 lbs a week to achieve your goal. Based on the numbers above is that realistic to do so while not starving yourself?<br>  <br>  Probably not. This is individual to your metabolism and activity level, but for a female of around 5'4" weighing 125 lbs 1500 calories is about how many calories per day the person needs to maintain their body. So, creating a deficit of 1500 calories would require an insane amount of exercise, or essentially so much dietary restriction that person is starving. <br>  <br>  Also- trying to burn too many calories per day can make your body think your starving even if you're eating 2000 and burning 3500 (a calorie deficit of 1500) in a day. The body will down regulate the metabolism to try and ration calories it does get, and it'll become more difficult to burn off those unwanted pounds.  This is why extreme diets usually work great the first few weeks and then not much or at all after that.  Also why people who use them often gain all the weight back and often more.<br>  <br>  A safe and steady goal is 1-2 lbs per week.

1BbnyTfBaa	If you can, work out the genealogy of your family so that you know how many women who you are genetically related to had breast cancer, not just the ones who died from it.  Remember that if your relationship is by marriage, it does not affect you.  For those that you are related to, find out how old they were when they first got breast cancer.  Breast cancer before age 40 is unusual, but it does run in some families.<br>  <br>  I used to work in a mammography research project.  Young women's breasts are very dense.  A denser breast requires more radiation to make an image.  If you have large breasts, the problem is greater because there is more tissue there.  It is possible that the doctor determined that an image of your breasts would not be clear enough to be read by the radiologist.  <br>  <br>  I suggest that you ask your doctor, "I have a strong family history of breast cancer and pain in my breasts.  It seems to me  that I might have breast cancer.  Why don't you want to give me a mammogram?"  You are entitled to an explanation that you can understand, even if they are not charging you anything.<br>  <br>  If image quality is an issue, call around to find a facility that gives digital mammograms.  They give a clearer image with less radiation.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you get a second opinion from another doctor before you give up on this.  However, at your age, it is unlikely that you have cancer, unless young onset cancer runs in your family.<br>  <br>  Check out medical genealogy:<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=medical+genealogy" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=medical+g...</a>|`|9QVzSMT8aa	Did the doctor perform a breast exam on you?  If not--go back and demand that they at least do a manual breast exam.  Mammograms are great--but sometimes small lumps cannot be seen on mammograms.  A knowledgeable and experienced doctor can detect small lumps from early cancer through a manual exam.|`|MaPPHhbqaa	go to another doctor, and they say that breast cancer doesn't have pain.

That's the good news. When they say they "won't" do a mammogram, that basically means insurance won't cover it as a preventative measure. However, if you or your doctor were to find a lump, they would most definitely do a mammogram. Your doctor has no reason to do a mammogram at your age since she has no reason to believe you have breast cancer. I know it's frustrating and you're nervous. I can understand that. I'm 27 and my aunt recently had breast cancer (thankfully she is in remission). Regardless of family history, your chances of getting breast cancer at 26 are extremely low. Continue doing self breast exams and if you find anything suspicious, call your doctor and investigate further. If she still refuses to do anything, seek a second opinion. Good luck.

ZHJuK1QNaa	Melissa- Believe me I feel your pain. I have migraines everyday, and have had them for thirty years.  I have been to many different pain clinics all over the country.  Finally they came to the conclusion it was genetics, (my Dad and brother have them daily as well) and there was nothing they could do but treat the symptoms.  That may not be the case with you. Many people do find cures for their headaches. <br>  <br>  First you may be able to pin point the cause yourself.  Keep a detailed journal; keeping track of your activities and what you ate prior to the onset of you migraine. Avoid aged cheese, caffeine, alcohol and processed foods; like lunch meats or hot dogs. You may find that your migraines are linked to hormones, so make sure you keep track of your menstrual cycle in your journal. By keeping a journal your doctor can better help you figure out the cause, and the best treatment.<br>  <br>  I can tell you if you panic, your pain will intensify.  I know you are panicking because you know  what is coming, try your best to control that. Next it is better to move yourself to someplace dark and quiet. I've found placing an ice bag on both my forehead as well as the back of my neck, helps some.   It is very important that you take your pain medication at the FIRST SIGN of your headache, other wise it may not work.  But, pain management can be tricky!  If you take pain medication too often, it can cause re-bound headaches, then you find yourself in a never ending cycle.<br>  <br>  Start your journal and see a doctor as soon as you can. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps!|`|Whh0G1eJaa	Excedrin actually contains Tylenol, and it does help some folks.

Be normal and hopeful to get rid from this skin condition. Stress is a major reason behind increase in Psoriasis.<br>  5) Smoking is not better specially for the patients of psoriasis.

In a lot of cases psoriasis is preceded by an illness however l <br>  doubt if l will ever meet a sufferer of psoriasis whom won't prove to <br>  be a coeliac (intolerant to gluten). It is interesting to note that a <br>  high number of hepatitis C. sufferers go on to having psoriasis (not <br>  that means you have HCV) but you do have an Autoimmune malfunction. <br>  That's what should be considered the mystery why has your Autoimmune <br>  failed you and not the formation of psoriasis. It is so simple to put <br>  to test, theres two ways the first l don't recommend buy some Calcium <br>  Ascorbate (Vitamin C) take some at recommended doses then eat some <br>  french fries or potato chips. Watch your psoriasis flare up. The other <br>  way l do recommend is to avoid processed foods that contain Citric <br>  Acid, Food Acid (food addictive code 330) Ascorbic Acid Acid (300), <br>  Calcium Ascorbate (302). which is in over 90% of processed foods, soft <br>  drinks, winesetc. Simply stop feeding your psoriasis by eating what is <br>  natural foods. <br>  The term 'Calcium Protease' is the name they have in medicine for psoriasis. Why is it called that? Say we took a sample of your flakes and revert the flakes back to plasma (TPA) Then took a sample of your normal skin, the difference in calcium levels between the two is obvious. The flakes have a content of calcium many times of what the normal skin has. Hence the term 'Calcium Protease'  So easy again to check just type the words <br>  in your google search bar <br>  l don't know how many testimonials l have, l don't count nor do l wish <br>  to make any money out of people who are suffering. As l have been <br>  through the pain of having Psoriasis to 60% body and to top that <br>  psoriatic arthritis, been through all the crap for the want of a <br>  better word as far as the medicals go. <br>  The first thing you will notice the itch goes, the flakes start <br>  dropping off, no more of those sharp agonizing pains of arthritis. <br>  Just a dull ache for a while when the lows in weather pass by, but <br>  that too passes. Those that have tried <br>  my recommended diet can't thank me enough, so make my day just by <br>  saying thank you. It's free, all l ask that you tell others….. <br>  http//pia500.multiply.com

VbuiwZBoaa	I've tried, and used it regularly, and despite it being a gateway drug, I would never, ever use anything other than marijuana because compared to pot, look how much worse other drugs are. I believe pot isn't that bad; it's not addictive like other drugs and cigarettes.|`|Cp06GyiQaa	nearly every second person!! i have and wouldnt again!|`|ph4psSwNaa	not me|`|6gapssLfaa	Yea I have and I'm not about to go try any other drugs.

VtqdeSQ8aa	I've tried all kinds and the Mega-T green tea & hoodia works as well, better I think, than the more expensive ones. It's only about $6.00.|`|NK9Qc46Paa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	they all basically have a bunch of caffeine in them and cause you to be jittery and anxious. short term you may lose, but long term they won't take or keep the weight off.<br>  <br>  The best option is lifestyle modification diet and exercise|`|FoDOp7nWaa	green tea diet pills work but they are expensive
qnD5RfbPaa	When I start getting daily headaches it is usually that either I'm not drinking enough water - 8 - 10 glasses per day.<br>  I am constipated - not have a bowel action for more than 48 hours.<br>  I'm stressed - need to relax and sleep.<br>  Or I have not been getting enough sleep - 8 hours per 24 hour day.<br>  <br>  If you are having a bowel problem the best way to resolve it is to start eating at least one meal of raw toss salads per day and drink at least 8 glasses of water each day.  Shredded cabbage in your toss salad is especially good to free your bowel.  Having varied amount of fruits as a meal is also good to keep your bowel free.  The fiber from these raw fruits and raw vegetables along with the water creates bulk and lubrication for you intestinal tract, which result in a free bowel.  Potassium from ripe bananas is also recommended  for the health of your intestinal tract. <br>  <br>  There are other reasons that can cause head aches. Reasons such as sinus problems, viral infection, bumping your head etc.<br>  <br>  Starting now, drink water every hour up until bed time.  You will urinate frequently - that is o.k.  From the moment you awake from your sleep in the morning, start drinking water again - every hour.  By the end of the day your headache should subside or completely gone if it is as a result of dehydration.  If you are not getting 8 hours of sleep try making up for it.  That might be what your body needs.|`|ebr7nKG8aa	go to a doctor.|`|mP8ILrC4aa	hey i'm in ohio and married to a moroccan...something in common....you should im me<br>  also i have had headaches all my life and they suck, i find that i get it worse at night so when i wake up in the morning its a lot worse<br>  is your worse at night when sleeping or is it worse before you sleep<br>  drinking lots of water helps and also loosening your muscles with stretching...lots of headaches are muscle related....really it depends where your headahce is and how bad it is. you might need to go see a doctor if its continuing or if its super bad|`|YG288fG4aa	It could be becuase of the weather depending where you live, which can cause sinus headache
4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	You can't reliably tell, unless someone tells you. :/<br>  <br>  Yes, some people have handwriting changes, changes in voice and all that, but more often than not, people who are multiple will do everything in their power to make sure others can't tell.<br>  <br>  Let it also be known that DID and MPD are /not/ the same thing. MPD assumes that someone who has had severe trauma has 'split' into one or more 'alters', that alters cannot know about one another on their own, and that such a thing is always a horrible, disordered and evil mental illness. DID is different in that it assumes the person doesn't even really have 'alters', the person just made it up to deal with the trauma and is simply delusional. The DID model isn't even really used outside of the United States.<br>  <br>  Also, let it be known that multiplicity... having more than one person in one body... is NOT the same as MPD or DID, and is not always some mental issue created by trauma. It doesn't have to be a disorder. There are plenty of multiples out there who reject the MPD and DID models, who are happy, healthy and functional. <br>  <br>  I have provided links below for people who wish to learn about healthy multiplicity. It is real, it's not as uncommon as people think, and as far as we can tell it seems that, in many cases, it's natural.|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	The modern term for it is Disassociated Identity Disorder (DID)<br>  Some symptoms include:<br>  Loss of memory<br>  Knowing something one day and not knowing it later on<br>  Personality changes<br>  Hearing voices and having the ability to connect with or talk to them (as opposed to schizophrenia, where the voices cannot be reasoned with)<br>  Answers to different names<br>  Unreasonable mood changes<br>  Changes in the way the person talks (accent, language, or style or speech)<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, these symptoms could be found in other disorders. <br>  <br>  Many people with DID live very normal lives and have adjusted to the disorder. There are more people with DID than most people know because people tend to think of the extreme cases (like Sybil, who could not adjust in society) and not know that their neighbor or even a sibling could have the disorder. Because of this lack of information, people tend to fear the thought that someone with DID could be delivering their mail or teaching their kids. <br>  Most of us do not announce our disorder to those around us to avoid unfounded prejudice. There are more than 20 of me, but most people know me as one person. One person who acts a little different sometimes, but one person just the same.|`|9dc691a36025146c808e9a4bac64e207aa	the different personalities will have different handwriting,voices and gestures from each other. one personality may not be aware of people that another one knows. memories  will be different as well. the host personality may not even be aware of all of the others. there will be periods of blackout due to another personality being present. appointments missed,bank accounts can get really screwed up when one takes out money and the other one doesn't know it.|`|8787fd72b997bdc823d2393ce85ec0c9aa	it's dissociative identity disorder, actually.

xWGJHMkuaa	A penis|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Kelli<br>  Your hand held shower message, a electric tooth brush, a clean cucumber.|`|vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!<br>  <br>  As for ways to do it, you have several options:<br>  <br>  1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!<br>  <br>  2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!<br>  <br>  3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).<br>  <br>  Above all else, have fun!|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	slide under the faucet in the tub and let the water hit your u know where spot :) and spread out your legs|`|R1uFA7nKaa	End of a hair brush.

AA10744471	It could be a good sign, but moderation is the key to exercise. Do not overdo it, and since you say it is a light ab workout then proceed slowly and stop when soreness or pain follow.

MlojB0FWaa	hey i have the same thing this is what my doctor told me:<br>  -Sleeping on the left side has been shown to reduce nighttime reflux episodes in patients, also elevating the head of bed is an effective therapy<br>  -Coffee, alcohol, and excessive amounts of Vitamin C supplements stimulate gastric acid secretion. Taking these before bedtime especially can cause evening reflux<br>  -Eating within 2-3 hours before bedtime<br>  - try not having Large meals. Having smaller, more frequent meals reduces GERD risk, as it means there is less food in the stomach at any one time.<br>  <br>  I HOPE I HELPED!!! IF YOU NEED MORE INFO JUST IM ME!<br>  (the girl above me doesnt know anything because all that info is on wikipedia.com<br>  i rember this from reading it along time ago)|`|9d3ce70fe723c76264a9f283d685bce2aa	If your acid reflux is that bad and you are young, you should defininitely see a doctor for it! It might be something other than acid reflux, or their could be a way they could help you or fix it!<br>  <br>  Have you tried not eating certain foods that cause acid reflex? Soda, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, peppermint, brocolli & cabbages, tomatoes, citrus fruits, foods high in fat (fried food!) all can cause acid reflux. Maybe you could try only eating very small meals (but like 5 or 6 a day instead of 3) How about over the counter drugs? Tums, alka-seltzer, pepto bismol?<br>  <br>  Also, I guess that bad posture can cause gastric reflux because it blocks the path from the esophagus and stomach, so if you have bad posture, maybe work on it.<br>  <br>  Well.. good luck. You can have a lot of fun staying home if you have to, get a really good new book or movie, have a spa day (face mask, paint nails/toes, sugar scrub, bath with candles, etc.)|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	There a few things you can do, but this is what I have heard for this problem more than once.

If your goal is to lose weight, then do cardio (you're less tired).  Opposite is true if your goal is to build muscle, but remember to do a warm up set first.|`|XQJg3RNTaa	weight training ALWAYS, after a run you'll have nothing left to burn during a lift and you won't be able to make any progress.<br>  Lifting first raises your heart rate but not as much as running does, keeping this heart rate elevated  after lifting with running will increase the amount of energy you burn by satisfying an energy equation relating the magnitude of your heartrate and the time you keep it up.<br>  <br>  Basically it doesn't really matter, it's the same amount of energy either way. But would you rather run with sore muscles or lift completely out of energy and breath? I think it would be much more productive to lift first.|`|YcN07uFvaa	weights then cardio because of the different fuel sources your body uses . weight training uses mainly stored carbohydrates. after 20 min of exercise you start using fat as a fuel. cardio uses mainly fat. by doing weights first you will burn more fat for fuel and do it sooner in the cardio portion of your routine.<br>  <br>  doing cardio first will use up too much stored carbs and your lifts will be weak.|`|CcYYbzSdaa	The pattern for losing weight is easy - consume less food and exercise more often - the issues arise when we really try to put that into operation! There are lots of temptations in the real world don't you think?!

It is a very strong deodorant, but you put it on at night and it seals your sweat glands nearly shut.  It is safe for hands, but make sure you use it once or twice to test it out, and not every night, and be sure not to touch your face/ eyes until the next morning, after you wash your hands.  It should work.
muHmWCzhaa	you just need to suck on the skin but also bit it just a bit so that it doesnt hurt and open your mouth more on the skin to give a bigger one....the bitting bit is just to make the skin have more blood on it like a deeper color of red like not faint and will last longer...<br>  <br>  also while your doing it just enjoying dont be concentrating just enjoy it and relax|`|TBaf74bfaa	you just suck up a huge part of her skin for a really long time.I do it a lot|`|k4Ek3jAqaa	suck extremely hard and bite her like a lil Asian monkey lol|`|xbedCzcraa	What you do is put your mouth against the side of their neck, in a kissing shape. You leave your mouth slightly open in the middle, like you're saying the letter "O". Now you suck in! You suck the skin into your mouth, in essence hurting it, and causing the blood vessels to break. This turns that circular area bright red. It doesn't take long, maybe 30 seconds.<br>  Also when you suck, you could bite a little. And if you want it to be a bigger one, then just open your mouth wider and suck in more skin. :]|`|bo4MguzVaa	you just suck and the blood comes up to the skin
Rx31LHjbaa	Nope.  Blood is blood.  It doesn't matter what part of the body it comes from.  When you get your period, you shed the lining of the uterus also, so this can cause the blood to be thicker and darker, and sometimes sort of clumpy.  It also takes some time for the blood to pass out of the uterus and down the vagina, so it's not really fresh blood.|`|cf958f585e81f35dda5c9e48e6f15eb2aa	It's the same blood just from a different location. The reason it may seem different is due to the fact that it has been stored in the lining of the uterus. And most of the time those aren't clots they are the lining of the uterus itself shedding when you have a menstrual flow.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	no, but it tends to have clots come out with the blood|`|f2KRMmMJaa	All the blood in your body is the same. Just the only thing different with menstrual blood is the fact that there is the regular vaginal fluid mixed in, and sometimes there are blood clots.

I did all kinds of exercising. I just moved & was high from this. My kids would follow me as I ran around in a circle in my living room & then I would yell "change" & we would run in the other direction. It was great. I highly recommend you do this.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	Cool Pic!!  I love it!!  <br>  <br>  So, sounds like mom is right... but...<br>  <br>  instead of heat, have you tried icing?  Sometimes icing is much better for back injuries.  Give it a try if you haven't.<br>  <br>  Also, are you stretching especially on off days???  You know how important this is.  And when you are stretching, you have to make sure you suck in your belly to make your core stronger.  People with chronic back pain use that exact procedure to keep their core stronger so that their back hurts less.  <br>  <br>  Since the chiro was no help, have you had the chance to check out massage therapy?  It is extremely helpful for tender overworked muscles.  Think of all the pro athletes that use it everyday.  A simple rubdown can make a world of difference.  Also, acupuncture will help out tremendously.  Don't take too much Advil as it will eventually wreck your liver - mom can educate you on that.  So, stay the holistic route as long as you can.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Keep playing ball and all the sports you want.  You look awesome out there and you should be so very proud of your accomplishments.  Don't stop doing what you like to do until a doctor tells you to stop.  Stop playing if you want to, but not because of pain.  Try everything you can before giving up.  Besides - you could end up making a great career out of being a pro or semi pro female QB someday!!<br>  <br>  P.S.  X-Rays might not be a bad idea, but I have a feeling an MRI might be a better idea.<br>  Good Luck!!|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You should see a chiropractor. That's what I did and I feel a million times better.

I now wear this belt the majority of the day and I have felt an amazing difference and I also wear it after my adjustments at the chiropractor and it seems to help a lot.

If that is what you are upset about- the best advice that I can give you is live your life the best you can, be close to your loved ones and just be happy with whatever time you have on Earth. No one knows when it will end and I think that you should read the bible from beginning to end. Only God above knows when it will end because he will be the one and only one that will end it when he is ready and no one knows when that will happen.

NgmxbMePaa	That acid you are talking about is something called lactic acid. Basically, what happens is that when you run, you're constantly bringing in oxygen (you know that already). Depending on how fast you run determines how much oxygen you need. There's a specific point called the lactic threshold where its the maximum speed you can run without going into what is usually called 'oxygen debt.' Oxygen debt is basically working so hard that your muscles don't get the amount of oxygen it needs, and through a couple rather boring body processes your body releases lactic acid, which is the main cause for that burning you feel (especially when you don't warm down enough and don't stretch after a run. <br>  <br>  Now, the point of that above is mainly to state that your body needs oxygen as fast as it can get when you are taking part in extreme exercise, like sprinting or the like. A lot of people say that the best way to get this oxygen is through your nose. Actually, they are wrong.  Breathing through your nose actually lets in oxygen slower than breathing through your mouth. The main reason is that breathing through your nose purifies the air and stops foreign stuff from getting inside your lungs, which is great when you're laying on the couch or doing light exercise, but it is not the best way of getting oxygen into your  system during heavy exercise, since you need as much oxygen as you can get as fast as you can get it (try this- try taking a deep breath as fast as you can through your nose, and then try it through your mouth. It should be easier to breathe through your mouth). When you are doing heavy exercise, breathing through your nose is going to put you into more 'oxygen debt' than breathing through your mouth, and will therefore build up more of that lactic acid, which again, is what causes the cramps or soreness or that burning. So actually, breathing through your nose should make it burn even more. <br>  <br>  Basically, what I'm trying to say is that the burning is caused by an acid that is released when you are not getting enough oxygen to your muscles. Breathing through your nose is not as efficient as breathing through your mouth to get that oxygen there, and therefore breathing through your mouth is the way to go. <br>  <br>  Although breathing through your mouth is much more efficient than breathing through your nose, I'm not saying that you still won't get those burning feelings in your muscles. What helps is that after hard workouts, try warming down and stretching. Warming down helps to 'flush' out the lactic acid better than just doing nothing. Think of your muscles like a pool by a sandy beach with lactic acid as sand and people being the intensity of the exercise, and the water itself as blood. The more people that come to a pool with sand on them, the more sand that will build up in the pool. Same with muscles. The more intense the workout, the more lactic acid (sand) will be left in the muscles (the pool). Now, going back to the pool story, if you do nothing, the sand just stays there. Similar to running. If you don't do anything after a workout, the lactic acid stays there and the burning will continue on. But if you circulate the pool somehow, you get rid of that sand. Similar to a warm down. If you warm down and stretch, you are forcing more blood to those muscles, taking away that 'sand' (lactic acid) from the 'pool' (your muscles). I know this analogy may seem a little strange, and if you want me to clarify I'd be happy to. <br>  <br>  In one short sentence, don't breathe through your nose during workouts, and always warm down and stretch after a run.<br>  <br>  I hope my kinda lengthy explanation is actually understandable. I'd be happy to clarify anything, just let me know.|`|UYaWH7a0aa	It helps because you have a much more controlled stream of oxygen entering your body. It is most recommended that you breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth when running (and doing most other exercises as well)|`|s3cvyLYtaa	i also heard that breathing through your nose helps but i don't know why|`|9d3ce70fe723c76264a9f283d685bce2aa	learning a proper breathing technique through your nose instead of panting with your mouth open I think is what helps<br>  <br>  You need to learn to take deep, even breaths. Expand your lungs all the way! <br>  <br>  Breathing through your nose helps to warm the air more and filter it.  <br>  <br>  There is no way to totally avoid the burning feeling after exercise, unless you only do very moderate exercise.  I imagine that stretching before/after, and the next day and proper breathing techniques will help though.

The cramps and discharge are whats called ovulation and you get it usually 2 weeks before your period. This is when you are most fertile so if I were you I wouldnt have any unprotected sex around this time, or any time really for that matter!

qnD5RfbPaa	Since he has seen the doctor on several occasions, I will assume it is not angina.  It could then be that his pH is a little off balance.  Give him mostly raw vegetables to eat at least 50% of his total daily meals.  By vegetables I mean cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tomato, carrot, parsley, celery, brusel's sprouts etc.  He also need to have lots of raw fruits - at least 20% of his total daily meals.  Take him off all rice for a while.  He should have solid foods such as pumpkin, yam, potato, cassava (cassada, yuca, manioc, mogo or mandioca), dasheen, green banana, plantain, breadfruit etc.<br>  Encourage him to chew his food properly before swallowing.  This will ensure that saliva is properly mixed in with his food.<br>  His protein should be a variation of meats, eggs, milk, and other dairy products, fish and other sea foods, nuts and seeds.<br>  <br>  He should be having a vary wide variety of foods - raw fruits, vegetables, proteins and starches and his meals should be varied.

You probably won't have heavy duty medical bills (unless you ignore that last part). I don't know what to tell you about your other bills. I'm assuming you don't have sick leave?|`|z0torDIWaa	Yes, that sounds like the symtoms of mono, unfortunately.  I have never experienced this but a girl in a few of my classes had mono and I was nervous becuase I got sick (although it was bronchitis) anyway I looked up the symtoms and those sound about it. I would say stay away from coughing and physical contact (e.g. kissing, hugging, etc..) other people becuase it is EXTREMELY contagious.  I would say get some bedrest until the tests come in, but that sounds like you have mono.  The good news is that symptoms may not appear 2-4 weeks after you have been infected with the sickness and are contagious for 3 or 4 weeks. This means that you may have already had it for up to 4 weeks and are in the last stages. In 1-2 weeks you may still feel these symtoms, at a minimum level, but be able to return to work due to the fact that it will not be contagious any more.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and get well soon!|`|jziyTfLZaa	Mono?

It sounds like your crappy marriage either needs the help of a marriage counselor, or a separation.<br>  Those are my honest thoughts.

BRDqfAy3aa	check below - everything about missed periods|`|InI33juraa	no its not too early..if your late but 3 weeks after intercourse could give u an incorrect result.. you should have a blood test done just to be sure! i conceived my son around February 28th and took a test on March 19th and it came back positive.

7ff91aea1d5f9f19f507ddbc78ae0251aa	ok what you are going to do is deffintly not going to help you. the point of eating health and working out is to be health and look good. to start your "diet" is not adiquit you need to eat small healthy meals throughout the day. this may be hard considering you go to school but it is not impossable eat things like a granola bar between classes or things like that. another thing is 2 hours chained together is no good. 2 hours is longer than you think what you should do is sets of things like crunches, sit ups, stuff like that (do about five sets of three diffrent exercises about 25- 30 reps each set to start off). then beacuse you want to be proportional ( i dont think you want to be slim on the bottom and fat on the top) lift light weights for a high number of reps. do things like curles, chest flys and lap pull downs.( most gyms have machines with lables that say what exersise it is now so you dont have to worry about free weight). finally go ride the stationary bike for 7-10 miles this will help the thunder thighs and such and will give you the cardio you need to lose the weight you want. It is possable to lose the weight but you have to want to the entire time and push yourself. another good thing to do is to have your parents set up a time for you to meet with a physical trainer  you can tell them your goals and they can show you what will work best for you. as far as the streach marks they may go away with time but i dont think there is anything to get rid of them especialy for 10 dollars. hope this helps|`|PizXrl2oaa	Yes you definitely can if you stick with it.  Stop drinking soda and replace it with water.  Drink LOTS of water every day.  When you feel hungry try drinking a glass of water and waiting 5 minutes to see if you're still hungry.  (only do that when you've eaten recently and shouldnt be hungry)  Many people are dehydrated and don't know it.  You get to where you can't tell the difference between being hungry and thirsty.  Eat 5 small, healthy meals a day.  Eat protein, veggies, and fruits daily.  Exercise 3-5 times a week for at least 30 minutes.  It can be anything that gets your heart rate up (walking, jogging, dancing, hula hoop, etc)<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what to do for stretch marks.. I think they make lotion for those.|`|qnukgFYzaa	ya. be dedicated to the work out. situps and push ups|`|mQ0wxEBFaa	I've had similar goals and just saying it isn't gonna change anything, you gotta get out and do it!  To lose that much in 4 months would be quite hard but possible I think, you gotta be dedicated though.  Starting right away is key, don't say you'll start when you get back, start now! <br>  <br>  Now for food..salad is good but use a low-fat or no fat dressing, because dressing has a lot of fat in it.  You also need to add more fruits&veggies to  this diet because you will soon get sick of living on salad.  Try brown rice, clementines (good for the skin), oranges & bananas (go light on the bananas though).  I would also try fat-free yoghurts, they're delicious and only 35 calories, I eat about 2-3 a day.  Water is a definite good choice because it helps in weight loss. <br>  <br>  For getting rid of the excess fat an exercise routine will immensely help as well.  I would recommend joining a gym asap or jogging outside everyday for 30-60 mins, 6 days a week, you need a day to relax and 2 hours is a little much.  I say to join a gym because you can use other machines other than jogging such as elliptical and cycling.  Idk about stretch marks but they might disappear with the weight loss.<br>  <br>  All I can say now is good luck and keep motivated!  Think about all the clothes and swimsuits you can wear in the summer and think about that everytime you want more bad foods.

OST33XFNaa	All antibiotic treatment courses should be followed by the use of probiotics to repopulate the intestinal flora.  Probiotic use during antibiotic use will just expose the probiotic to the inhibiting/killing effects of the antibiotic.  So save yourself some money and use the probiotic after you're done with the antibiotic treatment.<br>  <br>  For a good probiotic, you want a product that can get the bacteria to survive the stomach and make it into the intestines.  It really doesn't matter how many millions or billions of cfu (colony forming units) a probiotic has if there is no way to protect them from the digestive juices of the stomach.  This is why probiotics should always be taken on an empty stomach (to reduce the amount of time it spends there) with at least 8oz of water (to dilute stomach acids).  <br>  <br>  I personally like Floracol from Generation Plus.  Floracol does not require refrigeration and remains active because the product is in a suspended state.  It is only activated by the proper pH and moisture in the body.<br>  <br>  Yours in Health & Wellness,<br>  <br>  Hiroyuki Nakamura<br>  Licensed Acupuncturist<br>  www.healthyonpurpose.com|`|yE2vM76naa	Basically, ALL of them....<br>  Taken them after the course of antibiotics.<br>  Some people suggest taking them with - however, depending on theantibiotic, your probiotic might be killed off by the antibiotic - so why chance wasting perfectly good money. Actually, you could ask your pharmacist - its a question he should be able to answer regarding the drug you are taking...<br>  <br>  If for a a woman, take one that is a little heavier in lactobacillus acidophilius(to prevent girlie issues), and if a man, take one that has a little more bifidus biffidum (to prevent intestinal issues) (those are the names of the bacteria strains)  Most places sell probiotics that are blends of bacteria found in the intestinal and urogential tract. I suggest blends over isolated strains. And I like to take at least 5 million per capsule if possible, a couple times a day, for at least a couple weeks afterwards

xM4CumQoaa	you only bleed the first couple times. it shouldnt continue after 3|`|kAfZaLwraa	And you're sure it wasn't your period the first time? Bleeding that long is not good. <br>  <br>  You bleed because your hymen, which is a thin layer of skin covering the opening of your vagina, tears when you have sex. Usually it only happens the first time, but I guess it's possible that yours only tore partway and then stretched. Go to the gynecologist and get it checked. If your hymen is still intact, you can get them to snip it for you (which will hurt, but not as bad as having it stretch and tear slowly apart while you're having sex). <br>  <br>  Also, what happens when you cut yourself shaving? Does it stop bleeding quickly, or does it take a long time? If you bleed for a long time whenever you bleed, go talk to the doctor pronto because you might have a clotting disorder. <br>  <br>  Anyway, here's a list of things that have been known to cause bleeding after sex. Check them out, look at the symptoms, and see if any match. Then get thee to a doctor!|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Bleeding during the first time is normal.

58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	If you just started taking the pill, you'll need to be on it awhile before it's okay to have sex without a condom.  Read the instructions that come with your pills - for my particular brand, it was 2 weeks.  If you've been on the pill for awhile, what everyone else said is correct - the pill is just as effective one day as it is the next, so there really is no "best time" as long as you've been taking your pills as instructed. Some pills are supposed to be taken at the same time everyday...not following those instructions can cause the pill to be less effective.  As long as you've been following the instructions closely and not missed any pills, any time is a good time to have sex without a condom.|`|Md07JyI7aa	I'm assuming you mean in order to avoid pregnancy, in which case:<br>  <br>  The period comes because an egg fails to get fertilised. The period comes about 12 to 14 days after the egg is produced. Therefore, in the average 28 day cycle the egg is produced around day 14. Sperms can live happily 48 hours in the vagina or the uterus so the most fertile time is day 12 to day 16.<br>  <br>  The least likely time to conceive is from day one to day seven. If your cycle is different from 28 days on average you have to adjust the calculations - the important thing to remember is that the egg is produced about 14 days BEFORE the next period starts - so there's always a bit of guess work involved.|`|d5kt46e5aa	I would say right after your period ends.

gjKqBJwKaa	well... Apendicitis in old people is a very hard diagnostic because they do not feel the pain as an adult do, I guess it was diagnosed either with MRI, TAC, or Ultrasound. <br>  <br>  Anyhow the apendicits per-se is not really bad, the problem comes if it bursts, then the contents of the colon go into the abdomen and cause a peritonitis, that if not treated might be fatal.<br>  <br>  However there are scales that doctors use to see how much of a a candidate someone is for an operation, thinking that you GP has no diabetes, heart problems, etc, it's a risky operation, however if he has associated problems, well it's not risky, it could mean a certain death.<br>  <br>  I think that if you can go and visit him, leave your 5yo with a sitter and talk to him, hopefully not but it might be one of your last chances to do it.
BMGEi0yCaa	I'm a bad pill taker, too; mostly because I have some strange phobia about swallowing pills. I always get scared that I'm going to choke. Anyway, Tylenol offers their pain meds in liquid form. It costs a little more than regular pills, but it works just as good for me. As far as I know, it only comes in 1 flavor right now - Cherry. But it's not that bad and it goes down very easy. You can get this Tylenol pretty much anywhere you can get pain meds, but I've found that the cheapest place to get it is Walmart. If you can't get to Walmart, you're guaranteed to find it at CVS or Walgreens (or any other similar convenience store).<br>  <br>  Also, in conjunction with the Tylenol, try getting a heating pad. You can get this almost anywhere, too. Lay down on the couch or your bed and get comfortable. Set the heating pad a low and place it on your lower stomach. That should help ease the cramping a little. Just try not to fall asleep with the heating pad on as they have been known to cause burns.<br>  <br>  If neither of those work, try getting some Midol and crush it up until it's almost powdery. Scoop up all the pieces and swallow it quickly with some water. It'll probably taste gross, but it should help.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|X1TeqHcxaa	Try these sites.|`|qSP1cRgOaa	Period cramp is a common problem for many ladies.<br>  <br>  Such problem also affects me just about every month.  <br>  <br>  Recently, I stopped taking any pain relief pills and tried out another approach.<br>  <br>  Two to three weeks before my period begins, I would intake a multi-vitamin bill ( any brand) and an Omega-3 (fish oil) pill daily.  These are safe supplements that you can find in every pharmacy store.<br>  <br>  The result was amazing, I don't have any period cramp anymore.  I could do anything even during the heavy flow days ( ususally the first three days of my period commencement).<br>  <br>  In the past, when my period began, I had to stay on my bed since the painful cramp hurt my stomach so much and disabled me to walk normally.  <br>  <br>  This advice is inexpensive and absolutely safe.  Even if it does not work for you, the multi-vitamin and Omega3 pills cannot damage your health unless you eat overdose.
QQRyi4Bgaa	A Hernia reduced my sleep hours and as the day progressed protruded more and more. It was quite uncomfortable and caused me anxiety as it seemed to worsen with time.<br>  I researched the problem online and came upon Indian Health Guru Consultant’s website. I wanted the procedure as soon as possible. The staff at the surgical facility were so competent and kind I was astounded. The procedure was done on time, quickly and efficiently and with great kindness and dignity. The total time was les than 20 minutes. I had minimal pain during the first eight hours and none thereafter. There was virtually no bleeding, scab or scarring. I flew 1000 miles two days after the surgery and spent a few days sightseeing and visiting with my son. Seven days after the procedure I want back to full work. I have functioned normally since then with no effects from the operation except the relief from the discomfort, anxiety and risk of the hernia. Fourteen days after the surgery I ran three miles and used weights at the gym, including squats.<br>  I am so grateful to Indian Health Guru Consultant’s treatment and care. I would never hesitate for a moment to recommend for professional services of Indian Health Guru Consultant’s. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indianhealthguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianhealthguru.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA10500537	$12.000 to $15,000 or  possibly more <br>  you could go get medicaid .<br>  you know a hernia and  burst or strangle you dont let it go,<br>  besides the hospital can;t refuse you treatment

You burn waaay less calories when you're sleeping so that food is more likely to get converted to fat. <br>  <br>  But exercise does increase your appetite, so I don't necessarily think it's anything to be worried about.

5d0506fe6f86fded69f53c9e28c5f779aa	I just got fitted for Invisalign for both my top and bottom teeth. It is costing me $5,000 total. I paid $2,200 up front and will be paying $200 a month for 14 months once the treatment begins (200 x 14 = 2800). The payments will be autodrafted from my credit card. So, it is $5000 total before insurance is applied.

Ask your parents to take you to the doctor.  With medication and therapy, you can get rid of these.  And, you need to stop worrying about your health because this anxiety is contributing to your panic attacks.  Most teens do not have time to even think about their health - they are too busy.  Maybe you need to enroll in more activities to keep your mind off yourself.  Or, you can start an exercise program because warm muscles secrete serotonin which is the "feel good" chemical in the body.  Walking is easiest - work up to 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace.  You'll be amazed at how much better you will feel when doing this and how little time then you have thinking about yourself and your health.|`|WZBSYpI9aa	You can take medicine for it, if nessacary.

AA10551261	"The most common testicular pain in adolescent males is termed “ blue balls.” This is not a medical entity nor is “blue balls” a medical word.

In another year you will be old enough to see the doctor without mom present.  So hang in there.  As for not having the Doctor touching you it is something that we cannot avoid in our life.

FaVYRoXqaa	Yes and no.  <br>  <br>  Your body uses the carbs the same way, and if you overate the same amount of twinkies and potatoes, you have the same chance of gaining weight.<br>  <br>  However, in refined carbs (the twinkie), the sugar is essentially released all at once, giving the average person a sugar rush.

Most years infections can be cured with OTC meds, like monistat.|`|VUV8oXEHaa	no darling :)<br>  iv had a yeast infection (also known as thrush) 3 times now<br>  <br>  itl just cure the itch<br>  <br>  you see a yeast infection is up in the vagina so you cant use any creams that arent intendid inside<br>  <br>  i used canestin 2 in 1 (now there a lots of these so get the right one)<br>  it contained cream for the outside<br>  and a pesery type thing for the inside<br>  now the pesery is a tube type thing that you stick inside your vagina and push like a syringe to let the cream out<br>  you only do this once<br>  and do it at night and wear a pad cause it comes out<br>  the next morning have a shower or bath to wash the gunk of<br>  <br>  then carry on using the external cream for about a week that will get rid of it<br>  <br>  trust me iv had thrush about 3 times and currentl have it now<br>  <br>  they do cost alot aswell<br>  good luck <3|`|HWYzREAIaa	Yes, I do believe it does. It usually comes with a cream to stop itching, but the "pill" you insert is what fights the yeast infection. It should work. :)|`|96Frq9uUaa	It should get rid of it and relieve some of the itching
S8H5yYcoaa	It's possible that your birth control is making your periods so light they seem nonexistant... if they've been getting lighter each month, that's maybe what's going on.  There's nothing medically dangerous about not menstruating, but if you like that monthly assurance your bc is working, you should talk to your doctor about switching to another type (probably one with more hormones, but they'll know more about that than I).<br>  <br>  If they'd been pretty steady though and just suddenly got lighter, it's probably not your bc affecting your period.  That said, it doesn't mean you're pregnant.  Stress, either physical or emotional, can affect and even completely stop your menstruation: this is why anorexics and atheletes often experience lighter and/or fewer periods, the body just doesn't feel fertile enough to support a fetus so it stops the cycle before it begins.  Of course I'm just some random person on the internet, and so cannot diagnose you, while any pharmacy-purchased pregnancy test can be a lot more accurate a reassurance if you're seriously concerned that you're pregnant.  But if you've been semi-sick for months now, that sounds emotionally and physically stressful... I definitely have experienced late and lighter periods due to big exams in school or breakups, so you definitely could just be under enough stress that your body decides to reserve its resources just for you for now.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	yes, they regulate your hormones.|`|HWYzREAIaa	This is completely normal. The birth control regulates your hormones which can lead to a change in periods. Usually they are a lot lighter and shorter while on birth control. taking other medications (such as antibiotics) while on birth control pills can also fluctuate your periods. But it is completely normal :]|`|wbuG0efyaa	That is normal usually the longer you stay on the bill the better it regulates your hormones and also the longer your on it your periods get lighter|`|bYoGeKUUaa	yeahh, they can
KAnEq8Laaa	Major congratulations on your weight loss!<br>  <br>  Atkins, for many reasons, is not a healthy plan at all; it's a good thing you're switching to a different philosophy. That aside, I am curious as to how you lost the first 55 pounds--you lost a LOT of weight doing that, and, even though you hit a plateau, what works, works. I have done a lot of research on plateaus, as well, and this is what works for me: the Atkins "interval" you've been on can be regarded in the light of a "break" from your old plan. Sometimes, when we hit a plateau, the body needs to kind of "reboot" itself. There are a number of ways of doing this: calorie "cycling" (eating varying amounts of calories over the course of a week), switching exercise routines, and so on. So call the Atkins your "break," and just ease, over the course of a week or two, into counting your calories. Make sure you are eating enough, though--working out for 9 hours a week is an awful lot, and if you don't eat enough calories, your weight loss will stop since your body is trying to prevent starvation. Make sure you have access to a good BMI calculator and a good calorie-tracker--these are available free online at about.com. No, going off of the Atkins, and onto a much more sensible plan, will not cause you to gain a bunch of weight back; if anything, you may see some small fluctuation in water weight, but it's important to know that it's NOT fat, and not to freak out about it. Your body will need to adjust to the change--hence, the "easing-in" period. Then you will begin to see your weight loss happen again. <br>  <br>  Also, you may want to re-evaluate your goal: if the number on the scale is more important to you than the fact that you are, right now, most likely pretty cut, you may want to rethink those last few pounds. If you do, however, still have a bit of flab to work off, just remember this: losing weight, getting in shape, and maintaining that condition are not start-and-stop propositions. It takes a long time, and sometimes, if we try to hurry things along, we get stumped. So be patient, keep up the good work, and don't buy the hype when people say, you can lose 20 pounds in two weeks! Because you probably can't. <br>  <br>  Great job, and major congratulations are due to you! Good luck!

OST33XFNaa	Cayenne might help, but I would think that the help would only be temporary.  Additionally, cayenne being a spice, it may heat your body even more and cause your heart rate to go even higher.<br>  <br>  From an acupuncture standpoint, cold extremities are typically due to blood stagnation in the abdominal region.  Meridians such as the liver, spleen, or conception meridian may be involved.  If you haven't given acupuncture a try, I highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  Another way to go is using Protefood from Standard Process.  Circulation at the extremities may be impaired due to inefficient protein utilization in the blood.  Inefficient protein utilization can occur when some amino acids are not present, thus leading to a build up of other amino acids which thickens the blood.  This can easily happen since most of us do not consume raw protein.  Cooking can denature proteins and lifestyle choices (ie vegetarian) are two ways in which we don't get all the essential amino acids we need.<br>  <br>  Protefood has all the essential amino acids as well as RNA to assist in protein utilization.  I personally found the product to be very helpful at warming my extremities and all my patients who have used it continue to use it.<br>  <br>  Yours in Health & Wellness,<br>  <br>  Hiroyuki Nakamura<br>  Licensed Acupuncturist<br>  www.healthyonpurpose.com|`|Aiv3Wc5Saa	try powdered cayenne (the seasoning) and sprinkle a little in your socks/gloves. The capsicum oil draws your blood to the surface of your skin and helps increase circulation. But be careful, too much will burn.|`|gAuIixm6aa	How would that work? Please include some science in your answer.<br>  The coldness in you extremities has to do with circulation and blood pressure. I recommend tiny adhesive hand and foot warmers from the army surplus store.

There are other things that can show up on xrays as well but nothing for you to worry about.   <br>  <br>  Yes xrays can "see" bones but what it is really doing is showing dense areas.  Bones, tumors, foreign objects and thick mucus will show up, just to name a few.
6uQh4VSpaa	That actually sounds exactly like depression.  Most people who are depressed feel worthless or guilty, and feeling like you're failing the people you love is very common.  My advice is to try to remind him of all the things he does that make you happy.  He probably feels like he doesn't deserve you, or that he's screwing up the one good thing in his life.<br>  <br>  It's not easy to be in a relationship with someone who's depressed, but don't lose sight of the good things you like about him.  If he's not seeing a doctor about it, encourage him to.
AVDAKbnvaa	you should never take expired medication|`|flKkoiwbaa	It's never a good idea to use expired medications.  At best, the active ingredients (that is, the medication) has degraded and will no longer help relieve your cough.<br>  <br>  At worst, the medication has degraded to a potentially toxic metabolite (this is more common with antibiotics, but can happen with other meds as well).  Also, the syrup base of the cough medicine is perishable, and can provide a suitable environment for bacteria to grow, especially if the medication was not refrigerated. <br>  <br>  There is a real and valid reason that medications have an expiration date!.

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	The most common option used as homemade teeth whitening agent is baking soda, which has a mild bleaching action. Given that it is used in baking, it also implies safety. Baking soda is sprinkled on the toothbrush, and teeth then cleaned using a gentle, circular motion. Care should still be taken though, especially for people with gum sensitivity. Old wives’ recipes often state that a paste of baking powder, a little salt, and a few drops of white vinegar, works effectively.<br>  <br>  Salt, used exactly as baking soda, is also touted as being a good teeth whitener. However, it might just be its osmosis, dehydrating action that makes teeth appear whiter, since dehydrated teeth look whiter. <br>  <br>  Lemon juice is often used, but it had high acidic levels, so teeth can weaken in the long run. Other natural, fruit options regard rubbing the inside of an orange peel on the teeth. A strawberry cut in half and the inside rubbed on teeth also works. Mashed strawberry can also be applied with a toothbrush. Apple cider vinegar is also said to be effective. Dried orange rind, and walnut bark, is also good.<br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>|`|aCN1SS8Taa	Hi guys….<br>  do you want to have white teeth ??<br>   I have site reference about dental whitening and I hope it helps you.<br>  There offer you dental whitening, you get it free for first time.<br>  This patented dental whitening system begins washing away coffee, tea and other hard-to-remove stains after only one use.

CJeufMTWaa	I did not develop cancer, but I did develop precancerous cells due to HPV.  I had to get a LEEP procedure to cut out the bad cells.  I had this done a little over 2 years ago and have been free of any problems ever since.  If you have HPV it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you have Pap smears at least every six months if not more to monitor any abnormal cell activity.  If you do not keep getting checkups then you could miss abnormal paps that would prevent you from developing cancer.  You should immediately make an appointment to get checked out.  It is not worth the risk of getting cancer and possibly having to get a hysterectomy and losing fertility or even your life.  If you get regular, frequent checkups then you can keep yourself safe.  If your doctor finds precancerous or cancerous cells then you may need a LEEP procedure.  Under sedation, this procedure is painless.  Don't wait.  Make an appointment now!
PsWlCWUCaa	You should go see your doctor immediately especially if you have vision problems. I am a type 2 diabetic and a few months ago I had problems with my vision.

sxS98sxJaa	Actually you should eat large amounts of healthy foods! Fruits and Veggies of course and up your protein from good, healthy resources. Stay with low fats, not necessarily no fats, and low to no sugar foods. Jumping roping is a start but you should research other types of exercising and pay attention mostly to cardio. Your heart rate needs to be up and steady for at least a half an hour to burn any calories whatsoever. Head to a gym and check out what it takes to get your heart rate up because its different per weight and age and gender for everyone. Drinking a lot of water is great as well, but cut out drinking while you eat and a half an hour after so you will stay fuller longer and your body has a chance to absorb all the nutrients. Make sure you try to eat every two hours. A good healthy breakfast to jump start your day, a snack (fruit or veggies), a good healthy lunch, another snack, a good healthy dinner and then a snack afterward. Keep fuel in your body at all times. Also, do some research. Try this website: 50millionpounds.com<br>  <br>  They give great advice. An account is free and they even give you a weekly meal planner and grocery list! Hope this helps!|`|Lj0eT5n2aa	sure! but be sure to make sure ur eating!

JcwjDpY8aa	NO<br>  they do not work.  I have tried several kinds even one that was 100.00 from GNC, and I have had many friends try them.  They DONT work.  I have always followed the instructions to the t and no luck.<br>  Your best bet is DEFINITELY to purchase fake urine or use a friend's childs urine or one of your parents.  It needs to be contained in something clean , possibly a syringe with no needle in the end and with something to completely make it leak proof.  I have used this and put it inside a zip lock bag and hidden it in the seat of my pants.<br>  You will DEFINITELY need something to make the urine at LEAST 96 degrees.  It wont register if it is much lower than this, and they know it isnt yours.  "Glove warmers" are sold for about $1.00 at walmart in the sporting goods area, they are inserted into a hunters gloves when it is very cold outside.  You need to wrap them around the contained urine for a couple hours before the test, wrap the whole thing in a washcloth or something so it doesnt get too hot against your skin. You also will need to bring a thermometer so that you can make sure the urine is your body temp.  If it is too hot, just wait a couple minutes until it has cooled down in the cup.<br>  <br>  *edit* if you use someone else's, you need to find out exactly what medicine they have taken in the past couple of weeks such as birth control, ibuprofen, psych meds, etc.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	it depends on how much you smoke but if you really only smoked twice and it has been a month before that since you smoked then you will probably be ok, just drink alot of water and you are supposed to drink the detox drink a couple hours before you take the test|`|e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	Good chance you may not :)<br>  <br>  Stop smoking weed is the only solution I'm afraid.
USsDzaIsaa	There are a few ways to know if someone is a virgin.<br>  <br>  1) you can ask them.<br>  2) if you've seen them having sex with someone there's a fair chance they're not a virgin.<br>  <br>  Anything else is mere conjecture.<br>  <br>  Your question suggests to me that you are too young to be asking these sorts of things on the internet.  Go do your homework!<br>  <br>  Huggy: Virgins can have semen present in their vaginas.  It is quite possible to have semen in one's vagina without having had a penis inside it!<br>  <br>  They can also have children either by IVF programs or turkey baster insemination.  Of course in usual practice these women have tried for children the "natural way", but it's not 100% proof of loss of virginity.<br>  <br>  There are NO STDs that can ONLY be caught from sexual intercourse. Digital penetration can cause infections to be passed between couples.  In this instance the female would still be classed as a virgin.<br>  <br>  Also, as an aside, women who have had children via caesarean section have vulvas and vaginas that are similar in appearance to women who have not had any children.<br>  <br>  The ONLY thing that proves loss of virginity is sexual intercourse itself.  Not presence of semen, not childbirth.  SEX ONLY.|`|77NzfiVkaa	That is really stupid. There is no way to tell if someone is a virgin, not even by their hymen.

BVtnCy1vaa	Try a heat pack to relieve pain, go to the doctor because although some people can get really bad cramps naturally it could be something serious. Like an ovarian cyst.<br>  <br>  If you go on the pill it can relieve period pain but you might not like putting all those extra unnatural hormones into your body. However most people still eat chicken.<br>  <br>  Just go to a real doctor, have a scan and you can see what's wrong.<br>  <br>  No seriously, go to one.

YRJShhKraa	It sounds like you might have lactose intolerance, but you should go to an allergy doctor just to make sure that you don't have an allergy to milk first. Try eliminating all dairy products from your diet for a few days and see if you feel better. If you feel better then you are probably lactose intolerant. I have found that taking a fast acting lactase caplet with my first bit of dairy product to eliminate most of my symptoms. They don't work for everyone but they are worth a try. Also there are a lot of good soy and other dairy free products out there now a days. Hope this helps! =)|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Everyone is lactose intolerant within the first 3 years of their lives.  The idea that we're supposed to be suckling off a cow our whole lives is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  No, you can't outgrow it.  Yes, you definitely are intolerant.  You shouldn't be ingesting anything that leaves you that bloated and sick.<br>  <br>  You can get calcium from yams, moreso than milk.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Yes, it can come and go.  It's just a lack of the enzyme to break down the sugar (lactose) in milk.  If that is the problem, you just need to take a lactaid (or similar) supplement before eating anything with milk in it.   It's really not that terrible.<br>  <br>  If it's an actual milk allergy, that's a whole different thing.<br>  <br>  But neither has anything to do with absorbing calcium or Vitamin D.

G1OSlub8aa	If your going to get anything from bowflex, get the selectec dumbbells (free weights up to 90lbs) and a bench off of craigslist. I would stay away from the actual machines as there is no eccentric resistance with it and the initial weight that comes with it is a joke (it states it is 210 lbs but feels more like around 90 lbs). It is also very expensive and takes up a bit of room in the home.|`|Lz7wRvZcaa	what you need is a gym pass and try it out for a few months before committing to such a purchase.  And ask your physician about it.  And don't be afraid to ask questions and follow exercise routines on the posters of the gym.  I would suggest you try free weights as they are (at least I think) the best way to pump iron.|`|MccqAZSNaa	No. They are way too expensive and with a properly designed workout regimen, you can get the same results with a simple weight bench and some free weights or a gym membership. I don't recommend it. Bowflex is overrated.|`|jpVFYgHraa	man i was thinking the same thing... just get a gym membership if it is possible... bowflex is for people who know what kind of workouts to do... start out with a trainer... i ruined my wrist thinking i could learn it by myself....|`|rSnqTx4Eaa	my husband used to work for Fed Ex in a location where a Bowflex company was based & he said that he unloaded more returned (unsatisfied customers') bowflexes that he could keep track of in a day.  I would see if there is a local gym that doesn't require a long term contract and try that instead (they have machines very similar to the Bowflex that you can try out).|`|tIldpr7vaa	i would suggest just getting  a weight bench and a good selection of free weights instead, theyre cheaper and more effective, and dont take up any more room.

xEGRedDBaa	Ingrown hairs my friend. Next time don't shave the hair all away, use a trimmer instead. The bumps are the hairs trying to poke back through the skin. The pores that the hair grows through is closing up to some degree and when the hair starts to get longer again it tries to poke back through the skin, which makes its itchy and gives the red bumps affect. <br>  <br>  So next time try to trim, not shave.<br>  <a href="http://tomwalt.com/category/family-health-care/" rel="nofollow">http://tomwalt.com/category/family-healt...</a>|`|iGZWeWwBaa	?

It sounded like early stages herpes at first but for most people with herpes those will go away after the first year or two. <br>     My best guess is that you are probably prone to ingrown hairs. One thing you should keep in mind is that you may be looking for these. I had a phase where i would constantly look for ingrown hairs on my legs because i would notice them. After a while i noticed them everywhere and after while of trying to get all of them out my legs looked like ****. I got over the phase and i get them from time to time but i have to stop myself from delving into that appetite for finding ingrown hairs and getting them out. It might just be your little form of ocd. Try not to let it bug you so much.

AA11785060	Could just ask him, he probably has all the answers. But it is called undescended testicles, and the balls are supposed to drop into the scrotum from inside the abdomen at or around birth. So if the pediatrician notices they have not dropped and can't move them down manually he will have surgery arranged to pop them out of their cavities where they developed and into the scrotum.  Need to be dropped down before puberty, otherwise the testicles will not develop properly and can be serious-- as well as any ball undescended is generally infertile. Not an issue if the guy had his taken care of as a child. They should be just fine.  You may hear teens say their balls have dropped-- stupid idea since they did so at birth in most cases.|`|AA11522944	Undescended testicle, called cryptorchidism, refers to a testicle that fails to move into the scrotum. This is a condition that is present at birth.<br>  <br>  The primary treatment for this condition is surgery. Often, a child is watched until the age of one to see if the testicle will move into the scrotum by itself. If not, affected testicles can be brought down into the scrotum using surgery. Surgery improves cosmetic appearance and makes examination of the testicles to check for cancer easier. Surgery may also improve the chance of future fertility in some cases.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below<br>  <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/undescended-testicle/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.allhealth.com.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?nav_top_id=4&id=4&art_id=22770&nav_cat_id=205&history=2&cr=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.allhealth.com.au/html/s02_art...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageContent.asp?pageCode=AZUNDESCENDED" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageCo...</a>
IKakoOfyaa	Having undescended testicles isn't all that rare, really. The surgery is called orchiopexy.  With one undescended testicle, fertility isn't impaired.  Those who've had two undescended testicles may be more likely to experience diminished fertility as adults.

Or do you lie, just for the sake of the lie itself.  I think you need to speak to a counselor,  about why you lie.  Maybe a few sessions with a therapist will help.

Penis enlargement exercises is the only way that really does work.<br>  <br>  There are 2 chambers (the Corpora Cavernosa) inside the penis which fill with blood when you get an erection. Penis size is limited by the amount of blood that these chambers can hold. The only scientific way to get a bigger penis is to increase the amount of blood these chambers can hold – more blood in means a bigger erect penis.<br>  <br>  The only method which can do this is enlargement exercises. These work by driving blood into the chambers (using your hands) and so gradually expanding them. By consistently doing the exercises for a few minutes every day, it is possible to get a longer and thicker penis.<br>  <br>  You do need to know how to do the exercises properly – there’s a good site with instructions at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a>|`|ShVxmkO8aa	I have had excellent results from this guide: <a href="http://www.mistermanpower.net/guide_to_penis_enlargement.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mistermanpower.net/guide_to_p...</a><br>  <br>  About an inch more so far...much recommended|`|DYrDstkMaa	Pumps work, see site for good selection|`|6gBglnyYaa	i have tried foreskin restortion and it worked|`|9vGnxA34aa	Why can't people just be happy with what they got?
cc20d7392e0d4d3d05ba6de3941f41b1aa	I've been smoking dope for about 41 years now, so I guess you  could say I know a little about it.<br>  First, remember it is an intoxicant, so don't go operating dangerous equipment, unless you are very, very sure you can maintain focus.<br>  Reefer affects your reaction time, depth perception, and ability to focus. Or if you do focus, it's just as likely to be a place mat as a TV show that you focus on.  Your age has a  lot to do with it, too.  Re-routing brain waves in a brain that's still trying to figure out the basic routes can have long-lasting effects.  And if you think nobody around you can tell when you're stoned, forget about it.  Over the years, I've learned it's almost always apparent, so I only smoke when I don't really care whether the people notice or not--not in a professional situation, including after work with people you're around a lot at work. Those situations can come back and bite you in the butt.  Not always but being bitten once like that is more than enough.<br>  I don't know if that's the kind of "dope" on dope you were looking for, but I hope it helps.|`|e3i7FWw9aa	yehh|`|xasAaGFaaa	there a little effects. they put a lot of nasty chemicals and stuff in cigs. people think that weed is fine just cause it grows "naturally" but so do tobacco leaves. just be careful if the person growing it does or accidently did use pesticide or any other random thing in growing it. but to asnwer the question there are a lot fewer harmful effects, but still minimal effects|`|AA10558731	Anything done to excess is bad for you, and weed is something that is extremely easy to go overboard on.

Most cases are mild and will give you some stomach discomfort and diarrhea.|`|AA10450066	Yeah, poultry has to be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 to be  done so that any chances of salmonella are dead|`|AA11846603	Yes.  You can get salmonella from under cooked poultry.  However, it is very unlikey that you would get it right away.  Most cases of salmonella occur 24-48 hours after ingestion.  If you start getting very bad stomach cramps accompanied by diarrhea and/or vomitting, I would make a trip to your doctor and recommend that they do a stool collection/culture.  GOOD LUCK!

It won't last forever.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Unfortunately, some girls have heavy periods and some don't.  You seem to be one of the unlucky ones that is going to have to deal with heavy ones.  You aren't doing anything wrong, except maybe the tampons aren't large enough to catch the flow you are having.  However, you are so young that using a larger one might be uncomfortable.  You will probably have periods for the next 40 years, so you may as well join the rest of us and just get used to it.  If you were one of those girls that couldn't wait to have periods, you found out it is not so great the hard way.  <br>  <br>  It is not unusual for girl's periods to be very irregular for the first couple of years.  They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.<br>  <br>  welcome to womanhood..|`|653j6x9maa	i just wanted to say CONGRADULATIONS and welcome to woman hood!|`|Sua2AJIvaa	Everyone is different. Unless you have a condition that affects your period, it should stop in the next few days. You aren't doing anything wrong, I have a heavy flow too, so I also use a pad and tampon. It will usually happen once a month, and it will stop somewhere around your 50's, but as I said, everyone is different, some women stop as early as their late thirties, and some don't stop until they are in their sixties. Sometimes you will skip a month, but it is usually pretty regular. If cramps and headaches become a problem, you can try some advil or something like that. If it doesn't help, you can ask your mm to get you some midol, which is meant to help with pms. (pms stands for pre menstrual syndrome, everyone has it, it's just a part of having your period, but it isn't as too bad for everyone.)<br>  Just remember that this is an important part of growing from a girl into a woman, and it does get easier with time.Good luck!|`|c2a0BgWraa	It usually takes a while for your period to even out and come on a consistant basis. Your tampon should not leak. I find that if mine does, it's not far enough up. If you can feel lit, it's not in there enough. Try getting a mulit pack of tampons so you can use the absorbancy that best fits your flow at that time.  Try supers or super plus. <br>  <br>  Periods last between 3-6 days.  It differs from everyone.|`|ajzdTixPaa	no - it won't it will just be like that for alittle while and it generally lasts (for most people) three to five days you'll be ok your not doing anything wrong<br>   and if you exercise alot or diet you sometimes skip a month which happens to me alot so no worries if that happens its normal too and kinda nice ;) good luck|`|zsOj9Ac0aa	Yeah, it gets lighter the last few days of your period!!!

6e8a2562119ae10db7789da7710dfe93aa	It can be detected - in MOST cases- about 3 months after exposure. It's a simple blood test.To be 100% certain, if you come up negative (no infection) then still stay away from sex or other risky habits like shared needles and get tested also at the 6 month mark. That'll catch the small percentage of people whose immune system hasn't yet made enough HIV antibodies  to be detected. Then you can be sure you are "clean" of the virus.<br>  <br>  Now antibodies help identify a virus to our immune system which then tries to attack it. However the HIV virus is very sneaky and disables parts of the immune system. AIDS is not really a disease...the "S" stands for Syndrome...a collection of symptoms and other diseases which  eventually overwhelm our immune system and then we die.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of AIDS do not typically show up in a normal, healthy person, for about ten years except in very rare cases.<br>  <br>  Check the link below for more information and how HIV and AIDS come about.|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	You will get swollen glands first and they remain swollen.

The aching jaw can be from an infected tooth, to TMJ -a condition where you grind unknowingly at night and you just about wake up and feel your jaw barely opening, and once it does it cracks like crazy. Both would be seen by a dentist.  <br>  <br>  Now, if your glands are swollen, and something that is contagious would be the mumps, or mono. <br>  <br>  An extremely swelling that would cause your throat to swell up would be an extremely allergic reaction to something, and it would not be over a period of weeks, more like a few hours that would require immediate medical attention. <br>  <br>  I'm leaning towards more of the first explanation and follow up with the dentist.
fwWq2llXaa	Run! and don't look back|`|nRFZwdN4aa	In this hypothetical situation, that hypothetical person should call the police and ask about a domestic violence hotline. Someone in that position will understand what it is like to fear for your life and feel too scared to tell a soul. <br>  <br>  This person that is a victim of this closet sociopath has no reason to feel ashamed, because someone without a conscience (or weak one) will often not be what he seems. An abuser may be very adept at concealing that dark side. The more adept they are, the more dangerous they are. <br>  <br>  Most likely, this situation will escalate based on your description. It does not sound like the kind of person who will just back off. Sounds like he has some serious anger management issues. It is only a matter of time before it happens again. Continuing to see him REINFORCES in his mind that it is OK to abuse you. <br>  <br>  Continuing to see him will NOT stop him from being physically abusive. Abusers up the ante, so that it takes less and less to tick them off. The more you reinforce them (by tacitly agreeing it is 'ok' by continuing contact), the more you will be sucked in by their vacuum of misery. A miserable and violent person will do anything to get out of their misery because they cannot stand it when they have no control. <br>  <br>  Contact a domestic abuse hotline or the police department in your area for advice on how to be safe right now.|`|YbVFL3SOaa	Time to find a new boyfriend ASAP.  You couldn't be all that attached to him after only two weeks. Next time it will be worse.  He has anger and control issues that you can not solve.

He never hit me in the face but he has twisted my arm before and pushed me on the bed. And he would always tell me he was sorry and he didn't mean it, etc. I just want you to know it most likely will happen again, my advice would be to leave now before you get attached as I did. I kept going back to him, but he always did it again. I guess it is true that they will not change they will only get worse. sorry i know its a crappy situation|`|zmVg3Q3Caa	First of all why are you ashamed? You are not responsible for his behavior. Second, you need to be aware you were abused by your so called boyfriend. His pattern of handling situations in this manner were established for himself way before you met him.<br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself if you wish to be treated in this manner, more than likely he is not going to change and the more you let him treat you like this the more he shall do so. No woman never deserves to be abused in any manner. You need to seriously consider your relationship with him. The reality is that the percentage of him being abusive with you is extremely high. I suggest you walk away from this relationship.|`|Tsq5rQZGaa	that's scary...i'm so sorry. you do NOT deserve that at all. and whether or not he will do it again is unpredictable...he didn't seem like that type of guy before...it could turn...and then turn again. be careful...don't EVER compromise or take less than what you deserve though...|`|7mrtqwJwaa	Don't ba ashamed. Tell the police, that's considered abuse. You really should leave him, i'm sorry but it's not a healthy relationship.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Get the hell away from him, it will only get worse.|`|87756LlTaa	First:  don't be ashamed.  You are the victim.  He is the a***ole who broke the law, and worse, your trust.  You do not deserve to be abused.  You could kill his dog and cheat on him with his brother, and he still does not possess the right to touch you.  You are now a statistic - that is - unless you do something.  <br>  <br>  He has an illness.  You are not the first person he's hurt.  You will not be the last.  He may feel sorry, but he cannot control his actions.  Please, for all that is good, turn him in.  It will suck for him in the  short term, but you may save another woman from a worse fate.  Or, you may save his future kids from a beating.  <br>  <br>  My dad used to be this way, until my mom stood up for herself, and us kids.  Please trust me.  Don't give him a second chance.  He needs help.  He probably has no control at this point.  Like I said, he probably is sorry, but he needs to learn how to control his actions.|`|8ElD1XGSaa	I have a very angry boyfriend who really does love me but has punched me in the face and almost choked me to death. I never expected it. He always told me he would never hurt me. I started when we stood in line for three hours to see Twilight and didn't get to go in and then he just got mad at me and said he was walking home. I grabbed his shirt and tried to talk to him. He pushed me and I pushed back then he hit me in the face and I slapped him. He grabbed me by the neck and squeezed while he was doing that he looked me in the eyes and said "I've been waiting for this moment for a long time." It freaked me out he also looked like a monster. A man saw and started yelling asking if he should call the cops. My boyfriend let go and booked it. He called me five minutes later bawling and I went to his house and cried with him. I woke up with a purple ring around my neck and had to wear turtle necks. That was a few months ago. He still has anger problems but will never put his hands on me. I suggest that if you really like this guy you be careful. Find out what sets him off. If he's just a simple crush I'd leave him you shouldn't risk anything like that. You may be strong but he'll always be stronger. Hope this helps
flKkoiwbaa	Sorry, but the risks of the radiation you receive outweigh any potential benefits.  You can get adequate vitamin D from a brief exposure to sun, plus fortified foods.  <br>  <br>  Tan or don't tan - it's your skin.  But it ain't a health product, plain and simple.|`|Q1YWtHM2aa	As someone who almost died from melanoma from tanning, I can say that using tanning beds is incredibly stupid.<br>  <br>  If a doctor tells you you're going to die of cancer in your 30's, and you think it was worth it to use the tanning bed, than keep right at it.<br>  <br>  You can buy vitamin D supplements for cheap....that's what you should do.|`|4lLO6kIZaa	No it's not good.. it's fake light.

AA10551261	No, it will continue to build up. If it is that bad there are ear drops specifically formulated to soften excessive wax that are sold at the store. You can also try laying on your side  and putting a drop of warm olive or baby oil i( heated in a microwave) into your ear canal and let it stay in there for a few seconds than tilt your head  on a cloth and the wax along with the oil  should come out easily.  A supply of clean water can then be squirted into the ear to remove ear wax deposits that may remain.|`|SJuOZQRxaa	WHAT are you talking about !its called cue tips.you put water on them,and put in ear and clean it out.

YjxZYbL5aa	Uhhh...are you serious?<br>  No, no they do not. That is ridiculous.

There is nothing AT ALL to indicate that flu vaccines cause cancer. I don't even know where she would get such an idea.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it's important to mention that so-called "Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine" are ****NOT**** Medical Doctors in any way, shape or form. They only have a title in 5 Canadian Provences and 16 US states (ND). They have a very limited scope of practice and cannot prescribe medicine. Most places don't even recognize them as professionals.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Don't you think if it was true that millions of people would have cancer right now? I mean from getting a flu shot..|`|CHiEKZrLaa	LOL<br>  <br>  Okay, to a point I agree with Leah.  It's pretty ridiculous to say a flu shot caused someone's cancer.  And it's unfortunate if your "DNM" friend is claiming that's case, not only because it adds to the general public's confusion about vaccines  but also because claims like that do not reflect highly on the profession!<br>  <br>  So forgive me hopping up on a soap box to defend the profession...<br>  "DNM" is not the same as ND.  DNMs are not certified by NABNE (the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners.)  They have not written board examinations in North America, have not graduated from accredited colleges, and they cannot register as NDs until they demonstrate that their education is equivalent and then write the 2 series of board exams to show their knowledge/skills meet NABNE's stringent requirements.<br>  <br>  NDs are registered in all but 2 provinces in Canada (not sure about the Territories.)  We're governed by our professional colleges/associations, just like MDs.  In addition, there are two (2) boards that oversee NDs - NABNE mentioned above and the BDDT-N (Board of Directors of Drugless Therapy- Naturopathy.)<br>  <br>  NDs do, in fact, attend medical school that satisfies all of the same basic and clinical sciences that MDs take in addition to the "natural medicine" modalities.  In several US states and some Canadian provinces, we're able to prescribe medicines.  We provide parenteral (IV) therapies, gynecologic exams, etc.  We're required to complete a comprehensive physical exam on every patient.  We make diagnoses.  And everywhere that NDs are registered, they're recognized as primary care physicians.<br>  <br>  Okay... hopping off soap box.  As for flu vaccines... well that's a whole other can of worms.  If you're interested, drop me an email and I'm happy to provide some unbiased information on flu vaccines and their efficacy rates.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|IM3QwSS2aa	well your friend is, considering the field of study she's in,  gonna, sorta not be in favor of conventional medicine, but to state a flu shot gives cancer is a little, probably way overboard.<br>  <br>  /jerome|`|ufgv7oTjaa	I agree... I doubt it was just the Flu shot itself, but it's possible that they contracted the Flu from the shot and they may have found out they had cancer. I've never heard of the Flu causing cancer, but at this point in time, nobody has any clue what causes cancer, so researchers are grasping at any straws they can find. Heck, at this point, I've heard that almost everything can cause cancer, even the air you breathe and the water you drink. LOL!!<br>  <br>  It sounds like the friend of yours doesn't like the Flu shot (as many educated Naturopaths don't because of the problems they cause and the limited successful cases), so she may be trying to detract people from getting it... or she might actually believe that the Flu caused her friend's cancer. It's hard to say for sure. Good luck and I hope I helped!

N3UXG9Braa	It is usually not a good idea to induce vomiting. Your body will do that naturally. When you vomit you always run a small risk of asperation (inhaling it into your lungs). If it is food poisoning, your body will get rid of it as needed. Just make sure that you try and drink plenty of water as you can easily get dehydrated from vomiting. Drink the water even if you can't keep it down. The more that your body can absorb, the better. This will also help your body flush out and digest the nasty stuff that is making you sick. If it gets too bad, don't be afraid to go to the doctor to get looked at. Pedialite or similar beverages can also be tried (or sports drinks) to keep some electrolytes. Soup can also be tried, something lite, like Ramen. Sprite or 7-Up can settle my stomach a lot too. I hope this helps, but don't induce vomiting. Feel better soon.|`|mHHZec05aa	Inducing vomiting is never a good idea. The stomach acid will cause erosion of the esophagus and you will have heart burn(GERD). Also, the acid will affect your teeth and know that dental problems may lead to so many other problem. If you do it too much, your blood will have a high pH and thats not good for you. so my answer is NO!|`|CuVnpxh3aa	Unless you know what is wrong with you, you should NEVER induce vomiting. Best thing is to call your Dr and see if s/he will call something in to the pharmacy for nausea. If you can't keep anything down they can give you suppositories for the nausea. They work good. Feel better.|`|sKTmxnx1aa	No, don't induce vomiting.  The acid in your stomach can cause your teeth to erode.  Drink some water, then go to bed.  Hope this helps, and hope you feel better!|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  No need to induce vomiting.  That won't accomplish anything.  Take some pepto and go to bed.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	If it is in your blood already (and it sounds like it is), vomiting will do nothing for you.  Just go to a doctor.
vsaaaSsAaa	Once you've had sex, you should get one every year after.  (even if you haven't had sex since).  <br>  <br>  The reason is: Sex exposes you to the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).  This can infect you and then remain asymptomatic for years.  HPV can cause cervical cancer.  Once you've been infected with it, you need to be checked every year to make sure you don't have cervical dysplasia (precursor to Cervical Cancer).  A pap smear looks for dysplastic cells. <br>  <br>  Since you had sex (raped- so sorry!), you may have the HPV virus.  Don't worry--- 75% of people carry at least 1 of the HPV strains.  But since it's so common, you definitely want to get checked every year.<br>  <br>  You should also talk to your doctor about the GARDASIL vaccine.  It's to prevent infection with HPV.  It is recommended for all girls between 9 and 26 years old, even girls who aren't having sex.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	i dont think it was a pap smear      doctor check to see you you were raped    and did a swap of the semen there ,,,,for courts ,,|`|7O6l3pW2aa	not if your sexually active you don't|`|BZfK54hnaa	It depends how old you are.

PAPs aren't so bad after all.|`|3FdUsKyKaa	You need a yearly pap smear if you are over age 18 or if you are sexually active, whichever comes first.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	When you use a tampon, you insert it into your vagina through your hymen.  I suspect your mother is afraid that if your hymen is stretched too much, that you will have no proof of virginity when you marry and THAT (no proof...meaning NO bleeding on your wedding night) will cause you serious marital problems and/or abuse. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, male muslims have been known to divorce their wives if there is no blood on the wedding night!  And in some cultures, the woman has even been killed by her own family (called "honor killing")!<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you do as your mother requests and NOT use tampons.  You will probably be "safer" by following her guidance.  And once you are married, THEN you can use tampons.<br>  <br>  BTW, you aren't missing much.  Yes, they are convenient but you have to be careful that you don't get a condition called "toxic shock"|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	NO, why?! The proper word is haram, and no it is not at all. Who told you that? Do not let your mother tell you that they are. Religion has nothing to do with getting a period!|`|JuFpYGggaa	There were no tampons when the Koran was written so it can't be forbidden. But some cultures may see it as losing your virginity. It's up to you though.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	I don't anyone can really answer that question, obviously there are interpretations of islam that preech certain habits of cleanliness.  Unfortunately tampons were not available at the time of the holy prophet during revelation.  Further to that, the judeo/christian beliefs at the time had a stigma of impurity given to menstruation, so many people can take that to believe that tampons are unnatural.<br>  <br>  Many girls I know do either pads or tampons, it's more of a personal belief, and any "rule" in islam is merely an interpretation.<br>  <br>  There are some serious infections associated with tampon use which were very prevalent when they first came out (around when your mom was a teenager/young adult), so that may also be influencing her decision.|`|kAbbfrW1aa	hahaha :) (sorry im laugh)<br>  tampon is very usual for woman not depend the religion<br>  <br>  <br>  im a muslim,and  of course  i always using it when i got "the period". until now,no warning for muslim to using it. because there's no point to be danger in use

NkOGRA7laa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  Yes, I believe the zone diet works and I have been eating like that for the last 12 years. I am 37 years old and I weigh the same today as I did when I was in high school and I have had two children, who are now 18 and 15. <br>  <br>  Years ago people thought I was wacko for eating that way, in addition to taking the borage oil, fish oil and flaxseed oil softgels or putting flaxseed oil in my shake. <br>  <br>  Today, studies are coming out saying that eating in that way, keeping control of your insulin level and taking all of those oils are extremely beneficial. I do not have any health problems and I am never sick. But I have made eating like this a way of life, and I am very happy with the results all the way around!<br>  <br>  Yes, the zone delivery food system also works. I have put a few of my bosses on these systems and they worked quite well for them because the food was good and it was convenient.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  w8losschick
AA10350894	The only thing that I could suggest is, now that you are aware of your situation, make an extra effort to apply yourself. Basically, use a mind over matter attitude.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	I recommend slowly adjusting your diet to lessen the amount of wheat/gluten products you eat, and increasing natural foods - fruit and veges especially - also dump sugar. This will be a huge challenge, as it's in so many things (often hidden), that it may take a fair bit of practice in learning to read labels in order than you find out how much junk is out there. Generally, convenience and fast foods are the worst culprits. <br>  <br>  I'd also supplement with a high quality Salmon oil.

7qr2GprBaa	No, in fact I recommend it. But you should only splurge when you PLAN to splurge, so you feel like you're in control. You feel horrible about yourself because you "gave in" to temptation and ended up over eating when you didn't plan to. If you had planned to have pizza tonight, and started off with a healthy withad with low fat dressing, then had 1 or 2 pieces of pizza and scoop of low fat ice cream for dessert, and you planned out your day so you could afford those calories, then you would feel like a success right now, instead of a failure. <br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember is to forgive yourself and move on. Yes, you did a "bad" thing, but it's not the end of the world. You have lost 4 pounds in one months. That is really good, healthy weight loss and you should be really proud of yourself. People who lose 2-3 pounds a week usually end up putting it back on; people who are doing it like you are tend to keep it off forever. <br>  <br>  Tomorrow, do NOT weigh yourself. There is a ton of salt in pizza, which makes you retain water. If you get on the scale it will probably reflect a good 2-3 pounds in water weight gain. Wait until Monday and stick to your diet. Drink a lot of water to "flush out" the salt.<br>  <br>  If you do not already do so, start planning your meals in advance. And again, plan to treat yourself from time to time. Just portion out what you're eating so you can keep track of the calories/carbs/fat grams, or whatever you're counting to lose weight.<br>  <br>  By the way, I knew a guy in college who lost almost 100 pounds by dieting Monday through Friday and eating whatever he wanted on the weekends. There have now been studies that show if you constantly starve yourself, your body actually thinks you are starving, and will hold on to the fat, no matter how little you eat and how much you work out. You have to throw a nice treat in once in a while so your body knows that you're not really starving. My friend from college was proving a theory well before it was being studied.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your weight loss and keep up that good work!|`|ib2BLbDTaa	You sound like me. I think you just have to try to keep that mind set of it's so easy to down 500 plus calories but think about how hard it is to burn it off.  IT IS NOT FUN.  I'd say try to stay away from the pizza delivery guy until you know you can have some self control. I can;t have just one slice of pizza probably not even two. I know I can eat a whole lot more than that so for me eating pizza is like making a deal with the devil, it will never be a good deal for me.  <br>  <br>  A pound is 3500 cals so unless you consumed that times the 4 or 5 pounds you lost you really won't be gaining it all back, you will be onthe wrong route though.  find alternatives to your weakness or stay the hell away until you've hit your first goal.|`|imKCvvFKaa	no, as long as you burn the fat.. just the next time you exercise, you gotta work harder and increase the time you work out, so double th eowrkout... i have a cheat day, which are saturdays:P|`|Q0i7iMmRaa	Yes it will go vomit!|`|BQUU5vp8aa	yeah, one of the healthiest things to do is have  a cheat day once a week. It'll keep you from giving in when you see something yummy because it's easier to say, just wait till Saturday rather than oh I'm not supposed to eat that but it looks so good. If you get in that habbit it can help you keep up your diet. Also, if your craving something sweet, you might try fruit, etc. A lot of times something else that is healthy can fill that craving, and you won't have to cheat.|`|ZMQLV1t4aa	It's ok to spoil yourself every once and awhile. Don't beat yourself up over it too much. Just make sure it doesn't become a habit otherwise all that work you did will be lost. You just got to work a little harder than usual to burn what you just ate. So go ahead and have a pizza or an ice cream, just don't eat the gallon, you know what i mean?|`|2O3fT4neaa	well not instantly because you at 4 slices probably only a pound. but its okay to splurge as long as you take it in small quantities and in longer periods. mayeb every month and a half each TWO slices instead of 4|`|pUltSWNnaa	Yes, reward yourself based off of your results.  Hard work shouldn't go unpunished, hehe.|`|uFiJaR7vaa	splurge is good.  once in a while.  congrats. dont focus on weight. focus on health|`|UDu828VEaa	Nah, you got to have some fun now and then.

It gives you a break from the monotony|`|6627NijZaa	well the pizza and soda will prob get the pounds back|`|haR4lEhlaa	When you're on a diet, you need to have some "splurges" once in a while. However, instead of wolfing down 4 slices of pizza and a can of soda- try to "splurge" in smaller quantities. Have a slice of pizza for lunch one day at work. Have a glass of low fat chocolate milk after dinner one night. Personally, I keep a bag of mini Reeses Cups on the top shelf of my pantry and whenever I feel the need to "splurge", I pop one or two and it's all good.|`|uiOpxomraa	You shouldn't gain any weight back.  Just tell yourself, "tomorrow is a new day."  Go back to whatever you were doing, maybe do a little extra cardio tomorrow.  Don't ever feel bad about "messing up" life is short, enjoy it!  Just next time, remember how you feel now, and you probably won't eat as much.  It's always okay to indulge, just take note of how much you take in, and also, how often.  Good luck, and remember to treat your body well all the time, don't eat so much that you want to vomit, and don't eat so little that you are starving.  Seriously, don't worry, again, one night won't kill your month of hard work, I promise.  Just decide now that tomorrow is a new day and one bad choice won't ruin all of your hard work or keep you from completing your goals.|`|5q9JixlGaa	Trust me, I understand what you are dealing with. The good news is, eating unhealthy food once in awhile will not make you gain weight. Think about it this way, when you go off your diet..you will go back to your normal routine..just not as bad...so you have to keep your body balanced with the good food and some of the bad. But, you must have the will power to go back on your diet after eating unhealthy food..if you do...then you will be fine. You should not throw up, that will mess up your stomach. You will not gain weight from eating pizza slices one day...=] you deserve a break!|`|3vmmvRdYaa	Lol.<br>  In all seriousness, I see the word "splurge" as the work of the devil.<br>  I'm not religious, but I see it as an excuse to break your diet. In my opinion, it's the gateway back into your old eating habits for those who can't control themselves. <br>  I think you splurged a little too much, but didn't that pizza and soda taste good?<br>  =] Hope you get back to your diet. I don't think it will hurt if it was ONE time. If it makes you feel that bad, go do some cardio.|`|AA10920990	Don't go vomit.  It sounds like you're following a good sensible diet.

AA11895162	Not a good idea, but hydrogen peroxide after brushing will do and it won't kill you.  Don't swallow the peroxide.  You can brush after you put the peroxide in your mouth and your mouth will feel absolutely wonderful!!!|`|qpmGLd7laa	Don't do that.  Bleach can kill you and it will inevitably touch everything else in your mouth (gums, soft and hard palates, tonsils, etc.).  You will severely hurt yourself doing that.|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	You will have very nice white teeth, as you lie there in your casket.|`|xBgKqAPHaa	I use a product called Maximum Teeth Whitening . You order it over the internet. For like $30 AUD you get 2 syringes of the whitening gell, instruction booklet and a moulding thing for your teeth and instructions on how to do it.

I did heeps of looking around the internet before i ordered.<br>  <br>  It has worked great for me, i put it in my mouth now and then just to keep my smile white.

I don't know if you have any earthly idea as to what chlorine is... but it's an irritating toxic gas which is pretty harmful to the human body if in contact with. I understand you want your teeth whiter etc etc.. but if you swallow bleach, it can be deadly. Sodium Hyporchlorite is nothing to play around with and can be fatal.<br>  <br>  Why don't you head to CVS and get the mouth wash or something along those lines??|`|AA11315360	NO. You should never put bleach in your mouth! You could die or cause cancer in your mouth by putting bleach in it!<br>  Only use hydrogen peroxide mixed with water once a week or less often. And use whitening toothpastes and mouthwashes and try white stripes.<br>  <br>  DO NOT USE BLEACH! It will not whiten your teeth it may just kill you instead!|`|akvrwpywaa	In theory it probably could.  But you're liable to burn your mouth and swallow some, which would wreak havoc on your digestive system.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes, hydrogen peroxide works well.

AA11315360	First let me educate you. US dental offices no longer use the brand novocaine. It is not sold in the US or made here anymore. Novocaine was not a very good local anesthesia and many people were allergic to it.<br>  Most likely they use lidocaine which is a different drug (breaksdown differently in your body than novocaine did).<br>  Lidocaine lasts longer.<br>  Enjoy the numbness because if you are feeling numb it means you are not feeling pain!!!<br>  <br>  The purpose of making people feel numb longer than the procedure is that you may not need pain medicines which helps avoid people getting addicted to strong pain killers.<br>  <br>  Do not try anything to get rid of the numbness or you will be feeling pain!|`|xav4i5zkaa	Unfortunately not really. You may have just had a larger nerve frozen thats why your frozen for so long. Just hang in there, you'll be unfrozen soon :)
uY8yP8EPaa	Only you know the answer to that, lol.|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	You are not having a breakdown, and you do not belong in a mental hospital.  You are fourteen.  You lied to your dad and then came back and told him about it moments later (not the smartest idea!). You did something very stupid and I think you realize it.  In essence you destroyed the very thing that you set out to do which was getting attention from him, feeling validated, and having some sympathy. I think your actions speak very clearly as to what your reasoning behind your behavior were.  I really believe that the main issue here is poor communication skills with your dad.  Keep in mind that this is a very tough time not for only you, but also your dad.  A teenager  has soo many things happen that are dramatic, attention seeking and quite frankly very annoying.  More things happen in a span of five minutes with teenagers than happen in weeks for an adult.  It is very time consuming and exhausting dealing with this on a regular basis.|`|S2foMjmKaa	You dropped a bowling ball on your foot, you cant get committed these days without being to threat to yourself or others.<br>  <br>  Just relax and go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Also, don't drop anything else on your foot.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You seem to be scared of your father and his opinion.

Why can't you be honest?|`|E23s2wSNaa	ur not psycho, ur young, and u want attention, as u get older, attention doesnt matter to u anymore, so dont worry about it, but u did go to far for attention thats for sure, but ur  young|`|sbvbYatQaa	You sound like you wanted to please your dad.

Things like--when he asks you about your day --that's your chance to get his attention. little things like that- connect with your dad, be real about things. that's all it takes. I bet even if he didn't show it, hes probably torn by the fact you hurt your foot on purpose. It just seems to me you two need to connect a little more. make sense?

xvey8ixPaa	Your cornea is a different steepness than the rest of your eye. If you close your eye and touch your lids with your hands and move your eye a bit you can feel that. Your cornea is measured by your doctor and the proper contact lens size is given to you. If it fits right it will float nicely and stay on your cornea like it should. If it is too tight, it might suck on there and not come off well or not move enough. A loose lens might float all over your eye as well. I hope I helped and did not make matters worse for you!|`|RPoFBenJaa	i just got contacts. The shape of the contact fits the shape of the front of your eye. I mean, your whole eye is shaped like a sphere (unless u have astigmatism like me) so it just sticks to it. It wouldnt fit right to the other parts of your eye if it moved around causing it to pop out. Mine dont fit because of my astigmatism (oval shaped eye) so I have to get new ones this week. Ugh. I always wondered the same thing though. Weird.
n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|KzJz17Rxaa	Do what Amateras said. Just be sure you know how many calories you need to be eating to lose. Most people don't have any idea!<br>  <br>  This will give you a number to start with. To lose weight eat 300-500 calories less than it suggests. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calcalcs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calcalcs.h...</a><br>  <br>  Keep in mind, the less fat you have, the longer it takes to lose. Our bodies are genetically programed to hold on to that last bit of fat.
NzR25cQAaa	Try making yourself more tired before you fall asleep<br>  <br>  More fatigue, maybe you're mind will keep in sync.|`|AA10450066	If you stop and think about it ,before you wake up, you usually don't remember what you dreamed about (REM) sleep, that gives our body the actual down time we need to grow. When this happens you don't remember falling asleep in the first place and when your subconsciously unaware of falling asleep it's creeping you out.Some people go to sleep with the TV on or listening to music so you drift of while your conscious is doing something. It takes time for everyone to "shake the cobwebs" off and get ready to greet the day.Only exceptions I know of are little ones  until a certain age.|`|IEaedB5Eaa	When your body falls asleep before your mind, that is a sign of exhaust. So you definitely need to sleep,you are too tired, just let your body rest and don't worry about struggling to wake up. :-)|`|080iXsSfaa	holy crap going to sleep is a scary thing.  i mean what if you stop breathing while you are asleep and you just die!  man, i wouldnt go to sleep if i were you.  yikes|`|HlXrHd52aa	I've had that sensation you are talking about, and it is scary!  I've tried to stay awake on purpose.  I'm not sure if it's a medical condition or not...but I do realize that it happens when I am EXTRA exhausted!  Try to make sure you are getting plenty of sleep and exercise, and eating right.|`|8pG8Y3rJaa	You might have answered your own question - fear.  You might be a little afraid of something right now.  But maybe not - I went through a stage like this and once in a while still do.  Sometimes I "startle" just as I'm falling alsleep.  Our minds and bodies do wierd things, usually nothing to worry about too much.|`|eO35QeTeaa	I have a fear of sleeping too. I dont know how i got over it but i did. Now, i am worried and afraid to sleep again. I just tire myself out before going to be so i can pass out. I dont recommend sleeping pills unless prescribed by a doctore.|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	drink so sudafep or some sleeping pills so u can go to sleep faster, if your afraid then just go to the doctor and get some counciling.|`|uY8yP8EPaa	You need to see a doctor about this, especially if it scares you like that|`|QUJ4F5Boaa	One, two--Freddy's coming for you...|`|B27oNdbNaa	Who are you afraid of? Freddy Kruger?|`|R3WAqTCHaa	Yes, that is very scary. It's called sleep paralysis. When we fall asleep our body is supposed to go paralyzed. If our body doesn't go paralyzed, we act out our dreams. If we have a dream we are fighting someone we may start fighting with our body. If we have a dream we are driving we could possibly get up and walk out our door and get into our car. Get it? So, naturally, your body shuts down your ability to act out those dreams when you go to sleep. <br>  <br>  When you are in deep sleep sometimes you can wake up consciously but your mind has not signaled your body to wake up yet. I won't lie to you, if you panic in one of these episodes in rare cases it has been dangerous. The most important thing to do is stay calm, and tell yourself  it's okay. Your body will know to wake up soon enough. Although you can't move a finger, you can still breathe.<br>  <br>  Often when I have had these episodes I felt like I was dying. But you're not. You are still breathing and JUST FINE, your body is physically asleep still. It's the scariest feeling in the world, I know. But depriving yourself of sleep can actually bring on more sleep paralysis episodes. I remember the last time it happened to me I didn't want to sleep for days. But it's more likely to happen when you are not getting enough sleep. I know plenty of people who suffer with this from time to time, and although it's scary, everyone is just fine.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest telling your doctor you have been having sleep paralysis and it's been scaring you. Bottom line, it's common and not likely to keep happening constantly. It usually happens every great once in a while.|`|WJpJ6CVpaa	Oh my god.<br>  That used to happen to me. For like months and months, every night I would finally get on the edge of sleeping and I would freeze, be unable to move or breath, I would have to jerk myself REALLY hard to move, then I couldn't get back to sleep because I would be afraid it would happen again. It used to happen 3-4 times a night.<br>  <br>  I swear it was so awful I block out the memories of it<br>  <br>  Maybe try seeing a sleep doctor, and message me if you find out what it was because this thing stopped me from sleeping for months!<br>  <br>  What I did to rid myself of it:<br>  <br>  1. I slept with my mom for a night - ya i know, lame but it didn't happen when I was with someone else oddly<br>  <br>  2. Meditated - this seemed to work<br>  <br>  3. De-Stress - this was also good, in the end it got rid of the sleep problem<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, don't worry it WILL go away :)|`|QPRwqbDlaa	In my opinion you seriously need to see a professional. The case you described may be due to a certain mental condition that I myself have heard of. When you go to sleep, your body goes into a kind of mild paralysis which makes it so that your body doesn't act out the dreams that your mind is projecting. I think that your body is doing this too early when your mind is not yet ready. In some cases, this may cause partial or complete loss of motor control. See a docter ASAP!!!|`|gjKqBJwKaa	look for sleep paralysis, ,that's what you have, it's a very common disorder, that causes "night terror"(incubus) it's because of a problem on a part of your brain called the reticular formation, nothing to worry about really it most likely will go away on it's own, normally people in their teens have this for a period of time ( also as adults but just occasionaly )|`|9jbifeYcaa	Thats not unusual.  Dont be scared of it.  This has happened to me... plus as much as it doesnt feel nice for a minute, soon your back to normal.  Sounds like your really uptight when your going to bed too, fighting the sleep.  Maybe you should try some relaxation methods. even just a cd.|`|5FY5SZjIaa	I would tell the people or person you live with then go see a doctor this can be serious or maybe your not mentally tired try thinking of things that make you sleepy then go to sleep|`|AvdrrU19aa	mmmmm that is strange try going to the doctor?|`|0pDhpailaa	talk to your doctor <br>  he/she may be able to help|`|sSUjLhyLaa	go see a doctor!|`|ugcMPr20aa	Definitely GO TO YOUR DOCTOR!!!!!!!|`|bkgBLjuvaa	hun, go to the doctors... they'll help you.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|X1TeqHcxaa	Try the Internet.|`|ghD5kN82aa	The pain may be in your leg, but the trouble could be in your back: You might have partially dislocated your spine and it is pinching a nerve. If so, it will get worse without treatment (see an Ostiopath). Only your doctor can tell. Do get proper attention ASAP.  Good luck.
46oOn3yeaa	well i think it is safe aslong as you are eating nutirtionist foods. but it will not work if you do not burn more calories than you take in so you you must excersise. oh and in order to burn fat you have to drink atleast 64 oz. of water a day, since your kidneys wont have in of fuel to do there work without in of water, and when your kidneys cant complete there job the liver has to help it and the livers job is to metablolize fat which it cant do at full capacity if it has to help the kidneys.|`|tIldpr7vaa	sounds good|`|1tjJPHpMaa	I try to aim for 1,300 calories each day.

KchNxZ6yaa	Hmmm Ok|`|AA11785060	Nope, you have what you have. Many guys, a big percentage in fact have patchy beard growth, often with many bare patches.  Rogaine won't make hair grow where it never was. <br>  For your neck issue, try getting a shaving mirror to put in your shower, wet your beard and lather up early, soap the rest of the body, then shave, that will give the whiskers time to soften. Just shave downward too, no upward strokes which can cause nicks and cuts.  Good luck. Also no mess with shaving in the shower.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	First of all you probably have sensitive skin.  That why you cut easily.  Get a Sensitve foam and a gentle razor.  2nd don't put rogaine on your face.  Just shave in areas where it's patchy.  You can't change your DNA.  Just grow whatever is full and thick or shave all together.  I can't grow on my cheeks well either so just have chin hair or a goat tee.|`|63bad0287364f42fcb1f15fc1fcea2a0aa	Unfortunately, there is not much you can do about your uneven growth of hair.  Roagine works on a different type of hair follicle and will not work on your face.  The answer Just below mine is right in that you need for find a beard style that works with your growth pattern.<br>  <br>  The bumps on your neck from shaving you can help.  Try softening those hairs with a hot towel or by showering before you shave.  A warming shaving cream dispenser like those in high end barber shops is also an idea.  But, more importantly is your razor and the way you use it. Stay away from cheap disposables like those with plastic handles and are sold by the bag.  Use a decent cartridge razor like the Quattro or Fusion.  Notice the direction the hair grows in by letting it get a little long so you have significant stubble.  Then when you know the direction shave in the same direction.  Do not shave against the grain.<br>  <br>  Finally finish off with warm soap and water.  This should stop your bumpy problem.  and don't use and electric razor.
7YPdogmDaa	Sounds like staph to me. I got staph in the tattoo on my foot recently. I got the same meds you did, Doxcylliin and a Sulfa antibiotic and pretnesone steroid pills...the pain lessened over a few days, but wasn't completely gone until two weeks. If your doctors don't seem worried you shouldn't either. I know the prospect of having staph is scary but its not always as bad as you hear of it being. Be sure to finish your meds, if you don't finish them, you'll have a infection that is antibiotic-proof. Good luck.|`|tSi10jneaa	Well trust your doctors and the reports. If there's nothing wrong then actually there's nothing to worry. I empathize though.<br>  Doxycycline is indeed used for infection but it can be any bacterial infection. Remeber do not drink alcohol when on doxycycline.<br>  Chest pain - was it lower half or midsection - it can be due to acidity because of the consumption of doxycycline.<br>  If you still feel insecure, do not hesitate to visit another doctor, however make him aware that you're in for second opinion just before is about to prescribe you something. In that way you will come to know what exactly is going on in his mind.|`|h3HjLZ4daa	I think perhaps you are seriously stressed (chest pains).  That antibiotic is a typical antibiotic used for many infections and not just for staph.  and if it is staph they are treating it.  It can take 48 hours in most cases to feel the result of taking an antibiotic.  You are under a doctor's care so wait to see what she says about the culture and go from there.  If you don't feel you are getting appropriate care then yes, see another doctor.

1BbnyTfBaa	You are not violating the laws of physics.  The reason that you are not losing weight is that you are eating as many calories as you are burning.  To lose weight, you must eat less than you burn.<br>  <br>  I lost 65 pounds in the last 13 months.  Here's my method.  Calculate your target weight for every day and write it on a calendar.  I lose five pounds per month, so I subtract one pound each six days.  Weigh yourself every morning.  If you are over your target weight, eat less and exercise more that day.  That's it!

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.

3FdUsKyKaa	Wow, these other answers are terrible! Way to scare this young girl for NO REASON...<br>  Getting your period and going through puberty is a natural and normal part of life. It is good because it means you are developing normally and you are growing up. If you are excited to grow up, it makes sense that you would be excited about your impending 1st period.<br>  I was always a mature girl and I was excited to get my period and become a woman. I know how you are feeling.<br>  As far as whether your period will "suck"... you may get cramps, your tummy may feel sick or full, you may be cranky and weepy, some women get headaches, etc... but its all part of being a woman. Its not unbearable, and theres always Midol and Pamprin (I think Pamprin is better, personally), which are medicines to help with these uncomfortable symptoms. <br>  You should absolutely embrace your womanhood, and its very grown up of you to be excited to become a woman.|`|ryutqTrSaa	i was excited to before i had my period...<br>  its not all its cracked up to be, you get cramps, headaches, and stomachaches.<br>  so just don't rush it.<br>  and im 13 to me im not a woman because i really dont have a job, so i can't claim womanhood, maybe teendom, but not woman hood.|`|Lj0eT5n2aa	i guess its kinda normal, but it SUCKS!!!! really bad! lol try to hold on to ur pre pubistiy!(is that even a word?! lol!) anyway! that for as long as u can trust me!!!!! cause once u get ur gonna be saying! What the BLOODY! HECK! was i thinking! lol|`|ThamTbJ8aa	haha it sucks enjoy ur period free days while they last!!!|`|rtU5iTZAaa	itt suckksss !|`|c2a0BgWraa	LOL, no it's not weird at all.  A lot of girls go throught that and feel just like you doThey want boobs and hips and their periods.  I was not one of those girls though. I got boobs at nine, my period at eleven and hips sprouted. Never wanted any of it. = )tfriend in middle and high school was just like you, really eager and didn't get hers until she was fourteen. <br>  <br>  No you should not be scared. Not at all.  Having a period is cool.  There are some parts about it that are not so great though. Sometimes the flow is heavy(which means more blood), some women get cramps.  I was a cramp sufferer from day one. It takes some getting used to, but from the sound of it, you'll love it no matter what! <br>  How old are you by the way.|`|AtjlmByAaa	Hi, all you can do is wait for it, I know what you're feeling, I also did feel the same when I was a teen-age, its because I want to be sure that I am normal just like any other girls, there may be fear within you that there's something wrong with you if you didn't reach the point of having a monthly menstrual.  But you know, its just exciting at first, but when you're regularly having periods, you would sometimes feel and ask why do females have to experience all these, its some kind of somewhat disturbing  my activities, you need to check and watch your schedules that may be affected by your periods.  Another thing, according to some experts, the later the better, coz you wouldn't have to face early menopausal period which can lead to fast aging.|`|AkUbblW8aa	I hate the pain that we have to go through, but I love being a girl.

Have fun!!!|`|fRdGKrGoaa	it does suck but i was excited when i hit puberty as really for me the only thing that sucks is my period but if you have that same problem you will eventually get use to it <br>  good luck when you to start going through it|`|vLfoNJXWaa	It's ok to be excited!

73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	You aren't brushing and flossing properly.  Food particles and plaque are irritating your gums, causing them to be swollen.  Go to the dentist and have your teeth cleaned, then keep up on it by flossing at least 3 times a week, if not everyday.  If you already have braces on, then you can get a special flossing instrument (can't think of the name of it!!) -it's like a super-mini bottlebrush looking thing that you use between your teeth since you won't be able to get floss in there.  (hummingbird??? it's called something like that)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	They are swollen because of improper brushing and flossing!|`|PjyP8yEiaa	Floss!!! Usually inflammation of the gums especially while in braces is caused by not enough flossing. Your gums will bleed for the first 4-7 days after you begin flossing. But continue and if you floss and brush you will be ok. The inflammation will go down.
xvey8ixPaa	Take Ibuprofen. Put an ice pack on it. Icing it down will make a big difference.|`|kykmpr0Caa	TAKE IT OUT....|`|je6LaALyaa	sometimes putting on some kind of saline solution helps cool it down and feel better. most piercing places sell this.
0nyWiro9aa	You need to notify the blood donation center in order to quarantine your blood products until the issue is resolved. <br>  <br>  Let me say that it is unusual to have repeat liver enzyme testing regularly and you give no reason for it. The liver panel is typically done for not reason and so it's hard to evaluate the situation properly without any medical history.<br>  <br>  Drugs are usually first on the list when it comes to unexpected lab results including the liver enzymes. Red rice yeast works because it contains a natural statin drug and when somebody takes a statin drug then they need to monitor their liver via the transaminases.<br>  <br>  It may also be something entirely different and hopefully not viral in origin and that is why you should notify the donor center. <br>  <br>  Your doctor who ordered the test needs to investigate and repeat testing to see if it keeps going up and how high they go. They need a physical and history.

VbvrG9NJaa	okay I know a medicain that helps for a soar throat. <br>  Well what you do is you get some water and then some salt and pour it into it then swish it around and gurgle it and spit it out do this 3 times and within an hour or so it will be calm down but thats only for a a short while.
ZqaImrbLaa	The bacteria that cause strep throat tend to hang out in the nose and throat, so sneezing, coughing, or shaking hands can easily spread the strep infection from one person to another. That's why it's so important to wash your hands as often as possible.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	I think it is possible, if only because one person might have a greater resistance to the strep bacteria than another.  Also, your own resistance might vary over time.  Strep bacteria are very common.
mAQHyfCYaa	Well be reassured that there isn't really a 'normal pattern'. there is an average cycle, but every single person is different. Be lucky you are already pretty regular, also every 5 weeks is better then every 2 or 3.<br>  <br>  And thinner blood and brownish blood is fine. Some women have thicker menses and some have thinner, it all depends on different hormones that control how and why you bleed. The blood is brownish because that's the color blood tends to turn when it 'dies'. Obviously the blood has time between when it is removed from the uterine lining to exiting the vagina to 'die' and turn brown. So no worries!|`|ZCAnfK3Taa	you're period will be brown when its fairly light and redder when its heavy so that's perfectly normal mines brown at the start and end and red in the middle of the week and yes your period will be irregular for around the first 2 years so that's fine everybody is different|`|BRDqfAy3aa	Regularity is most important - if you have period every 35 days, it is OK - read more below

I had a bit of bleeding like that once and then nothing at all for a couple of months,.. then my period started.  Its nothing to worry about.  And the brown discharge is normal too.

AA11522944	You could have a ‘skin bridge’.<br>  <br>  ‘Skin bridges’ usually result from injury to the glans (head) of the penis and foreskin which - during the healing process - fuse together. This kind of injury can be the result of attempting to force a child’s foreskin back before it has naturally detached from the glans of the penis.<br>  <br>  Skin bridges are often associated with circumcision because the process of circumcision deliberately and prematurely detaches the foreskin from the glans injuring both.  See the link below for pics of ‘skin bridges and other complications caused by circumcision.<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm#bridge" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm#bridge</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/Botched1sb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/Bo...</a><br>  <br>  Skin bridges are usually rectified with minor surgery. If you think you have a skin bridge see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Please note that the ‘frenulum’ – the band of skin that attaches the foreskin to the underside of your glans penis - is NOT a ‘skin bridge’ and never detaches.

It's better to build your staying power naturally through practice and experience rather than using something artificial.<br>  <br>  There's nothing you can do about the colour of the head of your penis.

1BbnyTfBaa	I had my gall bladder removed by laproscopic surgery.  It was my first  surgery under general anesthesia, but now I have general anesthesia a total of four times for operations.<br>  <br>  My overall advice is that there is no reason to be afraid.  You are not expected to know how to do anything.  The doctors and nurses know what they are doing and they will take good care of you!<br>  <br>  Here is what it was like for me all four times, and it was two different teams of doctors-nurses who operated on me.<br>  <br>  I show up early in the morning, like 6:30 or 7:30 for surgery at midday.  They put me in a temporary room where I change into a hospital gown and lie on the bed.  My relative came into the room while I waited.  So then I waited, with nothing to do, for several hours.  I suggest taking a book.  Also, take a gym bag, back pack, or small suitcase to hold all of your clothes, etc. while you are in surgery.  (They gave me plastic bags, but a gym bag would have been nice to have.)<br>  <br>  Eventually, they rolled me from the waiting area to a prep area where I waited for maybe 20 minutes.  Then a bunch of people showed up, introduced themselves, and started doing things all at once.  That included asking me a lot of medical type questions that I don't remember.  Oh, I do remember one.  They asked, "Which leg are we operating on today?"  And then wrote YES on that leg and NO on the other one.   So for 15 minutes or so, several people are hovering over you giving you IVs and doing other stuff to get you ready.<br>  <br>  When that's done, they wheel you to the operating room.  In my case they started giving me drugs on the way to the OR.  A couple of times, I was unconscious before I got there, and a couple of times, they kept me awake so I could move from the gurney to the operating table under my own power.<br>  <br>  Once on the operating table, they put a mask on me and told me to count backwards from 100.  There was no odor.  I counted backwards to about 95 and then I woke up in the recovery room where there were half a dozen other people "recovering."  It didn't seem like any time had passed.  And was I ever loopy!  Those are some good drugs they give you!!  It was kinda like being drunk, but different.  Not bad; not good; just odd.<br>  <br>  In the recovery room, I was talking my head off because of the drugs.  Other people were quiet.  They probably wished I would shut up.  After a while in the recovery room, they wheeled me to another waiting room and told me that I couldn't go until I could pee.  The anesthesia paralyzes your bladder and you can't leave the hospital until it has worn off and you can pee.<br>  <br>  Being under anesthesia dries you out, too.  So, you are dehydrated, your bladder is paralyzed, and your job is to pee.  I was really, really thirsty, so it was easy to drink lots and lots and lots of soft drinks and water.  You might want to take a one-quart water bottle in your gym bag.  They kept giving me water and soda in 8 oz paper cups and it was very inefficient.<br>  <br>  So, after what seemed like a long time trying to pee, I finally squeezed some out and was discharged with a couple of prescriptions for pain medicine.  Plan on stopping at the pharmacy on your way home.  Well, I was discharged when I had the gall bladder operation, but I stayed in the hospital when they operated on my leg.  So the only thing different was that I woke up in my hospital room and didn't have to prove I could pee.<br>  <br>  That's it!  It couldn't be easier.  The main adversity you'll face is boredom, so bring something to read.<br>  <br>  If you're leaving the hospital, you might bring a snack, since you will have been fasting for the operation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|In9VWqXKaa	My wife had laproscopic surgery to remove her appendix, they put her under and everything was fine.

mAQHyfCYaa	How much underage? And in what country do you live in? What are the laws? Who do you want to have sex with?<br>  <br>  Also, why do you want to have sex? There is a lot of info needed to properly answer your question. <br>  <br>  The only tip I would suggest is masturbation. It isn't the same as sex but it does help 'calm' the sexual urges somewhat.|`|yyIVrngcaa	Every teenage girl goes through this stage in their life..Most of them decide to just "do it" out of curiosity and uncontrollable urges...basically cuz they're so vulnerable and young. Whatever you decide to do, just know it all has consequences, always be careful...<br>  I would suggest experimenting with yourself, just take it easy...<br>  You will regret having sex before 16, i assure you that...even then, I'd hope when you do it's with someone you won't regret later on either..<br>  <br>  btw...as soon as you start masturbating, you're most likely going to want to have sex, so I'd suggest try to control your hormoes as much as possible.<br>  good luck*|`|dpgXzMenaa	Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The whole time, it's just about the best feeling there is.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|x5nWWyylaa	Masturbation.<br>  Pretty much the only thing i can think of.<br>  don't do it until you are of age<br>  and your completely sure you have found the right person<br>  you only loose it once<br>  so loose it wisely.|`|Wpl7bC6Vaa	I had lots of sex underage so whats the big deal if you start young?

ADP9swbMaa	Yes it will show up on their bill. <br>  If you're going to a clinic like Planned Parenthood, tell them that you do not have insurance. And, yes, privacy is a valid reason not to use your current insurance. Most clinics, and I know PP, offer their services on a sliding scale. So, if make under a certain amount of money, you will not have to pay anything for your birth control supplies.<br>  <br>  What John said is true: You may have to wait several hours to see a doctor at a free or low-cost clinic, though sometimes there is very little wait, especially if you are just buying supplies. However, free or very low-cost birth control is worth the wait every couple of months (they usually give you a 3-month supply at a time). The best thing to do would be to call in advance and make an appointment. You will see a doctor much faster that way then if you just walk in with no appointment.|`|paerqxfMaa	Yes, it would show up, however, I don't think insurance covers birth control.  It's been a bone of contention that they won't cover birth control, but will cover Viagra for men.  They'll pay for the guy to be able to get the girl pregnant, but won't pay for the woman to prevent it.  It's insanity at it's best!!|`|p9GOxzsNaa	You need a prescription plan for medication and some insurance policies don't include prescriptions and some prescription plans won't cover birth control. Any benefits and prescription will show up on a statement and be part of the permanent record. If there is a prescription plan, most have a co-pay requirement, which would be billed or paid upfront, but still leaves a record of the prescription. If you live near a big city, they will have a free clinic but you might need to wait for 4 hours or more to see the doctor, or you could call local Planned Parenthood to see what they can offer for birth control - it varies in different states and cities, or pay for the BC pills with your own cash.  The best thing is to talk to your Mom and just be upfront on the situation, since it sounds like you still live at home with your parents.|`|rdKuvxYJaa	your still under 18 so you should still be eligible to use there medical insurance if you still live under there roof and they still take care of you. yes when the statement comes it will have the reasons why the insurance is being billed its the law. be honest with your parents especially your mother about what you want or need she might surprise you. if you want the birth control to help with regulating your periods and balancing your hormones then it should not be such a "big secret" but if you want it to be sexually active then take this into consideration. the pill did not work for me, I took the pill from the age of 16 to help regulate my periods and hormones til the age of 21 when I got pregnant while on it the first time i had sex and trust me I set my clock to go off when it was time for me to take it each morning so I was on a very strict schedule with it, never missed a pill. my daughter will be 15 yrs old this summer. the 1st time i ever had sex was 21 and on my honeymoon.|`|VBFNnIMzaa	There is no absolutely right answer for your question.Nonetheless,explorer the information here <a href="http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insuran...</a>  might give you some ideas.HOpe it helps.
TCpTlCTRaa	I am a woman who went through this at age 32. I ended up losing most of my hair Thankfully I learned about aromatherapy for hair loss and was able to restore my hair. I found out that I have chronic telogen effluvium so I depend on essential oil treatments whenever I have a hair loss episode. My story was published in Natural Health Magazine. Because of the response, I realized that this is a problem that effects so many women. You can read my story at the site listed below. You will also find articles and information on the types and causes of female hair loss at the site listed below.|`|bkXCFCewaa	My dad had been suffering from hair loss and only recently he started to see a huge difference with his hair (lots of fine hair growing out especially at the temple area) after trying out the <br>  various natural techniques taught to grow hair for 1 week at this website <a href="http://www.regrowmyhair.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.regrowmyhair.info</a> <br>  <br>  I must say its a very informative, effective and easy to follow step-by-step guide.

IM3QwSS2aa	invest in a few doses of STIFF NIGHTS.<br>  <br>  /jerome, puts his seal of approval on that.|`|F1OIGwtBaa	First thing its to get a complete physical and evaluation by your doctor to eliminate the conditions known to contribute to erectile function. There are many conditions related to prostate, blood pressure and who-knows-what else that can have an effect on a man.<br>  <br>  Once given a 'clean bill or health' in that department, there are products advertised on many channels that promise help. Asumming you've either already tried them or are not interested, there are other possible solutions.<br>  <br>  One of the commonly overlooked factors that can have a negative effect is blockage in some of the tiny capillaries located in and around the penis. This can be plaque, cholesterol, or other matter in the bloodstream that blocks arteries. Most of what blocks arteries is some form of protein. Taking a supplement that will help clear build-up out of the arteries (and intestines) MAY help. This link is to a good brand of protease (enzyme that digests proteins) at an incredibly low price. I take one before bed every night and you can also take one before any meal that includes a portion of meat. Definitely worth trying at $10 for 180 capsules.<br>  <a href="http://www.vitacost.com/NSI-BioCore-Pro-Digestive-Systemic-Enzymes-w-Bromelain" rel="nofollow">http://www.vitacost.com/NSI-BioCore-Pro-...</a><br>  High cholesterol and triglycerides can have a negative effect. Smoking is high in cholesterol - quitting or avoiding others who smoke could be beneficial.<br>  <br>  Take a 20-30 minute walk every day. Improved circulation can lend a hand.<br>  <br>  If your doctor clears your health, you may want to consider doing a mild and complete detox. Mannatech.com has a product called MannaCleanse that is all natural, organic, thorough and gentle. It's a 2 month program that will never tie you to the commode or cause embarrasing events in public. I highly recommend it (yes, have used it - you'd be amazed at how much old matter is stuck in your gut!!) There are many detox products on the market. If you choose this route, find one that is all natural and takes a minimum of 2 weeks to complete. The faster detox products are harsh and not thorough. <br>  <br>  These are some of the simplest ways I know to start finding out what your needs are. They may not fix your woe, but none of these will hurt you or be a waste of your time and $$.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  God Bless
LDEa6yDcaa	this happens most of the time. it is very hard to quit smoking or drinking. try to tell your dad that you would like to have a heart to heart talk with him. try to keep your voice at a low level and make him understand that you are not trying to judge him, only that you love him and don't want to lose him.maybe offer to try to help him come up with a plan to quit his habits. explain to him that someday you will want him to attend your graduation if you go to school, walk you down the aisle if you are female and play with the kids you may have in the future (if you don't have some now). explain that they will want to have a papaw!!! tell him that you are not ready to give up your hero yet!!!<br>  good luck to you on this!<br>  the dj man said that!|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Tell Him How Much Yur Family Loves Him And You Dont Wanna Loose Him It Might Get To Him|`|CLXzIoloaa	BURN THE SMOKES QUIKLY CONVINCE HIM TO STOP  YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN DO THIS!!!!|`|63bad0287364f42fcb1f15fc1fcea2a0aa	I agree with Ryan.  You should start by talking to him.  If you can not persuade him then there is nothing you can do.  I have nagged my wife for years to stop smoking.  Right now her mother is living with us while her mother dies from lung cancer.  Still nothing gets through.  Sometimes you have to accept that your loved one is going to shorten their life.  It is a difficult decision that they make and you have to live with.  It truly sucks.  But, you need to appreciate the time you have and make everyday count and not waste time nagging, bickering or arguing about a change he is not willing to make.  Good Luck!|`|SltEwVX7aa	you can't and won't make him stop.  he's got to want to do that himself.|`|AA11522944	Unfortunately you can't MAKE him stop.

You or your child may feel sick, tired, and not very hungry. The chickenpox rash usually appears about 1 or 2 days after the first symptoms start. Some children get the chickenpox rash without having a fever or other early symptoms.<br>  <br>  It usually takes 14 to 16 days to get the symptoms of chickenpox after you have been around someone with the virus. This is called the incubation period.<br>  <br>  After a chickenpox red spot appears, it usually takes about 1 or 2 days for the spot to go through all its stages. This includes blistering, bursting, drying, and crusting over. New red spots will appear every day for up to 5 to 7 days.<br>  <br>  You or your child can go back to work, school, or day care when all blisters have crusted over. This is usually about 10 days after the first symptoms start.<br>  <br>  Other illnesses can have symptoms like those of chickenpox. For this reason, you may think you have had chickenpox twice when instead you have had two different infections.<br>  Treatment for chickenpox (varicella) depends on a person's age, health, and severity of the illness.<br>  <br>      * Healthy children with chickenpox may need only home treatment. This includes taking acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil) to reduce fever and discomfort and taking nonprescription oral medications or using lotions to reduce itching. (Do not give aspirin to people younger than 20 because of the risk of Reye's syndrome). Oatmeal baths also can relieve itching.<br>      * Healthy teens and adults with chickenpox usually have more severe symptoms than children and are at higher risk for complications than children. Still, most need only home treatment. All adults with chickenpox should be seen by a health professional; some may need hospital care.<br>      * Pregnant women and people with immune system problems are also at increased risk for complications. They should see a health professional immediately if they suspect they have chickenpox.<br>  <br>  Medical treatment may include a shot of chickenpox antibodies to delay or prevent a person from having chickenpox, and also may include antiviral medication to shorten the length of the disease. The chickenpox (varicella-zoster) vaccineClick here to view a form.(What is a PDF document?) also can be given if you have been exposed to chickenpox; this treatment may prevent you from having the illness.

IODhng5qaa	im bipolar borderline personality ocd recovering addict and has had a eating disorder for like 11 years ive been in many hospital placements, i know alot about mental illnesses but i dont think you should come on the interwebzzz to find out if you have a mental illness. You need to see a doctor, if you feel out of control to the point you need to ask strangers. Take the time you are on yahoo answers and  go to a doctor, they can help you alot better and put you on the right medication.|`|ki3XY49daa	As someone who is bipolar, I can tell you that it starts to manifest in the teen years and gets increasingly worse.  I'm also a rapid cycler.  Where someone with regular cycles would only have one or two downs a year, I have one every other month or so.  You should really see a professional as soon as you can and get it under control now.  If you don't, you could put yourself in danger of going into a suicidal depression and those are very hard to come out of.  Being bipolar sucks, but you can treat it and you can get it under control.|`|np5VgFelaa	To be truly suffering from bipolar, you must have both periods of mania, like your grandmother and mom, AND periods of depression. If you don't have both, then it isn't bipolar--it's unipolar. <br>  <br>  Now, from what you're describing I'm not sure if you have bipolar. There are obvious issues going on here and I implore you to go to a professional for help. Cutting and hairpulling is a form of self mutilation, which is sometimes indicative of borderline personality disorder. Interestingly, this disorder manifests itself in a very similiar way to bipolar. They are sometimes confused with one another.<br>  <br>  I suggest doing some online research and going to see a therapist or psychiatrist.

8e5f9cb1082d891d0f3075f0e2e92d34aa	Organic Apple Cider Vinegar. It helps to balance the PH levels in your stomach. Antacids, and milk are things you should avoid. Acid reflux is caused by too little acid, not too much acid. Taking the Apple Cider Vinegar will help to balance the acid level. Milk and Antacids literally eliminate ALL of the acid. And thats not something you want to do because the minute you eat, the body says "There is no acid, we better make some!" and huge levels of acid begins to flood your stomach resulting in heartburn. I would recommend deluting the vinegar to 1 tablespoon for every 8 oz glass of distilled or purified water. The reason? Well, vinegar is an acid! And much like Coca Cola can, it can erode tooth enamel. Its better to be safe. But if all else fails, there is a reason doctors exist!|`|3CXfqxcgaa	Apple cider vinegar|`|CE4K7kQvaa	HOM?OPATHIC TREATMENT(s) for INDIGESTION (Acid Reflux / Acidity / Gastralgia / IBS) :-<br>  <br>  Burning in food pipe with general sensation of burning Sulphur 30X 4 hourly<br>  <br>  Burning pain in stomach (Ulcer), with both water and solid vomited as soon as it reaches stomach Ars Alb.30X, 4 hourly <br>  <br>  Burning pain in the stomach, with water vomited but solid retained Bismuth 30X, 4 hourly <br>  <br>  Burning in food pipe,with sour stool Natrum Carb.30X, 4 hourly <br>  <br>  Excess of hydrochloric acid, burning in food pipe, heart burn, nausea and chilly feeling.

dpgXzMenaa	Women's genitals come in all shapes, sizes and colours... and they go through a lot of changes in all three during puberty.

KAnEq8Laaa	I understand where you're coming from, but cheer up: all is not lost. <br>  <br>  Maybe it's time to re-evaluate where the slips happened, and go back to the healthy eating skills you learned with WW. Also, it is important to realistically look at what the slips have caused: are you back to your pre-weight loss weight, or have you been steadily gaining a few pounds here and there? Or just a couple? Do you have regular activity as part of your daily life? <br>  <br>  We all go through good and bad periods, and nothing can make a person feel worse than achieving a goal and then seeing it seem to dissipate. I feel you. But what you do now is, you pick yourself up, look at the problem squarely, and realize: you are in control of you. Nobody is going to make you eat the wrong things--or the right ones,  for that matter. And when it comes right down to it, you have to allow yourself to be powerful enough to be in control of your own body and your own life and goals. You are not losing weight, eating healthily, and exercising for anybody but yourself. Sure, your family and friends can only benefit from a happy, healthy you; but in the end, you are your own driver. Know that. Be honest and kind to yourself, and understand that taking care of yourself is something that you have to do your whole life long--but that only you can do it, and while it's not easy sometimes, it's NOT impossible. Treat yourself nicely, be fair to yourself about the failings, and get back up on track. There are a lot of us who have been in your shoes, and I certainly know how you feel. But be strong, and you CAN get through the rough patches. Get support where you can--reaching out to your friends or maybe to some people you met in your WW meetings can really help you right now. And whatever you do, DO NOT beat yourself up. You haven't committed a crime--you've had a setback, and you can fix it for you. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that the failures and setbacks define you as a person, because they don't.<br>  <br>  I'm pulling for you.

d6Y9N2p1aa	"The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are: embryonic stem cells that are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells that are found in adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialized embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin or intestinal tissues."  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell</a><br>  <br>  So the good thing? stem cells can potentially produce any kind of cell, thus potentially be used to repair or regrow parts of our bodies - potentially. <br>  <br>  The bad? Adult stem cells tend to be specialized and cannot repair or create all types of cells, so embryonic are the most useful. These come from early in the reproductive process. Research into uses of adult stem cells isn't very controversial, its the embryonic ones that are, because to get them an embryo has to be destroyed.<br>  <br>  That's my understanding, based on a casual interest on the subject in order to better understand the ethics behind the issue.

I was glad to be off of them.|`|uaIUBYTcaa	It really depends on what birth control you are going to take. If you get the depo shot then it stops your period for 3 months. If you just take the pills then you still have your period. <br>  <br>  The pros of birth control are a less likely chance of getting pregnant, helps control period, and it helps cramps. <br>  <br>  I can't really think of any cons of birth control. I heard it is suppose to help with acne. Also I'm not sure if it can make your boobs shrink.
AEAxZEveaa	One place that mrsa hides is in your nose. Did they give you mupirocin to swab in your nose? That will make a difference. Are you doing the bleach baths? That will help too. Mrsa is terribly resistant. I hate to tell you, but you're being exposed to it all the time. Even if you get it to go away, you're touching doorknobs, countertops, money, and all kinds of surfaces that have bacteria and you will probably get reinfected again. I think the best thing you can do is make sure that you're taking care of yourself to make sure your immune system is up to par. I started eating healthier and exercising and found that I got sick much much less. And I hate to say it, but being around roomates who smoke is not good for your immune system. It's not the only factor, but I'm sure it plays a part in you getting infected so much. Oh, and get some health insurance. Not having health insurance can ruin your life.

VC7PyH53aa	160/61 is not real bad. Was the reading taken professionally? <br>  Morning, afternoon? Did you refrain from caffeine beforehand. <br>  Drinking coffee weeks,months, years before really wouldn't affect you now. Once the caffeine is out of the system your blood pressure would return to normal. <br>  <br>  I was always told the lower number is the more important one and that one is low. <br>  You may get nervous when your bp is taken which would cause the top number to soar. You might want to try one of the home monitors and take it multiple times during the day, see if it adjusts down when you're not stressed. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work you may be required to take some type of BP medication. That should not keep you out of the service.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|flKkoiwbaa	Drinking coffee did not give you high blood pressure.  Now, please take a deep breath and calm down . . . this will help your blood pressure more than you realize.<br>  <br>  Hypertension (the medical term for high blood pressure) is common among adults who are overweight and do not exercise.You are young and sound as though you are in good general health.  You are not overweight.  You exercise regularly.  All this is very much in your favor.<br>  <br>  Hypertension can be genetic, and can occur in young people such as yourself who are in good shape.   If this is the case, it is of paramount importance that it be diagnosed early to prevent future problems.<br>  <br>  However, it is very important that you realize that ONE elevated blood pressure reading does NOT mean that you have hypertension.  You need to monitor your blood pressure over time to see if your blood pressure is always high.<br>  <br>  Also, a reading of 160/61 is not "outstandingly high".  The bottom number - 61 (also called your "diastolic pressure") is actually quite good.  The top number - 160 (also called your "systolic pressure") is elevated.  For a young person like you, systolic pressure should be under 135.<br>  <br>  Systolic pressure can be increased by anxiety, stress, pain, and other transitory factors.  I'm guessing here, but maybe you were just a little anxious when your blood pressure was taken?  This could explain the elevation.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention if this was a physical with your regular doc or if it was through the air force, but you need to work with your doctor on this.  Monitor your blood pressure (you can purchase a BP monitor or make a regular stop by your local pharmacy, wal-mart, etc, they usually have a BP machine you can use for free).  Take your BP at different times during the day and keep a log for your doctor.  Take your BP once or twice a day at the most - not every 10 minutes!  The idea is to get a picture of what your BP averages.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, RELAX!.  Many people get seriously freaked out and anxious about this, causing their BP to skyrocket everytime they put that BP cuff on!   I've worked both in a doctor's office and in the ER and I've seen this phenomenon many a time.   <br>  <br>  Eat healthy.  Try to avoid excess salt and make sure your diet is rich in potassium, which is helpful in maintaining good BP.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck to you!|`|Hz94L5b5aa	I don't think that the coffee from years past would have anything to do with it. If you consume a regular amount, every day as a regimen then that should have nothing to do with it. <br>  <br>  High blood pressure can run in families. Check with your family and see if it does run in the line. If so, talk to your Dr. about medication. <br>  <br>  Try exercising. Exercising will lower your heart rate as your heart will "learn" to pump blood more efficiently, due to gaining strength (your heart is muscle too). <br>  <br>  Keep an eye on your diet. Some foods that are high in sugar and fats can raise your blood pressure by having colesterol build on your veins and arteries.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	Your blood pressure reading of 160/061 mm Hg is almost certainly in error.  Medical studies have consistently shown that readings taken by both physicians and nurses are inaccurate 20 to 25% of the time - but I suspect that this is a very low estimate - and that the truth is much worse.  Consumption of one cup of coffee daily will have no influence on the blood pressure unless you drank it within 30 minutes of having the blood pressure reading taken.  Blood varies considerably during the course of the day.  Based upon more than 200 ambulatory studies of blood pressure it has been determined that the difference between the lowest and highest reading of the day may vary by as much as 50/25 mm Hg.  What is particularly curious about your reading is the difference between the systolic (top number) and the diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure.  A difference of 100 mm Hg simply does not occur in a 19 year old individual.  There are a great many reasons why blood pressure readings are too often inaccurate.  Neither physicians nor nurses are typically taught how to take a blood pressure article properly.  Nikolai Korotkoff in 1905 described 5 sounds that may be heard when taking a blood pressure.  K1 is the systolic blood pressure and K5 is the diastolic blood pressure.  From 1905 through the 1970s the proper technique for recording a blood pressure was emphasized in medical training.  The late Jules Constant, M.D. wrote several marvelous articles on how to take a blood pressure properly.  I have written an article on how to take a blood pressure properly and I would be pleased to send it to you but if you do not have some medical background it may be confusing to you.  Some of the factors that influence the blood pressure is the time of day, whether or not you were rushed or stress, consumption of caffeine or smoking within the 30 minutes before the reading, whether or not you were seated for 10 to 15 minutes in the examination room prior to taking the blood pressure (which is virtually never the case), whether the blood pressure was taken with you sitting on an examination table (which tends to falsely elevate blood pressure by 10 mm Hg or more) or whether you were seated in a chair especially a chair with an arm rest (which improves the accuracy of the reading), how and where the blood pressure cuff was placed around the arm (the center of the 'bladder' within the cuff not the center of the cuff itself should be placed over the crease of the arm known as the antecubital fossa), how quickly the cuff was inflated, how quickly the cuff was deflated, and the quality of the stethoscope used to take the reading.  There are even more variables than this but the above should give you some idea why so few blood pressure readings are accurate.  Many medical articles have stated that among the tests performed most commonly the blood pressure is the one that is most commonly incorrect.  Again - the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a young healthy person simply cannot approximate 100 mm Hg and this alone states that the blood pressure of 160/061 mm Hg was not accurate.

fAFXkikAaa	50% to 80% of adults have oral herpes.  It is usually caught in childhood from kissing relatives and is NOT an STD.<br>  <br>  Also, herpes is almost always spread through skin-to-skin contact.  If he does not have an active cold sore then it is EXTREMELY unlikely that he would spread oral herpes through sharing drinks or utensils.  In fact, even if he DOES have an active outbreak, the virus dies quite quickly away from the human body.<br>  <br>  With these things in mind, if he truly is one of your best friends, then I would suggest keeping the confidence that he has shared with you.   Keeping embarrassing secrets, shared in confidence, is an important part of being a good friend.<br>  <br>  If you feel very strongly that you need to warn people about a disease that is not an STD and that almost everyone will eventually get, then be prepared to lose him as a friend.   I know that if I had shared confidential, embarrassing medical information with a close friend, and they felt the need to tell other people "to protect them,"  I would find better friends.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents.|`|fk9AvB25aa	I'm assuming the the herpes is on his mouth...As long as he doesn't have an out break at the time he is doing those things then there is less of a risk of spreading it. As long as you don't kiss him when he has an out break then there is not much of a chance that you would get it. <br>  No you should not tell other people, let him do that. If you told other people then he would get upset at you for telling them because your supposed to support him.<br>  If he dates another girl then HE should be the one to tell her. If she hears it from you she may not believe you. Also you don't want to be spreading that info around, people with herpes have a rough enough time being accepted. Would you want him telling the world you have herpes....Some people are very open about it and there are those who would rather not have the whole world know about it. If he told you then obviously he trusted you enough to keep that confidential.|`|t3w3cDduaa	I think you should tell his other girlfriend... But I have a friend who has oral herpes and she knows when and when not to share drinks and stuff like that with people.  So, yea, tell the girl but not EVERYBODY.|`|2wMMAKpOaa	Yes. Herpes can definitely be spread from sharing drinks, cigarettes, etc. If I were you I would talk to him about it and try to convince him not to do these things but if he refuses to tell the people and continue to do it then yes I would deff tell. I wouldn't wish herpes on anyone.|`|nIBDa9yCaa	Yes, I think that is the good choice.|`|7gcdOCbtaa	What a great friend you are. He shares something in confidence and you go on the web-site to blab it.hmmmmmmmmm.........<br>  <br>  He needs to take care of this his-self. He needs to Man Up and go to the Dr. ask all kinds of questions about it.(Get literature & condoms .)Example:<br>  <br>  1. Is it Herpes 1 which is on the lips or face? Alot of people have this as it is also called a cold sore.The same meds. can be taken for this as in #2.<br>  <br>   2. If he has it on his manly parts he can take oral medication for  a week or 2 (again his Dr. will know) in the form of a pill.During this time he should not have sex (it should hurt him where he doesn't even want to).<br>  <br>   3. HE SHOULD ALWAYS TELL HIS PARTNER BEFORE THEY HAVE SEX as she/he needs to decide if she/he wants to live the rest of her/his life with this.If so, then he should always wear a condom on his penis..As far as oral sex goes it should also be her/his choice. I wouldn't ever have oral sex with him.Then again I'm a lot vain when it comes to my face and getting that stage herpes.<br>  <br>   4.Tell him to look up on yahoo today's story about a man who was sued for having sex with a woman because he did not tell her he had herpes and she got it from him.SHE WON 7 MILLION DOLLARS.<br>  <br>   5. WHO KNOWS , HE COULD BE GROWING UP IN JU VE... or worse in jail .<br>  <br>  Let him handle this with YOUR BEING A CONCERNED FRIEND WHICH IS GREAT .HOWEVER TELL HIM IF HE DOESN"T SHARE THIS with  his g.f/b.f.<br>  that YOU WILL HAVE TO .Offer your support to also go with him to The Dr. I'm sure he's scared .
AA10551261	Why hasn't anyone ever heard of this?  If it's so safe and it worked you would see lots of people getting it done. It would be as common as a nose job or botox.

Once you have your own practice, you'll be fine because you'll be able to cater your services to your abilities.  The hardest part will be clinical rotations and residency. <br>  <br>  What are your MS symptoms?  Do you have walking trouble?

You can be a Dr. and be in a wheelchair.  At Duke University I saw this little dwarf guy that was a Dr. and he could barely walk.  I'm sure he had to stand up on a stool or whatever to reach the patients.  So you can be a Dr. and have all kinds of disabilities.|`|hBR3jIxsaa	Absolutely!  Don't let anything stop you of your dream.  Think positive and pursuit it.  Your symptoms are mild and keep your stress down and they will stay that way and you will do well.|`|ckuhgjWGaa	Yes.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	Basically bacteria have a limited genome, and resistance typically takes up space on that genome.  That means that bacteria without resistance have more space on the genome for stuff involved in pathogenesis (being more infectious), such as adhesion, movement, nutrition, cell defense, etc.  In an environemnt without antibiotic stimulation, the bacteria that is more pathogenic is the one that is going to win out, since it's more suited for it.<br>  <br>  Kind of like riding around in a tank vs a normal car...in a war zone the tank is obviously going to do better, but just for normal purposes, the car is much more efficient.|`|7959WbC2aa	If you fell ill and the resistant strains were out-competing, the antibiotic would have no effect.

I got my period when i was 12, and i would ger 2 peroids a month for the longest time. I had my first child last April & my periods now come like clock work every month.

2wMMAKpOaa	There is a lower chance, but yes it can still be spreaded by saliva. Even if you didn't swallow his spit everytime you kissed, you were still swapping saliva unknowingly. Now the chances are higher that you could have contracted HIV is if you had some type of sore or something in your mouth. It usually takes around 3 months for it to show up on tests though. So I would deff get tested in due time.|`|t3w3cDduaa	No.|`|Np0Y3vUCaa	There have been rare cases of people contracting the HIV virus from kissing and saliva wasn't the cause. Keep in mind this is highly unlikely, the odds are ridiculously low. If you feel nervous or uncertain, than you can always be tested. This is something you should do if you have had multiple partners anyhow, not just a suspicious encounter. You can always ask your gyne to run a test at your next check up. Again, the chances are EXTREMELY low. People get pricked by needles used on HIV positive patients and the infection rate is still low. The virus is one of all body fluid so it is technically in saliva, mucous, vaginal secretions, semen, blood and others. Saliva however is perhaps the lowest of those in infection risk due to inhibition of the virus.|`|421b2fb60081b51b56d2f694ad49b8ceaa	Well, as a nurse there is very small concentraction of the HIV virus in saliva and kissing. However, if you drank high volumes of saliva then your chances increase. The only way to know is get tested and be safe.|`|ORjvX1Byaa	NO unless there was blood or you drank gallons of his spit
xav4i5zkaa	you can eat as soon as your unfrozen, the only thing is your mouth doesnt open as wide because of the stitches.

Very very small bites, and after an hour i finally managed a full slice :)<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|2RInFX4Qaa	Rice is bad it can go inside your socket. Ice Cream/Smoothies/Soup/Mash Potatoes Are good. No Soda/alcohol.<br>  It Sucks But you'd rather be healthy? The Day After I Eat, I recommend you eat a big meal before you go to the dentist.|`|PjyP8yEiaa	No drinking alcohol or smoking for the first 24hrs.(no hard rinsing, or sucking through straws either) I drank ensure shakes, ice cream shakes, popsicles and jello the first day to day and a half. After that I started with soups at room temp. Try to eat soft foods and nothing that will require too much chewing. (since you will be sore most likely) Just keep in mind not to disturb the clots, doing so will leave you with dry socket which is extremely painful. Just try to remember keep it light and also that everyone is different.
8SbKEkBKaa	It depends what's causing it. Try milk, Tums, or Maalox. If they don't help then do the opposite and try vinegar.

M7pYK1rJaa	YES! It is very common. The estrogen in the pills makes them sore. Your breasts will probably grow a bit - between 1/2 - 2 sizes (it depends.

After a few months they'll quit growing, and thus quit being sore (other than right around your period). :)|`|h0nfy6VXaa	It depends on the pill, but most of them can cause swelling and tenderness in the breast.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Birth control pills are Synthetic Hormone Therapy.  They affect the endocrine that is a system of complex relationships and when you have a problem with one of the organs in that system, it affects them all.  The hypothalamus gland is responsible for monitoring and dealing with "feed back loops" from hormones in the body.  When you take birth control pills, these feed back loops are altered and causes lots of problems with the endocrine system.  Many women experience weight gain, for instance, while on the pill.  The thyroid gland is part of the endocrine system.  This weight gain issue is your body reacting to this problem. <br>  <br>  You need to understand that the FDA is not our friend and drug companies do NOT care about your health, only profit.  Doctors are agents of the drug companies and provide you with drugs that will give you "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH."  When the birth control pill was released to the public, the incidence of Breast Cancer went way up.  Drug companies spend several years defending the pill and then they reduced the hormone levels in them and the breast cancer levels went down, but not to the same lower level they were before the pill.  <br>  <br>  The liver is definitely a victim in this hormone battle.  The liver makes steroid hormones (sex hormones) and does so from the fat you eat.  If you are on a low fat diet, low salt, you will have a low libido problem.  Pregnenalone is a precursor hormone that is required to make the steroid hormones and it is made from the fat you eat.  If you are eating lots of carbs, this will give you an excess of glucose in your blood and cause insulin & glucagon spikes, resulting in your adrenal glands producing cortisol (the stress hormone).  Since cortisol is made from the precursor, pregnenalone, your body prioritizes the production of cortisol first, before sex hormones.  This is called the "pregnenalone steal."  If you are not getting enough sleep at night (you need at least 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep) to give you a good REM sleep mode at least once, your adrenal glands are not getting recharged. <br>  <br>  If you are eating or drinking lots of caffeine, you are exhausting your adrenal glands further.  All this contributes heavily to the low libido.  Also, if you are eating unfermented soy products, like tofu, especially, this will give you a low libido.<br>  <br>  New mothers are especially vulnerable to the low fat issue because babies require lots of fat.  Their diet should contain about 55% fat.  Most women are deficient in essential fatty acids in America today and this is why most children are getting ear aches as infants and lots of neurological problems like ADD and ADHD, etc.  This lunacy about saturated fats being promoted by the ignorant is rampant and causing lots of problems in America today, especially with children.  <br>  <br>  The mood swings you are having is most likely due to hormone imbalances caused by the endocrine problem.  One of the other issues with not getting enough of the right fats in your diet and too many carbs is the reconjugation of estrogen is thwarted.  <br>  <br>  All this is causing the problem with libido you are having.  Forget about asking doctors about this situation because they are NOT informed about nutrition and their advice on hormones is really pitiful.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest you seek out a Certified Nutritional Therapist that can put you on the road to health.  The problem you are having is not that difficult to solve, but you need some good solid advice.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|S8H5yYcoaa	It sounds like you're particularly sensitive to hormonal contraceptives.  Have you thought about an IUD?  While the new IUC on the market (Mirena) is hormonal, copper-based IUDs are spermicidal and work with your uterus's local chemistry to harden the uterine lining (as far as I can tell) rather than effecting global hormonal changes to prevent pregnancy.  They are about as effective as hormonal birth control, hassle-free after the initial insertion (you'll want to check occasionally that the strings are still there so you know it's still in place, but no need to remember anything on a real schedule like a pill regimen does), and last up to 10 years but are removable at any time in case you decide to have another child.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|Lr3lZ4draa	have you tried the Depo?

I used to be concerned about this making it so that I'm not doing either exercise well, but it has been working for me. You feel so tired after it that you'll KNOW it'll only yield good results. I don't really have any suggestions on lifting, but I oftentimes try to combine the exercises into coherent groups. For example, most of my workouts are geared towards improving my outdoor adventures, so between those short runs, I'll do some squats and some pullups to simulate a rock climb, or some rows and biceps to simulate a kayak ride. I don't know if any exercise physiologists have done any studies on this, but I like the idea of synchronizing muscles that would be used together outside the gym.<br>  <br>  On the days that I don't lift, I will usually have a dedicated cardio workout where I can go on a longer run, ride a bike, swim, etc. These are much simpler: just go out and do it. If I am feeling fancy, I will do an interval workout in the morning (multiple cycles of 30 second sprint + 60 second job) and then do a long run after I get home in the evening.

PRZAeWgoaa	I am no expert, however I got pregnant with my son at 16 (unprotected sex) then had my daughter at 18. As for your problem, there may have been some left over  dried blood inside of you since you just finished your period. If you continue to spot I would see a doctor, especially if there is an odor. As for unprotected sex, these days it is pretty scary. I know I did alot of stupid things in my life, however now with all the diseases out there (things I can't even pronounce) I'm not willing to compromise myself anymore unless I know he is God sent. I suggest using comdoms for the first year and get tested every three months for AIDS and STD's. If this person refuses they may be hiding something. Really getting to know someone for awhile may seem old fashioned but it might save your life. Make sure the guy or girl walks like they talk. Watch there actions and if you catch them in lies that should be a red flag as to cheating. Better to be safe than sorry or dead. God bless you|`|4TmcopjUaa	It could be an infection that is totally curable.  You may have been sore and not realized and the friction from sex aggravated it.  It may be a yeast infection.  Go to the drug store and pick up a Monistat.  If the ailment is still there after the Monistat, contact your doctor.  However, use your better judgement, if it seems serious right now and has you worried, go to the doctor or health department tomorrow!  I read the post about douching-be very careful of doing this-this can harm your body just as much as it can cleanse it.  Not good to make a habit of either!  Use with caution-this was advised by my gyno.|`|6xOu8xXCaa	You need to douche.  Sounds like a mixture of blood and sperm.  Why aren't you using protection anyway?

ccyqb0v3aa	I'm so sorry to hear you've been having a rough time.  And I'm glad you are at a point where you realize you are looking for comfort in the wrong places.  When you lose those you love, or don't feel like you can trust those you love most, it is not unusual for people to turn to sex to fill those emotional voids.  Now that you realize this is not the healthiest response to your stress, you need to stop.  It seems more complicated then that, but its not really.  Tell this guy that you've been stressed out which has caused you to do things you normally wouldn't do and you think he's great and all....but end it.  And stop.  You are very young and don't want the emotional scars that empty sexual relationships can leave behind, and certainly don't want to end up pregnant.  If you have to, beg your parents to go to a new church.  Just tell them you can't relate to the kids there and need a new start and really need a church family right now with everything going on.  Find good girlfriends you can rely on and spend time with them just relaxing, without all the pressure of a romantic relationship.  Tell your parents you're having a tough time with their divorce and would like to talk to a counselor -- or go to your school counselor and ask for help.  That's what they are there for, and I promise you that they have heard it all before.  As scary as it sounds, you might want to tell your parents.  It might be awful for awhile, but "grounding" you might be just what you need to keep you away from him, get back on a good path, and alert your parents to the fact they need to focus a little more on how their choices are impacting you.  You shouldn't be dealing with all of these things alone - that is a lot for anyone to handle, let alone a 13 year old.  Best of luck to you.|`|qVNSMkYlaa	wow what a church i want to join|`|1JsWMX0daa	it sounds like you should know to turn to Jesus. and that is not corney. my life has sucked big time but Jesus keeps me going. remember, Jesus had a sucky human life so that we could find strength through him. He knew hunger very well cause he fasted. He was betrayed by a good friend, humiliated in front of his friends, mother, and many strangers, harassed, made fun of, tortured, frustrated, and crucified and killed. He also promises that if you believe in him that one day he will wipe every tear away, quench your thirst for justice, & reward your good deeds and faith. turn to Jesus. he will comfort you. whenever you need to;<br>   shout it within your heart:<br>  <br>   Lord Jesus Be My Strength And My Way!|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	First of all I'm not judging you. You do have to realize that sex has consequences, and not necessarily for the better. You're having a tough time, and attention from anyone makes you feel validated and worthwhile.<br>      If sexual pleasure helps you feel less stressed, then try masturbation. At least you won't have some clumsy guy fumbling around, trying to find the "sweet spot." <br>      There are serious consequences for a girl having sex. Please don't let all the adult b******* set the tone for the rest of your life. You're far too young to be a mother, or being promiscuous. You are NOT messed up. Yet. You are showing a maturity beyond your years by posting this question and I would hope that you can deal with your stress by pleasing yourself. <br>  <br>    Wait a few years before you actually do it. You'll be far more aware of what gives you pleasure; and it will help any relationship in your future. It'll be worth it.|`|d2HmBxKUaa	what are you asking?|`|cXXJVz64aa	You need some love and attention and you THINK you are getting it by having sex. Sex does not involve love in your case. Talk to your parents because they are needing love and attention, also. They are all having a difficult time right now. Stop the sex before you end up pregnant! Hold your mom and give her the love she needs.|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	OMG!!
rurfFLDkaa	they cut to distract themselves from the emotional pain and make them focus on the physical pain. to kill urself u cut down ur arm. just to cut, you cut accross ur arm. im sure theyre so mentally messed up that they have no self respect and dont get nervous when they cut. no i dont reccoment it. it turns you into a raging pussy. and by the way, you dont hide this kind of stuff. theres a girl that sits next to me in my 6th period and she has cuts all over her arms. its discusting. go lift some weights or something. its a lot more effective trust me|`|hDWaxGgDaa	I have cut myself. I have a mood regulation disorder (which my doctors think may be bipolar disorder) so I have real highs and lows and to try to relieve myself of not feeling so well I have cut myself. It helps temporarily, but doesn't solve the problem. I've used pretty much any type of sharp object to self harm. I certainly don't recommend cutting because it becomes an addiction and overcoming it is very hard. Honestly it is hard to hide, I am a swimmer and have had kids notice the scars on my stomach and ask me about them. I do my best to keep my stomach covered, but it isn't always possible. I am working on overcoming cutting right now, and it's hard, but I know I will be better off and feel better if I stop. I'd suggest talking to a trusted adult (your parents, a school counselor, a teacher, a clergy member etc) about what you are going through so they can get you some help. Good Luck!|`|1BSGKxQEaa	It depends on the person. For one it might "help" by releaving stress, or other emotions. It might help you get your mind of something. It might be done when your angry, and you dont know what to do, so you end up taking out your anger on your own body. How do you cut. Thats simple. Me, i use a razor. [i break a disposable shaving razor so im just left with the razor itself] Simple press it to your skin, and slide it across as fast as you can. Dont i get nervous. Uhm, Not anymore. The first time, I will tell you i was scared to death, but it just kind of happened. And once i had made the cut, i remember thinking to myself, "that wasnt so bad". Would i reccomend it. I wouldnt because you will be left with scars, But it helps me, so why not someone else. If it helps you go ahead. I know its helped me. Email me if you want more information, i guess.|`|cXXJVz64aa	Cutting is a very dangerous habit. It is the cause of a mental disorder. See a doctor and discuss this before you start. Most cutters end up in a mental hospital.|`|sBcf9Dz6aa	Yes cutting is proven to make you some what happyer. I dont cut but it hurts like hell. The blood releases a chemical makeing the psin some what less.|`|fQAjPXPAaa	Who the hell would recommend a disorder?<br>  Get some help.|`|voTyeJexaa	it depends on what you consider "help."<br>  for some, its a stress reliever. for others, it lets out emotional/mental pain they cannot express, through physical pain. for some, it actually releases endorphines, which generally cause happiness. and, for all, whether they realize it or not right away, its their way of calling out for help. <br>  you cut with whatever you find. knives, razors, pins, glass...it can be whatever. and it does hurt. but its different for everyone, depending on your threshold for pain.<br>  it depends on the perosn if they get nervous or not.<br>  No, i dont reccommend it. It can be a hard habit to kick if you become dependent on it for stress relief or any of the other reasons i stated above. It's also physically dangerous (depending on how you cut, where and how badly and with what you cut). it scars (also depending on how, where, what you cut with) and it makes friends and family intensely worried about you, and it can cause massive confusion and upset with those people because if they dont understand, its a good way to start a fight about wanting to put you away with a thorzine drip, because most people who see cutters immediately think that person is suicidal, when most of the time they ARENT.<br>  by the questions you are asking, it sounds like you ARE curious about doing it. please dont. it scared the crap out of my friends, and i'll have the scars for the rest of my life to remind me everyday of when i did it.<br>  <br>  hope i helped =]|`|YXnq4AtVaa	look, iv been cutting for about a year now. NO it does not help you but for some (like me) it can feel like a releaf of pain you feel inside. i cut on my legs, and just every where, it doesn't matter where. no i dont get nervous because its not even me thinking. its just a quick idea in my head, it happends and then after i think to myself "what the hell did i do" noooo i would never recomend it. its horrible and a bad habbit. my friends found out and they all act weird around me. please if you were planing on cutting or kno anyone who cuts, help them!

euHZPsQYaa	I'm, oddly enough, doing a presentation on cochlear implants for my psychology perception class. I don't know if you're congenital or not, but if you could hear before, sounds are wildly different using a CI than actual human hearing.<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of it depends on age as well. There is a correlation between age of the patient and the success of the device. The older you, the less successful it will be in terms of speech and what not. Speech being such a complex sound and all. Literally, just went over all this stuff in class.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Young children do really well because of the brains ability to adapt. Speaking of, if you're congenitally deaf, the auditory cortex might have been overwritten to perform some other function, so it's going to be difficult even still.<br>  <br>  Ooh, and if you could email me as well, I have some questions I would like to ask you, but they might be a little sensitive.I can include it as a first-hand source for my presentation on Cochlear Implants. (email is in my profile)
ScXcnZiUaa	Yes you should definitely go to the doc.  If its a fracture and doesn't get treated you could end up needing surgery to fix it in the long run.<br>  <br>  If its a sprain that isn't treated properly(meaning by a doctor, not your parents!!!) then you could end up with long term tendon and ligament damage, as well as pain and weakness that could last forever.
aEKI1Knqaa	Only if you are being seen by your primary doctor for smoking related issues. If not, don't say anything. The reason is that if you are hospitalized for any reason and need to have an emergency procedure, you will not be a candidate for surgery. Any patient who is known to have used drugs in the past will not be considered for any type of emergency procedure. I'm just being honest.<br>  Chances are you will never be in that position but, your medical records are with you until the day you die. If someone happens to look in your records and see that you had used marijuana in the past, you are automatically disqualified from certain procedures. I don't understand why it works that way but, it does. And the same does not apply to people who abuse alcohol, tobacco and prescription drugs. They can still get transplants, transfusions, etc. Doesn't make sense. If you keep quiet and don't say anything, nobody is harmed. You will most likely never be drug tested in the hospital because they only drug test people who are known to be addicts. So you will still be a candidate for whatever you may be in need of.|`|00sn8G9paa	One person you don't want to lie to is the doctor. He's not allowed to share info anyway. Besides, he probably rolls one or two once in a while anyway.|`|exMPHWKHaa	Yes there is patient confidentiality they cannot share this information with anyone. I have told all my doctors that I use marijuana. I have asked my doctor about medical marijuana too but honestly most doctors today are pretty ignorant on the topic. I'm suffering from a lot of things and use marijuana to help self medicate also. I would really prefer to have it prescribed to me but its hard to do so where I live in Maine. Good luck to you. EDIT: Ah I see what you mean well just make sure to tell him how you use it for its medical properties. Go into detail if you must.|`|2JTBPhuuaa	If it's relevant then mention it, as long as you're not the typical drug seeker he'll understand. Most doctors know the truth about marijuana. If you reside in California defenitely tell him so you can get the medical marijuana process started.
2WWEn2mZaa	They obviously do not fit properly. How long has she had them? If they are dentures that she has had for some time then the gums do shrink and cause the dentures to flop about. She needs to get dentures that fit right. If that is not possible get some denture cream then they will stick to her gum and not have that annoying flopping about.|`|6xOu8xXCaa	She may need new dentures.  They could be loose and you're hearing the suction sound between the denture and the upper roof of her mouth.
Hq6nSl1Qaa	It's quazi evil.  It's the margarine of evil.  It's the Diet Coke of evil.  There aren't a lot of white molds that produce the neurotoxins that black mold does.  For a small area, some bleach water whetted with a couple drops of soap will work for your purposes.  Make sure that you get rid of any drywall within a foot of the standing water level.  That can carry over spores pretty easily.  Make sure to use a brush to move spores/bleach around.|`|92T6OdWBaa	White mold isnt very bad, whereas black mold can cause death. If you released the spores run like hell, and wash immediately. Bleach or ammonia can kill all types of mold instantly. Remember white= pennacillin and mushrooms, black= death.<br>  <br>  *edit- white mold is bad, but not nearly as bad as black.<br>  *edit #2- mold spores are released by contact, take a spray bottle 1/2 water, 1/2 bleach (or ammonia (NOT both)) and spray affected areas. If its insulated or drywalled its all garbage, tear it all out, throw away. Wear a respirator while doing any of this.|`|SsfnitjXaa	For the most part it depends on the person... how allergic they are to mold. There are some black molds that are very toxic.  <br>  <br>  You don't need 100% bleach.  You will be overcome if you use bleach full strength.  How big of an area are you talking?|`|slHUNl58aa	Dave is absolutely right.
ccyqb0v3aa	That's a horrible situation - I'm sorry you're going through that.  At some point, enough is enough, and yet you don't want to abandon your child when they need you most. . . <br>  <br>  I'd look for a long-term rehab program and express your concerns of repeat behavior to them.  Is he financially dependent on you or does he have a job?  You might cut him off financially so that he cannot afford the drugs.  YOu might find a way to make him submit to drug tests every so many days and make that conditional upon him staying.  If you have church counsel or a therapist, or both, I'd consult them both.  This is a difficult time for all and as much advice is needed as possible.  Just try to surround him with positive people who will reach out to him and try to motivate him to be a better person.  Do all you can to remove the bad/negative influences and people from his life.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there is no easy answer.  My heart goes out to you.|`|r3ke7uonaa	This is difficult and I don't have any kids of my own.  Kicking him out will help you and your wife somewhat, but, seeing as how he's OD'ed 3 times already, you'll both probably worry more if he's out of the house.  Obviously, you can't force anyone into treatment; it has to be either their idea or the idea of the courts.  If you do decide to kick him out, I agree with the written contract idea that way nothing can be disputed.  I would also give some type of consequence such as, out of the house by this time on this date or else the police will be called, or something along those lines.  Heroin is a serious drug and I know your son needs help, but taking action will prove to him that you will no longer enable him or his addiction.  If worse comes to worse, you could always turn him into the police station.  I know it's a bit evasive and harsh, but he will probably get the help he needs whether it be court mandated treatment (methadone or suboxen) or jail time (depending on your state laws about illicit use).  What ever the outcome, I wish you and your wife the best of luck.|`|AA11788494	I would do the intervention.  If he fails once again, try a methadone clinic.  It works wonders and is legal.  It is expensive and it is still a drug but a person can function on it as long as they don't get too high of a dose.  My ex husband did this and it saved his life.  I don't particularly like some effects of the medicine but it works to some extent.  In the long run it is just another addiction, but it is legal and monitored.  It is for heroin addicts.  Most people don't get treatment because of the cost.  Plus the patients can get kicked out of the program if they fail a urine test.  It can be deadly if mixed with some nerve medications.  The clinic will go over all of that information with you though.  My ex was on heroin for 12 years and kicked the habit with ease when he started the clinic.  I am not saying it is a great thing but it was the best choice for him because rehabs did not work for him.  He could not take the physical withdrawals and gave up on the third day every time he went to rehab.|`|9mdLmJHWaa	no. heroin is physically very addictive. most other drugs are mentally addictive only.<br>  <br>  it is not his fault. the best course of action is rehab, there is nothing else you can do. if you stop letting him take more heroin, he could die. in rehab, they have better ways to make you quit taking heroin; and better than yours im sure. but quitting heroin is always a risk, that risk is greatly reduced by rehab.|`|YCrivHOUaa	well, since everyone else has said What i was gonna say, i would also do a little research on heroin, like the damage it can do and stuff (especially the most painful/gruesome stuff), print it out and show it to him. pretty much what i'm saying is a little shock therapy, before you do anything really drastic.|`|YM03OVi8aa	You know what they say, One has to truely hit the bottom before they want to change the error of there ways. When will he hit the bottom? In a drastic case he'll never reach the bottom, if you know what i mean he'll "skip" it in other words, and go to the undesired level.|`|zmVg3Q3Caa	Research into a Intervention program in your area.

THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR YOU ,BUT I RECOMMEND YOU SEEK A GROUP CALLED AL ANON. THEY ARE A SUPPORT GROUP FOR FAMILY MEMBERS THAT MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU DEAL WITH THIS. DON'T DENY YOUR SON THE PAIN HE NEEDS TO MAKE CHANGE IN HIS LIFE, AND DON'T CONTINUE TO SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THAT KIND OF TORTURE.|`|voTyeJexaa	thats a really hard question.<br>  my teacher's daughter was really really addicted to heroin, and then crystal meth. they gave her a million chances and she kept skipping rehab and counseling, and getting involved with the wrong people. they did kick her out eventually because they said they couldnt enable her, and she needed to get her act together. she did, and shes recovering a year later.<br>  <br>  id give your son a set time. a week maybe. to me, 24 hours is pretty drastic and unexpected. tell him he has a week (or however much time you think is appropriate) to decide hes gonna get help, quit, or not quit, and get out. you cannot enable him. you also have to remember, as painful as it is for you and your wife im sure to see your son like this, you cant change him. you can help up to a certain point, but after that its up to him. you can always look into an intervention, but they are MAD expensive. we looked into one for my alcoholic best friend over the summer. cheapest one was $4000. he isnt going to change or get help unless HE wants to. so keeping him under your roof isnt helping. if hes a minor, or even if he isnt, if you REALLY wanna force him to get help, you can go through the court process, but that will be ugly and will probably really hurt your relationship with him. so, give him a set amount of time, be calm about it. dont yell at him and tell him this, but be firm and stern and serious. if the time comes and he hasnt decided to get help and hes gotta leave, be this way too. dont fight or yell. anyway, give him a set amount of time to get help or change. and if he doesnt comply, i guess you have no other choice. if he has to leave you can always try to get him a little help, but not enough to again, enable him. maybe give him an idea or some references of places to live, if he can get a job, but hes gonna need to do it on his own.<br>  <br>  its sad...im very sorry for you and your wife....i hope i helped though.<br>  good luck to you all<br>  <3 and i hope he gets better|`|AA12327015	Give him your unconditional love.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Is boot camp an option?

KcDRAWrtaa	People say more sleep makes you feel better, but it doesn't. it makes you feel really groggy. If you feel tired throughout the day, if you're not too busy with your aunt, try to take half hour naps. people also say that naps should be around 2 hours or so. This also makes you feel worse because you just want to sleep MORE. At night you should sleep no more than 9 hours. it should be restful, not restless. naps should be about 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  When you wake up in the morning make sure to stretch. stretching alone will get the blood flowing around your body to help wake you up. also, wash your face as soon as you wake up. both of these get your brain working!|`|cUhcsEcGaa	6.30 hour for better for sleep.

Z81bOxq7aa	Len is correct.<br>   Did you just do this? If so make sure that the area you burnt is not still warm to the touch as compared to the other arm, if it is put very cool compress on it. (a clean cloth with cold water will do) this will take any remaining burn out of the skin & will feel better to. Burns will actually keep burning until they are cooled, which is why you DO NOT put creams or lotions on burns. They keep the heat in & the dermis & epidermis can continue to be damaged. Sometimes something that doesn't look to bad really can be, the best thing to put on it is a Telfa Pad which is a dressing specifically made for burns, it will not stick to the skin as it is healing as it is coasted with a plastic type layer, while still allowing the area to breathe. Keep an eye on it & if in doubt or if it does not seem to be healing go see Your Doctor.<br>  JTM&AB|`|ymrkxCGdaa	I did the same thing (except sliding my arm on a hot vinyl-coated chain link fence), and it looked exactly liked you described it. I don't remember doing anything to it except dealing with the pain. I didn't cover it with anything to protect it from exposure to whatever's in the environment. I might have doused my arm in cold water, which probably helped... Aside from that, I just let it heal over time. It became more of a scab in a few days, and healed into just an ugly scar within two months or so. I can still see it today, over a year and a half later, so be ready to have a mark on your arm for quite a while. Sorry I couldn't be of much use...|`|KRgfXsFtaa	Cover it and keep it clean.

So just wait and ask for an ultra sound to check if everything is ok with the ovaries and what not.|`|CJeufMTWaa	Yes, it does sound like a hormonal imbalance.  If the doctor you went to is not willing to look into it, then go to another doctor.  They may want to put you on birth control pills to regulate your period.

dwLqreuvaa	I hadn't had any tooth extractions ever but i do have some knowledge on the topic, :)<br>  <br>  1) The procedure depends on the dentist, it usually is about 20 minutes per tooth, but that also counts with the freezing, inspecting the mouth so in your case i would expect about around an hour or more<br>  <br>  2) Everybody is different, you can expect to stay home if vomitting acured at the time of wisdom tooth extraction. You will have to just wait and see, <br>  <br>  3) Yes cheek and jaw pain is to be expected. Your jaw will feel stiff, remember your tooth is being pulled from its socket, there will be some pain involved. To reduce swelling, i would try some ice, and to reduce jaw stiffness i would use a warm compress<br>  <br>  4) It is very important not to use a straw, while eating food, this can pull out a blood clot and cause a dry socket. (this includes no smoking) eat cool and soft food, like pasta, ice cream, yadda yadda. <br>  <br>  About the bracket, dont worry much about it, just try and floss around it to get like food chunks out, keep it clean<br>  <br>  5) The pain, this depends on everyone again. But i would say that, the actual operation will not hurt, but the follow up will hurt. So you can ask your dentist various questions for more information,<br>  <br>  As for braces, again the putting it on does not hurt (there may be discomfort but not alot of pain) so you will feel pressure, but probably the night or a couple of hours after you get your braces it will hurt. So try and take advil or tylenol to ease your pain<br>  <br>  Hope i helped, heres a link i found for you for more info|`|iynxbd9Daa	1. it took my dentist only about 10 minutes to take 2 of my teeth out. it was quite quick and painless.<br>  2. your supposed to rest for the next 24 hours after you have your teeth removed.<br>  3. not really, it really depends on who you are, but they shouldnt.<br>  4. your notsupposed to eat hot food so maybe warm soup or ice-cream   =)<br>  5. i would rate the pain during the procedure a 0 out of ten beacuse of the numbness of my mouth because of the anesthesia they give you.

C3akCffCaa	Okay...making yourself sick or starving yourself doesn't help you lose weight. In the end you eat no matter what and you actually gain weight from starving yourself cause it will soak up EVERYTHING you eat(as if you only eat one meal a day, your body will retain everything you put in your mouth for that one meal).<br>  <br>  Some girls are just meant to be big. Now ask yourself these questions:<br>  1.Do you have any relatives that are a little on the bigger than average size(including parents, sibling, aunts, uncles, cousin)?<br>  <br>  2.Do you want to lose weight for yourself or because your getting made fun of or picked on?<br>  <br>  <br>  If it is genetics then honey you might not be able to lose the weight, no matter what. And if your not doing it for yourself but others than don't.<br>  <br>  I'm 21yrs old and been living with being a little "hippy" as they say. Im only 5'4 and I weigh 190lbs. Its taken sometime(and I never allowed myself to cause harm such as starvation or self-induced vomiting to my body). Big is beautiful and told let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  If you need someone to talk to and help you through Im willing to be there for you. Hope this is helpful to you.|`|S1jddreQaa	Yeah, don't do that, You stop eating you'll just gain all the weight back when you start eating again. It doesn't work. I know, I've tried. It was a nightmare. <br>  <br>  Now I am losing weight the healthy way. Its not easy at all. Don't expect it to be easy. You have to change your diet, eat better. Its actually a good idea to eat 5-6 small meal through out the day, then 3 big ones. I started out running on the treadmill for 30mins every day, but you can start will just 3-4 days a week if you want. Just increase the speed or the time your on the treadmill it when you feel it getting easier. And it takes a while, the hardest part is starting. The first month you feel the difference, the second month you notice the difference, and the third month others might start noticing the difference. I've lost 65 lbs so far.|`|aZWxKhbhaa	Honey... That is pretty hard but first and foremost, learn to love yourself. Then, pick and choose what your eating.  Avoid fatty/ calorie filled foods and exercise every other day.  If you really want to lose weight that bad, then you've got to do this. Exercise every other day for 30 minutes for a start (go running, brisk walking, ellipticals). But i would just suggest cutting down on what your eating that better eating habits. Drink no soda bc it is absolutely sugar filled.  And when you do it, don't make yourself full.  Leave it so your stomach is 1/4ths empty this way your stomach will shrink and you won't be so hungry all the time.  And dont make yourself sick.  You'll start to look ugly and not healthy.|`|192Ys1alaa	I know this seems wrong, but not eating will cause you to gain weight not lose it.  <br>  <br>  Take each day one at a time and join an exercise routine or club.  Don't think about losing 10 lbs by next weekend because you will only lose 2, feel bad and gain 6 more.  Learn what your food triggers are and avoid them.  you can do it!  Think long term, like 1 year from now I want to lost 20 pounds.  That is doable.<br>  <br>  I gained 50 lbs in only 2 years after college.  I was able to drop 30 and keep it off for the last 15 years.  Weight loss is much easier for guys than girls.  There are bad days, bad months, but also good days and good months.  Good luck!|`|TC6Fmugcaa	do not starve yourself of do anything unhealthy to lose weight!<br>  to lose weight you must maintain a healthy diet, and get at least 20 minutes of exercise 3 times a week. to maintain a healthy diet you must get all 5 food groups in every meal daily. (the food groups are whole grains, vegetables, fruits, dairies, and meats) also do not eat processed foods. they contain saturated fats. saturated fats stay in your body and cause veins and arteries to clog up. if you take in fewer calories than you burn you lose weight. also you need to get the vitamins and minerals your body needs. vitamin c is very good for you. it will not hurt your body at all.<br>  <br>  i hope i help you|`|gX40pgLyaa	Hun i know how u feel. I used 2 feel that way 2 and 4 a lil wile i even did make myself sick but in school we watched a video on bad diets n u wouldn't believe wat could happen 2 u. It took me a wile but i stopped. Plz don't start. You will be doing yourself a HUGE favor. Just exercise and have a healthy balanced diet.|`|bYbSVvR4aa	no one is perfect...<br>  alot of ppl also dont like the way they are. <br>  but you dun need to torture yourself rite?
vsaaaSsAaa	Actually, don't over-clean it.  That will mess-up your body's own bacteria/yeast/discharge/pH balance.  Just clean like normal.  There are over-the-counter medications for yeast infections.  (Monistat).  <br>  If you go to the doctor, they can give you a 1-time pill, which is much more convenient than Monistat.  (Monistat is a cream or suppository that you have to shoot into your vagina for like 5-7 days)<br>  <br>  Eating yogurt doesn't do anything, because yogurt is made of bacteria--- you want yeast (plus, how does a food from the stomach make it's way all the way to the vagina?  That isn't possible).  Cranberry juice is for a Urinary Tract Infection, NOT a yeast infection.  <br>  <br>  Fishy smell is from Bacterial Vaginosis.  (the previous post is incorrect though, because it doesn't cause PID-- that's Chlaymdia and Gonorrhea).  This would be a VERY fishy smell though.  I think what you were describing is not this bad.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|r6mXVSLjaa	You should probably be alright just cleaning it and stuff.  I feel you shouldn't worry too much about a yeast infection, but if you ever feel that it's being abnormal down there, it's good to be cautious and do what you can to take care of it.  If it doesn't do anything, don't worry too much unless it gets worse.  That's when I'd check in with your doctor.|`|e0k3oyavaa	Make sure not to use such perfumed soap because it can irrate down there. I would see a doctor jussssst in case.|`|2xTT414eaa	mayybe. they say to drink cranberry juice too. I think you should see a doctor if it doesn't get better.|`|ziVtTtObaa	A slightly fishy smell is classic Bacterial Vaginosis. it can be related to sex or even freq douching which changes the pH  in the vagina. If it does not get treated with antibiotics it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or worse. If there was not a fishy smell and the discharge was thick and cottage cheese like it could be a yeast infection.|`|ib2BLbDTaa	Just go tot the doc they will give you a pill you take it once and your set it's gone.

They even had my benefits active in 2 hours and was able to use them the very same day. good luck and hope this helps.

Sometimes are body goes out of wack which will make your period go out of wack. It's nothing really to worry about.|`|13f1d6fd99f53f760ce7aa96135fa746aa	periods can be influenced by several different factors. hormonal changes due to stress will throw off a menstrual cycle. another factor is meeting new females/ hanging out with other ones more. what happens is, the two females will sometimes start syncronizing their periods, i believe this is due to pheromones being at different levels during/before/and after menstration. another thing that can change it is a change in diet or enviroment, or even a change of age, since this will relate back to hormonal changes.|`|LN9VyF5qaa	Changes in diet can affect your period.  Stress is also a factor.<br>  <br>  Also, for me... whenever I go back to school (and am around a lot of girls and guys my age all the time rather than my family) my period arrives at a different time.  At school, it works to match my roommates'.  Maybe you've been hanging out with someone a lot and you're just syncing up?|`|VRSUyeqbaa	you are stressing about it way too much. just relax and it will come. always carry a pad with you in case it does surprise you.|`|4faa4a802c62abc346118d4c8f12a883aa	when was the first time you got ur period? if you had ur first period only up to 2 years or so.. its very common to have an irregular period. nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  if you have had your period for multiple years then it could be due to lack of body fat.
EDCW5t9Vaa	relax that's just your hormones sorting them self out. you would be surprised how many girls hav and have had the same problems you do trust me i'm in my early twenties and my period has now started to regularize. what i can tell you for sure is that the exercise will definitely help you and your body is growing and needs its nutrients to do so properly so be very careful with those diets because poor nutrition can affect your period as well.|`|44taGMNaaa	It's really nothing to worry about the same thing is and was happening to me im the same age as you we just have an irregular periods

Asbestos warts can be caused through repeated fiber penetration of the skin, causing hard, unsightly wart-like nodules.<br>  <br>  If asbestos fibers become airborne in your home or work area, and you breathe these fibers consistently for prolonged span of days, months, or years, you stand a much greater chance of eventually suffering from one of the three deadly diseases. Merely being exposed once or twice to asbestos is not known to pose an immediate or long-term health threat.<br>  <br>  If asbestos is exposed, there's a chance the particles are becoming airborne.  Don't risk it!|`|nxNnJ9vuaa	Asbestos is not dangerous when it is pack in a solid form as it is in your roof. But if the asbestos is exposed and you can see it fraying this means the dangerous microscopic fibres may be in the actmosphere and if they are inhaled this can be incredibly dangerous. The illnesses caused by asbestos may not appear until 20+ years after exposure. There are specialist companies who deal with the removal of this material and I would recommend that you contact one if you are still concerned.|`|gHyu4Hqaaa	You should not disturb the asbestos at all.  When broken or disturbed fibres of this may go into the air.  If this is breathed in and inhaled it can cause very serious health problems in the future.  I dont know exactly how long it takes .. can take years but many people have died from breathing in aspestos.  <br>  My cold tank in my attic is made from aspestos but I have been told its ok to leave it there as it will not be  disturbed in any way and is lined.  <br>  Plumbers and builders need to take extra care and often need to get specialist companys in who take samples and  then arrange for removal of aspestos if needed.   Dont try and do it yourself.   I have had inpections done in my house for this purpose.  I am sure you can find any information you need  from you local council or local authority  rather than just get some one from an advert who might not do the job correctly.|`|k8uzVf7oaa	i am not complete agree with 1st answer..<br>  Asbestos is dangerous in any form ,but it is more dangerous when it is in dust form...many tiles solid form don't cause any cancer,but why to take risk??<br>  <br>  & i agree that what important is the duration of exposure to asbestos...<br>  So the time period matters..<br>  it is not like you are exposed to asbestos for a day & you will get mesothelioma...|`|Np0Y3vUCaa	Asbestos is extemely carginogenic. It's most closely linked to Mesothelioma, a cancer of the mesothelium in your lungs. You should call someone to have it repaired or removed. Not sure about costs, but whatever it is it's worth it. That stuffs nasty if you are exposed to it constantly.|`|gPvOcB6oaa	Provided it is not broken or cracked it is not a problem|`|Ublc3bAtaa	VERY. blue asbestos is one of the worst things on the planet...<br>  <br>  a specialist removal company should be contacted to remove it and it wont be cheap, but can you put a price on health?

1zgWUTXZaa	It's really startling how many physiological and psychological disorders are linked to stress, schizophrenia being a major one. My father is schizophrenic, as is my grandmother, and I really believe that a lot of why my father developed the disorder was because he grew up in a poor household with only his mother. When you spend your entire childhood and young adulthood with a majority of your time being around someone with the disorder, it adds a lot to the genetic predisposition because you're so accustomed to that being the way your parent is teaching you to act and think. As it relates to me, having two close relatives with the disorder, I have an increased genetic predisposition, but as my parents divorced when I was young and I have spent very little time with my father or grandmother, I have not developed any symptoms, although I have taken care to watch out for any warning signs or symptoms ever since I found out about my relatives. According to the psychodynamic viewpoint, having a cold or unnurturing parent or parents can also be a cause. There's also the theory of it being caused as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. In this case, people are diagnosed with it, and whether or not they really do have it initially, they may develop or intensify symptoms as a subconscious reaction to the diagnosis.|`|NzR25cQAaa	If the child is alone at most times or is feeling neglect, there is a distinct sign of early disruptive thought patterns.<br>  <br>  If he keeps to himself or thinks differently than you want him to...|`|GFvcoK2Uaa	my brother has schizophrenia. i don't know alot about it really. a large factor was probably the drugs. sorry i don't know alot.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	An unstable environment such as moving a lot drug abuse alcoholism child abuse domestic violence.

qnD5RfbPaa	I would suggest that you start drinking a lot of fluids right now - freshly prepared fruit juices, freshly prepared vegetables juices made from fresh raw fruits and fresh raw vegetables.  Drink a glass every half hour.  You also need to be drinking lots of water.  You may put about a quarter teaspoon of salt in eight ounces of water and drink at least a glass of that over a 4 hour period. <br>  <br>  Having three or four cups of hot ginger is also good. If you were in my country I would say two or three bottles of D&G Ginger bear.  Ripe banana is also recommended to stop diarrhea.  Pineapple should also help.  If after commenting the above, your condition continues beyond 12 hours, go to see a doctor.|`|cf958f585e81f35dda5c9e48e6f15eb2aa	Pain, pressure, diarrhea and gas all point to gastric upset. You may have eaten something that didn't agree with you, or have either a viral or bacterial thing going on. If it persists for more than a couple of days you may want to see a doctor to rule out anything serious. Until then just ride it out. Sounds to me like a mild case of gastritis which will resolve on it's own. Make sure you are drinking plenty of clear fluids to prevent dehydration.|`|X1TeqHcxaa	Try these sites.|`|BmnwsvfOaa	idk but u should see a doctor or drink pepto bismal alot

Theres probably a problem, but get ur terms right and see a professional.|`|i8Pl0Pejaa	no, you do not have schizophrenia.<br>  Schizophrenia is having multiple personalities, and is a pretty serious mental disease. <br>  As for the problem solving, you might have ADHD, or ADD.<br>  If it gets worse, you should probably go to the hospital just to make sure you're alright.
5yCdBRjiaa	OMG, i look my pecks i want them bigger though. OKAY you have to follow this routine like i tell you. so when you wake up do push-up (i do 50 at a time) go to the bathroom and brush your teeths. come back to your room and do another set of push ups (50 or the amount that you can). go take a shower, shave and do what you got to do. but your boxers on and do another set, as much as you can. that gives you a total of 3 sets of 50 reps before eating breakfast, which is good to kick you metabolism to work and shred some weight. when you come back from work/school do another set do something else (weight at least 10 minutes) so that your muscles relax and do another set. i suggest that you use snicker when you do it so that you don't slide and get a good grip on the floor. i like to do them with a sleeveless shirt/shirtless sometimes, it is more comfortable. DO at least 8 sets throughout the day for SIX days, NOTE that i said SIX. that 7th day you won't do any push-up, this will allow your muscles to repair themselves and grow. i promise you that your pecks and arms are going to get tone in 1-2 weeks. it will also help your abdomen get firmer, not ripped BUT firm. in 3 weeks you should have a define chest and nice arms. <br>  <br>  Remember to eat rice or pasta everyday to get energy from it, eat as many times as you are HUNGRY, the food will make you get some fat and energy that you will be using to build your pecks.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK man, i am doing this every day. when you are able to do 40 push ups in a row, try knuckle push-ups. some days do more that others to make sure you do not hit a PLATO!|`|nG0HLvGjaa	do some push ups lift waits and run

6uQh4VSpaa	Those definitely sound like withdrawal symptoms.  Paxil is known for having somewhat more severe withdrawal symptoms than other antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds.  It's not a disease, and it will go away!<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid withdrawal effects are to very gradually stop the medicine.  For example, whatever your current dose is, take 50% of that for a month, then take 25% of it for a month.  That way your body doesn't have to adjust to sudden changes.  <br>  <br>  Either way, it's probably best to talk to your doctor about it.

I 've been doing the same thing and  feeling the same thing  lately and I can feel the  weight slowly catching up to me. I went to the gym yesterday and on my way back popped into the chinese takeaway.  I've just eaten half an angel cake  so you're not the only one .<br>  <br>  I think you need to find another outlet. I personally find that I eat the most when I'm, at home and bored, but  when I'm with my partner or out and about, I tend not to get hungry.

I have taken all the SSRIs and the SNRIs, plus Remeron and Wellbutrin, and various combinations.  <br>  <br>  If you're not going to a psychiatrist, I strongly urge you to do so.  Psychiatrists work with these drugs full time and they know them better than other physicians.  You're more likely to have success with a psychiatrist.<br>  <br>  If you have not taken a SSRI/SNRI in combination with Remeron or Wellbutrin, that should be tried.<br>  <br>  While you're trying different drugs, I suggest that you complete the Beck Depression Inventory once a week.  That will tell you if there is any change.  Where it says "recently," or something like that, I take that to mean "in the last week."  Scoring is at the bottom of the second page.<br>  <a href="http://www.maryreigel.com/media/beckdepression.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.maryreigel.com/media/beckdepr...</a><br>  <br>  I have an "industrial" case of depression and have stayed away from the "alternative" treatments, like St. John's Wort and Sam-E.<br>  <br>  Even if the SSRI/SNRI does not cure your chronic depression, it does make an episode of major depression less likely.  For that reason, I continue taking them.  Currently, I'm on fluoxetine (Prozac) and bupropion (Wellbutrin).  I can get a month's supply of fuoxetine at Wal-Mart for $8.00.  Bupropion is a generic, but it is $125 per month.<br>  <br>  I'm a scientist, so I have a pretty good understanding of what goes into developing a drug versus what goes into developing a drug alternative.  I really don't think it is a good idea to take the alternatives.  They are not tested very well.  The fact that you're looking for anecdotal information is an indication that this alternative is insufficiently known.<br>  <br>  I get hit pretty hard by the sexual side effects of the SSRIs, but I put up with that because they are tested and proven to be safe and effective, and they are protective against major depression.

1dL6fU0Haa	I get approached all the time from people looking to slim, trim, and shape their butt!    Whether they have lost it over the years or feel as though they landed on the wrong side of the gene pool, tightening and toning the glute muscles can be achieved by including these most important exercises into your workout routine:<br>  <br>  1.  Squats<br>  Squats are a no-brainer and as they are clearly one of the best exercises for the legs, hips, butt, and thighs.  This involves the simple motion of standing up and sitting down over and over again.  With each movement, all of the muscles of your but are fully engaged and making sure you get a nice soft landing with each descent.  The deeper you go, the higher the intensity and the more you will feel the muscles tighten up!<br>  <br>  2.  Lunges<br>  <br>  Lunges are another great addition to any butt-wrenching workout as they help to isolate each individual leg.  Start by taking a massive step forward with one foot and then stop there.  Slowly bend both knees thereby lowering your back leg towards the floor and then right before your back knee touches, push yourself back up to the top and then repeat.  I would recommend you did 10 repetitions per leg 3 times each switching in between.  <br>  The only draw back to this one is that it can have an effect on the knees if this is a weak area for you so if you experience any pain while performing this one I suggest you skip it.<br>  <br>  3.  Glute’s<br>  One of my all-time favourites…Glute extensions are very effective at isolating the muscles in the butt region and helping to shape and form the area quite nicely.  Simply get down on all fours, take one leg and kick it back behind you over and over breathing out as you kick back.  Make sure to keep your head down and think about pushing something away from you with the heel of your foot!  For this one, I would recommend a repetition range of about 20 done consecutively for 3 sets.<br>  <br>  4.  Hip extensions<br>  This one will surely get your butt working…Start by lying down on your back with your knees bent.  With your hands down on either side of you, lift the butt as high as you can towards the ceiling!!!!  Hold it there for 2-3 seconds and then lower it back down to the starting position.  The higher you go the more you will feel it and make sure to squeeze the butt real tight at the top and then slowly drop it back down to the floor.  Repeat this 20 times squeezing it hard for 2-3 seconds at the top each rep and you will be one step closer to fitting into those nice form fitting jeans ;-)<br>  <br>  5.  Stiff-legged deadlifts<br>  This one is a little more difficult and more on the advanced side but once you can master it, the results will be worth it!  To start, stand up straight feet together.  Slowly bend over making sure to keep your knees absolutely straight!  Go as low as you can while keeping the back straight and arched, once you feel a pull behind the knees, make your way back to the starting position and then repeat.  To add resistance, hold a small weight in each hand and let your arms hang down as your bending forward.  Remember, it is crucial that you keep the back straight to feel this in the right spot.  If you feel it in the lower back, you’ve gone too far.  Do about 15 repetitions for 3 sets stretching the hamstrings between each set in order to prevent and cure a saggy butt!<br>  <br>  Don’t forget that on top of all this, to really add the finishing touches to a nicely shaped butt, I would strongly recommend you make an effort to also include about 2-3 hours of cardiovascular activity each week.  Whether on the bike, treadmill, elliptical or simply walking outdoors or playing your favorite sport, if you can work that into your program you will decrease the amount of fat in the surrounding butt area so as to really see your results pay off!<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------<br>  Marc Lavender<br>  Personal Trainer - <a href="http://www.one80.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.one80.com</a>|`|bObtJCAVaa	Lunges.. squats..|`|6WCftPIyaa	Targetted weight loss is quite hard, many would declare impossible, nevertheless the one thing which definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

As far as endurance goes, it is very difficult to obtain. Once you reach a point where you consider yourself relatively fit it's just a slow process from there. if  you get down to a 6 minute mile pace for 10 miles it might take you a year to shave a minute or two off of that. If you are just starting working out you will see results rather quickly. The common mistake people who are beginning make is working out every other day. you are better off working out say 4 days in a row and then taking a break.
Dmb5OQT1aa	I had a similar scare about 2 years ago.  It started out as a very small unnoticeable bump but over the course of a week or two kept growing and swelling more.

Then it still took about a month before it healed completely.

My boyfriend gets one when I rub his leg, so yeah I'd say it's pretty common. They'll be used to it I'm sure, so they won't pay you out or anything. Just remain calm and try your best to not get aroused I suppose.

You can get them on your ears too.|`|f8epBxFOaa	its probably a pimple|`|PVrEBujSaa	Pimple?|`|vVDdq7F3aa	It is possibly a blackhead or even a whitehead but they are very painful and will make your whole ear hurt .. the only way to get rid of this is to extract it using an extraction tool you can buy this at Sally's ...|`|rzFxCSJyaa	I would say a pimple or possibly an infection due to a scratch or something like that.  Does not sound like it has to do much with the piercings|`|p2605ETpaa	Yeah a blackhead theyre bitches get a friend or family to pop it it will hurt like mad but feel great after :)

I know it's expensive but i'm pretty sure you could find a good deal. Straighten your hair once a week and I'm sure it will be curled. Use a comb too.
AA10069553	I do. I like the smell, the taste, the stupid little rings and tricks you can do with the smoke; it makes food taste better, it makes things more fun, it makes overeating more enjoyable. I come up with amazing things while high, everyone who smokes weed gets along (I've never met a fellow stoner that I didn't like) and feelings are amplified and made enjoyable. Walking feels better, breathing feels great, swimming is awesome, music sounds better, time slows down. But I'm not addicted or anteing. I've got 6 or so months without thinking about it a lot just because I didn't see my friend during that time. In short it makes my life more fun and more enjoyable.|`|6gapssLfaa	I used to smoke all the time and I absolutely loved it! <br>  <br>  I've been clean for about 2.5 months now cuz ivebeen trying to get a job but cuz of this crappy econy we are facing right now that seems about impossible.

I moved to a different state to live with my other parent, therefore I quit. <br>  <br>  I used it because it made me feel relaxed and stopped me from worrying all the time (I have issues with anxiety). <br>  <br>  Will I stop?

iGZWeWwBaa	? Yes, you will|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	You have fallen for a scam.  What happens in 3 days is that you clean out your colon.  You have several lbs of...soon to be crap...in you intestines at any time.  When you drink nothing but liquid for a couple days, you go to the bathroom and lose the weight that was food in your intestines.<br>  <br>  That's not losing weight as you gain it the next time you eat.<br>  <br>  You would do far better to not drink anything with sugar but only drink water, to stop eating junk food (no chips, no cakes, no cream filling), and to eat all the veggies and fruits you want.  Then to do something active every day.  Jump rope for 5 minutes,  Ride your bike around the neighborhood.

CJeufMTWaa	1.) Yes, I had light sedation, not general anesthesia.  I guess that's what you're calling 'Twilight'.  But it knocks you out the whole time, so you won't remember or feel a thing and it's safer than general anesthesia.<br>  <br>  2.) No, I didn't have any complications afterwards.  I also had no pain.<br>  <br>  3.) Orgasm was the same afterwards, although very infrequently I got an uncomfortable tightening feeling inside when I was aroused.  It never happened beforehand so I assume it was because of the surgery.  My guess was scar tissue?  I experienced that very infrequently for about a year or more, but I don't experience that feeling anymore.<br>  <br>  4.) I can't remember how long I was told to wait to have sex.  I don't think it was as long as a month, but I can't remember.  Anyways, I had no pain once I resumed sex.<br>  <br>  On a side note, if you have more than one LEEP procedure or if you have a very extensive LEEP procedure, then when you get pregnant you should tell your doctor so that they can monitor you in your second trimester to make sure you don't develop an incompetent cervix.  My doctors said that this rarely happens, but it's possible.  So just keep it in mind for the future.
gTmDlL07aa	I had this same problem. I had head-aches for 3 days straight, and began to have problems standing. I was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation, in one of the slightest forms.<br>   This might not be the problem however (and most likely isn't, as Chiari is a problem with the spinal cord). What I like to do, is I take a Tylenol, or advil, or some other form of a pain killer, and lie down for a while. Don't read, watch T.V. or anything that would strain your eyes, just lay down with your eyes closed and try to fall asleep. If the head-ache lasts for along time, even after sleeping, I would go see your doctor. Hope this helps, and everything goes well!
FlmQ2MYNaa	10 days is way to long to go without a bowel movement.  The toxins in the feces are building in her body, and she could become septic (bacteria gets into the bloodstream) and die.  <br>  <br>  One of the biggest problems with the elderly is dehydration, and it's the first step to constipation.  Then many don't eat well, which again can lead to constipation.  It's probably a deadly mixture of not drinking enough, not eating well, and lack of exercise that has put her in this position.  <br>  <br>  She needs a mineral enema.  You can get this at any drugstore.  It will clear her digestive tract.  I imagine that at this point the feces is so impacted (that means the build up of feces on top of one another) that the feces will need to be pulled out of her manually - this is something that a RN or doctor can do.<br>  <br>  Please take her to the ER.  I know it sucks to wait, but she desperately needs medical attention.  I'll take her if you don't want to!  <br>  <br>  I have to add this too - people over 65 have the same rights children under 18 do - please don't take offense to this, but her caregiver could go to jail for not getting her the medical attention she needs.  <br>  <br>  I would also say get a doctor that has a brain.  It's incredibly stupid of him to not admit her, unless he/she knows something we don't.  <br>  <br>  I'll keep her in my prayers.  Good luck, and PLEASE take her to an ER if you can't administer the enema.  And in no way did I mean to offend you.<br>  <br>  I'm such a freak I have to keep reading my posts - Definitely give her water.  The doctor said she wasn't impacted?  I have no idea how she isn't.  Even still, in my opinion you need a second opinion.  There's just something not right going on here. God Bless!|`|8j7FCEOraa	10 days is long enough for her toxic bowels to start poisoning her.<br>  Suck it up and wait at an er for 12 hours.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Take her to a colon/rectal surgeon.  They can solve this.  My son had a similar problem and he solved it for him.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Old people have all kinds of problems with their bowels, including constipation and also diarrhea...both happen very easily with old people.  The main reason for this is that their muscles around that region especially, are extremely weak.  Basically they have trouble pushing it out or holding it in, as disgusting as that might sound...sorry.  Has she been eating alright?  How about drinking water?  What some people don't realize is that if you load up on fiber but don't drink enough water, you actually bind things up even more.  You need lots of water to flush it through.  I would have her drinking water like crazy for today, then if nothing happens tomorrow, take her to the doctor.  Why ER?  A good doctor can help her in office I am sure.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	sometimes they have to have it dug out. sounds abit ugly but that is what happens to older people. its stuck in there and it has to come out and therefore you have to tak her to the doctor and have it taken out they do it in the office. its discusting but its called impacted.

GcWRPLd6aa	you're right it could just be some post-nasal drainage. if it's clear or slightly off white that's okay. If it's rusty, a bright green or any other color it might be something to worry about (infection) (if you do get the occasional bloody nose, that may cause it to be discolored) But since you don't have any other symptoms I would say you are okay. Just that time of the season<br>  <br>  Sleeping by a humidifier might help, or drinking plenty of fluids|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Do you still have your tonsils?   Sometimes as you get older, they get cryptic and dead cells collect and form hard almost glass like nodules sometimes, but mostly bad tasting mucous that you suddenly notice in your throat.  Try gargling with hydrogen peroxide if that is the case.
PjyP8yEiaa	I have seen patients do it all the time. Although everyone is different, you can judge how sensitive your teeth are. Also, depends on what type of bleaching you will be doing. You have take home, zoom, deep bleach all with varying levels of intensity and results. Definitely consult with your general dentist to see what they think|`|dwLqreuvaa	You could i guess but i would double check with your orthodontist.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't because, your teeth will be a bit sensative because they have jsut got chunks of metal removed from them which have been on for 3 years. So it willl feel a little wierd.<br>  <br>  I don't see any other reason than sensativity but i would just go over it with my orthodontist :) good luck

Anywhere from .25 to 1 gram should probably do the trick for one person.|`|1e7ef5bc5381f36fcc4da6e6df2b284faa	Weed is illegal and can kill brain cells.<br>  <br>  But if you must... OVER 9000!|`|qVZklYNPaa	You would probably "get high" with the first hit. It has nothing to do with gramage. It is said that some people do not "get high" the first time they smoke pot. It is unwise to smoke pot, as it is illegal, harmful to your lungs, and eventually makes you apathetic. Find something positive to make you high, such as exercise, which stimulates the bodies production of endorphins-the body's natural high!|`|duIQeYWOaa	come on if you have to ask... how old r u? Anyway just an herb: most people are high after smoking one bowl, but three is better!

If a large meal is consumed late you have no way to burn off the calories, you consume them and go to bed, not great for weight loss.A large healthy breakfast gives you energy to get moving and thinking clearly and you are able to burn quite a bit of it by mid- morning if you are active a large dinner on the other hand, no.|`|q2zGa5xkaa	Short answer is no, but think about it basically to maintain  your weight the calories eaten need to equal the calories burned. So if your needing to eat about 2000 calories a day to maintain your weight then if you eat 2000 calories during the day and then an extra 300 at 9pm you will be gaining an extra 300 calories or about one tenth of a pound a night. But if you only eat 1700 during the day and 300 at night then you will just maintain your weight.<br>  <br>  Simple.|`|A7SjBofFaa	ya its never good to go to bed on a full stomach because during the day your body will burn off the calories  but when you sleep it will just sit in your stomach and the calories won't burn off and the fats will store into your body so yes you will gain weight|`|Ky0e3wOhaa	yes you are not supposed to eat because when you eat at 7:00 then you have time to walk around and be active but if you eat at 9:00 chances are you are going to sleep at 9:30 or 10:00 and the calories cant be burned in time.
Q4ggnG0waa	My tumor had been growing for years, till one day the end of august this past year, I had a seizure at work. They got all my tumor. I underwent the treatments and am now on mega dose of temodar for at least a 6 month course. I've not had seizures since.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Yes. A brain tumor does not guarantee seizures. It depends on the size and location of the tumor.|`|yjDAg8v7aa	Yes. I have a brain tumor and evidently it had been there for years and I'd never had a seizure until Nov of last year when it started expanding. My doctors have told me that people have small tumors all the time and never know it because it doesn't effect them at all. I still have part of my tumor and am undergoing radiation and chemo treatments post surgery for it. I'm on seizure medication for the next year and then I'll be off of it, but I have only had the 1 grand mal seizure and 3 supressed seizures due to incorrect medication dosages.|`|RsVbDbgKaa	I had a brain tumor and did not have seizures. However, after the surgery to remove the tumor (immediately after), I was told I had one. I was told that it was common after brain surgery. I have not had any since.|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	yes, most definitly.|`|AA12212523	Yes.
be99dc3c82ca8ae28e21b34b45117e77aa	i think you have your concepts down.....such as using skim milk, eating veggies and fruits, and eating whole wheat instead of white carbs.<br>  <br>  however, especially if you have a lot of activity, you are not eating enough!! instead of eating 3 meals, try eating 6. i know people say that all the time, but it honestly works.  <br>  <br>  try adding some more protein, maybe some chicken or turkey? <br>  <br>  put your stats into this calculator (<a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/calc-bmi-plus)" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/diet/calc-bmi-plus)</a> and click on "your calories", it will tell you how many calories you should be getting a day based on your height/weight and activity level, it also tells you your BMI, waist to height ratio, etc. A pretty cool tool to use!<br>  <br>   Best of luck!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	This is not enough to eat. <br>  <br>  You need to figure out how many calories you should be eating per day, you are WAY beneath it. <br>  <br>  go to www.mypyramid.gov and get an intake goal.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	you will not gain in strength or muscle<br>  <br>  you should eat your protein before you exercise<br>  <br>  breakfast should be your biggest meal<br>  <br>  and not make dinner your biggest meal<br>  <br>  breakfast like a king<br>  <br>  lunch like a lord<br>  <br>  and supper like a Pauper|`|XZqSO94saa	You've eatten only under 900 calorie's.<br>  You should be consuming 1500- 1700 calories a day for weightloss. <br>  If you're trying to maintain you should be consuming 1800- 2200 calories.<br>  I definatly reccomend you have a high dense dinner with dairy and protein (which is lacking in you're diet) Plus you're burning off ton's of calories from you're 2 hour practise.<br>  Also have a high-dense snack after supper.<br>  <br>  Hope i'v helped, and goodluck!<br>  Pasta might be a good choice with a cup of milk, pasta sause and bread.|`|SB4N01OOaa	Your breakfast sounds good. You can eat more for lunch and dinner, especially if you're an athlete. You have to keep your energy up! Don't let yourself go hungry-that's not healthy.<br>  <br>  In general your food choices sound healthy but I would recommend adding some protein-meat, soy, peanuts...|`|IUxM3brbaa	not sure what lax is, but I think you need to be eating more if you are working out for 2 hrs. Especially for lunch. Answer: eat a little more, it sounds unhealthy.|`|YcN07uFvaa	its not enough food or protein|`|BTE56Vn3aa	It is really a good thing to eat a lot of food. you work out as well, so that is really a great thing also. it will keep you in shape, as long as you keep working out. if you stop, you will just start gaining weight. you're doing a good thing.|`|f7c5471c72f7f084411ee3f3f3e4b818aa	this much? I don't think you're eating enough
ghD5kN82aa	All I can tell you is this; people who get leg cramps can prevent them by regularly (say, twice a week) eating a ripe banana. The potassium in it somehow prevents such cramps from occuring. I could not live without them.You might try that. After all, what have you got to lose?|`|EjkQgPvWaa	When I was young my legs always hurt me as well and I was always told GROWING PAINS - well my legs still cramp and hurt and nothing stops them - Of course I have muscle relaxers and pain pills. One of the things my doctor has told me to do when my legs start cramping and hurting is to drink salt water... and it does help the spasm stop... you can also get some Bio-freeze and rub on you legs it is wonderful... It would not hurt anything to go the doctor and get them to check for arthritis. I am 44 and the pain in my legs started when I was 6 years old - got worse at about 13-16 then again about 30. good luck - Take some Naproxen - no tylonel
gViGPF0Faa	I've had ance since I was 12, and now I'm 18, and I've just now found out how to keep it good. (or maybe its just going away). But I only break out before my period. Well...what i do is wash my face everyday and every other day I use a mild exfoliant. That is important because it takes away the dead skin that ends up clogging your pores. After, you can buy a cream at a pharmacy, or you can use witch hazel. The witch hazel works wonders, I don't know why. If nothing ends up working, you shoud try the dermatologist even though prescriptions didnt work for me. Good Luck.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	depends if you mean over the counter or prescription<br>  <br>  topical retinoids are first-line therapy for mild-moderate acne (prescription)<br>  <br>  over the counter I recommend benzyl peroxide|`|uztigdN3aa	This is usually a hormonal problem,special for teenagers. Your hormones are not quite settled
KKh8rikGaa	Could be RA, sounds like you might also be a little depressed <br>  , a good physical, blood work should shed some light, see your doc soon, God bless
8e5f9cb1082d891d0f3075f0e2e92d34aa	Yes! Rice is just fine. The primary thing to avoid is sugar. Candida (Yeast) feeds on sugar. I would also recommend taking supplements like: Grapefruit seed extract, and Oregano Oil. The "Now" brand Oregano Oil can destroy yeast. I have known many people who have used it, and had nothing but good to say about it. As far as your diet, You want to avoid eating alot of bread, fruit juices, anything with a high sugar content, beer or wine, ect. Oats and rice are fine. There is a natural sweetener known as "Stevia" which is very good for you and a far better alternative to Sweet N Low and other poisonous sweeteners.|`|aPxmZq00aa	If you are truly following just a yeast free diet then you can have rice and also oatmeal. But if you are just to reduce starch (carbohydrates) in general then you would need to cut out all starches.|`|l5ccPTpVaa	Best start is a naturopath or dietician to guide and support you.<br>  Yeast is a substace/type of bacteria;fungus) that is added to things to make it swell, as in bread making, you let the uncooked mix sit and "prove" and it swells up.(or rises.) (A bit like what it is doing in your belly, sorry!)<br>  Yeast loves warm dark moist places to do its thing and be active. There are natural and very processed/chemical types. Yeast can then keep expanding itself, if conditions are right, like the internal organs!<br>  Rice in itself is okay, it depends how it is cooked and ingested as to if it holds yeast that is active. Some time other food ingested can enhance the enviroment for yeast to survive at an abnormal level, that causes distress, some foods can redduce that chance, like alter pH, Yogurts with active good bacteria versus bad bacteria.<br>   To reduce the starchiness of rice and potatoes ect, prior to cookind, wash rice thru running water, well. Let un cooked rice sit in cold water a least an hour, and rinse before cooking, rinse more frequently, as you see fit. If the water goes cloudy, thats the starch. At this time use COLD water, at the end of cooking Rinse under HOT water to reduced starch. <br>  This wont take all starch out , but some if it bugs you. <br>  With Potatoes do the same after you peal. Really  good reponse if left in cold water over night, you will see the coudy water!<br>  <br>  When drawing starch  from potatoes like this, a little sugar comes too. (not enought to measure in calories, so dont stress it!) Cooks who want nice crispy baked potatoes do this but don't give a last rinse pior to going in oven, as the little bit of starch and sugar caremillises, and make potatoes nice and crispy brown,outside, and lite and fluffy on the inside, YUMMO!<br>  Things like rice cracker/ biscuit/waifers, mostly dont use yeast, so are good snacks. When pruchasing a processed product, Yeast or "leavening agents" should be listed on packet, READ LABELS.<br>  Any food can react with yeast in the intestine to keep the growth going. This is why support with some one who knows their stuff is important. It is an awful condition to  have, it takes a long dedicated path to treat it properly like this and can return easily, one of the biggest causes is "the pill" and antibiotics, so I hope you have a good Doctor to help or reffer.<br>  <br>  Fair Well, and stick with your plan. You will get there! Sucess will be your and you can help others!

ukgDQsnKaa	I assume what you are asking is, "How do male to female transsexual develop breast?" <br>  <br>  They start to develop breast after about three to four months of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Please keep in mind everyone develops differently rate and in final size, thus some Transsexual opt to have breast enlargement surgery (implants) to increase the size of their breasts.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  <br>  FYI - "Tranny" is a slang term and it is very insulting to most Transsexuals.

I think our world could use some compassionate souls like you.|`|9bAKQAeUaa	It's good that you're trying to figure this out. I'm also in high school, and try to deal with the same issues. <br>  <br>  There are too many people in the world, but that doesn't mean that anyone is worth less and needs to be gotten rid of. Even though there's a lot of problems because there's so many people--it's not that we don't have enough resources. It's just that the resources don't go where they need to. There's a very small amount of people who have so much, while everyone else has to lack what they need--to provide excess for the top few. <br>  <br>  I want a world that provides for everyone (because we can) and doesn't use having children as a means of validation. Kids are amazing, but not everyone is really able to have kids and that's really okay. <br>  <br>  And people need acceptance...which is fine...and you found it someone constructive, which is great. Give people time, most of them will grow out of the high school behavior. <br>  <br>  It's really cool that you're not looking for answers in religion, necessarily. A lot of things can  be explained in reality, without a god or anything.|`|9t16Y3pyaa	i understand the religion thing, ive had a lot of problems being raised with out a religion. i feel in america you're free to believe in christianity, and im not free to not have a religion. i think people need to realize that its too a far a stretch to believe in creation when you were raised on darwinism. whatever though, im down with the bible thumpers continuing to live in a state of ignorance. [really im not intolerant, im  just jealous that i cant find the answers to life like they have] <br>  <br>  but the one minded people thing they are the ones emphasizing their own insecurities.[and yes i am insecure about my lack of religion, so i complain about the evangelicals] they aren't comfortable with themselves enough to except anything different. and as a kid who should be in high school,[im in college 2 year early] i can tell you that high school kids try so so hard to be different and original and they end up being a victim of conformity anyhow. they become one with the 8 million other kids trying to rebel. <br>  <br>  so yea, youre not alone in what youre thinking now. best of luck to you coming to terms with the world you live in. =]|`|cXXJVz64aa	It's normal to become bored or confused with life.

Hop scotch, watching Tv and doing sit ups, dancing, dancing, dancing? haha<br>  <br>  and umm:<br>  <br>  --- toning up ----<br>  <br>  It is possible. i think. <br>  <br>  if you REALLY try at it. just dont let any extra pounds get in the way.. <br>  <br>  just try light weights maybe..<br>  <br>  -- losing weight ---<br>  in the morning if you can wake up pretty early, thats when you have the most energy! drink a bottle of water plug in your ipod or whatever and listen to music as you run! -- thats my first step.<br>  <br>  Then you go home, eat a really healthy breakfast like fruit salad or something thats nutritonal. <br>  <br>  After that you pretty much clean the house or whatever maybe take a walk while its cool, walk your pet dog, if you have one, i like to spend the morning doing that while its not so hot outside!<br>  <br>  After that you wait a few hours being active as can be, then you relax a little and do some sit ups and lift weights to your own schedule... and your own statistics like weight height goals.. or whatever.. thats what i usually do! And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free. It makes you not snack because if you chew it, you dont want to snack because then you will have to spit out your gum! works for me.. <br>  <br>  thats my trick tip - now read the losing weight 411<br>  <br>  EXTRA: breathing for an hour burns 60 calories, so thats a little lift off your chest haha<br>  and sleeping is the same rate :)<br>  <br>  excersise at least 60 minutes a day if you can :)<br>  -------<br>  hey, you know what? The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things. Bread is a bad, so try to stick to thin, HIGH in fiber, slices :) <br>  <br>  you can google all the stuff and before you know it you will feel so good about it all and IM actually excited to start working out and all that, just because I know what it will do for me!<br>  <br>  I hope i helped :D|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	a lot of sit ups|`|c15d5a2b04a27a28c2483bb143ef991caa	"Tone" is a word that is only correctly used when hospital doctors talk about muscle problems associated with their patients lying in bed all day every day. It's a clinical word, not much else. For us, it's a dumb word that the fad diet industry picked up and throw around for financial gain (and no, they don't care about your actual health, as far as I can tell).<br>  <br>  For what you can do, first, I cannot stress this enough, but there is no way to work on specific parts of your body. It's counterintuitive, I know, but backed up by many studies over the past few decades. So that idea is out the window and anyone who suggests otherwise and tells you to waste your time doing endless situps is not necessarily stupid, but definitely a little misinformed.<br>  <br>  I think the best thing you can do is to alternate between weight training and cardio. Before you panic, don't worry. You're not going to get huge lifting weights; only male levels of testosterone will allow for that, and even so, I lift all the time and I'm not a whole lot bigger than your average dude. When you lift, don't just do specific body parts; instead, cover the whole body using exercises that include several parts at once, such as squats, benchpress, lunges, and rows. These might be intimidating at first, but maybe you can take a class at the gym or, if you have the money, hire a personal trainer for two or three sessions; that's how I learned.<br>  <br>  For cardio, just get on a bike or strap on those runners and just get out there. Very few instructions required Start gently, and stop when you feel tired. Don't increase intensity by more than 10% or so per week, or your risk of injury will go up. Stay hydrated throughout, and if you sweat lot, eat your bananas and a bit of salt to keep your sodium and potassium levels normal.<br>  <br>  It would be great if are able to do at least one of the two each day for 30-60 minutes. When you say "tone" I think you're referring to nice tight-looking muscles and that comes by itself. As your muscles get stronger they often ride a bit more tightly under the skin, and the steady cardio will bleed off stored fat from all over your body. The weightroom also helps in that stronger muscles burn more calories all day, even when you're sitting or sleeping.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
upoH8NP4aa	It really depends on your weight. i mean, if you gain ten pounds, maybe a pound will go to your boobs, if you lose ten pounds, then a pound will come of them.

93Sd2s8Iaa	Maybe more around 60-70, and that's not including the crazy plateaus you might come across. I had initially wanted to lose 60 pounds in 6 months, but ended up at 35 in 8. It really varies. Just stick to your diet plan and be happy with your results, even if they aren't what you initially intended.|`|7qr2GprBaa	That's a pretty tall order...your talking about 2 pounds a week. Most people can keep that up for a few weeks, but if you continually starve yourself, eventually you're going to feel sorry for yourself and have a binge. Then you'll feel horrible about yourself because "you're a failure". <br>  <br>  I put that in quotes because that's what happens to a lot of people who set unrealistic goals for themselves. They plan to do the impossible, and when they can't do it, they think they've "failed".<br>  <br>  Most diet experts say that healthy weight loss is about 1-2 pounds a week. So, realistically, you could lose 40-60 pounds in 10 months, and that's a LOT of weight. Someone once told me that when you lose 5 pounds, go to the grocery store and buy 5 pounds of hamburger. THAT'S what 5 pounds looks like. Believe me, it doesn't seem like much, but when you look at it in a package like that, you'll see how much you actually took off!<br>  <br>  So my advice is to plan to lose 40 pounds. If you lose more than that, then great. If not, don't worry about it. Losing any amount of weight is a huge achievement, but you will most likely look amazing if you lose even 20 or 30. <br>  <br>  And don't let all the media BS make you think that you have to be 6 feet tall and weigh 110 pounds. That's NOT reality!|`|PxMNxytjaa	Good luck and all but please do not become another Mary-Kate|`|i6cC0yUZaa	The pattern for losing those extra pounds is not difficult - consume less and workout more often - the difficulties arise when we really try to put that into practice! There are lots of temptations in the real world aren't there?! The one thing that definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost twenty five pounds, it definitely does work!|`|fb8eDg4Naa	Stop eating.  Take up cocaine.  You'll make it.
FKw0rOOpaa	By dirt, do you mean darker skin in these areas? Does it also have a different texture to the rest of your skin?<br>  <br>  If so, (although you may not have diabetes), you may have polycystic ovarian syndrome, which has darkened skin in the neck and armpits as a common symptom.<br>  Google it, or go here --> <a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/girls/pcos.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health...</a><br>  <br>  After you've read that, and if it sounds familiar to you, tell your parents to take you to an endocrinologist or a gynecologist (yes, even if you are just 12) and tell him/her about this. The doctor should ask you lots of questions and if you match the profile, he might ask to test your blood for hormonal levels.<br>  Trust me, it's better to have this checked out and treated sooner than later.<br>  <br>  Hopefully PCOS is what you have and not diabetes.|`|bySxEYo0aa	Do you mean freckles??

Y1LTzXataa	It's not TSS, and there is nothing wrong with using tampons. It's not unhygienic to use tampons. In fact, it is more hygienic than pads, but I'm not even going to go into that. You're just having a reaction to the hormonal changes in your body at that time. This is not abnormal. If it really bothers you, you can go on the pill and that can help.<br>  <br>  (You come on here to get answers from people who know something about the topic and you get answers from people who have no idea, like mwah42 and TaintedLove)|`|aZWxKhbhaa	If you use tampons- Don't. They're not very hygienic.  The blood needs to be able to flow out of your body rather than staying inside your body with a tampon.<br>  Otherwise, this is kind of abnormal.

Hope you feel better soon! <br>  <br>  Just saw that it is swollen, try some heat on it to loosen it up some but if it lasts more than another week or so talk to your folks about a dr. visit.  4 me it lasted about a week or 10 days.|`|wHVx9HZVaa	It sounds like you have trapped a nerve.

ch8DC4z7aa	The height that you achieve depends on several factors: 1) The genes you inherit from your parents; 2) The age you enter puberty (when you start to develop sexually); 3) the age you have your first period (if you're a girl); and 3) your general health. If you have a chronic disease, for example, this will affect your height. Most young women achieve their full height within 12 to 18 months after their first period. (around 16 years old) Most young men tend to stop growing at the end of puberty when they begin to shave regularly. (around 18 years old).........<br>  <br>  <br>  Approximately 2 years after puberty your epiphyseal growth plates which are attached to your leg bones and arm bones fuse so these bones are not able to grow any more. This is why you don't continue to grow indefinitely! It is estimated that this happens at an earlier age in girls than boys, around age 16 and 18 respectively. This varies in individuals.<br>  Around the time of puberty however we do have a growth spurt controlled by all the hormones in our body. <br>  <br>  Only time will tell but for what it's worth 5"8 is not THAT bad. . You're only 19 , its not too late you could still grow  taller, it's not unheard of....|`|XF1y4wMmaa	You are tallish. You are past a usual age.

From then on it is unlikely however it is not impossible.|`|dShQLjuGaa	yep.  I was like 5ft 8in until 19.  At around 20 I am 5ft 9.25inch.  So  you can get taller.  I would say around age 22.

Is there a husband around - you might mention this to him and let him research this on his own or, you can go to WebMd and print out symptoms of this disorder and let him draw his own conclusions.  Sometimes, this can progress to a dangerous level when people don't perceive that they are getting the attention of medical personnel, then they up the ante and some start poisoning their children or suffocating them, etc.  Someone needs to intervene on behalf of the children.

You hit it right on the nose. My mother is a SEVERE hypochondriac (spelling). Everytime I say "I have a headache" she says "well Ive had a migraine for 22 years!" Things like that. When we were kids we were at the docs ALLLLLL THE TIME. I mean, I think hers stemmed from me having childhood cancer. After I went into remission (7 yrs old) i was great. No probs what so ever. Everytime I said I had a pain here or there she would take me to the doctors. My sister and brother too. She used to miss so much work because she "pinched a nerve, pulled her back out, fell down the steps and has a hairline fracture in her hip BLAH BLAH BLAH!" I try to avoid the docs as  much as possible even though Ive become ill because of her. I dont want to be the person she has turned into because everytime she eats a taco and has to potty a lot she convinces herself she has the flu. When her and I talk on the phone, and im NOT LYING, alllll we talk about is her back pain, her vomiting, her migraines, her gum disease, her inflammation in her spine, her bloody faucet nose, her spine disease, her ear infection, her narrow angle glaucoma, her brain tumor and yada yada yada" I love my mother but everytime i even TRY to complain about something she has it and its ten times worse. The best thing for you to do is either call her out on it, or ignore her. People like her never change, I dont think anyways. Not till her kids get sick of it and confront her.|`|gzyj2Zrsaa	It is called Muchausens Syndrom by Proxy, and if what you're telling me is accurate then you could very well have a legitimate fear.<br>  <br>  Do the doctors know about all the other doctors (that you are aware of)? Obviously you cannot access their records but you should definitely talk to a family member of this woman if you can reach them, and if all else fails you should anonymously contact child protective services.<br>  <br>  It may not seem like much now but this attention seeking behavior, if that is what this is, only has a tendency to get worse and worse over time. This is something that needs to be looked into immediately before any children get hurt.<br>  <br>  If you have a chance to do so, talk to the older girl. She is going to be your best source of information.

I always use to cry when I would go shopping for clothes and those cute tops couldnt fit me and those backaches. My doctor told me i should wait until I was 18-20 to get it done because at that age your breasts are fully developed. You should talk to your daughter and ask her if she could wait it out a little until she's 18. If not, then go see a surgeon and he will talk to you about it. good luck!|`|qZVlDHBTaa	I think it would be the right thing to do to let her get a breast reduction because it will be beneficial both to her physical and mental health in the long run. She won't suffer from severe back problems and need a cane or a walker when she is older and she won't be depressed or living at home when she is thirty because she has no self-confidence to get out of the house and find a job or a boyfriend.

AA10975447	Here is the treatment protocol according to CDC:<br>  <br>  Penicillin G, administered parenterally, is the preferred drug for treatment of all stages of syphilis. The preparation(s) used (i.e., benzathine, aqueous procaine, or aqueous crystalline), the dosage, and the length of treatment depend on the stage and clinical manifestations of the disease. However, neither combinations of benzathine penicillin and procaine penicillin nor oral penicillin preparations are considered appropriate for the treatment of syphilis. Reports have indicated that inappropriate use of combination benzathine-procaine penicillin (Bicillin C-R?) instead of the standard benzathine penicillin product widely used in the United States (Bicillin L-A?) has occurred. Practitioners, pharmacists, and purchasing agents should be aware of the similar names of these two products and avoid use of the inappropriate combination therapy agent for treating syphilis (99). <br>  <br>  The efficacy of penicillin for the treatment of syphilis was well established through clinical experience even before the value of randomized controlled clinical trials was recognized. Therefore, nearly all the recommendations for the treatment of syphilis are based on the opinions of persons knowledgeable about STDs and are reinforced by case series, clinical trials, and 50 years of clinical experience. <br>  <br>  Parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented efficacy for syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women with syphilis in any stage who report penicillin allergy should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Skin testing for penicillin allergy might be useful in pregnant women; such testing also is useful in other patients.

Q4VwhcbXaa	This is unlikely to be a muscle.  I once fell down some stairs and got a mammoth bruise on my rear, I ended up with a lump and it never went away.  The doc said it was from the bruise (a clump of burst blood vessels) and often it is just absorbed back into the body but mine was too big.  So my bathing beauty days are ended but otherwise it is not a big deal.  I would wait a bit to see if it goes but since its near the eye I would have it checked in a while if it is still there.
t2R3mEMoaa	It's very sad when the ones that do abuse this medicine make it so difficult for us to even ask, because of their drug abuse. I feel the same way as you and you shouldn't have to justify asking for something that helps you when you clearly don't abuse prescription drugs. Try not to feel so guilty and in fact get angry because we are the ones that are paying the price for others prescription drug addictions. Go ahead and ask, your doctor should be understanding enough to believe you. However I wouldn't tell him/her you have some left or they might tell you to come back when they are gone. I certainly understand your feeling the way you do.|`|AA10295001	I've always been told that honesty is the best policy.  I would however like to see you get some type of therapy to help you with your anxiety out in public.<br>  <br>  Just taking a pill want solve the anxiety in the long run.  Eventually, you'll have to deal with this situation.  If it's not therapy, try a support group for victims of violet crimes.  Check at your local mental health department.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	You know, I was on the same exact drug for the same exact thing/reasons as you.  I would just take the bottle with you to your doctor appointment.  If this is the same doctor that prescribed it do you in the first place, I don't think you'd have a problem, but if it's a different doctor, just tell him/her what you said here, and I honestly don't think that you'd have a problem getting it again.  I'm the same way as you, I don't want to take any kind of long term daily pill, when it's just once in a while and certain case scenarios where I needed to take a Xanax from time to time.  Same as you, when I was out in public, or for some reason I would get freaked out at home when I'd hear noises or something.  I hope you don't have any problems, I really don't think that you would.  Good luck!|`|xSGPRRSvaa	didn't read the whole thing but just kind of tell him all of that and he will agree that you need more and prescribe it to you.

I think age is a lot to do with it and I felt like this at your age.  It is helpful to talk to a doctor if you think you could.  Exercise and a healthy diet can both help you feel brighter mentally.  Try to do things that make you happy (i know that sounds dumb) but if you enjoy playing computer, do that, or read.  I think listening to uplifting music helps. Dont listen to things that will bring you down like depressing music, or watch a depressing movie.  Associate with happy people if you can. And finally the doc could give you some medication.  Dont be to scared of anti depressants, they can have a bad name but if you find the one that suits you it can be a great help.  never resort to self harming.  Speak to a doctor before you let things get that desperate.  You dont want to get into that as thats just a bigger problem to get out of

VRSUyeqbaa	This is a serious question, don't understand why people have to be so rude. Actually, a woman can only get pregnant when she ovulates (releases an egg). This happens once per month in the middle of her cycle. If you are trying to conceive, you would want to chart your cycles, and have sex on days that you are fertile or close to ovulating.<br>  It takes about 3 days for the egg to release and come down the fallopian tubes where it may or may not be fertilized by sperm. Any other questions, concerns, go to my profile and email me.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	it is different for every one ,my mom got pregnant 4 times in 1 year or so<br>  <br>  it took me two years to get pregnant..|`|4WWVsABqaa	depends on how fast the sperm can swin to one of your eggs.|`|M6IjWGP1aa	Very quickly.

3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Assuming you have no brothers or sisters, perhaps you need to enrol in a club where you can participate in an activity that you find enjoyable. Socialising for the sake of company is not for everybody. Don't be so hard on yourself. There are many ways in which you can find things to do and meeting people, without realising. One day you meet a person who is fascinating and a friendship can blossom from this. The important thing is that you have made contact with the outside world by asking for help and already you are on the journey to changing your ways.|`|AA10818761	well first of all, antisocial means you don't care about nor can you identify with other people's emotions, most "antisocial" people are criminals, often murderers, so that's not the correct term to use to describe yourself, there is nothing wrong with you, if you like being alone and enjoy your life that way then what's the problem? however, you did state that you have trust issues, so i'd talk to a counselor if i were you and try to solve that problem, so in conclusion, your prob isn't that you're "antisocial" it's because you have trust issues<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA12384954	Don't be so hard on yourself.  Everyone is different and has different social needs, so there is no hard and fast rules about what you should be doing.  What is important is that you are happy, and if you are happy with your own company most of the time, who are we to say otherwise?  If you are feeling sad and would like some more company, look at your interests, and then consider joining a club or meeting people with similar interests.  There are a lot of lonely people in the world, and a lot of us feel lonely at times too, but just remember it is not a crime.  Just start off by a quick hello, and how are you, and keep moving, like you are going somewhere to practice.  There is always time at a later stage if you like someone to chat a little more, and perhaps build a friendship.  Just be yourself and try to relax.  Also, volunteering is a good way to meet people without going out on the town, and there usually are some very nice people to meet in those environments.  Good luck!
776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	You're 16, you don't have lung cancer.  <br>  <br>  It takes weeks, sometimes months, for your bronchial tissues to completely heal after a bout of bronchitis.  Smoking makes it take even longer. <br>  <br>  If this shortness of breath happens again, you should talk to your doctor.  What you're describing sounds an awfully lot like an asthma attack.  Again, you're probably still recovering from the bronchitis, but if your symptoms persist for more than another couple of weeks, you'll need to get it checked out.   <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Bronchitis can last for several weeks and, if you are smoking still, it will slow down the healing in your lungs.  It does not sound like cancer, just bronchitis.|`|q2Y9SzpXaa	Lung cancer shows up much later in life, so you do not have it.<br>  <br>  Bronchitus can take several weeks to get over.

bQ4RAi07aa	Yes.  How quickly one recovers from whiplash depends largely upon the severity of the injury. How quickly the symptoms develop often correlate with the seriousness of the injury. It seems that you are following all the necessary medical treatment for whiplash.<br>  <br>  Mild whiplash injuries often heal completely within two to three weeks, moderate whiplash injuries within two to three months. Severe whiplash injury may take several months to heal. For some people, symptoms (such as mild neck pain and/or headaches) may linger for longer periods of time. If symptoms are still present after six months, the pain is considered to be chronic. Chronic symptoms may last for years. Whiplash injury may increase risk of degenerative changes in the discs and spinal joints. <br>  <br>  Some people report that new symptoms appear years after the initial whiplash injury, though it is difficult to determine whether or not symptoms that appear years later are related to the whiplash injury. <br>  <br>  I hope you improve mine went on to surgery and chronic neck pain, hopefully yours will improve with time.  Taking Lyrica is new to me I was never prescribed Lyrica for my neck pain just muscle relaxers and pain meds.  I know a friend of mine who takes Lyrida for fybromyalgia.

If so, don't remove it yourself because it will need to be biopsied.<br>  <br>  If it is your average run-of-the-mill mole though, I found a pair of sterilized toenail clippers do the job quite nicely. (Boil the clippers prior to use.) Just be sure to clean the wound (daily) and cover it with a bandage until it heals.<br>  <br>  I did this with a mole on my nostril that kept returning, and I think it looks better than the two times I had it removed 'professionally'.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	Hi! From my personal experience I advise not to use any product for home mole removal. It can cause very serious problem. There are a number of methods doctors use to remove moles, and they include: An excision with stitches: The mole is cut out to its full depth and then the wound is sutured An excision with cauterization: The mole is burned away using a cautery tool. Stitches are not required for this procedure as the wound is burn-sutured, and will heal naturally. A laser surgery procedure: The mole is eliminated using a laser. A shave biopsy may be used for moles that protrude above the skin surface. There are more serious reasons why a mole needs to be removed, for example if melanoma or skin cancer is suspected. Some melanomas begin in the form of a mole. The procedures for removing moles usually take less than an hour.  Don't risk using a home removal can cause serious infection and if the mole is going to be removed it needs to be removed at the root by a doctor.  You don't have to give me the best answer I'm just responding in order to safeguard your health.|`|ORiAs4claa	Home remedy that i used.... Cauliflowers, garlic, pineapple, castor oil, honey, fig stems and hot water with vinegar are considered effective in mole removal. Select only one from the mentioned items. <br>  Step 1Prepare cauliflower juice in a blender. Rub the juice on your moles daily until the skin peels off naturally. <br>  Step2 Grind a few pieces of garlic into a paste. Apply the paste on your moles and cover it with a bandage. Do this at night and remove the bandage next morning. <br>  Step3 Make fresh pineapple juice daily. Apply the juice to the moles until they weaken and disappear. <br>  Step4 Rub castor oil on the moles gently for few days until they gradually weaken and disappear. <br>  Step5 Apply honey on the moles daily. <br>  Step6 Wash the moles with hot water five to six times a day. Let your skin dry, then apply cider vinegar to your moles with cotton swabs. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse with cool water. <br>  Step7 Make juice from fig stems (if you can find any in your area) and apply it daily to the moles until they vanish. good luck....it works|`|Wiwu7PUNaa	unfortunately, i don't think there is a way.  i know that if you cut it off (ouch!) it will only grow back, because it's rooted pretty deeply.  i may be wrong, but i know from consulting a dermatologist that commonly moles can't be removed without minor surgery (because you have to go deeply to remove it all).|`|cf958f585e81f35dda5c9e48e6f15eb2aa	You really shouldn't try this. Moles are very deep rooted and in order to get them it's a deep cut. Some actually require stitches after removed.|`|5bde15709483c28deedecc65456b59a2aa	I have had moles removed by a doctor, and I have also removed some at home.  I was looking on the internet a few years ago and found a product called Bio T herbal that will remove moles and warts.  It really does work.  I have removed several this way.  And prefer it to going to the doctor.  It's black and looks like dirt.  You put it on your mole (I used a foot file to file the top layer of the mole off so it could get in faster) cover it with a latex free bandaid and leave it for 24 hours.  Each day you reapply more until you see a white ring around your mole.  Then you leave it and in a few days the roots will dry up and let go, then your mole will literally fall off.  The product kills the roots.  I have had a few of my moles grow back due to some roots still left.  But they were much smaller and you can always reapply the Bio T again.  If your not careful it can cause scarring.  Hope I've helped.  I know what its like to have big ugly moles.

Without sufficient calcium you will suffer insomnia, headaches and migraines, irritability and moodiness and unnecessary brain frizz and stress, nasty mood swings, achy bones, digestive upsets such as bloating and cramping and constipation ......... calcium is essential for healthy bones, teeth and heart health and works in tandem with magnesium (known as the antistress mineral)...... lack of magnesium will give you migraines and headaches, nervous and twitching and muscular issues and will also cause lower back aches and bad digestion ....... increasing your daily intake of foods rich in both such as leafy and green vegies, brocolli, kale, spinach, buk choy, celery, fresh fish such as tuna and salmon and organic nuts and seeds such as almonds, brazil nuts and sunflower seeds will dramatically reduce your irritability and moodiness and stress levels and make you feel fine.<br>  <br>  Eat more green vegies mate, another thing they'll do is encourage the production of hydrochloric acid in your tummy and help resolve any issues you may have with constipation and bloating.<br>  <br>  A little extra effort sure but anything worth having is worth the extra effort ..... i reckon calmness and peace of mind is worth a few bowls of green vegies a day.<br>  <br>  (((huggs)))<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?|`|yE2vM76naa	bendryl over the counter - taken regularly it wont make you as drowsy.<br>  I like Kava as a herbal product though...|`|PpWosZsIaa	Fresh Air|`|8e5f9cb1082d891d0f3075f0e2e92d34aa	Well, evening primrose oil works very well with that. Many people think that evening primrose oil is only for women! Well, women take it because it helps them when they are going through their menstral cycle. It helps to calm them down. Just like it can help calm anybody down. Its great to take when your under alot of stress, and can help you sleep better. There is also aromatherapy. Things like Rosewood oil, Lavender Oil, ect.

Eating more veggies is the long term fix, but if you need something quicker: Min-Chex from Standard Process is a whole food supplement that can be very effective in calming you down without the drowsy.  The suggested dosage is 3 capsules per day, 3 times a day, but depending on your situation you may need up to 9 per day.<br>  <br>  You may have congestion in the liver/gallbladder that can also be contributing to the problem.  Fresh beet leaves in your salad and eating the beet root (however way you like) can really improve the flow of bile through your liver and gallbladder.  Bile is not only important in the digestion of fats, it is a means by which the body detoxifies itself.  Toxins that are fat soluble are expelled from the body through the bile via the stools.  <br>  <br>  If you don't like beets or just don't have time to eat them everyday, A-F Betafood from Standard Process is a great way to go.  The suggested dosage is 6 tablets per day, but depending on your situation you may need to go as high as 15 per day.<br>  <br>  Yours in Health & Wellness,<br>  <br>  Hiroyuki Nakamura<br>  Licensed Acupuncturist<br>  www.healthyonpurpose.com|`|G52lG34Jaa	There are many traditional herbal remedies that promote calmness.

kgE96Nhcaa	Breastfeeding is the best and easiest weight loss!  For $40 it seems like a waste of money.  What you can do is get a band just like that made for weight loss but not for "pregnant women" and try it out for 1/2 the cost. Again probably wont work (not a believer) but if you really want to give it a go, buy the one aimed at the general population.   They sell them in Target, Walmart etc in the exercise section.  That bellybandit is aimed at post-pregnancy and is priced like everything else to do with pregnancy - too high!|`|vsaaaSsAaa	It can't hurt, but I doubt it actually works.  <br>  <br>  You have to wait for your uterus to shrink down (muscle contracting) and your stomach muscles to tone up.  Just squeezing in everything doesn't have anything to do with muscle tightness. I would recommend crunches and core-toning.   (as long as you didn't have a c-section).
YDykVkcmaa	There is nothing that you can buy that will help with hair loss - so Mary is sending you to a site that will take your money and offer you no help at all.<br>  <br>  As has already been said, testosterone will actually increase hair loss. There are 3 general reasons why people lose hair:<br>  <br>  1/ Hereditary - you inherited the baldness from your parents - could even be your mom although she may never have been bald;<br>  <br>  2/ aging and<br>  <br>  3/ excess testosterone (which can also be an hereditary issue).<br>  <br>  The best way to reverse baldness (if it is a testosterone problem is to lower your testosterone but that can have other negative consequences such as laying down more fat, starting to get manboobs, voice gets a bit higher - in other words you start to become more feminine - the process of messing up the estrogen/testosterone balance in your body can be that you start to look more female like).<br>  <br>  Both males and females have testosterone and estrogen in their systems and if you mess with the balance you can start to look like the other sex.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Nooo.. in fact testosterone injections and gels make male pattern baldness more severe.

y5Ggaxf5aa	Cocoa butter|`|f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There is a lot of stretch mark treatment available on the market these days. Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin. It has a bioactive topical formula that has a combination of skin firming agents to reduce visible wrinkles and make skin appear firmer<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|p2605ETpaa	Fake tan, or sunbeds although i would suggest fake tan but the "this works - get rid of stretch marks" stuff on asos works a treat but its expensive.|`|kfvmQBbhaa	Try herbal treatments like Zenmed Stretch Mark Solution:<br>  <a href="http://zenmed.com/stretchmark?a=5881&x=click" rel="nofollow">http://zenmed.com/stretchmark?a=5881&x=c...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck ;-)|`|O9aaX9Vraa	I heard Palmers for stretch marks works pretty good. =]
tQO9LW8Qaa	You're not alone. A lot of people, particularly guys, start to smell bad after they go through puberty. When the smell is really bad and doesn't go away the condition is called Bromhidrosis and your doctor can help you deal with it. Your body odor can also change from stress and different foods, and, in rare cases, it can be a sign of a health problem that you didn't know you had. On Monday tell your doctor exactly what's going on and that it's stressing you out, and don't be afraid to talk to a counselor. You might find out that he or she has gone through the same thing.|`|e65d5944cf2f9d4c295f8eeeb30d8c5faa	Do you know that changes in body odor may be a sign of a medical problem? <br>   <br>  Can YOU smell whatever this is?  There are doctors who pride themselves on recognizing a disease by it's smell!  My son had an unpleasant odor even when he'd had a shower 30 minutes before, so I know it can happen.  He has outgrown it, though.<br>  <br>  (From the web site below - some things you might do-:)<br>  Change Your Diet - In some instances, body odor is greatly induced by the foods we eat. Our sweat glands excrete all types of bacteria and toxins. Some times, sweat glands also provide a good indication of what we had for dinner last night, or the night before. If suffering from a chronic body odor, which is noticeable by others, keep a food log. For example, people who consume a large portion of red meat may suffer from body odor. Secondly, eating a lot of garlic or onions may create a noticeable body odor. In this case, deodorants will not mask the odor. Other foods that contribute to body odor include alcohol, spicy foods, and caffeine.<br>  <br>  See a Doctor – There are times when chronic body odor precedes an illness. For example, some diabetes patients have complained of body odor. Moreover, individuals who have liver problems also experience an unusual body odor. If you have a digestive problem, an indistinct body odor or bad breath may be present. Women with cervical or uterine cancer may have a discharge, which causes a strange odor. If bathing or changing deodorants do not solve the problem, consult a physician. <br>  <br>  Switch Medications – If an over-the-counter or prescription medication has resulted in your sweat glands working overtime, consider switching medications. Because the sweat glands are working harder, the body is more likely to release more bacteria and toxins. The sudden increase may result in a strong body odor. <br>  <br>  (If it includes stinky feet, medicine to kill fungus - like Lotrimin or Tinactin - will stop the smell.)<br>  <br>  Hang in there, and don't let other people determine how you feel.  Just do the best you can to be your best self, and know that something Can be done to correct the problem, it's not because you asked for it on purpose!.  It might take some trial and error by the doctor, but when one thing doesn't work, he'll know to try a different route.  And if he doesn't know how to help you, ask him to recommend another doctor, possibly a skin doctor.   They can't all know everything, and some have interests in different fields. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|fQAjPXPAaa	If, as you said in your post which some people can't bother to read thoroughly, that you already shower and use deodorant and if, as your mother told you, other people rarely notice this smell, I have to guess this might be a mental thing. But maybe not depression, maybe more of an obsessive/compulsive issue? It's all related so I think you really need to tell your doctor that it is the THOUGHT of the smell that is bothering you, more than an actual odor. See if the doctor notices the smell.<br>  Maybe a school counselor could help, too?|`|dHYVE076aa	Wait your spiraling into depression because you smell?

You should tell your Mom so she can get you pads to protect your clothes and answer your questions.<br>  <br>  It is not unusual for girl's periods to be very irregular for the first couple of years.  They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.<br>  <br>  welcome to womanhood..

It's not going to be a big deal when you get older. There is no 100% positive way if you can tell if you will grow or not.. they claim to have tests by doctors, but they aren't 100% accurate, only a prediction.

ufgv7oTjaa	Well, "best" is a really relative term, mostly depending on what your body needs. The most popular doses tend to be at least 300 mg of a standardized extract that has at least 85-95% fatty acids.<br>  When it comes to prostate health, it is generally best to have a few more ingredients that help in addition to Saw Palmetto, though. Throwing in some Pumpkin Seed Oil, Lycopene, Beta Sitosterol, and some Nettles extract (from the root). Good luck and I hope I helped!
xUcjzYPdaa	Antidepressants lift your mood and enable you to function.<br>  <br>  You should take antidepressants for approximately a year. During that time, you should get counselling, eat healthily and exercise regularly.<br>  <br>  It could be that the depression is cured simply by the year of living without depression - it could be that it has run its course and won't come back.<br>  <br>  Counselling, diet and exercise all help prevent depression. They also help you to deal with it if it does come back.<br>  <br>  The idea that anti-depressants only exist to make money is ridiculous. Here in the UK, it's illegal for medications to be advertised. Doctors don't make money by prescribing medications. In fact, every prescription they make has to be budgeted for by the local Primary Care Trust. This means that if doctors' surgeries prescibe medications which aren't needed, they actually end up with less money left to spend. And guess what? Anti-depressants are still prescribed.<br>  <br>  These medications DO work. You need to be patient and you might need to try a few before you find the right one for you, but they do work, they help people and they save lives.|`|1JsWMX0daa	yes antidepressants work. depression is a real, progressive, and potentially deadly disease. medicine is not the only answer but is about 40% or more of the total solution. of course therapy helps both in group and one on one counceling.<br>   <br>   antidepressants try to stabilize the balance of natural chemicals in your brain and they try to stimulate your neurons to release more endorphins, chemicals that your brain secretes when you find something favorable to put you in a good mood.|`|LVTpUNqSaa	No their effect is not long term or permanent.

Perhaps you could see a knowledgeable psychologist to learn some stress reducing techniques and some behavior modification therapy.

If you are absolutely sure that you don't want any more kids there are no negatives to having a vasectomy.|`|LYeMqJIRaa	Hi,<br>     I must respectfully disagree (based on my experiences) with the first two responses posted. First of all as for taking ones manhood away that is all in ones mind.  As for the second comment as to no negative effects.. I wish that were true. I had mine done on June 5, 2008 and it was relatively uneventful until when the pain meds wore off and it felt like he was ripping my stomach out through my scrotum. Afterwards everything was not too bad until I tried it out 8 days later.  I  then discovered that I had lost (and still do not have) any sensation at ejaculation (almost 10 months now).  A few months later I developed prostate problems (turns out a common occurrence after the snip) and then after a few more months of pain (sometimes annoying, sometimes debilitating) I was diagnosed with a spermatocele (sperm no longer has anywhere to go so it swells up your epididimys like a balloon causing agony). I am still recovering from scrotal surgery I had  on 02/13 (guess how I spent Valentines Day) in an effort to stop the pain and am still waiting to see if it worked (Have to wait until the "new" surgery pain subsides to see if the old one is still there).   As much as I hated condoms I long for the good old "rubber" days .  Many guys have no problems and are happy with the results but I feel that the downside is under-reported (I didn't find out until too late).  Whatever your decision I just want you to have both sides and not just the ones the Urologist advertise promoting the procedure.

Another one.  I have had a terrible outcome personally, so obviously I'm biased against vasectomy.  In truth, the odds of a bad outcome like mine (chronic scrotal pain, medically-necessary reversal to stop the leakage and blowouts, etc.) are admittedly rare, but the research is all over the map.  I've read that as few as 1/10,000 develop chronic problems, and I've read that as many as 1/7 (15%) develop chronic problems.  <br>  <br>  Having been unlucky enough to draw the short straw, I can tell you that both my wife and I greatly regret the decision.  The chronic pain has made it difficult to be the man, father, and husband I was before the vasectomy.  Most evenings I'm confined to the sofa with an ice pack (and this is 4 years after the vasectomy and 2-1/2 years after the reversal).  I can't do any heavy lifting and have given up exercising because it really spikes the pain and inflammation.<br>  <br>  Maybe your husband won't develop Post-Vasectomy Pain Syndrome (PVPS).  But, if he does, it will wreck his life, your life, and those of your children.  Are you willing to make that bet?<br>  <br>  I urge you to research PVPS and to talk with an informed urologist that has researched the subject and actively treats vasectomy failures.  Dr. Witt in Atlanta, Dr. Pienkos in New Mexico, Dr. Marks in Tucson, Dr. Sabanegh at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Thomas in reproductive ethics at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Werthman in LA.  There are many.  Spend a few bucks and talk with one of them.<br>  <br>  They will at least help you understand that there are rare, but very real downsides to vasectomy.|`|1PXkhhzQaa	Not without reading about all possible outcomes. The best outcome is common - no sperm in the semen, and no noticeable long term pain.<br>  <br>  The worst outcomes are less common: <br>  "We have carried out a survey by postal questionnaire an telephone interview of 172 patients 4 years after vasectomy…Chronic testicular discomfort was present in 56 patients (33%)…. Prior to vasectomy, all patients should be counseled with regard to the risk of chronic testicular pain."<br>  <br>  "There is a small but significant incidence of CPTP [chronic post-vasectomy testicular pain] and patients should be warned of this possibility when counseled before operation."<br>  <br>  "In our study chronic scrotal pain was the most frequently reported complication of vasectomy with an incidence of 18.7%. Pain adversely affected quality of life in 2.2% of our study population. A review of the literature would suggest that techniques in which the epididymal vas is not ligated can reduce the incidence of post-vasectomy scrotal pain. Regardless of the technique used, the high litigation potential of this procedure warrants thorough counseling of the factors that may affect quality of life."<br>  <br>  "Congestive epididymitis [a synonym for post-vasectomy pain syndrome] was diagnosed in 6% of [6220] cases utilizing closed-end vasectomy and 2% of cases where the open-end vasectomy was performed. Open-end vasectomy is recommended because the incidence of congestive epididymitis is reduced."<br>  <br>  "Chronic epididymal pain following vasectomy is a well recognized clinical entity…. The post-vasectomy pain syndrome is a well recognized complication of vasectomy…. Reports of pain involving the testis and epididymis after vasectomy range from 3 to 8%…. Most urologists will encounter a significant number of patients with the post-vasectomy pain syndrome during their career…. The post-vasectomy pain syndrome is a rare but serious complication of vasectomy."<br>  "Spermatic granulomas are specialized abscesses which frequently occur at the site of vasectomy. Although some are often silent, others can be agonizingly painful. A series of 154 granulomas is presented. Of these, 83 were symptomatic and 63 required surgery for relief of pain."<br>  <br>  "A group…with a previously unappreciated syndrome of unremitting epididymal pain and induration 5 to 7 years after vasectomy was collected…. Recognition of this late post-vasectomy syndrome, which represents a major complication of vasectomy, might be expected to increase as cohorts of vasectomized individuals age…. Patient discomfort usually was constant, often disabling, exacerbated by sexual activity and, occasionally, radiating along the spermatic cord structures…. because the vasectomy procedure is so prone to medico-legal complications, we believe that the late post-vasectomy syndrome should be included in the informed consent form for vasectomy."<br>  <br>  I run a support group for men with chronic pain after vasectomy, so I have seen all of the worst outcomes. They all regret their vasectomy and say it was the worst decision they ecer made.|`|gQlnHuXEaa	Didn't work out well for me.

aOzyD45kaa	You should definitely ask him to get tested as long as you are willing to get tested, as well.  It is your health we're talking about.  If he really cares about he will get it done.  However, medical insurance will not cover these tests and a serum HIV test can run upwards of $300.  They now have over the counter oral tests for HIV which are practically as good as the blood test.  HIV takes 6-12 weeks to show up on the common blood test, so he needs to be only with you for that long.  In addition, to HIV, I would test for herpes, hepatitis C, and HPV.  He should know if he's had syphilis or gonorrhea, so I would NOT test for those.  The bottom line is this will cost you several hundred dollars out of your pocket, but it will provide you with peace of mind.  Hope this helps.|`|t3w3cDduaa	Tell him that you want to take it together, because you want to be responsible.  Just be straightforward and let him know its serious.

3t1iBGG6aa	SAM E should NOT be taken if you have depression. People with Manic Depression should be under the watchful eye of a doctor/psychiatrist. Same goes for people with bi-polar disorder or severe anxiety.<br>  <br>  SAM E is not a miracle worker or is it a drug. It's a natural anit-depressant, but it should not be used to TREAT depression. I have been taking it for a little over 2 months (400mg) and I asked my doctor beforehand because I used to take xanax in the past for my mild anxiety. She said it was okay and it may even help me, however if any sudden changes in mood/personalities, then she said I should report it right away. I can't say it has changed my life but I have stopped getting those awful moody days, it hasn't changed my anxiety whatsoever nor made me "happier" as some would think this does..<br>  <br>  Once again, this is not a medication. It's not for people with depression. Your case could be mild, moderate, or severe..only you know. If you're wondering what the difference are then here's what I've accumulated over the years from my doctor.<br>  <br>  Mild Depression = Blue days that can usually last anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months and cannot be shaken. Lost of appetite or sleep.<br>  <br>  Moderate = Lasts longer than 2-3 months. You feel like you're always trapped in a dark hole and cannot climb out. Tremendous difference in weight gain/weight lost. Mood swings can occur and everything is hopeless.<br>  <br>  Severe = This includes suicidal thoughts, can occur for years and without treatment will worsen. Very sluggish, irritable, overwhelmed with "life" and lost of motivation. <br>  <br>  Every person is different and depending on your severity, your doctor can recommend you to see a therapist. I think everyone on meds should be going to a therapist to talk about their issues as well, because most people just take pills without ever "talking" it out. It helps to talk with someone vs. taking meds alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|NuvKPl3naa	read the box as far as how much. i have asked my pharmacist and she said its such a low dose of ingredients that it may or may not help. i like you have been on all meds. i am now on cymbalta and i love it. but i know what you mean you dont want to drug yourself up. anyway that is what she told me.

Remember that it always helps to talk to someone about coping with stress, and to consider consulting your family doctor if the stress is getting too hard to handle. <br>  <br>  Do something that isn't work or something that is play-reading, community affairs, sports, hobbies, outdoor activities. <br>  <br>  Change your strategy: <br>  Decide what's worth worrying about and what isn't. <br>  Accept less than perfection. <br>  Take a break. Get away from the situation for a while. <br>  Get some exercise. <br>  Work harder. <br>  Talk to your friends about stress. <br>  Learn to separate school from the rest of your life; keep home and school separate. <br>  Drop what you're doing and do something completely different. <br>  Build up your resistance by getting regular sleep and regular exercise. <br>  Problem-solve. <br>  Re-label the stress. <br>  You determine the amount of stress you experience. It's a matter of how you look at things. Some things will be more stressful for you than others. The degree depends on how you interpret or "label" these things. <br>  <br>  Usually, you don't stop to analyze what label to put on something. Your "decision" is probably automatic and can produce stress before you even know what's happened. <br>  <br>  But, you can still reduce the stress by taking a second look, by "re-labelling" the stress. Re-labelling is simple, but it isn't easy, because it's tough to look at things from a different perspective  Hope this helps.|`|W29RO0jEaa	Wow...high school or middle school?<br>  Just have one day on the weekend to completely relax.<br>  Take a hot shower....dont hang out with friends just relax.<br>  Dont over-stress yourself.<br>  :)

There is a select few ppl that are immune to it there blood or something and survive and to make other ppl live they take the other persons blood and transfuse it into that person that is dieing of it. Now i saw this movie awhile ago and im going from memory so look this up first before using my knowledge..i hope i helped a little
SVuYaK8maa	Well I do yoga on the WII.  I only have some easy moving cloths and the WII. board,  Then a water bottle.<br>  <br>  So I would say you should get cloths you know you can do the stuff in.  Then a mat, with a water bottle.<br>  <br>  I would say that could run you any where from 30 to 100.00   Depends if you get the best of the best or just starters.  Then you can move on to the more fun stuff like the block and weight's.   Good luck and keep up the good work.  Don't give up.|`|fecUjSr1aa	just the mat and a hard surface and plenty of space to move about  so you don't knock down lampshades and stuff ..<br>  <br>  if you got carpet, then you don't need a mat ... if you're interested, a good yoga dvd is $15 ... thereabouts|`|3tZmTCbkaa	You don't need any equipment for Yoga.

It takes a good four years to establish, not four months. <br>  <br>  4.5" is slightly under for your age, but I would expect to see another inch by the time you are 18. Besides, Mother Nature seems to have compensated by giving you a forest. Presumably, you can ejaculate???<br>  <br>  Also, you might just be a tenor. Like me.

fBodY2Wsaa	First of all, calm down!  Its just a physical, and strictly busines.<br>  <br>  They will most likely ask if you have any aches and pains anywhere. <br>  then they do a buch of stupid test to make sure your capable of standing on one foot, ect.<br>  <br>  they might ask you to take off your shirt first, (mine does), then they check my heart beat and crap.  <br>  <br>  If they ask you to drop your pants, dont worry about anything.<br>  <br>  They just take a quick glance to make sure you have both your testicles, and your penis isnt falling off (not literaly).   <br>  <br>  Dont be shy or anything like that, its not like there going to examin it, take a picture, and print it in a newspaper or anything like that.   They see hundreds of penises a year,  no need to worry.<br>  <br>  --- If your concerned about getting hard or anything like that, dont worry.  If it happens it happends, thats just a part of life, dont get embarrised or anything, like I said, there doctors, they know that its just part of growing up, and most likely wont even mention anything about it.|`|xEGRedDBaa	If you are having a physical exam they will not assign you a girl. <br>  They will just hold your stuff and make sure there are no abnormal lumps. They will than ask you to turn your head an cough this is to test a certain muscle contraction or something I think, I don't know what the muscle is called though. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://tomwalt.com/category/family-health-care/" rel="nofollow">http://tomwalt.com/category/family-healt...</a><br>  <br>  They will check your acne status to see if you should start any types of medication or creams. And no, at your age they will not assume that you are sexually active so they will not ask you if you are.|`|E6DEJGI1aa	If he checks your prostate with both hands on your shoulders something is wrong.|`|a4IR6tYqaa	You will go into an examination room and you will either strip and put on a gown, or strip to your underpants.  They will take vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temp), listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears,  and check you over to be sure you are free from orthopedic problems (bones) including your neck down to your feet.  The doctor will probably push all over your abdomen and to the top of your pubic region while laying down.  You will stand up, drop your underpants and yes the doctor will probably check you for an Inguinial Hernia where she will put a gloved finger or two under you tesiticals and have you turn your head and cough a couple of times while she pushes up into the pubic region.  I would not be surprised if she also checks you for testicular cancer as it is a major concern in your age.  If you are uncircumcised she may pull back the foreskin to be sure nothing is going wrong there.  The doctor will gently feel both testicles with her finger tips and make sure there are no lumps or problems.<br>  <br>  There may be some lab work (blood/urine) and they will have you answer a bunch of questions (yes about being sexually active too) if you have not been to this doctor before and they do not have your records.  They will not check you for sexually transmitted infections unless you are sexually active and have symptoms.<br>  <br>  I am sure the doctor has done these a thousand times and it won't be a long thing at all.......maybe 30 minutes no counting wait time in the exam room.  If you are worried about getting an erection when she checks you that is not uncommon and it will not be a problem for the doctor and should not be for you.  At your age, if you are already entering puberty erections come all the time and you should not be embarressed if it happens.  There is no pain associated with anything but the needle stick IF they do blood work.  There really is not any a whole lot of time for you to think about it as the doctor should go through all this pretty quick.  Doctors have seen it all and are generally very concerned for your health and they can not talk about you outside the exam room as it is confidential.|`|KJmuHxcCaa	haha dude i know your pain i had the same thing except the girl doctor was super hot i was afraid i was going to get a little excited but all they do is they there hand on your sack and make u cough once or twice.

VlTGV9DUaa	ive read alot about boob growth and the contraceptive pill and read a question like yours and every girl said a different pill. <br>  what will make one girls boobs huge wont change anothers, coz we're all so different with different amounts of hormone etc. it'll have a completely different effect on each women, so you'll probably end up getting all different answers!<br>  eg.<br>  one of my friends boobs grew from a 34C to a 36G on Microlygnon, another of my friends didnt grow atall on that same pill.<br>  <br>  my boobs grew from a 34B to a 34D on Dianette, while my friends didnt grow atall when she was on that pill.|`|Y1LTzXataa	Levonorgestrol didn't make mine grow at all, if that helps|`|dZ03OJJxaa	Tri-Sprintec [cheap] made mine grow, but they always hurt now, cuz they're swolen.

itPGB0dXaa	I had a hydrocelotomy 2 weeks ago today and only since about 3 or 4 days ago did the swelling go down significantly. Its now at the point where its back down to pretty much normal size with no pain whatsoever. <br>  <br>  I'm still bandaged up since my recovery had complications but it is unrelated to what you have had done (though trauma sustained to the scrotum is similar in both operations). <br>  <br>  Unless there is unbearable pain after taking your prescribed painkillers or swelling increases further after the 3rd or 4th day it would be best to wait until your post-op checkup (usually about 1 week after surgery) and consult the doctor then if things haven't improved.<br>  <br>  Hang in there, you'll get through it eventually. Its one of the worst procedures to go through and the swelling and bruising is horrendous as you no doubt know already but it will get better, i assure you!|`|vr996LtZaa	The swelling is likely fluid buildup from the surgery. If it has not gone away after a few days, it may need to be drained.

LzJMaw2Iaa	My 4 year old stepson was just diagnosed with ALL as well.  Even though his care is covered by his mom's health insurance, we have received all sorts of information about non-profit groups that help fund treatment for children with leukemia and other forms of cancer.  It's definitely something you should be looking into and there is absolutely NO reason to feel ashamed or like you need to pay back the money from these non-profits.  That's what they're there for.  Then again, if you were able to afford all of the testing the confirm the type of leukemia then you should be good as far as the treatment as well.<br>  <br>  Also, I want to clarify something in your question.  You said you're worried that he won't survive the chemo.  First of all, there are other treats that the doctor may use in addition to or instead of chemo.  Second, chemo itself is perfectly safe although because it suppresses your body's immune system there will be a lot of rules to follow for the first 6 months or so to prevent illness and infection.  But the chemo itself is meant to kill off the cancer, not the person.<br>  <br>  Now, to answer your actual question about alternative treatments for leukemia, there aren't any.  You can make someone more comfortable with herbal medicines/plants such as marijana, but it will NOT make them better.  It will simply make the process of allowing the cancer to slow kill the person easier to endure.|`|2WyHgEcQaa	marijuana|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	Can't afford chemotherapy?

E6DEJGI1aa	Well, your forearm muscles, (sorry, I don't know their specific name) are used a lot along with your biceps, shoulders, back, legs if you have the bass drum with a pedal, you get a great cardio work out. I was told once that if you want to compare it to something then have a go at a punching bag, nonstop, for three minutes. You'll see what kind of workout you get.|`|FnDz57xRaa	forearms are used mostly.  core muscles and abs are used to stabalize the body.  legs are used but not really exercised that much. not as much as the arms are.  the shoulders are also used.  the hands and wrists get a real work out.  probably 100 calories burned every hour.  rock drummers might burn 200 to 300 during an intense concert

I didn't read a whole lot about... if its a surgery, some doctors may not do it uniless for a health reason and it will be hard to get your insurance to cover it.<br>  <br>  If that's the case, try colored contacts. You can get non-prescription colored contacts that you can always change the color to, BUT you do need to see an eye doctor to get them because they are not sold over the counter. One problem with colored contacts is that the point is to cover the iris with color, but because contacts' pupil holes don't change sizes but your pupil does so it might cause a little bit of a sight problem when your pupil gets bigger and there's a color in the way. I've never worn them myself but i've done a lot of research on them.|`|OWUBn7Praa	Any time you go under the knife - anything is possible.<br>  <br>  You could go blind (though that seems a lil extreme) Or you could seriously damage you tear ducts. <br>  <br>  My friend had lasik eye surgery and even though the procedier went EXACTLY AS PLANNED AND CORRECT her eyes didnt heal properly and she now her tear ducts are PERMANENTLY closed.

Then they unscrew the sides put the lens in, close the frames and screw them back together.

If they have screwed up twice already you may want to have a different optical center make your glasses.|`|0cuMP6bSaa	How have they messed up your lenses?  If the lens is simply popping out of the frame and they are just putting it back in, it could be that the original lens does not fit the exact shape of the frame.

1ExOGQ29aa	That is such a great question and like most of my clients, it can be frustrating to have one part of the body that seems at odds with others.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I would forget about the concept of "normal".<br>  <br>  If there is fat you want to lose, then that is okay and you should get some good information about how to do it effectively and naturally in a way you can enjoy it. But please don't get into the game of wondering whether something is ok or not.<br>  <br>  Our bodies will all have a natural tendency to deposit fat in a certain location of our body. That is natural.<br>  <br>  But what needs to be clarified is what you mean by a "big belly". Like is the abdomen area just protruding outwards a lot or is the midsection where a lot of fat is being deposited?<br>  <br>  Also there are two distinct shapes of a body when it comes to where fat is deposited. Apple and Pear shaped. Apple shaped bodies are where fat is stored in the midsection and pear is where fat is stored in the hip area.<br>  <br>  In the apple shape, there are three areas that cause a wide waistline: The subcutaneous fat (under the skin), visceral fat (fat in the body cavity and around the internal organs, and distended stomach, small intestines and colon.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do to reduce the size of the belly area is to get an analysis of what foods are causing you to build subcutaneous, visceral  fat and distended digestive organs.<br>  <br>  What I've found as a nutritionist is that low fat is not the way to lose fat. If the intake of fat is too low, the body will hold on to exissting fat. What is needed is to replace the "bad" fat with "good" fat and you will see your fat % drop. There are a number of other recommendations to change the shape of your body and lose body fat percentage.<br>  <br>   I'd be happy to give you some recommendations without charge to get you started on the right path. But it'd be a good idea to dispel the myriad of myths involved with fat loss and weight loss with my site. It is an informational site that gives loads of data that is pretty contrary to what is promoted simply because it is based on how the body has worked for hundred's of years.|`|LU96bnCdaa	well i think ur fine but if u need a bmi website here is one<br>  <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/</a>

syzjpE7Iaa	It's a form of herpes. Don't get scared its just a form and its common. So are styes. But anyways its a virus and there is no cure. It will just keep comming back there is no way to permanently cure it, but there a great product called abreva that's $20 for a small little vial but its good. For some reason I've only had one cold sore in my entire life and it was a really long time ago so it may have not been a cold sore, anyways just put some of that on and you can feel it tingling, soothing the cold sore over night.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  (don't feel emabarrased many people have them)|`|qqUvoC5uaa	My mother has gotten coldsores for nearly 40 years of her life. She's tried everything, don't waste your money on those expensive non working treatments. <br>  I know, kids are cruel, but there's nothing past things like herpacin that can really affect anything.|`|tsr8suCAaa	Im am in high school, and yes those do suck!<br>  <br>  It seemed like everyone was staring at it as I was going to my next class. The bad thing Is I had two right next to each other! :(<br>  <br>  What I used was the Orajel over night patches and a thing called Lysine+. Definitely get those two things.|`|kfvmQBbhaa	For cold sore, you can follow these tips:<br>  <a href="http://hits.affiliatetraction.com/cgi-bin/redir?pd_link=i1-a32289-o2083-c21081" rel="nofollow">http://hits.affiliatetraction.com/cgi-bi...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck ;-)
AA10450066	It sound like the steam in the shower is causing a chain reaction with your temperature and blood pressure.It's time for you to go and get some help from the doctor.Fever is telling you there's an infection in your body.Wake up and get to the doctor!|`|PvQCD9Aaaa	go to a doctor. antibiotics are your best bet, because you have some sort of infection is you have a fever|`|VzxWweU0aa	when you get a fever it's your body tryng burn out any illness you may have. If you temp is below 103 you should just let it run it's course because you have it for a reason, but it increases you need to see a doctor.  I think that you should probablly be seen anyway just because it's lasted so long.  But in the meantime you can try taking theraflu or something to see if you fever breaks, sometimes when that happens it wont return.   I don't know of just one thing that could be related to a fever, there's many possiblilties so i suggest talking to a doctor.
Sozc3MyFaa	If you are referring to a pasturella infection (there is some question over the exact cause of the black plague), it is a bacteria & now it can be treated by antibiotics.  In the middle ages, it died out as susceptible individuals died, and those left had antibodies.  Fires (the great fire of London) also decimated the rat population which was the source of the fleas.|`|10zHV2thaa	it still exist in some 3rd world country i saw a little boy with it in a pic
7AnjBa5Baa	shes just worried<br>  it is true you can get a disease called TSS [toxic shock syndrome]]<br>  i did a report on TSS<br>  and its VERY rare<br>  just dont leave your tampons in more than 4 hours at a time and change them every so often|`|NuvKPl3naa	no that is not true. there is a thing called toxic shock syndrome, but that is when you leave your tampon in for too long can usually cause this. they do make different size tampons for your flow. but its no harm.|`|S1jddreQaa	No that's stupid. Tampons can give you TSS, if you leave them in to long. (more then 8 hours...I change then every 4-6 to be safe) Its really rare. Your mom should get facts before she freaks..|`|bqisLny9aa	the only thing you can get from a tampon is TSS. you can't get cancer from a tampon. lots of girls wear tampons during the day and wear pads at night. it's safer that way if you sleep longer than 8 hours.|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	No, this isn't true at all. Your mom is either misinformed or is lying to you.|`|8315887d554145b1a660159c25969950aa	no. tampons cannot give you cancer|`|961e1fe88a95f0b9b8011e95c339a287aa	No, tampons will not give you cancer. But, you should however, be careful when using tampons and always use the lightest absorbency for your needs. There is a slight risk that you could develop what is known as TSS or toxic shock syndrome from tampons. I know it sounds dorky, but read the little pamphlet that comes in the tampon box...it has alot of important and useful information. You should alternate tampons with pads occassionally to try and avoid any ill-effects of tampon usage.|`|IkB1OyjCaa	I am not really sure why your mom said this because it's not true. What you can get is TSS, which is toxic sydrom. You only get if you wear the same tampon for longer than 12 hours at a time and it's very rare.|`|wSqq4gSBaa	Some what true. Tampons have  side effect but not on everyone um not sure if it's cancer or not. When u open the box it has instructions it explains everything 2 u.|`|aixCXQ8Gaa	ummm, I'm pretty sure tampons don't give you cancer haha<br>  You can how ever get toxic shock syndrom from leaving them in for like 8 hours or something|`|zsOj9Ac0aa	Never heard of cancer, but if you dont change them every few hours, no more than 8 hrs at a time you can get TSS toxic shock syndrome!! and get sick, some people have died, so change it often!!!|`|1aJjFrUCaa	lol tampons can't give you cancer lol. maybe she was talking about the toxic shock sydrome! but u cant get that from leaving them in all day.|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	No. Deffinitely not true. Just make to change your tampon every 4 hours or so.|`|rtU5iTZAaa	ummmm...<br>  NO, thats the STUPIDEST thing i have ever heard!|`|nmOOhjRsaa	hahaha me and my friend WERE just talking bout this today! everything will be all right as long as you dont leave them in too long. if you look inside the tampon box there should be a piece of paper with all sorts of info if you want proof!
63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Have you thought of buying the CVS home health test, to see what your results look like.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	haha get someone else's pee and put it in the cup as yuor own pee|`|yoHbF7q7aa	I heard that drinking tons of red cranberry juice will flush your system.|`|7beddafd9e3e5b6f866d287e651374a4aa	drink lots of water and take vitamins
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you cut it yourself, you run the risk of infection, which could get really bad down there.  If it just got broken, it may just dry up and come off by itself.  If not, you really should see a doctor, who can numb the area and remove it in more sanitary conditions.  <br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|S1jddreQaa	ow! don't do that! Go see a doctor if its bothering you!|`|Rx0ae0suaa	Don't cut it! Not only would it probably hurt like anything, but you could give yourself an infection.|`|7AnjBa5Baa	GOD PLEASE DONT! <br>  i cut something down there, and i bled so much and it hurt like crapp!|`|AaXl5YYkaa	ouch|`|bqisLny9aa	oh my..|`|DUa16Ka4aa	God No,<br>  Even a cut down there hurts like a b-word.<br>  D:<br>  Go see your gyno.|`|Ih2Nov0Eaa	don't cut it! ouch!|`|gX40pgLyaa	Go 2 a doctor
1DJOxWZSaa	You have mononucleosis, or 'mono'. It's a common viral infectious disease that is transferred by saliva, mucus, and in rarer cases even tears. The cause is a virus called Epstein-Barr virus. Usually only self-care is used to treat mono. Get plenty of rest and take acetaminophen. Use throat lozenges to soothe your soar throat. If your symptoms get worse go to the ER, and corticosteroids may be prescribed.
NuvKPl3naa	well to be safe i would go. sounds like no blood is getting to your finger. good luck
PAvYZJK2aa	it does hurt and not sure about how they do it|`|i6RlYFo7aa	of course it hurts<br>  i saw a video of it and i almost died<br>  <br>  they strap a baby to this seat thingy and cut off the skin on his penis and it's horrible|`|srUuoCwcaa	It always hurts (no matter what age it's performed at)... Furthermore, it's unnecessary. There are topicals usually applied, however, to ease the pain. They are not always very effective, but I'm sure it's better than nothing. To see first-hand, go to youtube or somewhere. Watch some different age groups. It can be quite brutal (then again, the whole practice is). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|5yCdBRjiaa	dude i have the same question on my profile, check my profile and look for that question, i asked it. you will find some good info there.|`|gAuIixm6aa	My ex was circumcised when he came to America at age 13 and he said it hurt quite a lot. Also, it permanently scarred his junk.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	google it|`|dOpKsNYcaa	It always hurts babies (although they don't remember later on) because they usually don't use any anesthesia and if they it's usually just a topical it only doesn't minimize the pain very much, but if you are an adult they will usually put you under general anesthesia first so the surgery won't hurt at all. But the recovery process does hurt for a while.|`|uzklwDm8aa	Im 16 years old and i just got circumcised yesterday. it didnt hurt not one lil bit!!! i was so suprised cuz i thought it was gonna hurt so bad. da only thing is dat it bleeds alot but if u take Tylenol with codine it wont even bother you. im not sure if its different for certain people but im glad i did it because it doesnt hurt.<br>  <br>  first they give u a medicine dat basically gets u high. then dey put u on anestasia and numb da penis area so dont even worry about it man|`|ZvyvETTsaa	if you r not a baby then it wont hurt.. someone i know got his a year ago and it didnt hurt like he thought.
AA10330684	GPC is not Pink Eye like the above answer said, GPC is an allergic ocular disease that its mainly due to wearing contact lenses. They look like these little bumps inside your eyelids,<br>  <br>  So its normal to have your eye droopy because its heavy and swollen so it weighs it down since the skin around the eye is really really!! thin|`|AA10920990	'Pinkeye'  Ouch!   Been there, done that. My eye felt like it slipped down the side of my face.I don't know anything about Alamast, but I do know it takes several days before your eye feels better. Be sure you wash your hands often. Change your wash cloth and towel every time you use one. And you pillowcase, too.Be very aware of what you touch and keep everything as clean as you can. It's really easy to infect your other eye and your significant other, too. Good luck.  Hope you feel better soon.
