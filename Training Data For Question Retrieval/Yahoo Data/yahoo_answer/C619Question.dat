20070821130801AArNxkv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Quién entiende :(?	Hola ps, les cuento mi problema. Hace un tiempo que conocí a un chico por Internet (vivimos super lejos), y él empezó a portarse super lindo conmigo , hablábamos todos loas días, le decía a todo mundo que estaba enamorado de mi. Ponía en su pagina mi foto y tenía detalles muy lindos. Yo al principio no quería nada con él, sobre todo xq acababa de salir de uan relación que me hizo sufrir mucho. Pero con el tiempo empezé a sentir cosas por él al punto de enamorarme. Cuando empezé a portarme mejor con él y a tener detalles, de pronto cambió conmigo y me dejo de hablar como 2 semanas. Ahora q he vuelto a hablarle, me dice, no importa q te haya dejado de hablar verdad? siempre seremos amigos.   La cosa es que me siento muy mal xq no lo entiendo, no entiendo como pudo cambiar de la noche a la ma?ana. Y xq cambió!! alguien me puede ayudar?

20071030144051AAMz3vL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He never calls me, unless he's returning my phone call.?	To begin, i'm doing sumthing i never thought I would do, dating a younger guy. I'm 20 he's 19. It was weird at first but after spending time with him  became comfortable with the decsion.  We agreed that we were a couple. We had sex, he stopped calling.The only time we spend time is when I intiate it. Other than that I will not hear from him. And where we do spend time he's either playing with my MP3 player, goind threw my cd's, playing my video games...etc. I have 2 make the first call, I have to suggest the date, I have to suggest that we spend time. If not I'm  honestly afraid I will never see him. Look, i have had nothing but rotten luck with love, I've had one relationship that made me happy and he ended up getting murdered. This is only the 2nd guy who in the beging showed a genuine intrest in me, I dont understand.... Just What am I doing wrong?

20080204143546AALl2SY	Family & Relationships;Family	Ma mère et moi : des avis?	Mes relations avec ma mère sont bonnes, je l'aime, mais en fait je ne la supporte pas. Disons que nos choix de vie sont opposés et que je lui reproche (sans rien dire... pour éviter d'interminables conflits) encore beaucoup de choses, même si ce n'est pas de la rancoeur, plut?t un profond désaccord. Disons aussi qu'il est assez dur de vivre à ses c?tés, j'imagine qu'on l'a prouvé dans ma fratrie.    Alors ma question : est-il socialement acceptable de ressentir cela pour sa mère, de la distance, de l'énervement à son contact ? Ou faudra-t-il toujours que je le cache et fasse comme si de rien n'était ?    J'ai l'impression qu'il faut plut?t avoir honte si on n'est pas copine et admirative avec sa mère.

20080624221737AAizbeh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Perchè in fondo sei tu che mi coccoli e poi ti diverti a cambiare programmi...?	Buongiorno,   (si fa per dire).    Ho il morale a terra, ma più a terra della terra stessa, più sotto... :\   La colpa è sua, di lui che non ha capito che dell'amore non bisogna avere paura, non ha capito che i legami non sono catene e non ha neanche capito che io voglio che lui ci sia sempre e non a momenti. La mattina c'è, il pomeriggio fa qualche comparsa e la sera sparisce nel nulla. Io voglio sicurezze in questa vita ricca di incognite e lui che può darmele fugge, perchè ha paura. E' successo tutto il 23.06, c'è stato qualcosa tra noi, baci, coccole e quelle parole:"Ti dico solo una cosa, non affezionarti troppo a me". Ma come diamine si fa?   Ieri sera aveva detto che forse ci vedavamo, ma non un messaggio, non una telefonata. Stamattina ho deciso di mandargli un sms e dirgli:"O ci sei, oppure no...senza mezze misure perchè tu sei quello che ha paura di soffrire, ma a farlo sono io"      Farei la cosa giusta?       http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnLTZC6x-...

20080917074151AANKzEM	Family & Relationships;Weddings	L'importanza della puntualità...ma anche di uguali doveri!!?	Io e la mia ragazza abbiamo avuto un diverbio, ieri sera, riguardo al discorso "puntualità":      LEI: sostiene che io, a differenza sua, devo essere sempre puntuale quando la vado prendere....e che se ritardo anche solo di 10 minuti, facendola aspettare, non è sinonimo di galanteria. Altre volte capita che se è lei quel giorno a prendere la macchina per venirmi a prendere, lei può tardare anche di mezz'ora, io invece devo aspettare...      IO: sostengo, invece, che siccome la donna ha voluto pari diritti agli uomini, anche lei non deve sempre farmi aspettare mezz'ora sotto casa, perchè anche l'uomo (come la donna), può semplicemente rompersi i maroncelli!! Inoltre, quasi sempre quando mi viene a prendere lei, ritarda almeno mezz'ora....Se le dovessi chiedere di venirmi a prendere per un mese, si accumulerebbero centinaia di ore di ritardo da parte sua!   Infine, se vengo in ritardo, lei non scende subito, ma mi fa aspettare ancora.    Io le ho detto che se un uomo per galanteria dev'essere puntuale, la donna deve esserlo per l'uomo per una questione di "educazione"....perchè non mi deve venire a fare tutti quei discorsi tipo "Tutti siamo uguali, e abbiamo uguali diritti e valore".....oppure "Io odio il maschilismo!", e poi mi fa sto ragionamento retrogrado femminista!!      Nulla da ridire sul fatto "Lei aspetta in una piazza, ed io ritardo!!": lì dev'essere davvero l'uomo ad arrivare prima (se nn anche in anticipo).....per non farla aspettare tutta sola....Ma qui si tratta di aspettare a casa!!      Dite la vostra!

Well idk what happened but we started talking a little less about a week ago, and she broke up with me on saturday. She said it was because with school and her dance we wont be able to see eachother enough, and it isnt fair to either of us. At first i was fine but now im just like i really think i need her.   So my question...What do i do? I feel terrible. Ive tried to keep busy but i can not keep her off my mind.   thanks guys

20080825172434AAdQ50w	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Mi sento preso in giro dalla mia ragazza!!!! :-(?	Salve a tutti,ho 18 anni e ho un problema sentimentale che mi sta facendo impazzire. Ho conosciuto una raga di 17 anni, più o meno 5 mesi fa, abbiamo da subito iniziato a frequentarci, e dopo un mese ci siamo fidanzati, purtroppo un  suo gravissimo problema familiare l'ha costretta a lasciarmi per circa un mese, durante il quale abbiamo completamente perso il contatto,anche se da come diceva lei mi amava alla follia. improvvisamente un giorno si fa sentire dicendomi che   era pronta a rincominciare, io entusiasta, perchè ero veramente preso da lei,rincomincio a frequentarla, il sabato successivo, mi scrive dicendomi che era andata a letto con un ragazzo, lo stesso che le aveva applicato violenza all'età di 15 anni, violenza, che si è molto ripercossa sul nostro rapporto, in quanto era molto restia ad ogni tipo di contatto fisico, anche solo di baci o abbracci.mi ha chiamato in lacrime, dicendomi che era dispiaciuta e che voleva che la perdonassi, perchè era stata solo una scappatella. Io a malincuore, l'ho perdonata, e ci siamo rimessi insieme;tempo 1 mese che mi lascia di nuovo, dicendomi che vi erano dei tizi che le impedivano di fidanzarsi con qualcuno(a mio avviso una balla), dicendo che mi amava comuque.la settimana successiva si rifà sentire, dicendomi che se ne erano andati, e chè era pronta a ricominciare, ma improvvisamente la mattina successiva, mi dice che vuole rimanere amica, perchè mi ama troppo e non vuole soffrire ancora.....non riesco a capire cosa le prende, sto impazzendo!!! Help please

20081023021207AAlq7oR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How important is "me time" in a relationship/marriage?	My girlfriend and I have recently been discussing the importance of "alone time" or "me time" in our relationship. We noticed that we were both feeling a tad smothered from being together all the time. We then realized that after we each had some alone time (a few hours or so) to do what we each wanted to do in a day, that our petty fighting is now non-existent, which is great.      So my question is: How important do YOU think alone time is in a relationship, and how can you carry that over into a marriage? Is it harder to do? I would love some answers from personal experience if at all possible.      Thanks in advance!         -Mike

20081021132301AAHwOLy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's the point in being married if most people cheat?	I don't understand what the point of marriage is if most people are going to cheat anyway.  People always make excuses that we're biologically meant to be with other people.. so what's the point?  I don't know now, why we should risk our feelings and trust unconditionally if maybe later on we're going to be hurt by the person we trust the most.  And I know both genders cheat, i'm not saying men are the bad guys here.  Also, I've noticed that men cheat, then they're doing anything they can to get back w/ the wife.. so what's the point??

20081022060839AAedmnS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Whats the point of marriage for men?	One guy said      "He makes alot of sense men make all kinds of sacrifices. We stay in jobs we hate just to pay the bills. While our wives dream of their perfect job. We work all day the come home an help clean a home an watch the kids. "An yes we don't mind the kids their our flesh an blood."?      -Men make sacrifices and support women who go back to school. Why dont women do the same for men? Or encourage him to find a more interesting/emotionally fulfilling career and encourage him to work less hours      -On top of that we're expected to be less emotional when we are just as emotional. We need to be strong during a crisis and take care of it while the woman cries in a corner. Women should be the emotional caretakers in my opinion.      -Men actually work longer hours. Men work on average 37 hours at a job and 16 hours of housework. Women work 24 hours on average and 27 hours of housework. Final Result=53 hours vs . 51 hours               It seems marriage just makes men tired, stay in jobs the hate,  while women get their dream jobs. Men dig themselves into an early grave by working while the woman gets to enjoy her time with the kids and family. Women also get more nights out with their friends. And the double standard of men should do 50% of the cooking, pay for dinner and not expect women to do any manual labor. Men emotionally destroy themselves by getting married. not to mention women always TAKE MORE THAN THEY GIVE.

20090205013008AApVjgM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	When to Hold and when to fold a relationship?	Ive been with my girlfriend for almost three years, and it has simply been the best of times combined with the absolute worst of times. But the thing is we always work it out.  But now since we have been living together she has become a double personality person.        She is either so loving and soft or becomes the most combative , demanding, argumentative person i have ever met in my life.  I feel like im living with a hawk with a microscope, and everything i do in the house is under constant "WATCH". Take your shoes off, do the dishes, but what bothers me most is not that petty stuff.      its every time I say anything or feel anything she almost always challenges me, opposes me, or is opinionated in a negative manner.  Its to the point that its breaking us up. I told her I need you Not to ever say to me.      YOu should   you need to    you better       but she continues to talk in this demanding , combative , argumentative tone with me.  when we do fight  she pulls out stuff from years ago and throws it in my face with so much rage.      have you ever seen a hundred and ten lb girl going ballistic? its a crazy site like a wild animal. and she raises her voice all loud in the apt to sound so righteous.        I feel so lost, we worked so hard to stay together, but i dont think i could give up my right to exist and function as a unique individual with his own thoughts feelings and beliefs.  Im thirty one ( a bit more experienced in life and relationships , even though she is twenty six.        One friend once told me girls are b ig on you SHOULD, and woman are big on accepting .        we are slated to move to ca together and at this rate its falling apart worse than its ever been? im afraid of getting into a situation in ca where she will become even more controlling , demanding, combative and authoritative,      its like then shes the complete oppossite to. so its so hard.  (it not a bipolar thing im descrbibing her its more of a explosive personality iguess just different.

20090204170143AAPZ5VC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need adult answers to this relationship problem?	I'd been dating this great guy. We're both around 40. We had several dates and he never kissed me. I got concerned and brought it up. I mentioned it lightly, but I think he felt cornered, and nothing has been right since. There was definitely sizzle between us, and he talked a lot about things we'd do in the future. All was great. Just nothing physical!       Now it's been about two days. I feel like I ruined it. Part of me wants to wash my hands of all of it because I've had so many bad relationships. But he's a keeper. I don't want to throw away a good chance. I can't tell if he's missing me or if he even wants to talk to me. I'm terrified to call him. I'm also wondering if I should wait for him to call me. I can't stop thinking about it - what should I do?

20090205015244AApWuNK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think I'm a bad person really?	So i went throw a divorce. To make things clear i am not a whore! I was in a arranged marriage and a virgin before i was married. He cheated on me when we where newly Wed's. He had a complain about everything. Then he wanted a divorce, so now I'm dating. I went on a couple of bad dates. I asked for good advice on this matter of how men think. The last thing i need is for someone to think I'm a whore cause i date and  not in a commitment. The last Question i asked about was Mr. Right got some bad response. Do you really think I'm a whore? I don't think so. I haven't been asked to go steady. Why is it that when a women talks about her sex life a man always takes it the wrong way? And they hate it if shes better in bed then him! Again what should i do to find a good man and he doesn't have to be rich. He just has to be clean body, mind ,and soul. I'm a pieces so for me love is eternal.I want a man who is brave,passionate and make me laugh when i feel sad. Men all listen up! Men who are players never get married. And when they go past age 40 they feel guilty. A college professor said" more sin are made because of men. Women don't start off evil. I know there are good guy out there. But why are they so shy? This guy kissed me on the forehead and i felt young again. He made me blush. But I'm afraid of getting close.Are there married or couples that can tell me how to handle a relationship?  How i can forget and move forward?

For the 5 months that I broke up with my girlfrien because she cheated on me while drunk i got involved with this sweet, classy girl. she doesnt do drugs and has good morals and stuff.      but then my gf came back in the picture.. n i remembered how much i loved her..so i took her back      and i never gave the classy girl a chance.. i did have feelings for her.. its just once my ex came back.. i sort of forgot about her      shes sad that i never gave her a chance and thinks im making a mistake by going back to my ex...      what do you think? the girl im with now isnt anything like the classy girl..she said she went to counselling for her drinking problem and is different.. she lost her virginity at 13.. she isnt against me doing drugs where as the classy girl is.. and i just think that we're more alike, being with the classy girl would require me changing my drug/party lifestyle.. but with tis girl its different

I am a decent looking 21 year old guy imo and I have been single for years and it really hurts me.      I always seem to get to the phone number exchange stage of a relationship and never get any further.      I have been talking to this girl for a few months online recently and we was going to meet up over the next few days and I thought we were doing good and all of a sudden it all turned cold and now we don't even know if we should keep talking.      I don't know what i'm doing wrong and why I can't find a relationship. I am very friendly and genuine but for some reason cupid won't shoot his arrow in my direction.

For at least 5 - 6 months now i have fallen in love with this girl, she means literally the whole world to me. Shes Beautiful, Wonderful, Amazing, and everything that is great in the world. But i have had some recent thoughts, should i tell her i love her? On one hand i think yeah i should tell her, and on the other hand i think that may not be such a good idea because it could ruin our friendship. Also i think this other guy likes her and makes it twice as difficult because i want to tell her i love her first but cant. Please tell me what i should do =[      This Girl Does Mean Literally Everything To Me.
20090204164654AA7ij4X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my life's lesson to never open my heart again?	My boyfriend left me. I'm in so much pain I can't even sleep or eat since Saturday. Our relationship was great at the start (6 years ago) then it got rocky due to commitment issues (not cheating, but how committed to the relationship we were, how sure we were about it). And then I decided that it's really not going anywhere unless I commit or un-commit. So I've pondered the decision - walk away from it completely or give it my best shot. I've made a choice to put my best effort in it, do it 100%, be there for him, communicate my wishes but not demand, not walk away on him when we have an argument, cook for him, find the time to be with him. And in the end he told me we should go separate ways cause "he can't love me the way I deserve to be loved."   I've never felt so hurt and devastated before. I've lost relationships before, when I was less interested in them. It was painful and unpleasant, but manageable. This time I'm really in love with the person. Yet he pushed me away. How can I recover from this one without putting a brick wall around my heart?       Yes, I still love him dearly and want to be with him if he changes his mind. We are going to see each other tomorrow for logistical reasons. I don't want to make him feel like I'm chasing him.       I'm in counselling every day, but I'm getting worse not better. Their goal seems to be to make sure I don't kill my body, but it doesn't matter to them what happens to the rest of me.    I'm 36 y.o.

20070708161213AAZGLdI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Creen en las relaciones a distancia?	Tengo un amigo que vive en el Norte, yo soy del sur y solo podemos vernos una o dos veces al a?o. Siempre hemos sentido atracción el uno por el otro, pero la distancia que nos separa es muy grande. Además, él es 6 a?os mayor que yo y seguramente busca una relación seria que de verdad funcione y tenga futuro, entonces, para que ninguno saliera lastimado, preferí olvidarme de él pero es muy difícil porque hablamos por chat siempre y lo quiero demaciado. Pero, a pesar de que no veo que resulte, siento que él es el indicado para mi y llevo mas de 2 a?os sin salir con ningún otro hombre por seguir creyendo que esto puede resultar.

20070801034322AASkxX3	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Pornografia e gelosia?	Apparentemente questi due termini non c'entrano molto...ma pensateci bene: un'attrice porno dopo aver girato due scene in cui ha fatto sesso con 5 uomini torna a casa dal proprio maritino che l'aspetta per una cena romantica. Ma è possibile? Come fa il partner di un attore/attrice hard a non essere geloso? O almeno schifato dal fatto che la persona che ama abbia appena "scopato" con 3-4-5 sconosciuti!   Sarà anche un lavoro e molti dichiarano che sul set si fa sesso solo con il corpo e non con la mente...ma io personalmente non riuscirei a legarmi ad un'attrice hard. E voi?

20090204165109AAyd4Fu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why would you/do you cheat on your partner?	There's a reason for my question:   I currently found out my best friend's dad cheated on her mom. Now, my best friend is one of those ppl that seem to have the perfect family everyone wants. They seemed fine all the time, I never thought her dad would cheat on her mom.       Interestingly, I've met the "other woman", who is my friend's dad's co worker. I was shocked he had a relationship with that woman- shes so much older and uglier than my friend's mom. I'd at least figure he'd pick a younger prettier woman. I don't know the other woman well enough, but I know my friend's mom is really nice and a really good person. So that's why I have to ask this question:      Why would anyone cheat on his/her spouse?   Especially if they have such a perfect family at home like my friend's family?      I'd really like to get some insight about this.   Thanks to all who respond :)

20090204170345AAh7oEA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is depressed, creating problems out of boredom? wants to take solo vacation.?	Our relationship is mostly happy and we are very close. My husband said he first felt depression as a child. He was on Prozac 2 years ago, but not currently. Throughout our relationship he's had a difficult time dealing with work related stress. He quit working for someone else all together and started his own business, which is currently making no profit.       With no work right now, I know he's bored and frustrated because we don't have much money and since its winter, we aren't getting out as often as we would like to. He is visibly agitated and it doesn't take much to make him cross. Today he wanted to go camping but would leave me early the next morning to go golfing with a friend, so throughout the coldest part of the day, I would be hanging out in a tent with our little dogs. One is hairless so I would spend my time trying to keep her warm 'till he returned. I also have this brain issue that contributes to very poor circulation; I get really, really cold. Anyway, not fun for me.       Later in the day he was very grumpy that I didn't want to go camping, though he was the one to tell me it would probably be too cold for our little family and we should wait for warmer weather. I said I would go, he said no. I don't feel at all at ease with the way his stress/depression is manifesting its way into our relationship. We have been married just 1 year though our relationship spans 9 total.       Earlier this morning we had an issue because he wants to spend two days at  http://www.breitenbush.com/  hotsprings. He asked if it was OK with me and if I would take care of our dogs while he went. This would be the weekend before his annual 7 day road/camping trip w/his friend. I told him this solo hot springs trip made me uncomfortable. He's very angry that I'm uncomfortable with him going alone. I feel like he's just searching for ways to stay entertained, even to the detriment of our relationship. I was really hurt after he became so aggravated. I told him I would go w/him when we find someone to stay with our dogs and that I would do my own thing while we were there. That didn't make him feel better.      What else? He is 40 and I am 27. He gets angry if I suggest finding a job or if I suggest anything he might do with his time. I love that he does his own stuff. I always encourage him to camp, raft, go to football parties and bars (even the naked ones!) when his friends want to go. I like his group of buddies; I cook for all our gatherings... I encourage him to go to the gym and take classes, buy books and research what interests him. He often takes 4 or 5 flights a year to visit family and friends without me, which is great. I never want to inhibit his growth or education but I think it's OK for me to make my own limits known.       Breitenbush might be fun to explore, but as a couple. We’re married. I know he's super sad lately and that makes me even more uncomfortable with his vacation idea. How do I fix this without being a nag or a prude or a selfish woman? Part of me was sad that he wanted to go have this experience without me. It would never cross my mind to go to some little naked oasis without him. I'm kinda sensitive and I know he isn't. Now I feel sort of depressed myself! Like I missed something important or I acted wrong. He is just so unhappy.       What would you do? What should I do?

I as a Christian, legally divorced my hsbnd, we fought alot verbally and physically, however....?	there was no adultery committed.  after our divorce, he really made significant changes in his personality but i refused to reconcile with him.  i eventually committed adultery with a co worker and ran off with him.  this hurt my husband's heart very bad, was i wrong to be insensitive to his wanting to reconcile?  i just felt like i had had enough and it didn't matter how much he had changed.  he fnally let me go....  i was a practicing Christian, but now i am not because of what happened.  was i wrong for leaving our marriage as a Christian when my ex husband wanted to make our marriage work?    honesty, please!

20090204191254AAe1Vyc	Family & Relationships;Family	How do i convince an unreasonable person to change their mind.?	The reason I am asking this is because today i was kicked off my improv team reason being i missed too many practices, one as a mistake two because no one told me there was one and a few due to appointments. This is ridiculous. For this team I studied theory on my own for hours on end in preparation for my audition but because of a few miss-communications and medical appointments im cut. Tomorrow I have a chance to plead my case to my less than friendly female captain who seems not to take kindly to grade nines. I am at a loss of words, usually I pick apart the faults in a ruling (say of a teacher) but this one is just so blatantly obvious! How do I show her I am committed to the team but with out sounding rude. She also knows that I was not informed of the last two practices but chewed me out on both instances. Id really like a well thought out intelligent response to this. We also have the provincial championships in one week, they will need to find a replacement for me.

I get up with her in the morning for school, I help her with her homework, I make sure she has eaten dinner for the night, I pick her up from her after school program, i drive her to her dances and pick her up, she confides in me and we have a great time together, she even asks me if she can go out to play rather then her own mom. My mom couldnt even buy her any gifts for x-mas cuz she spent the money on god knows what. I bought her more stiff for x-mas then our own mom.

I want this to end but I dont want my sister to end up in foster care.

20090204183431AA90vbr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Don't you agree that you should get your wild side out before you get into a relationship with someone?	One of my ex boyfriends is wanting me to take him back.  The thought never crossed my mind to take him back, first of all because we didn't have much of a relationship before.  He just doesn't know how to be in a relationship in my opinion.  Our "relationship" was more like a booty call.  And that's not what I want.   Now he claims he's still in love with me, that he never stopped loving me, etc.  But he wants to have an intimate night with multiple women.  And keeps asking me to find him some hot women so we can all have fun.  Well, I have told him my feelings on the whole issue and about my lack of desire to enter into a relationship with him again when it didn't work out the last time.  I never asked to be first priority in his life (I'm not that demanding) but somewhere above clipping his toenails would have been nice.   Anyway, my question is, do you consider it acceptable to talk about having a multiple partner night of "fun" when earlier in the conversation you claimed you love that person and want to get back with them?  It seems to me, if you had the desire to do something along those lines you would do it before you got into a relationship with someone (or talked about getting into a relationship).  Shouldn't you get your wild hairs out before claiming to want a relationship with someone who isn't into that sort of thing?

20090204224303AA3GirJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Argument with my dad- who is right?	My parents are divorced and according to court order I am supposed to go down there every thursday night and friday night and every other saturday and sunday. So It's not like I don't get to see him a lot. Now, he lives in san Clemente which is about an hour from anaheim. Is it wrong of me to not feel like going down there?      Well I told him that I didn't feel like it, and he got very angry and stubborn. "Everyone makes sacrifices." He holds the fact that he makes the money over my head and I am only 16 years old. I don't even know what to do because I do not enjoy being at his house- the woman he chose to marry is annoying and my half-brother(son of my step-mom) is also annoying. I don't like it down there, but should I go anyways to see my dad even though he is a jerk? I know fatherly relationships are important but idk...
20090204190346AAkCMLY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he interested at all? ?	So there's this guy in my trignometry class named Ryan and I was wondering if it sounds like he likes me:       Positives:    -he sometimes fixes his hair (like nervous thing guys do)   -looks at me when I walk by and then looks down   -catch him staring at me and then he'll either look for a second or look at the guy next to me or the teacher really quick   -out of the corner of my eye I sometimes see him looking but I don't know if he really is or not   -his friends who I don't know once smiled and stared at me or they get quiet when I'm around   -overtook me in the hallway and it kinda seemed like he wanted me to look at him   -when we passed by and we have to turn, he turns his body in towards me   -he does a headturn when I walk by and then looks down   -today, he let me borrow a pencil but didn't say anything (he just kind of handed it to me.)   -sometimes acts kind of loud in class    -gave me a piece of paper when I asked if I could borrow one from anyone (but I don't know if that's anything)   -let me borrow his calculator but didn't look up when I asked or said thank you..      Negatives:   -he's kind of quiet sometimes but then others he's loud   -he's friends with some frat boys (ugh LoL) and he's semi-popular and talks to girls and stuff and I'm just kind of normal and quiet.    -sometimes it feels like he ignores me   -we were at a vending machine and I bumped into him by accident and said I was sorry, but he just kind of kept quiet. I don't know if that offended him or not. LoL      So does it sound like he's interested or at least like me?

20090204205238AALk67n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice! HELP!!!!?	I'm in head deep with love over this guy! This is the whole story of what happened. I knew this guy from the 2nd grade! I really didn't start liking him till fourth. He was not that cute back then, but I didn't care! I liked him because he was funny! I got his email in the 5th grade and started emailing him. In 6th I started having major feelings for him! I started sending little hint that I liked him. Well in the end it turned out he liked me back! I was sooooooo happy! We hung out and stuff. We hit 7th grade and I felt like I was in heaven! I went to my first dance and a slow song came on. My two wacky friends jumped around the gym dancing. I watched them and laughed. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw his hand. I looked down at it and then up and him. He asked my to dance and I felt like I was flying! Everything was great. He gave me a necklace at the begining of the year and I've worn it since. Times passed. Before school began this year he threw a movie party. That was the best night ever! We all sat on his couch. He sat in the corner, I sat on a long side area, and my friend next to me. The movie went on for a while. Then in the middle of it I heard a ticking noise by my ear. i looked and his and was right on the area above it. After a few minutes he slide it down and put it around me! After a while we got closer and closer till our legs were squished together. IT WAS SO ROMANTIC! I texted him later and he said he wanted to kiss me! Well school started. yay! (roll eyes). My sisters school had a carnival and he was there! We hung out and played. We went up to a feild by her school and we were running around and stuff. I got a hold of his friends shoe. It was fun running from them. I lost my shoe though and he got it. And then I lost the other and he got that one too. Well I had to chase him for a while and finaly we both colapsed by the tennis courts. I asked him what I had to do to get my shoes. Well there was a long silence and I had a feeling he was going to have me kiss him! well I waited and he said a hug. Well i texted him later and he said he was thinking a kiss! I was sooo close! time has dragged on as usual. Thanksgiving break. He told me he liked another girl. I found out from a friend that it was one of my friends and that they both liked each other. I was sooo sad. Time went by. And now I sit thinking about him constantly. He stopped liking me for no reason really. It broke my heart and yet I can't get over it. He was my whole life and now its gone. What should I do? I really want him to like me again. Valentine's day is coming soon and I really hate that its coming soon. Should I get him a valentine's gift? My mind just is rapped around him. I really like him and he's just being weird. I really would like him to like me back. I miss having him talk to me cute and stuff. I'm stuck. HELP!
20090204211856AAHkd8W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you think of this guy?	Lets say you and a guy have never kissed each other before, and then, one night, you almost had a kiss... Except it went a little awkward, and you, the girl, later sort of felt bad for not giving this guy a simple kiss that he wanted.      And so later, you sort of tell him that you're sorry everything was so awkward, and the kiss didn't work out...       And he says, "It's ok... It's not right if you didn't feel ready, anyways.. We've known each other for months, and I've had feelings for you for months without kissing you a single time, so this doesn't really change anything, in terms of how I feel towards you. Don't worry."       Is that a sweet guy or what?

20090204215140AA5CrHD	Family & Relationships;Family	Overbearing Sibling Part 3?	I have posted questions about how to deal with my cold and arrogant sister. Our relationship has deteriorated even further. Recently, we watched an emotional scene between our mom and dad who are both in ill health and are dying.   I reached out to my sister hoping she would take my hand. what happened next was as follows.    Her; Don't touch me.    Me; Why do you have to be like that?   Her; I'll be however  I have to be to get through this.   Me; Then maybe I will too.   Her; Corsair, grow up! This isn't about you!   Me; I thought it was about family.    Her; Alright we'll talk about this.        Later that evening we were running an errand in her car with her at the wheel. She opened with "Ok, can we talk?" I was furious with her so I just said "No" She went on with "Well, I'm going to talk, even if you don't. We can't be having these scenes in front of these people. And if I don't want to be comforted by you, that's just me, OK?"   I didn't say a word, mainly because I was further disgusted by her referring to our parents as "these people" and the continuing superior attitude she presents. Add to that her statement that she does not care to have any emotional contact with me during this difficult time.       I am caring for both our parents full time while she goes on about her life five hundred miles away. Every few weeks she comes to town and regulates how I've been managing their care. She openly and often hostily critisizes how I've been going about things.  Aside from telling her to kiss my #@@, I'm at my wits end on how to deal with the situation.
20090204220312AAWBmlF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Kind of a vent...just tell me what you think?	This might not make any scene to anyone on here. But I was venting. If you have anything to say, please do. Even if it's harsh, i don't mind.      I never really have my “place to fit in” EVER. I thought that leaving everything I ever knew would help, it’s only made me feel more lost than ever.  I like how I have been looking happy and that I look like I’m making progress to be “perfect”. Married, happy, dogs, nice cars, and a big TV, these things all look great, but when I’m sitting here, I realize, I’m not happy. In the 3 years I’ve been married I’ve been alone, actually ALONE for probably 50% of them time. I know when I was in Jersey I always ended up getting into fights with my family, but these days I only want to be around them. I’m still scared of the tension that happens when I live around family, but I’m scared of missing out on living if I stay here. I just hate that now everyone knows how bad it is here, how bad my life is, and how shitty I’ve let my life get. I don’t know if I’ll ever find “my place’ in this world. There is so much to do in life, and I just end up sitting in my little house with no human interaction.  I really wish I could just pick up my life and drop it right in Ocean County. My husband hates where I’m from. The only thing I have in this world, he actually hates. I think there is something wrong with that. God I’m so confused. Maybe I should have waited to settle down. I’ve always been “under the control” of someone. My parents, then my bf in high school, and now Erik. Don’t get me wrong I had loved them all. Well still do. But I need my space to find myself. Is that so wrong? I’m 21 and have never really been able to just do what I want without pissing off the one I love. I just need to do me for a little bit. At the same time I feel like if I was alone I would be a failure. But most 21 year olds don’t have much. I live the life of a 40 year old woman. All I can say is that I’m SO happy I have decided to not have a baby yet. I just want to start going to school and live somewhere that I can call up an old friend and have lunch with them. I don’t care to have anything super fancy. I’ve found my way to smile and it’s NOT living here.  I actually hate living these days.  Even when I lived in Pensacola, most of the time I just sat there all day, it’s so depressing, and I’m really such a happy person! I hate wasting my life; I know there is so much more to life. I’m grateful for getting to come to Washington.  This place is really pretty. Like national geographic pretty. But I’m just ready to be happy, I know how to become happy, but I’m scared.

20090204182303AAPc3Iw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Anyone with relationship experience, women would be nice.Thanks?	She doesn't love me, but i know she likes me ,we have been friends for a year. she had a 2 year old son, she is 21 i am 22. I have been in falling in love with her and her son and decided i want to be a bigger part of their lives. We went out, it was a good date, and we kissed at the end of the night. She told me a week later that she didn't feel a "spark" and that i was all these great things and a nice guy etc. I still love them both though, i never told her because i wanted her to love me back, and i didn't want to lose her or her son because i chose to share my feelings at the wrong time. She calls me and texts me alot and really wants to maintain a friendship, but i am crushed. I am miserable and do my best to hide that from her, the though of someone else with her ruins my day, and i can't bare it. I don't know what to do , i think she may be afraid of dating, and that's why she told me what she did, but i am not sure. We are getting together this weekend and i am not sure what to do. I need to make some progress, and i am not sure if telling her what i feel is a good idea.     Sidenote: I"ve been letting HER contact me first the past 2 weeks to try to make her want me more i've been less available and very calm and cool. Not sure if his is what i am supposed to do, but i'll try anything, but i don't want to be a bad guy, i'd rather she always thinks of me as the nice guy who is always there for her.

I am a sophomore in high school and I really like this girl in my Orchestra class who's in 7th grade, and I think that she might like me as well.  She is the most beautiful girl I have seen and has a great personality, along with a very high level of maturity.  She also seems to like me, but I am not 100% sure about that, though she does tend to stare at me in class and, when she can, get closer to me, to within a couple of inches.   Also, I am not the stereotypical high school sophomore, I don't want "just sex" in a relationship, only someone that I can feel extremely attached to that also returns the feelings, someone who I can hold, etc. without them feeling uncomfortable.

20090204203445AAWvcJy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Child support issues...?	So my ex and I are having issues. I moved out three weeks ago with our 13 month old son. He watches our son everyday between 1 and 6, while I work. I then pick him up and go home. As of today, he has not given me any money. My family and friends say he should, and I agree. But he makes me feel guilty for asking him for money. He thinks I'm being vindictive and bitter for him dumping me. I have not gone through the courts, I have been wanting to avoid that. I feel he's leaving me no choice. He says he has no money, he's broke, he can barely buy groceries for himself. I feel badly for him on one hand, on the other, he has a child he has to help provide for. Am I being ridiculous? from experience, is there a way to solve these issues without involving the legal system. Also, I've been offered full time work, and I cannot afford to pay for child care myself, but I can't depend on him for money, as he has shown. Just some advice,  words of wisdom would be great. Thank you
20090204203432AASSsGm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think my husband could be sex addiction?	He lost his first wife because he would watch porn alot. But then again they never had sex because she didn't like it. But now he is married to me and last year I found out he was watching porn on the internet. No big deal right? Wrong. It got to the point that he would have to watch it before having sex with me. We talked about and he said he won't do it as much. He was good for awhile but now he is doing it again. I told him before that I didn't care but he is keeping it a secret again. I ask him if I could watch with him and of course he said no. I have done every thing my husband has asked me to do in the bedroom. I do mean everything. Like spanking, gagging, stuff like that cause he really likes it. I have even ask if he would like another woman in the bedroom. I don't understand why he hides it from me? I also don't understand why he gets upset with me after watching it.He treats me like **** later on in the day and I don't understand why? I am not mad at the fact that he watches but the fact he lies to me about it. I do know that he cheated on his first wife. I am scared that he will soon do that to me. So my question is do you think he has an addiction to sex? and why does he get upset with me after he watches it. I don't say anything to him so why be upset with me? I am really confused and really don't understand what I am doing wrong? I am getting to the point where I am about to leave!!!! Like I said I don't mind that he watches just that he treats me like crap for the rest of the day after he does! and the fact he keeps it a secret? What would you do or think? Thanks for the help.

20090204210457AAaES7q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So, There Is This Girl That I Like?	Yeah, so there is this girl, and basically, I like her. A lot... Anyway, so we've been friends for quite some time now, and recently, a mutual friend told me that the girl also liked me. We hang out during school, but we've only really hung out, outside of school once.   I know Valentine's Day is upcoming, and so I was thinking of asking her out for this weekend, instead of waiting it out and leaving us both single for the big VDay.      Also, I know her Birthday is near the end of the month, but I FORGOT which day, and the only way I can find out is to ask her or a friend, but if she finds out I forgot, I'm going to feel like a jerk. (I tend to feel guilty for things like this.)      Does anyone have any ideas as to what I should do for the two above?

20090204215443AAGOtaI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	If he said he doesn't think he can be my boyfriend because he is super busy, is he dumping me?	We are now having a very difficult period. We had a cold war for a week and he broke the ice last week. He said he likes me and not ending things. But now he dodges all my calls and only answered my texts selectively. I suspected that he was mad at me because i didnt put out the last time we made out (because he knew how i lost my virginity to a player just a few months ago and may feel that his ego is hurt when i didnt put out. Do you think its the reason? ).       I know hes not lying about the super busy part because i know what duties he has at school. But I told him I am not a needy girlfriend that needs to be with him 24/7. I sometimes believe in platonic love. As long as we can hear each other's voice every morning or night, know how each other's doing, I don't mind if my boyfriend can't have meals with me. But now, I think I am worse than a passerby to him.       I know that him dodging calls is a big red flag. And we technically only dated for 2 days before we had the cold war, though we had been through a lot already before dating.

20090204223618AA8Z0N4	Family & Relationships;Family	How can i solve this brother/sister situation?	my 7 year old cousin was over today. her parents went to see my uncles dad, so my mom, sisters, and brother babysat her. Well it was awkward cause my cousin is about 4'9" and my 16 year old brother is only 4'8". we were just playing dress up cause she loves wearing my clothes as a joke. so she wore one of my old dresses with one of my 2in. heels so now she was even taller like 5' and now clearly taller than my brother. with her being only 7 and still too young to understand how my brother feels about being so short, she really let him have it. the whole time while she wore the heels she acted like she was my brothers mommy (she has a 4 year old brohter and she thinks shes his mommy, so i guess anyone smaller than her she thinks shes the older one.) i felt bad for my brother so i tried telling her to leave him alone and stay by me and my sisters. she did until her mom came to pick her up. when my aunt walked in she couldnt believe how much taller her daughter was than my brother. her and my mom made them stand next to each other barefoot and saw that she had a couple inches on him. then when they were about to leave, my aunt wanted a picture of all of us kids. with my cousin still wearing the dress and heels she was alot taller than my brother. so my mom and aunt made us stand like in a line going from tallest to shortest so we could see all of our heads. i was in the back, twin sisters were in front of me, then our cousin, and finally our little but older brother. they took about 4 pictures each. when they left my brother got real mad at my mom and me. i didnt know what i did until he said i had to let her wear my heels. he was mad at my mom for making him stand next to our cousin knowing he was shorter and 9 years older. i feel really bad and didn't think he'd take it this hard. he hasn't come out of his room since even with my mom and me apologizing already. What should i do?
20090204221206AAfIEe5	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I in The Wrong? And do I deserve continuous harassment?	i was 'friends' with a girl for years. we had alot of ups and downs throughout the time of our friendship.    One night years ago .. out drinking at a party .. she was there with her bf at the time ,,, and she introduced me to his friend , who i ended up spending a drunken night with. Well within a week she and her bf had broken up and she went on to start dating the 'friend' in which i hooked up with.  They dated for a few years and had a kid together. I got to know him while they were together, and we became friends -NOTHING MORE.   They eventually broke up , and i continued to stay friends with both of them. In time - it was inevitable and bound to happen - she and i stopped being friends. She moved on to date other men and eventually became seriously involved with another man, living with him and everything.    I still hung out with her ex and his family, they were always good to me  - unlike her (too much too get into) - and i ended up hooking up with him (the ex) for a short amount of time - and yes that means i did sleep with him. Nothing serious came of it, but we still remain friends.      The sex happened 2 years ago   I started talking to my ex friend again about 6 months ago .... and she asked me if i ever slept with her ex ... i told her the truth. and now i endure nothing but harassment and threats from her and her friends.      i look at it this way - if we want to get technical   - i had him 1st   - she and i were no longer friends when it happened   - it was a year and a half after they broke up - and by this time she already had a live in bf - and a few bfs before that   - and finally, i dont see how this affected her in reality in anyway at all- besides maybe the thoughts she has about it that obviously drives her nutz      Now she has threatened to 'punch me out' knwing im not a fighter    her and her friends constantly bring it up and harass me and tell me im going to pay, and ive 'messed with the wrong ppl'      Okay i can understand shes mad but its the past - it affected her in no way ... and im sick of the harassment      Is it really that bad that i deserve to be hated in her words 'til death'?  and constantly harassed and threatened?  and if i dont deserve this - as i dont beleive i do - what can i do to make it stop?

20090204223119AA3UwbL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask a girl out?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i've fallen in love with my friend. I fell in love with her the second i saw her 3 years ago. She is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she's really smart. Whenever I see her I get weak at the knees & get butterflies in my stomach. She takes my breath away and whenever i see her i feel like i have to use all my strength to keep myself from kissing her. I lose all rational thought when I see her. We're in math class together and i can't keep my eyes off of her. Seeing her is the best part of my day. I've tried to ask her out but i freeze up every time. I've tried to ask her out everyday for the last 3 years. I've even tried doing it over the phone but I just freeze up when I try to ask her. I'm trying so hard to ask her but I just can't do it and its driving me crazy. She would be the perfect girlfriend/wife. I love everything about her & when ever i see her i always get lost in her eyes. I just cant resist that look in her eyes. and it so cute when she plays with her hair. I think she might like me but i'm not sure she keeps telling me that i'm really smart and she tells all of her friends and her parents that too. and sometimes she teases me and she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. and we've been studying together every week for math. and she said that she likes how i'm always there for her. I really want to be with her. I would b a good bf. I would adore her and shower her with kisses all the time. Her kiss has to be like heaven. I've fallen in love with her and I want to marry her. My life would be perfect if i had her. Meeting her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I think about her day & night and i keep daydreaming about her in class. not being able to ask her out is driving me crazy. And whats even worse is that she is going out of state for college. I know I have to ask her but I can't get the words to come out. Not knowing if she wants me is unbearable but I can't get myself to just ask her. I just can't stop thinking about her. I know that she is my true love and soul mate I just know it. I have to have her. I wish she knew how much I love her. It's just so hard to ask her out and I need to know how. How do you ask a girl out?

I am 18, a recent high school graduate..and took a year off before going to college...although I may not go back for a little while.    I've always wanted to travel..especially to Greece/Paris/London/Africa/Ireland.    I want to go EVERYWHERE!    I still live with my parents, obviously...  and we are moving to Wilmington, North Carolina in a couple of months.    When I get down there I am obviously going to get some kind of job, and start saving money.    I don't know whether I should save money to travel, or to get an apartment.    I know it's important to be out on my own, and blah blah blah    but a part of me thinks that I should travel while I have the chance, and still live at home..and do not have to worry about rent..etc.      What do you think?!      Backpack Europe...and a few other places.  or get an apartment.

20090204224904AAXyP67	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My mom is dating someone in my grade?	I am 17 and a senior in high school and recently I have discovered that my mom is dating someone in my grade. My boyfriend and I came home on the weekend from a movie we went too and we discovered them making out on the couch and she eventually confessed that she has been seeing him behind my back for 6 months (I have no idea how they even met). He is 18 and she is 45 and he is a senior at my HS too. Some of my friends are friends with him and I have talked to him at some parties and he is a total loser - he has terrible grades, is always getting in trouble and its just disgusting. I have not talked to her since I found out and I don't even know if I want to. What do I do, I am so hurt and shocked and never even want to speak to her again (of course I will). At the moment I'm pretty sure that after I graduate and go to college I don't want any contact with her (she has always done crazy stuff like this). I talked to this guy at lunch today (I was trying to find out why on earth he would want to date my mother) and he said that I would make a wonderful step-daughter, ugh!  What should I do?

20090205003359AAt60S7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you love someone you haven't actually met?	Well i have known him for lets see i don't know how long but a long time now.    I started off txting him getting, i got his number off my sister.   We started txting each other a lot and got to know each other well.   Some way or another after txting him for awhile i became very close too him, We would tell each other nearly all our secrets, tell each other what was happening in our lives, give each other advice, and then if one of us started this thing were we would call each other things like young lad, or young lady, and use words sorta back in those days, but it's a thing that just we would do, somehow one of us started it and the other one just knew what we were doing with out saying, whatt? like you know you could just connect in that way.    And instead of crying myself to  sleep at night he would make me smile and feel sooo happy and NO matter what mood i was in he could always make me happy.   But then after awhile we kinda stopped txting each other slowly but somehow we did.   But then my life felt so lonely like i was missing something in it, my heart felt empty.   I know what hes like i have seen lot's of pictures of him heard about him a lot [from my sister cause she has met him]    I have even talked to him on the phone.   Anyway a lot of time has passed and things have happened.   My sister is now going out with him, except he moved and so did we so i guess there kinda in a long distant relationship, anyway that's not the point i recently started txting him again and have got very close with him again, i know we can't be together because he has my sister, but that's fine with me.    But i have really strong feelings for him even just thinking about him can make my heart skip a beat, and some night i can't get to sleep for ages cause i lay in bed thinking of him.   Anyway can you fall in love with someone even if you haven't met them, but you know nearly everything about them, and have these feelings that are very strong.      Btw i am gonna meet him one day i am, maybe this year even!      So can you fall in actual love even if you haven't met them?   And when you do meet them you still have those feelings and maybe they will be stronger or maybe they might be gorn.      Well yeah.      Cheers, Em.

20090205002028AA1DnoU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I A Scumbag, Am I Going to Hell?	Girl works for me for three summers. I was 19 and she was 14 when we met. She hit on me mercilessly, I really liked her and apparently she really liked me. She always lit up when she worked with me, always wanted to touch me hug me etc. She told me she loved me a few times. I have never been in love before but for some reason she felt like "the one," and I think she maybe had the same feeling about me. I never let her know I liked her cause I was to old for her and she worked for my family.      I thought I broke her heart in December after the last summer we worked together when she was 17 and I was 22. I wrote a letter apologizing to her, spelling everything out, I honestly felt bad. I guess she had no idea I even liked her. She got pissed at me. I think she was getting dumped form her BF at the time. Told me to never talk to her again, I haven't.      I told one co worker who knew about this incident, as well as my parents who own the store I wrote the letter cause I wanted her to stop touching/flirting with me. My parents always told me she had a huge crush on me.      The girl never worked for me again the two summers after. The first summer she came in twice stared at me, and I ignored her. She found my mom a few days later and talked to her.      This past summer, she came in trying to talk to me, I ignored her. She then came in a lot the rest of the summer. She would never talk to me, but came in so often other employees got suspicious. I got a ton of hang up phone calls. I also was told by many of my employees a girl was calling the store wondering when I was working, she wouldn't leave a name, a number or a message for me.

20090204235747AAguH0l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help with talking "dirty" to my boyfriend?	I know this sounds insanely silly, but I really don't even have the slightest idea as to how to talk dirty to my boyfriend. The other day he said he wanted me to talk dirty to him and I honestly have no idea what to say! I'm really comfortable with him and we've been together about a year, so it's not like I'm just being shy. I'm 24 and really sexually inexperienced, so I have no clue how to do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

20090205015336AAjfMVG	Family & Relationships;Weddings	If your boyfriend were to propose, would you prefer it to be a public or private affair?	.. public meaning in front of friends and relatives during a very important dinner, and everyone cheering you on, "YES!! Say YESss!!" etc      ...or do you prefer it to just be in a private setting, with just you and him present? Less pressure, but I guess less grand as well !       Personally, I don't understand why some men think it romantic and special to propose to his honey in public - amidst family, work associates, even in the train !!! What if she feels pressured to say "yes" just to save him face in front of everyone, for instance?       Worse, what if she says "NO!!!"?

20090204231013AAlD97a	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it possible??? or am im gonna ruin a relationship with my mom for nothing!!?	well lets see this may be a long one. i am 21 years old. i have a 14 year old brother who still lives with our mom in ohio. (im in tn). our mother is not a good mother at all. i will give you some examples of what she did to me when i was younger: lets see at the age of 15 i held a belt around my moms arm so she could shoot up god knows what. when i was around 16 she cut her wrist wiped her blood on me and said it was my fault. when i was 13 she let me and my friends smoke cigarettes. at 15 she let us smoke weed and drink alcohol. and at 17 we were smoking crack together(i've been clean for 2 years now) she has been in and out of jail/prison she has a few domestic violence's a few dui's and her most recent one from last year trafficking crack/cocaine. now out of all these charges my little brother has not been taken out of her home. i have a clean record me and my husband own our house. shes on "disability". me and my husband both work. now for the question!      do u think i can get custody of him? if so how would i go about doing this? i don't think i can afford an attorney! also ive asked my mother if he could move down here. and her answers always no!  my brother wants to live down here!!!!!!! HELP!!!!!!!      also she is an alcoholic. and lets my 14yr old brother smoke and drink. its killing me the way hes growing up. hes cussing and shes already called the cops on him for domestic violence. she oushed him so he pushed her and she called the co[s. hes failing all his classes too!!!

20090205004852AA3CxaY	Family & Relationships;Family	Choosing a friend over family?	Well my sister and her fiance broke up after two kids and two years of engagement. Me and my family really dont get along and when he moved in with us things got alot better we just clicked. he was always there for me and was closer to me than my own family and sad to say but i was closer with him than my sister was. he was like my brother. so when he left eventually he stopped having any contact whatsoever with us not even to check up on his kids. well my sis and my mom kept making him out to be a horrible person like a monster and to me it just didnt add up i knew him and this wasnt him so i secretly met up with him to straight up ask him what was going on and why he dint want anything to with us he told me that the someone from the court advised him not to have any contact with us because we can use any little thin against him in court to try to win over custody which is exactly what my family was doing too. he said he does love his kids to death and that he missed me too. he started crying because he thought that i hated him. so basically it was a misunderstanding and my sister kind of overreacted because she wrote out her reasons for full custody and used his past of a bad childhood to say that he was mentally ill and that he needed help and she wrote some things that only she knew about him and that were very personal so he is very upset and hurt. he is very close to me and knows me better than anyone else does even now he has been there for me through depression and losing a loved one, i have always considered him as family and that is exactly what he is to me he is my brother. So now i feel like im choosing him over my family and im not trying to its just like i can have both and i dont know what to do. they say friends come and go but family is forever but its like i have two families so how does that rule apply to me i just needsomeone to give me some advice on what to do.

20090205011435AAecJIy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why did my ex do this for me?	For my 21st birthday i invited my ex to a party i had at my cousins house, we've been broken up for more than 2 years and he has a gf. He brought his gf with him to my birthday but later dropped her off and came back. Prior to this, we just barely starting talking again after being broken up. I got drunk and the whole night i was really really mean to him. I told him "i dont even like you" "your not a friend" "go away!" i kept asking "what are you doing here". Basically I was MEAN, but yet he stayed and took care of me even though i had other people already taking care of me. He cleaned up after the party, he made sure i drank water, took me out to get some air, he held me in an intimate way as others described and helped me walk and basically took the initiative to take care of me. He even came to my house after to take care of me still until i unknowingly kicked him out because i started crying and told him that he hurt me. Why did he do this? He really could have just left. How much can an ex still care for you and just because he cares does that mean there's feelings involved to? That night/morning he kept texting my friend who was also watching me to make sure i was ok over and over again. He even went as far as asking my friend at 4am if they wanted him to buy some medicine for me and come back.      I apologized to him in the morning and thanked him and he was asking how i was doing and advising me what to do to feel better.   2 days later he IMed me and told me everything that happened and i apologized more for everything and he kept saying that i shouldnt be sorry. And then he said that I put a smile on his face that day. He admitted that he was scared to come because he was afraid my cousins would hurt him, but regardless he still came through.      he now keeps in contact with me more than before.      thanks in advance

I know were not like great friends and I wish I could have got to know you more, but I just wanted to let you know that ever since the first time I saw you, you've been the girl I thought about each day.

It just like bothers me when I keep things in like that and I just wanted to let you know. Well good luck in college, I hope your happy and just know you deserve the best. Take care"      *also, the girl and guy arn't like strangers. they're friends, just not like great friends.

20090205010739AA94xiN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you miss someone and not be attached to him?	I'm a single, happy, independent girl in her 20's. I'm not one to do one night stands or be in relationship after relationship. I'd rather wait for the "right one" or whoever I feel is "worth it" than date alot of random people.     I was "talking" to this guy for a lil over a month and got to know him well. We clicked and got along right away. A month is so short but b/c of our personalities, our "best behavior" attitudes went away within a week and got to be ourselves right away. (very honest and deep for someone u just met...he wasn't so much "on the surface" but confided in me things he didn't tell his guys). We are both very blunt people who will have healthy disagreements but ultimately get along and still have a sweet feeling in mouth (rather than biter). I feel like I met my "match" (not so much w. the soulmate connotation but someone on my level intellectually and seriously, he's a guy version of me).    He's been very HONEST w. me fr. the getgo (and i REALLY appreciate it, no matter how ugly it may be sometimes). We both don't want anything serious now. I'm not where i want to be in life right now (i wanna get my degree and get a job and that's when i feel i'm ready for a relationship IF if comes) and he just got out of a LONG term and while all his friends are taken or married, he's the only one who's got it all BUT a girl. He told me he was over his ex but it's the experience that drained him - which I understand COMPLETELY.    We're friends now and I'm very happy. We still talk and keep in good communication. He still innoncently flirts and is playful at times but we keep things in check. I miss the guy...it's not a "romantic" kind of missing but honestly, afer getting to know someone...you just miss their company. I admit I was crushing on him but it didn't get too serious where I wake up crying or needing strength. (I cared about my best friend whom I fell in love w. in whom i was PSYCHO over...that was attached)    I'm not attached...i miss the person...that's possible, right?
20090204233356AAN5VRP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend calls me "daddy"...is it weird? Please see details?	My wonderful girlfriend (a good chance she will be my future wife, too) likes to call me "daddy". First, let me start by saying that it doesn't bother me. It's not just a sexual playful name like most people would probably assume.      I think there is a deeper significance to it. You see, her parents were killed in a car accident a few years ago, and since then she hasn't had anyone to protect her and take care of her. She has had to 'fend for herself. She says that I provide her with safety and security.      In an unusual way, I actually love the way it makes me feel, to have her call me daddy. I am NOT the controlling type...I'm actually the complete opposite. So don't think it's because I have control issues. Our relationship is completely equal and there is so much mutual respect. No one controls the other.      But I think it's because I have seen how much pain she has gone through in life, I just want to reach out and hold her so close and protect her, because she doesn't have that kind of person in her life anymore. I love calling her my "baby girl". I love making her feel safe, almost like a parent would for a child.      So what do you think? Is this sweet and caring or is it somewhat weird that she and I feel this way for each other? We love each other very much.

How long do your first dates last with blind dates/people from the Internet?  I like mine to only last about 1-2 hours because it is too nerve racking for the dates to last longer. Do you think this is too short? I feel too pressured on a first date, even if the date is going well. What reason do you usually give as to why you have to end the date? What is your ideal first date with someone you don't know, i.e., someone on the Internet? Coffee or drinks at a bar? Thx.
20090205005732AAJLiE7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it inappropriate to confide in your married male friends about your dating life?	I find it may be inappropriate, even if the conversation is innocent, because this info is too private to share with your married male friends.  Of course I wouldn't talk about sex with my married male friends.  Do you think it is inappropriate to talk about your dating life with your married male friends if you're single?  Only if you're close with your married male friends should you disclose this info?  I sometimes talk about my dating experiences with my male friends, but not my married male friends.  Do you agree with this?  Thx.

20090205000637AAZzWFB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends pulled prank on me?	the other day my friend and acquaintance really annoyed me. sure we were messing around and stuff at first, and i was acting immature and annoying. my friend got angry at me and told me to stop so i apologized. but then they sent me around 100 text messages to annoy me, since i have to pay whenever i send a text and they have a phone plan where its free for them. my friend sent probaly about 100 and the acquaintance about 30 or so. i repeatedly told them to stop and they didnt, thinking it was funny. i finally snapped, grabbed the acquaintance (i would have grabbed whoever sent the last text at the moment i snapped) and knocked him off the chair he was sitting in, and he finally stopped. my friend also finally stopped.      but the problem is, they still havent paid me back for the ridiculous amount of necesasry texts they sent me which, totals about 10$ for me friend and $5 for the acquaintance. hell, they havent even apologized yet      i'm a little guy so theyre both quite a bit bigger than me, so it wasnt easy for me to confront them last time. thats why i waited too long to take action      we're all in our 20's      should i demand that they pay back the $15 and do whatever it takes to get it back, or just let it go?
20090204234905AA1pHiA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have u regret marrying wrong guy after she became old?	You were very shallow, and married most attractive men or women, and when she became over 50, she got unattractive, and you dont like her anymore. she was a girl who have nice body, and cute face, but no good personality. You lather should have married girl with great personality.
20090204234255AAzV1xL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should we have sex on Valentine's Day?	Me and my boyfriend have been dating 2 years and have never had sex. We was thinking about having sex on Valentines Day. We are both nervous about it. We both wanted to wait until we get married to each other. So should we have sex or just wait?
20090205003319AAkA3UA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did my bf insult me or am I being too sensitive/insecure?	Basically my bf when we are together has said a lot of things that offended me, about my looks and body appearance.  He would also be looking at other girls and one time he said to me "that girl's voice is sexy" after he heard her talking.  One time I told him that someone once said I look like Rihanna and he just laughed and said "please".  and just from the way he talks I know my body isn't anywhere close to his ideal female body type.  It sucks that he basically openly lets me know this too.    I'll admit it I'm insecure about my looks, do you think I'm overreacting by being upset at his behavior?  Ladies how would u feel about this?  Should I just move on?  He says things like this that really cut me deeply but sometimes he makes me feel great.  Sometimes he is a kind person and makes my problems melt away when I'm with him tho.    P.S. I'm trying to be more accepting of who I am and loving myself

20090205002656AAx2Eir	Family & Relationships;Friends	I've never considered myself a jealous person, but?	I can't help but feel a little envious of my best friend from primary school. When we younger she had everything, but we were the best of friends so it didn't bother me. She lived in an amazing house, had great parents and siblings and just had a good life.      Now her life is probably even better. I have her on facebook and shes freaking gorgeous, has been in a relationship for ages, has a great group of friends, still lives in a beautiful house, has the same great parents and goes to a really good school.      I'm a little envious partly because my life has just crumbled to pieces. When we were friends when we were a bit younger I was going through a really rough time with family stuff and I never told her any of it. In the 4/5 years since then her life has just gotten better and mine has gotten worse.      I'm good at feeling sorry for myself, and I know that the universe doesn't have emotions but sometimes I feel like its against me.      Or maybe I'm just against myself.
20090204235739AAqTbNU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why there are so many attractive girls, but no good personality?	Everytime I found the good looking girls, they just have nice meat and cute face, but once I got to know them they are so cruel.  I havent done anything to them, they just prejudice me, they are always in the bad mood, & say cruel things about people. They have jurk boyfriends, I cant tell men they just want to taste their body.

20090205004910AAM419s	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think i lost my best friend, any advice?	hello, i have made a decision i regret. ill explain this as simply as possible. me and my best friend liked the same girl in highschool and we all started hanging out pretty much because of that. she ended up dating him, to be honest, i could have gotten her but i decided to let him have her cause he was OBSESSED. they were eachothers first everythings, first bf, first sexual partner etc... all three of us hung out nearly all day, everyday. my feelings for her never really went away though. i was going through girls like crazy but it felt like it was cause i was always comparing them to her. their relationship was suffering entering its 2nd year after we both became wrapped up in our girlfriends. she would often complain to me and tell me she didnt want to be with him and i was stuck feeling confused and trying to stay out of it. eventually after another 2 years she got the courage to break up with him and went out with this guy from new york she met online. i was mad at her, but eventually i forgave her, but he never did. her and i hung out alone after that and it was weird but the chemistry was thick. i had a girlfriend at the time tho so i kept my distance. me and my bestfriend were also getting really close at the sametime. my girl ended up leaving me for some dude in florida off line and i was pretty messed up after 3 and a half years. then a few months later my friends ex broke up with her bf from NY and things between us started to get more apparent. i fought off the feelings for a while, about 6 months and the other day i finally admitted to my bestfriend that i do have feelings for her. they have been broken up over a year now so i didnt think it would be that bad but i was wrong. he isnt talking to me at all and he wont even let me try and explain any further. he said he feels like i picked her over him which is not true. i told him if it meant our friendship i would tell her that we couldnt be but hes just ignoring me. i really like her though and her and i have been through more than he realizes. she feels like were dating cause i told him and is all giddy but i feel like complete s***. i feel like i let him have his shot at her, and he treated her like s***, and now hes angry that i have a shot. what can i do to feel better about all of this mess???
20090205004354AAd4iUA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do men laugh at how much women worry and show concern for their welfare?	My BF was laughing because i was really worried about him going out in his lorry to work in tis awful snow.. I panic incase he has an accident and he laughs how he's great at his job etc and knows what he's doing, Makes me feel stupid, But its normal to worry about the ones you love right?   Does it annoy men when a woman shows weakness or concern? :(
20090204234126AAc4S8o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, do you think I would be a good boyfriend?	I'm 18 and all my life I've been a virgin.

I go to college and plan on being Teacher. I don't have a lot of friends, I'm actually a loner but I'm always open for new people in my life to inspire me. Um, I'm really sensitive about my feelings and I would love to share my life and my heart with someone really special. I accept and respect people for their opinions and beliefs.

If your brother and your husband have a fight ?   if your brother and your husband have a fight and angrily he killed your husband and later on he regretted it and feel he shouldn't kill him and no one has the clue who killed your husband including police and they could never know who did the murder then would you give your brother to police or will u forgive your brother   if you give him in prison he will stay there for 15 year or even hanged him   and more importantly will u forgive your brother if he beg you for it
20090204231130AAeApLv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How does it make you feel when?	You think you found a friend on Y/A, you shared a similar sense of humor and had good conversation. You live hundreds of miles apart and in your mind it is purely platonic. Then you find out the guy is probably some player. It has really hurt my feelings because this friendship came at a time when I really needed some laughter in my life. Why are so many men perverts?

20090205003729AAH8pzS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you react after your BF tells you this?	I had a very bad dream that involved my ex, I woke up very upset and texted my bf to tell him about it. He knows that my ex was abusive and that I moved here to be away from him. Anyway I told my bf about my dream which involved my ex finding me. He texted back "Oh s**t I hope is not a sign...that makes me have second thoughts about staying over"    I think that he was been selfish and just thinking about himself. FYI my ex was abusive with me and our sons but it was emotional and psychological, I will never put anybody in danger if I knew that my ex would hurt somebody because of me.    Guys, how would you have reacted if it were you?   Girls, how would you feel if you were in my place?
20090205012729AALulFv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do we fall in love?	I was just wondering why we are intensely attracted to some people and not others. And why do we 'fall in love' with them? What is love exactly? Some animals pick different mates each year, and never stay with them for long. Female spiders eat their mates :S So why do we develop relationships and deep feelings towards people?      And what is it about that one certain person that drives you crazy?      I'm just curious :)

20090204231058AA96kha	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm really worried that we aren't going to make it. Moneys tight...?	My family is going through big money problems. It's just me, my mom, my dad and my older sister living with us (I'm 17). The only income that we have been living off is my dad's 700some dollar pay check. My mom lost her job in the summer and I am a part time Nanny living off of 15 dollars a day. My dad's hours just got cut to 40 hours a week so I am even more afraid. We've already been having troubles buying groceries and paying bills... My phone's been shut off (just got it turned on today thanks to my brother) every things just been crazy. Rent is 700 dollars a month and were not even making that much a week anymore. My sister and Mom have been applying everywhere for jobs. My mom worked at a department store for 15 years and was fired all because she asked them to hold a check. And my sister has little experience in anything. They tried for jobs everywhere. Nobody is hiring. I just am going out of my mind. Please give me suggestions of places my mom can apply for. We have no where we can go if we get evicted...      My mom is interested in working in cleaning but she has no prior experience. As with nanny jobs. Please list some websites. I would be really grateful. Times are tough for lots of people in the country right now.      BTW they already applied at just about every fast food place, grocery store, department store, pet store, gas station, everywhere!
20090204235206AAUN3Jv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Okay Im laying it out on the line I need answers...preferably men....?	-I went on one date with a guy from online   -the whole time he told me how hot I was and how he was so shocked   he called me two days later to see how I was doing, but never asked me out again   -he now talks to me a lot on AIM   -I asked him what this was because I will not be a girl to be used for booty   -He said he would like to hang out but he does not want it to be a date right now   -He said he likes to wake up, go to school, work out, come home make dinner, and go to bed. And that he likes doing his own thing right now.   -We still haven't hung out but he still keeps talking to me even after I told him once I wasn't going to anymore.   -He is a grad student in pharmacy with 18 credits.   Do I continue waiting for this guy because he still keeps talking to me and obviously doesn't want to lose contact or do I say buh-bye?
20090204234747AARx54j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I wait for him..until he is ready?	I really like this guy and he thinks im cute and we sometimes flirt. He is totally nice, but the only thing is when i try and get close to him (emotionally) he puts his guard up. All his friends think we should be together but he has not said much on the subject,his friend said he is interested in me. But  he had bad luck in relationships, all of his girlfriends in the past either broke up with him to date their ex BF or cheated on him. And the only girl that he loved was a foreign exchange student that he hoped would get citizenship to stay in the U.S. but could not and ended going back to her country. So my question is should I just keep talking/hanging out with him and try to build his trust and show him im not like his ex's and i could be good girlfriend material or should i just move on. Should i tell him that I really like him?    He gives me butterflies in my stomach every time I see him and he makes my heart beat fast. How long is to long to wait for a person.

20090205011403AA5pzuf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls do you do this too?	I seem to have noticed that whenever i stand i tend to bend my one leg a bit and keep the other straight, i mean i dont really stand like with both of my legs straight as it doesnt feel comfortable to me. Do all girls stand like that?      I wonder if i learnt this behavior somewhere or is it just me? because    it kinda looks like you are trying to be hot or like posing for something, but its very natural to me.      is it ok to do that.
20090205005102AAzSSX3	Family & Relationships;Family	Did i do the right thing? She came to talk to me.?	i had decided to quit talking or maintaining contact relationship with this cousin of mine because a lot of reasons. Here are a few of them:   1. She always used to tell me what people say behind my back, eve though it made no sense and it would hurt me a lot because i lost my mom when i was 9 and people talking crap about me really upset me, but she continued telling me that, maybe to make me feel bad.      2. She was only interested in phone friendship and we would hardly ever meet like not even for 1 hour in 2 years.      3. She just seemed like the kind of person who likes talking bad about people to make herself feel good.      She came to talk to me today as i have not been taking her calls or anything, and she was like why dont you take my calls, what happened, I just told her i am not interested in talking to her anymore and gave her the reasons.      I would like to know, was i right to do this?

20090204232417AAoFvPI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I so stupid that I can't talk to women like a normal person?	Or anyone for that matter really- I get tense, shakes, blush (especially with women). Everything I think of in terms of small talk sounds so contrived and stupid. They say women like honesty, so to me that means "hi I don't know you at all but I think youre stunning and I am not good with chitchat so can I just stare at you for a while and expect to sleep with you at some point? I'll buy you some food if you want or whatever, it's fine if we go do some arbitrary things if you want, like a movie or whatever, but really I'm just imagining what you look like naked, and my apartment is a mess and my weekly income isn't much more than a pittance, but you can come over and watch me work on guitar at home, because that's really all I do other than work, and I'm not a great conversationalist, except for brutal honesty that freaks most people out if I let it out"  It feels like I'm stuck in the Seinfeld where George says "hi I'm unemployed and live with my mother" and he scores with the bombshell... but we all know that doesn't happen.  So typically I bottle it up and scare women off, all ppl really.  Anything else just seems so contrived. I asked a girl at starbucks about a book she was reading but really I couldn't care less. Am I shallow? Or just too honest? I'm 38 and I've always freaked girls out, I feel like an idiot teenager (no offense teens).  I still don't know how to date because I don't play mind games. People don't really like honesty, they want finesse and innuendo. Well I ain't got it. Starbucks girl left, and I hope, but I imagine I'll never see her  again in spite of trying like hell to play the bullshlt game. She seemed to enjoy my company, but it really wasn't the real 'me'. It's exhausting to talk normally in terms of the suave garbage I see other people doing. On top of that I'm epileptic and can't drive a car (in a basically car-mandatory city) and I am still dealing with that recent diagnosis. "Hi, would you like to walk everywhere with me and converse in a blunt manner, or not at all because I'm excessively withdrawn, and just hang out?" ya that probably won't work.  Ya I talk myself down, but really... Seinfeld is fiction.

20090205004605AAuqIWC	Family & Relationships;Family	My sister-in-laws son abuses my daughter?	He is 4 &1/2 and my daughter is 6. Ever since I can remember he was violent. But he is especially violent with my DD since she doesn't hit back. Me & my husband TRIED to be calm and hoped it was just a phase, but its gotten much worse. SIL just sits there on her immensely large *** and says NOTHING other than the occasional (when someone is watching) "that's not nice, say your sorry" And he wont even acknowledge her and does it again. He bites, spits, chokes, punches and emotionally hurts my daughter and one time my SIL actually said to my DH (and by the way, I was not present) "payback is a *****" For what I do not know! My daughter NEVER laid a finger on her son! Nor did my DH ever hit her as children! She is such a jealous nasty witch and always has been. I think shes seriously jealous because our kids are gorgeous, and hers look like Benjamin Button! I/we have not seen or spoken to her since Easter 2008 when her son choked my DD for not playing what he wanted to play and me & DH had a HUGE fight with her & her husband for yelling at one of MY kids (ha!) for defending her sister and hitting him back, and since then we decided to keep our kids far from hers for their own safety.    Oh and here's food for thought: He was kicked out of 2 preschools for behavioral issues (hitting) and his parents think the schools are picking on him! HUGE DENIAL!!!

My MIL constantly says rude and cold comments to me and about me to my friends & neighbors and has been a thorn in my marriage for all 8 years. She hates me with no reason, and I am not tooting my own horn, but seriously she has no reason. I am not a drinker, drug addict or a cheater. I love her son more than I love life itself and we have an awesome marriage with 4 amazing kids. The last straw was in June when she took my daughter somewhere me & DH told her she was forbidden to go with our DD and she did it anyway and basically when confronted told us she has every right to do what she pleases with her grand kids! I told her off so bad I left her head spinning and haven't seen her since. (Its been bliss full by the way) But my DH has since made amends with her and is urging me to do the same. She never apologized (its not in her genetic makeup) and I feel no desire to speak to her any longer since she does not respect me. She didn't see us or the kids for months and still made no attempt to rectify the situation so I know things will not change any time soon. I am not mad anymore, and I have no problem forgiving and letting go of my anger from what she did, but am I obligated to reconcile with her for the sake of my marriage and my DH?  I don't want to hurt my DH, but I don't want to open myself to be disrespected ever again by her. And she just cant help herself. So would I be considered cold and selfish if I cut her out of my life for my own sanity? I have no problem w/him seeing her and taking the kids as long as he supervises them and dont leave her alone with them to do as she pleases, I just want no part of it.

20090204230516AAZXg8Z	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it normal to get attached to the people you kiss?	I have had sex with only one person and got extremely attached to him. Since he and I broke up, I made out with a guy two nights in a row and now I really like him. The problem is that he is a manwhore and sleeps around so I guess there cant be anything there. How can I not think about him? I feel as attached to him as if we slept together or something but we only kissed. Is this weird?
20090205005019AALZSAa	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it O.K. for my son to be getting up at 6:30am to sleep with me at 14 years old?	When we both have to wake up one hour later at 7:30?       We both wake up at 7:30, when I have work and he has school. Every morning at 6:30; I'll find him fast asleep all curled up, hugging right on to me, and pretty tight! I think its SOO adorable and sweet. It really makes me feel good inside and just totally lucky, and I'm so happy for him because this is the first time in his life where he actually experiences love, affection and cuddling everyday; I adopted (now as a single mom) just last october, really just had abusive parents and a not so good childhood.Took a little over a month for him to completely open up to me and trust, and knew that I actually loved him and would never hurt him. Its basically that he just wants to spend that last hour with me to cuddle and to talk with eachother for a bit before we have to get up and ready.      That all being said, Is it O.K. as in Healthy in his development stage to just continue how its going? I just can't see how it would have any negative affects, but I would love to hear your opinion or input.. Its always just for that 1 last hour, but on weekends when there isn't school, he always wants to sleep with me. I'm completely fine with it on weekends. Thats when we might be up until 2-3 in the morning watching movies etc, thats usually when we spend the most time with eachother. But for now, is it not something I should really be too worried about, if its fine for now as he's still just hitting development?

Decided that when we were talking last night that now is the time to end it as things will never change with us.  Why am I sad then.  He said that females want a bad boy and dont want romance, but I did want romance (Im a Pisces... of course I want romance!) and I am sure other females would want the same.  Whats your opinion?  Guys out there do you not like females who need to be shown they are loved?  Much obliged.

20090204232317AAb7Gc5	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to break the news to my roommate without sounding mean?	She's so dirty. She washes her dishes and all... after letting it ferment for a couple of days in her room or sink. She never cleans the bathroom, vacuum, take out the trash, clean the kitchen.. unless I leave it to the point where it REEKS.    At first I didn't mind, but now I'm getting tired of cleaning up after her. For a while I tried to do the "I'll clean and make you feel bad about it and maybe you'll get a clue" thing, but she was completely oblivious.   I've made attempts to ask her "hey do you mind scrubbing the toliet?" or something small like that and she waits 2 weeks before she actually does it.   I don't want to sound like a *****. WHAT DO I DO????

20090204235430AAtqkCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What did I do wrong!?	I m confused and totally peeved! I was seeing this guy recently everything was fine till now.I didnt tell him I had a kid when we met,because I didnt think much was going to come out of us dating.I wasnt expecting things to progress this fast. After I tell him this he fesses up and tells me I was his first.He is 23 yrs of age and by all standards very goodlooking.Which was shocking to me ,becuase you dont meet guys of that caliber to be virgins.But he has been sooooo upset that I have a kid that he is refusing to talk to me.When I got to talk to him..he expressed to me that he wanted to ind someone he could spend his life with and he doesnt think that can happen because of my situation.Clearly he has some serious mental problems ..which he has expressed to me as well.I am trying to understand what the issue is here..but I cant seem to pin point what he getting at or what he is trying to say.Frankly I just dont want him to be traumatized.Should i call him or wait till he is willing to deal and talk to me again.I think he is been very immature about this whole thing .Pls give me an outside p.o.v on this.thank you
20090205002918AAjtoFh	Family & Relationships;Family	Stay in or out of relationship with half-sister?	Here's the deal: My father married the other woman (my step-monster) and had another child with her some years later. The step-monster was extremely unstable, violent, emotionally abusive, disparaging, the whole nasty and awful lot. Add to this scenario a lot of drinking on both her and my father's part, and some more violence, and you get a messed up me. Also add that they succeeding in convincing my sister that NONE of this happened, and you get nearer to the point of my question.      The rough childhood led to a rough life which I've miraculously made great strides in healing from. My sister dismisses my entire childhood history as a 'confused' memory. (She is considerably younger than I am and has no clear memories of my accounts.) The problem is that talking about my past (re: her mother) is totally off-limits. Which means, a major theme in my life is totally off-limits. The good progress, the growth, the bitter-sweetness - is all silenced. For her sake.      I don't want to rehash every blow from 25 years ago, but I also don't want to feel like I have to deny it happened. Advice?

20090204233130AAAAdUF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please Help! Having Problems with Ex-Girlfriend!!!?	Hi guys I know this is pretty long but please help me out if you can find it in your heart to aid a really down college student.      I will choose a best answer and dish out points whenever possible      Alright so basically, my ex-girlfriend and I broke up like 3 months ago because she said that she needed time to "grow up". Basically, we decided to still be friends because we really still like each other and get along great. However, I am still very much in love with her.      The problem is that lately I've been feeling really down around my ex and kind of jealous and I don't know why. She's basically perfect at everything. She's very attractive because a lot of guys flirt with her, wears size 00 pants, exercises constantly, her parents are wealthier than mine as she lives in a half a million dollar house and her dad retired at the age of 48, she always gets whatever she wants (material-wise) i.e. she has two pairs of Uggs, wears all Abercrombie clothing, gets the newest iPod every year, breaks her cell phone at least 3 times a year, has two pairs of Sperry type shoes, and gets Tiffany and Co. jewelry costing around $175 once a year (She gets all this stuff usually for Christmas or just because presents but she always gets whats on her list of wants), she makes friends easily, has time to join lots of clubs in college, works as a store model for Abercrombie and has a higher GPA than me while majoring in journalism, and sometimes I feel like she has all of God's blessing even though she is extremely atheist.      However, I am the complete opposite as I always work for what I get. I'm in one of the top 10 business schools in the nation but struggle to maintain a 3.0 GPA and spend most of my time studying, I haven't met very many people in college because I'm trying to save money by living at home with my parents (my ex lives in the dorms which her parents pay for even though her parents live 2 blocks away from campus), I spend all my free time at home, I don't find myself as attractive because I've only worked for American Eagle and I am Asian, my parents want me to earn things so I have to work to pay for my clothes, cell phone, car repairs and other stuff I want unlike my ex.      I just feel crappy to the point that I've been unmotivated to study and I want to sleep all day. I've stopped going to the gym and I have been wallowing in my own self-pity, I'm always wishing that my parents were a lot richer because my ex gets to finish college at her own pace while I'm pressured to finish in 4 while her parents can also afford to let her take summer classes not only at where we go to school but to other colleges such as New York University and/or Chicago to make her workload easier while I don't have that luxury.      The only thing I feel like I have an advantage over her is that I know how to invest and save my money better than her because she can't save her own money at all. She doesn't even know how the basic definition of a stock or how a credit and debit card work. I am very ambitious and always look for ways to make extra money through investing and saving but I always still feel down because I know that she'll still get ahead of me in the future because her father is already investing money for her for her retirement in the thousands already.      Despite all this I feel like God's let me down. Why does he bless people that don't believe in him? Should I stay away from my ex even though I still love her? She is white and we've known each other for 4 years and dated each other for 2 and a half years. Can a relationship with 2 different people like this work out again? Why do I feel this way? I get really jealous because no girls flirt with me at college compared to guys hitting on her. What should I do? Am I even in her league at all?

20090205000537AAmiIIk	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I do with my life now?	I have been playing an online game for the past 4 years since its release and it kinda took me over for awhile. Recently I got rid of the game and for the passed 3 weeks I have had this gaping hole in my time lol. I tried filling it with different games but none offer what the game has. Lately I got board and built a computer with brand new parts from scratch and I have restored my brother's laptop battery. Now Im thinking about making a play house for my sons complete with electric outlets and everything. Along with a Camera so we can keep an eye on them.      I was thinking about going to school for a few years to finish my grade 12 and heading to university or get a couple journeymans in carpentry and mechanics....       Im just trying to do something that really interests me and something that would make me feel in the least fulfilled. While playing the game I really beat myself down and got a low self esteem because I wasn't doing anything and my surroundings aren't as encouraging either. All we do is sit around here, from what I see, waiting to die....       I don't want to be that kind of person and I don't want to deal with that kinda stuff.
20090205010905AAxAroK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Mind games... how do you know how to react?	So you ask a serious question, and the person you like thinks you're joking, so they answer in a non-serious way. Then you take that non-serious answer seriously, and say something sarcastic to offset the awkward feeling which the person takes seriously. So you tell that person you were joking. He tells you he was joking. Then you don't know if him saying he was joking is serious or not. When does the madness end??!!??!?

20090205002359AArN5lx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this girl alot! And need advice!?	This girl and I go out for drinks a couple times a week.  I manage the restaurant she frequents.  On Super Bowl Sunday we finally got to hang out for an extended period of time.  We went to another bar and to her apartment for drinks.  She says she wants a 'good guy' which i am seriously!  We talked a lot and made out later.  She said I was a great kisser, we flirted all night, and had a great time.  She got sick and we couldn't take it past making out.  The next morning we hugged goodbye.  She didn't stop in Wednesday like usual.  We've talked since then, but from what i hear at work is she isn't the committed type.  But she hasn't been in a relationship for a couple of years.  We are both 26.  I guess I am asking, if she is the type that hasn't been in a serious relationship in a couple years, but her and I didn't do anything past first base, is she ready for something serious?  Does she really want the 'Good Guy'?  Need some advice big time!!!

If she wanted my attention she had it when I asked her, but why tell me she has a boyfriend and keep doing it?
20090204234719AA7mXAc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why doesn't my girlfriend trust me?	I have been going out with my girlfriend for close to 2 years now. When we first started going out i had to work in a city 3 hours away and visited her every two weeks on the weekend, plus any holidays i got. I have now moved back near her and see her constantly for the last 2 months.   I keep in contact with a female friend from my work in the other city and my girlfriend accuses me of cheating or at least really liking this other girl and that i want to be with her and not with my gf.   She also spies on my emails and sms, when she said she found emails (joke emails and funny pictures) form this other girl she accused me of cheating again, i changed my passwords and she got angry that i didn't trust her.   How can i assure her i am a good guy, i would never cheat on anyone i have seen what it does to couples and families and find it disgusting. i tell her i love her all the time, i spend as much time with her as i can and we do lots of stuff together.   i told her i wont let her dictate who i can and cant talk to, and who my friends are, and i have not done anything that justifies her invasion of my privacy and her lack of trust in me.   anyway, thank you to anyone who can give me some advice.

20090204231051AAcWiOA	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help talking to my parents?	Well, like many other people, I want to live away from home for college. My parents aren't too happy about that decision, though. I brought up the idea a long time ago and they just kind of brushed it off, thinking that I would change my mind. But, these past few months have really reinforced everything I had originally thought. I have lived in the same city for my whole life. There is barely anything to do here. And, I don't have any friends (haven't since I started high school). I just think I need a change of scenery, a new pool of people to be around. I am just so bored of my life here. College is suppose to be fun, and I know I won't have any fun staying in my parents' house staying in on weekends just watching TV.       I will be moving to live with my boyfriend (of four years) in his parents' house. At least I know if I go there, I will have the change I have been desiring, and I will have people I already know as a kind of "comfort zone." The problem is, they live on the other side of the country, so its not like I can jump on a plane anytime I want and come home to visit for a weekend. My time coming back home would be limited to winter and summer breaks.      My mom says that she has accepted the fact that I want to move away for school and that she is fine with it, but I know she is lying. She is a very emotional person and I just know that as the time gets closer to my graduation, she is going to be a wreck. My dad, on the other hand, seems angry. He thinks that I -asked- my mom about it and then -told- him. But, I -told- the both of them that I wanted to move, I never asked. He never got involved in the conversations, anyway, so I always talked about it to my mom more. Today, I was jokingly saying that in religion class, we were talking about the five stages of grief and how my teacher was saying how it not only applies to death, but it could apply to many other things, including a son/daughter graduating and moving away for college. He immediately brushed me off and said that he wasn't going through the "five stages of grief" (he said it in a very mocking and hurtful way).      I just don't know how to talk to them about this. I don't want them to have any harsh feelings towards me or my boyfriend (thinking that he is "stealing me away"). Advice?

ANY ADVICE??
20090204225515AAuZJQQ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Did he cheat, or I'm just being paranoid? Is it fixable? What is the best thing to do?	So I'm a senior in college, and I'll be graduating college in the spring. I am still struggling with problem from a 3-year relationship. We met freshmen year, and fell madly in-love. I was certain that I found the guy for me, when we met. The first year was amazing, we had some wonderful times, but I was non-trusting of him. I consistently doubted his love, and was always pushing him. I had a very low self-esteem so I was always questioning his love for me, and I got very jealous of the girls from his past (who were trying to break us up-immature actions). I pushed him, even though he never went out with them. As time went on, he started to become impatient, frustrated, and mean. He would call me names, and tell me things like how I was ruining his life.. Then we studied abroad together for a semester, and this is the part that I question if he cheated or not..      We fought like crazy during our study abroad experience. He ended up being in a group project with all girls, and I was very jealous of one of them. I found a picture of a girl from his group project saved on his computer, and he said he had no idea how it got there, and I shouldn't be snooping. He then would get mad at me, and when drinking, told me that I was ruining his life, and I make him miserable. He told me that he met someone there, and there was a lot of things that I didn't know. He said she made him want to be open with me, and realize how much him and I didn't have. Come to find out he kept the fact that he smoked from me the whole time we dated, and he was sobbing about it. (I wouldn't have cared anyways). Then he told me he wanted a break for the summer, but not tell anyone in the program because he didn't want drama, so I didn't. He was extremely mean to me, and the girl that I questioned, he said was just a friend, and I should stop being so paranoid, and it really hurts him that I would ever question him like that. He said I should grow up and handle the fact that he has friends. As time went on, we went through our break, and I asked mutual friend about her and him. His response was, "Sometimes you just meet someone that you wonder what it would be like to be with, other than your girlfriend." My boyfriend still denies this, and says the friend is lying to me. He has said that he wants to be back with me, and has been trying to win me back since September. However, I found an email in October that he sent the girl saying, "I will never forget the times that we had together. You made me realize who I was and who I needed to be, and I will always owe you for that. Being with you was when I was the happiest, and whenever I stop to think about what I should do in life, I think of you." Now I was furious, and he told me she was only a friend, and I should suck it up and man up. He said he's told me everything there is to tell, and I need to stop being paranoid and asking about it. Now if I ask about it, he'll hang up the phone on me, or block me.       What should I do? Do you think I was just being paranoid? If I'm not, I know it's best to let him go, but it makes me FURIOUS, and I just am having a hard time being mature about this. I want to handle it in a mature fashion. Lastly it hurts because he doesn't care, he even said I don't care if I'm with you or not, you make me miserable, and the all the accusations will never end unless you leave. Yet at the same time he'll still talk to me, and doesn't want me to be with anyone else. He always puts the blame on me, the reason why he didn't have any money was because of me, why he drank me, etc.. He said that I just drained him, it was always take, take, take, and that makes me feel awful. My friends and family think he's manipulative and abusive, but for some reason I don't think he is. I think I contributed in some ways. He told me that he knows he wants me, but he can't let himself care because it seems like I don't want him anymore. My question is, do you think he cheated, or do you think I'm truly being paranoid and should let it go? If you do think he cheated, how can I get the strength to let it go?   .    Additional Details   Additionally I feel like I pushed him to cheat with how jealous I got, so I could understand why it happened. And I'm not sure if he even cheated, maybe he just liked her more than me. He told me it was nice talking to someone that wasn't always complaining and mad at him. He said he felt like he could be himself with her. Why does he deny it, and get really really mean when I ask about it?

Hi, i'm currently living at home with my parents, i'm 17, starting college in about a week but finding it really hard at home at the moment, my parents are great the only person i have a problem with is my sister, she's in her 20s, indebt for a large sum of money, i think she's on drugs and is a thief.      Over the years heaps of stuff has been stolen from my room, mostly money. I've caught her stealing my stuff numerous times and just the other day i come into my room and over 11 of my ps2 games were gone, well anyway she said to mum she took them and sold them to cash converters and if i say anything to my mum about my sister (even though it may concern stuff of mine gone missing) i get into trouble because i am 'picking on her' wtf am i mean't to do?      She walks around the house and treats everyone like garbage, when we were younger she also used to pick on me a lot with her friends, one time she had 2 of her friends over, both guys (i was only like 7 or 8) and they gave me a black eye because they thought it would be fun to hold my arms behind my back while they threw stuff at me.      I don't want to live here anymore because of her, but i'm currently unemployed, have no cash left recently used the last of it to do my motobike pre learner course and i don't want to stick around here because one day i'll probably punch her in the head. What do you guys think i should do could really use some suggestions or advice.      Thanks

20090204232138AALSk56	Family & Relationships;Family	Keeping in touch with feuding family?	DH and I have not talked to our in-laws (his parents) in 5 years due to some poor choices of actions on their part.  In those 5 years we have almost no contact from them except nasty phone calls, so we quit answering, they leave nasty messages.  Then they start texting and showing up at DH work to cause problems.     About a year ago we tried to resolve our issues with them and they promised they changed and would not cause problems and it lasted about 2 months and we expressed our issues with them and we haven't talked since.  Nasty calls, texts, work visits start up again.      Just a few days ago we switch phone providers but our old service is still active for one more week.  DH sister sends a text to his old numbers to say that MIL has to have two lumps biopsied.  We were not going to give them our new phone numbers because of ongoing problems but we both feel he should be aware of her condition.  He wants to give them his new phone number- which means they keep being mean, too.  I suggest he only give them my number, they know I don't tolerate their behavior so it would never happen with me and this way they can reach him if something changes with her condition.        We aren't seeing eye to eye on that- what would you do?

20090204231850AAAZzS8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marriage is Outdated!?	I mean government has no place whatever in defining or recognizing marriage. It should be strictly a private matter, as it can be exploited as a means to get some cheap benefits from the government. Let any couple, opposite sex, same sex, man and dog, siblings have any bond they want, and they can call it whatever they want. But government shouldn't recognize this bond.       Life would be so much easier if they just did this. Why don't they?

20090204232600AAuXD6Y	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is there a Good Way to Confront the Other Woman?	I realize that many think that you should never do this. But my case is strange.       Just found out that my husband of 6 years has been texting a woman who he had a previous relationship with prior to meeting me. They 'bonded' in their first year of college, then remained in the same group of friends during the years that my husband and I dated.... During which time they 'hooked up' a few times on college reunion weekends.    I knew in my gut what was going on, but chose not to address it the way i should have, probably because I was too young to know any better.    The woman worked her way into my husband's family. Taking on his mother and sister as best friends. I don't know what she told them about me, but they never liked me. Not from day 1.       I just found out that just before our wedding, the woman told my husbands entire family about their one night stand, my husband's sister didn't come to the wedding, and his mother didn't speak to me and refused to be in Any pictures. Since then my husband's family has cut him off and now we're dealing with his very real depression.         My husband and I are committed to working on our relationship, but I want to tell this woman that I am finally ready to stand up for myself. I am done with her disrespecting me...it's been 13 years.       I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to say something to this woman, so Is there a good way to confront the other woman?
20090204232713AAZiTbM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did my husband cheated on me?	We've been married for 8 yrs. now. We have a 3 yr. old.  Last year, I was able to intercept a phone call from his female co-worker.  She wanted a favor for him to get a food-run for her.  I confronted my husband & said, she was just a co-worker.  I checked his cell phone bill and cought several phonecalls he made to her and her to him.  Although the minutes were not long and not alarming but the longest was 20 minutes conversation.  What's up with that?  I asked him about all the calls and of course he won't admit anything. He said, it was all about work.  But how come he DID NOT tell me about the girl?  He kept it and did not tell me that he calls a female co-worker.  When I found out, I called the gilr and asked, she said my husband calls her once in a while but it was just about work, but the girl did not sound very convincing to me.  She was not even apologetic about it and seemed she did not care.  I got so upset and confronted myhusband.  Of course, they will not admit on anything.  I want to know if the phone calls are enough evidence that he cheated on me or not.  My mind keeps telling me that he cheated, my intuition tells me he did.  What do I need to do?  After what happened to us, I have lost trust in him and I don't think I will ever trust him again.  I'm still with him bec. of our son but, I really want out of the marriage bec. he betrayed my trust.  It's hard for me to forget and I don't think I will ever forget what he has done.  They started talking last year from Feb-May.  I want to know if he cheated on me or not.  I hate the fact that I'm with a person who cheated on me just because I don't have a real evidence.  Is there anyway I could find out if he really did cheat on me? I am a true believer of once a cheater, always a cheater.  Any suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks :)

20090205001233AAhL4vf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Heard her talking about me to another guy?  Is she interested?	Yeah, so I met this new girl today in my college class. Shook hands (5 second handshake haha), traded names, said hi. Anyhow, this other guy sitting next to her met her first so they were already talking for a while.      She's a new transfer so she has no friends here. Anyways, I told her my name was "Edison" even though I go by Eddy. I told her "Yeah, I'm actually the real Thomas Edison. I wrote all that crap you learn in school." She laughs and goes "Ohh, well, good job with everything! You did a really nice job there"      Anyhow at the end of class I started walking out and right then she turns to the other guy and goes "Omg thats such a cool name."      On the way down the stairs, I stopped to get something. They started walking down and I still hear her in the middle of her convo going, "....yeah, but Edison...its a cool name" I pop out and start walking towards the exit and she obviously saw me and shut up haha. Anyways, do you think that means anything?      3 days ago she saw me in class (where I looked like myself) and stared at me, then flicked her hair back. Today I did not look like myself at all, unshaven, 1 hour of sleep, swollen face, you know the whole deal, so I'm not sure if she was just being friendly or not. On a scale of 1-10, shes an 8.

20090204235128AAgdHS7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I judge if the girl of my parents choice for arranged marriage will be a good life partner?	My parents want me to meet 3-4 girls as they are planning for arranged marriage. I have never met them & seen only theirs photograph & brief bio-data.   Meetings are going to be very short (some formalities with their families & half an hour we will be alone) and there will not be any other contact with the girls before saying "yes" to one of them.   I am already 30 and girls are also in their mid twenties so I don't think same interests or hobbies are necessary, as we are mature enough to adjust.   So what should I ask them and their families to come to a decision. And first & most important thing how should I start.

20090205000355AAYiqMn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do You Think She Likes Me or Not? And What is My Next Move!?!?	Okay, well first off I am a grade 12. And not until this year I have become really close with this girl, although we've never gone out. I mean close as in texting constantly, flirting at school, hanging out, and even on a few occasions alone. Before you think im in the friend zone for good realize I never made my move 1. she has never kissed anyone period/ever had a boyfriend (which makes me hesisitant) 2. my bestfriend liked her way before I did. This girl has a great sense of humor however she's can be anti-romantic (although can flirt/touch, etc) which im assuming is because of a lack of experience. However now that I asked her to graduation (prom) and she said yes, things are good and I will make my move if you guys think I should. I flirt with her much more then anyone else and she gives me more attention then she does to any other guys although she's definitly clever enough to show that I have her (if she does in fact like me/wants to start something) and she seems to always think i'm into her one friend - who i am also close with but there's nothing there (which i find out - she doesn't tell me). I feel the smaller the group (us and a couple, or just us) brings out the best in her but i just asked her to grad a week ago. Just asking her to hang out alone won't just make her think I don't like her friend and that I'm in to her cause she analyzes things negatively. Does she like me, and how could I find out forsure if she does/doesn't? & now that I've asked her to prom, what do I do from here? Please put as much input as you can, every idea/comment/suggestion is appreciated greatly. THANKS.
20090205001002AAHmten	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I lost my true love some 3 years back but i still could not forget him.?	Now i am married and he knows everything about my past. He is very nice and loving person. He loves me and understands my feelings. But i could not have love in my heart for him. I'm trying my best but still could not give him his love.

He recently moved and wanted me to come with him.  I didn't really want to since my parents frowned upon "shacking up" but he reassured me that after a couple months of living together he would know if we were ready to get married.        Its been 6 months of living together now, and he still doesn't know.  Well he actually says "I know I want to marry you, just not right now".  The problem is that I gave up my friends my family, everything to move out to a new city with him.  I feel so rejected, as if I'm just "there" for him.      What should I do? Should I wait for him to be ready? Should I leave?

20090205004440AAgboUi	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm infatuated with a girl I know? Does this mean I'm gay?	I've recently become friends with a girl. She's an art student and REALLY pretty and funny. Whenever I think about her/or the prospect of seeing her...I get really jittery. Am I gay? I don't like her in a sexual sense, but I'm not completely grossed out by being "close" to her...if it was sexual.      What do you think this means?
20090205002341AA42UQ5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm SO nervous around the guy I like? [REALLY need your help, please?]?	And when I say "so" I mean I freeze up, start shaking, can't manage to say anything... it's pretty full on.   I've liked him for awhile and it used to never affect me this much, but I've noticed it's so much more severe now.   He's approached my group a few times but I just can't say anything to him. If he ever spoke to me I don't know what I would do or say, if I could say anything.   I usually have to remove myself from the situation when he approaches me & my friends.      Also, he does look at me a lot (even if he doesn't realize I notice, and my friend also said that he was staring at me...), and he'll follow me with his eyes as I walk past (I don't get nervous when I walk past for some reason) and recently he's been approaching my group a lot (as Ive been saying)   So do you think he may like me?      I just wish I could calm down and talk and not make a complete a$$ out of myself and have actual words come out.   I've tried to just relax, take deep breaths... it doesn't work.   I need any help I can get! Thanks!

I don't understand how guys can just flip flop like that...

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and half and I just bought him a simple stainless steel ring with "From your sweetie" engraved on the inside. Is this too much? It's not a promise ring or anything like that.      He wears rings normally so jewelry is not something he is uncomfortable wearing.
20090205002958AAqokCf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need some dating advice, what should I do?	Ok, so there's this guy who's one of my bestfriends, who i've know for years, and during that time that i've know him he had tried to ask me out a number of times but I usually change the conversation even tho I did like him, because.... basically all of my friends who had dated him told me that he cheated on them and thats why they realationship ended, and also as soon as he broke up with someone he asked someone else out, sometimes the same day. Last month however he told me that I was the only one he really wanted to be with and the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, he also made it clear that most of the girls he was with were just using him, he had also propose to this one girl and a few weeks later the relationship ended cus SHE cheated on him. Tonight I hanged out with him and some friends and he told me that he was looking for a grad date...Was that a hint for me? and he gived me a hug that seemed like it was never going to end, while everyone was there watching us weirdly. I also kissed him on his cheeks when I was leaving to go home and I told him I love him...was that a dumb thing to do? anyways when I got home I signed into msn and he came online and asked me if I meant it when I said I love him and if I love him only as a friend or more. I told him I love him but I couldn't tell him if I love him as a friend or more cus the truth is I don't really know. When ever I think about being his gf, I keep getting these images of my bestfriends crying cus he cheated on them. Also he's bi-sexual and he smokes and most of my family and friends of my family are against anyone who has feelings for the same sex and against ppl who smoke. I for one don't have any problems with anyone who like the same sex but I do dislike smokers because i'm kind of allgeric to smoke, but still that doesn't stop me from hanging out with him when he smokes even tho it makes me cough, gasp for air (sometime) or it'll make my eyes water and burn like if i'm cutting onions. He know's that i'm allergic and he tries to stay away from me when smoking....that is when I don't follow him. There was also this think thats my friends invited me to, its in 3 days and he asked me if I was going and I don't him I don't know and he told me he had to go but call him and let him know if i'll be going. Do you think that if I go he'll consider it a date or something? Should I date him and bear the consequences later? Do you think the girls he dated were really using him? was he trying to get me jealouse when he dated some of my friend? I have so many questions but I already wrote to much...........sorry about that.............but if anyone can give me some good advice, I would really appreciate it....also I grad 2 years ago and he's the same age as me but he failed a couple of classes, thats why he's only gradding now, but yea please help.

Since that, we only talk for 3-4 times.       2 weeks later, he told me he had another girlfriend. But couple days later they suddenly broke up.      I misses him so much, so I decided to talk to him about it.   So, today I was like, "Will u back together with me again?"   And he was like, "I dont know."   I was like, "What should I do to make u say yes?"   He said, "Dont push me. I prefer we have reguler meeting before we decided to back in romance again."   And I was like, "Okay."      After that we have a nice conversation. He talks about things happened to him when we broke up. And then he give me a warm hug after that.      Question: do u think he will say yes eventually and back with me, or he's just seeking a temporary partner while looking for another girl?

20090205010259AAM1hOq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be mad at my Fiance?	My fiance and I have a generally good relationship. As of late we have been going through things (my ill health including back problems, UTI's and resulting miscarriage, which has made it so he has to take care of me.) As of Sunday my fiance has become overly friendly with my roommate/ Best friend. She use to not touch him at all but now they hug and she refers to him as her "cuddle buddy" also monday he spent all day cuddling in her bed and only came to me for sex, and to shower with me. She has been hugging him a lot lately and he lying in her bed. She is now  getting involved in our couple talks as well as seemingly making decisions for him (ex. he got sick at my house and we decided to take him to the hospital, I left the room for 5 mins and all of the sudden they had totally changed hospital plans, to ones that excluded me and then when they thought it was something serious she told me not to come to the hospital that I would not be let in!) She also is now saying  "I love him too!" I explained to him that this makes me uncomfortable and he basically told me i was being jealous and not trusting him, that she is just opening up to him.He says I should know he loves me by all he has done for me. But they have been staying up all night talking and such (something we use to do.) Am I being jealous or is he out of line?
20090205010401AAA8AXu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dunno what to think about this?	I dated a guy in high school on and off for over 2 years. When we were together we fooled around and got close to having "actual" sex. I was a 16 year old junior when I missed my period for a little over two months. I never took a pregnancy test (stupid I know) because I wasn't supposed to be dating him any way, let alone fooling around. I had some of the symptoms of pregnancy and miscarriage. I didn't ever tell him about it until a few months ago (I'm almost 19 now). We'd been broken up for almost 2 years. I only told him because I felt guilty by not telling him about it... but we'd had such a very unstable relationship while dating, I was scared of what he might do. He wasn't abusive, but we broke up and got back together so many times. It wasn't healthy. And during one of our breakups (that lasted about a day or two) he got a BJ from one of my old friends. He never told me about it and i found out through her when she came crying to me about how a terrible person she was. That was after I'd gotten back with him and we'd broken up for good.      There's no way to tell if I was pregnant or not since it was so long ago, but I feel like I can't get over it. I know it is possible to get pregnant without him going in... it's happened to someone I know. Any advice?      My current boyfriend hasn't said much about it when I told him about it. He's my best friend and he doesn't judge me for my past. He and his ex had a couple scares themselves. He did tell me that I need to just let go of the past because there's no way to know, so I can concentrate on the future.

20090205011730AAmBP5H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If this chick is slutty or real?	Alright guys, well i have a gf who is younger than me by a year difference. I'm currently a junior and she is a sophmore. The minute we started going out people were criticizing me for going out with this so called slut? We talked alot and we clicked real well. When i asked her about her previous relationships, she told me she regretted everyhting and she hates her past. So i said woe this chick made some mistakes but she might be sincere and at the time of those relationships, just you know, not perfect. The problem is she was crazy in love with one of my good friends. She would make signs for him and everything, copy his number, listen to the music he did and its like wow. Now that were going out she somewhat doing the same thing for me. And she is CRAZY IN LOVE with me. The catch is a bunch of people are telling me that she had sex with the guy she was crazy for way before we even knew each other. Its like everytime i see her its like im seeing my friend. So i asked her if it was true and she denies it with agression. As if what kind of question is that. Yet the evidence is just their and one of my good friends told me the same thing. I just feel disapointed. I just dont know if she's telling the truth or not????????

20090205012804AAGmkN6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help? Im confused about this guy im talking to.?	Me and this guy have been talking online for sometime to texting eachother.A total of 9 months exactly we been communicationg.We both have yet to meet ,cause i dont't have a car and neither does he. Well he told me a while back when we were talkin that he was saving up for a car. And that was May of lastyear since he said that. We had a conversation a month ago  about his future goals and he mention of wanting to go back to school.The thing is he had to pay off a 13,000 dollars school loan back before he can go back again. But the last thing he told me that at this moment he is trying to just get a car. So I asked him are u close to getting one or do you have some ways to go. He replied, close. Now a week has passed since he said that,and he text me tonight saying ,that he's thinkin of how me and him are going to work, I said arent you close to getting a car,or did something happen to change that,he replied: that he have to pay off  his student loans.

20090205013524AArbnDC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm going off my boyfriend quick, help!?	My boyfriend has no direction about what he wants to do, he has no qualifications and is not interested in anything apart from travelling america.  He is content with going with the flow. Now in my future I'm clear about what I want to do, I don't want it just yet but I want to feel comfortable with money and nice things. My boyfriends lack of direction is becoming a big turn off especially when he constantly moans about how rubbish his life is. I have tried to my wits end to speak to him about how miserable he is but he will only ever discuss things when its suits him, which often means we argue. I just don't know what I should do, should I just end it and find someone who wants similar things to me? I don't care what he does in his life just as long as he doesn't whinge about how rubbish his life is but doesn't do anything about it!
20090205014245AAi5qze	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help judge this sender's attitude & intentions ?	He was not happy with his girl friend of 3 years, sent an email, followed by 5 more.   She replied once, only after the last email.   First email, blaming, then to justify, long stories, next, tried to find a solution, then last email, decided to call it quits. These actions (his)happened a few times before, everytime when there were issues between them.   Could anyone there help judge or describe the sender's character attitude or intentions?

20090205053151AABNK3D	Family & Relationships;Family	Would a notarized living will, could retain my step daughter with me?	Our case is that my husband obtain permanent custody of his little girl, because her mother was very neglective while under her mother's care she was molested three times by her mother's husband which the mother still lives with. My husband has a somehow dangerous job, he is an Iron Worker and he is due to go to Ohio in a couple of days, but I was thinking, can a legal notarized document made by him appointing me as the child legal guardian would stand in court? or would I  loose my daugther to her maternal side of the family, I have raised her for three years and I am afraid that if something GOD FORBIDS happends to my husband, I would loose her. Her maternal side didn't believe her when she accused her step father of molestation and they always blamed her for all that happened to her mother. But I know they will fight to get her because they hate me, I was the one who called the cops and reported everything and helped my husband gain custody of her.  PLEASE SOME ADVICE.

20090412114013AAwdJmR	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I open my dad's eyes to stop enabling my mom?	I'm an adult, and I'm tired of seeing my mom abuse my dad's love for her by abusing prescription (RX) drugs.  She's been abusing the RX for 15 years, while I did live at home with her.  I've since graduated HS, and moved out and moved on.  now she's still up to the same old stuff.  I know I need to get it through to my dad before I can ever get help for my mom.  their insurance does cover rehab, I verified that with him.  I told him flat out she needs rehab.  but they aren't really the "rehab" types.  They're in their 50's and stubborn as mules.  am I fighting a lost cause?  Should I just leave them to their dynamics?  I don't want my kids to be exposed to this (when the day comes when I have kids), and I want her to be better by then.  I want my mom back, I hate this version of her.  But he is enabling her...  how do I get him to stop enabling her so I can get her treatment?  He won't go to AL-ANON.  Any magical words I can say?  Has anyone been through this before?  What did you do?

20090205032621AA8aajB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think of this?	My husband and I have been married for almost 9 months, and we are already living apart. He seems to think that it is ok, and I told him twice already that it is not alright and that he needs to come home. Basically, he feels it is ok for a married man to go out once a week and come home drunk, or close to it. In spite of everything, I just found out I am pregnant, I am now 7 weeks along and he doesn't seem to get it. And on top of that, he seems to expect me to pay for everything in the house while he keeps his paycheck, and I am not buying that. We live in an apartment, and he did pay half of the rent, but I usually bought groceries, I paid for cable, and I paid for water and heat all of the time.On top of that I have a car note and insurance, and I never have money. Basically, I am tired of it, and I told him I am not doing that anymore and that he needs to help. What do you think of that ? Should I just divorce him and get it over with? I can't date because I am pregnant now. I don't know what to do, but I do know I am getting tired of him. Serious answers please. Thanks!
20090205030836AAkAb3T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal to feel like this?	I'm seventeen years of age and I keep thinking that there's a girl out there somewhere who is my perfect match. The main thing I look for in a girl is a great personality who always is relatively attractive. I prefer quiet, sensitive girls who are down-to-earth. Intelligence and sophistication are also key characteristics. I don't like girls who enjoy drinking alcohol. smoking cigarettes, taking drugs or going out partying. I just want to find that perfect partner in the next few years or so because I plan on travelling and that's something I would like to with my girlfriend. It may come across as desperate but I'm really not. I just want to know whether I will ever meet my ideal girl or not. What do you think? Thanks.

20090205033417AAHwcEi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, I'm not sure what to think about this. Can you give me some advice?	I lost my first love in an auto accident when I was a Sophomore in high school. I was not in the vehicle. Her older sister (was a senior at the time) found my email address and we have been talking on a regular basis. Nothing really in particular, but the one thing she always goes back to is how hard it must have been for me to lose my first love. She told me I could come over to her house anytime day or night and talk. There seems to be some kind of morale dilemma here. What are your thoughts?

I can't do this anymore, I know she probably doesn't feel the same way. (more like definitely) So should I go through with my plans on not chatting with her ever again.

She has been showing signs of liking me such as being shy around me, talking to my friends, paying attention to me the most in a group, looking into my eyes when we talk, and telling me good job when I swim. Also tonight at waterpolo she was on the other team and was quite willing to be allover me and touch me but did not do that to any other boys. Any how, we do not talk much because we are both shy. I know both of her parents pretty well and she knows my mom and not my dad who thinks she is a really nice girl. My mom however has her own cleaning business and cleans the house of this girl i like.

20090205035315AA33Ct6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help! - What should I text him?	I went out with a guy 2 weeks ago. At first the date went really well, we really clicked, then it started to go to my head cuz he was very good looking and cool and giving me a lot of attention so I started to show off and acted immature and things were kind of on the cold side at the end. I texted him when I left and he didn't text back. Then 2 days later I texted something sarcastic, he texted back he didn't understand what I meant and I explained it and then that was the last time we have been in contact.    Ideally he'd call or text and since he hasn't it obviously means he's not interested, but I really wish I'd get a second chance because like I said the first half of the date went really really good and we had connected, so if I send him one last text to try to get him to see me, what should I text him? I don't want to make it a simple let's go out where he can say no easily and then I really couldn't contact him again otherwise it would be like stalking and I'd be setting myself up for rejection, so any ideas what I can text? If you were him, what text would get you interested to communicate? Please help!! I really like him a lot!
20090205031413AAwG1sO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have You Ever Had An Online Guy Friend?	I met this really nice guy on a chatting website. I'm 18 and he is 19.  Pennsylvania and I live in Georgia. Him and I are really great friends, and we have the same interests. He plays guitar and writes his own music. He just recently put some of his music on the computer so I can listen. It is really amazing. Every time I get on the computer I can't wait to get an email from him. Yesterday he found me on myspace and wrote to me. That's how we are talking now because it is a lot easier. He is really a cool guy to talk to and I am not sure if what I am doing is ok. I think it is but then again I could be wrong. I really like this guy. What should I do?
20090205072407AAJVAfF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think people should live together before marriage?	Moving in together is a huge adjustment. Do you think people should live together before making the huge commitment of marriage to see if they could live together? Once you are married its not as easy to get out..of course. People move in together and soon decide they can't stand each other. Not always. But do you think it could lower the divorce rate? I don't think it necessarily would, but I think it would give people a better idea of what they are getting themselves into. What do you think?

20090204150852AAQdHE7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone help me? I don't understand this guy...?	Thanks for reading this. I know it's long but I really need help. This is driving me insane. Just read as much as you want and comment on that. Anything is appreciated.      There's this guy, and we get assigned partners in class, and we always end up being partners. Each of us make a big deal and complain and say we hate each other. We're gonna be partners again soon and I don't know how to act cause as much as I hate him, I like him too. But then he talks to me (90% of the time he starts the conversation) and his best friend has started talking to me a little more. He talks about mostly school related stuff that really isn't important or significant. One time when we were working on a project a while ago, he actually called me to ask me if it was okay to change something but it was really small and insignificant and he could have just told me the next day. Then the other day the guy blushed after I said something and his best friend told my best friend that there was something going on there. Before winter break we talked a lot and it seemed like maybe there was something there, but the we stopped talking and I got over him. And now, a few weeks after break hes started to try to talk to me again and I realized I like him again. I don't think he likes me because I never think I'm good enough. When he looks at me...it doesn't seem like there's anything there. What do you think?      What does he think of me? Does he like me? What should I do? I'm shy and can't flirt but I want to do SOMETHING cause where we are right now is not working for me.      Oh and my friends say we act like an old married couple. That we're cute when we fight which makes no sense. Also, when we were doing a dissection once he stuck the animal in my face and smiled. What does that mean?

20090205032922AABf7YV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend crazy or am i juss being ridiculous?	So me and my boyfriend were having a conversation. He was telling me about how he hates himself and about how everything in his life is going wrong. He was saying that things are going good right now but he's afraid that they may go bad again.      So i gave my advice. I said (in a polite, calm voice): i know that things aren't going well but you're lucky that you have your parents. They're paying for your cna program, giving you a car, and cosigning for your apartment. That's more than what my parents will ever do for me. The reason why I always find the strength to go on during my hard times is because whenever I fall down I always know that there is a way for me to get up. Everyone falls but we all get up.       Then he gets mad and says that all he wanted was for me to comfort him. Is it wrong for me to give my advice? I wasn't mean about it at all. He's always pitying himself and i wish that he would stop.

20090204090001AAUWSBY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to back out of the engagement?	I had been dating my fiance for over 3 months.   He proposed and at that time I said it was way to early.  He told me I could keep the ring as a commitment to our relationship.    I wore the ring, then 5 months later he had some confessions.   For example he was married 3 times not just once.   The car he was driving was his daughter's car and not his.   Though these are not necessarily deal breakers, but I would have liked to known earlier!   I feel like the last 5 months were a lie.   Maybe he gave me the ring and then wanted to tell me so I felt "obligated" to stay together.   I don't feel obligated and I am not happy about being lied to.   My feelings have changed for him and I am always wonder "is that the truth and/or the entire truth" when he talks now.  We were living together when he told me.  I simply view him differently now.  Do you think it is wrong to ask him to leave.   Should I simply tell him my view of him is differently knowing he lied to me?   Any ideas or suggestions?

20090205031720AAu0T84	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What am I supposed to do? Please help!?	I was with my ex for a year. He moved to another state and I went to visit him. After that, we both still loved each other, and he said he was going to move home to be with me again, but then he put the date off for it, and after a long line of disappointment and heartache, I gave up. I'm still madly in love with him.    We truly ended all thought of us getting back together in September, and I still can't get over it. It's gotten ridiculous. We're still very close and talk a lot, but I've been trying not to mention anything about 'us' and have slept with a few other people sice him. I think it was my way of trying to cope with the fact that he didn't want me anymore. I stopped calling him (I needed to give him a break from my stupid obsessive ex crap, he doesn't deserve to have to listen to how messed up I am) and he's the one to call me now.      The real problem is that he called me a couple of days ago, saying that he's having trouble getting regular work where he is, and he's pretty sure he's going to be moving home within the next couple of months.   After trying so hard to get over him, and forcing myself not to contact him so much, I'm now face with the fact that he might be in the picture again. I don't know what to do. I feel like this is going to undo all my good work, even though I'm pretty sure he won't want to be with me again. I don't know.      Why does he call me so much now? What's going to happen? And most importantly, what am I meant to do if he comes back?      I have almost NO willpower or self control when it comes to him. Please help. What sucks the most is that he really is an amazing guy.

20090205023453AAB50A7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	"Just tell them you like them"!  Why do people give such terrible advice?	I have a huge pet peeve that's starting to get to me,      I have  read a ton of people on this board say "just tell them you like them". What???  This urban legend needs to be stopped.      I keep hearing many females who say "Why did he just say 'I like you' when I hardly even know him" , "Things were going so well, why did he say that, it's awkward?." and "What am I supposed to say now, I don't even know him?"      It's even worse for boys.  Boys like to chase.  Not to be chased.  If you tell a boy that it won't work 99/100 and you've lost your chance for ever.      This is the definition of a relationship killer. Ladies and gentlemen, please learn, do not do this until you really get to know someone.        Boys, actions speak louder than words, Girls know we are doers, not talkers, You can show them you like them and she'll understand. Then, when she's really into you, you can say it. And it will mean infinite times more.      Girls, boys like subtlety.  To be subtle really gets us going because it's so feminine. 10 little actions will drive us 1000X harder than one big I like you.  Actually that's a death nail to 99% of guys.  And if they like it, they're usually a player anyways.      So please stop giving this terrible advice.      If I saved one poor suckers life today, it was worth it.  Good luck,

20090205035815AAeYzAB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So now he is gone, And im left here alone?	I have just started travelling, And I have recently just got back from one of my trips. I stayed at a Youth Hostel, I met a guy from another country who was also staying at the Hostel. I was only staying there for a week but during that week me and home got so close, we were practically acting like we were dating even to the point where we were sleeping together. Then it came time for me to leave, we said our goodbyes. And i havent heard from him since! He has now gone back to his country, and there is a chance I could be pregnant. I miss him so much, and ever since i got back from my trip i have been so upset and feeling rejected. I dont know what to do?! Does anyone have any tips on how to let go??
20090205022614AACrslf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Im strongly considering..?	Running away.  Im sick of this town same people same faces.

20090205022106AA22QR5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How would you respond (very long)?	Why is it my responsability to make sure my husband treats me like a human being?  It truly does not make sense to me, that I am supposed to move out w/ my 13 year old son, start a new life, just so he stops being a selfish asshole.   It wasn't always like this. About 5 yrs. ago my 24 year marriage started taking a wrong turn.  I used to be the stronger one in our relationship and he always seemed to be content with that.  I was the one who handled the money, the one who planned all the trips, the one who handeled the kids punishment (22 and 23 yr old daughters and a 13 yr old boy), and most of the responsabilities.   My sister in law told me the other day that I have changed so much that my old self is not even reconizable. i didn't even see all these changes happening, but she is rite.  She also said (in so many words) that my husband treats me so badly now because I allow it.  That if I became the person who I always was, then he would not be such a lying, self centered, abusive asshole.  Basically, it's my fault he's such an asshole now, because I allow him to be (huh?). I got the same advise from several "answers" on this web site as well.  I understand what I am being told, yet I don't.  Tonite for instance, we have been getting along for a whole 3 days now. Then, like clockwork, another lie. Rite to my face.  I caught him red- handed.  Everytime he goes anywhere or does anything, it has to involve his selfish behavior and lies. Simple things, like going to the store or running an errand.  Things that most people don't even think about, they just do it.  Not in this marriage, everytime he leaves, my stomache hurts.  How sick is it that your spouse can't even go help out a friend without it turning into a deceitful situation.  Usually I'll call him on it when he gets home and he'll tell me that it's all in my head, that I love drama.  It escalates to a fight, where I am demanding to be treated like a wife should be treated.  Not tonight. I am writing this "question" instead.  I can't help it, it hurts and I don't understand.       My question is this-how am I letting him treat me like this? How is it,  by me trusting what he tells me, my fault?  I really do not know what I am supposed to do.  Any advise?

20090204151453AAXy5qT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This guy and me.. I can't tell..?	So in my grade there's this boy who I've been talking to a lot in the past 4 months. We sit by each other in algebra, spanish, and science, but we end up talking in every class somehow. We end up always making fun of each other, and sometimes I catch him staring at me, while he catches me doing the exact same thing. He often says, "shut up" to me and then laughs. He always puts a smile on my face, and vice versa.   Today after school my mom was late picking me up, and so was his mom (ironic!). We sat in the empty hall talking to each other and we had a serious conversation about our families and what we do on weekends, etc. etc. Normally we don't talk like that.. but I loved it. I'm thinking I like him, but I donno if he likes me back. What do you think?

I was with my boyfriend for a year and split just under two weeks ago, we had a nice, emotional chat and promised to remain good friends.   he said there was nobody else and we were good.   However id noticed his ex had been getting a bit too cosy with him, i asked her if there was feeling involved and she said yes, so i told him and he said ive been gettin to like her a bit recently, by this point weve been split 4days, i was devastated, as his ex knew we split and was being totally *****.   Then i found out 6 days after the break up he was now 'seeing' her, again i was angry about it.   then college started again and she was all over him and i couldnt handle it, i told him and he just apologised. and now he is saying its hard on him because im his best friend really and i wont hang with them two, obviously   what do i do in a situation like this?    p.s its now 1 week and 4 days since the split and we have had sex twice and weve kissed, not again though

Last year I met this dude - things weren't going well with my my husband so I really flirted with this guy made him c um a few times with this and thats how I managed to wrap him around my finger.      Time moved on I said how I would like him to ***** me and how I had already thought about it without him there time moves on and we get closer and what do you know I tell him I love him - seeing I dont love that fearful husband of mine.      Thats when I stopped communicating with him ha ha ha ha, he tried a few times to get back into contact and I said I was busy lol obviously I wasnt but he didnt know that, its been several months now and the guy has made many efforts to contact me lol and I know the lapdog will be there when I finally get out of this nightmare of a marriage cos I can just whistle and call him by the petname I used which often made him c um.      Sure I've distanced myself from him not replied to anything hes sent but I feel guilty and have regrets about this all I of course used the line that I would never see his life rejected and sh!t.

20090205045827AAzxLM2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	At what age would you tell your child that the dad they have always known is not there biological dad?	When my child was a baby she was beaten by my now ex husband, i called police etc and he ran away, left the country and still never been found, when my child was one i met up with another man who i had known as a friend for 10 years already, our relationship developed and we are now married, my child knows only him as her daddy, she has no memories of her biological i have never spoken of him to her as there has been no need to, he has gone, and never been in touch since which suits me fine, my child is happy now with 2 loving parents, but when do i tell her about her biological, i know that one day i will have to, i would rather tell her myself that her finding out by accident  through documents like birth certificate etc, what age would be right to tell her though? i dont want to leave it too late but i want her to be mature enough to understand aswell, also my main question is  would you tell the truth and make her aware that her biological beat her and put her in hospital at only 5 months old? i dont think any child no matter how old they were could accept that.   I really don't know when or what to say without her feeling so unwanted by him, after all if i hadn't come home early and found him beating her he could have killed her as far as i see it. i dont want to go into too many details but put it this way, it was very very bad.   Thanks in advance for any replies.
20090205032341AA4X9wM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I divorced my husband but .....?	We'd been together 8 and a 1/2 years , raised 7 children 4 mine , 2 his , 1 our's aged from 7 up to 18 , a lot of drama followed our union his ex wife mother of his son used emotional blackmail to make him hate us , 2 of my sons turned to drugs and alcahol , all 3 boys ran away or moved away from us by their 13th birthdays leaving me with a hole in my heart and wondering about my parenting skills , all 3 boys told me it wasnt my fault 1 claimed I spoilt them to much with love and making sure their birthdays and christmas were happy , the 2nd claimed he just didnt want to be a part of our family or his mothers new family he wants to live with his friends , the oldest claims it wasnt my fault he just didnt want to be given rules .  my 13 year old suffers from ADHD , ODD ( Oppositional Defiance Disorder he can not tell between wrong and right ) and Asperger's , the other 3 children are happy enough and havent done anything to cause worry for us .      These 4 boy's have caused us a lot of grief but I have spent every waking moment trying to get them home with us my ex husband wants me to just let go and let them come home when they are ready , he lives day by day to get through the stress actually he hides his stress . We still live together we chose to stay together after the divorce and now I feel lost and like I am living in an alian planet he is happy we're divorced but still sleeping together and going day by day as husband wife and children . I am miserable I want my life back my husband , my kids but he has absolutely no intention of re-committing he cant even vocalise what our relationship is . We both put in financially and emotionally for the kids but he is more like a room mate with benefits then anything else its driving me insane .      I know it was insane to stay but he didnt want me to go and I didnt want to go why did I file for divorce ? Because I lost the man I loved emotionally and got a cold hearted man , he has been really trying to get back to that caring , sensitive , loving man I cant critisize his attempt's but I dont know what to do , I have explained to him my wishes and needs but it hasnt changed anything god why is this so hard ?      What's he thinking ? Why did he stay if he doesnt want to be committed ? .

20090205031144AA08ZGy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! I Can't Get A Guy Out Of My Head?	Well, I've known this guy since eighth grade (we're now in eleventh), and all year we argued and teased each other. We were also the top Girl and Guy in the class (grade wise) so we were always competing for grades. So I never really liked him much (unlike every girl in my class). But everyone always teased me about liking him      Over the years, hes had a couple of girlfriends. And he just broke up with a few weeks ago.       I never really thought about him much. Untill lately. And every 5 seconds he popped into my head.  And it's driving me crazy because I have no idea why! The thoughts range from stuff like opinions, his ex-girlfriends etc.       So my questions are:    Why do I keep thinking about him?    And how do I stop thinking about him?        Ohhh and he's my best friends cousin.       Thanks in advance!

20090205050628AAjkApl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife going through menopause?	We have been married for 29 years and have 2 grown kids (both married and living away from home) We have always had a very healthy and active sex life, we both love each other very much. We are soul mates......Last year my wife went thru the change and stopped having her period...she became very moody, and our sex life ceased.   When we do have sex, which is about once every three months, she says that it hurts her and makes faces and clinches her teeth during the act...(which is not a real turn-on if you know what I mean).  I have tried everything, ....from getting her to go to the Dr. for hormone thearpy, to using Liquid Beads to help with the vaganial dryness...I have been patient, caring, loving..but nothing seems to help.  I have tried talking to her about it, to see if there was something that I could do....We have tried jells of all kinds.  It is now going on 6 months since the last time we made love.  I am at my wits end, and very frustrated.  I am not old enough to put an end to my sex life.     Does anyone have any suggestions?   (and self abuse is not a suggestion!!!)

20090205032346AAgeOKk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell the truth to her husband?	I really havn't thought of it... but as times goes by it seems unfair to both of us... She is married to him liing all the time not living with him and screwing around with me... she has told me time and time again that she will divorce and be with me but has never done so... Every time Ipush her away she dose everything to not lose me but will not finish her marrige either and oftern goes off with her husband... and then runs after me again... This has been going on for three years and she obviously dosn't care for either of us really as she is just using both... Or is she? I am just as much to blame but when I fell in love I was clear to her that I want to be with her... more and more lies is all I got as she continued to have her fun... Like everything is a game and no one has feelings... and this continues till today... Should I have a conversation with the husband... let him know what she has been telling me because I can understand some one being confused but its obvious after three years that she just wants to play with us both... Or am I wrong... She sleeps in my bed daily and yet no change has every come... Is this something that some one has the right to do? Play with peoples lives at any cost? I don't know aht the right thinh to do is but I dislike what she is doing and it seems unfair to both of us as she has her fun... enjoying the best from both sides and liing to both of us forever... What the hell man?

20090205022439AALmDyY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should my friend be mad and/or upset?	Ok last week was my best friend's 14th birthday and I went over to her house that night and we had a mini party with just the two of us. Anyway, she showed me all her presents. One of her presents was a brand new iPod nano. I thought it was really cool and because I family is poor I got a bit jealous too because her family could afford to get one for her.      Ok so she went to have a shower and said I could just look around in her room and look at her stuff. So she went to go have a shower and I felt so tempted to touch the iPod nano. I thought it was really innocent and not bad at all. I turned it on and played some poker card game for 5 minutes while she was in the shower. When she came back we went for a walk and then I went home.      Then when I next checked my message on my cell, there was one from her saying, "Did you like the poker game on my iPod?". I could tell she was mad at me because I touched it. I didn't think it was a big deal though. On Monday she actually said something about it. She said, "Why did you touch my iPod?". So I said, "I didn't really do anything to it to break it. I just looked around.." Then she went all weird the rest of the day and had a cruddy attitude.      Does she have the right to be mad and/or upset?      Is she upset maybe because I touched her brand new iPod?      Please help?
20090205025442AA4Y4Re	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this guy likes me? 10 Points.?	Sorry this is long!!!      In music today we were playing some purcussion peice and everyone had to pick an intrument from the boxes. I picked percussion sticks because they are really loud and I love loud sounds!   Here are percussion sticks if you didn't know what they are.  http://www.magictails.com/abydos/images/...       So anyway, I sat in the back row with my best friends Penny and Dara. They had maracas and I had the percusion sticks. These two guys Ben and Cory were sitting in front of us. They both had percussion sticks. Ben, Cory and me were the only ones in the class with percussion sticks.       So when we had to practice, I had to go outside with them, just us three. Cory kept hitting me playfully with his sticks and when I stuffed up he would say, "Aww.. Jess!!" in a playful voice.      When we went back to the classroom the play the percussion peice, we sat in the seats we had when we first came in and I kept messing it up and he would playfully hit me with the sticks and laugh. The whole time the teacher would yell at me for tapping them when I wasn't supposed to and Cory kept saying, "It was Jess, it was ALL Jess!" and he looked at me and smiled playfully.      When we put them away he bumped into me dilberatly and smiled.       Then when the bell rang and we left the classroom he pushed me into the girl in front of me and laughed and said, "Jess!

20090205031128AAywc5V	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Uncomfortable around my husband's friend?	My husband has a best friend of more than 20 years.  He often talks about how bad his marriage is, and how his wife no longer has sex with him.  He showed up a few days ago and started talking again about his sex life in his marriage, and reminiscing about his past sexual adventures.  I heard in great detail about how he had orgies, underage partners, had competitions with friends to deflower virgins with beer prizes, and more.  He finally left at two in the morning, and my husband told me how when they had gone to the supermarket to pick up icecream, this guy had insisted they go down a certain aisle to follow a gorgeous looking blonde woman around the supermarket so he could drool over her.  I know my husband did not lead the same lifestyle as this guy when they were younger - in fact, this so-called friend was quite rude about how inexperienced in comparison my husband was.  Anyway, I feel uncomfortable around this guy, and I don't want him to be a part of our lives anymore, especially as we have two daughters.  However, my husband has known this man since they were in their early teens, and wants to continue the friendship, despite disapproving of his friends morals.  Any thoughts?
20090205034213AArFeKL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Best wedding disaster story...?	I worked in wedding stationery design for a while, and the best wedding disaster story a client told me was that they had bowls of live goldfish on each table as a centrepiece, and they had planned to give them away to the children at the wedding, but the guests got drunk, and started doing shots with the goldfish in them, and there were only a few left at the end of the night.        At my own wedding, my mother had decided to alter my dress a little as I'd lost weight.  Unfortunately she did it the night before, without me being there, and it was too tight when I tried it on.  We wound up safety pinning roses down the back of the dress to cover the gap.  Any other disasters out there?

20090205025537AAeKJEO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I jealous with my girlfriend?	Well I guess Im very protective of her, but last night she was talking to one of my best friends on MSN and she was telling me that they were having a fun conversation. And today I look at her name and she has put him in her personal message (she has other boys there too). Shes not doing anything wrong I know that and Im sorry for feeling like this but I cant help wanting her to myself. And also she is the jealous type too, because I was talking to a girl last night and she mentioned it to me in a sarcastic way - plus also she doesnt like it when I talk to girls anyway. So how can I calm myself down? I dont want to presume things but it really worries me, I know she'd never be unfaithful. Help?

20090205021221AAhwZag	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does this girl have so much hatred in her?	So, there's this girl in 4th yr (I'm in 3rd yr) who I found out really really hates me.       I've known her since I was in grade 6, so that's about 8-9 years or so, and I can reassure you that there were no fights between us within that time period, since we were never close at all. And also we were in separate schools for at least 5 of those years.      Now all of a sudden, I hear that she's been bad-mouthing me in her student council meetings and just under her own breath to people who don't know me or people who are my friends.       Should I be afraid that her hatred is going to spread like some incurable cancer to people I know (and don't know possibly)?       Or should I rely on the fact that we are all mostly (aside from this girl) 20+ year old students who should have the maturity to not let ridiculous prejudices and assumptions of character overtake us?       Should I be doing anything? (ie: confrontation) Or should I just do what I was always doing? Which is to go about my day and trust my friends will look down at her random vices against me, and remain unmoved by her judgments.      ***Big philosophical question here: Why do people hate other people?       I befriend those who let me, and I love as they would love me. I don't understand hatred. =(

What would you do if she was a dearest friend of yours who is planning to marry some other guy of 37 with an age difference of 10 years? She is a very sweet girl with over- positive attitude.

I think it's kind of an addiction, so I don't want to give him anything about computer.      He doesn't really do much other than being on the computer for about one year now. It's really hard to find a good gift because he kind of lost interest in everything.      Is there any present that would get him motivated and interested to do things again?

Im going to spare you the details but me and my girlfriend of 8 months just broke up for the first and probley only time. She is the only girl I have ever loved and I have been with alot of girls. Im still whipping away the tears.       She broke up with me because I made fun of her about something, im not going to get into what it is, but we got into a huge argument over the phone and she ended up cutting her rists, she even sent me the pics. Im 24 so please don't tell me I will find someone else because I wont and I wont look. If I don't get back with her I don't want to be with anyone. I give you my word on that.

20090205025704AABtfIF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need serious help please........................…	what do we do? i've been with my bf for half a year. his parents found out about us and they are really mad because we aren't the same race. they aren't the usual disapproval parents who merely complain that you can just ignore. if we don't stop dating they're gonna kick him out of the family. and that means they will cut off his allowance and his school tuition and also make him move out. now, well can't ever going to finish college if he can't get any money (scholarship is too hard to get here, he actually applied a year ago, nothing came out of it). and the only jobs that will take high school grads with no experience are very low pay with almost no chances of promotion. as for living right now he can stay with other friends or with me (if my parents agree since our home is extremely small with very little extra space, but they are very understanding people, unlike my bf's parents) anyway i guess we could go at it alone but it will be so hard. but another thing is, do we really want to do it? i'm not totally sure myself. he wants to but i'm sceptical besides we've only been together for half a year who knows what will become of our relationship in the future? i surely hope we will be together and it will be worth this hardship. besides for both of us it's our first, we never dated anyone else in our life. well this is so hard to figure out what to do i am so confused. sorry i rambled on but you get the point i hope. and please help thanks so much.
20090205035530AACOLTC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How much can I really expect of him?	A long while ago, I met my dream guy. Everything about him is wonderful. We've been dating and things have gotten very serious. We're thinking seriously about marriage in the future, but there is something that stands in the way.      Several years ago I started suffering from a mysterious illness that seriously detracts from the quality of my life. I am often confined to bed, unable to wake up and perform daily responsibilities, overwhelmed with pain, distracted, and restless. He has been extremely supportive of me and done his best to help me cope, but unfortunately there is not much he, or anyone, can really do. It's gotten much worse over the past several months. It has infiltrated every part of my life, including my relationship with him.       I try to do my best to give him what he needs, but it is becoming increasingly difficult. I often have to tell him to give me space because I can't breath, back off because I'm in pain, or to be patient because I'm exhausted. It's gotten to a point now where he can't even touch me softly because the tissue under my skin hurts so bad. For as much as it hurts me, I know it's killing him.       He often gets justifiably frustrated with me because I overslept  or am moving slow or I'm not allowing him to be physically affectionate. He knows its because of the illness and then he gets frustrated at the fact that he feels like he can't get frustrated with me because I have no control over it. We've gone to several doctors over the past couple months and it looks like we're starting to figure things out, but it's still extremely difficult for him right now.       Sometimes I hate myself for doing this to him. When I'm the only one experiencing this pain I can handle it, but when it starts affecting him I just can't. I love him desperately and I know he feels the same, but I wonder how long his iron-clad patience can hold out.       So I ask the question, how much is it fair of me to expect from him? How can I help him cope with my illness? What can I do to make his life easier? Do I just have to accept that it's not fair for him to stay with me? How can I still love him and put him through this?       Please, any help will be appreciated.

20090205030138AAaz0f5	Family & Relationships;Friends	If you were in this situation, Would you talk to her?	Where do i start.. i was friends with this girl when i first started highschool, and over the years we became best frends.. we went out everywhere together, and we were best frends that were always with eachother.. we even went on holidays together. Last year, this suddenly changed.. she also had a boyfriend, and we were still close but it seemed like we were drifting apart.. she was barely coming to school because she was sick for a bit, and then she stopped coming to school completely.. i was really concerned about her and i tried calling her and messaging her all the time but no reply and no answer. this went on for about 4 months. then all of a sudden she started speaking to me again and said she was going through a hard time and thats why she hadnt been talking to me or anything. i said to her that she should start making an effort with me or else i would never talk to her again. soon after that she didnt make any effort again and we didnt talk for another 2 or so months. and then this year she got in contact with me again, and her boyfriend had broken up with her. i was really angry about that because it seemed to me like, now she dosent have anyone and comes back to her old friends. She kept emailing me for over a month, and told me how sorry she was, and that he controlled her and didnt want her talking to me and so on. She also said she was depressed and stuff like that. I was still a bit angry and upset because she did leave school without any reasons why or anything like that. The other night she told me she was coming back to school the day after. I was shocked because i thought she was left for good, and i had gotten comfortable being around other people, even though i had always hung out with her while she was at school. And yeah, She came back the day after, and she got allocated to the locker next to me.. it was really awkward because we were best frends and that had completely changed. I haven't even talked to her as shes been back at school.. I've said hello once or so, but i haven't made the effort to talk to her. I've seen her around school and shes been alone, and i know that it must be hard for her to come back since she hasnt been there for about 9 months. But i'm still really angry about what she did to me, but i don't know if im being too hard on her.. or whether i should talk to her, because as far as i know you dont do that to "best frends"   Opinions?

I liked him immediately and he did tell me he was just looking for fun. We just hang out and watch movies and he has never taken me out on a date. I thought maybe we would grow closer by hanging out more. He used to text me alot and we would hang out at least once or twice a week. We haven't seen each other in like a month and sometimes he doesn't reply to my texts. I confronted him and he got all defensive saying he's done nothing wrong and to stop accusing him of lying. I just asked why he doesn't always respond to my text and he said his phone has been messed up. Also, he said he's just been really busy working and he cant control everything. Is this guy lying or could he be telling the truth? Don't you think he would want to spend more time with me and not less?

I keep thinking about her, is this because I have no other female on the horizon? I do really like this girl, she's not "the one" but I do really like her. I think she's just settled for second best in getting back with her ex for the third time.      Please do help me.

20090205032105AAqVTL6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think he just doesn't really want to be here..what do you think?	My husband and I constantly argue. Sometimes not sleeping in the same bed. For example, I came home from work last night. He was playing video games and still had our two boys awake. He did give them a bath and did homework with our 7 yr old boy(our other boy is 3) but it was past 10pm and they were still up. He didn't even look up from what he was doing to ask how my day was doing. I proceeded to tell the boys that its way past their bedtime and they need to go to bed. I was a little upset at my husband for having them up, I didn't yell and scream but just told him that we have to get them to bed and clean up. I asked him to bring their clothes downstairs. We began to argue and he like always tried to turn it on me by saying that he's tired of me telling him what to do, and how he doesn't want to live like this and how bad I am. By the way he had a toothache, but I didn't think I deserve this. I think he's just trying to distract from the fact that he just does'nt was'nt want to be where he is and doesn't have the balls to admit it or to leave. We go through this type of thing all the time, it gets worse during the time he's trying to stop smoking. What do you think? I think he just doesn't love me and has' nt got the guts to leave. We've been married for 8 yrs, but together for 11 yrs.
20090205032314AAfpWjQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This guy is confusing me...help?	I met this guy at my new work place. Earlier he seemed to be very interested in being near me most of the time. Trying to touch my hands, finding excuses to be near me all the time etc etc.   We exchanged numbers & started speaking for about a month. I never called him much telling him I didnt know what he was doing and that I didnt want to disturb him. He would say that I could ring him any time. He would mention "dont you see I am flirting with you", " I want to take you out on a date- just you and me"(although that never happened). He invited me and other office pals for his birthday treat. He quietly messaged me that I was looking very sweet. Everything seemed like such a fairy tale because I felt i was falling for him and he seemed to like me too.   He made me meet one of his best pals. We went out for another dinner outing. Him , myself and one of his friend. That night I wasnt feeling well and he held my hands for quiet a long time. This made me feel that he likes me for sure.   Few more weeks and suddenly he is moody at work, his calls have stopped. He used to say he will call up and then the day would end and no calls from him. Even if I called him casually, he would answer as if I committed a crime by calling him up. So i stopped calling him. I took it as he isnt interested in me anymore.   He got to know from a colleague that I wanted to go out for dinner on new years. He rang me and asked if I would like to go out with him and the colleague. I said it was fine with me. But the whole evening he kept asking "when are you getting married...you are growing old...high time you got married". It pissed me off to some extent but I didnt say a thing. He wasnt well that night so the next day being an off I called up to know about his health. He sounded pissed and we hardly spoke for 2 minutes...that was the end of it...I didnot call him up again.    We didnt speak much at work too.   But now recently, hes started being around me again at work. Touching me, teasing me, asking me out with colleagues and all, behaving like old times but no calls yet. I dont get it....what does this guy want...is he interested in me the way I am ?    I cant ask this to him directly since I dont want it to get embarassing later on.   What do you guys think?

20090205032651AAUz2Uf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	27 years between husband and me, am 41 him 68, wills suddenly an issue, wants me to leave home when he dies?	Thanks for all your answers to my previous question - just to provide a bit more info. I have been with my husband since age 21, we maried when I was 30, now 41. I had my own house, which I paid my own mortgage on and saved 9 years rent to a joint account. I  then sold my house and the proceeds and my savings went into buying our house now of 6 years. The balance of proceeds came from the sale of my husbands house. All have always been in joint names - the balance of funds from my husbands house is in a joint bank account, but he is adamant that is all his. The will issue started 2 years ago when his x tried to convince him his obligation was to his daughter of similar age to me and his 2 grandchildren and not to me. The home is a beautiful country property my dream. Now he is trying to leave me just 1/2 when he dies - and force me to sell it.

20090205032936AAkIuNJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Dealing with an emotional affair?	My wife has just recently revealed to me that for this past year she has been having an emotional affair with her ex boyfriend. She is very distraught and can hardly live with herself knowing the pain she has caused.   This affair was not an attempt to replace something missing from our marriage, I have always treated her like a queen.   My wife and her ex hadn't talked, or even seen each other in 9 years.   I was aware that this reconnect had started about a year ago, she wanted to be respectful to me and told me that they were just two friends seeking closure.   I did not mind that they were talking, I truely feel that you can not abandon your past. I even offered to get together with his wife so that we can support their friendship.   They eventually revealed to each other that they still had strong feelings and he confided in her about his own failing marriage.   This is where the secrets begain and my wife started to pull away from me, our marriage and our son.   I accidentally found a text message from him that was not appropriate and even though I know it was wrong I scrolled down to verify that it wasn't the only one.   I came home and talked to my wife about this explaining that I found the message by accident, but that I did invade her privacy after the fact to confirm it was indeed an issue.   She was clearly upset at the fact her privacy was invaded and was really defensive. She did assure me that that form of message would never happen again and I took her on her word.   This all happened in April, the recconect with her ex was a year ago this past December and she finally excepted the fact that she has all but abandoned our relationship and our 2 year old son.   I believe her when she says that she wants this to work out and to prove this she has cut all ties with her ex.   I love my wife more than she will ever know and I hate to have this affect my poor helpless son who never did anything to deserve this horor show.   Am I a fool for wanting to repair what was lost, can it ever be the same, or should I stop listening to my heart and walk away from the best thing that has ever happened to me?

20090205033145AA5DEvI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How unusual/bad is it to be rejected by a prostitute?	I've never had a girlfriend and never had a prostitute and now I'm rejected by one.      Serious answers please by people with experience in this. I do not condone illegal activity if this is illegal in your region/country.     More info:       * I am from a western country and of that ethnicity (white), she is eastern european.     * We met, she brought me up to her apartment and then said "sorry about that" and closed the door. =(      * I called the next day and the person on the phone knew it was the person she rejected that was calling and said to come in that day no problem. (so I doubt it'd be a normal thing for her) However a few minutes later I got a text back saying no, she didn't want me. =(     * I am not too young or too old. Not too short or to tall. Not too fat or too thin.     * I have what I would call quite poor skin (acne, redness, really not smooth skin). However I went to a dermatogologist and she only said it was like a 3/10 or 4/10, that it wasn't too bad at all. I don't know though... that rating is for the acne and my skin appears a bit red to me. Also I got flushed in the lift because of the warmness of it.    * My head and stuff are the right size, however my lips are VERY weird. They're thick and are sort of like a blob. This girl is supposed to be great at GFE (girlfriend experience).... but I didn't want that cause it would be weird for me as well. They actually look grand if you're two metres or more away. I used to tell myself they only look that bad because you don't regularly get to see faces up close.... nawww....     * As we were walking to her apartment (I love the way she walks, you should see it, it really is something...), she kept turning her head right around 180 degrees and looking straight at me. The fact she was able to do this so naturally shows how flexible she is. Later I realised she was probably thinking: "I can't have sex with THIS!!!". =(    * I avoided eye contact with her a good bit (not when she looked back at me though). I also answered her when she said "are you okay?" in the elevator a bit nervously. This is what I'm like all the time though, especially with an attractive woman alone in an elevator. And it was to let her know I wouldn't want GFE etc. as well. Maybe she got the sense I was a psychopath or something, but her friend was the exact, exact opposite. And I doubt it, we don't get murders or anything like that in my country and especially my part of the country (in fact she tours to a different, far more dangerous part of the country). Please don't give this as the main reason why she would because I am extremely timid and non-aggressive and it's just too much of a cop-out I feel.     * I could get a tiny bit of a smell off of me. This was because I had to walk a long distance in the rain! I wasn't dressed very well, but I had what I consider to be a nice coat and I didn't think it would matter (although in future I'll dress better).      * Her friend tried her best to set us up again just to meet and talk, she was a really nice girl because she didn't have to do that and text me back at all. But the girl I was supposed to meet wouldn't even open the door to her apartment complex the second time. =(     * I kept asking the reason why by text. The first thing she got her friend to text back was "a strange feeling" and her friend also texted me saying "I don't know why my friend don't like you". I wish I knew why, and no matter how much I begged she wouldn't consider meeting again. =(
20090205033303AAHTZFi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is sex out of lust healthy in marriage?	Ok I am currently working second shift for a couple of weeks. My wife is asleep when I get home most of the time. Last night I came in and was being quiet not to wake her. I climbed in the bed, and she was wearing cute shorts and I could see the bottom of her butt cheeks. I was overcome by lust. I just kind of climbed on top of her and kissed her head and asked her if she mind if I released some sexual tension. She barely woke up and was not really into it.   I had a powerful orgasm but the sex was just out of lust. Is this healthy in a marriage? Its just hard to do all the foreplay and romantic stuff with our crazy work schedule.
20090205033520AAwbTUs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She avoids eye contact but smiles and keeps in touch?	We work in the same office.  From the very first moment, I was sure we were attracted to each other, but her behavior has me confused.  In the office, she avoids eye contact and avoids talking to me but she smiles intriguingly when our paths cross.  Once we are out of the office, however, she sometimes sends innocuous text messages or inspirational quotes about life and relationships.  I am unable to fathom whats going on in her mind.

20090205033943AAbStJ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for girls???????	ok... theres this girl I meet every friday when a bus comes and takes me skiing (she's very attractive) soooo based on who I am (a very serious guy for my age) such girls that hang out with cool (funny) guys often don't get attracted to me very much. but suddenley a friend of mine (who is a friend of hers) tells me that she likes me and has told him to speak with me and give her number to me.... so here I am right now with her number in front of me, supposed to text her by the evening... and... I have no idea what to say cause she didn't really look like she wanted me to be her boyfriend while I was talking to her, and because of thet I didn't talk to her all that much. so here are my questions:   1. What am I going to tell her in my text message?   2. What would you do if you were intrested in a guy?    and btw she doesn't know that my friend has told me that she likes me cause he wasn't supposed to talk to me about her straight forward!

20090205034442AAw8tDz	Family & Relationships;Family	Daughter′s share in father′s property?	My father left a will before his death in 1987where he clearly stated that all his 3 children should share his (self-acquired) property equally only after the death of his wife. My mother died some years ago and did not make any will. We are 2 sisters and 1 brother who would legally be the heirs of the property left by our parents. Our brother destroyed father′s will and is not willing to execute the division of the property legally and mentally harassing us. One sister has been residing in the said property from the time of her marriage when our father was still alive. Our brother who is also living in that house in another floor is all the time harassing us and threatening that he will see that the sisters will not get anything. We have waited already 5 years thinking that we can settle the issue amicably because we sisters care about the family honor. I would be very thankful if someone who faced a similar problem can advise us what we can do to stop our brother doing any manipulations. Can we also file a case against our alcoholic brother who has become a threat to the family members?

20090205034945AAYIUPZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend dumped me, tried getting her back, never worked. Is it my fault?	Got a little drunk one night and she dumped me, would not talk to me.  It was the first time she saw me drunk. I felt it was not a big thing that i did wrong, was very pissed off and i sent her a nasy text after she dumped me. I walked out of my job and i went away for christmas, because i was so upset. When i got back i tried to get her back, and she said she felt nothing and her family dont approve. I sent flowers saying sorry to her work place. She met me and we slept in a hotel together, said she wanted to meet up a few times to see. When the day came she got cold feet, but i persuaded her to come. Went for a drink and she was very off saying her mum and aunt dont approve us getting back together. She was then telling me she is going ibiza in july with her friends and that a guy likes her at work. Told me she would never go with someone from work though, cant understand why she is saying all this to me. Her mum said to her that she can do better than me. As she was telling me all this i just kept drinking and drinking. She then had a pissed off look said i was getting drunk. Next day she text me saying in her hearts of hearts its not what she wants and she is sorry. I feel so upset and angry at the same time. Really pissed off that she is dumping me over stupid things, and that her mum is saying all those things to her.  The mum would say to her that we are so different when we were going out, then my ex would say to me maybe we are too different.  The mum and my ex live alone together, and my ex dont know her father, the mum dumped him and he went away. The mum is very fussy with men and has been single for years.  I even said i was sorry though i never thought it was that bad of a thing the first time i got drunk. A month before it all happened we were arguing over something silly and she threatened to walk out, which was not a big thing too, then i sat her down and she told me that there was things she wanted to change about me, saying i'm laid back and there is no get up and go with me.  I did think after that she was looking to dump me.  When i met her the second time after she had dumped me she said it was because of that night i was drunk, not what she said before, and she did nothing wrong and it is my fault.  Told me that i want to be with her more then she wants to be with me.  I feel its all my fault, i really love her still, know were never getting back.  Im 24 and she was my first love.  I dont think i will love anyone again. She was very good looking, and she looked very sweet and innocent looking, looked like the girl of my dreams. Feel i wont meet anyone again.  What shall i do?
20090205035249AAzvgYm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help! I cant take this and I don't know what to do?	I have feelings for my best friend but I want to stop liking him. He's too confusing and its starting to hurt my feelings. He knows I like him for a long time now.      1)He said he wouldn't make it awkward but He's making it awkward.      2) He just randomly started paying to attention to my friends more than me (He would say hi but then talk to them the whole time) It makes me feel pathetic.      3) Its like he's making me closer to a guy who confessed his feelings for me, Its as if he wants me to be with him.      4) We communicate more (hang out and talk over the phone) but he leaves right away.      But       1) He told me he has some feelings for me and its growing   2) He protected me from a random guy who kept on following me home.   3) He asked me to wait for him since he's not used to liking a girl this way.      Please help!..Its just he was so sweet and nice when he didn't know who I liked when I told him he changed.      Should I wait or should I try and get over him?    Please tell me how to get over him if you choose the 2nd one.      We're both juniors and have many classes together.

20090205035452AAXhgb3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just broke up with my boyfriend?	I feel really strange. About a week ago i put a question on here asking what to about my boyfriend ( you should go onto my profile and check it out if you want to see the details). Basically short story, it was long distance after a year of him being with me then he went to Uni and since he went to Uni he ignored me and treated me like rubbish. He didn't respect me and this kept on going for 6 months. So last night i made the painful decision that i would break up with him today. Which i did. But he didn't even try and get back with me. He just said Umm ok and yeah you are right. he didn't comment on my saying how much of an idiot he was towards me. Why didn't he? Why didn't he say sorry?      Anyway the weird thing is, when he has dumped me twice i have been crying all the time but now im not. I feel like i shouldn't waste anymore tears on him. But should i feel that way? Should i be crying? I have made the right decision, he was terrible to me. We were together for a year and 4 months ( tmw woudl have been a year and 5 months). I dont really know what im asking for answer wise. Have any of you felt this way when you have broken up with someone? i still love him but i know he doesnt love me anymore, not like he used to. The relationship was pointless towards the end, he hardly ever talked to me. Thanks for reading this. I gues si just needed to get it out of my system. Reassurance woudl be wonderful.

20090205044110AAdphSt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have met a man from an international website and he would like to marry me!  Is he genuine?	Since May-08 I have been corresponding and talking on the phone to an Indian from a dating website, he resides in India.  I live in New Zealand.  He wants to come here to New Zealand to marry me and start a family of our own.  He has a daughter, seems lovely and genuine, it is hard to tell online though:   1) He wants to come to NZ on a tourist visa for up to 90 days and then marry me once we have known each other for up to 45 days.   2) He said it will cost a lot of money for him to come and if I turned him down I guess there would be a lot of heartache for both of us.   3) He comes from the state of Punjab.  Some of my friends say there are people who say anything to get citizenship into another country.   4) He does not have any qualifications and is willing to work hard.   5) We are of completely different cultures.  I have not had much luck with those in my own culture, so I thought why not try a different culture.  We think a lot the same, however I do know there would be some hurdles with a European and Indian getting together.  We have the same values and both have very strong family ties.  He says his family approves of our marriage.   My gut tells me he is genuine, I am unsure if I am making a mistake.  Can anyone help me.

20090412114739AAuqJRZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it really over? Do we still have a chance? What should I do? (shortened version)?	Sorry this is my first time doing this......      Ok long story short: I've been in a long distance relationship for a year and a half. 3 weeks ago I went for a surprise visit on my girlfriend's sons's bday. She didn't know I was coming and was forced to tell me she was seeing someone else for the last 30 days or so when I got there. She is bi polar and hasn't been taking her meds for a few months. I know her being bi polar isn't an excuse but I do belive that her not taking her meds may have lead to her making the choice she made without regard for the potential consequences. I've supported her finacially so she really depended on me for pretty much everything. That's why it makes sense to me about her meds.      I still don't know where her head and more importantly her heart is at. But I also don't think its a good time to pressure her for these answers because she is not in her normal state of mind. I still love her and want to work through this but not if she doesn't love me anymore. What should I do? How should I approach this? I need a different prespective or different way of looking at this whole situation. Any advice or suggesstions are greatly appreciated. Thanks.

20090204150953AAfL2Q7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've always been respectful to him, but he doesn't respect me at all?	We agreed to only see each other only as **** buddies... its been a year and a half... He was treating me like a friend at the beginning, very caring, were having lots of fun together. With time, he begun to disprespect me a lot. After a year and a half now its being ridiculous. He lost total respect 4 me lughing in my back and stuff... But when he wants me, hes acting like very possessive, like "ure mine" and if I dont wana spend the nite he freaks out and needs to cuddle all nite. He is very insecure... Now ITS OVER, I don't want him in my life anymore, but Im just wondering if its me... AM I the problem or hes just a stupid jerk who doesnt have any respect for anybody cuz he doesnt even respects himself... How can I gain my respect back?
20090204150853AAISD2T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should my next step be?	Okay so, I'm kind of new to the whole dating thing, since a license is kind of needed for it. I've had girlfriends before, but I'm talking about the more mature form of dating, where you actually get to know the person you want a relationship with, before you make it 'official'.       I just got my license, and I took this girl I've liked for quite some time out on a pretty big date, that involved an hour drive there and back.      On the way there, she was very talkative, and we seemed to get along great. We got into the place, gave them our tickets, I paid for our drinks, and we continued to get along throughout the night.      Then, on the ride home, her mood suddenly shifted completely. She was suddenly very quiet, and I couldn't tell if she was suddenly shy, or angry with me for something I did, or did not do. I tried a few times to get us talking like we did on the way there, but all attempts crashed and burned. I couldn't help but get frustrated and angry, so I gave up.      I dropped her off at her house, and then went home. I got a text from a friend, asking for me to get on AOL Instant Messenger when I got back, so I did. After logging on, I noticed the girl I had just taken out was online.         Here is where I screwed up.       I sent her an IM, and asked for another date...sort of. I appologized for the fact, that we didn't get a chance to eat before the show (we got caught in traffic) and I told her I would have to make it up to her and take her out to dinner sometime.      She didn't say yes, or no. She said 'lol'. At first, I took it as her not giving me an answer, but then I realised I didn't even ask her out. I made a statement, and she didn't know how to respond. I guess it depends on the point of view you look at it...      Ever since the date, we went from talking every chance we got for hours, to an unspoken awkwardness. We barely talk at all now.         So, what should my next course of action be? I want to take her out on another date and some how fix this mess I've inadvertently created, but I don't know if I already blew my chances by jumping the gun.       Should I ask her out on a second date, or just move on?

20090204185831AA9wdXz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEEASE HELP ME. I BEG OF YOU.?	14/F    OK, so this might be a little long, but I'm not too sure.  Most of you are probably gunna get too lazy and NOT READ IT.  But thats OK, I don't want your lazy a** answer anyways.    Oh and most of you will probably think this is petty and stupid, but to me, it means the world.    This question is about me and my boyfriend, Jackson.    First of all, i'll give you a bit of of me and Jacksons history.    He is my first boyfriend and my first kiss and my first date.     He asked me out about a year and a half ago and I had been crushing on him for a while before that, so I said yes.    However, he went to a different school before and so we would always either talk on the phone or on the Internet.    But, we would always talk consistently and a LOT.  We would ALWAYS do something every weekend and we'd have a whole bunch of fun.    He was most possible the sweetest guy I had ever met.  But..    some people would tell me that he liked this other girl, Sarah,  which would make me question him,  but in the end, he was always so sweet to me that it just couldn't be true.    Now, we go to the same school.  We've now been going out for a year and a half.    We. Never. Talk.  We're in the 8th grade.  Everyone else and their boyfriends are always flirting and talking all day long,  But he's always with his tenth grade "friends", and to be honest, sometimes I just get so bothered with him that I just really honestly don't wanna talk to him.    Also, I have a "friend," Michelle.   She is kinda messed up, and she's had a lot of bad stuff happen to her.    And it just so happens, he hasn't had it so easy either.    SO they get along REAALLY well. Too well.  They go to each others houses, and they text 24/7.    They tell each other EVERYTHING.  When I try to talk to him about it, he just laughs and says something cheesy like "are you joking? your're the only one i could EVER like."  and blah blah blah.    And today after school, my best friend, Jackson and I were standing outside and my best friend asked him "would you go out with Michelle?"  and he looked really nervous and said "I'm not really sure.."  And I don't know why, but I get so jealous so easily.    but it's kind of embarassing to me, because every one else notices it too.   Not like I care that people notice, cuz I really don't care what they think, but it just kinda gets to me sometimes.    And so today, I just had it.  I pulled him aside and was ready to breakup with him.    But then he went and did his stupid smile and sweet talked.    He really does care about me so much and always helps me and looks out for me. He always overlooks my flaws and I really honestly don't think he'd care if I was a slob or stupid or ugly.     He would never do anything to hurt me, but what he doesn't know is that he's hurting me everyday. I've never met anyone like him before.    Whenever I try to break up with him, something stops me.    Sometimes, he's all I've got.  When my friends are total bi****s, he's always there to talk.    Part of me knows that it's just not working.    but I also know that I love him more than anything.  He's the first person I've ever loved.    I really can't go on like this.    THE END.    oh, and thank you SO much if you actually read that whole thing ;)  I really appreciate it.    None of my friends can help me, or maybe just don't mare enough to help me,  so i've gone to the desperate measure of asking complete anonymous stangers. =P    What should I do? :$    Thank you SOO MUCH

20090204171106AAiAC9b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he being so distant? Help!?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 months, and we've known each other for seven years. He normally doesn't keep things from me, I've always been one of the few (and by few I mean 2 or three) people he can talk to.. but I can't help but have a weird feeling about this.       The past couple times we've hung out have been pretty bland. He wasn't very talkative. We've barely spoken in the past week, aside from the occasional "hi" via IM or text. From what I'm told, he has basically just been working and sleeping - but that's coming from him. He DOES sometimes sleep a lot, but not for 24 hours.       I think putting an emphasis on his struggles with clinical depression might be important, but honestly, I'm coming up with any excuse to make myself think something other than "is he cheating on me?"   Basically, I'm worried that he's either cheating on me or it's a health-related issue. Any input?

20090204172250AA3Hyf8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a shy girl, i cant tell what all this means HELP!!!?	the girl i like who i have asked her to hang out, yes strictly hang out, i didnt use the word date or anything. i just asked for her to hang out which to me, its a date, anywho, she was busy the first 2 with her sport and then her family wedding up north the two times i tried. the third time was a month later and she said she didnt know.. she was telling me how shy/boring she is and wasnt feeling herself, she stated we could hang out at the end of the conversation but just not now.      1 moment later she returns to me and starts appologizing to me saying it sounded really rude as if she DIDNT like me, (i assume thats a sign?) she said she is just tired latley and she said when shes going out of the house she will definatley let me know.      i always look at that as a good sign.      there is just one small problem, she is so shy and so emotionally kept in, (not emo) just shy and has 1 good friend who she hangs out with during school. the other times she is usually home. i.e i cant read her signs and she rarely initiates anything with anyone.. when italk to her tho she listens and keeps the conversation going and when i walk to class i see her look in my direction to see if im their, (my usual route) and when she sees me she waits.      i just need to know if i should confront her now... and ask for clarification or just ask her out normally.. or even wait a few weeks until trying again..      i mean ive seen signs i think, that conversation i wrote being 1 of them, but than this week she seemed non talkative, i know she not talkative in the first place but this time seemed a little bit less.. i dont know. if i could just have assurance or her telling me shes interested i would wait for along time, thats how much i care.

20090204155257AASUNaH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have loved this guy for a long time.....?	but he has a gf. They've been going out for about 1 week or so, but they've been breaking up and getting back together for about 2 years now. Everyone in our grade says he doesn't really like her. I've liked him since kindergarten, and when I was younger he used to like me. He always stares at me mysteriously and will stare at my chest area obsessionally (at least I think my chest). He also e-mails me regularly. One time I told him I'm kinda weird and he's like, "no your not." He's really sporty, one time I beat him in 100 meter dash, and he smiled at me and said "dang!". I'm kinda sporty, I do track, year-round soccer, and volleyball.    I just want to know if you think he doesn't like the other girl, and he kinda likes me.....
20090204194040AAEkN6l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it a good sign if a girl gives you her number without you even asking?	Because this older girl did that and she seems way out of my league. She is so pretty and older and could have any guy she wanted but she gave me her number and said we should go to a club. But I'm not 21 yet so I'm so confused about this whole thing. I don't know if I should ask her out or not, this seems like it's not even real, I don't know what to do. Does she even like me?

As an example, my bf got home from work at 6am and crawled into bed with me. I woke and started kissing his stomach and just trying to please him while he relaxed and he says to stop and that he's too tired. This kinda hurts because laying there doesn't take much energy... any ideas on what I can do to better please him when he's tired, or should I just not bother him when he is tired after work?
20090204171524AALDfLm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like her! What should I do?	I really like this girl. We used to talk online almost everyday but now we only talk once in a while. She's great. She's the prettiest person that I have ever seen. I really want to go out with her. I have liked her for the last year. When I started to like her, her friends asked me if I liked her, but the girl I like told me it didn't mean a thing. I can't give up on my feelings, I already tried but couldn't.    Do you think when her friends asked me if I liked her it did mean something?    I can't wait, she's on my mind all day long every single day    How do I tell her? I have no idea how to do it, I'm way too nervous and shy to tell her how I feel. I'm never alone with her at school. I never hang out with her outside of school. I think she may know because it used to be really obvious that I like her, but now we barely talk. What should I do?    HELP!

20090204190017AAMJwuK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I made a mistake, what should I do?	I tried to post this question earlier, but ran out of time so I had to quit. So, let me give you a short version of it:   Girl, lets call her B, (neighbor, known her for a long time, get along great, close friends) shows signs of liking me, but I doubt my own instinct and try to get over her. She stops showing those signs, I start talking to another girl, M. M has a history of on and off relationships (2 days was the most recent lasting), but she seemed to like me. I ask her on date, she says yes, but has to check if she doesn't have other plans. She said that 3 days ago, and she still hasn't told me if she can. So I give up on M.    My teacher gives us the Black Door lecture, saying we should try new things, that we could fail miserably or greatly succeed. That got me thinking about B. I made a mistake about not trusting my own gut feeling and trusting what could go wrong, not what could go right. So I try for B again. I haven't ever gotten over B since I started liking her, just tried to. Anyways, I start showing some serious signs of my feelings towards her, and she starts showing more of hers today. (One thing I noticed, and it could be nothing, but she walks very close to me (close enough to graze my hand and arm the whole time we walk) and with other guys she walks about a foot away from)      I know this may seem confusing, but I have thought about this and just want some strangers' opinions. I made a huge mistake and might have let her down by talking to this M girl. I want to ask B to a movie next weekend for V-day, as she is going out of town this weekend (by the way, would it be a good idea to text her while she's away).   We are all in high school, just so that's clear.    I think I am in love with this girl... its hard to believe from what I've written, but I truely believe that I am. So please, help me out, what should I do?
20090204185036AAlzcNo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would this scare you off?	Unfortunately three years ago it started having epileptic fits in my sleep in the middle of my GCSE's (yeah wot timing!!) but in the last year I've been put on medication that's working and that's all well and good. The thing is I'm into this girl and the other day she saw me taking my meds and began to ask what I was doing, Normally I wouldn't care to tell people but the thing is I thought maybe if I did I stood less chance of going out with her because she'd be afraid something could happen. I said it was paracetamol and walked away. I know she likes me too but I don't want to scare her! What do people think I should do? Would it scare anyone else to date someone who has a medical condition even if it doesn't effect them on a day to day? Any help appreciated!

20090204172355AAGhqIi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Should i just move on n forget about her?	i was going out with this girl n she really was in to me n the beginning and then things just went bad. She said she wanted to slow down and she stopped caring about our relationship in my opinion. She didn't call me as much and when i called her to talk to her we would talk for a short amount of time n she would say she would call me back and she never did. Sometimes she acts like she could care less about us and then sometimes she shows me signs that she still cares. She called me up and asked me to go to the movies with her but then she ended up flaken on me.So she really was pissing me off,confusing me and breaking my heart at the same time. So i just said F$#! it and i stopped calling without saying anything. For about 2 months i did not talk to her at all but i still missed her. I felt like the relationship was just unhealthy and i needed to just move on even though i still had feelings for her. I heard from people that some other guy was trying to get at her n they had started going out so i really thought it was over and i have to admit it hurt bad. But not that long after i found out about this some friends of mine called me because they wanted to hang out and when i got to the hang out spot she was there. I was shocked she ran to me and gave me a big hug. The whole time i was just actin natural n jus kind of showing no emotion but when i looked at her she would give me this crazy stare sometimes i don't know why. But when it was all over i heard from my friends she was kind of mad at because i kind of just ignored her and acted like we were never close. So know im just lost i thought this new guy took over but i heard he is mean to her so now i don't know what to do. I think she still likes me but i don't know if its worth risking my heart again but i do love her.

20090204165716AAGtfI1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me? I NEED to know!!!?	I met this really pretty girl whos in one of my classes. Shes shy and so am i. But for some reason she didnt seem shy to talk to me and she talked to me casually asking me questions about the homework, and gradually when we became closer, she began talking to me about television shows and other things. She gradually began saying hi and smiling at me sometimes. But other than that and the socializing that i do with her is probably the only signs she gives me. I do see her looking at me sometimes and giving me eye contact. One day, i was talking to a girl, specifically one of her friends, and when i talked to her later on, she seemed normal, she didnt seem jealous or upset about me talking with another girl and a few other girls whom she saw me with. She seemed to be normal. Does this mean she doesnt like me? What other signs do you think she would give me if she liked me?

I think she's pretty hot, and i'd date her in the future. The other day, i almost bumped into her in the hall, and i said sorry. She never replied. But a few days later, i could her looking at me outside, and it was at a pretty far distance, but when i noticed her she looked away quickly. Then she looked back again maybe a minute later. Does she like me or is she testing me if i like her?

20090204192738AA0i9ci	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! How do I deal with a guy I turned down?	I met the guy at the local college sign-up several months ago. We corresponded by e-mail for a time, and he said that he wanted to meet in person, even if just as friends. I kept putting it off, and was worrying because the e-mailing couldn't go on. I had been in a weird mood the day I gave it to him, and regretted it later.   Finally I let him know that I wasn't interested, but it was really hard and awkward, and I still feel kind of bad about it.      The next sign-up is coming up, and we're sure to meet. I don't know how to act. It's a small space, so we can't really talk and then move away from each other. What should I do??

20090204161448AApzftL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get this guy to like me?	im a girl. i have a crush on a guy. i dont even bare to talk to him. i try to prevent him because i cant stop looking at him, or he will know i like him. If he knew, I liked him he will tell his friends witch will tell the whole school. Soon, people will think as me as a freak. Cause I am a freak, technically. He's not populaur, but he gets along with the pops. and i think he likes this other girl that i see him talk to in lunch sometimes and hallways. The only class i have with him is Spanish. But since Januray this new girl came in and got every boy's attention. Im really shy and don't talk alot in school. I know i wont get him... cause im asian and have glasses and people say i have a speech impediment like i say my r's as w's. But I wasn't born in asia. I lived in USA for my whole 12 years.... How do I get this guy to like me? or get more into me?

We're in our 30yrs shouldn't he have called by now??       What would you do?

My boyfriend has a child with his ex and was married to her at a point because he felt he had to because of the child. How do i adjust with the fact that he has a kid and has been divorced? Me and his ex do not get along whatsoever mainly because she was harrassing us so bad and calling my job plus she tells her kid to hate me and not talk to me( i know she did because the child told my boyfriend) and anything i would give her her mom would break or throw away right in front of her and tell her not to take anything i give her. so the past couple months when shes been coming here for her weekend she wont even talk to me (shes almost 6) or really acknowledge me because of her mom telling her to ignore me. what should i do?

20090204155258AAnKyiO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a man splits up with a girl because he doesnt want the hassle, why does he call and text daily?	We dated since last April, but split just before Xmas as he says he is unsure that he wants a relationship, and he thinks we argue too much and he doesnt want hassle.  He initiated the relationship and chased me for over a year before i fell for him and started dating.    He is a workaholic and going through a divorce with his wife, and a lot of the arguments came about because of his hectic schedule meaning we couldnt meet up so much. He is not married now, but going through court for custody of his little boy. He had split from his wife before we got together.    Since we split we havent met up. (so its not about sex as we dont meet up)    Since we split, he says he cares about me and calls and texts EVERY DAY. Today, when i couldnt answer the phone as i am ill with a bad cold and was sleeping i had 5 missed calls, a text and a voicemail.    However, he maintains he doesnt want a relationship "at this moment" but if he ever did, i "would be the one he would choose".    So... my question... if a man splits up with a girl because he doesnt want the hassle, why does he call and text daily?? Why does he bother to stay in contact when he says he doesnt want a relationship?    I find this behaviour a bit odd... but to me he is my best friend, so i still talk to him when he phones and answer his text. We talk about work and general things, basically we behave like very close friends although he does all the initiating with the contact

20090204172753AALFvhO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he lying? I'm so close to snapping sigh.?	Hi, Basically I wanted to go to a music festival, and I asked my live-in b/f about it, he didn't want to go, so I bought up the idea of going by myself but with our mates so i wouldn't be stranded or anything. As its a 7hour dirive away it would be a whole weekend thing and involve overnight stays away and stuff.      He flatly refused, wouldn't work on trying to compromise with me and wouldn't explain why he was against it and told me to "drop the topic and don't bring it up again"      Funnily enough this really annoyed me as I felt like he didn't trust me and didn't think i wa capable of looking after myself for a weekend.      So last night I calmly, attempted to talk about it with him (note it was about 3 weeks ago that he told me to drop it) and I didn't ask to go or anything I asked him his reasons for not wanting me to go and tried to get how he was feeling out of him so I could understand him rather then just being grumpy at him      Anyway, he comes out with (note after I've burst into tears cause he was being a jerk) "it was meant to be a surprise but I've organised with your boss for you to have te whole week off, two of our mates are in on it and are helping organise transport and accomodation.       And just some of the things he said, didn't quite seem to add up. So i msgd one of the guys involed this morning and he replied with "eh?" and then I spoke to another friend and he claimed ignorance....      so are they trying to protect the secret even though I said I knew about it, or do they honestly have no idea, and my b/f lied to me last night?      i just dont want to go off at him for lying to make me happy if he wasn't but at the sae time if he was telling the truth how come theres no leave on the register for me, and no money spent in any of our accounts that I can't account for?      Sorry its so long :(

20090204161319AAjMZLy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a guy explain his behavior to me please?	I met this group of guys the other day and we partied at their house together. I kissed one of them two nights in a row and he wanted to do more, started touching me all over but I took his hands off and left. I really like him but he seems to be a party boy, so I guess it will go nowhere. I found out his other friend thought I was hot, so the next time I went over there, I started flirting with his friend. While we were talking the other guy kept looking at me periodically, but I kinda ignored him. Did this get him jealous? He also tried to do something with a random girl the night before but got shot down again, so if he is such a manwhore, why did he look like he was jealous that i was talking to the other guy? Or does he think I am a slut?

I have met a few people that way but never dated them - they all turned out to be freaks.    I am finding it hard to meet a great guy - or one that I click with anyway.    I'm 25. I don't want to meet anyone online because they all turn out to be freaks and I never have anything in common with them.    I'm thinking of still trying to meet someone elsewhere but giving up on the online thing. I know this will greatly reduce my odds of meeting someone though.

20090204205125AAy5bAC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE ANSWER!!!! What should I do about THIS!!!!???	was on msn last Monday and my ex-bf said hi to me. It was Chinese new year so he said happy new year! Then he said "Hope you stay beautiful forever"  What does it really mean? He also said he wants to have dinner with me...He said he wants to see me and we both agreed that next week is a better time for us both. Then he asked for my number on Monday and said he would call me in later on this week. I gave my cell # & told him that it doesn’t have caller ID, so if I miss it to try again another time or to text me. Today (Monday), one week later, I got a text from someone saying"hey wats ur schedule like". I asked who it was was, he replied, it was my ex indeed. I said "oh haha we can talk later...".    I went on msn  to talk to him instead of texting back. I kinda don’t wanna see him cuz I know how he is, we met up once before, it went bad. Neways on msn, I asked him first when was good, he said this week was bad, but the following Friday is good. I said I’ll be busy. Then he said “haha, why is it so hard to see you?” I said “why do u wanna see me? He said “cuz I miss u?” Why did he put a QUESTION MARK at the end? He's not sure if he misses me?? Then I told him thr truth how I kinda don’t wanna see him. That I do but I don’t. I asked if he really wants to see me, he said “I do, why else would I ask”. Then I said maybe to the Friday date but for him to ask me again. He said he will. At the end, I said “One more thing, you’ll have to try harder if u wanna see me hehe :P”. Based on the conversation would he say he likes me, has feelings and really wants to see me? Was it bad of me to be honest with him? I went on msn now and he didn’t even say hi, if he REALLY misses me & wants to see me shouldn’t he try more, like talking to me, on msn or phone?? What’s the REAL reason he wants to see me? Just to see me, or does he wanna date again? Should I ask him if he wants to try again? He’s sending mixed messages and its confusing me!!!   BTW we never had sex while dating cuz he knew I wanna save it for marriage, so don't he wants sex.

20090204224516AAWxiaM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell this guy that I have V-day plans, when I don't, so I don't seem like a loser?	So I met this guy that I sorta like, and I know he likes me too, and I think that he might ask me to spend valentine's day with him. He's not my boyfriend or anything, we're not even technically dating, but I still think he might want to spend v-day together.      I read in Cosmo magazine, and friends have told me, that a girl should sort of play hard to get, but not too hard to get. This year I have no plans for v-day, but should I tell him that I do so I don't seem available to him 24/7? I just think that if I spend v-day with him, hardly knowing him, it seems like I'm a loser and I had no plans on v-day and that I'm not playing hard to get *at all* and that's not good.      What should I do?      (And please be nice!)
20090204184732AAAc3Fv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship dilemma.... I hope someone could help me...?	I'm going steady with my boyfriend on its way for 4 years now and from my user name Ms. Confused and bored, I really am. You see, I'm in this situation when I met him I was this cute innocent fresh graduate girl, having no problems with life. Then my boyfriend came and he pursue me, then he taught me a lot of things in life. From work, how to be strong so that people will not stepped on you, how to dress properly not just a flirtsome. He even introduced me to God and a lot lot more. He even helped me in my business and taught me how to act as a respected manager. In short he act as my mentor. But as time goes by, we've been arguing a lot because of his family. He really has a big family inside his home like his dad has two wives and the 2 family resides under the same roof. The two wives happen to be sisters and the first wife commits suicide when she learned that her sister was the mistress (but actually that was long time ago). But now they are reaping the fruits of what they sow, because his dad now is a bankrupt man, no savings, no job, a homeless man. And now Im confused because should I take his misfortunes of his family as a basis for his future or not?

20090204152452AAolQwX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PROM- need courtesy advice?	If you haven't heard everything from my previous questions then I'll just summarize:      I'm taking one of my friends to prom. She and I have been friends for a while and were going in a big group of our friends. There is a picture party first but the host isn't allowing cars to be there through the duration of the night, which includes a co-ed sleepover. Personally I think that most of the couples are going to be hooking up throughout this gigantic house but I don't know if my date knows/thinks this and I am really having second thoughts about the sleepover, not that I would do that with her, but it would most likely be weird unless she actually liked me more than friends.      So my question is this:      I was going to go pick her up to go the picture party but since there are no cars allowed I am left with two options: take my car and pick her up, forcing her and my parents to drive themselves to take pictures and take my car back home OR just ride with our respective parents and not have the opportunity to go meet her at her house, which I think is what most prom dates do (not sure this is my first time going (junior year by the way))       Also I'm not sure whether or not the tickets were included in our class dues, meaning i dont know whether or not I will have to buy them. I was going to buy the tickets for both of us but if they are "free" I will feel like an a-hole for not paying for anything of her's besides the corsage of course.      So the party bus and dinner is near $100 a person for the night, so if prom tickets are free should I pay her back for her bus/dinner? I just feel weird about this.      Any advice is appreciated, thanks

20090204154530AAQ8Kmi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont know how I should handle this......?	I have a month one old son. And just for some background, the father broke up with me when i was 7 1/2 month pregnant and was married to his ex by the time i was 8 1/2 months. I trusted him and his ex throughout our relationship because they went to the same church and he said they were just friends. fast forward past all the heart ache and pain to now a month after i have my son. Me and the father are trying to be friends and partners in parenting and thats all. we were friends before the pregnancy and we dont want our son to have the kind of parents that hate eachother. He hurt me so badly i still cry when i feel weak but he doesnt know it. Anyways his now wife at first would sit in the car when he came to visit his son. He could only stay 5 or 10 minutes at a time because she was waiting. I just came alone a few days ago and stayed for 15 minutes and fed his baby for the first time and she was calling and argueing with him the whole time he was here.Now she has decided that since "they are one" and the bible says (they are very religious) that the spouse comes before the child, he is not allowed to see his son or step into my house unless she is allowed as well. which she is not. I can hardly breath through the pain as it is knowing she is sitting in a car outside my home. I could never have her in here.  So how should i handle this? am i wrong for not letting her in?  I just want what's best for my baby and i want him to have a relationship with his dat while he's still very litte so that he will feel secure when he began going over to his house. how should i handle this girl. I'm 31 he's 22 she's 21. I know that's a big difference but we planned this baby and i thought we were very much in love at the time.

20090204161125AAzzfLG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: Is this a turn-on or a turn-off? [repost]?	Lets say you meet a girl. Lets call her Sara.   You like Sara. One day you guys get to talking. And you tell her you like her. Sarah says she likes you, too. Then she goes on to tell you that she has never had a boyfriend before. She's still a Virgin, and she's never been kissed. Keep in mind that both of you are 18.      Would that change the way you feel about her?      A girl who's never been touched by any other guy: Hot or Not?

20090204155925AA1GEL6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't I talk to guys?	So, I am a 16 year old female, and I have never had a serious boyfriend. I also do not have any guy friends. The only guys I talk to are effeminate ones. I don't know why guys don't like me. I am not overweight, ugly or anything of that nature. I am definitely not a homosexual or anything, but I just don't feel comfortable around guys. They just don't take an interest in me. What is wrong with me?

20090204164927AAf32zU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever had sex with a woman you did not like?	I'm a guy and last weekend I was at a party and got pretty wasted. This girl who I work with totally threw herself at me and we ended up having sex. She has done it a few times at nights out and up until now I've only ever got off with her but even though I don't really fancy her I still got turned on by her and kissed and now I've slept with her. I know it's wrong but I don't get to many offers of sex and so if I do it's hard to turn down.   I feel bad cause I think she really likes me but she is just not my type at all. She has a degree and is sort of posh were as I am pretty rough and from a poor background. I will have to see her at work tomorrow for the first time since the party and I am dreading it as I know she'll be looking at me with her big brown eyes hoping to be asked out and I just can't do it.      I just don't understand how I could let this happen, if I had never started getting off with her in the first place she would have got the picture and moved on to some other guy but I've led her to think I might actually like her but am just being shy or something.       What should I do and guys have you ever had sex with a girl you don't like?      P.S. I am 25 and she is 22 and she's not a sl*t as she seems to be into only me at the moment.
20090204162949AAVAp4P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I have a hard time looking at men in the eyes?	I never used to have this problem, I always was able to look directly at a guy and used to love getting compliments from guys telling me how pretty my eyes are. Now it's like I'm scared or shy, something, especially when it comes to guys I'm attracted to. How do I get over this? I don't want to come off as having low self esteem or no confidence!

20090204182015AAOqUzQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So you gave this girl a present at school...?	I gave this girl's friend a teddy bear to give to the girl because I'm too scared and I really like the girl. When she came back, she said the girl that I liked thought it was weird. What does that mean?!?!? Do I still have a chance? I'm depressed -.- (listening to Fergie- Big Girls Don't Cry) haha.
20090204164926AAuu3Vw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it weird my gf wont let me meet her friends?	all her friends are totally chill with lesbians.  so i know that that's not the problem. but one time her bestfriend jessica called me telling me she was cheating on me with her?   my gf denied all if it.  she only admitted to having a thing with jessica a month before dating me.  and it's been 4 months since we started dating.  i always mention how it makes me sad how i can't meet her friends. she's met my friends many of times!   when i bring it up she says "i'm sorry" or she says shes embaressed of them. even though i made it clear how i won't judge!   i dont know what to do, i don't want to annoy her or loose her and i really hope she's not cheating on me.
20090204162150AAO6WBu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it odd that I've never dated anyone at 15?	I know some might say of course not, but really, when was your first date? I'm a 15 year old guy, btw, and I've never had the guts to ask a girl out, but I kind of subconsciously tell myself that there's no point in dating until at least one of us is 16, then we can drive ourselves to the movies/restaurant/etc. without our parents driving us around.      But I've never had a kiss from a girl other than family, but in a family way, not a sexual love kind of way, lol.      So what I pretty much want to know is:      1. When was your first date?   2. Girls, do you prefer a guy who asks you out, or do you care who arranges the date?   3. Girls, could you ever see yourself accepting your bf as a crossdresser? (Had to get some LGBT in there somewhere, lol, :P, I am straight though)      Ok, thanks.

When she was in grade 10 she had a child and now she is single. Our prom is coming up and i want to ask her out.

I'm broke and he never pays!?	not to sound stuffy or anything cause i dont mind paying for myself when we go places, its just that my boyfriend never even offers to pay for me. we've only been together for two months, but this is going to get expensive real fast, because he is always, always wanting to hang out and go somewhere, which is totally fun, except that i dont have a job during the school year because my dad doesnt want me to get distracted from my school work. i dont want to tell him i dont want to hang out, cause i do! i just cant afford this!!

Ocassionally, I will see him look at me in class. We both had to go out of the classroom and I have to do a test and he is leaving the class to switch so he sat out there too at the same table. First, we were quiet, then i said "I cant do this test" and we started to talk about class and stuff, and he told me some story, and while telling me, he kept studdering, and fiddling with his pencil, and couldnt even look at me... it was kinda cute. I went back to my test and we talked a little bit more... I left to go turn in my test, and i feel stupid i didnt ask him.. but yet he would of asked me for my number or soemthing if he liked me... Do you think he does? I know im over analzying but i really want to know.

20090204171415AAG0R71	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Kissed another boy and i have a boyfriend!!! SHOULD I TELL HIM?	So I was at a party and really extremely drunk. Now i know this is no excuse for my actions, but I have a boyfriend of 1.5 years and I kissed another guy. It was just like a peck, no makeout session or anything like that. My boyfriend was really upset that I went to this party and everything and he asked me if I cheated on him. I never cheated on him prior to this incident, so I said no. I don't think that it is worth telling him about to get him all worked up over nothing, and then our relationship would  be completely trashed. He has also stated to me that if he ever found out about me cheating he would make my life a living H e l l. This entire situation is wayyyy out of my character, and I never party or anything like that. What should I do? should I just keep it a long lost secret and vow to never let that happen again?
20090204200806AAYgZlC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I fall for guys that can only see me as a friend? :/?	Im 19 years old   A college student (sophomore)   Single      There are times that I think about getting into a serious relationship with someone and get things settled. I know im still young and still have a lot ahead of me, but when it comes to "dating" I always end up liking the guys that can only see me as a friend, nothing more, nothing less. I try to be more than a friend, but that makes me just feel awkward and it seems like im pushing them to give me a chance.    I have like 3 guys that like me and they are the sweetest guys ever, but I just dont seem to see them more as a friend. Its not like I wouldn't give them the opportunity to try to work things out, its just they aren't the type of guys im sorta into.      The more I think about wanting to get in a relationship, the more I feel like giving up and not even try to find someone.   I've always been told that the right one would come to me, but im just anxious to know already.   I've been hurt plenty of times with previous relationships I had with the ex's. and since then I've been having some trust issues when it comes to honesty.   I just hate being the friend and nothing more, but oh well I guess I just have to deal with it.

I was walking to the office,I see this cute guy I liked who was also going the same way, as I approached the office doors, (he was going into a diff. part of the office which was like 3 doors away from where I was) I guess he noticed me coming and started staring at me and he kinda paused at the door just for a sec door and stared, it got awkward so I looked away and walked in..when I walk in the office I saw him standing there,he looked over at me &stared or something, I got embarrased and just looked down and started playing with my hair      So what do you think? I don't want to get my hopes up or anything.

20090204223931AAb1Wu7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Argh!! i like him then i don't and i don't know what to do!?	i've literally given up on my feelings for this guy in the course of 2 days, i think i can like him, but then i don't, he told me that he does like me but i have a really big hunch that he's a player, but everyone that knows him tells me that it seems like his feelings for me are real and that he's a great guy, but i can't help but not feel for him when i see his body plastered on his profile pic, its like wtf? its hypocritical to him once telling me that he doesn't want to show his body because that's showing off, and after i delete my page he goes and takes pics of his body, besides, i've noticed he compliments a lot of other women, and i dunno, i think i'm giving it too much thought, honestly tho, its driving me crazy and i don't know what to do, i feel like going back to my ex but that's over with...what should i do?
20090204185055AADLFw8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me, or not?	It sort of seems like this kid likes me, but I'm not exactly sure.   Mostly because of our differences. He's popular, a jock you could say. I'm not at all popular, and punkish. (I hate labeling myself, but this is just for you information.)   I catch him staring at me often, as we are in most classes together. We both look away when we see each other.   Usually, he talks to everyone, but he doesn't really talk to me.. I guess probably because I'm shy, but I don't know.   Your opinions, please?

20090204185800AALIPNJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told my guy friend how I felt about him?	In a conversation recently and only after he hinted that he may be interested in more than friendship did I tell him that I basically liked him.  He didn't say much just listened.  Didn't say "Oh I like you as just a friend" or anything.  After hesitating to tell him he reassured me that I had nothing to worry about.  So what's the problem?  Well I CAN'T freakin' read him.  I think he's a Scorpio sign don't know if this means anything.  He didn't seem surprised or turned off just calm...and I don't know what to think.  Is he just being nice by not turning me down or is it possible that he might feel something for me as well?  Do guys usually react this way after a girl tells them they like 'em?      Please no sarcastic I don't believe in horoscope answers please.  Mostly guys but girls opinions are welcomed.

Shes usaully the one who breaks up with me but we have been broken up for about a month and about 2 weeks ago i told her i still really liked her, she kinda jus said ok and didnt really say anyhthing, but then a week ago she told me that she liked me so i was thinkin that we were about to get back together.

20090204170640AAooSPI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: Do you think she's interested (please answer)?	I was talking to this girl I used to work with last week (when I worked with her I never talked to her). At the end of the conversation I told her she should give me her number. She gave it without hesitation and even seemed eager when I gave her mine. I wasn't sure if she was interested (I think she has a bf, so that's why) but I thought "what the hell" and gave her a call. I suggested that we go out and grab a drink together. She immediately asked me when. I asked her what her schedule was and she told me. Unfortunately our schedules didn't match. I then told her I'd give her a call in a few days so we can figure out when to meet. She did seem enthusiastic. I have yet to call her but I was still wondering if she was interested. Why would she agree to go out and get a drink with me if she had a bf (to me drinks is kind of like something you do with someone you want to date). Maybe I'm analyzing this too much. Also, do you think it's ok that she's 5 years younger than me? Thanks.

20090204184248AACdJGg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do guys like it when girls pursue them?	I went on a date with this guy who's my friend and a few weeks later I texted him to hang out, and then when he said he would call but never did I called him up. I didn't think it was a big deal and I was just trying to be casual about it, but I think this turned him off to me or made me seem pushy. So I guess my question is do guys like it or not when a girl calls him instead of waiting for him. I am kind of an impatient person and I generally do what I want, but does this make me seem desperate or pushy?

We started being off and on and finally off but he still e-mails or comes around every now and than. We're not having sex. As a matter of fact the last time he came over he didn't even try to touch me. I just don't understand why he won't just leave me alone. I'm cool with it if he wants to come and be apart of my life and us have some terms of our relationship but i can't take this in and out off and on.

20090204182659AAnhiMT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get over him?	Ok, so I've liked this guy for about 5 months now... there have been rumors going around for about 2 months that he and his ex are secretly going out. I decided to try and ignore that because it was putting my through more pain than I was already in. And both of them denied that they were going out. But my friend is kind of friends with that girl, but not really close. And she has told my friend that they are going out.... I'm heart broken. And it is kind of obvious that they are going out. I always knew that there was a big possibility that they were either going out or had feelings for each other because they are always together. And now that it's confirmed I'm absolutley heart broken and I've noticed that I'm not really hungry anymore and I'm never really happy for long periods of time. Only the little things make me happy. I'm generally always sad, but I put on a happy face everyday. I've noticed that if I don't see him or talk to him for periods of times like 4 days.... I get a little better... but once I see him again its bam. And I go right back to where I was. I see this guy almost everyday. I go to school with him. How do I get over him seeing him so many days a week? I've been trying to avoid him lately but I feel like I NEED to talk to him, I'm happy after that, but the happiness doesn't last long. And seeing him with her everyday breaks my heart. I've been telling myself that all that matters is that he is happy. But I need to be happy too right? How am I supposed to get over him? This hurts.

20090204185111AAawOI4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do men hurt good women?	I am a 39 year black female and I met the man when I was eighteen and we dated until I was thirty three.  He had problems and I stood by him. We he returned he told me either we get married that day or we wouldn't. I wanted a big wedding. Needlessly to say things got worse and he moved out into his own apartment. While we lived apart I thought we were working things out. He cheated on me with another woman, i found out when I called his apartment and she answered. He denied it but needlessly to say she was pregnant and they got married. They have been married going on eight years but they live together two months and then break up for six. The past summer he said he was getting divorced. He showed me papers and told me that he would do everything to make things right. I helped him find what  I thought would be our place and furnish it.  He worked out of town so we didn't spend a lot  of timtogetherer until I found out he wasn't out of town all of the town he was at his wife's apartment. Now he is back with his wife and acts as if I am wrong for not having anything to say. I am a good woman and deserve better. My question how do I leave this feeling behind and why do men hurt good women?

20090204211752AAbeu6Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was what I did to this girl mean?	I broke up with my girlfriend for 5 months because she cheated on me while drunk. During this time I got involved with this really shy, sweet, classy girl. She has a history of depression and an eating disorder. It was the first time she has opened up to someone in a long time and she would always tell me ''Please don't hurt me.'' and I told her I wouldn't do anything to hurt her. We started to like each other. She thought I was a strong person for breaking up with my girlfriend and that I deserved so much better. I do drugs and she would always tell me I was better than that. I used to always bad mouth my at the time ex gf in her presence calling her a **** and saying I could never settle down with someone like that. I make it clear to her that I was over that girl and wanted a future with her. Once I started university and she got busy with her part time job we didn't see each other as much and I told her it was because I was busy with school. My ex gf came back into the picture and the feelings started coming again. So I got back together with her (yes, the one that cheated on me) She claims that she got counselling for her drinking and says she wont cheat again. I told the classy girl this, and she was crushed. Her nickname on msn is ''trying hard not to think about how badly somebody hurt me, why shold i have to cry myself to sleep?" Do you think what I did was mean, considering I put into her head that we were going to be together..and since she was so sick in the past and I was the first person she opened up to in a long time? Also, do you think by going back to the gf that cheated is a good choice? Or would you think the other girl deserved a chance..

20090204201359AA9taDu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can someone tell me how to make a guy notice you without making yourself seem desperate?	Hi! I'm in a sometimes friends sometimes bf/gf relationship, it gets confusing after a while because I like him and I know he likes me at least a tiny bit or he wouldn't be around me in the first place. Anyway, I usually chat with him over MySpace and he rarely ever really notices me as his girlfriend even though in private we are definitely together. I'm starting to think he only wants me as a friend and rather string me along then put it to me straight, or that he wants to be with me in a serious way but doesn't know how to tell me...and I'm not sure if I should be in a relationship that is sometimes this and sometimes that, can someone help me out?
20090204184143AAu6lSN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really don't know wat to do.... help plz...!!?	Well.. here is the situation.. i live in a certain asian country.. but actually i m from another country...   it's just that.. there's a fri of mine whom i really love... and i really had a very bad reputation when it comes to dating women.. actually.. she and i are now working in the same office.. i met her some 6 months ago.. when i first met her.. i thought her just like another woman and i didn't care at all.. as a man, and here i ve to be honest, i enjoy flirting.. so.. i at first started flirting with one of her best fri... but it was nothing.. i swear.. i also enjoyed occasional flirting with her but.. at that time.. i thought like.. she was nothing to me.. the problem started 2 months later after we met.. at that time.. i had this regular gf.. and i also talked about my gf..in front of her a couple of times.. but at the same time.. i started to fall in love with her..(and it was real).. believe me .. i ve never felt like this before. And I also confess that I freaked out when I found myself deeply in love with her.. she is not really beautiful.. and above of all.. she really is not my type.. but I can’t help falling in love with her.. so I stopped all my dating activities with another girls.. I even broke up my gf and eventually tried to win her heart… but.. the thing is she doesn’t believe even a word of mine.. I tried and.. tried and tried.. but only to get all my love thrown right back at me in the face. So.. at last .. I took a stab at forgetting the whole thing and starting again .. every night.. I talked to myself that it was just a dream and when I woke up.. it would be all ok again.. but every morning, when I saw her.. all I can say to myself  is “ my..god… she..is.. beautiful” and.. I just want to take her in my arms and tell her how much I love her.. and how much I adore her.. but it is killing me inch by inch that.. I could not tell her those things as I see her drifting away from me.. if only I knew that I would someday find someone I really fall for.. I wouldn’t date those girls ahead of her.. she is now dating some other guy.. and I can’t stand this pain.. it will break my heart to see her go…. what should i do???

20090204225110AAje4jf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over being cheated on?I'm scared... i think he's cheating. Suicidal?	How do you get over being cheated on? How do you get a guy to prove he wont'? I've been cheated on by many guys with many different girls. I didn't know till it was too late. They all said the same things, I love you i wouldn't do that to you. You're the only one for me, things like that. How many months did they drag it on? I'm in my 6th month of a "clean" relationship. clean meaning i haven't been cheated on. Maybe. My boyfriends myspace got cleaned out so he had to go request all new friends.(before he had a lot of hot girls as friends but i didn't care because I thought he never talked to them cuz they were old) And they are all girls for the most part. Girls I find much hotter than me and a threat. He has deleted a few I have talked to him about. the others he says he knows from high school. But we live in oklahoma and some are from alaska or pennsylvania. He also gets a lot of txts and a lot of calls from odd numbers he won't let me see. I'm scared I'm paranoid and picking stuff apart but I've learned I have to from previous relationships. he says all the above things and I'm somewhat reassured. But i'm still so leary about all of it. I don't want to tell him he can't have any "girl" friends, but he messages them all "thanks for the add. your very pretty and seem very interesting. I'd love to get to know you better. Hope to hear from you soon." What do you get from these type of messages?  I'm really scared. I love him lots and I want to trust him. Is this wanting what is making me reassured by his words? I'm in college so i'm not some silly heart broke high schooler whining about drama. I'm actually really scared. I'm so scared I've thought of death and how much easier it would be than this torment. He always answers with... nothing. She's no one. Just an old friend. You have nothing to worry about.

20090204160509AAtJYe7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do YOU call your loverboy (or girl)?	By their real name, some cute nickname or don't use names and just assume they know you're talking to them?     I feel weird addressing ppl by name in conversation, like I'm reminding myself of who they are.  But a generic nickname like "honey" or "sugar" is so abstract that it sounds like a cover up to prevent admitting your forgot their name or calling the wrong name.  So I don't use names in conversation.  what about you?
20090204184133AAAs1Ze	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why he didn't kissed me?	Something weird happened to me today. There's this guy I've been working with for a month. He's been flirty, and is what you can call a pretty boy, too pretty b/c he's HOT. He says he doesn't have a GF, which I doubt since he's quite popular.      He's been helping me in my job and he asked me commission on the type of help he's doing. Well, today we were all alone so we started getting cozy with each other, and we hugged. we looked each other and he smiled and I was expecting an approach from him to kissed me but just kept looking at me. I just smiled,move over and hugged and kissed him in the cheek. I'm 31 and he's 25 btw.      Why would he act like he likes me and yet he just looks ate me and tease me?

I have heard many stories about women making fun of guys that still live with their mothers.  I moved out of the family home at 19 and now I am 44.  I am divorced and have two teenage daughters.  My mother (approaching 70) indicated that once my kids move out, she may want to move in with me so she does not have to live alone anymore.  I plan on having her live with me, but now I am wondering if it will be a hindrance to dating.      Ladies, would you date a guy in my situation?  What would happen if we got married?  Would my mom have to move out?

20090204171052AAom78K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I have your opinions please?	On this poem: Thank you in advance.            Sometimes I see you in my thoughts and daydreams.   Always smiling, laughing.   Acting like you always do.   But in my heart I know,   That you would make me smile brighter,   Laugh longer.   Really live my life to its fullest.      We have a history, a scattered past.   I can see past it.   The hurt that you caused years ago,   But you can't see past our differences.   My vices, your strong beliefs.   Maybe it isn't so hard to compromise,   I'm willing, are you?      The distance, I agree, is daunting.   Summer is closing in each day.   We can make it work,   Can't we?   I met your family, they like me.   9 brothers and sisters with differing opinions,   But I fit in, I tried to.      You told me you were ashamed of yourself.   For wanting to take my virginity away.   Well what do you think of me now?   Some stoner, some **** partying away at college?   Maybe before, but thinking about you makes me stop.   It makes me stop and think about my actions,   And how I might be disappointing you.      I need to stop this back and forth confusion.   We either embrace the time we have together,   Or we look toward or time apart.      Either way we lose something.   Together, we lose our boundaries,   Our walls we put up to keep emotions in,   To keep each other out.   Apart, we lose the hope of that fire,   The fire that keeps rekindling inside us.      These constant feelings of my hopes being dashed away   Are slowly killing me inside.   And I want them to stop.

I feel a little like I've been leading him on because I've been e-mailing him but I'm just responding to HIS e-mails. I don't want to hurt his feelings, but honestly, I find him creepy, and I don't want to do anything that will cause him to stalk me.  Currently we are only communicating by e-mail. What should I do?  I may end up going back to that job in the spring so I don't want things to be awkward if I end up working with him again.      I don't want to just tell him I have other plans because I have a feeling he'll just ask me out again. I want to do something that will take care of this for good.

20090204195216AAVQM7T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just go for it ?	Okay...this is a little bit complicated...      In Jan of 07, i went to college. By Feb, I had the biggest crush on this girl in my class, Laura. But I was always finding excuses and by the time I wanted to make my move, she already had a boyfriend. And since i sat like a meter away from her everyday for 2 years, the crush blossomed to crazy ******* love. For 2 years, I repressed it because she was immensely happy with her bf and Laura and I were good friends by then. I didn want to screw that up.      About 2 months ago, she broke up with her bf cos he was cheating on her. Anyway, I was one of the first few people she told. And since then, there are moments when we are incredibly close then distant.       So, heres the question finally...      Laura, myself and a couple of friends are heading to an island for a beach holiday and it just happens to coincide with Valentine's Day. After 2 years, I really want to move on. But i dont think i can do that without telling her how i feel. So, SHOULD I JUST GO FOR IT ?      or should i never tell her cos it might destroy our friendship.      p.s. we have the same circle of best friends. So, should i risk it ?

20090204153132AAMqug6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex girlfriend opinion please?	ok so long story short were both 18 and we were together for 2 years. she broke up with me about a month ago because she said feeling started to fade and she didn't want to lead me on if the feelings werent there. after we broke up there was another guy there who was listening to her problems and she likes him and he likes her. she has no intrest in any relationship for awhile she told me but she still feels something for this kid. there certain things about him that are making her iffy about him and she also still isn't over me completely and still has some feelings for me. we decided to stay best friends. im not going to be making big effort to contact her so i dont seem needy and if she wants to talk she can contact me. my question is do you think that by keeping things like this do you think were going to get back together? do you think be me not making much effort will make her miss all the things we had during a relationship because she says she still thinks of me and the relationship at times. she tells me she really Truly believes that in the future we have a second chance. i just want to know if from what you know about our situation does it sound like she'll be coming back?

A great friend of mine let me borrow a fantastic pair of earrings for an awards show on MTV. She was my date for the show , we both went out and bought really nice expensive dresses for this and went all out. My friend let me borrow this great pair of earrings that I ended up keeping for a wedding, and somewhere along the way one of those earrings I lost. I only have one. The earrings are EXPENSIVE , and I cannot afford expensive I feel terrible, I told my friend that I am 100% at fault that I am terribly sorry and that I feel so so bad. She had stopped talking to me for a while and when I had made any attempts to contact her they were ignored. When I asked her best friend if she thought that was the reason she wasn't talking to me she said "come on she's got so much jewelry she doesn' t care'' she's really wealthy. That still didn't make me feel at ease and I still feel terrible. Well, finally last night I texted her "I haven't seen you in forever I want to see you b4 you leave for Australia" a few hrs later she texted me back with "I found the earrings you lost on sale $xxxxx" a price I can't afford I told her that is something I can't afford at the moment that I still feel horrible I only have one earring and that I know that wont do her any good. I will apply for a credit card at the store if I can get one I will def get them , if I can't that I will pay her as much as I can little by little until I can replace them. I cried myself to sleep last night I FEEL terrible please help what else can I do ?       p.s.    I'm 27 she's 26

After that I've been dealing with this guy for about 6 years now and I been trying get back with him for about a year now & it neva happen yet but we act as if we are a couples, like neither one of us can go out or have sex with the opposite sex but months ago I got pregnant and he decided to still be in my life and be the "stepfather to my son" which is his exact words and even his mother is acting like his grandmother. He claims my son to everyone has a good relationship with him but yet I still don't have that title & don't even know what my title is now. He told me we will be together one day but right now he just don't feel like he can trust me because of my past and that we have to stop have sex because he want to be responsible just out of the blue. He been aruging with me that he is not with someone else. THIS IS CONFUSING AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF HE DOES WANT TO BE WITH ME AND HES JUST NOT READY TO COMMIT OR OTHERWISE!
20090204160603AASN9qE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is kicking in the balls funny?	Why does everyone in a movie theater laugh when someone gets kicked in the balls? Do you laugh no matter what, or are you more prone to laugh if a girl is doing the kicking as opposed to being hit with a ball?      And when a girl kicks a guy in the balls, they ALWAYS giggle or laugh --- WHY?       My exes have done this too. Why is it go giggle worthy? Have you girls ever kicked a guy/your b/f in the balls? Why? Did you laugh?

20090204160946AAYvh0m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating someone four years older, confused about how to handle this?	okay, i'm almost 13 and he will be 17. I understand the age difference is big, but i really have feelings for him. I'm very mature for my age and so it makes the situation different. We are both okay with the age difference but our parents aren't. This may sound crazy because i'm so young but i really think i love him. He isn't using me because i've dated him over a month and we haven't even done anything. My mom doesn't know about it, and it really bothers me. He wants to talk to my mom and tell her how he feels about me but i dont know how she would take that. do you think my mom would just make us break up, or do you think she'd actually let us stay together? i guess what im asking is, what do i do??  we broke up for about three weeks and i was just starting to get over him and now we're dating him and idk if it was a mistake or not. so, please help me out. :)   thanks.         As a side note, he wants to get married right when i get out of school, and the way i know him he doesn't kid about stuff like this. so he's pretty serious about it. also, ive never really been a kid, i've always been mature and idk if i'm growing up to fast by getting in this relationship because it can get prettty serious i'm sure, idk i mean maybe i should just take time off and be a kid. but idk i really like him. so yes i'm in a ******* pickle, please help.

20090204163839AA9LHiB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think about this?	So as the title says I've got a problem. For one I'm really self conscious and moody. I'm  short tempered and nosy which i know can be annoying but once my curiousity is sparked I cant help but ask. I get really nervous when around people I'm not close to but extremely outgoing with my friends. I feel like no one understands me and keep my thoughts to myself. Mostly I care way too much about what people think about me. I hate my body and hide it under hoody and jeans . I dont bring attention to myself yet want to become a foreign correspondent.  I feel like i'm a hypocrite because i say things like " I want to show the real me" when the real me is a coward! But i dont want my friends to worry about me so i act the opposite.I'm alittle too honest . I guess i've got extremely low slef esteem and am really moody because I find myself invisible and ugly ,harsh as it is its true.  I guess this is really dumb to ask about but what do you all think guys find attractive and not attractive? I've always wondered but thought it weird to ask a guy about. Am i just stupid and overreacting or what? I dont get it. All my friends say i'm pretty and stuff along those lines but i cant seem to believe them. In fact I care more about my friends than myself. Is that weird? Is it normal?
20090204163900AAXDgcH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help from somebody mature?	my boyfriend and i have been together for over 2 years and have lived together for over a year now, and lately hes been kicking me out all the time because we were having problems. the last time that he kicked me out and then changed his mind and said he wanted me to stay, i told him that the next time he does it he better mean it because im really gonna leave. We have been doing really well for the past few months and havent been fighting at all, but the other night we got into a big fight over something stupid he kicked me out again. the fight was my fault but i apologized for it and he said he wasnted me to stay but i said i would not stay unless he apologized for kicking me out for something so small. He said he changed his mind and wanted me to stay but refused to apologize and said that if he did apologize, that he wouldnt mean it. he eventually apologized and said that he did mean it but now i dont know what to do. i dont know if i should believe his apology and just stay. i also dont know if i should stay because i told him that if he kicks me out again, then thats it. Should i leave for two weeks to make him realize that im serious or should i leave for good? or should i just stay??

20090204164924AAYHxfY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, am I a wimp...?	So I was walking to school today and I passed by a window and these girls inside their apartment window went, "hey! hey you" then they chuckled and "Ohhhh" kinda thing. I got scared but I felt they were attracted to me. I just ignored them like I didn't hear anything and continued going to school calmly. They were defiantly teenage girls from their voices- they were teens for sure (High school). I wanted to say something back and see what they wanted to say to me. But, I felt kinda stupid after.. fyi, there weren't people there at that time, the street was free from people I was the only one walking by. Some people outside their porch but nothing populated. I know the girls (2 of them) were talking to me first because well I was near their window that's how close they were but I went on. So, what would you guys do? Is it a big deal how would you handle that situation if it ever arises again? I'm not very well at handling things like this since i'm very humble and respect girls. Oh, and I get stared at by girls sometimes some of them say "hi" and stuff. But, I don't know what to do.

20090204165346AAg56i9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP PLEASE!! I can't get him out of my head!?	So I have known this guy for half a year, we are not very close friends, but I have developed feelings for him ever since. What troubles me is how inconsistent his behavior is towards me. We were all friendly with one another in the beginning, then there were times when he just "forgot" that he was suppose to call to hang out. We ended up hanging out with each other over the course of like a month, so I thought there was something there, but apparently there wasn't because he got cold just a few weeks after he asked me out.       If he sees me as just a friend, why did he ask me out? We don't even talk to each other anymore. What I am confused is the way he treated me was as if he liked me because he was flirty and he asked me if I had a boyfriends and all sorts. I just wanna save the friendship at least you know. The thing is, whenever I think he is gonna ignore me, he comes back in my life for a short period of time and would talk to me online.       Has he ever liked me more than friends or it was just me? What should I do if I still want him as a friend, yet not to seem awkward?      Thank you!

20090204170611AAEOpI0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Breaking up with my girlfriend?	This past Friday I started going out with this girl, she really really REALLY likes me.... Before then people kept on asking me about my feelings for her. I always told myself I just thought of her as a friend. At the school dance we had Friday, people kept on telling me to dance with her, she kept on pulling aside her friend, she told me that she was getting upset with me because I would not dance with her. Blah Blah blah, I ask her out later, but now I think I asked her out only because people told me to. I want to break up with her soon because I don't want to give her the wrong ideas any more.       So my overall question is, What should I include when saying "I don't wish to date you anymore"       -I am going to be telling her in person, I'm not a whimp.    -I'm scared that she might freak out really badly because shes sort of obsessed with me.    -should I have firneds in the back ground to comfort her after i'm done?

20090204174113AA2D66m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! Boy/Friend Problems?	Although this is a little embarrassing I have liked this guy for about 6 years now. He's a nice guy, but he's a complete player. He hasn't made it unclear that he doesn't like me, which is part of the problem. I want to get over him because, now because I have liked him for 6 years people think I'm obsessed with him, which I am NOT. I always try to get over him but then when I see him again, I start liking him again and all of these feelings come back. It's really hard to get over him and I know he's not good for me because he's not that into relationships and commitment. How do I get over him??? I've been trying my hardest but it's SOOOO hard! Also, my friends have not been nice to me at all about this situation. They've been making sarcastic, mean comments and they haven't made them before. Every time I say one little thing about him they're always like, "Adrienne, you're obsessed." And NOT in the nice way. Not like advice but like it's fact that I'm obsessed with him. My friends never get the message that this actually hurts my feelings. I need help!

20090204180320AAn1jum	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you help me?????????????	I asked a girl to the junior prom about two weeks ago. She said she'll think about it and she doesn't know if she's even going yet, she said she'll check with her friends. I didn't see her at all last week because we had midterms. I see her everyday in band class, I say hello to her everyday and surprisingly, she said hello to me first. Table requests and payments are going to be due soon. I'd like to make plans so I'd like to get a definite answer. If she's not going, I'm not going. How do I ask for a definite answer? I don't want her to feel obligated. What if she's afraid to say no and she doesn't want to go with me? If she's not going, I want to still go out with her. How do I ask her out? So in one conversation how do I get a definite answer, how do i know she's not afraid to say no, and how do I ask her out if she's not going?      Also, what should I say after I ask her?

20090204182537AAcK1jN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i deal with this? please help, i need it for tomorrow ~ thank you in advance & i will choose the best!?	okay, so here's a little bit of an introduction of myself:   well i'm a freshman in high school   there also seems to be a little bit of guy issues with me too   so the guy that's causing problems, let's call him: Bob   the guy i like, let's call him: Joe   and we'll call my guy friend/also friends with the guy who's causing problems, let's call him BobbyJoe    :)      anyways,   a situation (one that's quite embarrassing for me, and something so bad that no one should go around talking about to other people because it's a really sensitive area of my life) happened to me about two years ago. so that's something that should've been completely done with shouldn't it be? well, i liked Bob and Bob (seemed to) like me too (but i'm not completely sure if that's true or not you know?). but lately since i got into high school, i'm kind of into the guys that are older because they have more maturity and all that, but i still kinda liked Bob too, just a little bit. and when Bob found out that me and Joe talked, he told him about my situation and also told him all these lies that are false accusations, and he also told him that he shouldn't talk to me anymore. so Joe told me about it, i had to kind of force it out of him who it was, but i'm not allowed to say anything to Bob about it, or at least not say that it was Joe that told me.       and you might be wondering what ever happened to BobbyJoe:)   well this is the part that he comes in at:)      Bob and BobbyJoe are really good friends, they hang out all the time, so wouldn't you think that they'd share the same opinions on things? and also not talk to the same people?? because this is the part that confuses me, BobbyJoe comes and talks to me nearly everyday, and today he came to hug me twice with Bob with him, Bob also knows that me and BobbyJoe are JUST friends.      so, what could this mean?? could he possibly know that i like guys like Joe?? what should i do?? it's so difficult for me to hold back anymore:(      so if you can help, it's greatly appreciated. and i will definatly choose for best answer:) thankyou for reading this LONG question:)

20090204185540AAOPJDu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend has lost interest at me? what to do?	i've been with her for a year now. first few months was good, she was all nice and all over me. but lately she changed alot, she is always cranky over little things and try to boss me around. im too scared of her being angry, i can't even ask her to move her feet off the sofa so i can sit, or ask her for half the shopping cost where she promised to pay but forgot(may be)      when it comes to sex, she used to be all over me and want sex all the time, and now. when i get horny she will always find some excuse to get away. once every blue moon she will say 'do u wanna hav sex or not, if yes hurry up and finish' she even told me she didn't wanna hav sex with me.      if she no longer wants me why she not leave. is it because of the money?   we are renting an apartment and we pay 50/50 on rents. but i pay for alot of things in house like fridge, washer, furniture, groceries. and last year i bought her expensive gift(laptop). but with the rental, she has the least all in her name(bond money in her name even i paid most of it). so if we break up, i'd be the one moves out and she will get all the stuff. (it's hard to resell the or take the furnitures with me). if we break up, i lose thousands(even it's already dead money), she sometimes buy me stuff too, but they are like $20, while she is making alot more money than me from work. so consider the money side, she should be happy if i leave.      i feel really bad i feel like i am just getting mercy to live here, while she can ask me to leave anytime.      is her behaviour mean she no longer interest at me? is there any way she can love me again? or should i just go back on the street?

20090204191620AAhb30x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She is really getting annoying and pissing me off!?	Ok so a friend of mine, were hanging out, and well we somehow started to talk about marriage, and she(Emily) said what if her and I were to get married. We sort of joked about it, and had some fun. But she the started to take it too far.      It got to the point where she said that she would tell the girl (Lucy)that I currently like that she should back off and that I am happier with her(Emily). She said other things but they were minor....But I really felt bad, when she talked about lucy, I mean she was joking, but I felt like she was mad at me or did like lucy. Very hostile in the way she talked about lucy.      This gets really annoying because some many guys are all over Emily and I am guessing she thinks she can have her way with any guy. She is cool and all, but there is no way I am going to become one of her fools.       Why does she keep acting like this? And how can I stop it?      Thanks in advance!

20090204193218AAxgXHW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my female friend do this?	I have a very attractive friend, who basically seems to take an odd pleasure in staring at me. She seems to do it every chance she gets when she thinks I'm not looking. I mean, it's flattering but at the same time weird. I say that because I DO NOT believe she likes me, as I asked her out a while back and she pretty much said no. I mean, I'd "think" you wouldn't stare at someone you aren't attracted to, but meh *shrugs*  I WOULD ask her, but I'm not the confrontational  type and want to avoid the awkwardness...>_>      Why do girls do this? I'm confused...>_<

But the thing is he goes out with this other girl.    She doesn't really like him that much but if they were to break up I know that he would start liking me more.    Then he would get all flirty and maybe a 25% chance of him asking me out.    If he were to do that would I be a rebound?

I started seeing his friend first however , we didn't hit it off and I found that Rick liked me . We dated for 2 years and lived together . Even planning a wedding.

This was when things change, I started working full time and would come home to find out he was bike riding all day. He was gone until about 9:30 at night. I hated it. So the friend that we had together started to come and hang out together and we really connected. After a drunken night it came out that I had feelings for the friend that wasn't sexual but were there CUz he showed me attention when my bf didn't.. 3 weeks later we broke up and it was the worst break up I ever had . I recently emailed him cuz he went and told my mother that we were talking ...I still has his email password so I checked if he open it and he did and he also save it...Now should I move on or should I wait for him to come back in contact with me...And if I move on ....Please give me some tips its SO hard.

20090204201640AA5AsYC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please, help me understand men!!!?	I work at a bar and grill type place and everybody is pretty buddy-buddy with everyone..everyone that is, but my ex and I.  Back in the day he was crazy about me, but he said I pushed him away. We are very different people anyhow and I was going through some **** having just moved to a new city. We dated for like 2 months and he broke up with me like 3 months ago. It wasn't a bad break up and no one got hurt. Okay, it was kinda hard being  over 2,000 miles away from home and all my friends and family.      The thing is he was nicer to me right after he dumped me than he is now. Before he would at least say hi or offer me a ride home, but now even when we are out with our co-workers at bars he won't even look at me when I try to joke with him and he goes out of his way to avoid me at work. Other people have notice and says he acts anti-social when I am around.       What could I have possibly done to this guy? I told him at first I needed time before we can be friends and that I didn't want him to text me talk to me cause I was mad at him. I have since apologized and reached out to him and he now tells me we can't be friends, "because it just wasn't meant to be".       What is his deal?
20090204201726AAp3vg7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to convince girlfriend not to swing?	recently my girlfriend of 13 months (great relationship up to now tbh) caught me off guard by telling me that she wants to experiment with a black man because she thinks they are "so sexy."       Honestly i dont think i or her could go through with it but i feel like i am being forced to tell her i would let her because i have given her everything she has wanted, and i afraid that if i let her she will want to do it more than once and if i wouldnt give her that she would leave me.      I know i was her first and she was mine, is it so wrong of me to want this so stay a fantasy and not reality..but a part of me wants it to happen but i know theres no way i could EVER let it happen because i would never be able to look at her the same way.      Please dont think its because of the color of the mans skin, because i wouldnt want it to happen with anyone of any race color or sex, im so jealous i dont even want to have anything to do with another person male or female. Who would have ever thought a Male not wanting a 3 way with 2 beautiful women. :o      TLDR:    What can i say to my girlfriend to not want to do anything with another person?      Sorry for the long post and useless info i just kinda needed to vent also.

20090204222618AAdqUhO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my ex sending mixed signals?	About a month ago my ex girlfriend broke up with me a second time and said she was done with me.       I called her a week later, apologized, told her I was ok with being broken up, and refrained from talking to her for a whole month.      Then, a few days ago she called me out of the blue to tell me "she only dated me a second time for closure and told me there is nothing between us". I yet again told her I was ok with being broken up, and then cut our conversation short. Then recently messaged me online and asked me how I was doing.      I am confused and frustrated because she told me she was done with me and now is pretending like nothing happend. I'm frustrated because she hasn't apologized yet but acts like she wants some subtle friendship.      Why is she talking to me like nothing serious happend between us?      Am I frustrated because I want her to apologize for compensation for walking on me like she did?      And how should react appropriately to this? (I do want her back, but I want her chasing me if you know what I mean)

20090204223312AAhAvWD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Co-worker with girlfriend... you get the picture... (at least this one will be interesting?)?	iv had my current job for about 4 months. It's a great job, and i love my coworkers. When I first started I had a complete crush on one of my coworkers but discovered he had a girl friend and put all those kind of thoughts out of my head. Since then we've become good friends, and he is always telling me I'm his favorite co worker and trying to switch shifts so we work together. so basically all of a sudden buddy has been ALL over me, and we're even spending a day together this weekend. he definetly lets it known that he's attracted to me, and wants to spend time with me. its my birthday in a week and he's out of town, so he's organized a whole nother night for us to celebrate. Sooo ya... dilema. My head says: 1) he's got a girlfriend 2) we work together, we could lose our jobs 3) i dont know how serious his intentions are 4) i would feel reaaally bad if i was "that girl" 5) i think all my other coworkers would really look down on me if they found out     buuuuut that other part of me has all these feelings. you know the kind of feelings. and they come from really enjoying someones company and genuinely getting along. could anything work out here?
